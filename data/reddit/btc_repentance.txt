The problem is that incomplete information is useless.
We have no idea of MtGox's total liabilities.  Even if we knew the total of user balances, it's not especially helpful without also knowing the rest of their financial information.
We don't know if they borrowed money to shore up their security way back in 2011.  We don't know how they funded the French litigation.  We don't know whether they've borrowed money to cover previous losses.
Revenue isn't a good indicator of financial health when you have no information about the other side of the balance sheet.

Actually, no.  Solvency is the ability to pay ALL your financial commitments as they fall due.
This is yet another guarded statement regarding MtGox.  It doesn't say MtGox has enough funds to cover all customer BALANCES.  It says it has enough money to cover all withdrawal REQUESTS (it's not even accepting new withdrawal requests at the moment).
Nor does the comment speak to the other liabilities of MtGox.  We have no idea what those might be but in order to be solvent MtGox must be able to cover all of those liabilities as well as all user balances.
Forecasts are not audited accounts (and the forecast is based on much higher BTC prices so it's invalid anyway).  
Briefings on a company's operations are not audited accounts.
It's a reassurance based on information provided by MtGox, which is worth about as much as reassurances about Enron.

I'm not an IT person so I don't really know what it would take to fix MtGox's technical issues.
The regulatory issues aren't really something which depend on skills to address.  The answer to dealing with those may mean making tough business decisions to abandon markets where regulatory issues effectively make servicing those markets a liability at the moment.  
My concern would be that user-owners might not support the management decisions which would be necessary to minimise the exchange being adversely affected by regulatory issues.
I think you'd have a hell of a time convincing anyone administering a MtGox insolvency that this is a workable option.

Because if you have proper accounting systems in place it shouldn't be possible to lose large amounts of funds without noticing.  
There should be checks and balances in place to constantly verify that the balances shown in your ledgers match the amounts which are actually in your accounts (both bank accounts and BTC wallets, in this case).
In the 21st century, the discrepancies should have been detected in close to real time.  That they weren't indicates some kind of systemic failure which involves culpability.

What makes you believe either the Skype or ICQ account are actually connected with BTC-e?  
It's devastatingly easy and extremely common for people to set up fake "support" addresses for legitimate businesses.  It's especially easy for people to get taken in by these if the legitimate business doesn't make their actual support addresses highly public and repeatedly advise people to deal only through official support channels.
If you're in contact with a scammer, they aren't going to care if you issue a chargeback.  Like Nigerian scammers, they intentionally target the most gullible of people and they're making money out of the 1% of people who are desperate enough to pay them 2 BTC to "fix the problem".

The vast majority of the Bitcoin community doesn't know anything *factual* about all.  For the most part, their beliefs about him are based on what they've been told by others or are just as speculative as the beliefs of Leah McGrath Goodman - they're not "credible sources" of information.

A decision on whether the company can be restructured is usually made within a month, so you can probably expect the first report to creditors within a few weeks.  These typically say little of any value.
It's likely that any time something new happens in regard to the insolvency it will be posted on the MtGox website.
There doesn't seem to be any specific interval at which reports to creditors must be issued.
You need to realise that while MtGox is a debtor in possession, they're not in control at the moment.  Nothing is going to happen on the insolvency front without the approval of the court.  
It typically takes months just to get a clear picture of the true financial situation of a company when there are large numbers of creditors and international transactions involved.
On the law enforcement front, it will take as long as it takes and there may be no news at all until the investigations are complete.
There's no point in F5ing or expecting daily or weekly updates because it's not how these processes work.

You don't ever really know.  People make a similar mistake when they assume that BTC which have never been moved are still under control of the original owners.  
It's entirely possible to sell your BTC without them being moved to a new address.  Past control of a given address doesn't demonstrate present control and nor does moving coins necessarily demonstrate ownership.
The blockchain isn't a perfect record as it's possible to transfer ownership of BTC outside the blockchain.

None of this addresses the technical and regulatory issues which would need to be addressed for "not MtGox" to operate as a profitable exchange and then some.  
Don't under-estimate the cost of addressing those issues.  not MtGox would face the same issues dealing with conventional financial insitutions that have plagued MtGox - perhaps even greater issues given that MtGox 1 has already caught the attention of regulators on multiple fronts.
Technically, MtGox was already broken.  Fixing its technical deficiencies wouldn't be cheap either.

I'm not aware of any class action in relation to Bitcoinica.  There's the multi-plaintiff Cartmell et al lawsuit and there's the NZ liquidation.
If reports of MtGox intending to file for insolvency in Japan are correct, then lodging claims through that process will be the primary option available to MtGox customers.
Class actions are typically expensive to litigate which is why don't go anywhere if the defendants don't have more than adequate capacity to  offer a settlement prior to any trial.  They're not an effective mean of debt collection (and nor are they intended to be used for that purpose).

You can't rely on a broken English answer because she can't be sure she understood your question or that she answered the question you asked.  
Everyone knew that call centre staff wouldn't be able to do anything about returning funds.  An update to their website was already expected today (they already posted that there'd probably be another update on 3 March).
The "good news" is almost certainly more clarity about how people go about establishing their claims.  It's pretty typical for it to take a week or two after a company begins any insolvency process for this to be organised and communicated to creditors.
Frustrated as people might be by the lack of concrete information, it was never realistic to expect that they were going to get the answers they're seeking from call centre staff.

It's a bit worse than that from the bank's point of view.  Once anything at all flags your account as no longer being low-risk (and this is determined by extremely complex algorithms), they have to apply "enhanced KYC" on an ongoing basis.  
This doesn't simply mean that they can ask you for additional information once and then forget about it, they're obliged to continue monitoring your account more closely on an ongoing basis.  The administrative and economic burden for AML/KYC compliance falls on the bank, so past a certain point it's often more profitable for them to simply dump you as a customer than it is to retain you as a high risk account.

"Legal tender" has a very specific meaning.  A currency can be lawful without being legal tender.

When reddit first started accepting BTC they found that it was costing them more in accounting costs than they were bringing in - this could be a potential issue.  Talk to "conventional" businesses which have accepted BTC as a payment method and find out from them the pros and cons.
You're probably not going to get a reputable charity here in Australia to accept BTC directly at this point, so you need to look at the services which allow people to donate BTC while you receive their donations in AUD.  
If you're "one of the largest" charities here, then I'd look at leveraging your other relationships.  It might be easier to get one of your associated sponsors to accept BTC as a payment method for their products/services and then donate the proceeds to you in AUD.
I'm trying hard to avoid speculating on which charity you work for, but all of them sell products to raise funds.  Accepting BTC for those products might be a better starting point than trying to convince your management committee to accept direct donations in BTC (how would you handle the tax deduction issue for donors, for example?).

Except according to the article, Satoshi has very little to do with his family.  Been separated from his wife for years, hasn't seen the kids for years, and is estranged from the brothers.
The statement doesn't imply that Arthur knows his brother started Bitcoin at all, only that if his brother did start Bitcoin he would deny it.
None of the statements by Dorian's family imply any direct knowledge of him being involved in Bitcoin.  On the contrary, they all sound like responses to a hypothetical scenario put to them by the reporter.  
They're all along the lines of "yeah, he's smart enough to have done that and he wouldn't have told anyone if he did".  There's probably a bit of wishful thinking going on there too.  If a reporter had just told you that your family member was possibly sitting on a fortune, you might want to convince yourself it's true.

It's significant for what it doesn't say.  This has been yet another opportunity for it to be explicitly stated that MtGox has enough funds on hand to cover all user balances or that it's solvent and yet again no such explicit statements have been made.
It refers only to "withdrawal requests" and MtGox stopped taking withdrawal requests.  It's absolutely possible for them to have enough funds on hand to process withdrawal requests which are already in the system without them having enough funds on hand to cover all user balances - the two are not the same.
It's also possible for them to have enough funds on hand to cover all user balances without being solvent - solvency requires the ability to meet ALL financial commitments and we have no idea of the extent of MtGox's other liabilities and especially whether or not they have any secured creditors.

Large withdrawals are already limited by their AML policies.  I suspect the new withdrawal limits will be designed to prevent a mass exodus of smaller account-holders to other exchanges.
New limits are almost certainly going to blow out withdrawal times even further, pretty much keeping the funds of MtGox users hostage until it's convenient for MtGox to return their funds.  
I very much doubt MtGox is nearly as concerned about the impact a massive influx of funds to other exchanges would have on overall Bitcoin price as they are about what a mass exodus of customers would do to their own trading volume.  
Without volume, MtGox is dead in the water.  People have only endured their other problems because they had the volume.  It's in their interests to hold MtGox users hostage as long as they possibly can - there's pretty much no other way they can ensure people will continue to trade on MtGox at all right now other than by making it difficult for people to get their funds out of there.

The 3 million and 6 million yen figures refer to their fiat assets and liabilities only.  They don't include BTC at all.
Right now they're prevented by court order form paying anyone anything.  A decision about whether or not restructuring will proceed should happen within a month but it's not a simple thing given the massive amount of BTC debt and the sheer number of creditors (any proposal to exchange debt for equity requires approval by the creditors).
It's not even clear that a restructured exchange which was essentially owned by creditors would be able to operate.  MtGox was knee deep in legal problems before this and those issues won't just go away. It's profit forecasts certainly weren't great relative to what it's presumed to owe, either.

They deducted the ~80,000 from the total amount owed to customers (in the draft crisis strategy that was ~624,000 BTC) - they didn't ignore it.
Whether they should have listed it separately at all is an accounting issue - it doesn't in any way change the total amount of BTC which are unaccounted for.  It may affect their total liabilities - which is why it's separated out - because the owners of those accounts may have no legal claim to the balances (clean hands and all that).

Can you be a little bit more specific?  Exactly what do you mean when you say "took the coins"?
When the online poker shitstorm blew up, the US government froze a lot of funds but eventually deals were brokered which saw users reimbursed.  The principals were subjected to criminal charges and huge fines were levied against the companies involved.
The major problem here is that even the best lawyers are only going to be guessing about how this will play out.  They'll argue that it should or should not be treated like certain previous cases but ultimately it's courts which will decide whether this is an entirely novel situation or whether there are some precedents which are applicable.

He can't have it both ways.  If he's only about revealing the truth when it's convenient to do so, then he has no more integrity than those he condemns.  Either he publishes and lets the chips fall where they may or he admits that his ethics are entirely situational.

The bank's algorithms will detect anything which is unusual given the information they have about a particular account-holder.  
They know what the usual transaction pattern is for someone of your profession living in your location is, just like the know what the usual transaction pattern is for certain types of businesses in your area.  
Anything significantly outside those patterns is going to be flagged as "suspicious" and in order to avoid potentially massive fines for ignoring it, they're going to investigate that activity.  
They don't care that you're not keeping money in your account.  What they care about is avoiding the fines that ignoring a single suspicious transaction can attract (the fines are in the millions per offence).  They're not worried about losing a tiny amount of profit because you withdraw most of your balance on a regular basis.  They're worried about what your activity could potentially cost them in fines.

This isn't touted by anyone "officially" connected with Bitcoin.  It's touted by factions within the Bitcoin community.  It's just a viewpoint about what Bitcoin "should" be and how it "should" operate and it's no more or less valid than the viewpoints expressed by other factions.

If they knew enough about BTC to be playing the markets, then it's unlikely they didn't know about the risks of leaving your funds with third party services (enough of them have collapsed before) and about the withdrawal problems which have been ongoing and getting worse at MtGox.
In the early days, it used to be difficult to get funds into MtGox quickly so people got into the habit of leaving funds there in case the market moved (seriously, go back to 2011 threads and you'll find lots of complaints about not being able to get funds onto MtGox of a weekend).  
So many different exchanges and other services have collapsed since then, though, that you'd have to live under a rock to be unaware of the risks - not just of hacks or the operators running away with your money, but also of the government coming in and shutting services down and seizing everything.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:03:45
Not really.  It would prove that there's X amount of BTC at a certain address.  A balance alone doesn't mean much - it's pretty easy to use financial smoke and mirrors to make things appear a certain way.  
At the very least you'd want to look at the history of any addresses given to see whether the behaviour is consistent with MtGox having transferred user funds to them and to try to determine whether user funds are quarantined from MtGox/Tibanne funds, the personal BTC addresses of MtGox operators, etc.
Even an independent audit doesn't necessarily guarantee everything is as it appears.  An audit is as good as the information auditors have to work with and how thoroughly they sample (they don't actually verify every single transaction for themselves).

Do you not realise that Bitcoin is literally a century-long project?  Very early adopters tend not to care about Bitcoin as a speculative vehicle - they don't even like the fact it's used as such.  
They keep their Bitcoin for a time when it's in far more widespread use as a currency and/or a future in which the existing financial system has totally broken down.
The very early adopters used to GIVE Bitcoin away to people.  They couldn't have envisaged at the time that Silk Road would come along and thrust it into the public consciousness while it was still an embryo and turn it into a speculation-driven commodity.
Given the high likelihood that BTC randomly given away these days would be sold, I can understand why those who hold large amounts of them no longer randomly give them away - many of them view speculation as a bad thing which is actively harming Bitcoin.

"What if it's not a pseudonym" isn't actually an unreasonable premise for her to have considered.  Many people associated with the very early stages of Bitcoin didn't hide their identities.  
By the time there was "reason" for them to go dark, there were clues to who they really were already out there and so it would have been possible to track them down eventually even if they'd dropped out of sight or manufactured a new identity.
That she entertained the idea of Satoshi being the real world identity of Bitcoin's creator was thinking more outside the box than many others have done - she was questioning whether the assumption it was a pseudonym was even valid.  
Questioning conventional wisdom and asking "what if everything we *know* is wrong" is a hallmark of good investigative journalism.  The problem is what she did after that and how invested she become on bolstering her own theory with flimsy evidence.

The 777 transactions were people trying to chase the funds which were allegedly taken (yet again) from Silk Road.

Nope, the cover sheet explicitly states that it's not a class action and there are no arguments made to establish it as such.

You realise that if Amazon or any other giant wants to get into the Bitcoin game they're going to set up their own BTC processors, don't you?  And then they'll make money out of processing BTC transactions for others as well.
The exchange problem isn't an insurmountable one.  The question is whether the big players will adopt Bitcoin or start from scratch with another crypto-currency when they believe the market is sufficiently mature.
There's nothing stopping some giant from opening an exchange which would absolutely dwarf MtGox and from playing by conventional rules.  No-one's going to question whether an exchange run by an entity the size of PayPal or Amazon has enough funds to cover user balances or the technology to process withdrawals in a timely manner.  I doubt, however, that those businesses are interested in operating a platform for speculation.
While Bitcoin remains so speculation-driven, it's probably going to have limited attractiveness to big business as a payment system.

I'd probably give them a call and ask what that's about, especially as the transaction value was so small.  
A CSR is unlikely to know what occurred in relation to VoS specifically (the process is probably automated anyway), but they might be able to enlighten you on what normally triggers that kind of action.  
Perhaps even more importantly, you need clarification on whether this prohibition applies only to VoS or whether the same thing is likely to happen if you try to transfer funds to another Bitcoin-related service (you might have to escalate from a CSR to find this out but it's a reasonable question which they should be willing to answer if it's a consequence of their own policies).  
You don't want to find your account under review for trying to use another Bitcoin service if they've decided that all transactions involving Bitcoin services are too "high risk" and instituted a blanket ban.

Turnover means nothing if you're spending more each month than you're taking in.
Over the last 12-18 months MtGox has repeatedly been asked to publish audited accounts to prove their solvency.  The concern initially centred on them not having enough cash to cover user deposits - a not unreasonable concern given the ridiculous delays in processing fiat withdrawals which have characterised the service for a very long time.
Over the last couple of years MtGox has on several occasions been embroiled in expensive legal proceedings.  They have almost certainly lost funds due to fraud or theft as well because there's no such thing as perfect security and financial institutions which have invested far more money than MtGox in security routinely lose funds.
Calls for proof of solvency have routinely been met with responses of "it's too difficult/expensive" - a response which encourages cynicism given that even relatively small businesses generally have their accounts audited on a regular basis.
People are right to be skeptical regarding the true financial state of MtGox.  The business has been plagued by chronic problems for so long now that nobody should be surprised if it is suddenly shut down, either voluntarily or at the instigation of regulators.  
Leaving funds on MtGox these days makes about as much sense as leaving funds on the darknet markets, but people will inevitably continue to do so because greed over-rides commonsense.

People who believe in Bitcoin as a subversive technology wouldn't be using a registered company with known principals in the first place.  They'll be trading under the radar.
It stands to reason that those who choose to use a business which keeps extensive transaction records and which verifies the identities of its customers are more likely to be those who are more in favour of regulation and oversight of the Bitcoin businesses with which they deal.
The is no single, cohesive "Bitcoin agenda".  People use it for different reasons and want different things from it.  Some of the "agendas" within the Bitcoin community are in direct conflict with others.  
Different services spring up to service the differing factions within the Bitcoin community.  There are plenty of people who want more regulation of Bitcoin services because they believe that "big money" won't enter Bitcoin until it's more regulated and they believe that "big money" entering Bitcoin will benefit them financially.

She had a deadline approaching and only flimsy evidence.  
She admits herself in the article that what she had wasn't conclusive and that she could only get "conclusive" evidence by talking to Dorian face to face.  
What she had was suggestive, but insufficient.  A news story is not a legal argument so she could pretty much set her own bar for the standard of "evidence" required to support her assertion.  With time running out, she set that bar very low - at plausibility.
She basically tried to make the "facts" fit her pet theory in time to meet her deadline.  Even law enforcement can develop tunnel vision in this respect but they're not not on a deadline and the standard of evidence required to establish their theories as fact is much higher (and ultimately it is others who determine whether the evidence is fact, not those who collect and present the evidence).

If they were offered in a single lot at auction then you'd have a very limited amount of potential buyers who'd no doubt bid very low, but any impact on the price would be very brief.  
If they break it up into several lots, then there's a good chance that people are going to bid the price up to a few dollars under market price - which really won't have a lot of impact on the price for very long.

**Dear Friends, Lovers, and Enemies,
First off. Sorry for the scare. and believe me it was a SCARE - we had to refund over 200k and we were happy to do it because we claimed from day one that we will honor any refurequest until we go into production and we meant it. And As crazy as fuck as it is to say so , we will sill honor it. We took multiple 20k+ refunds left and right without batting and eye lash because we believe in this project and we know we will be releasing our bASIC Bitcoin mining units sooner than everyone else, especially our good friends BFL.
Love us or hate us, I have some good friends who are original Bitcoin "old money" and they gave us the additional funding we need to finish the chip fab / packaging and take this thing into production. (THANK GOD!)
we WILL be shipping bASIC bitcoin mining devices in March 2013 and I am willing to put my own money against anyone who says otherwise.
The Design is done baby. The chips will be state-side as soon as Chinese New Year is over and for those who could not stomach the wait I don't blame you but I'm sorry to say you lost you place in line my friends. 
March may seem a long time away as we all have ASIC blue balls right now, but its really not that far away, and I salute and congratulate all of you who have had the testicular fortitude to stick it out with us because you my friends will receive the ultimate reward. Sure Avalon may get some units out before the Chinese new year but that is sure to be a very limited number. On the other hand our assembly house has an unlimited assembly capacity and as soon as the Chinese new year ends we will have 16,000 freshly fabbed and packaged ASIC chips and we will be assembling those PCB's at FULL CAPACITY !We will be shipping ALL CURRENT ORDERS IN THE MONTH OF MARCH AND WE STILL HAVE ROOM FOR MORE ORDERS SO Get IN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I stake my personal name and word on that. So hold on tight my friends because its going to be a wild ride in the month of March. 
Now Let's Get ready to mine some serious coins

What else can they really say?
If you want high profile "mainstream" people to endorse Bitcoin, you have to accept that there's a trade-off.  
If they keep quiet about their 11 million dollars worth of Bitcoin holdings and their investment in BitInstant, then Bitcoin doesn't get the confidence boost which comes from attracting high profile investors.
If they're public about their Bitcoin investments, then those investments are subject to regulatory scrutiny.  They're investing to make money and they're going to mitigate what risks they can.  
You can't publicly state that you hold 11 million dollars in Bitcoin and then leave that investment off your financial statements come tax time.  
You're not going to publicly state that you've led a funding round for a money service business and then risk losing your investment due to financial services regulation compliance issues.
Right now the investments being made into Bitcoin and Bitcoin services are still very small (from memory, 11 million is the largest publicly declared holding and 5 million is the largest publicly announced funding round).  You're simply not going to get Pinterest or Square levels of investment (100 million plus) into businesses which aren't regulation compliant and Bitcoin services can't seriously compete with conventional services without that level of funding.

It wouldn't matter a damn to the ATO.  The ATO will treat something "as if".  
If you're using something as a currency (and if you're accepting it as payment then you're using it as a currency rather than a stock or commodity), then they'll just treat it as normal business income in the first instance and apply the same rules they'd apply if you were accepting a foreign currency.  
They don't care whether you convert on a daily basis or once a month, but they require that you use a consistent method for determining value so you can't just wait until it's at it's lowest point.  People using PayPal to accept payments in foreign currencies deal with this all the time and the ATO wrapped their head around it long ago.
Where there's any doubt about how to treat something, you ask the ATO for an individual ruling.  This applies only to your particular situation for the period in question but it protects you from any blow back in respect of questions which don't have a clear answer because they're a new situation and it removes the risk associated with your tax agent taking a guess at how to declare shit (if your tax agent gets it wrong, you're liable).

As the actual charge related to the murder for hire is a conspiracy charge (he's only been charged in relation to trying to have the former employee killed), it's not necessary for anyone to have been harmed in order for it to stick.  They just need to prove that he tried to have someone killed and paid for having that person killed after receiving "confirmation" that it had been done - they have ample evidence of that.

OK, I'll play.
An insurance company which agrees to this will put in place all sorts of requirements, not the least of which will be compliance with all kinds of security standards which apply to conventional financial institutions.  
Even if you can avoid the need to meet capital requirements, you are looking at spending millions of dollars on physical and non-physical security.  I've worked for a financial services provider in a secure facility and the complexity and cost of the technology used to protect financial data is staggering.
While data centres exist where you can rent this kind of physical security, your staff can't work out of them - and the security measures  you need to put in place in terms of your staff are part of the whole insurance deal.
Right now, the initial outlay necessary to offer this hypothetical service would likely mean it wouldn't show a profit for a long time.  
There's a demand, but it might not be great enough to make offering such a service profitable by the time you factor in the initial investment in infrastructure and the cost of insurance. Natural disaster, acts of war (or anything else which vaguely qualifies as force majeure) etc are often specifically excluded from coverage in standard insurance contracts - if you want those covered, expect even higher premiums.

The first hit - the $80k one against a former employee - definitely known to be fake.  The "hitman" was a federal agent, as outlined in the Maryland grand jury indictment.
It looks like agents only became aware of his second attempt to have someone killed - in response to the alleged extortion attempt - when they gained access to his messages after they imaged the server.  
The NY sworn complaint mentions them checking with Canadian authorities whether there'd been any homicides reported at the time and in the area when that hit was supposed to have taken place - suggesting that they didn't know whether he was dealing with a scammer who just took his money for nothing and sent him photos of a staged scene (as agents themselves did earlier in the year) or even another agency running a sting of which they weren't aware.
The NY complaint doesn't make any conclusions about who DPR may have been dealing with when he tried to take out a hit on "FriendlyChemist", it only notes that Canadian authorities had no record of a resident with the name of the target given to redandwhite and no record of homicides in the area where FriendlyChemist supposedly lived around the time the hit was supposed to have taken place.

It might have been a good way to test the ASIC waters last year when BFL thought they'd have a fairly long lead time before anyone else delivered, but given the amount of hashing power which is going to come online in the next month or two, a 4.5 GH unit is going to be a bit of a stillborn child and more of a gimmick than anything else.

Do any of you have any previous experience in the insurance industry or in financial risk management?  While some kind of insurance is definitely a service desired by many users, it's not something which can be operated without significant resources given the rate at which Bitcoin services fail.
I'm interested in hearing more about your criteria for rating businesses as "legit" and "honest" given that the majority of Bitcoin businesses which have failed to date have been regarded as honest by the community and it could be argued that incompetence rather than frank dishonesty has been the cause of their failure.
Also, it's pretty much impossible to assess the risk of a particular Bitcoin business failing (and such risk assessments are critical to your success) due to adverse events such as fraud or security breaches without access to their financial data.

ASICMiner will be bringing a total of 62 TH online that we know of.  BFL has 11,000 chips which can do a minimum of 7.5 GH each, and that's not taking into account their bulk order of 63,000 chips.  Avalon has sold 900 units so far, each of which does over 60 GH.
People who order from BFL now likely won't get their units until May-June.  "Doubling" isn't a fair estimation, really - the network hashrate should have increased a lot more than that by then, irrespective of any further delays in BFL delivering their first units.

Honestly, people have been warned against using the exchanges like banks and leaving large amounts of funds on them for a very long time - even by MtGox themselves.  
Regardless of which exchange you use, the best way to mitigate the risk of your funds being frozen is to move everything you don't immediately need for trading off the exchanges.  
If CoinLab gets their shit together, then moving funds in and out should be much quicker.  One reason people tended to leave funds on the exchanges in the past was because it could take so long to move funds into their exchange accounts.  We now have more services to facilitate that.
Exchange accounts with conventional financial institutions are inherently vulnerable - that's a risk you accept when you leave funds on an exchange.

Jurisdiction is stated in the contract as Washington State.  It's not going to be thrown out on jurisdiction.
From a lawyer on BCT.
"I guarantee the drafting attorney meant to write in Paragraph 3: "This is an action for damages in excess of $75,000.00 excluding interest, attorneys’ fees and costs."
Instead the complaint says "$75,000,000.00".
The federal diversity statute 28 U.S.C. § 1332 requires the complaint to be in excess of $75,000.  I have never seen any federal complaint when any number other than $75,000 is written in this paragraph.
So the $75 million number that is being thrown around is quite simply wrong.  
I'll continue reading the complaint now.  That's as far as I got before I noticed that.  
Edit:  In fact, there is a liquidated damages provision in this contract.  So the MOST under any circumstances they could get would be $50 million.  I'll have to lookup WA state common law on liquidated damages though to determine how the court will analyze this provision."

You said the details of the contract weren't known.  I posted a link so you can read those details.
My personal viewpoint is that where people have a viable lawsuit, it's ridiculous to expect them to put "the good of Bitcoin" before the financial interests of their companies.
I believe that if you're going to ask Vessenes to stand down from the Foundation then Mark should be asked to stand down too.

Take your meds?
Seriously, someone wanting to manipulate price has convinced courts to issue arrest warrants and a protection order (to seize the domain, the servers, and all of the wallets on the SR servers) AND also convinced SR staff to pretend they're unable to access the servers?
Not only that, they've managed to arrange at least two SR vendors (one of them in the UK) being arrested at the same time Ross Ulbricht was taken down?
Anyone who can deploy those kind of resources would find the amount of profit to be made during a temporary dip in the market trivial.

Tell that to the Oregon vendors who are being charged for every single sale they made on SR as well as money laundering.
Law enforcement has openly stated that their investigation into SR is ongoing.  It's ridiculous to assume that because people haven't been charged yet they won't be in the future - people made exactly that argument regarding the SR mods/admins not being charged when Ulbricht was and look how that turned out.
It's just not possible to know where the prosecutions will stop.  Even if US authorities aren't interested in prosecuting smaller vendors/users, this information is being shared with international law enforcement agencies and there's no guarantee where those international agencies will draw the line with their own nationals.

A lot of financial services in foreign countries no longer accept accounts from US citizens because the requirement that they report those accounts to the IRS or with-hold tax on behalf of the IRS is being implemented.  Both Japan the the UK are implementing this agreement and other FATF countries will likely follow.
You don't really have to ban the transactions outright.  You just need to make the administrative burden so high and so costly that companies will choose not to let US citizens use their services (which has already happened with the trading arms of some foreign banks and many forex services).  
A lot of these measures affect Bitcoin but they weren't specifically designed with Bitcoin services in mind (many were proposed years ago and are only now being implemented).

Assuming it ever got to the point of domesticating a judgement, wouldn't the court be able to order MtGox to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings and/or sell its IP (including the Bitcoin trademark it holds in the UK) to satisfy the judgement?
Isn't MtGox going to have to provide financial statements at some point during these proceedings, including information which identifies their hot and cold wallets along with their bank accounts?  They've repeatedly maintained that they comply with Japanese financial services laws, so I'd expect their audited accounts to include their BTC holdings.
This isn't the first legal rodeo for some of CoinLab's investors.  Chances are that what they're really aiming for is settlement on undisclosed terms or possibly having the agreement set aside because they've realised it's not as favourable for them as they anticipated.

It's not a tough question to answer at all.  If you're not willing to disclose your real life identity and your past experience in the insurance sector, then you could at least disclose your known user identities in the Bitcoin community so that people have some idea who they're dealing with.  If you don't do that, you could be pirate for all any of us know or someone who has a history of failed Bitcoin ventures.  An idea is only as good as the competence of the person executing it.
The onus isn't on us to blindly trust you, it's on you to establish your bonafides.  You need to convince us not only that you're a trustworthy person in general but that you're also competent to run the venture you're establishing.

Apart from the "fuck, gummint" argument (which does have some merit if you're in the US and weren't planning on reporting your Bitcoin earnings to the IRS), I'm seeing a few people concerned about the prospect of large players entering the market.
People want the best of both worlds.  They want Bitcoin price to skyrocket - which will only happen on a sustained basis is serious money  enters the market - but they don't want small speculators to be at the mercy of large traders.
It's kind of like the resentment over GPU miners effectively being squeezed out of mining by ASICs.

AML/CFT compliance is a huge administrative burden.  Financial service providers are forced to err on the side of caution because the potential penalties for non-compliance are staggering.  
Transactions which are flagged as "suspicious" have to be personally reviewed by a compliance officer.  A lot of transactions are going to have some element which makes them flag as suspicious.  If you set your software to reduce false positives, you risk not reporting genuinely suspicious transactions.
"Anything suspect" encompasses a mind-boggling list of things.
Massive financial institutions can afford to take the hit if they get it wrong.  There's almost certainly no Bitcoin enterprise currently operating which wouldn't be destroyed by tens of millions of dollars in fines.

It's also unfortunate that Bitcoinica has now been in liquidation for 6 months and MtGox has not provided the liquidator with information requested regarding the MtGox Bitcoinica account.

Despite what he's said elsewhere, he's admitted in IRC that the backdoors he was told about on here could have been used in this attack.  Don't take him at his word when he says that he's the one who found the exploit.

Feds mightn't have missed that.  The warrant states that they haven't included everything they have, just enough to establish probable cause.

I think that's just badly worded.  From everything which was said at the time, MtGox would not be serving US or Canadian customers directly after the transition date - those customers would access MtGox through CoinLab.
In fact MtGox was asked what would happen to customers who didn't want to make the transition to CoinLab and said that the only way they could continue using MtGox after the transition was by accepting the CoinLab ToS (this was in contradiction to what the CoinLab website said - which was that customers would be automatically migrated without having to do anything) - that staying with MtGox Japan would not be an option for US/Canadian customers.

Also, exactly who are "we" and why should people trust you with their insurance premiums?
You can't function as an organisation vouching for the credibility of others unless you can first establish your own credibility and it's crazy to believe that you can do that while remaining anonymous.

One of the strangest things about this is Roger Ver saying he knew nothing about the lawsuit until he read about it on Bitcointalk.  
Given the implications for CoinLab and its investors if MtGox prevails, this seems a little strange.

Roger clarified this on Bitcointalk.  They need to sell about $850,000 per quarter.  With a month left to go in the quarter, they've sold about $50,000 worth of products so they need to sell $800,000 this month to keep their discounts from their suppliers.
And yeah, the title of the article is extremely mis-leading and bullshit hype like that doesn't really do anything to promote Bitcoin in a positive way.

Read the complaint.  A former employee of SR was arrested at the beginning of the year and DPR tried to organise a "clean hit" on that person (that's the $80k hit he talks about having organised previously).  
The person who accepted that first "hit" was a federal agent and they sent him photographic "evidence" that it had been carried out.  So he already felt a sense of security about being able to organise getting rid of someone by arranging stuff online - he thought he'd already done it before.
He was already paranoid before the FriendlyChemist stuff happened, which probably made him even more likely to fall for it and to panic in response to it.
They had him on the murder for hire thing long before they obtained the server image.

Amir doesn't speak in any official capacity and no-one can stop him from making public statements about Bitcoin or giving interviews.  
All you can really do is make sure that there are plenty of people the media can contact for comments regarding Bitcoin and be pro-active about establishing relationships with the media.
Like it or not, crypto-anarchists are part of the Bitcoin community and they feel they have something to contribute to the public dialogue.  If you don't like the way one person represents their interests, then perhaps other people with the same viewpoints need to be encouraged to join the public discussion.
I agree that Amir does not interview well - he often comes across as not entirely present and quite distracted (the interview during which he was answering phone calls was cringe-worthy) - but I'm not so sure that reflects on Bitcoin itself rather than on crypto-anarchists.

Bitcoin wasn't designed to be a blue chip stock or commodity.  Speculation is ALWAYS risky and it's always sound advice to not risk more than you're willing to lose on speculation (which is essentially gambling, regardless of how well-informed those gambling are).  That people promote BTC as an investment and use the language of the investment world when discussing it doesn't mean that "investing" directly in Bitcoin isn't pure speculation.
Bitcoin has additional layers of risk involved which make the "don't invest more than you're willing to lose" advice even more relevant.  Even if the price is relatively stable, the risk of losing funds in other ways is ever present - from outright scams to service providers being hacked/business models failing, there are plenty of instances where people are risking losing 100% of their BTC and not just half the value.
It's hard to feel sympathy for those who sink their "life savings" or college funds into BTC in the hope of getting rich quick.  I'm inclined to believe that if BTC didn't exist, they'd gamble that money on some other high risk "investment" anyway.

Isn't this what GPU MAx did?
At least it means that people whose hardware will be useless for mining when ASICs hit in force will still be able to use those machines to generate income.

Judging by the amount of "ZOMG where am I going to get my drugs now" posts on the onion forums whenever something goes wrong with one of the marketplaces, I suspect that even if the non-addict users are the majority, they're not the most profitable.

I guess it depends what you consider "the long run".  It's probably not going to be significant by the end of the year, and that's just with the extra hashing power that's already scheduled to come online.  If other vendors enter the market, 30 GH could become insignificant much sooner.

In simple terms, MtGox won't have any direct contact with the funds of US and Canadian customers any more.
It's thought that one of the reasons driving this decision on their part is the imposition of new requirements on foreign banks and financial institutions to report the financial activity of US citizens to the IRS.  
Japan has agreed to implement these measures, so MtGox serving US customers would likely lead to issues with their own banks as well as more delays and more stringent requirements in processing transactions for US customers.
The administrative burden these new measures will impose on foreign institutions basically makes accepting small investments from US citizens a pain in the ass.
