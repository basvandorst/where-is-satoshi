As someone who has a hardware wallet, and haven't tried to restore it, I now see that I've been unwise. Is there any way to check that my words are correct w/o risking to get locked out? :) Or can I try to recover it with my coins on the device, using the words and if they are incorrect still acces it via my pin?

Got in at 4100$, everyone laughted when I said by the end of the year Bitcoin could possibly reach 10.000$ or more.. The same people wrote to me today saying bitcoin is dying at 14.000$ the 22nd of December..

Swedish computer and electronics store Inet \([  Recently started selling goods through BitPay. When/if bitcoin has another spike I just might buy a new computer :\) One of the first and one of the biggest stores in Sweden I know of that accepts bitcoin!

Ofc not, but how can I store money digitally without banks, bitcoin or other crypto?

I havn't seen cash in years, never in my life seen or used a check, not even sure I could get my salary paid in cash, especially w/o the use of a bank (ofc i might be wrong) liquidating stocks takes time if I am not misstaken and I am pretty sure they cant be used for microtransactions, pay bills etc.. I personally don't see how I could live the life I currently live (In Sweden, using Swish or microtransacting on the web pretty much once a day w/o the use of some type of bank in this current state) For long time saving, sure stocks could be something, but for your monthly/daily use of money I dont really see another way atm, except if bitcoin was massadopted.
I am pretty sure some stores in Sweden don't even accept cash.

Sadly didnt save the questions, but your'e basically asked if you, or any of your family members are involved in politics, separated in to one question about you and one about family. Your income, where it comes from and how much per month , if yuo have savings over 250 000 SEK and where that money comes from etc. Acces is denied until questions are answered.

Thanks for the tip, bought 50$ worth of bitcoin yesterday, just to start learning wallets and how it all works.. The fee of buying was enormous tho, is that a fixed fee or is it a %? bought from Bitcoin.com and for the 50$ of bitcoin they charged me 61$..

Thanks for telling me your story :)

Update: ended up buying myself up to currently 2 BTC, bought daily for 300 usd from blockchain.info, some from localbitcoin.com..
Currently about 33% portfolio invested in bitcoin and at 4000$ profit IF i were to sell at this point buy I am looking to stay invested for long term, 1 btc for a few years and the other for way longer just to see where it goes.
Also invested in a TREZOR.
HODLing on, to the mooon! :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:41:14
New to the hodling community, my second dip thus far (the first beeing the drop from about 5500 to 3000) I've bought in portions during the last 2-3 months. My avrage price is somewhere around 4000$ so even during the low of this dip I was up about 1500$/BTC. Stay strong and hodl those coins for 2021! :)

lol, Isold all my csgo skins to buy 2 btc too.. strange times (22)
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:07:35
Well, I bought all those skins 2 years ago for less than I sold it for today tho :D
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:51:08
The future indeed, and there will be halving in bitcoins produced from mining in around june 2020, which should, during the following months cause an aditional rise in price, since there will be less and less bitcoins produced. (Speculations by a fairly new HODLER)

Bought my coins from Blockchain.info, later bought a TREZOR and transferred them there. Are my coins possibly fake? do I need to learn more about what a full node is, and how to run it? What can happen if I do not?
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:28:50
ELI5: What exactly does one do when "running a full node" I haven't came to an understanding of what it actually is, and what one needs to do etc..

As someone who has btc on a trezor and on 1-2 exchanges, how do I go about using LN? I haven't yet tried it and I am not sure how to..

As a scandinavian I've never heard of this. On top of that I know a lot of places accepting only card payments or swish. ��
