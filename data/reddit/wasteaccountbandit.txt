I'd recommend hedging with alt-coins to get a larger long term return, since every alt-coin goes up whenever bit-coin goes up, if you're in this for the long term and see how this type of technology can change our world for the better. If I could go back in time then redo some of my previous investments I probably would have waited until bit-coin dropped to buy in then go into promising crypto 2.0 coins rather than just random alt-coins. Overall though, do your research on coins, make sure they have a unique technology and good community, then check out but remember to take a break every now and then while not investing more than you can afford to loose in order to remain sane.

Decentralized Markets similar to Open Bazaar could probably be combined with something like Lazooz and Automated drones/vehicles in order to build decentralized delivery systems owned by no one but everyone in the not too distant future.

The price per coin should steadily increase as more people use bitcoin, distribute it, get paid in it, then build services on top of the protocol since the currency will only be successful if everyone spends it every day and doesn't just *hodl* especially since holding makes everything less decentralized.
