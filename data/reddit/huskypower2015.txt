Ouch. Well...pretty shitty. Gives the bitcoin community a bad name as well.
Are his operations vulnerable to cyber-attacks or is he pretty armed?
"Does the thief report the thief of his own good to the authorities?"
Comes to mind?

Unfortunately, anything that could be held as collateral would be my wallet. 
So, you lend me coins from your wallet to me, you get access to my wallet. 
Since you have your funds on my wallet, really, it is just your wallet...just a new address.
That is what is bothering me as well. You see people make loans with no collateral, but trust.
I guess that is what could be held as collateral trust. Since bitcoin is held somewhat under trust.

They want personal info though?

True, but how will proving that you have driver's license and a home address make anything better? 
Think about it: are you going to send Thumper and Bumper to visit the debtor if they don't cough up the dough?
Banks have it right: You want money? Give us something of equal value like a car, house, or business and its assets. 
A bank doesn't care what you have...they want their money back and that is it.
My issue with bitcoin lending service is the invasive practice of selling your personal self online to get, what? Bitcoins? 
I care about my public appearance. I do not want to come of as a scammer or cheat. If I do lie and cheat people out of their coins, I just killed the goose that laid the golden egg. I want to create a network of trust with the community. Giving my personal information online does nothing but prove that I will give anything valuable away to sell myself for cheap. It's wrong and disgusting.

Right, so...why not return the favour?
@_date: 2015-05-10 06:31:04
True. Then, there is no point getting any loans then.
@_date: 2015-05-10 03:12:08
Hmmm...you make a good point!

Again, they want personal info.
