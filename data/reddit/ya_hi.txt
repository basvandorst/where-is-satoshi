why isn't the price dropping (more)? I don't understand anything anymore...

So as a plan B the twins can have their own OTC, and effectively be like an ETF but without the "seal of quality" from the SEC?

I spent a total of 30 seconds reading about this guy but it seems like a criminal was asked to step down. It's surprising he lasted this long in the first place?

Your forgot to tell us the word

It's still funny not knowing Russian

Nice try James

It's not obvious, but the total market cap is currently $33.88B and last week it was around $29B
@_date: 2017-04-28 21:06:12
You are absolutely right! It takes significantly less to move the market $4B. Although the fear remains, why did all the new buyers avoid bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:20:14
I still have my original bitcoin(s) and I'm finding it hard to hold on. $4B just came into crypto this week and very deliberately avoided bitcoin. Less than 7% came in, considering how bitcoin is needed to buy most cryptos that's pretty scary.

Oh, I didn't know. I just saw a solution to my 2-day back logged transaction and they helped me. Whoops
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:03:24
Yup, buy bitcoin because it will be pegged. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:49:58
Would it be fair to say your answer is the network effect of bitcoin is the biggest strength? Alternatively, if that network effect were to be taken away, what would happen?
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:18:40
Sorry I'm old school, I remember the community believing we'd bring self banking to those in Africa who can't afford to send money.  TBH I have avoided bitcoin for a while. What would you say is the one job of bitcoin right now?  
edit: back in my day, one of the strengths of bitcoin was to replace western union

You can try to speed it up here: 
These generous miners take pity on the low fee transactions and try to push them through.

ITT: Security, although it's centralized and bitcoin relies on hope to the 5 miner gods
Network effect / popularity

Bitcoin, you had one job!!!
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:47:52
Isn't the security centralized? I remember a panel showing 5 people representing 80% of bitcoin mining.
edit: although litecoin is also centralized in the same way, as seen from the first segwit attempt
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:08:50
I don't expect anything. I'm asking if there is some sort of consensus on what bitcoin is great at and it looks like the answer is unclear.

9% markup is kind of steep :(
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:34:17
What if I told you bitcoin has reversed transactions before (although very obviously a bug exploit, just like ethereums very obvious theft)?
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:24:19
Hope is not a valid security strategy
