the vendors on SilkRoad, I'm sure must be converting their coins to Fiat. No serious vendor, who is making a living off silkroad is going to keep all their earnings in coins. Mortgage needs to be paid, car notes, insurance, etc, all of which currently can't be paid with bitcoins. So those guys must at some point be converting to fiat.
Local bitcoins, well, that works for 'small' one on one transactions, but for any serious business this isn't really an option. Not to mention all the huge risks that could come with this is Govt. and banks decided to REALLY crack down on Bitcoins.
All in all, as it stands right now and for the short to medium term, it appears to me as if the success of bitcoin is still very closely linked to Fiat and how easy/hard it is to convert to fiat.

This works for relatively small transactions... but, can you imagine a company that does say a million in business every two days, cashing out that money 'over a beer'?

I'm curious, how did you determine what the value was of the coins you accepted for payment? Prices seem so volatile I'm sure you wanted to protect yourself against devaluation.

I've been thinking about what would happen if institutions collectively banned the transfer of fiat to and from bitcoin. On the surface this doesn't seem that hard to do.
Would the value of bitcoin drop to 0 because merchants (of legal and illegal goods) couldn't convert bitcoins to fiat? If as a merchant I sell 100K USD worth of goods (which I bought with USD) and collected bitcoin as payment, if I can't convert these bitcoins to USD it presents several problems. So the incentive for merchants to collect bitcoins as payments seems like it would pretty much disappear.
