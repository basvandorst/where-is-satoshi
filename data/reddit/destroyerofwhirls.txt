Yes, that's what Buffet tells the rubes, yet he seemed perfectly willing to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs, and the way they earn the vast majority of their profits is much more complicated than bitcoins.

yes, but if there are more buyers than sellers, the buyers have to offer a better price to compete with the other buyers.
IF there are more sellers than buyers, the reverse is true.
(This is a very basic explanation of the economics of any market)

I agree.  Warren Buffet is as corrupt as the rest of them.  However, I guarantee he doesn't understand all the specialized computer trading systems.   He definitely knows that Goldman has taken over the government though.

You were not using the term fiat money 'less literally', you were using it incorrectly.  :)

You seem to be confused about the definition of fiat money. Fiat money is when a paper or script is ruled by a government *fiat* to be worth a certain value.
Fiat money does not simply mean money that doesn't have any tangible backing.
The mining part definitely is strange, but it's a way to get a large group of separate people to maintain a massive, powerful network.   This massive network is what is able to verify the transactions so quickly that it is virtually impossible for another network to overtake it.  The way the math is designed, transactions are easy to verify, and hard to create.  
This makes it virtually impossible for a fake transaction to ever be accepted, as the bitcoin network is essentially racing as fast as it can to create new blocks (which in a way are records of past transactions).
Really you should read the white paper, it's really interesting.

Why are you playing these games?  When a government declares BTC legal tender, then you can call it fiat money.
Until then, you are simply wrong, and I'm not going to waste any more time on your nonsense.  This is a basic, Econ 101 definition.

You can disagree all you want, but 'fiat' is a government declaration.  Fiat money is thus money backed only by government declaration making it a legal tender currency.
There is nothing to argue about.
Your statement about a 'physical group' and 'non-physical group' is nonsense.  It doesn't mean anything.

Money, like any other tangible commodity, is worth exactly what someone will give you for it.
