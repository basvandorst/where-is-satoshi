@_date: 2017-12-20 20:29:47
$16 to send .00000001 BTC is a joke!
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:37:33
Multisig will be so confusing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:43:30

@_date: 2017-12-20 20:26:51
I didn't get the message but they mine been pending for over a week and no response.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:27:58
over a week here.. I think everyone is on vacation.   support automated system is also on vacation i think.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:32:39
Now that it been hitting hard on regular news.. some people are interested in it.
I tell them I can help them get it but everyone said it cost too much now.  Everyone want to buy the WHOLE BTC. not .055465 stake. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:27:19
just got email that I'm verified.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:30:59
I have 2 @ 450 and .5 @ 330.
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:48:37
Coinbase tell me instant buy is enabled for my account but it doesn't tell me how much I can buy instantly, after I made the purchase, 4-5 days, now it show up that I can buy $100 worth instantly. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:24:14
Man, I bought 1 at 330 and I guess still no good.   I got 2 @ 450 :(
If I sell to stop loss it will probably jump back up to crazy prices.  
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:33:20
I doubled my investment at $8 bucks!!
@_date: 2014-07-27 01:41:52
Because I bought some when it was 600+ 3 days ago!
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:28:07
I bought @ 330 thought that was going to be the bottom.   I just gonna wait.. soon as I sell it gonna turn around. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:43:33
nahh, its because I bought .25btc on Friday.  I can't even imagine if I have bought more..
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:22:28
Still don't want American Money though?  After all that verifications :(
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:29:48
I like BTC-E  If you trust Russian base Money Order service you can buy BTC easily and very cheap.  No verification, nothing needed.  
I bought BTC with American Credit card before using one of their Russian based money order type service.  
You just put in credit card number. prepaid OK and 2 days later USD deposited.  
No verification bullshits, just signed up and you're ready to deposit and start trading.

Hydro Electrnic in state doesn't mean much.. I live near a hydro electric plant and my power came from coal plant somewhere else. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:32:13
Looking at the options to get crypto, compare to option we have in USA. I wish I'm in Russia.
 
@_date: 2016-10-25 02:20:06

@_date: 2015-02-08 04:29:26
I have my sell order set around there.  just incase I'm not paying attention and blew up! 
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:04:16
so. I should stop selling coins directly from Coinbase to friends? 
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:53:51
I got some coins stolen from lack of 2fa on my part.  It sat in scumb's wallet for like a year before they moved into small bits.
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:07:59
They should.. I buy coins for people using my coinbase account.. now i'm worry.  I don't know how they spend their coins!
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:44:20
you might want to split the amount into different address also.   Still track if they want to but will make it little harder.
How do they know where your BTC is going.. How do they know where the address get generated? 
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:29:24
the SMS come from random phone numbers. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 05:25:34

@_date: 2015-02-13 21:28:28

@_date: 2015-02-13 21:34:57

@_date: 2015-02-20 23:55:10

@_date: 2013-04-12 23:34:28
Every new web stores take paypal for like a month and they quit and moved on to Credit Card service because Paypal really sucks for sellers. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:18:43
That what happen to me. I have about $100 worth of BTC and I wanted to buy something form place that take BTC within the hour I only have $90 worth of BTC and not able to buy what I want.
Also price hasn't come back up to yet :(
Tired of watching the chart just want to get rid of it by buying something I want. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:06:05
what if part of your coin form Pool A went to known illegitimate outfit?  
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:22:42
They should also use PGP for additional security.. Code are send encrypted with your public key.. you must decrypt to get the code.  Just in case hacker is too good and already hacked into your phone account and swap the phones out.   And also got access to your email already. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:16:30
nahh.. Its all my fault.  I was playing around with MtGox interface and accidentally bought $100 worth of bitcoins @ 155 last week.
As soon as that happen.  It just keep sliding!
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:13:53
A lot of places used to take paypal stop taking paypal.  I used to just like using paypal because I don't have to type all the CC numbers in.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:57:25
Even after vfy at Dwolla it still takes like 3 to 4 days to make it into digital :(
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:04:44

@_date: 2013-04-12 23:31:52
Paypal is nice if you're on paying end.  it suck when you're on receiving end. 
Sold something on a forum and money was frozen for weeks because I used my own shipping.  They also rape you with fee. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:55:16
