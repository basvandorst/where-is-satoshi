The reason double spend isn't common is because the vast majority of people are not retarded like you who just accept 0 confirmation and give out the good/service to the counterparty.
It's very similar to the concept of group immunity. You are just taking advantage of it, and you are too stupid to even realize that. lol...
You are a fucking joke. Fucking nerd who doesn't know the real world.

thanks for the reply. what do you mean that they said they had a "random" processing system? Do you mean they randomize the processing time on purpose? As a anti-fraud protection or something?! But confirmed bitcoin payment is ZERO risk to them, so I don't get it at all.

Can you kindly tell me your local bitcoins ID? I will glad make trades with you, at very attractive rates. Now I just need to figure out how to double spend..... :P

UPDATE: After waiting 16 hours and sending an inquiry to their support, I finally got the gift card.
What a fucking joke. Having to wait for pretty much a full day to get gift card AFTER the bitcoin payment was already confirmed.
It doesn't even make any business sense. Confirmed btc payment is ZERO risk, no chargeback no stolen credit card possible (as it would be, in the case of Paypal &amp; credit card payments). So WTF are they thinking? 
It used to be you get your card as soon as 1 confirmation, then about 3 weeks ago you get your card 4-5 HOURS after confirmed, and now, fucking 16 hours after confirmation?!
And what if I didn't send inquiry to the support? It was gonna take forever?
I no longer use egifter, that's for sure. Just bought several hundreds worth of gift cards from Gyft. They give you card as soon as one confirmation.
