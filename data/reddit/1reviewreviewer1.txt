Could you explain in a little more detail what sweeping the keys is and how it works?
I apologize for my ELI5 mentality

Man talk about generosity! 
Post your BTC address if you can, I'd feel much better if I could toss some coin your way, since I was going to offer some to OP, you absolutely deserve an equal gratitude!

I am equally interested in this. Yubikey can be used with online BTC wallets like blockchain.info, but as far as the BitcoinQT desktop wallet, I'm not sure if it's been done yet

What else would you sell BTC for?

Really good work man!
Going to keep an eye on this, and I would absolutely buy 3 or 4 packs, especially at your estimated price point, as gifts to people I'm trying to get into BTC!

Would you recommend having a checking account specifically for these transactions? If I recall correctly, there were numerous stories online of people having their bank account closed due to association with BTC. Has that problem eased up since then, or is that still a very real issue?

Oh indeed, though I'm not selling BTC **instead** of holding them. I'm doing both. Currently I can buy as many BTC as I want with a click of the mouse instantly. If people that don't have the ease of purchasing BTC like I do are willing to pay a % markup for them, why not sell? Then put the % markup profit towards my own BTC stash :)

As said, Bitcointalk has a nice marketplace section. 
[Here]( is the link directly to the marketplace section encase you have trouble navigating to it from the main page.

How so? Cash by mail? Bank deposits? WU? Which cash method would be the best bet?
