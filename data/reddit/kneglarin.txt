does it have to be paypal? copenhagenbitcoin.dk transers it straight to your bankaccount. paypal does have some issues because of chargebacks

u/teslamodel be careful with paypal. Payer can chargeback the payment after you transfer the bitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:15:09

Well, My workstation has Debian Stretch 9.2 installed.
**First the staging script 01.sh:**
    
    
    apt install debootstrap syslinux isolinux squashfs-tools genisoimage memtest86+ rsync
**Then the bootstrap and install packages script 02.sh:**
    
    
    mkdir live_boot
    
    debootstrap --arch=i386 --variant=minbase stretch live_boot/chroot 
    
    cp -a files/root live_boot/chroot/
    cp -a files/sddm.conf live_boot/chroot/etc/
    cp -a files/display-manager.service live_boot/chroot/etc/systemd/system/
    touch live_boot/chroot/root/.hushlogin
    
    cat &lt;&lt; EOF | chroot live_boot/chroot
    
    echo "zerotrust" &gt; /etc/hostname
    
    echo -e "root
root" | passwd root 
    
    apt update
    
    apt install --no-install-recommends --yes --force-yes linux-image-586 live-boot systemd-sysv pciutils usbutils syslinux nano task-kde-desktop task-laptop python3-pyqt5 python3-pip python3-setuptools libzbarqt0 python-qrtools zbar-tools  kwin-x11 locales systemsettings plymouth plymouth-themes
    
    plymouth-set-default-theme -R spinner
    
    apt clean
    pip3 install wheel
    pip3 install 
    
    EOF
    
**Then some maintenance 03.sh:**
    
    
    cp files/20-quiet-printk.conf live_boot/chroot/etc/sysctl.d/
    cp -a files/locale.gen live_boot/chroot/etc/
    
    cat &lt;&lt; EOT | chroot live_boot/chroot 
    locale-gen
    EOT
    
**Create the ISO  file 04.sh:**
    
    
    rm -rf live_boot/image/{live,isolinux}
    
    mkdir -p live_boot/image/{live,isolinux}
    
    cp files/isolinux.cfg live_boot/image/isolinux/

**Thats about it**
One thing is missing here and that is the contents of root (root's home folder). Im not sure if i have cleaned it up. Maybe some private stuff in it.
It's contents has autologin and icons for electrum and other tools and a bitcoin wallpaper:)
I could release it to github if if has enough public interest.
**Edit:** formatting and spelling, and then some

Couldn't agree more. There is alot of trust involved in using proprietary hardware wallets.
And you can make your own for a few bucks.
Im using an old laptop, ripped out the wireless, bluetooth and 3g hardware. And the harddrive and cd-drive:), and the battery.
Made me a bitkey USB boot.
And purchased cryptosteel to save key.
1. Prepare unsigned transaction with online watchonly Electrum wallet.
2. Boot laptop with bitkey USB
3. Remove bitkey USB
4. Transfer unsigned transaction to laptop with another USB stick.
5. Remove that USB stick.
6. Restore private key from cryptosteel to offline Electrum wallet.
7. Sign transaction
8. Display signed transaction as QR code
9. Broadcast it via mobile phone
That way there is no way the private key can leak out.
Actually bitkey has an outdated electrum, so i had to make my own liveboot using with electrum 3

Ok, what subjects not alliwed to discuss here. And is there a place where deleted post go. Or do they disappear.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:19:24
I created a Debian Stretch Live USB/CD on an Debian Stretch:)
**Edit:** grammar
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:12:05
no need for that
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:02:36
How so? 
Are posts deleted?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:01:40
Where. I have searched high and low. Google, Reddit, Twitter. 
The whole Bitcoin system has grinded to a complete halt. Millions of dollars in limbo, and r/bitcoin is not discusding it?
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:56:35
Been thinking about the same thing to. But its difficult to fin a good place to start. 
I think it might be a good place to start with Breadwallet, but it lacks segwit. But it should be possible. And use LND/Neutrino as inspiration. It has some known major issues, but i have tried LND in Neutrino mode on testnet and it syncs a lot faster and works pretty well. 
LND is written in GO, so it is a rewrite to swift.
Anyways, Im in. Ligthning makes no sense without a good iPhone wallet.
