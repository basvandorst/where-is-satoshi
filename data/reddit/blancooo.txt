Why  not just set a limit sell?
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:14:41
Yeah unfortunately that’s the only way (to my knowledge) to convert directly to fiat aside from localbitcoins. I’ve only used it once since the BCH fiasco so i can’t attest to how it’s been, but i do feel like there’s more support for GDAX interface. People that use the Coinbase app / site have always gotten shit on with higher fees / prices and less trade freedom since the start.

Oooo burn

How is it free

Are you buying the dips and selling the highs on each coin? Or trading between coins as the gap between their values rise and fall?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:39:11
Pretty much. To be honest neither are at a level where they can be a stable currency yet, so both are pure speculation. I will say that bitcoin cashes pump and dumps and Roger Ver’s actions do make it seem pretty sketchy.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:32:44
Use GDAX.

I would diversify into altcoins atm. Still a lot of fomo goin on and imo the announcement of futures has got speculation on btc at an all time high.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:42:20
Look into alts

Not to mention you can’t choose your fee on Coinbase so they max it out. On most hardware and software wallets you can set your own fee. The less you pay, the slower transaction but hey all things considered I’d rather wait an hour and spend the equivalent $2-4

Lol yeah google helps 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:25:47
It seems like it already is...
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:35
If you’re asking this question, it’s because you haven’t experienced a dip before. Stay in the game longer and monitor it  before you buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:33:41
I take no sides on the fork, but i believe they call themselves the “real bitcoin” because as of current, they’re doing more of what the original Satoshi white papers intended: trustless transactions with super low fees. Bitcoin atm has more demand of transaction than supply so fees and transaction times are high. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:14:25
I’ve never used it, but you can try localbitcoins.com. You’d be buying and selling directly from other users instead of an exchange i believe.

If this got serious i would donate for the cause.

Please update your iPhone.
Gdax is owned by Coinbase with less fees. Deposit your money on their usd account and buy on gdax 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:56:11
Hmm, i tried that and i got nothing. Did you have to have the btc on the ledger specifically at the time of the fork? Or is it based on when you bought it in general?
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:02:59
If you don’t mind me asking, what’s the process for getting bitcoin gold from what you have in your ledger wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:28:30
The beauty is you don’t have to buy a whole one. I started buying in at 4500 and i still don’t have a whole one (mainly because of diversification into other alts). Keep 100 bucks or whatever you can spare on an exchange and buy in on a dip. Repeat monthly. It seems risky for sure, but assuming we continue on the trend we’re on, when you get to the point where your btc’s value is half what you put in and half profit it stops feeling as sketchy. I don’t recommend keeping all of it in an exchange wallet though. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:01:18
Yeah i went from bittrex to my segwit address on my ledger and it was no prob 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:13:50
Yeah if anything, with more and more news about bitcoin entering the financial sector we might actually be in for a big hike.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:58:15
What would be a good platform for something like this? The only thing that makes sense is Kickstarter or something along those lines 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:20:45
What if’s get you nowhere. Either get some and hodl for the long haul or start learning how to read the market and try your luck at day trading. There’s still money to be made my friend. If a government bailouts influenced bitcoins birth, imagine what another will do with its popularity.

GDAX is owned by Coinbase and has less fees. Can’t use a credit card though and I‎t takes like a week to transfer fiats into heir account ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:40:30
Kinda depends on if you’re a short or long term investor. You’re right though. For a hodler it doesn’t really matter that much

All i see is come guy clicking around in chrome inspector on some bogus site. Read a book this is clearly bogus.
