she is wearing shorts if you inspect for about 2 seconds.
I usually dont call out sexism and all that shit, but boi you might be sexist.
also youve prob never seen a hooker in vietnam
Also youre prob 15 if I had to guess. but you could also be 26

i mean I can see yourself trying to save-yourself from your previous comment. And I mean technically you sound right.
But lets be real dawg, you said shes not wearing any bottom attire. Whether its shorts or pants. She looks like shes not wearing any bottoms, true, but she is.
You just wanted to use the no pants comment to further your point that she may be a hooker, because in your mind, hookers dont wear pants. but yo, they do

Honestly it sucks
They sold really badly made tshirts(homemade for sure with an iron like my gf makes) for like 30 euro. No thanks
Sold shit you can buy on Aliexpress(for $1) for like 20euro(bitcoin in coin form)
The guy at the front didnt really want to converse about crypto
fucking 2/10 experience honestly 
0 idea how this place makes money, I guess their bitcoin ATM?
Then again what do you sell at a BTC store. Im pretty sure this place just launders money ie: not to pay taxes on capital gains on crypto they do it via selling "shirts and shit" Seems like it could work. They prob burn shirts they produce so it seems like its a legit business where transactions take place and they keep "paying their business" with bitcoin
Thats just my theory after being in that shop. 100% nobody buys anything from that store its utter shit-tier-quality items that even non crypto people would be like wtf.
 The bitcoin-coin that the guy wanted to sell me, he had to go through 10 before we could find one that wasn't crack or damaged. 100% sketchy shit goes down here
You can google search how their stores looks on inside and what they sell.

@_date: 2018-08-08 17:09:49

@_date: 2018-10-04 18:09:32
Sorry what exactly are we solving for.
an address? private key? or is that the point of the thing.
How are we supposed to retrieve the 310 BTC if we get "in"

bc reddit is not longer the place of open discussion
you discuss what the gov/marketing companies want you to discuss.
Good news is this means there will be a new reddit in 5 years while this place becomes 9gag/Imgur spin off
