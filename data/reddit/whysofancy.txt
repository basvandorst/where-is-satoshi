Hi, happy cakeday! A possibly stupid question: if you transfer some bits into a paper wallet and lose it are the bits gone forever?
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:04:19
Noted with thanks! Yea, it's almost impossible to say which other coin would replace it in that scenario; at least for now.
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:54:29
Thanks for your perspective and advice.

Hey thanks for the advice and my first bits! :)
2) I suspected that might be the case, thanks for explaining it clearly.
3) &lt;3
4) Will read more about paper wallets and Trezor, thanks!

Thanks for the the time and advice.
1) What are your thoughts about NXT? I considered Dogecoin as well but will it slowly be inflated since it's going to be infinitely minable? (If not how exactly does that work out?) Will do some more reading on Litecoin
4) Will read more about paper wallets, thanks!

Sorry no idea about the atms, just wanted to ask: are the atm rates are generally higher than that of the various bitcoin trading sites (for SGD)? 
Actually I think there might be one at hackerspacesg. Cannot confirm though.

Hey thanks for the tip! A followup question: Then seeing that there will only be a limited amount of Bitcoins made, it's possible for this number to drop over time as keys are lost?
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:34:11
Thanks for the advice!
1) The reason why I asked about other cryptocurrencies is because I read that the 1MB limit on block size for Bitcoin might result in another cryptocurrency replacing it.
2) Re: cloud mining I think they do use it themselves but do not want to put all their eggs in one basket so they sell the processing power to others as an investment for themselves. But yeah, it makes it an investment on an investment and since it's getting harder to mine it might not be worthwhile anymore which is why I asked.
3) Yeah, I should have used my common sense on this one.. Thanks.
Sorry if I wasted your time with common sense questions, I guess I'm just really excited about Bitcoins now and should just sit down to think about these questions myself. Thanks for answering anyways!

With everyone dumping BCC, who are the people buying them at likely their peak prices now?
