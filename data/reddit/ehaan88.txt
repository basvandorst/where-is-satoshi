There is a coin called folding coin.  So you can do the GPU folding and they reward you instead of points for their Foldingcoin.  As you can guess its super valuable.

Yes that looks very promising.  Thank you for that!

I don't know what's worse here... 
- using bitpay 
- why you are using your phone at 4% battery  
- having 33 freaking tabs open on your browser.

So what's one you consider safer than coinomi?  Seriously asking.  Can you do what coinomi does (multiple coins under one passphrase).  I have done copay and mycelium and from the actual app on the phone I liked being able to use all funds and it would zero the amount out which is what drew me to mycelium but then I liked coinomi for being able to have addresses for multiple coins which to me is what makes it act like a a true, traditional purpose of a wallet.

I can appreciate your take on things.  It’s actually quite good to hear.  I try to read as much of the case but usually find a lot of reference to the big business side of things with 2x.  No I am not an expert.  Not by any means.  Not sure what the math conference analogy has to do with running a full node.  The internet when you look at it in depth can be pretty complex.  So do you mean that I can’t browse the internet?  To me a full node is a vote.  I am conservative in pretty much all things in life.  So because of that I will go with what core agrees with. 
To me 2x is a push by greed and if it has the potential to make things centralized, I would not want that.  I don’t like seeing big pools throw their weight around.  I support a family of 5 on a $70,000 salary and I see bitcoin as a store of value and love how bitcoin works.  
What’s the rush?  I mean, really?  I don’t know why other than business trying to get the upper hand and take and take that they feel like core can’t work on things.   If bitcoin is the new gold and we still have a small amount of the population really just beginning to get involved and understand it why do we need to push things?  
Wow, this  all started from a simple question about when to run a script which I normally don’t ask on reddit as I am not usually engaging in topics but oh well.  
You can think I am an idiot noob who doesn’t know anything about the magic internet money.  That’s fine.  I’m not the person lecturing at the math conference asking how to add.  I’m the student taking in the info, probably sitting in the back row, but I still have a voice because I love math and I want more people to experience math and benefit from it.
I don’t want math being changed by a company with power or a mining pool with majority so I say support core.

So do you support 2x?  Just because I had an impulsive question on what its doing doesn’t mean I don’t care.  its basically peerblock for full nodes.  But it seems like a cat and mouse game to simply ban them.  based on some other questions in this thread you are probably even more mad because there are a lot of “noobs” out there that want to see core succeed and if you want to flame all of us for caring even though we are new go ahead.

stupid question, but does this only need to be done once?  or how often?  I am running the script right now and its showing a list of (2x) agents.  just wondering if I should do it again the closer to the fork or not.

I have set up 2 in the past week in different locations.  Working on setting up a third.  I had to modify the config to limit the number of connections and speed per incoming connection as I only have 5mb upload to work with in both locations.  Trying to help!
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:08:18
It’s ok it’s not a bunch of note 7’s
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:38:11
I’ve done and do all but step 12 so far

I don't know much about changelly, but I thought they accepted credit card.  I created an account and didn't have to verify anything.  I think it's a low amount you can buy though.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:20:14
I would say for sure 250gb

I have three running in different locations.  I do a raspberry pi 3 and external drive for one.  It’s funny because I live in southwest Minnesota and I am the only one it looks like on the map in the tri state area!  If you add parameters in the config you can limit the number of connections and upload speed to make it friendlier on a cable modem connection.

Keep them on your wallet, send them to an address on the exchange you want to cash them in on.
I guess I don’t know why this is foreign to you if you came from Coinbase.  You had to provide a banking account presumably there so when you want to get cash for your coin send it back to Coinbase and sell it back to them and the money would get deposited into your banking account.  I think you can send it to a PayPal account also.

I am just running the qt wallet on windows 10.  
This section on the site explains it.  Basically the same area that your wallet.dat file is there should be a bitcoin.conf file where you can put custom parameters.  Once you save your changes there close and reopen the wallet.  When the wallet starts it applies any config file settings.  Here are a couple I use:
 number of total connections
 upload in Kb per connection
You can also do maxreceivebuffer if you don’t want it eating your download too.  I would just google for more info on config parameters.  I found a site that can generate your config file based on what you want in it.  I will look for the link.
I was hesitant to run one myself until I found out you can throttle it.  I would love to give it more but that’s all I can spare.

I set up three and I am the only one in my tri state area!
