They are on a mission to dumb down the public.  How misleading of them to steer you away from what can be the easiest way to become a millionaire on human history.

Everything on earth is in constant change.  So why not currency?  Is currency going to stay the same forever?

With Cryptocurrency you are in it for the long haul.  It's not get rich quick it's get rich slow.  Make a cash out date two or three years down the road and stick to it.  Condition yourself so that anything in between doesn't matter.  Only two things will stop the rise.  USA Governer ban and or crash.  If the volatility worries you buy $100 bucks worth of alt coin and you are still sitting pretty no matter what happens.

Any currency can drop to zero at any moment.  You have to ask yourself what backs currency today?   Most of today's currency is backed by something physical you hold in your hand.  That gives the older generation a feeling of security.  It's been ingrained in them is the best investment is something you hold or stand on.  Ya know gold, silver and property.  Which currency of today can say they are backed by a technology?  Only Cryptocurrency can and technology is going know where only getting better.  Bitcoin is now a grandpa in Cryptocurrency currency years.  The second wave of millionaires is about to made by alt coins.  All Cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin is considered a Alt coin.  In the future it will be well which technology backs your currency?

Another thing bitcoin can be backed by, is Blockchain and advanced technology.  If the technology gets implemented in almost every system around the world, then that's a backing.  Another backing is that bitcoin is produced by real energy.  Energy that is transferred into value represented by math.  For us that has beem in crypto for over at least a year can wrap our minds around this.  People who don't get it yet will have a hard time understanding or even believing all this.  I got fired from mcdonalds for debating crypto with customers.  No politics is mcdonalds rule.  The old man kept coming back for more and I just send him off with more knowledge that pissed him off.  He came in and cut in line and didnt even order anything, but just to show me some wack article on how bitcoin is dead.  Since they warned me once they fired me the second time and I didn't even egg it on.  So I got fired from mcdonalds because of cryptocurrency....

You're right.

This story was on Reddit since 2013.  Things can change very fast.  If Bitcoin hits 100,000 this year then the time line will be dead on accurate.

Remember when gas was super expensive like 5 or 6 years ago and some gas stations started giving people discounts if they used cash rather than a debit or credit card because the transaction fees were getting to high?

Do you have to do the KYC process every time when buying from from a coin star machine?  I hope that once you go through the process, they dont make you do it again on the next bitcoin purchase.

I'm lonely anyways.

Its just a easy on-ramp for those who dont have bank accounts to buy on coinbase and want to use USD to purchase Bitcoin.  You could go to paxful or local bitcoins to buy it p2p through cash deposits at bank accounts but those fees are much higher.

No dang it I knew it would be interpreted that way after I uploaded it.  I have bought bitcoin before.  I was saying this is my first time buying bitcoin using coinstar.  I said it softly but pointed at the machine in a gesture.

The kyc registration was very easy amd took about five minutes to get verified.  From the time I placed the money in the machine to the time I recieved my bitcoin was almost exactly 70 minutes.

Another question I get a lot is "what is Bitcoin backed by?"  
@_date: 2019-02-17 05:16:21
Using bitcoin to purchase gift cards through e gifter I always pay less than the actual cost of what I buy because of their discounts when using bitcoin.  A $20 dominoes gift card I bought with bitcoin last night ended up only being $18.70

This is called portability.  Even one million dollars in USD in smaller denominations can get very heavy.
@_date: 2019-02-13 07:11:20
Wow, very exciting and thank you.  This is my first tip on reddit and I hope there are many more to come by me adding value, educating and contributing anyway I can in a positive way.

Guys, this is what a true bitcoiner looks like.

Which gambling device hit zero if any ever?

Since you cant send it to another waller and dont even own the private keys I would say it's a no go.  The only reason I would do it is to pad my gain stats the site or to help track exactly how much your investment is gaining if you can't do it yourself.
