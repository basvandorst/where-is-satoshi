Yup, it comes as no surprise when one gets the blue glove treatment from the TSA when one is carrying anything marked with the word "Bomb" on it.  It's pure stimulus response, like Pavlov's Dog.  I don't think this has anything to do with bitcoin except possibly after they looked through the bags at which point ignorance and paranoia took over until they had some kind of clue that the passenger wasn't dangerous or breaking the law, but that took time and lots of awkward interactions.

The TSA was doing their job within the best of their ability.  If someone arrives bearing a logo with the word "bomb" on it, expect the ears of any competent agent to perk up.  They would then find themselves wondering what bitcoin is.  Bitcoin is hard enough to explain, but try to explain it anew to a TSA agent who is already suspicious of you.  Things are certain not to go well there.   Its pure stimulus response combined with the paranoia that comes from ignorance.  Humans at their best. ;-)

If bitcoin is the wild west of finance then I'd see it likely that a lynch mob is coming for anyone related to MtGox.  It would be best for them to lay low, very low, change one's identity, do it again a bit later just for safety.  A mob is a-comin' along with torches, pitchforks, and a nicely tied up rope.  They know what to do with horse thieves and bank robbers.

If Ron Paul proves to be pro-BTC, great!! If he instead wants to try advocating wise US financial decisions like balancing the budget and improving the health of US federal currency reserves, also great!!  A strong USD helps commerce for everyone, even BTC owners.  Its not necesarily either/or.  Stability in one sector can help stabilize the other.  Perhaps the US should buy BTC as a reserve asset for USD.  (oh yea, I forgot, their broke)
