Topics that I will cover in the opinion:  
1. There is a big difference between security and utility tokens.  
2. Mining Bitcoin is public utility and should not be taxed.  
3. Spending Bitcoin should not cause capital gains taxation, it should be treated like spending euros.

You forgot to mention he doesn't face criminal charges. On the contrary, gets a major severance package. That's how the fiat launderers roll.

They already shut down in Finland. The founder lives in Switzerland currently.

100%. But we should not leave it there, but push for free use of cryptos as payments.

If Bitcoin has the same status as Euros as a currency, there should be no tax in spending it. The taxation should concern only earning it as a salary or receiving it as revenue. VAT concerns the services rendered against the coin, not the coin itself.

This is exactly what we did! ����

Thanks buddy! I will suggest the mining to have value as a public utility, and as such should not be taxed. This would be the same position that Germany currently has on mining.

Yes, that is utterly, completely unreasonable. It does not make sense. But that is what happens when government bureaucrats apply laws on stuff that they have no clue about. Luckily the awareness is increasing.

A lot of what you say here makes sense. The accounting part is challenging as the parties can be anywhere in the world and you can't be sure if the receiving party categorized your expense as income under their own legislation.  
The mining position comes from the current German model. Tax free running of blockchain nodes makes those blockchains much more robust and less dependent on commercial server farms.  
The security token benefits are pretty awesome. They should be embraced.

The meeting with the tax administration was constructive, and our points were listened to. They even were appropriately sarcastic about the Finnish taxation:
"We tax everything that moves, and especially those things that don't move!"
Joking aside, at least now they have their facts in order, and they do understand that with the current taxation, no blockchain business will happen in Finland. Given the long term potential of this technology area, it would be fiscally irresponsible for the government to prevent that industry from operating in the country. I think changes will come, but will they be big enough and happen fast enough? Time will tell.
