Bet early and bet often?

Because the credit card companies don't want to pay the royalties to use the technology.  We're only a couple years away from the IP running out.  Then they can implement it for free

It could be a combination of the threee

I was checking to see if anyone else mentioned this.  Thanks for the post!  Saw it on Person of Interest and Blacklist.  Still catching up on Almost Human

The author barely knows anything about credit cards, so how can we expect them to be knowledgeable about Bitcoin?

If your nearing the end of your Freshman year and you will open it the day you graduate, wouldn't it be 3 years and ~3 months from now?

There's probably some genius out there who thinks he's crafting bitcoins out of his gold.

I'd like to get a few more details about the game than what is posted on the indiegogo or your website (especially before I commit money to the project).  Can you give us a ballpark estimate of:
1. What amounts of Bitcoins are at stake/What would be at stake today?
2. How long would it take to mine/How much do the upgrades help?
3. Are these teamups verbal or are there going to be groups in-game?
In a sense, I'd like to get some actual numbers associated with everything, even if they are guesstimates/bound to change.

I support bitcoin.  Quotes like these don't really help its image.

Quotes like this make me cringe, mostly because they are so overused by scams and pyramid schemes

I've been thinking of doing the same

Maybe there's another wallet?

Not sure if you placed a line on the graph or if you used regression analysis to get the line.

I saw one of these articles earlier today and all I could think was "that's not how it went down"
Also lol'd at the "Thief! What's Bitcoin, what's Reddit?" comments
