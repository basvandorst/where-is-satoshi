Makes sense.  Its so tempting to try and dump now and wait for the dip to rebuy, but I just dont want the stress.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:21:46
I would guess a prolonged dip will happen in the next few months.  Possibly down to 7-9k for a few months.  But the trend of chips out of an ever growing mountain will continue as 25k becomes the next target in about a year's time.

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:33:24
Yeah, that was definitely what was going on around that 10k mark.  Would you say right now there's more pumping than was happening then?  Are they just watching for a bit to see how much all the normies will buy?

Its the safest way to ensure you dont lose your bitcoins.  It basically stores your private key.  If you don't transfer to your hardware wallet, a 3rd party is keeping your coins.

You'll be bathing in satoshis.  Even better.  Dirty fiat $ bath means you'll need a shower after anyway.

GDAX is the new NFL
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:18:37
You can move it to GDAX (which is operated by coinbase) and then withdraw to your offline wallet for free.  Sometimes it takes a few tries.  I just bought an extra .05 and it took 3 tries to withdraw before it went through, but then it was intsantly viewable on blockchain.info.

Wow.  Good for you!  Truly inspiring.  Can't wait for mine

Thank you for the tough love.  Got my .222 in a paper wallet now.  HODL
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:37:29
Really appreciate your instruction.  That first part was a little over my head (stupid mac guy) 
By "boot from liveUSB" do you mean turning off wifi, turning off my computer, connecting an external drive and booting from said drive?  I have a backup external drive, but Im not sure if I can boot from it.  Probably something I can google if its an eye-roller of a question.

Another super noob here...bought .111 today.  Not sure how to move to a truly secure wallet
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:38:04
Noob here.  I made a paper wallet with my system offline, but i dont have a printer, so I just wrote down the keys on a piece of paper.  I saved the paper wallet as a .pdf with a random file name.  I turned my wifi back on without deleting the file.  I transferred my coins from an online wallet to my cold storage paper wallet and doubled checked an hour later to see they made it through the blockchain.  Am I 100% safe regarding the .pdf on my system?  (Assuming nobody finds the hand written codes or my .pdf file by stealing my laptop)  I guess I'm paranoid about hackers knowing what to look for in a paper wallet image file even if it has a random name.

What you need to do to get them out of the website's hands is to create your own wallet.  There are devices you can buy called hardware wallets, but for now, a paper wallet is fine.  Here's a link that walks you through the steps: 
After you complete this, you'll have a page with both your public and private key.  Guard the private key like you would cash.  The steps above will show you how to keep it completely unexposed to the internet.  Many people print it out, laminate it or put it in a plastic bag and lock it in a safe or safe deposit box at the bank.  
HODL : )
