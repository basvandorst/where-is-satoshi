Seed and pin?  Man I’ve been following bitcoin for a while but it still seems like there’s so much more to learn.

Thanks mom.  I think this guy knows his way around a weapon.  Maybe, just maybe he may be a trained professional.

Bunch of criminal jack offs. Who are they to say what is or isn't?

Do I make this number up and where do I register it?  On coinbase or a similar site?  
Thanks so much btw

Alright here is what I have gathered and the pieces that are missing
1) get a wallet like multibit or coinbase
2) import to flash drive
3) put flash drive into computer that has never been online
4) upload wallet onto this computer and make my own code 
5) print out QRS code 
Then do I go back online and tell my online wallet what my offline wallets address is?  
That's where I'm tripped up.  If this other computer is never online and I made up a code then how does this offline computer know what I have in cryptocurrency?

I was gonna say, if it was ever at $.01 anyone that invested $100 would be worth ~ $6,000,000 today.  
But still, $2 would have been so so sweet.

So this is what other threads on here were talking about.  
I am a noob when it comes to BTC.  I googled paper wallet instructions and the link I followed said that I need blockchain app, which isn't available in the App Store. 
You could have just said nothing or guided me to better info instead of being asshole.  
Sorry not everyone got on board at the same time you did.

I looked him up.  wiki has his social stances, which I agree with, being I'm socially very liberal.  I'm going to have to do more digging to see where he stands on guns and his fiscal standings.  
All I'm saying is, I looked him up and I'm interested.  He's at least being noticed by a lot more people, which is always good

So I just go to a site that randomly generates 58 digit code and then write it down?  After that how is known to be connected to my cryptocurrency?

How do I get a paper wallet?  I take the QR code and print it?
