my transaction at 12sat/byte fee is still at 0 confirmations after 3 weeks. Competitive fee basically render transaction useless. Horrible for purchasing
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:43:19
It’s absurd that you praise a $2 fee. Maybe it is negligible for you but for smaller transactions it is not acceptable

Have you even read 2nd sentence of my comment? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:05:51
I know
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:24:33
that book is indeed a very good read
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:40:01
sorry but what is "long term"
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:09:04
That’s why you should have personal money to spend no questions asked. Set with your wife a certain $ per month that you can spend freely no questions asked

no one in their right mind would post that they have $ millions using a 3 year old account.
asking if people want free stuff. Wow, I wonder if there would be a single person looking for free BTC
Someone that clever to buy $1000 of BTC in 2010 and hodl until now is not going to brag. Just post saying you are planning/looking for treasure hunters
You have made 6 comments in 3 years and now you are organising a community event

@_date: 2017-12-28 15:45:54
dude thats my dream. I have put in 100$ couple of weeks ago and i aim to make at least 1000$ for the next iPhone :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:09:16
Wow that’s incredible, thanks for sharing

It is off putting how bad bitcoin is in terms of technology. I went in with mainstream news couple of weeks ago. Right now, unless you are investing thousands of dollars you should not even touch bitcoin. It is supposed to be digital currency but now it is only an investment opportunity

your math checks out, can confirm he is indeed an engineer 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:51:44
Then police would pick up the drive following the murder investigation
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:30:04
kind of meta right now, good investment
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:40:45
will i get banned here if i mention anything related to coins other than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:36
well since he is not bashing himself for selling at 2.40 I am pretty sure he has some left
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:33:00
hopefully he deleted his account for privacy and security concerns
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:44:16
out of the loop, whats going on? is bitcoin crashing again?
