Yeah, unless you have a regime like China....but I agree, and as it is stated in the article, miners just move their operations.

So I guess.....thanks Trump?

I just told my 76 year old mother about Bitcoin. She is no the proud owner of 0.020 BTC.
Let’s not disappoint my mom, ok?

It's where I have my adress for spam.

I have reached my personal moon. My humble hodlings are now worth 1000€. Enough to pay for a Nintendo Switch and a new matress.
I have bought both, but will continue to hodl as long as I can....and don't need the cash...

That is the only way I am making money off Bitcoins right now: by hodling the Square Stock.
I bought at 41 when they first announced Bitcoin support, only to see the price plummet shortly after.....well, it was merely a dip.
Stock is at 65 today!

Came here to say this: eventually, they got ate!

I am not so sure about all that. Shareholders are interested when your company is at the forefront of a currently hyped trend. It creates buzz. Not all stock prices are only linked to net gain.
However, you are correct in saying that Square offers a great service and this deserves to perform well.

Well, I am still on Kraken even though the site is awful. I can't find an exchnage that let's me trade Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum from Europe.....
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:37:40
HODL? Fuck that! I bought more at 5600€...roughly 6600USD!!

Let me chime in on the "sell" side of the arguement here.
Debt can be psychologically stressful. Straining really. 
At leas consider a half-measure, sell some, keep some.
Paying of debt is a real achievement. Sure, not as sexy as buying a house, but a real goal to have reached. 
In the end, having no loan to pay back is extra money in your account eveery month!

Yeah.....I bought some ETH and BCH as well though....so my BTC gains are diminished. :(
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:29:15
I got a bit excited....but really it is just barely above the high of the Bitcoin announcement a while ago....
But yes, I believe in the stock.
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:04:08
Whatever they do, I hope it gives their stock a boost. I bought in at the top of the BTC hype, and the stock has a hard time working its way back up....
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:21:28
Dude, I am debating right now to sell my Coins as soon as they are worth whatever a Nintendo Switch costs......
I mean...who knows, right? Might kick myself, might buy back in at the next dip.....whatever. This shit feels like gambling...
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:32:08
Yes, think about it, and then buy their stock. I can't take this rollercoaster anymore...

Wow, 454 upvotes for not even going inside?
And what did I get? 30 upvotes....

They do have some points, but it turns real anti-semitic with the "House of Rothschild"....I stopped watching then.

Goddamnitreddit.....my post hardly got any love and I went through the trouble to go inside and take pictures:
