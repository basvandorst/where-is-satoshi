In an actual zombie apocalypse bartering probably makes more sense anyway. Why tf would I want gold? I'd want clean water, canned food, batteries, blankets, probably a gun, etc etc.
And my own supplies are probably worth more than gold because I'm gonna have a hard time precisely divvying it up and weighing it out, let alone smithing it into coins

True, but even in countries with total financial collapse, they're a large distance away from a full blown zombie apocalypse.

Morty is very similar to Jerry, who Rick just kicked out. Interesting thought for their future dynamic

Just to tackle your first paragraph, you're right that there are no "universal" rules about giving credit in anything, technically. But just like good book publishers enforce proper conduct in their authors, and recognized academic institutions regulate their professors and students in their papers, academic journals, and other works, there are institutions out there that work in coding and programmer conduct.
Schools like MIT have sections on writing code in their academic integrity handbooks. Corporations like Oracle, Apple, and Microsoft have their developers include citations when they use another programmer's work. 
[Search Microsoft within this page to see a Chromium developer cite Microsoft's developer network for some code he used](
So within academic and professional circles, there are indeed standards for citing your work. Its considered good practice to follow these rules as a programmer, even if you're self employed. By using another programmer's code without permission or without giving credit, you open yourself up to an intellectual property case if you're caught. Google and Apple comply with IP takedown requests and will remove your app off the Play Store and the App Store if you're caught. They've also gone as far as banning developer accounts for repeated instances of IP theft.
