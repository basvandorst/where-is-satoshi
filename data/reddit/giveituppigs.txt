The armed bully with a weird costume admits to doing it to others "every single day" at 4:15 of the video. If you see the picture of him posing with the cash, it appears as if he thinks he's a cool guy when he's really just a piece of garbage with a badge that enjoys harassing civilians for no reason. How are these cops going to survive when drugs are legal and almost all cash is capable of being backed up?

More info: "The out-of-state motorist was stopped for doing 78 mph in an 75 mph zone. Deputy Dove finds $50,000 cash and $10,000 in cashiers checks during unauthorized search of the car.
Deputy Dove: "Well, I'm gonna search that vehicle first, ok?"
Innocent Man: "Hey, what's the reason you're searching my car?"
Dove: "Because I'm talking to you ... well, no, I don't have to explain that to you. I'm not going to explain that to you, but I am gonna put my drug dog on that (pointing to money). If my dog alerts, I'm seizing the money. You can try to get it back but you're not."
Innocent Man: (inaudible) got it in Vegas."
Dove: "Good luck proving it. Good luck proving it. You'll burn it up in attorney fees before we give it back to you. It's your call. If you want to walk away, you can take the cashiers checks, the car and everything and you can bolt and you're on your way. But you're gonna be walking away from this money and abandoning it."
