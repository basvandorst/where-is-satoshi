No idea, I'm not that smart to predict crisis :-P 
But you can see these patterns (eg: slow downs every 10 years) and people using credit for everything. Before 2018 was house loans, now it's credit cards, car loans, student loans...

I was trying to say that most European countries were doing okay with a mix of capitalist and socialist policies ("moderate capitalism/socialism"). You have a free market but you also have free education and free healthcare (just as good as private care in some countries).
Is Europe socialist? No, just like the US is not truly capitalist. Just like most things in life this doesn't have to be black and white. You can pick up good ideas from different ideologies. Is a bad thing that a capitalist country takes care of someone with cancer for free or without bankrupt them? I don't think so.

Well, if we think like that Venezuela is not a socialist country, United States is not capitalist and the Soviet Union wasn't communist. They are/were something else.

Meh, every 10 years or so there's an economic slow down. ~1990, ~2000, ~2010 (2008). Will it be the end of the world? Nope, but I expect Bitcoin's value to go up when the next crisis happens.

&lt;insert ideology here&gt; without brains never ends up well.
Most european countries are doing okay with moderate capitalism/socialism.

Put yourself in their shoes. They can't support BTC without being attacked by the BCH crowd, they have dumb users, they have users that only care about profits, they have to repeat themselves daily... and the list goes on.
Of course they're going to be "jerks". Just use the wallet, which is free, and you'll be fine.
