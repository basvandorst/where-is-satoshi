That has nada to do with the reality of some fully validating nodes bandwidth levels.

hal moved the coins satoshi sent him. satoshi also sent other coins and never moved them. hal was going to give the coins he had to his kids, but medical bills made him sell those off. if he was satoshi he would have moved more coins, as he needed the money for those bills. he had medical issues, if he was satoshi his family certainly would have known. stop stating online hal is satoshi as he certainly is not and was not.

My wallet is set to 78 sat/byte currently.

Don't you know some nodes may have been knocked off the main chain with that?

How much are the fees (average is $32 right now) if segwit was the tx type instead?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:53:54
Ver says what pushed him over the edge was the false accusation he had paid people to be shills and puppets for bitcoin cash.
IOW, he has not done that.

This might be a mixed blessing or worst news you could hear.

Someone being intentionally stupid is not Ver's fault.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:46:31
You means thanx to everyone who kept the blocks at 1 meg when they said 'if you accept segwit we will later give you 2 megabytes for blocksize' like dirty liars they are.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:28:38


It is not just segwit, segwit is only the first step in a 5 step master plan they have for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:21:05
If you want to give away your hard earned money in tx fees to miners who already are subsidized ....
...glad you recognize that nothing will keep them away.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:02:25
If bitcoin cash gets merchants to adopt payment, and a wallet company like blockchain adds bitcoin cash wallet, and users switch due to high fees, the market will reflect that, and hashpower will switch to match; with newer 7 nm asics coming out in the future, some miners may be over 1 petahash alone, the PoW won't be far behind ...

A lot of the government helpers that were brought in to bitcoin to assist their agenda seem to have problems with dealing with certain places; so coinbase was one the govt dufflepuds did not get accounts at or stayed away from.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:49:48


He started to explain that he was not doing that by mentioning he had money before bitcoin, but got cut off, for his argument.
Out of context, it sounds like he is demanding something for being wealthy ....
Which would not be out of the ordinary for some rich people but he was trying to explain why he certainly was not doing that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:10:28
Ver is not in trouble for having a wallet, sorry.
You think every noob is going to write their own raw transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:21:43
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:45:22
Moving to bitcoin cash would break the stranglehold of whatever has gotten in the water making core and supporters lose their bearings and perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:23:45


Out of context there.
He was accused of paying shills online.
He was starting to let people know he was rich before bitcoin to defend himself from the false accusation I have seen some spout around here, as it is not true.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:49:58


Lucky for you, by now instead of getting merely upset, he may have done something more than that ...
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:03:50
Looks like he intentionally did this knowing that would provoke him.
I can't see him doing the interview anyway stating regularly everytime he said 'Bcash', correcting him like correcting a special ed kid, 'bitcoin cash'.
blah blah blah bcash blah ...
...bitcoin cash ...
blah bcash blah ...
...bitcoin cash ....
bcash blah ...
...bitcoin cash.
bitcoin cash

f you i'm out of here

The blocksizes of the other chain also got larger than yours ...
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:14:47
I think he must mean salmon or trout or something.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:25:31
The other side has nothing to worry about with stuff like this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:46:46
So as I was saying in another comment somewhere about this sub, this type of thing fits in with this type of discourse here ...
edit: I should be upvoted for the shakespearian pun:
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:51:43
By jove, they are not using force to make people use segwit are they?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:13:39
You are unaware of the changes to the underlying protocol they want to put in while they have you out transacting on LN hubs?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:25:44
Wikileaks also thanked the govt for pushing them to take crypto in the first place as it has increased in value ...
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:58:24
"yes, our masters have thought of everything for us"
"{yes, tell us the next step too now"
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:56:56
regardless, whoever supported segwit, was advocating the 2 meg deal.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:53:28


Do you have medical credentials?
If not, you just libeled/slandered Ver.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:36:05
I agree, it would fit right in with the quality of info you are receiving to digest here.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:11:47


You are aware it does not purport to be one?
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:18:48
That nym is a great cover ...
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:30:26
so you are saying the govt does not know who nakamoto is ...
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:18:21
If it isn't the charlatan. Who woke you up this early?
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:04:32
Must have been some supersecret subliminal message that anyone can read into it with inference based on context; or it was just a random coincidence and he merely wanted to establish no pre mining solo...
