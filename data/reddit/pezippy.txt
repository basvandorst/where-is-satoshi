No one will know the future, bitcoin might not live forever, just like USD will not live forever. Every financial experts will tell you all Fiat currency have 100% failure rate, it's just matter of time.
but one thing is for sure, crypto currency concept is here to stay, it will continue to grow and expand way into the future. It have the potential to replace central banking systems.
so for haters out there, bitcoin will not live forever, USD will not live forever. don't expect crypto currency concept to go away, if you want it to go away, it can only happen in your dream.

I like this one, if this system does not pose a threat to banking system, there's no need to ban it.
It will die on its own time.
China foreseen the threat, that why they taken this action.
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:08:09
I wonder when will they start producing PHs miners for home user.
maybe 10 years or more, if that's the case there will be a trend of home miners dropping out, the profit will simply not exist for home miners.
After that, who's going to maintain the network.
big company? Oh becareful of the 51% attack.
@_date: 2014-05-20 09:19:25
What's funny?????
you think it's not possible.
don't pretend bitcoin is invincible, because you Are fooling yourself.

Why should I?
Why should I be slaves?

i got 4 miners, i had not mined a single bitcoin since the first day.
contributing hashing power to bitcoin network will simply reduce our profits.
you want return on investment?
DONT MINE BITCOIN.
If you mine other coins and bitcoin difficulty dont increase or decrease, your miners value will not decrease in value, let those people mining bitcoin continue to mine bitcoin.
STOP adding Hash power to it, if the difficulty remain the same for 6 months or decrease, you will get your return on investment, even if you mine other coins.
if you look at the litecoin Market, you will clearly see this trend, not everyone is mining litecoin.
its far more distributed hash rates. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:45:41
That is limited when you compare to early miners and investor of bitcoins, increase to $3000 is a extreme case.
For early investor of bitcoins, with $10000 investment, you will now be multi millionaire.
This is no comparison to just 500% profit from $10000
Early investor gain the most profit. 
I assure my self, bitcoin is the not the ultimate coin, another coin will take over.
bitcoin is the first, but It might not remain on top forever.

Oh yea, major flaw in bitcoin.
bitcoin going to reign.
what a load of BS, fix this major flaw before saying that.
@_date: 2014-04-30 00:21:37
love it. thats the way.
head on the wall, might wake people up and stop adding hash power to bitcoin network.
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:23:47
I invest in multiple coins, terracoins, peercoins, litecoins, dogecoins, heavycoins, of cause bitcoins 
I don't believe investing in only bitcoins is a wise move, no investor will tell you to invest in only one profile, because there's up and down in every investment.
bitcoin investment will only give you limited profit margin as a beginner.
Example: let's say you invest $10000 in bitcoin at the end of the year bitcoin increase to $3000
your profit is only $50000.
Bitcoin is not the only options of investment, invest in more potential coins.
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:58:44
Please do, then people will wake up and realize the need to fix this major flaw.
Stop putting bandaid and fix it.
Wake up.
what were you talking about on the litecoin and cointron??????
51% attack won't happen to bitcoin and telling people to dump litecoin.
Now this is happening to bitcoin, please dump your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:39:30
Stop adding to bitcoin hash rates, so people can make some money.
Stop adding miners to bitcoin network, the more people add, everyone profit suffers.
Everyone do their calculation, you add miners the more difficulty increases, the more it increase the more worthless your miners becomes.
Use your head.
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:39:28
I think it's better to target all cyptocurrency, not just bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is the first, but it's not necessary the best.

I don't think you know anything about vpn.
Also you don't understand the nature of bitcoin technology.
SSL VPN tunnels through https, thus blocking this will block all bank websites and all secure website.
SSL is difficult to block, because they require this service, if a country don't require any secure website, then they can block this.
But it's highly unlikely. 
Icmp vpn, with this one uses ping request, which most country don't block, including highly restrictive countries.
another one, developed by Microsoft, SSTP VPN also use https.
Yes, with these technology, there is not such thing as blocked website.
We can start a vpn business and sell vpn routers to Chinese to tunnel out.
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:23:49
You are making me laugh.
Bitcoin can be a subject of same attack.
A company or a large investor can easily take 51% of Bitcoin hashing power.
so what's the difference???

"No they can't" don't fool yourself.

If bitcoin don't fix up all the serious issues that it have, I tell you again.
YES THEY CAN.

The chances are, miner producer will not be able to produce home consumer PHs miners anytime soon.
even if they did, the cost will be sky high.
This will eventually lead to a halt or decrease on bitcoin difficulty, once it reach that stage, mining for bitcoin will not be profitable for home users and large numbers of them will drop bitcoin mining altogether, which will further decrease in difficulty.
Within the time frame of dumping bitcoin mining, large numbers of will choose altcoins, they might not want to sell their investment off at low price.
bitcoin is not perfect, just admit it guys.
bitcoin still have a lot to live upto, when it can really declare a war on central bank. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:23:56
China don't need bitcoin, China needs crypto currency. 
Bitcoin can fail, people need to realize that, but crypto currency concept will not fail.
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:21:35
I vote no.
There is a chance, but I vote no.
i just don't see the point, once beginner realized the profit margin is slim, they start investing in altercoins.
Mining starts to get pointless as the difficulty increases, large amounts of home users will drop bitcoin mining, this also leads them to other ccoins investment.
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:04:34
You are a fool to believe that this is the end of crypto currency.
Bitcoin can end, but the chance of crypto currency ending, friend I give you one sentence.
IN YOUR DREAM.
crypto currency concept will live on whether you like it or not.
People like us, does not like central banking system, because we know that system is a fraud.
We had been their slave for long enough, there is far more slaves that those who benefit from central bank system.
If slaves to banks population rise and overthrow banking system we can gain our freedom.
If we don't rise, banks will continue to slave us.

One day USD will collapse, this is absolute truth.
what system will the government use then?

The future trend of bitcoin mining is cloud mining.
Aren't you even a little scared of this???? This stupid mining company selling hashing power to people.
These companies can easily join to form 51% or more hashing power.
What then???? Bitcoin is not decentralized, but centralized to these companies and bitcoin networks is at the mercy of these companies. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:02:25
What for????? Why a bank?????

You are saying far to early
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:09:32
This is few reason why I don't believe in bitcoin.
I believe in crypto currency.
Bitcoin can not possibly become mainstream and maintain a world economy, simply 21 millions coins is far to little for world's population.
This is something that bitcoin community must accept as it's limit.
No one likes the idea of reduced pay rates, this is simply not built into human nature, people like increase salary and price of commodities to remains the same or reduced.
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:28:21
im not mining bitcoin.
so i never started it
i never told you to stop mining, i told you to stop adding hash power to bitcoin network.
you say its making bitcoin more valuable, if that is the case, when bitcoin difficulty increase, the exchange rate should also increase, if your statement is true to the dot. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 03:03:04
Agreed and point taken.
but other external factor contribute to the price is far greater.
anyway, its not going to increase forever, if the price of bitcoin is not going to increase.
Miners will eventually stop, but i do believe the price will go up.
 
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:41:47
Hahaha chips producer can easily monopolize this mining game.
They produce those chips, this means they can get the chips at a fraction of the cost.
This can easily be done.
proof of work system is not the solution.
The amount of money to take control of 51% is nothing for billionaires in this world.
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:44:40
Don't think they need to worry about bitcoin.
I don't think bitcoin will ever take over the world.
The potential is there for crypto currency, NOT BITCOIN.
Every country have different rules and regulations, if every country just use one currency, how are they going to regulate it for their country purpose?
Crypto currency offers the world a new system to consider, not every country wants to accept bitcoin as their national currency.
This innovation never existed before, if there's a collapse of Fiat currency, this system can be part of the government implementation.
Will government ever consider bitcoin to national currency, don't even think about it.
how are they distinguish themselves if they all use bitcoin?
so for those people out there thinking bitcoin can take over the world.
my view, it's not going to happen. Only this innovation have the potential. 
But for now, it's still early and we can still make profit from it.
but no wishful thinking, because it's clearly not possible for bitcoin to take over the world, it's just not in any countries interest to have same currency for the whole world.
@_date: 2014-04-27 06:26:16
China is not going to completely ban it, because it's not possible.
China produces large amount of bitcoin miners or other miners, these company will continue to pump out miners.
for short term, bitcoin price might crash, but this will not slow down the growth.
crypto currency will continue to grow whether they like it or not.
One example is Qcoin, which China banned but because it's company owned, China can stop it immediately.
Bitcoin is different, it's peer to peer, there's nothing they can do about it.
As long it holds value world wide, trades in China will not cease. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:38:36
What's the point?????
There's no improvement in power consumption. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:35:11
You need think twice before you saying what you said.
yes bitcoin is created out of thin air as well but this not controlled by banks, but controlled by people's
because it's people's controlled, then people can be their own banks, banks can not do what ever they like, they can't create money out of thin air and restrict them from scam monopoly.
Cryptocurrency now rely on traditional system, but this does not mean it will be like this forever.
Crypto currency can form its own economy that's not based on USD, AUD, EURO.
When the collapse of USD happen which it will happen, people will start searching for something secure, something that does not need to end like banking system.
Something that does not rob them and scam them.
At that point in time, if crypto currency stood out and gave enough stand, it can potentially become the new money system.
Banks have far to much power, this mean they can do what ever they like.
is this what you want? Forever be slaves to banks?
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:37:27
Absolutely correct.
it's also just numbers they typed into their computers.

STOP Adding hash power to Bitcoin.
its not the only crypto currency.
Drag the increase or decrease it. 
Its not going to increase forever, just watch it.
if the bitcoin price don't increase and difficulty keeps increasing, we will eventually see a decrease in difficulty.
i just wonder who will continue mining, when they have 3THs miners and only get 2 cents USD a day.
USE YOUR HEAD
@_date: 2014-04-30 01:37:37
STOP adding hashing power to bitcoin.
dont people get it. the more you add the more difficulty increase and faster it will increase.
@_date: 2014-05-20 11:27:05
I am not against bitcoin, but people here needs to realize, there is serious issues that requires attention. 
If those problems is not fixed, simply forget about bright future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:43:04
You are correct to certain extent, that's only for older generations, they will go after few years, did you think about newer generation, children encounter Ipad iPhone, smart phones, etc from their mothers womb. 
There is people out there who don't like internet, they want it banned.
If a country ban internet they will be seriously out of date and will drag them behind in their technology development.
There is also group out there who don't like emails, it had destroyed their posting profits. 
20 years later, crypto currency have the potential to replace what people know about money system, like it or not technology can change things, 
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:15:39
Walled hahaha money system aleady build a great wall.
What's the value of USD? 
What's the value of CNY? 
what's the value of euro? 
they all have a value of 0, it's only people trust them to have value, if not they all have a value of 0.
Banking system, please stop building walls to protect your fraud system. One thing surprise me about loan. 
When banks loan money they create IOU s, creating money out of thin air, in real essence banks don't have money to lend out, they just create it out of thin air. 
May I ask, what right does the bank have to charge people interest when they didn't have that money to loan out in the first place?
This interest system is a absolute fraud, creating money out of nothing and loaning money when they don't even have the money, then charge people interest on what they don't have in the first place.

fix the 51% attack issue, then I put more trust on bitcoin.
Flaws like this, just simply blows my mind away. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:28:59
Point taken.
that's what they will do, impossible to ban, but they will make their life difficult.
But no matter how difficult, working class people in China earns very little salary, this is greater difficulty. 
Bitcoin provides greater income in USA not CNY.
so for some, bitcoins profits pays to well for them and they will do whatever it takes to earn more bitcoins and money.
Understand this, world government is not one, can't sell bitcoin in China does not mean I can't sell it in USA.
With Internet, power is in our hand.

"the ultimate killer app may come from a private company instead of open-source." 
Won't work, if it's a company, banks will shut it down immediately and forget about China, they will banned it and bring a tank to the company door and shut it down.
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:16:18
keep adding and you will see large amount of miners dropping out.
When the network reach a difficulty that 3THs miner can only produce 2 cents USD a day.
i would love to see what happens.
Miner producer will not be able to come out PHs miner any time soon for home user.
that will mean, only big company can afford to continue mining.
Be careful about the 51% attack, now thats far more serious that your double spending. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:01:52
Great another decrease, this is perfect for my profit.
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:41:53

Crypto currency wont die off.
crypto currency does = freedom, freedom from banks- creating currency out of thin air.
freedom from debt to banks, which is all a game that central banks play and scam people time and talent.

Right OK. 
I should panic. NOT.

@_date: 2014-04-29 04:10:11
I find this funny.
Can't really tax bitcoin if it stays as bitcoin, converting to AUD.
then they have rights to tax it.
Tax on bitcoin is only for honest few, everyone else, they not going to report it.
which makes it really difficult to tax.
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:04:39
Proof of work Is not the solution either, mining companies can easily control 51% of hashing shares.
This will make far more centralized. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 03:59:37
Hahaha that's a good one, I don't think so.
fully understand where you coming from.
All I'm saying, people likes increase not decrease, since we identify this to be a problem we must fix it
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:31:51
Bitcoin is not without weakness.
things like 51% attack can potentially destroy Bitcoin name.
Bitcoin is the first, does not mean it's the best.
There is many development in altcoins that correct few issues that Bitcoin have.
e.g peercoin using proof of stake to make 51% attack much harder.
altcoins is good for research and development. It could potentially over take Bitcoin, if they develop features and specs that considerably surpass Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:28:10
You absolutely correct on that point.
But China will not be like this forever, China will change over time.
But that will require new government and new system, China will not forever be communist country, eventually they will need to provide freedom to their people.
One of true communist country is north Korea, what's the result?
China knows what freedom can produce, freedom can bring greater wealth to the country, freedom allows expression of people's mind and thoughts.
tang dynasty, is when China had the greatest wealth, when look at the history, tang dynasty is also freedom.
But freedom also needs limits.
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:53:00
Let me say big b nks is a fraud, this is a hard truth.
bitcoin will not take down big banks, this is unrealistic.
crypto currency can take down big banks. When people realize banks is a fraud system and understand the scams behind it and there is a potential system that can replace it.
Watch the firework happen.
laughable, you are saying that way way to early.
It only takes a spark to get the fire going, all you need is to rumor about the bank's don't have money to pay back everyone, in no time that Bank will go bankcrupt.
For big banks, trust of people is important. When no one trust banks and big banks.
Big banks, you can close your doors, this is not impossible.
What goes up must come down, empire rise and empire falls.
it's not necessary to take century to happen and  it's not laughable matter.
BIG BANKS IS NOT INVINCIBLE, ALL IT REQUIRES IS THE REMOVAL OF PEOPLES TRUST AND THAT WILL BE THE END OF BANKS.

This is a great news, we can grab more money.
quickly jump into, hope it will continue to drop.
@_date: 2014-04-19 03:27:35
I'm aware of  that, but this will cause deflation once we reach 21 million.
You must understand human nature, they like big things.
People like increase not decrease.
Once a employer tells their employee, I'm decreasing your salary. 
What is their response? I'm sure it won't be a positive one.
I support bitcoin and crypto currency, but we must also accept, there is limits in the system.
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:33:46
I'm a Chinese, I say China will need to let it go in time, China need to allow freedom to their people.
At the current time, this might not be a wise move, but when time comes China will need to do that.
If crypto currency continues to get adopted in the rest of the world, eventually China will be forced to take it up, or else they will be left behind in the dark.
isolation is harmful, example is north Korea.
