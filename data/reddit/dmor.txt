It's not just luck. If you're not willing to stomach the extreme risk, you should do due diligence and make sure the operators of the exchange are well-known people or backed by serious investors. In fact that's always been the case for any business on the internet...

I know just fine how latency works, having written feed handlers for trading systems myself. The "current price" is, formally, the price for immediate execution. It's a concept that exists at the exchange. What you're talking about is the price shown on a trader's UI. In that case I agree, but you should precise that.
Hacking risks, legal stuff, etc. have nothing to do with the current price of something. Most of that isn't even execution, it's settlement. And "proofs in the physical world", well, I could have said "tomatoes are red" and it would have applied just as well...

Not quite - the spot price is the current best ask (or bid).


An order at last price wouldn't necessarily get you immediate execution.

I'm not sure how we're supposed to understand it when you don't care to give a single sentence to explain your point of view.

The spot price isn't "technically in the past". It's defined by current orders, so it's completely in the present.
