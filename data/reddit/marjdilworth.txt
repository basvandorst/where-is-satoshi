The Internet weakened centralized control over information, and Bitcoin could do the same for money.
This says all.
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:18:46
OpenBazaar provide almost everything so.. this is a option too.

Try with Electrum, it lets you perform Bitcoin transactions without having to download the entire blockchain, making transactions a lot faster. Electrum uses a network of servers to achieve this. Electrum is available for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:24:09
Increase your fee and everything will be fine.
@_date: 2016-04-19 20:58:14
if you use Bitcoin you should download all blockchain, so use wallet on PC or mobile, for example MultiBit or Mycelium for mobile..
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:31:54
They already do more harm, good for them is not an option

Sooner or later this would happened. So much bitcoin in there.
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:08:09
Core has a fixed 1MB limit which will not be changed. The idea being that people pay higher transaction fees, those that can't afford to pay can't use it. Will soon have features where you can send a transaction and then cancel it a few minutes later, a method of stuffing slightly more transactions into the tiny 1MB blocks, and when it all goes wrong, all hail the gods of Lightning and Sidechains.
Classic has a 2MB limit. When that is reached, see Core for what will happen next.

Congrats, give me some as a gift please.
