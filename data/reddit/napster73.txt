Hey Killer, your item  is not true, in fact this very referendum is about making  true.
You see, with  in place, a bank could never loan out more then then the sum of all the deposits. But in the current fractional reserve banking system a bank only needs to keep a fraction in reserve (called the RRR, Reserve Ratio Requirement) and that is like 10&amp; or so. Hence when someone takes out a loan for 1000, the bank can make that loan in case it has that $100 (=10&amp; in deposits. The $900 is truly conjured up out of thin air.  And the bank gets to charge interest on the full $1000. Now, where do those interest dollars come from? They have to be conjured up as well. This is the essential weakness of this reserve system. Credits HAVE to expand to pay of the old loans. And that's why you see CB's around the world so desperately need to make money ever cheaper (lower interest rates) otherwise the loaded spring will uncoil in a massive waves of defaults...
Going with this Vollgeld will have some severe repercussions in case the CB would not conjure any new money. Think it through....
The bank now only has that $100 to give and with many people wanting to borrow it can only give out those 100, and no longer the extra 900. The bank now has to think long and hard about RISK and will pick the idea/person/company with the most likely plan. This means that 'others' will not be able to get the money to work out their dream. It will drive out useless/BS type enterprises out of business which is a plus, it will be great for global warming, but it will also make a lot of people redundant as they can't find the money to pursue. 
Since there is currently no end in sight to this money printing, the show can go on a little longer, but there will come a time the game is up. The rich (asset holders) also benifit from printing more, it's effectively a stealth wealth transfer. It has to end at some point. Better do it sooner than later.

That 90 that gets lend out gets deposited somewhere, that bank can then lend out $81 right? When that 81 gets deposit elsewhere, that bank can lend out 81\*.90=72 dollars.. If you add all these amount 90\+81\+72\+ etc.. you will come exactly to the 900 I mentioned.

This! However I think this is a a GOOD thing, in that case the coins will only flow to useful things, eradicating all waste. The planet would love it!
Not going to happen, the hamster wheel MUST be kept spinning to keep the ponzi going. The brake's on the wheel (interest rates) are lowest ever, just to keep the wheel spinning.
