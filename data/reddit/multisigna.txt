I am the developer of MultiSigna.com. I've built this exchange on my spare time, on weekends basically. At this moment it isn't profitable, but that doesn't concern me since I do not need to pay any staff, only the site hosting. 
As  points out, there is no market. When users see there are a couple of orders they sign out and never come back. 
Users can create orders without having to send me any bitcoins/fiat. All transactions are made between users at the moment the order is accepted. 
Please create orders if you want to buy/sell bitcoins. You'll receive an e-mail when the order is accepted. Only at that moment you'll transfer the bitcoins to the multisig address.
Thank you!

Give us a try, wire transfers are done between users, never to a bank account we control. 
We offer a 0.05 BTC reward on your first successful transaction!

The first market to use multisignature bitcoin addresses!
1) We don’t ever own your fiat money ($/€) (1) 2) We don’t ever own your crypto currency (btc) (2) 1) MULTISIGNA uses exclusively multisignature addresses composed by 3 individual addresses: the buyer’s, the seller’s and the one of MultiSigna. MultiSigna does not store the users private keys.
2) MULTISIGNA does not operate with any associated bank account. The transactions in $/€ take place exclusively between the users bank accounts.

It's very difficult to maintain a site 100% hacker proof. At Multisigna we don't store our user's bitcoins. We create a 2 of 3 Multisig address so even if we get hacked, no bitcoins will be lost. For more info: 
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:52:00
We use 2 of 3 multisignature addresses. Orders are signed by the users when the seller receives the fiat and when the buyer signs the TX to receive the bitcoins. We really think we are the first to implement a complete multisignature exchange where users have complete control of their bitcoins and fiat. Please give us a try in two weeks!

Hello, at MultiSigna we never are in possession of our user's bitcoins. We use 2 of 3 signatures (seller, buyer &amp; ours) to sign a transactions. Normal transactions are signed by the seller &amp; then by the buyer. Tomorrow we will post more information on our site, please follow us twitter.com/multisigna to get updates!
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:02:15
To create an order:
1) Click on the "Create order" button
2) Minimum order is 0.1 BTC
3) At the right of the +/- select box there is a text box where you can type the amount you wish
Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

We use 2-3 multisig as well, but one key is ours and the other two keys are the from the seller &amp; buyer. Both seller &amp; buyer keys are owned by the users. Users use their own keys to sign the transaction and complete the order. Funds are automatically sent to the buyers bitcoin address.
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:19:02
Bitalo is similar, but they create your keys. We do not create your private keys, you decide which bitcoin address you control to use.
@_date: 2015-09-04 18:51:09
We're similar to Coinffeine but using MultiSignature addresses. We'd love to hear your feedback  
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:37:06
Great! Thank you for your feedback!
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:13:57
We'll get in touch with the seller and ask him for this information.
Please email us at multisigna since we check it out more often than Reddit.

FIRST 300 ORDERS GET 0.05 BTC REWARD!
To welcome our users we will give away 0.05 BTC to each user that completes his first order! 
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:00:49
Well we offer 0.05 BTC :) 
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:45:25
Yes, we still have plenty left :)

Our CFO says that a SEPA wire transfer only requires:
- IBAN
- SWIFT/ABA
- Holder
- Fiat Amount
Only normal wire transfers require the full bank and recipient address.
Thank you
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:23:50
As soon as you make your first trade (as low as 0.01 BTC) we'll send you the 0.05 BTC.
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:22:21
BTW we manually changed the deadline to confirm you made the wire transfer until we get feedback from the seller. It's the first order we process from the UK, sorry for this issue.
Thank you
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:19:18
Please let us know if transferwise.com works well with SEPA wire transfers.
@_date: 2015-03-12 17:22:56
Thank you! We have 134 registered users. It's harder than we first thought it would. Very few market orders, we hope our launch promotion helps. We are working on new features. First time helper seems like a great idea, we will sure work on it.
Thank you again for trying our market.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:02:09
Hello, it's a SEPA wire transfer what you need to do. Can your bank do these type of wire transfers?
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:18:08
Try MultiSigna! We will never ask you for privacy-invading questions, we don't own your bitcoins, we don't own your fait. We are a new kind of market, we only need the users, please signup and test us! We are giving away 0.05 BTC for the first 300 completed orders! 
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:41:43
We are a new market that uses 2-3 multisignature created from ours users's addresses (seller, buyer &amp; Multisigna). Our users control their private keys. If we get hacked their bitcoins will remain safe. 
We offer a 0.05 BTC reward for the first 300 orders (minimum BTC order is 0.01 BTC) and no fees until we reach 300 orders.
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:05:12
Beta will end when all 300 users get their 0.05 BTC reward.
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:13:21
This is the old thread  . We will add a new thread today, we hope to explain better how our market works, people seem to find it difficult to understand. Our market requires more understanding on how bitcoin works, but it's definitely more secure than any other exchange out there.
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:06:50
We've just sent the 0.05 BTC bonus to the address 1M7V6UZ9DeGqJR7W3HEgy8For3G3ma4Pnk (TX: 43af0fc30e0b1491e40322e64f69104012be30d6de5860489f9ef9f8dfb45eac)
We're improving MultiSigna with some new features we hope you will like. 
We will try to make our e-mails more clear :)
Thank you for trying our market!
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:51:29
Do you mean Bitcoin Talk? We opened one a month ago. But have made some changes since. We will create a new thread with our launch promotion.
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:48:24
Yes it is, when you register you must select "United States of America"
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:06:06
We are thinking in using TLSNotary, it seems like a great solution, but maybe too complex for some users.
@_date: 2015-02-21 09:58:44
We are a new exchange where we do NOT control your bitcoins / fiat. We use 2-3 Multisignature addresses (Buyer, Seller &amp; our own address) to build a secure transaction. We only intervene when there is a dispute between the buyer and seller. Transactions are signed by the users with their own private keys. Even if we get hacked our user bitcoins will be safe since we do not own them, they are secure in a 2-3 Multisignature address. 
Please give us a try, we offer a launch promotion of 0% trading fees + 0.05 BTC for the first 300 trades.
