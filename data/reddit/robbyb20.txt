Does it matter?  But since you ask, when they released the Democrat emails in an attempt to sway the election.  Youre telling me they didnt get all the dirt on both parties?

I don’t blame you!! Without knowing what the intelligence community does, we won’t either. It’s interesting though that nothing came out regarding Republicans  after Trump asked the Russians to hack th Dems though. Kind of like they are playing to one side to help sway an election. I’d be surprised if no Republican had ever FALLEN (originally called, damn autocorrect) for a phishing scam and they weren’t holding above their heads for cooperation.

Yup!  And good on the unbiased decision to continue to move forward with it.  Lets just hope they dont get him here and then toss it out.  
Having a bias in one direction at one point doesnt mitigate having one in another at a later date which is currently to destabilize the US.  
FYI - I cant comment as fast as Id like as im on a timer.

It has a Russian bias, meaning, PROPAGANDA.  
"information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view."

Why didnt Russia release the Republican Emails?  Why didnt Wiki release them?  You think there arent any?  They arent squeaky clean.
If you dont think there is a bias from Russia/Wiki against Democrats youre being ignorant.

Pot shop in Ballard used to take bitcoin too. Definitely not the first.
