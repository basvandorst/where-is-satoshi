So basically if I logged onto multibit when offline my computer made a new walled and is accessing that?
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:41:32
So, this is really strange, but I opened up my multibit folder and all that's in it is the uninstaller readme files and the shortcut...I tried searching my computer for the other files, but I can't find them
Edit: I found the wallet data file...it was just in a different location
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:45:08
Do I do this from my wallet?
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:07:21
I just tried that...I can get all the way to roaming, but as soon as I open that folder, the only thing inside is intel.
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:29:10
I just tried that and could not find anything...I might try resyncing my wallet and seeing if that helps
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:05:33
I actually tried opening the wallet manually about 30 min ago...there was a file there, but that wallet also contained 0 BTC. I guess I'm going to try to resync after I get back home.

I have a master card credit card so I can't do instant buy.
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:54:51
Thanks a bunch, I'll make sure to re-buy as much as I can after the purchase

If anyone considers bitcoin to be their job...or just wants to try to get bitcoin some national raido recondition, fill out this short form!!!

yeah, I just saw that fee and purchased $20 of overpirce btc (good thing it will be worth more at some point). Do you know how long it takes to register a bank?
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:10:09
yes, yes it is.

There's a 10% off deal on newegg for anything bought in bitcoin before july 22. I heard about the deal 1 day too late to get enough money via coinbase and my purchase costs $950 but I only have .2 BTC
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:38:45
Yeah that's true, it doesn't look like anything big that would make it drop will happen anytime soon (like no pending auction or something like that).
@_date: 2014-07-19 03:14:27
Just wondering, how long does it take to deposit funds?
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:45:48
Good call, I'm just going to cancel it if he ends up paying in the next couple days. 
My friend and I are also trying to come up with ways to "scam" the scammer if you have any suggestions.
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:00:59
Same thing happened to me last night...except via phone call. A robot called my phone and left a message telling me to log on to some random site
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:31:48
I feel ya, I can't mine anything cus I have a laptop too.
@_date: 2014-07-19 02:57:36
ok sweet! Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2014-07-08 17:47:12
yeah I'm from the US. Unfortunately I had to use paypal. But, I need to order a PSU in the near future so I'll get that in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:59:44
That's true, I've always had brand loyalty to Asus. Also, it's a little cheaper than alienware even with the discount because of the Newegg bitcoin discount
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:56:43
Since he hasn't paid yet, do you know if there's any way I can just cancel all together, and let my selling score take a hit?
@_date: 2014-07-19 03:26:14
I meant deposit fiat and get BTC
@_date: 2016-01-13 00:32:59
I plan on winning the lottery and putting 10% of my after-tax money into BTC
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:32:16
Congrats on the car! My beater died this winter, and I had to sell my holdings for a car as well.
 
It sucks not getting a lambo, but sure feels nice that your BTC went to something useful.
@_date: 2015-08-07 15:25:20
Does anyone have any experience with taking surveys from Qualtrics? I'm a poor college student, so I'd love to add to my BTC holdings without spending money I don't have.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:31:18
In cash unfortunately :/ ...also unfortunately it was deposited directly into my student account, so I don't get to touch it...but, it's 7.5 k I don't need to take our a loan for
@_date: 2015-04-19 22:25:33
To the guy on the left: you got this!

Word of mouth for the most part. There was also a Bitcoin speaker that came to campus (shockingly I did not organize it), and I convinced a lot of people to attend. 
I'm on a pretty small campus, so word gets around...apparently a donor interested in economics and technology found out.
@_date: 2015-04-03 01:03:42
I have no idea who the donor was, otherwise I would have.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:22:11
It's given to me in cash, I could screen shot the memo that came with the grant when I get back to my laptop though 
@_date: 2015-10-29 16:49:23
That may be true, but I decided to drink tea instead of coffee today while writing an economics book review...therefore bubble?
@_date: 2015-10-21 16:21:07
Wow, ironic because I'm about to grab lunch with a Deloitte consultant in a few hours...I wonder if he's informed about bitcoin.
