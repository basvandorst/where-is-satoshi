Please correct me if I'm wrong,  but doesn't this solution open up the possibility of a central player having payment streams open to everyone, and charging a tiny fee for quicker transactions off the blockchain... kind of like a bank?  
  
Just curious, I'm still wrapping my head around this.

Shouldn't population increase play a part in this? More people = higher demand?
I mean, theres 3 times the people in the u.s. since 1920.
It still doesn't account for the 20x increase, but i think it should be accounted for.

I gave my brother and step brother 25,000 dogecoins back in 2015.
My brother in law called me freaking out a couple years ago because he lost the wallet and thought they were bitcoins i gave him.
They were still worth $500 back in January 2018 though.

Oh let me count the ways:  
1.) **You're a coward**. Posting a guide on how to attack a dogecoin which *if I'm not mistaken* has done nothing but brought out the very best qualities that digital currency as a whole can provide. Doge4Kids, Doge4Mud, Doge4Water...etc. etc.. But furthermore you're doing it anonymously... If that doesn't scream coward, I don't know what does.    
2.) **You're greedy**. You only care about the value of bitcoin which has plummetted mainly due to the same stupid greed as you're spouting right now (Mt. Gox anyone?). You honestly think dogecoin is the reason bitcoin has fallen to $400's after going from $15 to $1200 in a *year*?  
3.) **You're scared**. You're scared because a coin that's only 4 months old seems to be luring in people you couldn't hope to lure in.  
4.) **You're an idiot**. Dogecoin is Scrypt. Bitcoin is SHA256. But that's not what makes you an idiot. What makes you an idiot is you think that something like this would be positive to bitcoin and digital currencies as a whole.  
5.) **You're no better than a central bank**. That's right. I said it. Banks and governments are so afraid of bitcoin that they're actively passing legislation in many parts of the world **CHINA** to prevent the spread and adoption, and what you said is basically no different. You're threatened by dogecoin and you want bitcoiners to band together and stamp it out.  
  
Is this really what bitcoin represents now!? Wow how you guys have changed.

I remember people buying beanie babies as an investment. $.10 per dogecoin doesn't sound all that unreasonable.  
  
Oh, and if 1 bitcoin were worth $1m and dogecoin was still traded against bitcoin on exchanges.... Then at it's current rate it would be worth a dollar.

Lets say you can't afford a car and take the bus because you're paying $600/mo in rent/mortgage. Now all of a sudden you're paying property tax and home owners insurance and that's it... you can now afford a car.  
Take my situation. I have an autistic son and insurance doesn't cover ABA therapy. ABA therapy sessions are $100 a hour and my rent is $1000/month. If I didn't have to pay rent, that would be 10 hours a month of ABA therapy I could provide for my son.
For some people they view "life changing" as not working, and driving a lambo, but for millions of others it's simply not having to struggle.

I convinced my boss to buy bitcoin back in 2013 telling him that bitcoin was going to go to $1000. He bought 20, then transferred it to Mt. Gox (not my advice lol) almost immediatley before they got hacked. I'm curious if he's going to get them back.

Bankers aren't going to fight it. 
They're going to manipulate bitcoin to acquire most of it.
Then when they have enough, they will create their own shit-coin that's "backed by bitcoin" or "pegged to the USD" like JPMcoin, and they'll be able to efficiently give out loans and acquire more money/power like business as usual.
Why create laws and sway politicians to forcibly take bitcoins when people are willing to trade them for paper fiat that they can freely print and have endless supplies of?
@_date: 2019-03-28 12:26:29
At that point they'll look for an alternative. China? The Euro? .... or how bout bitcoin?

Probably troll, but i'll bite.  
1. Easy transfer of wealth across borders with a minimal fee. You cant send $1m to someone in another country via western union.  
2. Pseudo anonymous... rich people like to avoid taxes.  Bitcoin may be volatile, but it might not later, and with the exception of this month, its been upward for 9 years running.  
3. Its the number one trading pair for all alt coins, and despite your doubts, many of those coins have a wide array of use cases that if successful, will have real world value.  
4.  Governments cant seize bitcoin. Companies have had their assets seized by various governments due to accusations of a crime. That shouldn't happen unless conviction is reached, but it does.  
5.  The USD is the current world reserve currency. China, Russia, India, etc... hate this because the U.S. loves printing money. Its only a matter of time before bad things happen to the dollar. Bitcoin is a hedge against that.  Look a Venezuela. Ask any bitcoin holders from there how they feel about their currency.  
6. For the first time in history, we don't have to trust each other... cause lets face it... humans aren't trustworthy. You trust that the dollar in your pocket is not a fake. If you go to the grocery store and hand the clerk a $20 ... what do they do? They draw on it with a fucking marker! You're going to bullshit us with fud when a merchant has to scribble on a piece of paper with a magic marker to determine if your bill is even real!? Gtfo! 
  
And if its fake; you still get to buy that loaf of bread right? ... wrong! You get to talk with police/secret service!  
  
This would NEVER happen with bitcoin.  
  
I'm sure there are other use cases for bitcoin, but I've already written too much for a cellphone comment, and its getting late.  
  
Bitcoin will or won't be around in 10 years. It could be worth millions,  or zero.  Its very possible that something else replaces bitcoin, but i can tell you that bitcoin has application and value.  
  
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:53:16

We have no clue if its over... it could go to $3000 and we'd still be able to say "hey, its up 100% from this time last year!".

@_date: 2017-05-26 02:49:43
1 satoshi = $0.01 seems to have a nice fit.  
  
1 penny is the smallest denomination in U.S. currency, and at that point, 1 bitcoin would equal $1 million.... which would make counting the decimal places of bitcoin really easy.  
  
People have told me I'm crazy for thinking 1btc = $1million, but I really think it'll happen in our lifetime.  
  
Bitcoin has crashed and risen from the ashes a number of times and every time it emboldens people to think "Don't sell this time, it's always come back before and been worth more in the long run".  
  
That thinking alone will carry bitcoin to $1m.

Contact Cryptsy. That's really all you can do. I had the same thing happen in which I bought 4 times the amount of coin that I wanted and pushed my LTC into the red. 
Had I sold right away I would have made a profit, but I felt it was a glitch and thought it best to leave it alone so Cryptsy could correct the problem. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:30:55
If someone asks you for money, the best thing to do is respond with "sorry man, it's all tied up in bitcoin... cashing it out would be a serious hit to further profits. Think if I gave you 1 bitcoin worth of money @ $700, and by the time you paid me back it was $1,400.... that loan I gave you esentially cost me $700.
If you do however plan on loaning them money, treat them like a bank would (i really hate putting it that way as I hate banks).
Ask them:
1.) What do you need money for?
2.) How much do you need?
3.) How do you plan on paying me back?
etc. etc.
Then write up a contract (will not work if they're under 18).

I would just like to point something out for those that are panicing.
When Napster came out, it first went unnoticed, but quickly caught on.
Then the recording industry started noticing that their bottom line was dropping due to rampant downloading.
Then sue happy lawsuits were thrown around to scare people out of using services like Kazaa and Limewire, bearshare etc etc...
Fast forward, and you have piratesbay, bittorrent, and other file sharing sites STILL out there, and STILL being used.
You also had some awesome products come into focus like Pandora and Spotify. 
Bottom line of what I'm trying to say is that YOU ALL love bitcoin. It's not going away as long as we have people like YOU. Bitcoin may take a different shape, but it's not going away.
Whether it's bitcoin or dogecoin or some other form of cryptocurrency the take away is that the days of credit card fees and banks imposing fees for not having enough money in your bank are limited; and that's what's really important here.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:38:53
