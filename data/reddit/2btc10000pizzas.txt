Not for long.  Over the horizon, we'll be able to very easily atomically swap BTC for LTC.  If I want to send bitcoin, my wallet might, for example, scan the mempools in real time for any atomically-swappable coins, do the swap, do the transfer, swap back, and the recipient has their BTC.
This is still early days.  There are dozens of solutions new applications and innovations just over the horizon.  hodl tight.

When I first started trading bitcoin for alts (just as a tester, not like any substantial amount or anything), I realized how annoying taxes are and that's a major reason I gave it up and just HODL now (biggest reason is because chasing alts takes too much time).

I don't think you *technically* have to pay the fees.  Depending on your setup, your bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum might all be sharing the same master private key...in which case you can *technically* just spend the coin you want, and the others will stay where they are on their respective chains.
Granted, there are no good tools for doing this.  But once atomic swaps are commonly available, it'll be game over.  The flood gates will open, and new use cases will all be nailed down very quickly.

Fees only matter to the sender.  So either your exchange includes a fee when they send you BTC (and probably passes it on to you), or your wallet includes a fee when you send someone else BTC.  
For the former, find an exchange that's trustworthy and doesn't gouge you with fees.  For the latter, find a wallet that has both a good fee-prediction algorithm, AND the ability to set custom fees and replace by fee.  
Core wallet does all of this.  And given the times we're in right now, the best option is probably to look at the mempool yourself and decide your own custom fee.

In general, 2 weeks.  Many wallets have a feature called "Replace By Fee (RBF)" which lets you "re-send" the transaction with a higher fee, effectively replacing the first one in the mem pool.
However, nodes and miners can decide to keep and store as many transactions in the mem pool for as long as they choose to.  Nothing stops a miner from holding onto a TB of mempool transactions, and eventually mining them (as long as they stay valid on the longest chain).
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:15:44
Okay but with Bitcoin when difficulty (or cost to produce) goes down, more miners jump in.  When it's too difficult and they can't make a profit from the demand they leave.  
Also let's remember gold has been around 1300 for a few years, only at 1400 for a few months... Not as easy to turn gold mining operations on and off every 2 weeks.  And not sure where you got that 1k number from.  Mining companies are telling the public it's closer to 1250 in their earnings reports...

Bitcoin literally demonstrates that some data is more valuable than other data.  Many many people preferred faxes to emails for a long time before we figured out how to "secure" emails, in a way that assuaged our fears and gave us the same trust we used to give the USPS.
Hell even 10 years ago when we had webmail, end to end email encryption was pretty freaking difficult and annoying to do even for tech folks.  Now, there are dozens of extensions that just ask for a password within your browser to decrypt an email.
These problems perceived by  will be overcome.  I personally find it easier grabbing my phone, unlocking it, holding it up to a payment terminal and getting a receipt, than I do grabbing my wallet, opening it, finding my credit card, inserting it, waiting for some annoying beeps, removing it, putting it back in my wallet, putting my wallet away, signing one receipt, and receiving another.  Sure, some people will always prefer the plastic over their phones, but I don't think the trend is that *fewer* people will opt toward NFC/QR payments as time goes on...

This is the trap of security.  You try to obfuscate your seed words by mixing them up using some mnemonic in your head.  But you're scared you'll forget so you store the mnemonic somewhere safe, but you need to keep that location secure and now you have 2 locations... then you get hit by a bus.  It's a bad idea.  
If you want more security, use more words.  It's still one physical seed you'll need to store (at minimum, for yourself).  If you don't care about passing on your bitcoins should you lose access to them today, then I'd recommend securing your seed words, all of them, in a few different places so if one place is compromised, you can get your seed from another place.  
If you \*do\* care about passing them on, then for now you need to use a secret sharing scheme, and involve people who you trust will not be able to \*all\* collude to steal your coins when you're alive.  Better options, I hope, should be coming in the next decade on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-07-30 04:57:07
I don't think I understand... Gold producers COULD produce more, but that would be costly.  Human time and effort to produce a unit of gold is higher than any other commodity.  Increased demand is the only incentive gold producers have to spend more in production.  And that incentive is lower than increased demand for other commodities whose production cost is low.
The difficulty of production is what S2F attempts to model.

Well I don't know about that... again this is global and it's only been 10 years (the world wide web is only about 30 years old).  
I think it's relevant because those farmers, if/when they do start using bitcoin, will open up a whole new economy and investment landscape--locally among themselves, and globally for people who want to invest in remote subsistence farming enterprises... for whatever reason...).  
All they need is a cell phone (hardly "extensive infrastructure" at this point, as most of the planet has cell coverage, the scope of that coverage is growing every year, and there are people who dedicate their time to spreading that kind of cheap access to the internet).  If you disagree, look here:  [
But aside from the disconnected folks, there are maybe a billion more people who are actually connected to the internet but haven't encountered the bitcoin part of it (yet).  There are probably a billion more who have actually heard the word bitcoin, but have absolutely no idea what it is (yet).   There are probably a billion more who are online and attentive, but live in places where they're not ALLOWED to read or hear about bitcoin (yet)..........I'm spitballing these numbers but I hope you get my point...

This is it...I think bitcoin CAN be useful for pretty much any human on earth (and probably some machines too).  Whether or not a person will choose or want or need to use it is up to each person to decide (and bitcoin let's them make that decision for the cost of internet, which keeps going down).   
The usefulness of the thing and the willingness of people to use it are definitely two separate things.

We haven't found a scarce physical asset yet that shakes up the S2F so hard.  Currently, there are assets that are hard but have stable S2F, and there are assets that are easy and have crazy S2F.  
Bitcoin is going to be the first asset to be hard AND have a crazy S2F.  So obviously it will break down eventually.  I'm pretty sure it will break down in conjunction with the breakdown of the dollar against which we're comparing.  i.e. it will be the easy money that gets shaken up, not the hard money.

Not sure which post you're replying to, but mine never mentioned low fees and fast transactions as being unimportant, only that they weren't called out at all in the whitepaper (which brought up).  He seemed to think that BCash somehow follows the whitepaper more closely...which is a fallacious argument.
Just because something isn't in the whitepaper doesn't mean it's not a part of bitcoin.  Elliptic Curve math isn't mentioned in the whitepaper, but it's obviously part of bitcoin.  Script language isn't in the whitepaper, but it's obviously part of bitcoin.  The block size isn't in the whitepaper, so the argument that "static 1MB blocks" is somehow further away than "dynamic larger blocks" is incorrect, because the argument works both ways.
It was clear he hadn't actually read the whitepaper, and instead was listening to what other people with pump and dump agendas were telling him, so I wanted to make sure he realized that isn't a good way to get informed.  
P.S. Lightning network prototypes allow for very cheap, nearly instantaneous transactions...what will BCash do to compete?

I agree with you today, but not in a longer timeframe.  Gold has thousands of years of headstart on bitcoin.  10 years is a blip in the history of human money.  We had hard money for thousands of years, and then 100 years ago we decided to throw that concept, that scarce assets are valuable, out the window.  We did it because "gold was too inconvenient; we needed something like paper so people could live their lives with less friction."
That was the trap, and we started printing more paper money and haven't stopped and won't stop anytime soon.  
But now we have a digital scarce asset.  We have a money that has all of the hardness of gold, and all of the convenience of paper/digital fiat money today.  The ONLY thing bitcoin lacks is human experiences, but every day, it gets more and more of them.  I fully believe bitcoin will reverse the stupid mistakes of the 20th century... probably before the end of the 21st century.

Non-mining nodes don't get paid anything or any reward.  Initially, it was assumed that every node would be mining, because mining was easily done on a CPU, and if you don't mine, there's not built-in incentive to run the software.  
Today, some groups argue that *only* miners should be running nodes, because there's no incentive otherwise.  Others are of the mind that running non-mining nodes increases the resilience and decentralization of the network, because collectively, it makes it more difficult for miners to unilaterally to try to change the rules of the network (since all of the other nodes wouldn't accept and forward those blocks).
tl;dr  No, there's no monetary incentive to running a node without mining.  Only the good feelings you'll get because you're helping keep the network decentralized and well populated.

Correct.  The gold standard was an easy money trap.  (credit to Saifedean Ammous for using that phrase in his book The Bitcoin Standard--I highly recommend it.  It's not a difficult read, and if you are interested in Bitcoin, it's essential)  
You can't peg an easy money to a hard money, and expect the producers of the easy money to restrain their production.  WW1 came around and rather than collect taxes to fully fund the war (with the consent of the populace), or end the war when we ran out of money, we decided to print a whole lot more money instead and keep the war going--that's why it's called easy money.  It's easy to produce more of it on a whim.  Hard money like gold is hard to produce.  There's already a very large supply, and adding more than we naturally do each year is very very costly (so producers of gold would only try to mine more if the increased demand was very very high--high enough to offset the cost of the difficulty).  
Now we have a digital scarce hard money.  All the reasons we created paper currencies in the first place (rather than using gold pieces all the time) are solved by Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has all the monetary benefits of gold (scarce, hard to produce, high stock to flow ratio), with none of the drawbacks (they are easy to transfer, difficult to confiscate).  Basically, I believe the easy fiat money era was a bad blip in the money history of humanity.

Go create (mine) a Bitcoin for no cost.  I'll wait.  If you end up spending anything to mine the Bitcoin, then it wasn't created out of thin air.
TRADING bitcoin is not the same thing as CREATING Bitcoin.  To create a Bitcoin, you need to run a miner.  Those cost money.  The more people who complete to create bitcoins, the more it costs for each of them...
1btc equals 1btc.  It's intrinsic value is the cost of the energy expended to create it every 10 minutes, and add it to the most secure Network on the planet.  How many dollars it's worth is irrelevant.  What matters is what did it cost to create (energy) and what can it purchase (about 10kUSD worth of goods or services)

Well, not sure if you typed that wrong, but no.  Capital gains are what you *get* from the change in market value between the time you acquire the asset, and the time you sell the asset for goods or services or fiat.  Capital gains *tax* is the portion of your capital gains that you owe the government for the tax year in which you performed that taxable event.  Being paid in USD does not provide capital gains when you spend them, so no tax needs to be paid at the time you spend them.  The only tax you pay on the USD is income tax.
I guess he may have meant that the federal and the state government will both take a cut of the paycheck when you turn around and spend it, but I assumed he was talking about the cut that they take when you get the paycheck, and the second cut that they take when you spend the paycheck.
(if the cost of the asset goes down and you spend the bitcoin, it's a capital loss, and is tax beneficial assuming you will have received capital gains from other assets)

Oh okay, yeah, obviously, any time an attacker has *access* to run code on your computer, that's a problem.  As much as it's a problem with malware that infects your bitcoin wallets and sends the balance to the attacker, it will be just as much a problem that your LN client will be taken over, and all channels closed out.  If you have channels with the attacker, they can steal your funds.
But obviously, the interface between the LN client and the external applications should be protected with encryption.  So the attacker needs to either break your encryption or replace your executable.  
My point is, unless the attacker has root control of your host and/or a very large sum of money in order to try to crack your encryption, the incentive needs to be really high.  The attack surface is pretty much no different than that of the Bitcoin-Qt reference client.

Nodes can become miners (they would then be generating the next block *and* validating the blocks from other peer nodes).  If a node doesn't mine, it only listens for new blocks, verifies them, stores them, and also relays new transactions to all of it's connected peers.  
The difference is just that extra task of trying to find the next block.

It's safe and a good short term strategy.  But, if you start at $5k, and it triples, you end up with $15k, and then it triples again.  If you took the money out, you would end up with $25k total ($10k profit, $15k invested).  If you left the money invested, you would end up with $45k total, which for a long-term investor is a better option (especially if you keep your stop loss amounts up to date).
One strategy is linear growth (you *add* $10k for every 3x price move), and the other is geometric growth (you 3x for every 3x price move).
Year-over-year, bitcoin is in the green 7 out of 8 years.  For me at least, that trend is worth the increased risk especially since my finances are stable enough to lose all of my crypto and still be able to live my life.  It's a long term investment for me.  I'd rather pay off that car balance in fiat, and hopefully gain an additional $20k in gains over the next few years.
But it's a personal choice for each individual, based on their circumstances and their risk tolerance.

A good rule of thumb is to **always** be prepared to lose all of your cryptos.  If you have that mentality, then you won't have to worry about putting yourself into a position where you would lose your house.  
It doesn't have to be a price crash...you could end up accidentally burning your private keys, or getting hacked, etc.  Or, yes, the price could drop 90% in 24 hours.  But if you didn't invest what you couldn't afford to lose, you'll be fine.

This is partly true.  There was no reason for him to sell *all* of his BTC and replace it *all* with BCH.  He didn't NEED to take his profit; he stayed completely in crypto, but instead of diversifying or hedging his positions, he literally flipped sides and lost out bigtime. 
I personally took the BCH I had and sold half of it right off the bat at about 19%.  I don't particularly like BCH, but I would never sell all of it.  Watched it drop down to 5% and still didn't sell any more.  Now it's back up to 13%...might go higher if fees keep going up, companies keep dropping BTC support, and if LN drags its feet. 
Even if I loved BCH and hated BTC, I would never sell all of my BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:58:35


This is a pretty bold extrapolation, considering the potential disruption that cryptocurrencies represent.  Looking at actual vs. potential this early in the game, and making a future prediction based on that, might not be the right way of looking at it.
I personally used to love paying for stuff with Bitcoin when fees were low and it's value was relatively stable.  Like sending 1 or 2 or 5 dollars to someone across the world was an awesome thing in my mind (especially if that person might have been unbanked--this would give them the ability to reach a global market that they were previously locked out of).  Now, though, it costs 1 dollar to send 1 dollar, and if I choose not to spend it, it will have been worth $10 in a matter of 12 months.  
But it's obviously not going away.  We can't uninvent this.  Fees will go down again, innovation will happen, markets will mature, and the volatility will slowly level out, and at that point, it will be both useful *and* valuable.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:05:21
Not sure which whitepaper you're referring to, but fast transactions, bigger block sizes, and low fees are almost completely absent from the whitepaper Satoshi published.  The only mention of any of those things is in Section 6, Incentives, and the only thing it says is that, as the mining reward goes down, miners network reward will be replaced by user-fees.  
You seem to have bought into the propaganda that some other communities push, without actually verifying those claims.  Bitcoin is all about the ability to verify information, without the need to trust anyone else.  I suggest you take that fundamental principle to heart going forward.
FYI, the whitepaper is available at bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

Well, I would counter that by saying, ignoring your crypto, don't buy a house that you can't afford.  If you think you might be out of work for a year and that means you would end up in foreclosure, you're buying too much house.  
You could always sell some crypto to *avoid* the risk of foreclosure up front, when you purchase the house.  But as the OP said, "don't ever sell ALL of your bitcoin!".  He's right.

Agreed.  Even if you're in it for the long haul, 20-40 years is a looong time for unknown events to occur.  Take some profit and diversify it in other promising, disruptive industries, because at "the end" you don't know whether you'll be at the top or the bottom.

That's a low risk way of doing it.  I put in $1000 between 2012 and 2013.  If I just kept taking profits and keeping my crypto holdings at $1000, I wouldn't have gained *nearly* the amount that I've gained by simply hodling, and taking profit at opportune times...

In this case, it's absolutely more tax efficient.  
USD Scenario:
- Get paid in USD, 
- Pay the income tax, 
- Keep it in cash holdings
- NOT pay ANY more taxes on the withdrawals you make for purchases
Asset scenario:
- Get paid in *any* non-USD asset, 
- Pay the income tax, 
- Keep it in asset holdings
- THEN pay CAP. GAINS. TAX on withdrawals you make for purchases, or purchases directly paid from the asset
Assuming your being paid in the asset you want to hold and pay for goods with, USD have a lower tax liability (that's what I mean by tax-efficient). 
There's obviously other choices, and other factors, but in the spirit of the OPs thread, I assumed he would get paid in BTC, and buy stuff with bitcoin (taxable events), which has a higher tax liability over getting paid in USD, investing in a Roth account, and taking contribution withdrawals throughout the year (non-taxable events)

Not naive at all, and I think the link gave you great perspective.  
But I want to add that "rolling your own" bitcoin library can be a risky endeavor.  Bitcoin Core is the reference library for the protocol.  Everything that's in Bitcoin Core should be considered the gold standard of secure code (it's been battle tested, forked, reused, audited probably more than any other bitcoin library).  It has some of the highest quality cryptographers contributing ideas and code.  
But contributing to Bitcoin Core directly is not simple, so there is definitely a place for custom bitcoin libraries, especially ones that build *on top of* the core libraries, and don't replace/reinvent them.   Things like new proposals that are years away, or layer 2 protocols, are examples of custom scenarios in which some developer(s) needed to write a library for at some point, because one doesn't exist.

Ledger Live is still not very private.  Every time you check your balance, you tell the Ledger servers what all your addresses are (how they're connected), and your IP address.  Better to use Wasabi Wallet or a Personal Electrum Node to check your Ledger Nano balance.   Always use Tor.

I agree.  Back in 2013 I cashed out some, but not all, of my bitcoins to put a down payment on my house.  I could have cashed out all of my bitcoins and owned my house outright, but (since I had access to a low-interest mortgage), I decided that having some of my money invested in an asset that I thought would do better than 3.5% per year was worth taking on some debt.
I also could have held onto all of my coins, moved back in with my family, and today I could buy 4 of my houses, but that's just as much not worth it for my life.  I have no regrets.  I'm happy I sold some, and I'm happy I bought some, and I'm happy with the ratio that I decided on.

It is very common for malware to search for wallets, but it can only access that wallet with it's encryption key.  If you have a strong encryption key, it's costly to try to crack it.  Even if the attacker wants to put up the cost, there's a risk that a strongly encrypted node would also be strongly monitored.  
Wallets get hacked, through bad opsec, key management or whatever, and Bitcoin is still here.  I don't think the issue of "hackers gaining control of keys" will be an LN-killer, anymore than it's the Bitcoin-killer.

Yeah willy bot running rampant on pretty much the only exchange in the world that was worth a damn, that caused the "run-up" in 2013.  I won't even call it a bubble, because a bubble popping in my mind means "game over" for that asset.  Tulip Mania, once it ended, never came back.  That's a bubble.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, which has had multiple "bubble-like" price movements, is more just volatile speculative price discovery.  Every commodity in it's early days has volatile price action, and eventually the market matures and it evens out.  This is only 8 freaking years old.  Give it some time.

No it's pretty straightforward I think...BCash is an alt-fork simply because it's a hard fork away from the original chain.  A user who was running, say, Bitcoin Core 0.13, isn't suddenly running a node for an Alt Bitcoin just because August 1st rolled around.  
The whole "Core is so much further from the original bitcoin" argument is just a wasted argument.  It's the opposite of embracing progress and innovation.  I cringe when I see people appeal to the whitepaper (especially when it's clear they haven't actually read it).

I sold more than half of my bitcoins back in 2013 to put a down payment on my house.  I could have sold all of them and bought my house outright, or I could have sold none of them, and moved back with my family.  The middle ground I picked was perfect.

Alright sure.  Ideas do come out of thin air.  But they take time to develop, time that might have been spent capitalizing in some other way.  Besides, at least for bitcoin, the idea came on the backs of previous people's time and effort to create a digital currency...not exactly out of thin air.  Gold comes from thin air all over the universe sooo......
I don't think you understand where Bitcoins value comes from though.  Gold and bitcoin both cost money to create.  It costs so much money to create new units that supply stays effectively constant while demand increases exponentially through the network effect of usage.  Normally that increased demand would give miners incentives to mine more of the thing, but with Bitcoin (unlike any other money in history including gold), that latter part can't happen.  
With Fiat, that latter part (printing new money easily) happens constantly to finance wars, welfare, basically anything that governments can't collect through legitimate taxation with consent of their citizens.

In the US the lawful thing to do is to report the paycheck as income, and then also report every time it's exchanged for goods, services, or USD as capital gains, so yeah it's double taxation.  If he's not holding onto each paycheck for over 1 year, it's a lot worse.  BUT if his income (paycheck plus capital gains from purchases) doesn't exceed $37k, he only needs to pay tax on the $37k as income...no cap gain tax.
Regardless, it's too complicated.  We're not there yet.  Maybe he'll evade the taxes.  But if his boss reports it to the IRS, any inkling that it's cryptocurrency he's being paid in...boom comes the audit.  
But whatever.  Good luck to him.

The unencrypted private keys are part of a multi-signature contract.  In and of themselves, they can't change the terms of the contract (i.e. the current balances in the channel).
If your LN is compromised, the only thing those private keys are useful for are closing the contract *at the most current agreed balances*.  
The only way a LN channel can have money *taken* by one of the counterparties, is if the other party broadcasts a bad transaction.  And wallets/nodes won't let that happen.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:44:45
This is pretty much true, but it's more complex than he stated it.  Basically each channel has a "timeout" after which the parties can retrieve their funds if your node doesn't cooperate, or goes offline.  The attack comes when your node is stuck in between an attackers 2 nodes.  The attacker can DDoS your node, and effectively send himself money, and empty your channel at the same time.  
The incentive mechanism to prevent this is to set the "timeouts" to a fairly long value, e.g. a week or 2.  This forces the attacker to DDoS your node for a very long time, costing her more.  
It's yet to be seen how the security model around LN will play out.

There's a lot to be said for the network effect, and having the largest share of a social-network ecosystem.  Especially when the technical roadmap is aligned to eat up the 'competing' cryptos in the near future.  Bitcoin is still a small market.  This is still the early-adoption phase, but Bitcoin is definitely the best positioned crypto for tackling the growth in the next 8 years.
Is it worth $15,000 per coin?  No one can answer that, because there's no intrinsic value to base it on.  I guess the cost of mining can be viewed as intrinsic value, but that's it, and it's really shaky ground.

Just to be clear, LN nodes require unencrypted private keys *that are used in multi-sig contracts*.  That means, in every channel, both parties are completely safe from loss of funds, even though they exchange private keys, because they only have partial keys needed for the contract.
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:35:32
That's not how public key cryptography works.  You don't need to provide the IRS with your private keys... You give the IRS your PUBLIC KEY, and then you use your private key privately to sign a message.  The IRS uses your public key to verify you had control of the corresponding private key.  Here, Bitcoin Address = Public Key.
Now the implication is that the IRS now knows your addresses, so they are no  longer private.

No it won't.  Bitcoin technically doesn't need the internet.  It needs people with calculators (offline), and a way to transmit messages, whether that's online, through the phone/SMS, carrier pigeon, radio, satellite, whatever.  
I could technically create a wallet and build a transaction *literally* with a pen and paper, and hand-deliver it to a miner.  
Bitcoin transactions aren't even encrypted, so while an ISP *might* go ahead and block any traffic they see that resembles a bitcoin transaction (a very tiny possibility of them doing this), all you need to do is build a service that lets you encrypt those transactions into smileys, send them through Skype, and decrypt and deliver the transaction to a miner.  If they block Skype, use Facebook.  If they block Facebook, use Wikipedia.

I don't think anyone really thinks we're on track to hit 100k in the next 12 months.  Maybe people think by 2020 we can get there, but even that's stretching it.  
I do agree with you on your main point:  a lot of people seem to be looking at the past 8 months of gains and are extrapolating it out for like 24 more months.  3 things can happen:  The price can keep going up like it has recently for the next 2 or more years, or the price can plateau and stabilize for a couple years, or the price can go down over the next couple years.  Personally, I'm hoping for the second option.

Okay, in the other context then, you're being double taxed by your federal, state, (and local) governments, so really triple taxed (and if you got paid in january 2017 and spent your coins in decemeber 2017, you got hit with STCG taxes also from all 3).  
The original point was that being paid in fiat, and controlling when you buy crypto, is way more tax efficient than being paid in crypto, unless you are immediately selling your paychecks for fiat, in which case, what's the point?

Is this a rhetorical question?  1 BTC would be worth...by definition...whatever people would be willing to give you in order to get 1 of your BTC.  
But it's naive to think there will be "no other currencies"...there will probably be hundreds of thousands of currencies coming and going, some worth nothing, and some worth a lot.  Everything bitcoin wants (i.e. to replace gold and be the common currency) is all to get to the point where our currency (currencies) are ones that people can use freely, globally, without permission from central banks and governments, and without the threat of censorship, without governments devaluing it through inflation, without any of the bullshit we deal with through fiat today.   
If I can buy a book for 0.001 bitcoin today, and next year it only costs 0.0001, and the year after it costs 0.00001, and the year after that it costs 0.000001...that's fine.  That doesn't matter.  If the prices go the other way, that also doesn't matter.  What matters is that anyone in the world can get some bitcoin and buy that book without needing to "ask permission" from the governments.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:05:43
I get all that, and I agree, except for the "trust me, that combination will be worth far more than that right off the bat" claim.  I'm honestly not even sure any of those forks will a.) even go live, b.) be picked up by any exchanges, and c.) be worth more than 1% of bitcoin for more than like..a day.
For example, the Bitcoin Diamond "development team" consists of "EVEY", "007" and "+", and their "operation team" is "The Bitcoin Diamond Foundation".  Their website says it's worth $0.003 BTC, but CoinMarketcap has "futures" trading at half of that.  It forked in November, yet there is no mainnet yet.  And this is arguably the most "professional" of the upcoming forks.  
I'm not saying that people won't load up on coins, because the MSM tells them fork = free money, but eventually people will realize that shitty alt-forks like these upcoming ones aren't worth the time or risk to even bother with.  If someone is sitting on 10BTC $160k USD, then yeah, they *might* think to themselves "I can pick up an extra $1000" through these 3 forks."  Or they might just go "fuck it" and hold onto their coins and move along.
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:07:03
I wouldn't call it zealotry, a large number of people get burned by trusting others with their assets, and the message of bitcoin is really to trust yourself only.  That message is baked into the white paper and the code.  Each node assumes all information it receives is untrustworthy and verifies all of it itself.  People can take whatever measures they want to verify their activities on Bitcoin, even if it means trusting others with their seed words.
People trust banks with their gold because there are not (and probably can't be) good ways to give individuals the power to protect and secure their gold wealth on their own.  With Bitcoin, there absolutely CAN be ways to give individuals that power, at any scale, and we're seeing those solutions emerge in this decade.  
My point is that there is a cost to trusting someone else with your money, and there is a cost of securing it yourself.  We're coming to a point where that latter cost is nearing zero.

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:06:44
I don't think I understand.  The whole point of the security model of the payment channels is that *at any point in time* there is a current, agreed-upon balance between the counterparties.  That's what would be committed to the blockchain if the channel closes.  
There are two ways the current balance can change:  a.) both counterparties mutually and atomically agree on the new balance, or b.) one of the counterparties tries to backtrack on the current balance. 
So the only way a single entity can unilaterally "drain the channel" is if they *convince* their counterparty to do it, or if they *control* their counterparty.  Gaining control isn't easy to do if you use a strong encryption key on your node, regardless of how infected the node host becomes.  Not saying it's impossible, just that it won't be a widespread issue.  Especially if node software enforces strong encryption keys, and users back them up securely.
The hacks you hear about most often are those due to weak opsec, social engineering, or weak encryption.  I'm not saying nodes won't be hacked (people still use "Password1" as their encryption keys for gods sake!).  Just that it won't be common, and in general it won't hurt the network much, if at all.

Most assets (securities) start their life at a valuation that's in line with their actual value.

It's not deflationary.  It's disinflationary.

Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Right.  I understand that.  If an attacker has control of *both* nodes in a channel, they they can drain balance to wherever they want.  
My point is that "gaining control" of a LN node is about as easy and cheap as "gaining control" of an encrypted Bitcoin-Qt wallet, i.e. not very.

You can buy in now, and hope the futures trading is a positive thing for the price, or you can wait until Monday, and hope the futures trading will lead to a dip, and buy then.  There's no way to know how far the dip will go, or if there even will be one.
My gut tells me there are more whales who want to short BTC futures than there are whales who want to bet on Bitcoins success.  It's all temporary though...it's going to the moon eventually

Not "everyone is HODL," otherwise there would be no market (buyers can't buy if no one is selling because "everyone is HODL."
This is basic economics.  Supply and Demand imply an equilibrium at any point in time.  Literally, when the very very very last trade of BTC for USD, that's when we'll have a problem.  At 10k or 100k or 100k million, someone will be willing to sell it.

I logged in and saw a balance.  Had to reset my password to get in (and tried some other emails, which didn't work).   Waiting on the withdrawal.  I won't lie, I'm pretty sure I've never used this site...
Edit:  Well it did pay out (the BTC at least).  Guess I forgot about this site.  It took about 24 hours for the withdrawal to be processed.  It looks like it was a single transaction with a 1sat/byte fee, for all the day's withdrawals.

I did a lot of stuff in 2011 that I "forgot" about over the years (don't get me started on the 100BTC I sent myself, then my wallet failed, and I casually purchased another 100BTC like it was no big deal...really wish I could get that first private key back...).  
Back then I was mining hundreds maybe thousands of bitcoins, so it was easy for me to subconsciously dismiss a "small" amount back then (like when 0.01BTC was worth 30 cents...I've gone back since last years bull run and scooped up some really old change from a few different mining sites I used to use--this one went completely under my radar...
Any other 2011/early 2012 miners you can think of that were fleeting?  I'm pretty sure I left some change on more sites than I was able to reclaim over the past 18 months...

Bitcoin is different from a security; there is no organization whose costs would be affected by the downturn.  Bitcoin is more like gold as a safe-haven store of wealth in that situation.  Comparing the S&amp;P500 high in Oct 2007 and it's low in March 2009, with the performance of gold over that same period (17 months, in USD), S&amp;P  went from $1557 to $683.  Gold went from $764 to $950.  Bitcoin, as we know, wasn't around, but I can't imagine it would perform worse than the USD in this scenario (i.e. people would want to sell their bitcoins for dollars).
Of course, bitcoin has never weathered a severe global economic downturn.  Until it does, we can only guess at the dynamics that will be created by having a new, novel asset class in the mix.

Interesting question, I can answer it 2 ways.  Firstly, my worst place in terms of being plain stupid was on my rooted Android phone, with custom ROMs, and tons of root apps installed, while I was mucking around and trying new roms, backing up my phone, restoring, etc. weekly or sometimes daily.  I've lost a decent amount of (today's) money back then losing keys that had funds I sent to my phone.  Back then, it wasn't much.  I wasn't hacked, but I was careless.
The second worst in terms of overall risk is when I moved to a new house.  I had a 12 word (only) seed printed on an index card, that had a VERY LARGE amount in terms of my net wealth.  This index card was NOT secure in any way for about a month while we settled down, got everything sorted, installed our safe, and generally just had time to breathe.  It was in my car tucked into my visor for some time, then it was just on our kitchen table, later we at least put it in a drawer, but being a new house and people coming over, anyone who knew anything about bitcoins might have been tempted to snag it.  
(I've since moved the funds, split up the new seed, and generally got my shit locked down.  I sleep soundly these days :-)). 
Another story:  Last year I had a good news moment like yours.  I found some really old PC equipment that I'd stored at my parents house from back in 2010.  I'd used it to mine bitcoins.  I had just started in this space and was as careless as I've ever been.  No password, just mining straight into my QT wallet.  Anyway, in the years between then and now, I've gotten wiser, so I data-mined those hard drives and with some quick and dirty (and time consuming) bitwise searching on the disk, I found some private keys, totally unencrypted (remember, no password), with "change" on them.  Suffice to say, it was a nice surprise bonus I got in the middle of last years bull run!  
I try not to dwell on the fact that there might be even more valuable encrypted keys on there that my script missed.  I do keep that old drive and the raw images I created handy, in case I ever decide to dig deeper (or pass them off to someone else)

very possibly, the developers added that feature in order to detect if the OS was modified, and if so, prompt you to restore you wallet (which, as you said, should be backed up prior to receiving any funds).  A modified OS could be a hacked rom, so this feature would serve to prevent a malicious person from getting access to your keys by simply flashing a new rom (which on some phones is dead simple if you have physical access).
FWIW, I'm still looking for my private key that has 100 BTC on it from way back in 2011.  Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck if we screw up; apps that make the user opt-in to security are a recipe for misfortune.  If indeed this is the measure BRD wallet is taking to add security, I'm all for it.   Lesson learned I hope :-)

Decades, plural?  [
The fact that *some* people lost their shirts is irrelevant.  As soon as BTC broke it's ATH around $1300USD, a year-long speculative attack wave commenced.  In the end (as of right now) the price of BTC went from $1300USD to $7750USD.  Whether we continue the bear trend and drop below $1300 or not, it doesn't reverse the fact that there was a speculative attack against fiat last year.

I recently finished Sapiens, and also Homo Deus.  Good reply here.  I think he also brought up the analogy that "money" is "language" in the sense that we use it to communicate value.  And when you view it from that perspective, it makes sense.  
Humans used gold for thousands of years, until we had built an industrial system that supported (relatively) quick communication across the world (when telephones were common and the internet was just being born).  Then we switched to fiat.  Now we're at a point where the internet is common, and new technologies and algorithms are being conceived, so I think we're due for another upheaval in the way we communicate value.

It's not weird.  It's textbook crypto scam.  I don't quite understand what they're asking.  Assuming they want you to send them 0.7 bitcoin before they send you 9.2 bitcoin that you need to pay back in 3 months at 4% interest?  In that case, they would just take your money ($1000s of USD worth of BTC) and walk away.  
Other option is they want you to prove you own 0.72 bitcoin by signing a message with the private key.  In that case, I don't know how they would get anything from you.  
In any case, there's no way in hell they're going to loan you any amount of bitcoin.  Scammers are interested in receiving bitcoin, NEVER sending bitcoin.

1. Bitcoin is a digital scarce asset, like gold, not like fiat dollars.  Scarcity is good for an asset over time.  This gives bitcoin value.
2. Bitcoin is a 2 party system.  Third parties are extra, optional, and often unnecessary.  This means transactions dont need permission and can avoid surveillance, if desired.  This gives bitcoin value. 
3.  Bitcoin is adversarial. Every node assumes every message it receives might be malicious or false, so everything can be, and is, verified from beginning to end at every step.  This philosophy runs deep, and it makes bitcoin very resilient to attacks.  This gives bitcoin value.

Judging by the comment Satoshi put in the genesis block... I suspect Bitcoin was invented to do more than make un-censorable transactions.

Sorry to hear about your family... My suggestions presumed that you can trust the people to whom you're leaving your money, but I get it.
Tamper-evidence doesn't help prevent the actual tampering.  Both of our suggestions are security through obscurity:  one is hiding the keys in cement, another is hiding the keys through distribution.   The keys MUST be able to be joined without your participation, whether before or after you die.  So both options are less than perfect.  
anyway I misunderstood how nLockTime works.  It's "dead" simple!  You give your heirs the signed transactions ready to broadcast, except the nLockTime means those transactions won't be eligible to be mined for some time in the future.  Before then, you just spend them another address and reset.  Upside is there's no third party.  Downsides are your heir will have to wait after you die, and you'd be spamming them while you're alive (but with keys to your estate so...)

If you're a curious type of person, I'd say do it yourself.
I did this over the past 6 months or so.  I got an Rpi 3b+, put Bitcoind in there and let it sync.  Checked on it every so often and after a while I put lnd on there.  Same thing, let it run for a while, then did ElectrumX Server, a personal block explorer btc-rpc-explorer, and most recently, a Joinmarket yield generator script.
Going through all that setup taught me allot and I had to solve some problems along the way (like how to make sure everything starts in order).  I check for upgrades every month or two and honestly I've had like no downtime (that I didn't bring on myself).

If you already have a mnemonic phrase (12 or 24 words, which is BIP39), then you have a seed (which is BIP32) based on that phrase, and an empty-string passphrase.  BIP39 also says you can add a free-text passphrase (like a 25th word) to your mnemonic phrase, and that will effectively generate a brand new BIP32 seed, so a brand new HD wallet.  
The passphrase isn't as strong as a full 24 words, but it is defined in a way that it can be made secure enough for many decades to come.  If you never set up a passphrase, you can do it now and just transfer your funds one by one to the new account.

Because you know otherwise, one runs the risk of dying before the "market" tells them it's a good time to sell.  The "correct" decision isn't about pure math; it's entirely human.  It depends on human desires, the \~100 year human lifespan, social constructs, a lot of humany stuff in addition to just "price go up" math.

On the move, so I assume you mean mobile wallet.  I use electrum mainly.  It's basic, but I like it because it can use a "personal node" as the backend so you never reveal your addresses to any other nodes.  The main Bitcoin app is also a good bet.  Mycelium is alright.  Samourai is great for privacy, but like Electrum, it's best if you use your own backend (called Dojo in the Samourai world).  GreenAddress is cool, but they are "semi-custodial" to allow for recovery (I never personally used this one).
On Desktop, Wasabi Wallet is great.  Bitcoin Core, obviously, as a full node, and then ElectrumX or Electrum PersonalServer on top.  From there, you can point Wasabi, Bitcoin QT, Electrum, and a host of other desktop wallets to your own node, and not worry about leaking any metadata about your accounts.
None of that goes into Lightning enabled apps, which are a whole different can of worms.  :-)

I guess you got the answer at the end there?  It's pretty clear.
Unless this guy had NO shittier assets like USD at the time, which I admit might be possible but it's certainly not common, can you seriously say he made an optimal choice, to hodl the USD and sell the BTC for weed?  To maximize your own best interest, you sell your valuable assets for valuable items or investments, and you sell your worthless assets for consumption goods or thing you dont need or that won't last.  
You should always make optimal decisions when you have options, not just pick one and interpret it as "use it as a currency because currency"...(which is a stupidly shallow thought process btw that stops after one word, definitely made me chuckle)...
Come on you can do better in this community. Teach people how to make good decisions for themselves, don't just stupidly disagree without adding any real analysis.

P2PKH are the largest type of UTXO to have in a txn. That means more sats in fees to spend them since the txn is larger in bytes.  These addresses start with 1.
P2SH are the second largest type of UTXO.  These start with 3.
P2WPKH is the smallest, so the fee to spend those later is the fewest # of sats.  These start with bc1.
Who ever is doing this today is consolidating all of their outputs into the address type that will cost them the highest fees in BTC terms later on.

Cool thanks for pointing this out!  
What are the possible effects of this on the market?  My gut tells me.. the exchange or whatever high-throughput actor it is would only want to consolidate their outputs like that if they expect prices (or avg. real tx fee) to rise in the future?  This level of magnitude of a spike (number of outputs being spammed) hasn't happened earlier in 2019, but it's happening now... So, bullish?
On the other hand, why would they be consolidating a bunch of P2SH outputs into P2PKH outputs if future fees are a concern?  Seems very self-defeating...  so maybe it's just for order or end year bookkeeping.  I don't know.

I'm all for that if there's a net savings involved for me (or maybe not if I really like the merchant), but especially only if no one else gets any fees in the process.

linear charts lose all resolution of past events as soon as there's a big spike at some point in time.  log charts better reflect the past price action of an asset that tends to compound/multiply it's gains over time, rather than add constant amounts over time.  
This chart shows both the linear and logarithmic price history of bitcoin.  It's all about perspective, but when you're looking far into the past, it makes more sense to use a logarithmic scale.  
Anyone who was around before the Gox peak in 2013, and who endured through the bear market and past the 2017 peak... knows how similar the 2015 and 2018 bear markets were in terms of market brutality.  It's easy to see that similarity in a log scale.  Not at all easy to see it in a linear scale (the latter peak dwarfs the resolution of the prior peak and bear market)

Even just the plain old P2P plan, where you periodically give your heir(s) an nLockTime transaction that they can spend in the future, has the big tradeoff that your heirs know the amount of their inheritance before you die, and you have to periodically spend your coins out from under them.
The other P2P option is to set up a dead-mans trigger, that would automatically trigger e.g a transaction to each heirs address if you don't intervene after some period.  The trade-off there is if something goes wrong with it, you won't be able to fix it if you're dead.

A business like a restaurant should have multiple tiers of bitcoin wallets.  Their main wallet should be completely cold, and they can generate receiving addresses over and over so that all of their customer revenue goes directly into the cold storage wallet.  The keys to this wallet should NOT be kept in the restaurant.  They should be stored offsite, in multiple distributed locations, very securely.  They may also be multi-sig, so it takes more than one key to transfer those funds.
Then the restaurant might have a warm wallet.  This is also a cold, airgapped wallet, but the keys are on-premises, and can be used for example to issue refunds to customers, or pay distributors.  
A robber in this scenario could only hope to retrieve the funds in the warm wallet, and only if the employees were willing to divulge the fact that the keys were in the restaurant.  A core point in this scenario is that the robber needed to have a motive for robbing the restaurant, that you didn't explain.  Does the robber KNOW there are bitcoin there?  Does he KNOW how much?  For a physical armed robbery scenario, most likely the robber wouldn't go through the trouble without some prior knowledge about what he might gain from a successful robbery.

No.  In the first few years, you would have been able to use one or all of those computers to mine bitcoin.  The total amount of power dedicated to mining wasn't that high back then, so using a high-end GPU, or earlier, even just a generic CPU, would have worked.  Today, we have 6 years worth of manufactured hardware that was specifically engineered to do only one thing: mine bitcoin faster than anything else can.  That hardware is much more efficient, and there's much more of it running, than the mining of 2012.  
Technically, YES, you can install and run mining software on those devices.  But don't expect to actually receive many bitcoins.  Certainly not enough to cover the cost of electricity needed to run the mining.

This is pretty rough advice.  I don't want my heirs to have to break through cement and rely on Google instructions they may or may not be able to understand, or that they may screw up.  See my other reply in this thread.  I'm pretty sure deadman switches are already possible on chain with CLTV.  
I also think for most people, just using a BIP39 seed phrase that you share (i.e. backup) with your heirs, and a secure passphrase for each heirs account that you keep secret while you're alive so you can spend them at will, is a simple, easy way to do it.

Only what you can afford to lose (although don't expect the price to go to zero anytime soon).  I tend to spend my fiat (while it still has some value) and save my bitcoin (while it's still very undervalued, I'm bullish).  I also spend my bitcoin when that's an option, but I usually replace it asap by trading some fiat into bitcoin at a similar price, so I don't end up kicking myself when the price goes up and I realized I spent the equivalent of $10000 for 2 pizzas.  That's just backasswards!  ;-p
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:16:35
This is the classic blockchain battle... how to cut out the middleman.  The only way to avoid needing a will or a lawyer, to keep it truly P2P between your heir and yourself, is to use bitcoin itself.  But in order to do that, you and your counterparty heir need to agree that bitcoin is involved (but don't need to reveal how much...well, until the end).  
If you can't even establish with your heirs that the Bitcoin Network is going to be used, means you need to agree on another platform, whether it's another less-decentralized non-crypto-related kind of platform, or a more traditional platform like the estate laws carried out through the legal system by a trusted executor.
Either way, if the only people you trust to leave your bitcoin are people who you don't even trust to tell you have any bitcoin... I'd maybe think about leaving those people something else, and instead leave the bitcoin to people who aren't the types that they'd try to steal it in order to get some!!  ;-)

You want to "split" you BCash coins from your original Bitcoin coins.  As soon as you send the original coins to GDAX, you've given up your claim to the BCash coins.  Once the coins are split, though, you are safe to send the original coins to GDAX (just be careful not to send the coins to the wrong chain after you split them).
Google:  "bitcoin cash split electrum" for instructions on how to do that.  
HUGE DISCLAIMER:  if you are told to install some software (e.g. "Electron"), be VERY VERY careful that the software is legitimate.  Verify the source code yourself if you are able to, or if not, find someone you trust to verify the code for you (even for a small fee, it's very important).  That software will be handling your private keys, so you need to be sure it won't use them in nefarious ways.

Hardware wallets are the way to go.  They ensure that your keys remain "disconnected" from the internet at all times (even when plugged in and transacting).  They limit the risk to physical risk, such as that you would take by holding gold or lots of cash in your home.
I use Ledger Nano S.  They are backlogged since the run-up this year, but their product is perfect for me to store my long-term crypto savings (and it supports more that just BTC, such as LTC, ETH, etc.).

These other answers are kind of off point...
For the majority of people, it's as simple as giving your seed phrase out while you're alive to each of your heirs while you're alive (think of it as a trustless, secure backup), and embedding the various passphrases to unlock each account in your will.  You know the passphrases, so you can spend the funds whenever you want.  Your estate planner knows the passphrases, but not the words, and your heirs know the words, but not the passphrases.  There's a little bit of trust involved here, but the law is on your side.
For people who want more trustlessness, a deadman switch can be used by timelocking your funds, and having the onus on you to provide the heartbeat that resets the timelock periodically.  You can also set up a multisig scenario like a 3 of 6, where you keep 3 keys, give 1 to your heir, 1 to your lawyer, and one at a location you are sure \***your lawyer and heir won't both find while you're alive**\*)
edit:  one last thing... be \*serious\* about this.  Trustless Estate Planning isn't going to realistically work for a daily mobile spending wallet; you should be prepared to leave the estate UTXOs alone for years at a time.  And on the other hand your heirs need to know that you might need them to replace their backups at any point if you change your scheme.  If you don't already do this, make sure you are setting up "tiers" of wallets--a small wallet for daily use, a middle wallet for larger purchases, and an "estate"/"inheritance"/"cold-storage" wallet for years- or decades- long savings.

Your right if money actually kept it's value no one would spend or invest, everyone would just keep accumulating capital until they save themselves to death.  
This argument literally makes me laugh when I see it.  People need time and opportunity to fully consider which investments and purchases are the best.  Negative interest rates are a straight up threat that basically consists of:. Spend your money now, we don't care if you spend it unwisely, but if you don't, we'll keep giving some of it to other people who will.  
What you get, what we have today, are malinvestments and capital allocations that are entirely FUBAR.

I'm in the same boat.  Didn't **delete** my wallet, but negligently misplaced the old key file.  Every so often, I visit the blockchain.info page for my old address and think, god I wish I could get those 100 bitcoins into my Ledger Nano!  
Granted, I did go a little nuts when the price started going up this year, and went through every hard drive and memory card I've ever used in the past 7 years, looking to scrounge up some old wallets.

This is why we ALWAYS say to secure your private keys!!  There are much more secure wallet options than blockchain.info when you are dealing with such large amounts.
It's probably more important to mention that 2FA that relies on your phone number is not secure.  Phone numbers can be stolen and transferred very very easily with some basic social engineering, and once someone else controls your phone number, they can access any account that uses that phone number for 2FA.  A better option is Google Authenticator or yubikey or any other physical 2FA device.  Sure you run the risk of losing the device, but you no longer run the risk of having your 2FA remotely compromised without your knowledge.
Also, AS SOON AS YOU LOSE YOUR PHONE, secure all of your accounts!!!  Why in the hell did your friend wait 2 weeks?  If my phone was stolen or lost, I would immediately spend the time to make sure all of my accounts were decoupled from that phone (device and/or phone number).  
This all just seems very sloppy.  Hopefully, your friend learned a very valuable lesson.

Yeah I agree.  On aggregate, that's a different kind of bubble than the tulip bubble or the real estate bubble, which only affected a single asset.  We probably are in a crypto bubble, in the sense that many of the thousands of alts out there will be near worthless when it pops.  
I just can't envision Bitcoin being the loser among all of the other alts in the long run, unless a truly better competitor comes along to replace it.  If one of the existing alts was *truly* better than Bitcoin, it would have replaced it by now.  (Facebook killed Myspace in a very short amount of time, if they had both coexisted for a while, we wouldn't be so quick to say Myspace is dead).  
So unless something *really* new can come along and replace Bitcoin, and give cryptocurrency the adoption boost that Bitcoin hasn't gotten yet, I think it's here to stay.  Especially considering the technical roadmap of Bitcoin.

According to the CPI index?  Terrible example!  
The CPI doesn't measure inflation, it measures "cost of living" for the purpose of determining welfare benefits for people.  The same people who pay the benefits calculate the CPI, so it will naturally under value the actual rate of monetary inflation. 
Example, If the amount of dollars in the world doubled today, the CPI wouldn't be 100%, because then social security payouts would need to be higher.  It'll be much lower than 100%.  But in that case, it makes one wonder where all that extra value came from, doesn't it?

You're close.  
You can use a BIP39 passphrase with your seed words (it's like a 13th or 25th word but it's arbitrary).  Most decent wallets support this.  Electrum for desktop certainly does.  You can give your heirs your seed words, and instruct your lawyer to divulge your passphrase after your death.  Your lawyer can't do shit without the seed words, and your heirs can only access the empty "naked" wallet without the passphrase--the real wallet needs to be re-decrypted using the phrase.  Use a very secure, very random passphrase.
You can also implement a dead mans switch.  Spend a transaction to your heirs, but use Lock Time Verify to make sure it doesn't get spent until some point in the future.  If you're still alive, spend them to yourself to a new address, and then sign a new CLTV transaction, etc.  The problem with this is you're exposing your keys even though you actually intend to hodl those coins to the grave, so I wouldn't go this route.

The best av solution is yourself.  Be careful about what you download, what you run, and what sites you visit and links you click.
Get a hardware wallet.  It ensures that your private key is signing a transaction to the right address for the right amount, and once signed, that signed transaction is the only thing that malware can capture.  It can't be changed at that point without invalidating the transaction and signature.

You're confusing a pyramid scheme, and a ponzi scheme--neither of which describes bitcoin, which is a monetary good. 
Let me help you out.  In a pyramid scheme, people *earn monetary goods* by selling products, and enrolling sub-distributors of those products and earning some of their earnings.  Usually, there is no "bottom" to the pyramid, meaning there isn't any demand for the supply of the product that underlies the operation.  So the only real chance of earning money is through sub-distributing, i.e. growing the pyramid.  
A ponzi scheme involved a guy named Ponzi who would act on behalf of investors.  He would make claims that if you gave him your money, you would get a ridiculous return on that money.  Ponzi would then take your money, *try to get that return on your behalf*, and if you were lucky, he would pay you the promised return whether or not he was able to secure it.  Eventually, when he inevitably runs out of money, he gets nabbed.  
In Bitcoin, there is no product, and no sales--there is only the monetary good, and there is no one who plays the role of Ponzi in Bitcoin, there are only peers.

People think it's going to $50k because, as you concisely put it: math.  A lot of people think Stock to Flow matters.  A lot of people think the scarcity / censorship resistence that bitocin offers has a lot of value against fiat money that loses *at least* 2% of value per year forever.  
People look around and see dozens of countries losing control of their currencies (and in many cases, the dicatorships that enabled those failures).  Some of us think, this can't end well for the rest of this system; others think, it'll never happen here in the US / Europe, we can expand our credit forever.

I typically don't condone that guys type of post, but your question does raise some serious red flags.  You're either (so far) too incompetent to be making investment decisions, or you're deliberately being vague about the details of this scenario.  It's really really basic arithmetic here, so if you're having trouble wrapping your head around performing 2 simple profit calculations, I respectfully suggest you spend at least 80 hours of study in investing basics before you make any more investment decisions.
To answer question:
\- You purchased an amount of BTC for some price 3 months ago
\- Your partner purchased a different amount of BTC 4 months ago.  
\- If her account TODAY has more than your account TODAY, she obviously purchased more BTC than you did.
This is basic logic.

I think they're implying that the ONLY reason we have a CPI estimate is because some authority (in this case, the BLS) needs to decide on a number for "cost of living", so that the government knows what price to peg everyone's welfare check against (any other reason is likely academic).  So *of course* they're going to be "nonpartisan" and *of course* they're using publicly available data...
...except they have a major incentive to undershoot, and save the gov't money on those cost-of-living-based checks, and fool as many people as they can that inflation isn't really a big deal (inflation is, after all, basically a tax, just one that you're led to ignore during tax season).  One of the tools they use as justification is the best possible public data they can find, for the best possible cross-section of products, in the best possible cross-section of demographics, while still appearing "fair"...

Miners that are heavily invested in hardware also have a high long term investment in the whole ecosystem, so they might mine at a loss, but the rest just shut down when the profit falls negative.  Then the difficulty drops and eventually it gets so easy that mining becomes profitable again, so they start back up, difficulty rises, profitability falls, etc. While all of this happens, the network sticks to the 6 blocks an hour rate in average.
Difficulty Adjustment is arguably the most innovative aspect of Bitcoin.  We've had hard money before and we've had digital money too.  But there's never ever in the history of humanity been an asset with an entirely predictable, transparent, and basically immutable inflation schedule.  All other assets have an equilibrium of supply and demand forces; with Bitcoin, the only variable comes from demand forces, supply is fixed.

My first plan for my bitcoin estate plans involved...nothing.  Had I died, it would have taken some act of god for my trusted heirs to retrieve my bitcoins (this was 3 or 4 years ago).  Likely, they would have been forgotten until 2017 when they would have been remembered, but probably "lost" to time after my death.  
When I finally got my shit together, I got some Ledger Nano S hardware wallets and used one of them to set up cold storage for myself.  I used the BIP39 Passphrase feature, using a very secure passphrase with high entropy.  I then gave my trusted heirs a copy of my seed words (minus the passphrase) engraved on titanium so they don't just throw it out.  Without the passphrase, they can't access they keys.  If I pass away, my passphrase will be distributed to my heirs.  (By now 2019, I'm pretty sure they can handle taking over control of the keys with 24 words and a passphrase.  I love how far we've come).
Another one I've thought about, is like a 3 of 6 seed-split, where you keep 3 (so you can spend anytime), 1 goes to your heir, one attached to your will (tied to your death), and one with your lawyer (legally liable for delivering the third key to your heir upon your death).  It's not entirely trustless, but I don't think anything really can be when death is involved, except maybe like a dead-mans switch (a lock time transaction that simply spends your wealth to your heirs if you don't intervene).
Whatever you do--don't leave it to fate!

Revisionist?  What's wrong with that?  It's an economic and social fact about Bitcoin if people are going to ever move most of the world's value back into it.  What I said was entirely forward looking.
People myself included are starting to understand why the BTC chain has value.  It's not about the tech at all really...all the tech was already there.  It's the social and economic that enabled this tech to be useful, meant to fill the void that gold left when the central banks (and Fiat and technology) disconnected the population from the hardest money in the planet (until BTC).  
No other features need a separate blockchain (it's literally supposed to be resource and energy intensive, which is why the world's only needs one (for now)), and no other blockchain is likely to ever catch up to those ends.  CZ PR thing about revising BTC showed everyone where all the mining energy and competition have been going toward.
Also anything that ultimately uses bitcoin for it's security or transparency or whatever, is "on Bitcoin".  Microsoft's Identity project will be "on bitcoin".  The Keybase app is on bitcoin. LN is on Bitcoin. I think we're 100 years away from being able to reliably support the resources needed to secure cheap instantly settled transactions the way BTC does on chain, but I think the world will need a secure reliable hard money much much sooner than that.  And trying to build of all things, payments solutions on a competing blockchain is a disservice to that goal, when we can produce more value quicker if that work went into integrating with BTC.
I'm not saying that no other tokens or networks or blockchains have value.  I'm saying no other networks match the value proposition of BTC.  Certainly not BCH.

Easiest way is to use chrome browser, and download the Ledger Bitcoin extension app.  When you open the app, and plug in the ledger, the app will show you the "wallet" associated with that ledger device.  
It has tabs for Send and Receive.  Coinbase also has pages to Send and Receive.  So on the Ledger app, you go to the Receive tab and it will show you the address you can use to receive coins.  Copy it, go to Coinbase, go to the Send page, and paste the address, set the amount, and click Submit/Send.  Coinbase has a bit of a delay, but in about a minute, you should see the transaction pop up in the Ledger chrome app.
Having 2 Ledger devices with the same key is just like a backup.  It means if I accidentally drive my car over one of them (for example), I can plug the other one in and it will show exactly the same wallet info.  I use 2 x 2 since I keep half of my balance on one set, and the other half of my balance on the other.  (but like I said, they're really just spares that I intend to gift away).

@_date: 2017-11-13 15:24:20
Yes, it only makes sense for miners to spam the network because they can recoup some of their fees (not all of them, since the spammers might have their transactions found by an competing miner).  Technically, you or I or anyone can do it.  In fact, it might be that wealthy parties with an agenda might also be spamming the network, or maybe paying miners to do it.  
The fee market works fine when mining is decentralized.  But with mining centralization, it opens the door for this kind of spam attack.  And it's not all bad...the spam does introduce challenges to the network that we have to deal with.  Obviously, it would be better to deal with network congestion that happens at a normal, organic rate, but it does have to happen eventually.

Weird math there, not sure the analogy is analogous....
Firstly, "percent increase" is completely based on the original price, which is defined as 100%.  So, "a thing goes up 500%" means that the *gains on the original value* equal 500%...e.g. $100 + (5.00*$100) = $600.  
Secondly, "more than *x*" means that any amount that is greater than *x* is valid and true.  So the phrase "I have more than $10" is true...if I have $10.01 or $11, or $1001, or $1000000001.  They're all true.
Thirdly, and most importantly, the formula for computing percentage increase is, simply:  (*latest amount* - *original amount*) / (*original amount*).  Multiply that result by 100 to get a "centennial" percentage value (a 100-based value).

That's the thing.  Stocks all start out with a valuation and go up or down from there.  Usually the initial valuation isn't infinitely lower than the potential valuation, like we have with cryptocurrencies.
Even commodities like gold and oil, didn't start from zero.  
Until we hit the point of equilibrium, these moves are going to "look" parabolic, the same way that when you zoom in to the surface of a sphere, it looks flat.  But fast forward 10-20 years and zoom out, it will look like regular old price discovery.

I chose the Ledger mainly because it was cheaper, looks nicer, and is supposedly architected slightly differently (it keeps the actual private keys on a separate, secure chip, as opposed to the Trezor that only contains one chip).  I still prefer the Ledger Nano S, and highly recommend it.  The Ledger subreddit is always up-to-date and helpful.
As far as using separate wallets for different currencies, that's an option, but not necessary.  I also invest in different currencies, and I have separate wallets, but I split my funds up between 2 ledgers, and then have 2 more ledgers that are clones of the first 2, that I keep with my family.  
That being said, one wallet is entirely sufficient to hold all of your cryptocurrencies.  I have 4 mainly because I think it's cool, and so I can give them away to friends and family when the time is right (I'll probably give 2 of them as holiday gifts this year).
Good luck, and check out for more info!

Hard to say.  Round numbers don't really mean anything in a global market that's traded in different currencies all over the world.  Today's correction happened in the late afternoon in the US after 10k, but 10k means something very different in EUR than USD.  There was no other news.  
Corrections can happen at any time.  Coins just go from weak hands to small hands.  Unless there's a big news event that precipitates a price change, you can be pretty sure it's going to be very short term.

Then we agree.  Although it's programatically the only way...on the main chain.  LN and sidechains should be capable of handling more precise values. Already today some exchanges use additional decimal places and round up when they settle on the main chain.  
By the time 1BTC is $1mil, I don't think we'll need to introduce a fork.  Partly because a penny is already worthless and will be worth even less by that time, and partly because of the above.  Even if a hard fork is needed, that isn't the kind of thing that's likely to cause contention.  It's been talked about before.  It's doable.  If it's becoming necessary everyone will likely be on board.

@_date: 2017-11-19 02:38:37
Firstly, int values are used as the base unit of transactions.  1 satoshi = 1 base unit.  The 8 decimal places is an arbitrary place where the term Bitcoin is defined.  
Secondly, raising the 21mil cap is not going to happen.  It would throw the entire economics of the currency into turmoil.  One of the benefits of bitcoin is that it's disinflationary.  Miners do the work under the premise that coins will be created at a predictable decreasing rate.  Changing that on the fly will not happen.
Thirdly, there are ways to add decimal places using a hard fork, and there are more complicated and difficult ways to add decimal places with a soft fork.  *IF* we get to a point where this becomes a necessity (e.g. sub-satoshi values are economically valuable), the hard- or soft-fork will be how it's addressed.  
Finally--2nd layer solutions will obviate the need for any changes, since they will be able to handle more precise values, without having to modify the base layer.

I have an address that I (used to) own with 100BTC on it.  I know it was mine.  I labeled the address "My Wallet 2" back in early 2011.  At the time, I probably didn't notice missing like $50 worth of bitcoin.  In my search for the keys to that wallet I found some very sad transaction in the triple digits that seemed like nothing at the time.   Freaking SatoshiDice bets that would be worth millions today.  Oh I was also making 2BTC a week mining with my GPU.  My first purchase wasn't @ $20.  It was closer to $1/BTC.  *sigh*
To answer your question, yes, after my stupid period, starting in late 2012, I got smart and started hodling.  Just not nearly the amount that I used to have.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:40:33
Safer...maybe.  I have a ledger nano s and keep my seed words in multiple places (family and various places throughout my home).  The risk of fire or flood or theft is a real one (though it would require a very determined thief and a very very bad fire to get at my safe)
That being said, if you keep your coins on an exchange, you are TRUSTING that exchange.   To not lose the keys, or steal them, or give them to the FBI.  You re trusting them to not ever tell anyone about your transactions or amounts.  You're trusting that when you want to spend them, that the exchange won't be "down for maintenance".  
Maybe thats fine, but historically, a lot of people have gotten very very screwed by giving up control and relying on trusting a larger institution.
Bitcoin gives users a choice.

I don't really need to know the "trough" price, I'm usually happy to buy the dip, and don't stress if the dip then proceeds to go down way further.  It's still more coins I can afford than if I did nothing.
Also, transaction fees.  I started writing a script that would automatically transfer USD from my bank to Coinbase, then to GDAX, then place a likely-to-be-filled limit order so I could avoid fees.  But I got lazy and distracted and never finished it.  Maybe I'll revisit it one day soon.

The only reason to not spend money now is to save it as capital for future production or spending.  The best way to live is to produce something of value to society.  Sometimes, you need to accumulate capital before you can achieve your production goals.  Investing is a risky way to reach your future goal. 
With a sound monetary asset, every person could choose how much risk they are willing to take.  Holding onto the hard money is the near-0 risk option.  Taking on investments in risky ventures is the high risk option with a continuum in the middle.  Currently, we don't have a near-0 risk option.  Every way a person could choose to store their wealth over time, is exposed to some risk by other counter- or third-parties that you can't control.

I found a transaction on blockchain.info that had over 100 bitcoin in it that I got from mining (I found the address in my inbox, searched it, and found the address with a single tx on the explorer, that hadn't moved since early 2011).  
Then, I found an old wallet.dat file that included the single transaction to that address in the history, and I had labeled it "My New Wallet 2".  I nearly had a heart attack when I found that.
I have no idea where that "new wallet 2" file is.  I scooped up about 8 hard drives and dozens of flash drives and SD cards that I've used over the years.  2 of those hard drives are dead (or at least, unusable, but possibly fixable).  I'm still looking through all of the rest, bit-by-bit, literally.
I have found a decent amount of (what used to be) dust though in my search :-)  I'll probably use the dust to try and find a good HDD repair service that I can physically oversee.  
The amount of stress, anxiety, guilt, self-loathing, etc. that I feel about those days is unfathomable.  I actually spoke to a therapist about it because there were (and are) days where I literally can't stop thinking about it!
Anyway, I'm sure others have even worse stories about losing or burning bitcoins forever.  There's the famous story about a HDD with 10k BTC in a landfill somewhere.  I just can't even...

Wasted power is actually what Bitcoin miners try to find... Energy producers that have a surplus of production capacity will sell that extra capacity for cheap to a miner, if it wouldn't otherwise have any demand.
To answer your question, tx fees will pay the miners.  Block reward today = fees + block subsidy.  Reward after 2140 = fees + 0.

The first difference I can think of is that you can create a HW wallet and receive coins without connecting it to the internet (you might be able to do this on a smartphone too, but with a HW wallet you just plug it into the wall and don't worry about it getting hacked).
I'm not sure about the details of BRD wallet, but a quick google search leads me to think that as long as you have your seed backed up (e.g. by writing down and physically securing your seed phrase), you should be able to restore that wallet in any other app that uses a BIP39 key.  (Electrum, Multibit, and probably a dozen others).
IMO just spring for the HW wallet.  I use (a few) Ledger Nano S devices to store my coins.  Very easy to set up and keep updated, and gives me a huge level of peace of mind.

No wallet would let you type in a bad address (i.e. an address that isn't a valid bitcoin address), it would be laughed out of the market immediately.  The odds of mistyping the intended address and it still being a valid address are very very low.  The address format also avoids using characters that can be confused.  For example, you'll never see a lowercase "L" in a bitcoin address, because it looks like a 1.  "O" and "0" are also excluded.

technically, the return is infinite, since the price started at $0.  (Actually I admit, I don't know when the first fiat/BTC transaction took place).
really technically, the return is negative, because at one point, the cost of mining was higher than the cost of trading (so the "price" of a bitcoin was negative, and $8000/-$0.01 = -800000x).

Trading can be fun, but the key is to limit the percentage of your bitcoin that you use to trade.  e.g. if you have 100BTC, only trade with, say, 5 of them, and keep the other 95BTC in cold storage.  
If you end up losing out on your trading...then lesson learned, you lost 5% max.  If you end up gaining through your trades, then move a portion of the profits to cold storage with the other 95BTC.  Don't move the coins out of cold storage for trading...that's a one way street.
Do this for 5-10 years, and then "maybe" you can consider trading a bigger portion of your portfolio.
This is meant for regular joe users who aren't experienced traders (which I think applies to a large portion of the crypto  audience).  I used to do this (I had no experience whatsoever), and it worked out splendidly for me (I ended up getting more bitcoin than I started with, without putting any more fiat into it).  Only downside was it took a lot of my time, and became an obsession, and it can be addictive, and it's a LOT like gambling because this is a unique speculative market, etc.  That's really why I stopped.  
P.S. the numbers are fictional.  I don't have 100BTC.

Average bitcoin users don't know how to send custom transaction amounts, some wallets don't even support it or make it difficult to do.

I didn't mention bubbles popping; I implied that "crash" means game over...e.g. goes to nothing and never comes back.  There are definitely stocks that jump up to $10 a share, and end up either bankrupt, or trading for pennies per share with no hope of recovering those highs.  
Losing 80%, then gaining 1000% over a 3 year period isn't a crash, it's a correction.  Losing 99.9% and never getting anything back, is a crash.

@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:48
IANASurgeon, but my sister is studying to become one.  She's told me more than a few times that she never took a course she considered wasted and if anything, she wishes she had more time to take additional courses.  Not saying her experience is universal, just that some specialized careers benefit from constant collaboration through group course work and lab experience.
I'm a software developer.  I went to undergrad for Computer Science and Mathematics.  I definitely could have studied those topics myself, but the networking opportunities and group learning environment definitely helped speed up my learning and broaden my thinking during those years.  I also feel that I wish I had more time to learn more things in college.  I never stopped trying to learn, and continue to self-teach myself new things on a nearly daily basis.  It's not as effective as those years were.  Again, my experience isn't universal.  
Some systems should change and be more flexible, but I don't think the current system should go away; there should just be more options, and people should be free to (and helped to) find the right one.

If you're a miner and you want to spam the network, you fill your blocks with your own transactions.  You pay fees at a certain level, and recover your own fees as part of the block reward.  This forces legitimate users to pay higher fees than they otherwise would, in order to be included in the block.
So the answer is yes, there is a cost to spamming the network in this way, but by driving the legitimate fees higher, the cost can be recouped.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:40:14
Right.  If they don't include fees in their transactions, the only issue they demonstrate is slow confirmation times.  If they do include fees in their transactions, they demonstrate slow confirmation times AND high fee-per-tx rates.  If they are centralized enough that they can recoup those fees with a high degree of probability (or if they are being subsidized to use this kind of spam attack), they would be more inclined to include the fees and drive up the avg. fee per tx.

Bitcoin-Qt (aka core wallet).  Granted it needs a lot if space and is difficult to secure, but if you work through that challenge, a.) You will have learned a great deal about how to keep information secure, b.) You will be running a full node and helping the network to validate and forward transactions and blocks, and c.) Your wallet will include the base functionality on which every other wallet is built (granted, some of it is hard to get to).  There are ways to connect certain mobile wallets directly to your node.
If you aren't up for that...i would go with Greenbits.
Edit:  I am willing to help anyone who wants to run a full node.  There is a lot to absorb and the tutorials and documentation can be daunting. 
Edit2: didn't realize you asked about mobile wallets.  My advice still stands though for desktops.

Multi factor auth works without biometrics.  What you have, what you know and what you are are the three things that make up multi factor auth.  What I know and what I have are sufficient.   All the extra KYC does nothing to enhance login security.  Unless they store your biometrics.

...BCH is soo fast too... [
...and it's definitely secure and immutable... [
until BCH does something that BTC doesn't already do, if a little differently... it's just a middleman for people who (for whatever dumb reason) want to take their *valuable* BTC and exchange it for "cheap fee" BCH, so they can use the BCH to pay for some good or service.    It's the dumbest value proposition I can imagine having to sell, when we're dealing with bitcoin.  LN and other BTC apps and layers will enable that kind of economy much more easily than BCH ever could (even if BCH didn't have to overcome an 8 year head start by BTC)

Price conveys information about the market, but the supply is fixed and known by all participants at every time point, so it's a non-factor for price.  
Demand is not known, is more susceptible to world influence, and represents a disparity of Truths among different people, in different cultures, markets, etc.  This unknown future is how some traders make money and others lose it.  
So to answer.. yes this and all future halvenings are priced in.  Everyone knows the supply at all times, so supply has no more effect on the price.
No other commodity has this dynamic.  All other physical commodities are a balance of supply and demand changes over time.

He's ***kind of*** right though... kind of........
BTC isn't meant for payments, it's meant for settlement--specifically the kinds of settlements that need the MASSIVE PROOF OF WORK security that the BTC blockchain has.  BTC from the very very beginning was meant to have apps or layers built on top for smaller payments where security isn't as pressing.  Those layers are where micropayments (which BTW will dwarf the number of Visa transactions) become feasible and affordable.  LN, once it gets properly off the ground, will have more than enough security and decentralization to support coffee purchases or maybe a used moped, or a $0.001 USD tip for a good joke I read online ...
Now about BCH... what is it's purpose?  "Payments?"  That's fine and it does have low fees, but it's network is too centralized, small, transparent, and one imagines, too easy to change.  The value proposition of BTC (secure immutability and scarcity forever) is completely lost on BCH...
So in order for BCH to be ACTUALLY useful as a payment medium, people will need to gather their valuable BTC, convert it to BCH, then sell that BCH for some good or service in order to reap those low low fees....  
...that whole middle step is completely pointless.  So like I said... the guy was "kinda right"   ;-)

It's really not.  When you are dealing with a lot of value, then it's better described as "prudent" or "responsible".  
Many people have lost their keys, had them hacked, or had them stolen.  It's not like those things cant happen.  They have happened and they do happen.  Taking steps to avoid that isnt what "paranoia" is.
Hell, I've never been in an automobile accident after driving half a million miles in my life.  I always wear a seat belt.  That's not paranoia, its simple risk reduction.
If you are travelling with $100 million USD in crypto, your risk is much higher than travelling with $100 USD in crypto.  For $100 million, bet your ass I'd memorize that key.  For $100, I'd probably have it on a paper in my wallet.

Forget about the technology...bitcoin could actually work with pens and paper (instead of blockchains on a hard drive), messengers (instead of the internet), and some brain power (instead of mining hardware).  
For cold storage, all you need is a keypair (a private key from which you get a public key that you can share with people).  Private keys are nothing more than random numbers.  The pool of possible numbers, as long as you choose one with enough randomness, makes it computationally infeasible to "guess" someone else's random number in a reasonable amount of time.  
So, pick a random number.  That's it--that's your cold storage.  Don't share that random number with anyone, keep it in your head.  (Actually don't do that--humans are way too bad at picking random things).

The war on drugs is a problem for sure, but getting rid of it is maybe not the best solution.  
Fixing the social/racial imbalance alone would I think help tremendously to reduce the bad effects of the war on drugs.  i.e. if the arrest numbers were forced to match (through policy maybe) or be close to representative of the drug usage rates among the population demographics, The police have 2 options--arrest more white people, or arrest fewer minorities.   They might employ both options, but I have a feeling they'll be more incentivized toward the latter than to the former, given the balance of all of those incentives (social, economic, difficulty of work, community trust, etc).  This would be a net benefit--ideally, fewer incarcerations across the board, so fewer lives and futures impacted.  Decriminalize possession can enhance that benefit.
Take it further and get rid of the ridiculous idea that the DEA should mandate some drugs as more illegal than others.  Procuring and possession the substances shouldn't be illegal; manufacturing and supplying those substances in an unregulated, dangerous, way should be illegal.  Don't stop people from buying or even having certain substances; instead stop them from being able to buy them from shady dangerous sources.  Then go ahead and get the FDA to regulate all of these now-legal substances, and boom, now we're solving a real problem.  No more heronyl floating around (legally at least), but I don't even care if I can get my heroin vape cart just around the corner at the pharmacy--safe knowing that the product is pure and dosages are accurate.
My libertarianism has limits, but still, if the gov't did away the DEA/FDA, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  :-)

I'm a little surprised by your answer.  Nobody even mentioned Trump or dictatorship here.  The lack of a dictatorship is why our government is shut down right now.. We're talking about censorship and since this is we're really talking about money censorship.
But firstly, executive censorship of legally public information.  Since Trump came into office, Freedom of Information Act requests were censored or simply not delivered at a higher rate than ever before.  That's (could partly point to) the Trump admin trying to keep the left-leaning media from digging up dirt (or maybe it's his general disrespect for sharing actual unfiltered facts with the public).  Many of these requests were made years before Trump took office--he is still holding back info with a rigor we haven't seen before (including the "sorry, we can't find what you're looking for" replies).  This is censorship by the Trump Admin.
Secondly, the media censorship you're talking about is mostly aimed at smaller-scale, right-leaning media from what I can tell.  (I'm a liberal, so my typical social media doesn't show me much conservative perspectives on this topic, regardless of my likes, because most of my friends are also liberals--that's also a form of censorship by Facebook, albeit one I totally opt into).
Those right-leaning media outlets had their finances effectively frozen--in many cases for the most bullshitty of bullshit reasons.   Paypal ToS actually makes you agree that Paypal can freeze your funds and NOT have to give you a reason for their actions.  This is money censorship by Paypal, Patreon, Youtube, Facebook etc.  The smaller-scale the organization, the harder this hurts.  Some of the most intelligent and knowledgable people were forced to move on due to this kind of censorship.  (just google, Paypal censorship, and bask in the brazen absurdity of what they do).
So there's 3 important examples, and except for the first one (which beyond the scope of the censorship, isn't anything new with Trump), they aren't getting any better over time, but people are getting more options in terms of communication, so that might offset the censorship problem to some degree.   
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:17:03

There are tons of other legitimate arguments.  What other options would u have to support a news reporting site whose payment channels are censored?  If I wanted to charge a penny per view of some of my content, what are my banking options? 
My point wasn't that existing options aren't sufficient for most cases.  I was trying to say that for the rest of the cases, bitcoin works pretty much perfectly. Until banks stop censoring people who aren't doing anything wrong, and until banks can handle true microtransactions, there will be a demand for bitcoin.  As long as people feel they are being robbed by inflation tax, there will be bitcoin demand.

Okay this is my last shot at trying to help you understand...you're defining inflation/deflation wrong.  Inflation of a money means that the supply of that money is increased; deflation means the supply of money is decreased.   Inflation leads to higher prices and deflation leads to lower prices (all other things being equal), but those are "prices" not "inflation/deflation".
A lot of people use the term "inflation" to refer to prices, but in the context of a bitcoin discussion, it's definitely more appropriate to use it's original meaning:  the increase or decrease in the supply of the money.
Bitcoin is designed to be inflationary forever.  No matter what it's price level is measured in USD or EUR or whatever, the supply of the money will always be increasing (except for burned private keys, but those will become negligible).

But he's right.  There's 99% security if you memorize your key, someone could still torture or threaten you to death for your key.  But if you keep your key on an object, it's much easier to steal or confiscate physically.  If you keep the keys on the cloud, cloud providers can freeze your access to that file in no time, governments with their guns basically just need to ask.  If your encryption is weak, then they can actually get your coins, on top of simply locking you out of them. 
Now that being said,  STRONGLY ENCRYPTING a file with your keys and saving it in the cloud for a day of travel is going to be fine for nearly everyone (especially if you dont give yourself a reputation of being a holder of cryptos).   Just be sure to transfer your wealth into fresh new keys when your safely at your destination.  Take strong security measures in all of your online and offline dealings and you'll be fine.  
The fact that keys are so valuable now leads to a great side effect...it gets everyone thinking about data security in a whole new light.  It's one thing to secure your bank account credentials (where you are insured and can get your money back if those credentials are stolen (maybe)), but securing 24 words worth a million dollars is an entirely different animal!

I don't trade anymore due to the limited nature of time but when I was trading, I was able to grow my bitcoin holdings by about 5-10% per year.  I would keep 95-99% in cold storage and use the rest to go back and forth between alts bitcoin and fiat.  The problem is that it took a HUGE amount of time to learn and stay informed both in technicals and fundamentals that eventually I decided to call it quits. 
But the fact is, if you are willing to invest an amount AND willing to risk a portion if that investment trading, it's certainly possible to reap benefits.  Once I made a decent profit in BTC, off it went into cold storage never to be withdrawn again, and if my hot storage ever were to go to zero, that would have been game over (but that never happened).  Cold storage has to be a one way ticket.  Once you start withdrawing from cold storage, you better just give up.
But like I said, to do it right you need to put many hours per day of your time into it, and know how to read markets and news.  For most people, this isn't feasible.

You're right, I must have forgotten to remove that "edited quote" at the top of my reply and misread it for your original quote. when I came back to my laptop.  (I don't know why, but dark mode makes it easier for me to make that mistake--mixing up adjacent posts).  I'll edit my original post to clarify my arguments.
My main argument was that these agencies aren't "unnecessary", it's that they have flaws that can be addressed (in a better way than simply getting rid of those agencies).   One way is to get rid of drug scheduling and focus on manufacturer and supply chain regulation (to prevent bad suppliers selling bad drugs and killing people).  Another way is to ensure we're not disproportionately incarcerating minorities (which leads to a whole slew of downstream affects to society).
If we do nothing, we're stuck where we are.  If we get rid of the DEA, we'll be stuck with potentially dangerous drugs on the streets more than they already are today.  On the other hand, if we implement changes along the lines of one or both (or more that I won't try to go into), we'll be getting the maximum benefit from those agencies.

Bitcoin is immature, but its stats and fundamentals (except for price) have been growing in a nearly constant positive trend for bitcoin's entire existence.  In a country like this one with 95% unemployment (and apparently, no more remittance payments making it thru to those people)...I'm very skeptical that more than a few users in Zimbabwe are prepared with radio access to the satellites..... 
So I think this is a very bad day for bitcoin!  This is one of those news stories that \*actually\* shows a systemic failure of one of bitcoins main value propositions (I'm not talking about trivial things like theft/fraud--human error, not the fault of bitcoin--or high fees or slow confirmation times--the network statistics put my mind at ease that those fundamental risks will not last very long).  In this scenario, the people in Zimbabwe could maybe deal with higher fees due to this government fuckup, but when the payment infrastructure of your national economy is immediately shut down (and you have no contingency response plan for keeping that infrastructure up at a sufficient level), the fees could be dirt cheap and the transactions instant, but none of that matters).
That being said:  Bitcoin is growing.  Feel free to prove me wrong about how the users in Zimbabwe are working around this.  I look forward to the day (I know it will come) when the people living in emerging markets with (apparently amateur) corrupt governments doing stupid shit in their countries, will be able to prepare an infrastructure for radio broadcasts.   I can't wait to be able to say:  "the worst things could happen but  bitcoin will still work!"   In the meantime, I'm stuck saying:  "the worst things could happen, but \*\*someday\*\* bitcoin will be able to stop all that.  Once I can honestly reverse those responses, then moon.

Look, I never said it was "my definition".  I'm only trying to be clear about what most people *on this sub* think that term means *in the context of bitcoin*.  Context is important.  One of bitcoins main features is it's static, immutable "rate of increase of money supply" which is classically known as the "inflation rate".  When you're discussing bitcoin, and you mention inflation, very few people will immediately think you meant "price".
Again, context is king.  Google "USD inflation" and you'll primarily see results talking about the CPI and the value of a dollar against some basket of goods (never really against another currency though).  Google "Bitcoin inflation" instead, and you'll primarily see results talking about the money supply.  We need to sometimes shift our vocabulary when we talk about certain topics.
Also, I never made any argument about inflation (price or money supply), whether it's good or bad for bitcoin.  But you're definitely incorrect that it can't have infinite growth.  We have over a century to figure out how to add more decimal places.  Once we do that, we can delay the end of bitcoin inflation indefinitely.

I'll run with this...
BTC is currently divisible down to the satoshi, but more precision can be used through layer 2 or an eventual hard fork.  So yes, BTC is infinitely divisible. 
In contrast, gold is only divisible down to the atomic level (beyond which it is no longer gold).  Finite.

fair point.  not really an argument against the usage of bitcoin


really?  go find me $100k USD and then tell me about the "maximum level" of privacy involved in procuring that amount of money through traditional means.
You call out all of these "bad" types of transactions, but that's getting it completely backwards.  I might want to send money to my family without my wife knowing.  Or I might want to buy a gift for her without alerting her to a transaction.  I might want to support a content creator without going through Google or Apple, tipping them off to my financial interests.  
There will always be counterparty risk, but what bitcoin nearly eliminates is third-party risk of snooping or censoring or seizing my money.  If you're happy to trust in the regulators ability to prevent that for 100% of your transactions, then you don't need to use bitcoin.  If you're happy with fiat money, that can be created and devalued by the whims of a small group of people, then you don't need to use bitcoin.  But just because it's at least as useful as fiat cash for all the illegal things you mentioned, doesn't mean it's inherently bad.

Well when you put it like that.... ;-)
But the vertical hierarchy is the BENEFIT in our governments--the people at the top can make quick important decisions that would be impossible for a decentralized system to agree on.  As the pace of our society accelerates, we'll need quicker decisions, and the more decentralized you make a system of human agents, the less effective the decentralized system will be a keeping up with society.   We need that hierarchy!!  It NEEDS to be centralized (...enough to make human decisions quick enough to keep up with the demands of the circumstances surrounding those decisions).
I AM NOT SAYING our government in the US is configured in a good way--it has it's flaws.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, if the humans at the top are incapable of making those time-sensitive, highly-consequential decisions correctly (and almost everyone on the planet fits this incapability category), then the benefits of a centralized hierarchy are totally undermined and negated even.   With good decision makers at the top of the hierarchy, who can effectively keep up with the pace of society, there's no real danger in the government falling apart.

The "last crash" you mentioned was due to Mt.Gox going down (the single largest exchange at the time, they had something like 80% of the trading volume in BTC at the time, so they essentially ruined  the market for bitcoin trading).  Do you really think 80% of the exchange volume will simply disappear in today's market?  I mean BTC-e went down not too long ago, and the market hardly batted an eye at that event.
These days, the things that threaten the price are the politics of scaling, forking, and ICOs.  Yet despite these things, the price keeps rising.  Bitcoin is anti-fragile.  Any kind of "danger" in the space only serves to promote the space to large investors, and in the end, progress still ensues.
I'm not saying the price won't "correct", but I highly doubt we'll see an 80% "crash" like the "last crash" you mentioned (but forgot to mention the dozen or so fairly major correction that have happened between then and now).

Nothing is inherently wrong with day trading, but you need to either a.) be really good at it, put in a lot of time and effort, or b.) treat it like entertainment like casino gambling.  
If you already spend 20 hours a week thinking about intra-day price movements, you're good at math and computer programming, and you wouldn't mind bumping it up to 40 or 60 hours a week, then day trading might be up your alley.  
On the other hand, day trading does extremely little to society, and very very few people derive any joy from thinking about the minutiae of market movements.  I one point early on, I considered myself obsessed with the movement of the price of bitcoin and I was spending maybe an hour a day keeping up with the prices and the news.  I've since toned it back and now I have a free waking hour on most days.  I focus more on the tech news than the prices, except occasionally.  Makes my relationship to bitcoin so much more rewarding.

Cutting and pasting is less safe than typing it in manually.  There are malware programs out there that can hijack your clipboard, detect when you copy a BTC address, change it to a hackers address (one that might be very close to yours with one or a few digits changed) and thats what you end up pasting.  All of that is why I'm extra careful when I'm sending a medium to large transaction.  Stay safe and secure!

What if you end up bumping the fee right before the block it would have been included in anyway?  That's a waste. 
It's not a bad idea, it's designed to find an equilibrium between time to confirm and fee amount, but it should be flexible. One should be able to say, bump the fee every hour that it's not included in a block, or every 6 hours, or every day.  And, bump by 1 sat/byte, or by 3, or by 10.
...or by 0.  It should be the users choice 100%.

There are no fees with GDAX, and once you have funds available in your Coinbase USD wallet, transfers to GDAX are free and instant.  (The downside is having to wait for USD funds to transfer, which is ACH timelines plus some extra, so if waiting is a bad option, the fees might be a better option).
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:39:12
Coinbase has large fees but GDAX (also part of the Coinbase platform) has similar fees to Gemini for market orders, and ZERO fees for limit orders.  You need to keep USD on the exchange to be ready to trade but there are no fees to deposit or withdraw USD to a USD bank account, so as long as you load your fiat 3-5 days in advance, you can get away with zero fee trading.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:45:39
Agreed.  Any private key should be completely offline until it's ready to spend (and by offline, I mean never even touch a device that might EVER connect to the internet, or to another device that might ever connect to the internet, etc.).  Right away, that filters out most wallets and Tails/LiveCD solutions.  The Ledger generates keys on the device itself, so I only need to trust that the ledger won't connect to 4G by itself (it can be plugged into a wall outlet, so you don't have to connect it to a computer while you are creating a wallet).
What would be nice (albeit a pain in the ass) would be if I could prepare a transaction on a Ledger without using an "app".  If I could natively input the transaction parameters into the ledger device itself, and have it output the signed transaction (while it's plugged into a wall outlet), then I could truly ensure that the private key is secure, and I don't have to trust anything but the Ledger device itself.  Aside from that, I need to have some level of trust that the private key can't flow from the Ledger through the cable to my computer.  Granted, I don't feel this is a big risk at all, but it is still a risk.

I bought (and spent and gambled and lost) TONS of bitcoin in the single-to-double digit range.  In the end, I finally figured out that I should hold on to them.  I still have the bitcoins I failed to lose/spend/gamble.  I'd like to claim prescience, but in reality, I just decided to stop f*****g around and see where it goes.  7 years later, here we are.
I was looking through some old wallets when the price started exploding this year and found dozens of SatoshiDice transactions that I had sent in ridiculous amounts (in today's standards)--32, 64, 100BTC **EACH**.  Do I regret it?  Hell yes.  Do I care?  Not really.  What's done is done and that's that.

That's hot storage, unless it's on a windows computer that never connects to a network like the internet. Cold storage is meant to resemble doing the math to generate your private keys with a pen and paper, which obviously can't be infected with malware or hacked remotely.  As soon as you take the result of that math (your private key) and type it into a computer or save it in a computer (that is or can connect to the internet), it can be hacked remotely, therefore it's called hot storage. 
If you are interested, please look at a devu e called Ledger Nano S.  It's a type of device known as a hardware wallet which is designed to keep the "pen and paper" aspect of the private keys away from your internet connected computer, even when its plugged in.

ID challenge aside, Coinbase and GDAX are the same platform, but GDAX has zero fees (for non market orders).  You can xfer USD from your Coinbase USD wallet instantly, place an order near the current market price, and it will most likely get filled shortly thereafter.  This way you avoid the Coinbase fee AND the markup they add to the exchange rate when you purchase.
The downside is that you need to keep USD on Coinbase or it will take 3-5 days to get there, during which time the price may rise significantly (possibly even more than the fee you would have paid for an instant purchase).  Also, there are limits to xfer amounts based on how far you go to verify your identity.

Ditto.  GDAX has basically zero fees if you don't place market orders.  Compare that to the fees they charge on the Coinbase side, PLUS the markup of the current market price, and it might be a better option.
The only way to make it work is to have USD on Coinbase/GDAX already when you are ready to trade.  Otherwise, you need to wait 3-5 days, and in that time the price might rise so much, that you would have been better off paying the fees+markup from Coinbase for an instant transaction.  
But still...it's a good option if you are prepared.

It might not have been worth much at the time.  I "forgot" about a wallet with dozens of bitcoins worth maybe $50 when I bought them.  Later I was able to recover them using pywallet and they were worth a couple thousand.   Had I kept all of them, they would be worth hundreds of thousands today.

I wouldn't hold my breath for this.  I could easily send my BTC to coinbase, and buy something with my shift card.  That's a taxable event, but coinbase has no idea what the cost-basis is.  Even if I had bought BTC on Coinbase, but still sent other coins to Coinbase and made the purchase, Coinbase would have to assume that my cost basis came from the buy order I placed on coinbase, which may be tax-disadvantageous to me (i.e. if my real cost basis was higher, or if the transaction was really a long-term sell vs. a short-term sell at Coinbase)

...just make sure your phone and/or mining machines don't have any malware on them (that might connect to a hacker as soon as it hits the internet, or log your keys and send them at some point in the future once it hits the internet).  
Personally, I'd rather keep my private keys airgapped until I'm ready to spend them.  I generate my keys with a Ledger Nano S plugged into a wall outlet.  In theory, the only way they can be hacked is if someone else in the world can randomly generate those keys, or if some malware steals them as soon as the Ledger is plugged in.  The former is for all intents and purposes impossible, and the latter assumes that Ledger Nanos are insecure.  Since the Nano is all open source, and since no one has ever had coins stolen from a Nano, that option is very very unlikely.
Unfortunately, more than a few people have had coins stolen, just because "I turned on my phone and all of my coins were gone"

Eventually, the digital infrastructure on this planet will support 2MB blocks without batting an eyelash (the same way we can support 16KB of data today without even thinking about it, where 30 years ago, it was a little more difficult).  If Core could objectively determine when that time is, and big-blockers agree on that objective measure, that would be the ideal solution.

The correct tense is:  "transactions **will be** $20".  That may be true, if no one uses Segwit and no layer2 solutions gain adoption, and we *never* increase the blocksize.  Or if the price does a 10x before any of that happens.  Or if adoption spikes immediately.  Then yes, transactions might cost $20.
But none of that stands a chance once the world powers realize that they only need to pressure the top players in order to get what they want, to enact changes that will affect everyone and effectively push out the smaller players.  This is exactly the thing that Bitcoin is meant to prevent.
In time, a block size increase will have more benefits than costs.  The core developers (including the ones who just contribute and don't seek popularity) understand and agree.  At this moment in time, trying to gain adoption, but hurting the ecosystem in the process, is a bad thing.

When I used to trade, I would always look at the monthly, weekly, and daily (and sometimes hourly), to see when they "lined up" so I could make a trade with a high level of confidence that the trade would be to my advantage.  Ignoring black swans, if the chart is telling you to sell on *all* of those timeframes, it's likely going to end up being a good trade.  There isn't any single timeframe you should focus on; you need to focus on all of them.
If you're not *trading*, but you're just *investing* then charts don't really matter.  But you can use them to "buy the dips", in which case, you still need to be looking at the chart from all time frames.

I agree, and I should clarify.  Coinbase uses the "support the longest chain" phrase, but I think they will ultimately end up supporting multiple chains.  As to which one they call "BTC", that's up in the air at the moment.  Since they are a NYA signatory, they may end up calling the Segwit2x chain "BTC", and call the legacy chain "BT1" or "BTC-classic" or something like that.  It would be a dick move, but I wouldn't put it past them (especially since they are still holding their users' BCash funds, long after the price was at a reasonable selling point).
I looked into it after I posted, and realized that the Shift card can be linked to either BTC, ETH, or LTC wallets in Coinbase, so it's likely that users will be able to switch their card between legacy and segwit2x wallets if they choose.  It's not clear as to which wallet the card will be linked to by default after the fork, however.

In 5 years, the core developers will likely be open to raising the block size limit (after they ensure they won't be kicking out smaller users, by doing things like making the sync time faster, reducing bandwidth consumption, etc...things that Jeff Garlic aren't bothering to merge into the S2X fork btw). 
It can wait to be done correctly.  For now, $1 to $2 dollar fees are worth dealing with, if it means our ecosystem can grow, not shrink.  Trying to gain adoption at the expense of losing smaller players in the ecosystem, at this point, does way more harm than good.

right, trust has to enter the equation at some point.  up until now, no one has ever had bitcoins stolen while using a ledger nano, and as long as you're not using a freshly released update, it's most likely fine to trust it.  Honestly, I can't think of a good easy way to perform a purely trustless transaction, short of doing like I described above (craft the raw, signed transaction manually and offline, send it through a core node that you are running yourself).  Even then, you have to trust that code you installed to run the node is safe.

When bad actors arent spamming the network, fees aren't high.  If we were dealing with organic adoption then smart, time-appropriate solutions could also grow organically at the same pace.  Instead we have a situation of forced, fake adoption which takes resources away from (and slows down) organic scaling solutions.  In the name of profit, not progress.
As far as what iks being done, aggregated signatures and lightning networks are going to help.  These may have already been implemented if some groups weren't intent on slowing them down.
Also worth mentioning that the consensus dynamic of the network is being eroded by a group of (less than) 58 organizations, who for whatever reason want to be labeled as "the people you need to pressure if you want to change the network without universal consensus."  This perhaps is the most confusing aspect of this whole debate.

Read that again, carefully this time, then explain what happens when Coinbase loses all of their offline digital currency for whatever reason.  I'll give you a hint, the keyword is offline.
Don't get me wrong, I think the role of Coinbase is great and for some newcomers there is no better service.  I believe they take strong security measures but if only 2% of their crypto are insured, that means you'll get 2% back, and then 98% IOU tokens to be paid back, whenever.

Technically, ASICBOOST is beyond the scope of the whitepaper.  All the whitepaper says is:  "For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing [sic] a nonce in the
block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits."  The algorithm still involves iterating through nonces, it just reduces the amount of work that some of those iteration require by pre-processing some of it.  
...which is fine if all parties are on a level playing field, but because Bitmain is trying to censor it's use from its competitors, it leads to more profits for them, and more centralization on the network.  If there's one thing about the whitepaper that should be taken seriously, it's that equal and fair competition among the miners is ESSENTIAL for eliminating the need for a trusted central third-party.
If I am a miner with the exact same capital as Bitmain, but I am forced to make less profit for doing the same work as Bitmain (either because I can't use their advantage, or I must pay them in order to use their advantage), then Bitmain as a business will grow at a faster rate than me, and I will either go out of business, or become a less significant miner as Bitmain becomes more significant over time.  
This is exactly the kind of thing we should be trying to reverse.

They aren't some shady foreign exchange that's unwilling to work with the US government, ready to drop US customers as soon as the fed applies some heat.  They rely on their customers in the US.
I'm not saying such exchanges don't exist...there are plenty of them.

The intention really doesn't matter...if it did, then the mining algorithm would be implemented such that ASICBOOST wouldn't be possible.  The algorithm is public knowledge and as far as I know the patents haven't been approved.  The patents are the real problem here.  Whether it's labeled a "hack" or an "optimization" is irrelevant; it's a change that no one else will be allowed to use, if the patents are approved.
(Personally, I call it an optimization, because at its core, it's a way to avoid having to perform a hash that you've already performed.  I'm not an expert in the algorithm, but that's my understanding of how ASICBOOST works).

Checking accounts are typically 0% interest, $0 minimum balance, unlimited transactions.  Savings accounts GIVE YOU extra money in the form of interest, at the expense of those convenience factors.
I absolutely do NOT want savings accounts to go away, just as much as I don't want my checking account to limit me to 6 withdrawal transactions a month.  So aside from banks providing a checking account product and a savings account product separately, what would you have them do?  Completely get rid of interest-bearing savings accounts?  Come on....


It's about as unintuitive as paying less for a smaller drink.  Or getting paid less for working fewer hours.  If you want your account balance to grow through interest (i.e. if you want to get paid), it will cost you convenience.  If you want convenience and no fees, it will cost you future interest gains.
I'm not talking about being your own bank here:  for that, Bitcoin is king.  I'm focusing on your argument that banks should only offer one type of account.

Stop using the hard drive right away!  If you're on that same computer right now, shut it down.
Then, remove the hard drive, connect it to a different computer in read-only mode.  From there, you have a bunch of different "data recovery" options.  Search online for programs or applications that can recover lost file systems or lost files.  
When you "delete" a file, the file system doesn't actually delete the data, but instead, marks the location of the old file as "free space" and therefore makes it available to be overwritten by new files.  If no new files are ever saved in that same physical location on the disk, then these recovery programs can possibly restore the file.  If a new file was written to the same physical location, then the file is gone forever.  You see what I'm saying. 
If your file system has a lot of free space, then the odds that your file wasn't overwritten is higher.  If your disk does not have a lot of activity on it, then the odds your file wasn't overwritten is higher.  But if it's a system disk, and it's 95% full for example, the odds go down.  
I also have about 8 HDDs that I need to try this on.  I have a 100BTC address from early 2011 that I forgot about until I found it in my transaction history.  Needless to say, I'm really really angry at myself.  I'm not sure which drive the key is on, or even *if* I can retrieve it.

Coins can be split without replay protection.  It's not easy to do (today), but with some command line skill, it's definitely doable.  The one way I've tried is to wait for the chains to get to a different length, then take advantage of the fact that a transaction on the longer chain won't be valid on the short chain until it catches up (so there's a time window where you can double-spend in order to split the coins).
I assume that if 2018 really becomes the year of the hard forks, such tools will be properly fleshed out and made available to users.

I almost always send a test-transaction before I transfer large amounts.  I've done this hundreds of times, but never once have I lost bitcoins in a transaction by sending it to an incorrect address.  Yet, I still continue to be extra cautious.  Mostly, when I'm sending large transactions, I don't care about how long it will take (I'm used to 3-5 days w/ the legacy banking system anyway), so I just use a really low fee, and apply some patience.  If I'm sending $50USD, I usually just take the chance and don't use a tester-transaction.  Like I said, I have never lost any coins by sending to an incorrect address.  
(That being said...I have lost coins by losing the private keys.  When I found a transaction I sent in early 2011 for 100BTC, and realized I couldn't find the private keys to the recipient wallet, which I KNOW FOR CERTAIN was my wallet...I wanted to punch myself in the face for have such bad foresight  back then!)

Fast-forward to today, if I hadn't sold, and wanted to cash out entirely, I would be able to buy 3 of my house free and clear.  
I'm happy I kept what I did, but I'm totally pissed that I didn't wise up sooner.  Between the down payment, other small purchases, gifts to bring friends onboard, etc. all would have been worth millions today.  Hell, I have some 100+ BTC freaking SatoshiDice bet in my transaction hitstory from one of my wallets way back then.  Goddammit!

What the hell kind of transactions are you sending?  I guess if you're combining hundreds of tiny transactions, then yeah that could happen (but you deserve it for trying to combine hundreds of transactions during peak hours).  


...but those 58 business become targets for manipulation.  You missed the point.  There are hundreds if not thousands of bitcoin-related businesses, not all of which were large enough to be part of the backroom NYA, and not all of which want a chain split (not to mention they might not be technically able to support a chain split), so they will be kicked out of the ecosystem for being small.  That's definitely not what this community needs.  That's what this community strives actively to avoid.


That's why I read posts from both subreddits.  And Twitter (which sometimes has more enlightened discourse).  And the developer Slack channels.  And the Github discussions.  Trust me, this fork is NOT well thought out, and is being led by egotists; the core software (while it does have its share of egotists) is at least taking the right approach of "grow slowly, but correctly".  This is about to be a $1 trillion industry, and yet there are people who think agreeing to a 3 month change that much of the community doesn't want, but that affects everyone, is a good idea.  It's absurdly naive and arrogant.
P.S.  I have yet to pay more than $1 for a transaction (and that was during the giant wave of spam that happened earlier this year).

A non-binding agreement from the Core team to raise the block size limit *if* and *when* it becomes safe and beneficial to do so (judged by objective means) would go a long way.  They have done that so far, except for the objective definition of the circumstances when a block size increase would be warranted.  
The challenge is that the majority of mining pools come from a culture where appearances mean more than actual reality, and admitting that they are wrong about something is worse than actually being wrong.  If there was a way for the developers of Core to show definitively that the mining pools were correct, that would be great.  The only way that would happen is if the block size *does* need to increase, but right now, that's not the case.  It will be eventually, but right now it's not.

Users will come with time.  Businesses and people who provide the infrastructure if the ecosystem are who we need to focus on adding right now.  Trying to add users (by temporarily lowering fees) but making it harder for smaller businesses to stay in the ecosystem or even to enter the ecosystem is risky proposition at best.  
The reason the developers of core want to wait is because the risk doesn't outweigh the benefit and will dig the system into a hole that we migh t not be able to climb out of later on.  Adoption can grow slowly and in line with the innovation, or we can try to force adoption to grow quickly, by sacrificing innovation (and by pushing the ecosystem toward centralization) as long as we treust that the bug players can keep up and that they know what they are doing.
If you've been following the Slack, Github, and the mailing lists, you know that trust would be misplaced (Aside from being entirely antithetical to what bitcoin is about).

Turn your computer off right now and get a different one running where you can try recovery.  The more you use your computer, the less chance you can get your wallet back. 
Plug your old disk in and mount it read only.  Take an image of the disk.  Then try using pywallet which has a recovery option.  This tool will scan your disk sector by sector looking for bits that might possibly be your private keys.  If it funds them it can create a new wallet.dat file for you and you can send your coins to a new secure wallet.
Google pywallet recovery.

It makes assumptions...which are true.  It assumes some calculations would be redundant, because they sometimes are.  And if they are, why compute them all over again?  Instead, they get computed once and the results get stored, so that if/when that computation comes up again, the result is already available.   There's nothing wrong with that; what's wrong is to try to ensure that only you can take advantage of that fact, even though the fact applies to everyone.
Bitmain basically says:  "someone found a way to avoid having to perform duplicate computations, so we are going to take advantage of that, but you need to keep recomputing that computation because I don't want you to benefit from it".
It's as if I found a way to compress data better, which absolutely works, and I make that knowledge available to the world.  Then Netflix comes along and says, we're going to use that compression, but Hulu and Youtube and everyone else can't use it because it gives us an advantage we don't want them to have.  The only thing wrong is that Netflix tries to stifle their competitors, not the fact that they are using the compression.

Agreed with this assessment.  We are in a situation where miners, in their quest for more power, are trying to also be developers, and by becoming miner-developers, they are also trying to use whatever influence they have to drive users toward their goals.  In essence, they want to control all 3 groups (mining, developing, and, through media, user actions).  
The scary thing is that many users don't realize how much power they hold, and will in fact follow what others tell them to do.  That's not what bitcoin is about, but a lot of people still fall into that habit of listening to other people, and deciding what to do based on what those other people say (even if those other people suggest disadvantageous things).  Miners/Big Blockers are counting on this dynamic working to their advantage, and to a large extent, they may be right.  I mean we live in a time where the US President can do his job without knowing anything about it, and can say and do things that most decent people wouldn't do, but still be in his position because he knows how to control the media.  Miner-developers wan't to be like him.
On the other hand, Miner-Developers tend to be clowns compared to the competency of Core developers (and by Core developers, I'm not just talking about Luke, Peter, and the big names, but I'm talking about the hundreds of other open source developers who are involved with helping to build the Bitcoin Core software...a base which the Miner-Developers don't have on their side, and will likely never get if they keep up with what they are doing these days)

Wallets send transactions only. They don't verify anything (typically they ask a TRUSTED SERVER for transaction history to show in the wallet)
Nodes (full nodes) receive unconfirmed transactions, verify them, add them to the mempool, and propogate them to the rest of the network.  They also receive newly mined blocks and verify those and propogate them to the network as well.  Full nodes can choose to act as wallets or not.  If they do, the TRUSTED SERVER is itself, its own node.
Miners are nodes that take transactions they've added to the mempool, and expend energy creating blocks filled with those transactions, before sending the solved block to the network and moving to the next one.
It's not complicated.  :Wink:

Maybe I'm paranoid, but I check every character...twice.  I've read before about clipboard malware that can detect a potential bitcoin address, and modify it before you paste it, so you end up pasting the malicious address instead of the address you intended to copy.  Even more, they claimed that the first and last digits could be made to be the same, while some digits in the middle could be modified, so the hackers address might be similar to the intended address, except for a few characters in the middle (not sure how valid this is).
Anyway, what I took from that claim was that it's worth the extra 30 seconds of my time to compare the addresses, every character, once or twice before hitting send.  It's really not that hard.  And it takes very little time.  And it's not a big deal, it's just being safe.
Now, all of that being said, I have NEVER sent bitcoins to an incorrect address.  It just never happened.  Every address I've copied and pasted has worked out fine.  Every address I pulled from a QR code has worked out fine.  Every address I typed manually has worked out fine.  I've done this thousands of times, I've never had a problem.  In hindsight, those extra checks might have been unnecessary.  But in reality, it only takes one screw up for all of those extra checks to have been worth it.  Hopefully, that never happens.

Do you have a stop loss point in mind, or would you continue to hold/accumulate if the price were to tank to, say, $100USD?  e.g. If something irreversibly bad were to happen in the space like private keys being cracked, or miners actively attacking the network, at what point on the ride down would you realize your gains?
P.S. I'm bullish and don't think this would happen.  I realize that black swan events like that would likely be handled in some novel way, but speaking hypothetically, if private keys were cracked, and the price fell 20%, that would most likely be my cash-out point (unless a novel solution was proposed that I could get on board with).

Okay, yeah, I think we agree then.  :-)
They are trying to influence the data format *politically*, not technically.  They are in it for profits only, not for technological or philosophical reasons.  More profits today (relative to the profits of a competing miner with identical capital working with identical inputs) means that over time, their advantage will grow.  Their competitors relevance will shrink, and miner centralization will be the result.  ASICBOOST itself isn't bad; I would say in the absence of segwit and their pending patents, it's actually a good thing technologically.  It's bad when they use ASICBOOST patents as a tool to censor their competition, and it's worse when they use ASICBOOST as a tool to argue against innovation on the network.

Multi-sig is a great option, but it requires trust in other parties, or extra logistics if you control all of the keys but keep them geographically separate.  If you need to transfer coins in a pinch, you might be out of luck if your keys are in multiple places.
If you don't trust yourself to keep an offline private key secure, then you can use an m-of-n multi-sig wallet.  On the one hand, you have easy-access, but physical security is required; on the other, you can lose or have stolen &lt;*m* keys, but it takes *m* keys to spend, so they are easy to store physically, but less easy to access.

I think part of it is that they *know how to do it* but they *aren't as excited about it as I am.*  A lot of people I've turned on to bitcoin are only..."initialized" to the concept, but not "fully engaged" like I and probably everyone on this sub are.

I see.  You're just against banking in general, and used the checking/savings thing as one example.   We live in a (mostly) capitalist global economy.  No self-interested bank would choose to give their highest level of interest AND their highest level of convenience.   Same reason that McDonalds doesn't offer all of their different sizes of soft drinks at the same price.   Businesses simply don't do that--they work to maximize their profits, either now or in the future.  Cryptocurrency won't be any different.  If all the major fiat banks fail, new crpyto-banks will come up in their place, but they won't be the altruistic, non-profit banks you're imagining.  They'll use the same marketing and sales tactics as the fiat banks, because those tactics are proven to grow the banks profits, regardless of what currency they're dealing with.  


This makes me laugh.  A world without banks, loans, or ***security***? Where everyone keeps their cash and crypto under their mattress, and all financials are done P2P or decentralized?  Come on...even if that were a plausible outcome for global finance, it's centuries away.  People will always need security for their money, and they will always be willing to pay others to provide that security.  If you really believe that 9 billion people are suddenly (or even gradually) going to get woke and become their own bank, you can keep dreaming.

...really?  nothing?  there are server and infrastructure costs, energy costs, and human costs.  Banks don't just provide a "free" service and charge you for it.  They aren't NPOs.  You can argue that they provide a "cheap" service and over-charge you for it, but that's their prerogative.  If you don't like it, don't use banks (and give up your interest gains).


Cryptocurrency isn't some silver bullet that will undo the fundamental features of our economy.  As long as people are willing to give control of their keys to a bank (or a "custodian"), and that custodian is taking deposits from multiple parties and providing loans, fractional reserve banking is possible.  It doesn't matter if the bank is dealing with USD, BTC private keys, tulip bulbs, or anything else.  Taking deposits + providing loans = fractional reserve.  
Loans will never go away.  New startup businesses will always need loans.  Regular consumers will always need loans (for unplanned emergencies as one example).  


I call it security.  If my bank branch burns down in a fire, my checking account balance won't suddenly show up at $0.  But if I didn't trust someone else to secure my money, and stored all of my cash in my house, and my house burned down, I'd be SOL.  Sure, it's security through insurance (a non-zero cost to the banks business, btw).  It doesn't really matter.  People will need loans, therefore banks will exist.  If they can exist without insurance and fraud that's better, but they will never cease to exist as long as people need money now that they can pay back later.

It's more like a legitimate incentive.  They want profits, asicboost increases their profits, patenting asicboost increases their profits even more (and over time, leads to miner centralization as their competitors become less and less relevant due to their disadvantage).  
Segwit reduces their profits.  
I don't think asicboost is bad (the whitepaper says to increment the nonce until the solution is found, it doesn't say, to repeat identical work within a block when there is a way to effectively prevent such repetition); I do think that Jihan trying to censor it's use among his competitors, is bad.  He does it for short-term profit, disregarding the potential long-term damage that would be caused when Bitcoin starts to rely on a trusted third party (his company) for almost all mining work on the network.

The mempool was completely cleared yesterday.  If you are not in a hurry (which, I assume you can afford to wait a few hours if you're using a hardware wallet), then set a low custom fee and just wait.  Worst case: your transaction is rejected after some time and will be returned, Best case: you get lucky and your transaction is picked up quickly, Probable case:  it'll take a few hours but it will go through.
Also, it's best to send your transactions to a single address in your hardware wallet, to avoid the scenario you have now (too many addresses with a small amount).  The fee is a function of the size of the transaction, which depends on the number of inputs and outputs.  Most likely, you have one or two outputs (one to the recipient address, and maybe another one for leftover change unless you are sending the whole balance).  So an ideal transaction is one-input to one-output (e.g. the entire balance of a single address going to a recipient address).  A less ideal transaction is, for example, sending 1 BTC to a recipient, but that 1BTC is coming from 100 inputs of 0.01 BTC each.

You gained 100% of an asset that gained 500% against the USD, and you didn't think...hmm, I should realize some of those gains (in BTC), just in case things go bad in the future?  Good move, mate.  Silver lining is that if you ever do start trading again, you'll understand that it's not about chasing gains, it's about *managing risk* so that everything you do is to your advantage.
I used to trade alts, and I had a rule...once I put bitcoin in cold storage, I don't take it out again.  I would rebalance some of my trading btc into cold storage when my trading coins became more than 5-10% of all my coins.  Once my trading coins hit 0, that would have been game over.  
In the end, game over was just me getting lazy and not wanting to spend any more time with it.  Much better to live my life and have more free time while hodling BTC than spending time researching, watching, stressing, etc.  It wasn't for me.  Sounds like it's not for you either.

To clarify:  
Coinbase is insured *for USD balances* that are stored on your account (which are actually stored in a regular custodial bank account which is FDIC insured like any other bank account).  
Coinbase is insured *for online cryptocurrencies* that are stored in hot wallets.  This accounts for about 5% of all of their cryptocurrency assets.
Coinbase is NOT INSURED *for offline cryptocurrencies* stored in cold storage.  If their cold storage funds are lost, they will have to repay us from their own capital, which may take a long time.  Granted, their cold storage solutions are likely the most secure in the industry (we're not just talking about a few multi-sig hardware wallets here, theirs is likely on a whole different level).  It would probably take some massive social engineering, or a LOT of really disgruntled employees for their cold storage to be comprimised.  So its easy to imagine that given a choice of spending capital on insurance for their cold-storage funds, vs spending the same amount on legit security of their cold-storage funds, that they would want to go with the latter, and pour money into security over time.
TL;DR Coinbase is "secure enough" for "most people", and like another commenter said, when you want to take control and be your own bank, nothing can stop you.

FTFY.  
I really don't understand your arguments.  I think you're suggesting that banks should stop offering savings/checking accounts, and instead consolidate them into a single "account".  That would be good for the bank, and bad for the customers (as the bank thinks:  "hmm, should we offer 0% (checking rate) on the new accounts or 2% (savings rate)?  Tough Decision...")
It's really not difficult to understand, even for young millenials.  Savings = higher-interest/more-restrictions.  Checking = low/no interest and fewer/no restrictions.  Literally the only people who care about the fact that these accounts are implemented the same way are the systems engineers at the banks (and you, I guess).
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:51:01
 is explaining it correctly.  You are interweaving true statements with false statements.  
"A hash function, by definition, works with *arbitrary* data" is a true statement.  "A valid hash function does not care what the input data looks like" is a true statement.  
"ASICBOOST...cares what the input data looks like, or it breaks their optimization"...is a partially true statement.
"If they require the input data to be in a specific format, then it is not really a full SHA256 implementation" is true.....but starting to show some misunderstanding.
ASICBOOST is *not* a full SHA256 implementation.  Rather, it's a set of intermediate steps in the algorithm that *is* the full SHA256 implementation.  It's not the function itself; it's a few lines of code within the function.  
It's meant to reduce the time to compute the result if the input is organized a certain way.  If the input is organized in a beneficial way, the function requires less work; if the input is organized in a non-beneficial way, the function requires more work.  The input can be arbitrary, and the function will still return the same result every time for a given input.  But **if** the input data is organized in a beneficial way, **then** the time to compute the result will be reduced.  
The data doesn't HAVE TO BE organized beneficially.  But if you are given an input value that happens to be organized beneficially, then a SHA256 hash function that incorporates ASICBOOST will find the result faster than a SHA256 hash function that doesn't.  They will both find the same result, every time, given the same input, but ASICBOOST will return the result faster *most of the time*.
Segwit essentially removes the "beneficial" format that the ASICBOOST steps are able to take advantage of.  It puts an ASICBOOST SHA256 hash function on the same playing field as a non-ASICBOOST SHA256 hash function, so that they will find the result in the same amount of time.  
They will *still always* find the same result given the same input.  Nobody *cares* what format the input is in, except those who are interested in finding the SHA256 result faster.

If you can get cheap electricity, you can start mining bitcoin.    
I'll get shit on for posting this, but I use Hashnest for cloud mining.  I've already made back my initial investment (in BTC, not in USD which have far surpassed my initial investment), so every day I make a small amount of BTC at no cost (except the risk that they go under).  I know Bitmain is evil, and I have no intention of ever sending them any more of anything ever, but hey, they paid me about 2 BTC over the years for 1.2 BTC I put in, so as long as they keep paying me miner payouts...why would I stop?  It's worth mentioning that it took years to recoup my initial investment, and there's no guarantee that new investments they get today will ever get 100% of the BTC back...

I went through this scenario, and it seems to work.  As far as I can tell, the only risk with this method is if the BTC blockchain catches up to the S2X blockchain between the time you send the S2X transaction, and the time you send the BTC transaction (once the S2X transaction is confirmed).  
One question, is the idea that in the real scenario, I would have 2 nodes running: one on the original chain, that's connected to the BTC network, that will "receive" my BTC transaction, and an entirely separate one connected to the S2X network, that would "receive" my S2X transaction?  
Also, are there any other risks that I'm not thinking of?  Is it possible someone could create a bot to do this automatically for *any* transaction it sees on either chains network?

With Shamir Secret Sharing, you can split the master key up so that you need some (or maybe all) of the pieces to reconstruct the key.  If you split it out into 100 pieces of which 20 are needed to reconstruct the key, and distribute them to 100 friends, you still need to trust that they won't work to team up and find a group of 20 willing to screw you over.  If you do it such that you need all 100 to reconstruct the key, you need to trust that none of your friends will ever lose their part of the key, or be out of range when you need to retrieve it.  
The safety of your keys depends (like many things in bitcoin) on the trust you put in the people to whom you entrust the parts of the key.

how can it be an attempt to pay less?  Salary is just money paid to you over time.  Paying by the minute is essentially the same as paying by the year.  Not sure about abroad, but here in the states, salaries are typically denominated in a yearly amount and employers then split up the payments into 52, or 26, or 12 payments throughout the year.  If they give you 52 paychecks, each one would be 1/52nd of your yearly salary.  If they give you 12 paychecks, each one would be 1/12th of your yearly salary.
I like weekly and bi-weekly paychecks because they always come on a Friday.  It keeps things consistent.  With every paycheck, I can say to myself:  "I worked 2 weeks, and I got paid for 2 weeks."  If I were paid monthly, there would be paychecks where I would say:  "I worked 28 days, and I got paid for 30.41666 days" which would throw off my equilibrium.  Yeah, paying by the minute just feels more correct to me.

Bitcoin is meant for one thing--secure value transfer and all that goes with being able to accomplish that goal.  How to move money from A to B securely and without the possibility of censorship.  I believe the only real way to do that is proof of work.  The incentive system in Bitcoin is perfect for enabling this kind of security.  
This is what I don't like about the argument that "something better could come along."  It assumes that bitcoin is just *currently* the most secure blockchain, and that all the other 2500 shitcoins are trying to beat it in some way, and that if we just keep working at it, we'll make something better and bitcoin will go away.  In reality though, bitcoin has no serious contenders.  Bitcoins value is mainly it's network value.  Short of a catastrophic bug (which is possible), or an unimaginable new technology (also possible, but remember, even Bitcoin can't be considered "new technology")... It's had 10 years to kickstart an entire industry and infrastructure revolution and now that it's been so long since we've kicked that ball down the hill, it's far enough that, I'm sure, we can't kick another ball fast enough to catch up.

We fundamentally disagree.  Your node can "confirm" your transaction all it likes, but that means nothing if every other node discards it.

That's a big assumption there...
The way I understood the OPs scenario--they bought near the low, thought we were nearing the top of a bull trap and (rashly and drastically) took profit, then realized they wanted to go full long, and bought back in at a higher price.
The only taxable event in that case was selling BTC for USD.  If the OP bought in late 2017, their cost basis might be higher than 7k, so that would be a capital loss; if the OP bought at any other time, it's probably a capital gain (possibly even a short-term capital gain if they bought near the recent $3200 low)...

To be fair, CZ did pretty much immediately roll back his "suggestion" and clarify that bitcoin's security and censorship resistance is it's most valuable feature...the two things that NO OTHER CHAIN can seriously claim to have at it's core the way bitcoin has.
This whole "discussion" happened in less than 12 hours.  If he was ACTIVELY TRYING to hurt bitcoin--he played it very very poorly.

I had to stop buying in 2017 because my position got way too large way too fast... I was stubborn and refused to sell since early 2013, I would only buy.  In 2017 I started getting those panicky feeling and knew I had to reallocate some of the crypto into other assets.  I waited until I needed to make big purchases, and then put some serious thought into whether I wanted to use bitcoin or USD to pay for them.  
In the end, I sold (or gifted) what I needed to sell, not too little and not too much.  The bear market slowly eased me back into a long-term bullish mindset (and also naturally reallocated my wealth into comfortable ratios).  Now I have optimism and hope for the next cycle!
I've been through these cycles since it crashed from $12 to $5.  I (like to think I) know a lot more now than I did back then.  Selling creates taxable events and selling and re-buying within a year leads to some very weird and possibly very bad tax scenarios.  Be very careful about selling.  Better to just stick to a reasonable allocation and HODL it for 10 or 20 more years.

As much as I hate Binance right now, I think they might have helped bitcoin a lot with their suggestion to rollback the chain.  That notion was swiftly shut down by the community (users, devs, and miners) almost within a single day.
Buzzwords become more tangible when the very notion of tampering with the blockchain was shut down within hours.  It proved that "censorship-resistant" and "scarce" have real meaning now that we know a hard fork like that won't be tolerated.
Ethereum, IMO the next biggest contender in terms of adoption, recognition, and general progress in growth--did exactly such a hard fork early on and immediately ruined any idea that Ethereum is scarce or secure.  It's an arguably good platform for running smart contracts today--definitely not for storing or transferring a large amount of value...
I really think for a lot of people, CZ might have just shined a light on exactly why bitcoin more than any other altcoin has value, and isn't just stupid internet money.

That is a major feature of Bitcoin.  Trust is not.  Anytime trust enters the equation, you need to really understand what it is you're trusting.  Exchanges, other nodes, Reddit users... 
Hell, trusting the Bitcoin core reference client is a big leap of faith for most people

Your missing the point of Bitcoin though.  I'm done.

If bots are people then fine.  /s
Seriously though, I do think the vast majority of people in this space aren't ready for it.  Or rather the space isn't yet ready for people who know nothing about anything.  
It reminds me of that clip from the today show where the hosts were talking about what their email address means...in the dumbest possible way from today's standards.

"Selling \[shitty assets\] for \[the best asset\]..." is not selling for a loss

This was the comment that this thread needed.

SAFU = Secure Asset Fund for Users.  Binance, starting in Q3 2018, has (supposedly) been putting 10% of their fees into a separate cold wallet, for situations like this.  They (supposedly) have socked enough away over the past 3 quarters to cover this loss.  
The jury is still out.  They demanded a week (at least) to keep withdrawals disabled while they supposedly investigate the depth of hackers infiltration.  They may also be trying to line up funds in addition to that SAFU, before they reopen withdrawals.  It's possible the SAFU is fully funded to cover this loss--they would have needed $1.5 million in fees per day in order for their 10% number to have covered the $40ish million they lost.
We won't know until we get more info or until it all just plays out...

True.  "Owning bitcoin" is the same as "knowing the 256 bit number you need for the bitcoin network to let you spend the bitcoin".  
Running a node, though, gives you the power of sovereignty on the network, and also adds some horsepower to the network in that your node will be forwarding transactions broadcast by other nodes.  In a P2P network, every node adds an exponential level of value to the system as a whole.
But you are still 100% correct, owning bitcoin is a simple as remembering 12 words.

This is my last try at helping to lay out how this network operates...
A "fully synced node" is impossible.  Such a node would need to be in communication with every other node in the network, and I'm almost certain there's no such node.  A synced node (i.e. when you look at your bitcoin software and it has a green checkmark) just means that it's verified all of the blocks in the longest chain it's been told about by \*any\* of it's neighboring peers.  You need to absolutely trust all of your peers.  Or you need to have EVERY OTHER NODE as your peer simultaneously.   Otherwise, you're only a partial participant in the network, and you're relying on trust in counterparties (peers).  
At that point complexity takes over and running a node has a trivial (and unpredictable) effect.  A very very small number of node operators go through the effort of white-listing their peers.  
Bitcoin is called "trustless", and it's power and value comes from the fact that you are actually able to theoretically use it without trusting a single other person, including your counterparty.  BUT, just because it can be used without trust, doesn't mean it must be used that way, or will be used that way.  In fact, bitcoin is a complex economic system with new incentives that haven't been tested by humans before.  So we'll see how it plays out.  But in any case......
OP-- you can definitely own bitcoin without running a node.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:25:25
No, you really don't need a node to know that you own it.  Running a node gives you the power to "decide" who owns what, but in essence, a private key only really "holds" bitcoin if THE ENTIRE NETWORK IN AGGREGATE agrees that it does.  Your running a node or not running a node has almost no impact on whether or not your 256 bit private key has any value or not...
Case in point:  there are many more "owner" of bitcoin than there are "node operators"

There have been so few "money epochs" in human history that I can count them on one hand.  When gold first was recognized as "money" by humans, do you really think it was because of expected CASH FLOW, or some expectation that the gold, by it's essence, would be WORTH MORE in the future through capitalist endeavors?
Hell No!!  It was soft and pretty and there wasn't much of it, but people could find it all of the earth if they looked hard enough.  People saw other people accumulating it and wanted some for themselves.  People saw other people offering goods and services in exchange for it.  So it turned into money and people stopped using seashells and dyes for reasons that are obvious in retrospect--but I'm certain there were arguments just like we're having now, except about using Gold instead of Shells, going on back in those days.
Just because our current system is shaped a certain way today, doesn't imply that it's BETTER than the way it used to be (especially when it's so easy to spread lies on a global scale these days about the state of our society).  A global, transparent, hard money like bitcoin is exactly what humanity needs.

I definitely agree that bitcoin has an amazing system of incentives--probably the best, most elegant system I've ever considered.
I only take issue with your preface of "...in theory, ...".  No one knows that the value of bitcoin will continue to grow.  It might go in for another (hopefully final) bearish move in this cycle, but before it takes off again, a catastrophic bug might FORCE the community to do a dev-supported roll back--at it's lowest prices since the peak.  Bitcoin has been forced to hard-fork before.  Even if it's not contentious, it will still be very bad--and miners might not have any control over it, if the bug is serious enough.
We're still finding very bad bugs in bitcoin; the reference client is still beta 0.x software.  Most nodes today are still vulnerable to the inflation bug from last September.  It's not a simple choice for miners to try a roll back or not, but it's pretty clear that their decisions are heavily weighted in the right direction (for now).  :-)
That being said, I'm EXTREMELY pleased how this played out.  CZ mentioned it, the community POUNCED ON HIS ASS for it, and he very quickly relented and rolled it back.  The whole "discussion" took less than 12 hours across the globe.  That's incredible to me.  
I hope he actually spoke to miners about this and the miners also agreed that going down that road is stupid.   Even if they didn't, the longer bitcoin continues to operate securely, the less likely those hesitant miners  will be over time to choose to burn it down vs. keeping it going.  All my fears above might never come to pass--and I'm definitely rooting for that.

It's tough to say...  For all of human history until now, humans we're required to expend a lot of resources and energy to store wealth.  Bitcoin reduces that cost to 256 bits.  It changes the equation fundamentally...
We're 10 years in... I think in 25 years, most humans will know, implicitly, how to secure a 256 bit value, almost as easily as they know their native language.
