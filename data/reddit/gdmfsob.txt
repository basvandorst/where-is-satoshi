Lots of mixed feelings. I wanted everyone around me to share in the empowerment, but I also wanted to be right when everyone around me doubted. It must be like a religion or something by now.

OK, Nice! At least we know its possible that it can work. I am not sure what I am doing wrong.

Heh, ok ok, So I did know about clicking the lines. To be more clear, I looking for the zoomed out view, and then be able to zoom back in. Currently, under the 'all' view, I can only see up to 56.00... and would like to see beyond that. I think I did it once.

I did contact them. They are not communicating with me or trying to tell me what even happened. I was looking to see if anyone had a similar issue to mine, so I could be proactive while I am waiting for a response. chill bro

I did contact them, to which they replied 'Looks like we've corrected it already. Sorry for the trouble!' Though nothing looks to have changed. I have tried contacting them again, but to no avail....

I'm using chase. Is there anything I can do if it is on the banks end? I didn't see the transaction on my account statement. I thought it was weird that I had the bit coins in holding all weekend, and then it was reversed Monday morning. What if I had transferred them out?
@_date: 2013-02-17 05:17:58
There error  message I get is:
No Account / Unable to Locate Account (R03)
This happens sometimes with non-standard bank accounts or if there was a typo on the account number or routing number. You may want to double check the information and restart the verification process again. You can also contact Coinbase support if the problem persists. Apologies for the trouble!
I have contacted them, they replied that they have 'taken care' of it. I re verified my account, but my next purchase was reversed as well with same error message. when i search for ACH on chase.com, it only comes up with a business account option. maybe I'm missing something.

Alright, I like bitcoinity for that reason too. I was hoping that I was just missing something with gox.

The timing of the mtgox/coinlab deal along with the all time high seems odd... coincidental? There are no coincidents. Lasts nights action seemed to stem from one or two people. I feel its likely players from coinlab wanted the ALL TIME HIGH to help their announcement. I think it worked. 
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:08:58
yes, it is likely that as the price crept toward ATH, they more and more considered making the announcement. I wonder if they just decided to push it over, as it was pretty close. who knows? 
@_date: 2013-02-17 05:20:06
Maybe I'll sign up for an account there if I can't figure this out. 
@_date: 2013-02-13 23:36:04
Yea its really weird, the coins sat there all weekend and then they reversed on Monday. How could they have given me the coins if the account was wrong? I just wish I wasn't so in the dark.

Found this one:  
smaller than bitcointalk...
