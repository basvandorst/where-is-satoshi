Yes that's possible.

I just bought more. I took out 50% of my money on the 8th of January. And now I'm buying back in the dip. You are too late now. You need to act before the dips happen.

Wtf. Pooper. He did not ask if electrum is a hardware wallet. He asked if it was a offline wallet.

But you can't ignore all the news? What if the lightning network is being deployed and it's a success? That might be a good time to sell bitcoin cash. You need to check it daily when something is happening, no?

He didn't steal it. You handed a complete stranger an envelope with 14000$

It's actually sad that if you google: "What is LN?" that you don't get the correct answer :(

Fake bullshit. Why would anyone post a Pic of their girlfriend on a bitcoin subreddit

What do you mean it makes your key less secure? If I reuse the same adress multiple times it makes my private key less secure? That doesn't make any sense
  I see why it hurts privacy. But not why it hurts security. Enlighten me

So if I understand you correctly:     Exposing public key (aka address) is unsafe. And you expose your public key when you send from that address. This is why after sending your change goes to a different address automatically. At least electrum does this.
  Is this correct?
  Thx for your post!

My experience was completely different a few days ago. I was paying something online and the website showed me the bitcoin address and a one hour timer.
I increased my fee multiple times (1 to 5 to 7 sat ).
In the end when I only had 5 minutes left and still no confirmation I put the slider on maximum which was 27 sat and then it got confirmed quickly.
When I checked a site that shows the size of the mempool there was a peak right when I did my transaction.
It was not a good experience

I can email you a program TotallyLegitWalletGenerator.exe !   
It won't steal your bitcoin I promise!
Do you think that running code outside a browser is more safe than inside a browser? They are equally unsafe. 
If you have javascript code that generates a paper wallet for you. Why don't you do it while your machine is offline? 
Or verify that the code does exactly what you want and nothing more?

I don't get how bisq works even after watching videos. So you decide on buying btc and you have to send a bank transfer to the other guy. I don't understand how I am protected from being scammed. How do I know for sure the other party will send the BTC?

Funniest thing I've seen all day! Could use a "this is actually good for bitcoin"

You claim that you can easily pay off 200 every month but you don't have 10k saved up? I don't think you can easily pay off 200...
