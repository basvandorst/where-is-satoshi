Ethereum is doing something about it (they can because they have the time bomb) whereas Bitcoin is now unable to do a hard fork due to the risk of creating yet another currency.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:53:10
Or using other means. Like by not using bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:07:21
Change to any other coin
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:20:56
There's too much of a risk of people remaining on the original chain and claiming to be the "real bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:07:51
I think the core wallet doesn't implement it yet that's why there are several exchanges that haven't implemented it yet either.
Please explain why you think that tx would be lower.

More than 100% for the coffee
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:23:04
Just the truth. I hope it will change in the future. And I don't own bcash. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:28:20
Even with 100% segwit adoption there are too many transactions for bitcoin to handle, resulting in sustained high transaction fees.
Segwit is just a drop in the bucket!
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:41:00
But Bitcoin is unable to do a hard fork.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:10:32
Only if they introduce an electric lambo.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:01:12
Yes, that's what I'm saying: The demand is greater than the capacity, even with 100% segwit adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:28:22
Looks like you need 140 for it to go through now
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:08:54
It's the same with Ethereum, i paid 0.1 GWei today for calling a contract using 125,000 gas (a normal transaction is 21,000 gas) resulting in a $0.01 fee and it went through. Yet almost 20% of the users still pay 50 GWei or more.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:00:16
The reason "we hold fairly steady" is that the fees keep rising. With very high fees people stop doing transactions. As soon as fees come down, the number of transactions will rise to the maximum, even if the new maximum is around 200% of the old one.
Segwit doesn't provide enough scaling to make a substantial difference at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:23:38
The cost is that bitcoin lost a huge amount of market share.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:19:24
That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying a 100% increase of capacity wouldn't be enough to get rid of the big fees and slow transactions, for bitcoin as it is today. It would be somewhat helpful, but not a big of a deal as people are saying.
On the other hand i'm pretty sure a 10x increase in transactions per second would be pretty great for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:58:28
The fees would be lower. But they would still be too high.
So doing something else that provides a greater relief may be the better option.
Why do you think the tx time would be lower?
As soon as the fees decrease the volume will increase.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:03:05
The percentage of the amount you are actually paying for is more interesting.
I.e. if you pay something that costs $30 and you pay $30 in fees, that's 100% extra fees.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:31:53
Well, the 1MB limit was sufficient for the first couple of years.
A higher limit will be sufficient for a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:08:18
No, bitcoin is in a corner now, unable to do future hard forks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:53:50
Volatility is getting more of a problem when transactions are slow (or when there are returns)
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:10:18
It went from a Model X to a Model 3, right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:48:48
What if it can't be fixed without a hardfork? I don't think bitcoin is capable of a smooth hardfork at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:12:20
Read up on Merkle trees
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:42
It's only a matter of time until the transaction fees reach a level where even its use as a "store of value" is affected.
The slow transaction are already a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:24:29
More like 35% from $19777 to $12873 within 5 days. But it's already back on its way up. So I agree on the good recovery.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:54:27
Sounds like you are also a source then.

I would say it's the sound of millions of people rushing into the space due to FOMO
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:22
When was the last time you bought something with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:13:24
When $4 fees warrant a post on why it's so cheap...
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:41:40
No, that's just Americans.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:26:10
More people are willing/forced to pay higher fees to get their transactions into the blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:38:26
Are you going to pay with bitcoin? And pay $4 in fees for a $5 bundle?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:35:01
Umm.. low fees and faster transactions. Those are the two problems that Valve mentioned.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:21:07
I thought it's no longer money, merely a "store of value"...
@_date: 2017-01-24 10:43:48
That's a lot less utility than before. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:52:29
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:41:33
Don't store it in an online wallet. Transfer it to a paper wallet.

He must be American.

The Raspberry Pi 2+3 have only 1GB RAM ...
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:46:40
This is just a short spike. Why does it matter?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:47:25
But it will go down again shortly - surely you realize that?
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:43:46
Why do you think BTC fees will get better? [It doesn't look like it]( Right now the average transaction fee is at $57.
Of course, sending "thousands of dollars across the world" is not something people do a lot. In fact, it's something you do rarely. Most of the time when money is transfered the amounts are less than $11,400 and it's done locally.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:24:23
Next time do it at GDAX with your Coinbase account - less fees!
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:27:49
is a Radpberry Pi 1 with 256MB RAM sufficient?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:18:08
Have you calculated the issuance rate since the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:36:28
Because of its stupid headline you mean?
