OK, but some rich hedge funds are making a shitload of money off people who 'believe in bitcoin'
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:09:38
oh yeah when bitcoin is over 10k then this sub is all lambos and moons and shit.  i bet you personally were smug as hell early this year thinking you've hit on a sure-fire way to get rich easy.  And you don't even have to do anything or even leave your computer
but then the piper comes calling and you lose 10% of your value for 3 consecutive days.   the skeptics are vindicated but you don't want to hear any of it now.  
guess what: your predictive skills are terrible.    no matter what you think BTCs floor is now you're wrong.   the floor is zero.
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:35:21


Hmm from what I understand about investing is that usually you want to make investments that go up in value, not down in value
But maybe I just don't "get it" and losing 20% of your net worth is really the plan all along
Oh wait sorry by your insane definition of "loss" you've actually lost 40% of your net worth, the entire value of your investment

@_date: 2018-11-30 20:23:11
and as the value of those bitcoins decreases the value of your portfolio has tanked.  you would have a higher net worth if you had never bought a single bitcoin.
it's pretty ironic that you would ever accuse someone else of 'not getting it' when by your own admission you are bad at timing the market and you have only lost large amounts of money with your investments.  
what should I be getting?  that it's fun to get swindled out of your money?    investment is a zero sum game.  for every rich wall street banker there's dozens of people that lost money to make them rich.  You are in the second category.   other, smarter investors have _taken your money_ and for some insane reason you're both happy about this and lining up to give them more.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:47:11
Losing massive amounts of money doesn't sound fun to me but to each his own I guess.  That's pretty much in line with you continually contracting yourself and posting nonsensical things repeatedly.

you have no idea about any of this stuff.  all you know is that you love bitcoin and anyone who disagrees with you is a troll.
you already said you are bad at timing the market.  why are you trying to time bear and bull markets on BTC/crypto?   
you think you have some deep insight into how you can get rich fast with crypto.   bad news for you buddy, that ship already sailed.  A bunch of people got rich off of crypto by selling overpriced coins _to you_.   You will never get rich off this, you will only make other people rich.

$100m is a rounding error for JPMC.  They could find that much money in their couch cushions.   
If they want to sink $100m into bitcoin just in case it shoots up to 50k or something that is zero risk for them.    It's still not a savvy investment for anyone to make and he wasn't "playing you".   
It looks like him blasting bitcoin is vindicated.  It's been a terrible investment for anyone buying in after last november.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:19:02


What do you think those odds are, roughly, and what are you basing this on?    That's an extremely bold prediction.
In my view bitcoin will sink below 1k and once it does it will probably not ever go above 2k again after that point.   20k+ is exceedingly unlikely.
But that's fine, that would actually be healthy for bitcoin if it could find a stable price point and lock in there for years.   It is better overall even if it doesn't have the side effect of making you rich.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:52:27

Even if they accrue interest on their account that doesn't affect the value of the currency itself.  In fact the currency itself is decreasing in value as they accumulate that interest.
You don't make any points to refute, you are mixing up different concepts.   An individuals bank account is not related to the value of the currency relative to other currencies.

That's actually a much worse situation for a currency to be in than the continual devaluation we've been seeing.  Nobody is going to want to adopt a currency that continues to rise in value. 
You want to have your cake and eat it too.  You want your investment to continue to increase in value (obviously) and at the same time you want the kind of stability required of a mainstream currency.     You can't have both, and realistically you wont get either one.
You are being fleeced out of your money with the promise of riches...

Not impossible, anyone buying bitcoins right now is betting that it will happen again
But it takes 10x as much capital infusion to go from 1000-&gt;10,000 as it does to go from 100-&gt;1000, the percentages alone don't tell the whole story.   In order for bitcoin to go that high (&gt;10k) again you need to find someone willing to buy at those prices, which IMO is going to be difficult.   Who is going to want to spend 10k or 20k on 1 bitcoin when in all likelihood it will have another 80% crash?
You said it yourself, these massive crashes are commonplace.

the thing is, if the price goes up there's no obligation to buy it at all
you are operating under the flawed assumption that buying bitcoins is a necessity for anyone.    if in the (extremely remote) chance that bitcoin does go up again, none of those "panic sellers" have an impetus to buy back in at a higher price.
and since you seem to think bitcoin will 'moon' again, how does that make them fools for "buying back in much higher later" when bitcoin will only continue to rise in price?   they may make less money than someone who buys in at the lowest point, but they would still have net profit.   of course that is moot anyway, because it wont happen.
you are literally losing money every second.  every time you buy more bitcoins you set yourself up for even further losses.   under no circumstances should anyone take cues from you or attempt to emulate your behavior.    you literally lost money from the time I started writing this comment until now.
and you seem strangely eager to give away more of your money.     a person who has lost such vast amounts of money on bad bitcoin trades is in no position to call anyone else foolish.  by default anyone who never bought bitcoin in the first place is more financially savvy and wiser than you.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:33:08
Gold, silver and all metals have real world uses unlike bitcoin.   There's gold and silver inside every electronic device you own.  Gold is well-suited for molding and shaping yet not so ductile that it loses its shape easily, which has made it well suited to ornamentation and jewelry.   It can be easily purified and the processes to do so have been known for thousands of years.   It's relatively rare compared to other metals which is why it has such a high price.   
But it's not just gold.. copper, zinc, tin, titanium, uranium, platinum etc all have some value attached to them since you can construct things out of them.   It may be less than the value of gold but that's mostly because they are more plentiful on earth than gold.   You can't build anything out of bitcoin or use it for anything.    If it's not going to be competitive as an online payment facilitator it is completely useless.
Since there are trace elements in computers and ASIC chips, amusingly gold is required in order to mine bitcoin but bitcoin has no use for mining gold.

That's an extreme gamble


The reason you can't see anything clearly is because your eyes are full of dollar signs.   You are losing so much money every minute every hour every day but for some reason you think this is a route to make yourself rich
You have tunnel vision sir.  You may make some people rich but it wont be yourself.  It's the people who have convinced you to buy their bitcoins at 6k 5k 4k 3k.  They are straight up taking your money and you will not get it back.
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:54:57


No, I think it can be a real currency used for a wide variety of transactions but I think it also needs to be stable at a (relatively) low dollar figure for that to happen.  Something like 300$ bitcoins with only a +/- 50$ deviation for a year would be great for bitcoins adoption and confidence.  As it is it cant be used for anything other than speculation at the moment.
Also honestly I think there are better coins out there, bitcoin is just the first one but it's so technologically limited it should be supplanted by something thats more scalable in the long term.

the public face of bitcoin are lunatics and scammers.   it's inferior to fiat in all real-world use cases.    if you buy-in you're basically praying that some shady investment fund pump-n-dumps it so you can ride the wave up and cash out.

Stocks rarely lose 80% of their value in a calendar year, if they do it's generally a catastrophic event that bankrupts a lot of people and usually takes the company with it.   There's also benefits to owning them like dividends and shareholder voting, stuff you don't get with bitcoin.    Corporate stock valuations are based on revenue projections and are backed up by economic activity.   Bitcoins value is based entirely on speculation at the moment.
If bitcoin was a regular stock it would be a prime target for bain capital and the like to come in and liquidate the company.  It only survives at all now because it's so different from a stock.   I don't think you can draw a neat comparison between the two.
If you really want to buy low on a speculative currency you can get a zillion venezuelan bolivars for only a few dollars USD right now.   How much lower can it possibly go?   Seriously, they have so much oil that their economy could immediately rebound with some competent leadership.
I don't think bitcoin will reach its ATH of 20k ever again, just because it's too risky to buy bitcoins at that price.   Even retail investors will be scared away from high priced bitcoins due to its proclivity for crashing.   You would have to be absolutely convinced that "this time it will be different" and I don't think anyone has that kind of confidence in bitcoin, at least not anyone with enough money to move the needle.

@_date: 2018-12-13 22:22:46
Right but if the price is really high like at 20k, thats a huge amount of potential loss you're looking at.  You're almost guaranteed to lose 80%+ of your investment with a drop down to 4000$.  But if bitcoin is at 300$ it's far less likely to go down 80% to 60$ since it's historically pretty stable around that mark.


But why?  Every time bitcoin goes up it crashes by like 80%.  If you're buying in when bitcoin is at high prices you're almost certainly going to lose money.    Last year we were in uncharted territory so you could get some people on board due to FOMO or all those "thanksgiving dinner" discussions or "bitcoins for christmas".  You had people hyping it all over the place and "normies" were getting into it.   Most people didn't expect the price to tank so fast.  I think it's going to be extremely difficult to convince people to buy-in again, or attract new buyers.
To move the price up that much you need a lot of people willing to buy at high prices, and thus those people need to be convinced that bitcoin will remain at a high price and go up from there.   When bitcoin is rubberbanding all the time you can't have any confidence in its stability and it will scare off buyers.  All thats left is currency manipulators and you're really rolling the dice with them.
