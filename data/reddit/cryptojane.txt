Can i just state the obvious please...
This isn't going to do diddly squat. It's like trying to get your grandmother to use VPN, Bittorent, and TOR simultaneously to pirate PPV wrestling events and render them to a 4K stream to broadcast on a private network that she will need to configure herself.
Sorry... but you guys aren't holding cryptoCURRENCY anymore. It's just numbers in a computer now, and pretty soon everybody else is going to figure that out.

It's 100% accurate and to the point. You're not holding a usable currency anymore regardless of how durable the internals may be against some arbitrary set of protocol machinations. "Oh my dollars are doing great just look at how they don't fall apart in the wash".

Hey let's not forget the Core devs are early adopters. Those guys are rolling in USD naked right now. There's no hurry to fix this shit show.

Sorry guys can't resist. Long time BTC user here. Darknet since SR1. Not a bcash troll. I just gotta say...

LOL. We're the 99% dude. We're not sitting on huge piles of crypto like Andreas and the 1%. One great way to bring fees down is to bring the price down. 400 satoshis at $100/BTC sounds fine to me. We do not give one shit about the hodlers.
