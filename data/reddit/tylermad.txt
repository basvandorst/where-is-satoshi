If I delete it , can they still steal my xpub?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:55:04
But how to happen.virus? If my computer have no virus,it can still steal my xpub when I’m running old version?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:23:53
if i use trezor to connect electrum, had I been hacked?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:21
Can claim the United bitcoin, you can see ub.com. But i don’t know if it’s a scam
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:27:43
i love this man
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:37
From one address to the same address. To itself. Is that safe?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:40:38
 Is that a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:05
raw transaction？what is it？
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:23
Thank you very much
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:09
Thank you . The fee is not a problem. I just want to know is there some issues about safety to send bitcoin from address to itself 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:47:15
But how to scam me
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:36:12
I use TREZOR. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:57
I only worried about the transaction to address itself. I heard some information that if bitcoin system being attack ,it can have some issues, but I don’t remember what issues is. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:21:33
offline virtualbox. no key logger.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:29:37
thanks buddy
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:02:10
thank you very very very much！i do this because i worry about the paper that include seed. It’s too hard to store it. So I remember the 12 words. I think I should creat a new 24 words and remember. 
Is it 4 pin safety? They have 3/10000 chances to transfer all my bitcoin?that’s bad. 
And how I know my ledger is not be modified?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:16:48
what is GDAX？ is it coinbase？
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:58:00
thanks .i will study it
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:12:42
yeah thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:21:45
no physical contact， how to jailbreak
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:36:25
I have some in SegWit. But the other I want to save .
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:58:57
bither is a wallet that bitcoin.org recommended.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:41:44
Is The purpose of a hardware wallet to prevent the physical hack, like your said iOS is safe with no physical contact,that means my seed is safe. So why I have to creat a new seed ? I already post in ledgerwallet but no satisfy reply.  So thank you very much for reply me. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:21:11
you are the best bro!this community is awesome,you are awesome!
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:37:19
host machine is mac, virtual machine is win7.that’s safe,right?
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:55:47
I hope you buy two planes with bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:47:18
I know your point. but my house can fire.the bank also can be destroyed when there is a war. how can I  store the paper safety? if I lost the 24 words the passphrase is nothing.... ahhhhh I'm paradox again.. can I put it into a cloud box? but when come with the internet it's not safe,isnt it?
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:46:16
thank you . but the official website: WARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:25:05
i keep the iOS 12 words in mind,so I don’t want to remember 24 new ledger words.. that’s my think. I want to put 12 words into ledger recover my old iOS wallet,is it safe?
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:13:05
are they both BIP 39 ? now I'm doing a disaster recovery.my phone with bither is broken. and I remember the seed for a year. that's a problem.... if there not some serious problem I really want my old seed. thank you very very much . 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:17:53
because if I generate new seed and I forgot it.all my money is gone.that's my concern.. store 24 words is really hard...
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:14:03
Ok. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:31:36
thanks for the detailed reply.
if that's no physical touch and the app download from the App Store,is there any hacker can hack the wallet through the wifi? I use the bitcoin.org recommended wallet.I only worry about my home wifi.I google a lot, but I can't find any information that can hack a app in iOS only through wifi.i only connect to wifi one minute to download the app, and cut the internet when I use the wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:04:24
thank for your reply.but why ? bither's seed is not safe? I want the old seed because I already keep it in my mind. so I don't want change. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:42:20
thanks for every reply.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:34:03
that memes calm the FUD down i think
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:15:54
the password i remember 
so i can zip seeds and put it to dropbox
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:13:50
Congratulations！Your friends will leave you a year later because at that time you will be a rich bastard.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:45:11
Thanks for your advise. I bought a ledger nano s  already. But I want import the iOS wallet’s seed into the ledger,so I want to ensure the iOS’s seed is safe. I already remember the seed. If iOS’s seed is safe,I don’t want to change it. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:29:59
that's the paradox I think many times. I use bitcoin because I want freedom. away from the banks.but when I had bitcoin.there is seed.i want store seed safety ,I must store the seed on paper and put the paper into the bank safe box. is it a centralize ? because the bank has  my seed that has my bitcoin...... I think this question many times....
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:59:10
thank you. So I have no reason to move my saving to SegWit if I just want to save it,right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:29:07
use gold color .the green reminds me the Bcash. Fuck the bcash. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:06:02
don’t think so what,can’t hack it or it’s not secure? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:12:35
thank you for the reply. that means no physical contact. It’s very secure?
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:24:12
any advices? I have many bitcoins but I think store the seed safe is really a problem.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:21:28
12 words is hard. 24 words is tooooooo hard..
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:31:57
normal people and institution who has more money
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:31:12

@_date: 2018-07-22 03:20:53
