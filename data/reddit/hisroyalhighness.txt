Visa has the power to do this because not accepting Visa would be a hassle to customers and lose them business. It actually goes beyond displaying the names, credit card companies take a percentage of the transaction from the vendor. Also Visa is a company  that makes it easier to use a currently existing currency and not a new currency in itself.
Bitcoin does not have this sway, nor is there a company behind it pushing these requirements  like there is credit cards.

No, but they would be the ones laid off. Then without work and with already meager or no savings in a constantly worsening economy they would wind up homeless/destitute. 
The rich already have enough money to live on they are always fine, such is the power of money.

Its not that cutting back would be bad, its the massive drop in sales that would be bad. The economy has grown to operate at a certain level, a drop below that level would cause increased lay-offs then an even further reduction in spending due to people no longer having jobs to provide an disposable income.

I'm saying that the economy has adapted to us, unfortunately this "us" is a group of 300+ million, or more if you want to include the global economy, and "we" keep buying pointless items and new versions in shiny new boxes.

It relies on pointless consumption because people kept consuming pointlessly. However, to stop it now would crush the lower/working class. It is a device of our own (the consumer's) design and at this point we kinda have to go with it, or we could have a massive revolution but that sounds messy.
