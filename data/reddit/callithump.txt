Don't worry about it , it's not heroin, it's currency.
It's like numismatics, but not as interesting to look at or read about as physical coins. 
Find something else to do or talk about. Bitcoin is about as boring to talk about as numismatics to most people. 
Just like you don't care that I found a 1995 double die  penny in my change from purchasing an icee at  a gas station in Oxford Mississippi in 2010.
You should find something else to do and think about, otherwise you'll become very boring, take up gardening or something.

Bitcoins true value is in the block chain, but right now it's monetary value is derived almost entirely from speculation.
I'll continue to slowly liquidate.

You could send it to one of the gambling sites wait for it to confirm and withdraw it to another address, it'll cost you 2 transaction fees though
Don't really understand why you'd want to though...
It'll probably come from a different address than where you sent it to which is probably good enough for 5 pounds.

I don't really understand the benefit of hardware wallets.
My hardware "wallet" is a list of private keys hand written in pencil in a rite in the rain notebook should last a few hundred years more than i'll be alive.
I do have an offline raspberry pi that I use to sign transactions and generate new key pairs, but I don't leave private keys on there.
