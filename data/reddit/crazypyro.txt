I'm not arguing one way or the other because I have no skin in the game, but I think its a bit disingenuous to say that there is no chance of this all being real.

How bout the statement by the other exchanges? The amount of denial is hilarious. We don't know one way or another, so this post is just as bad as the posts saying its all real. Need a mod delete.

Translates to "our offline wallets were not really offline" I think.

Game over.

Wow! Did they edit the word Insolvency out of the post?

mtgox.com officially dead. This thread is just untrue spam now.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:23:38
Its more "proof" than the shit people are calling proof that its not real. Also as soon as this document leaked, MtGox shut down trading.

Madoff is suspected of stealing over $50B. You got a long way to go.

Could this not be a draft? Maybe a disgruntled employee leak?

Does the U.S. gov't recognize BCash as an asset?
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:15:56
Who decides Bcash has support/value? Whats the bar? Where are the qualifying requirements explicitly laid out?
The liquidity of Bcash is almost as bad as a fork with no support at the moment.

Your argument basically boils down to "nothing is illegal if you don't get caught" which seems kind of obvious. Either way, I don't really think making this guy out to be a hero is right. 
At best, its an ethical/moral grey zone.

He could give the owners the option to reclaim them without charging a finder's fee and simply keep any BCH that isn't claimed. 
If we are going by the laws of many nations, yes, he could legally keep the coins forever (or until the rightful owner came to him and asked for them), but by specifically trying to extract a finder's fee, he is in fact breaking the laws of many of those same nations. 
I'm not trying to have an ethical argument, just simply stating that these laws exist. I also understand the blockchain isn't exactly a place with black and white legal zones.
edit: response to your 2nd sentence: You can't provide a "service" for returning lost goods when the owners know you possess their lost goods. You could actually get charged with theft in that case. Some nations provide a formula for "finder's fee" (believe Germany is 5% up to 500 euro which is significantly less than this guy is trying to charge...)
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:04:46
This argument would never hold up in an actual courthouse, but I guess the mental gymnastics help you to not feel too bad about yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:43:16
Most countries have laws defining the boundaries of "finder's fees" because it opens up the victim to being manipulated and scammed. Also it can promote manipulating people into "losing" stuff as a con artist could setup a trap and then charge people to recover their things.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:57:20
And by trying to extract a finder's fee after telling the rightful owners that you currently possess their lost goods, you are committing theft in most nations.

I like the it means "Hold On for Dear Life" revisionist history better.
