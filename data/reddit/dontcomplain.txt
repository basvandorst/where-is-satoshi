if bitcoin is just worthless code, then gold is worthless rock.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:32:42
I second this
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:21:47
Hold the sarcasm. But it will go back to dominance because Coinbase is being invested for fraud and bcash holders will dump it unless they want to be arrested for committing fraud as well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:49:31
Still you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:45:45
Where will you put the tattoo? I suggest the forehead so then you become famous as the bitcoin man.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:04:41
Yeah, in other cases it wouldn't matter as much, but this is a blatant example of underhanded market manipulation tactics. 
I would have supported both coins, the only reason I don't is I don't like Roger Ver, especially after the whole Andreas incident.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:43:07
It's kinda asking where the internet is stored.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:27:20
That means you too, fool. Unless you're somehow not classified as part of people.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:11:50
You're suppose to go abroad for undergrad, not grad school, to get a cheaper tuition.

When will they finish the lightning network. That would effectively kill out Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:00:38
how do you know the money is real? you can buy prop money and do the same shit with it and hand it to people for free.
the same goal is achieve and the butt hurt government can't arrest you.

Why did you choose the left ball instead of the right one?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:28:24
That's cause you only did reverse-psychology. Everyone could see that too especially since the last crash. The trick is do reverse-reverse-psychology. Adding another reverse for each milestone. :D
But really, I learn my lesson from the last milestone, little nuggets is not enough to tempt me away from the pot of gold.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:16:22
It feels like bitcoin and the rest of the coins is about to go mainstream then.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:27:17
I think people pushed it to 10k just so they could force calaber24p to eat his nut.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:27:29
But I was hoping for a bigger drop, so I can buy some ;D
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:27:38
Very poetic. So which one are you? Haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:54
that's bullshit. he retcon his original bet. so if it accelerates again next year, he can just say "i bet it won't rise over 1.5 million".
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:14:41
he buys high, sells low. :D
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:20:18
A lot of people care about Goku and he doesn't exist :D

Do even you know what a parabola is? The price you sold at before the dip also occurs when the prices rises back up. Hence the parabola. 
What benefit do you get from selling before the dip? You don't know when the dip will occur, so you might not even be near when the dip occurs. All you're doing is guessing it will be near the dip. But I know when the dip has occurred when it already has fell down.
When I say math. I meant basic logic.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:20:39
It's actually more stupid to dump before a dip. Before and after doesn't make a difference. It's a parabola. Ta-da math.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:12:58
okay thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:22:24
Wasted opportunity for a pump and dump scheme. Haha
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:44:29
Plot twist, they didn't sleep at all the day before.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:48:38
You actually just sound like you have a gambling addiction. A win is a win. Don't worry about the what-ifs.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:55:43
I can and I saw.
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:13:39
That's the complete opposite of quantitatively. The possibilities of predicting when you should pull out before the crash can essentially defined as infinite. You are saying you want to be at infinite. Thus impossible.
For example, that's why something like PI is just used as 3.14 in most calculation even though it's true value cannot be represented. Which hints at why your a gambler and not an investor because you seem always regret and never satisfied with your decisions.

I got in at $2.1K and cash out most of it before the crash yesterday. Haha. So I got a net profit of 50%. Sent 25% (initial capital + interest) to my bank and used the other 25% to buy smaller coins.
I just do general calculation along with the upcoming events. Since realistically, with the current market price, the gains doesn't justify the risk. I would only hold if I had already dumped tens of thousands into btc. Otherwise I would jump ship to the newer and cheaper coins.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:55:38
I just got mostly golem and a little Siacoin and DigiByte. I just chose coins that were in like the top 25, under a $1, had good tech and good dev.
But I don't like Ripple because it's centralized. And I didn't go after small small coins because that felt like doing penny stocks within a penny stocks.
Also, I'm still relatively new to cryptotrading. So don't blindly copy me.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:49:31
Poloniex is the popular choice and it has most of the small altcoins too. So if you're into daytrading penny stocks then poloniex is the place for you.

I guess I'm your parallel universe you then. I tried buy in at the 2100 with Coinbase too. But since they cockblock me with the authentication. I just went to local bitcoin shops and bought them in person. Then I sold before the last crash to get a 50% in profit and invested in smaller coins as well.
