Faster payments are available, we try to get all UK payments credited same day, but some times due to various bank restrictions it can take up to 3 days.

We've had our own wallet service for about a month now with [iOS]( and [Android]( apps, and we also offer deposits so you can [buy bitcoin by credit or debit card]( - £1000 per deposit for UK customers, £3000 per month maximum and £100 for non-UK issued cards per month (until further notice due to chargeback fraud). 
Edit: Ninja edit for iOS and Android app links

As a peer matched exchange that's not how we (or Bitstamp) actually operate. That $15 markup is set by our user base and not us and our fees are made for executing the trade of fiat to crypto which compared to the costs incurred for operating where we do, are very slim. 
At present, we have about 30 BTC on SELL for less than Bitstamps price, again set by a user. So rather than be negative about a lack of buy depth (which is indeed £15 out) you have a great opportunity to buy with us. 
We can't comment for any of the other exchanges but we started by serving the UK market who can be charged $35 for transferring cash to a US exchange or brokerage. So whilst a $15 difference in price might be too much for you, compared to giving the banks more money in the process, people this side of the pond would prefer to use a UK based service and exchange at a potential premium.

This is a shame for the UK and we are sad to see them go; Simon is a great guy and we wish them all the best for the future. 
Obviously we can comment first hand on how tough a market the UK is, banking is a nightmare and the hoops we have to jump through from a regulatory perspective make it especially tough to operate without very, very slim overheads.
