Friends shouldn't let friends of friends use blockchain.info wallet. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 04:23:47
Because they have proven to be extremely unreliable and insecure. People have lost loads of money using their wallet service.

If you could reverse engineer the private key, Bitcoin would not exist today. You have nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:43:35
Did you download any torrents recently?
@_date: 2015-12-21 04:28:31
You do realize that's worth about 10 cents, don't you?  I found a quarter on the ground the other day and I didn't get nearly as excited.

I recommend at least two USB drives stored in two different locations. Make sure you password protect the wallet with BIP38.

They do contribute, by helping secure the network. They get rewarded for participating.

Ha!  Good one.  Handsome in a John C Reilly kind of way.

Mike is a follower, not a leader.  If he were a leader, he would have had success.

Somehow I got 1 GB for free.   
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:01:49
I think you should have named it whichwallet.org, which would be grammatically correct. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:21:03
Fees. 
You should sell your Bitcoin (if you have any). And don't let the door hit you on the way out. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:21:42
You really shouldn't use blockchain.info.
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:28:19
You can also do this at  and it lets you protect it with an additional password.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:52:32
Define "market manipulation". Seriously. I really want to know what's going through your little brain. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:53:16
HD?  Pshhhh...  Wake me up when 4K wallets are out. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:25:06
1. Don't leave your bitcoin at Coinbase.  If Coinbase gets hacked/robbed, your money is gone.  After you buy, transfer it out to a wallet where you (and only you) have control of the private keys.  
2. Don't send your bitcoin to any gambling sites or any other sketchy addresses or they could lock down your account.
3. After you secure your bitcoin in a different wallet, be sure to back up.
4. Be very cautious about computer security.  If your computer is compromised, you are at risk of losing your bitcoin.

When will these clowns learn how to make a website that works on smartphones?  Same shit every year. And why is this amateur crap stickied on edit: just visited the website from my laptop and the formatting still looks messed up.  lol
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:28:45
Seriously... happened to me last year.  Shady Chinese motherfuckers know that there's nothing I can do about it. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 04:42:28
Yes, it will work, but I've seen cases where it displays an old receive address that you've already used.  It will still be spendable, so nothing to worry about.

Electricity, gas, and oil companies have been converting energy into money for decades. Lay off the pipe.

"what this subreddit considers to be an altcoin"
You're not serious, are you?
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:08:49
@_date: 2015-11-15 21:53:36
Cool but what does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-30 02:00:04
Just use your backup. Duh. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:14:18
I'm talking about the home page. The fucking HOME PAGE OF YOUR WEBSITE DOESN'T WORK. You're OK with that?  Wow, some people have different standards. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:01:46
Did you not bother to test your website on a phone?  Not even once?  It's completely unusable. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 02:08:32
I'd say it's feasible. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:16:44
Roger Ver is the owner. He's a tool. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:40:20
Have you seen onename?
@_date: 2015-11-18 12:57:29
Good read. You should also use more than just one round of SHA256. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:17:19
It would be a terribly overpriced, slow piece of shit. Why not buy a real computer instead?
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:38:28
I have yet to hear from a single person who can explain how mining a few satoshis would be of any use to anyone.  Dumbest idea ever.
@_date: 2015-11-17 16:53:56
Somebody please explain to me how the few satoshis that it mines is of any use.  How can you spend it when you need 1,000x more in fees.
@_date: 2015-11-27 05:42:25
You either have a shit ton of Bitcoin, or you have a really low paying job. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 19:13:23
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 15:18:44
Here's a nice list of paper wallets with ratings. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 13:13:50
Your website has formatting issues on mobile devices. It was the same story last year.  It makes you look very unprofessional. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 22:15:39


I'm surprised this hasn't happened yet.
@_date: 2016-10-02 01:33:51
He's asking why the ATM spit out cash even though there was no confirmation yet. 
The answer is that the ATM company is taking a risk in order to provide a good user experience. Perhaps it checks to make sure you included an adequate fee. Either way, it's a gamble for the ATM to spit out the cash. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 02:05:35
So, I'm guessing you don't own a smartphone?  Pretty rare these days. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 06:27:15
It seems like that would be less secure, therefore I wouldn't support it. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 04:33:09
Just because they're pro-ether doesn't mean they're anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-15 02:07:31
You have to distribute the bitcoin somehow, don't you?  Mining is a brilliant way to do that fairly. Bitcoin is still young and inflation won't be a concern for much longer. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 04:27:39
I think that's Mars.
@_date: 2015-11-14 18:14:05
A blockchain is an incredibly inefficient and slow way to run a database. You might as well run a traditional database if you're going to keep it private. 
I think that these people are either delusional or just don't understand the concept. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:53:23
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:54:55
You're deranged. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 05:35:05
So, what happens when I decide to use a different wallet?  
@_date: 2015-11-17 14:19:24
OK, so you've mined a few satoshis.  Now what?  You can't even spend it without a much larger fee..  And what good does it do for you to have a fraction of a penny?
I'm not giving you a hard time.  I genuinely want to understand why everyone is so enthusiastic about this product.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:59:27
What the FUCK does Bitcoin have to do with religion?
Go to hell you insensitive son of a bitch. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:28:30
Think about how impractical that is. For the cost of a coffee I can buy more Bitcoin than the chip could mine in a year. And by then the difficulty could be significantly higher...
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:05:49
it would take longer?  That makes no sense.
@_date: 2016-07-31 03:35:03
I sent a fairly large transaction a few hours ago. It took about 20 minutes for it to get broadcasted.

Are we supposed to think that he looks cool in that photo?  Because at first glance I thought it was an egg wearing sunglasses.
