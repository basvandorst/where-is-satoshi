You may be thinking of Segwit2x, which was a proposed fork that many people didn't like, mostly because of how it was being pushed.

r/btc was created long before BCH was imagined, when scaling solutions were first being discussed in earnest. The folks that didn't want to wait for lightning to scale were treated like trolls in r/bitcoin, so they migrated to r/btc.

I bought one of the Dell 4k monitors earlier this year. It was my first Dell purchase and will be my last. The monitor failed after a few months and when I called support they wanted a service tag number to (which doesn't exist for 24" monitors) and an order ID (which I didn't have as I ordered through a retailer). They did not seem willing to fulfill their warranty obligation without it. After numerous calls I finally had success with the business support line. 
I bought the Dell because it has an IPS panel and I do a lot of photography work. They sent me a replacement with the worst backlight bleed I've ever seen, so bad that it bleeds yellow even with a white background. There is no way it could have passed uniformity QA tests. 
The fact that they accept bitcoin is not enough for me to give them any more business.

Turing complete scripting on the blockchain sounds like a very bad idea to me, and is one of the primary reasons I'm skeptical of ethereum. I suppose it could be a boon to black hats though.

I really don't see a need. Right now the average fee is what, $0.05? If the relative value of the average fees stays constant, then after the block reward disappears we will only need 50MB blocks to provide enough fees to maintain the current value of the block reward. I'm sure in 100 years there will be more than enough bandwidth to support that without pushing out the little guys.

Does Coinsetter offer options trading?

I'm a bit sleep deprived and I thought OP was making a joke about about the physical usb "keys" and this makes me wonder if you thought the same thing. On the off chance this is true I thought I should mention it's not a joke, he's talking about your actual keys.  
If anyone can connect your reddit username to your identity then they can now unlock your front door and post office box (or whatever locks those keys actually go to).  
I suppose in any case your response is still relevant since your btc would be safe in the event of a USB drive theft.

You can actually, although your packets may or may not be forwarded and you won't get the response packets unless you have a presence on a device in the path between the two endpoints (in which case your spoofed packets would almost definitely get forwarded).
So yeah, it's not trivially easy to effectively spoof an IP address, however OP was misusing the word spoof and his meaning was clear enough so it's sort of irrelevant.

Have you ever seen the movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg?

You've got a typo (flexbility) under "Our Mission."

I know this is a joke, but I feel compelled to say this for anyone who doesn't know: do NOT use floating point numbers for bitcoin balances.

Looks cool, though my name is reserved. I politely requested that it be released. Looking forward to hearing back.

You are confused. The only mobile platform that uses C# to any serious degree is Windows. iOS is mostly Objective-C. Android is mostly Java.
"Professional application" is the last thing that comes to mind when I consider C It conjures the same images as Java. Over-engineered, underperforming, convoluted enterprise bullshit applications with terrible ux.

If you had used a password longer than 8 characters the extra characters would be ignored, until you went to activate the token. At that point it would assume whatever characters beyond the first 8 were part of the token value and would silently fail to identify the token and associate it with your account.

Write a program that multiplies the output of some random number generator by 2 and you will have an rng that only produces even numbers. Now go take a crypto course and have your mind blown by all the crazy numbers out there and how specific types of numbers are particularly useful for crypto.

There is often a difference, but it gets balanced out by arbitrage. Some people buy and sell on both US and foreign markets, and if there is a big difference they can make a profit off it (buy from the cheaper market, sell on the higher) this has the effect of causing the difference in price to shrink.
Sometimes if there is a large discrepancy it's due to an issue on the exchange e.g. slow withdrawals of either bitcoin or fiat. This could be caused by technical issues, or legal issues.

I did some rough math to satisfy my curiosity. If we assume difficulty remains static at its current value, four hashes per second would take on average 1.7 trillion years to produce a block.

English is clearly not the primary language of the author of the article either, so don't feel bad. The upgrade makes batch signature processing possible (blocks can be validated much faster and with less power) and adds support for key aggregation which will reduce the size of many bitcoin transactions.

I just googled "gox midas" and this was the first result. Looks like a new, more robust trading engine.
