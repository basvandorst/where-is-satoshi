Alright guys, It just finished downloading everything.. And the end-result is not what I expected, but in the end I didnt really wanted to expect anything at all.
Lets start with saying that it was not 0 BTC..&gt;! !&lt;
When the download nearly finished, I could not refrain myself from having a quick sneak-peek at the Blockchain Explorer, like some of you have advised me to do.At first thought I didn't  want to know what was in the wallet, but eventualy I snapped and just had to check it.
So, with no further ado:


I could really hit myself in the head for not buying more at that time, but hey! It's a nice extra, and had some exciting fun!
I hope I'm not disappointing  any of you with the (a bit lower than hoped for) outcome!
I'm gonna get a model-version of my lambo, and hope to see BTC hit an ATH very soon!
Thanks for sticking with me on this wild ride!
Edit:  
Said it was 0.0246. It was 0.246..

Will deliver as soon as it's finished downloading

I've got no clue how much is still on there..
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:54:21
As of now its going to take at least 10 more hours. I'm not going to check what's on there before it's finished.

Thanks for the heads up. Knowing myself I wouldn't dare putting in a lot of money 6 years ago. Probably not gonna be anything worthy
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:44:03
Update: started downloading now, gonna take about 40 hours!
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:34:27
Buy! Never really got into the mining thing
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:34:03
Quick update, were still 8 hours away. Processing about 5% per hour, were at 50% now!
Excited, but also a bit worried and pessimistic about even having coins there..

Replied somewhere else that im not checking it until the complete download is finished.

Never really looked into bitcoin at all..!
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:33:54
Not yet.. stil waiting for it to finish downloading!

I really don't feel the need to defend myself. I'm not a Bitcoin-expert, but I think I know what I'm doing.

Still waiting for the update to finish! Playing some ESO, if someone wants to join :)
