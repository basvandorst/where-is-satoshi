At one point it was 18.5K on Korean exchanges and 14.3K on most others. It'd be nice to have some Korean friends so we could exploit that. Surely there's people doing it

Don't buy a coin, buy $5 or $500 worth of a coin... having said that I'm not buying more until another decent drop

Your comment makes me so sad. 
Do some research on the technologies some of these cryptocurrencies are aiming to or have already achieved. Projects like substratum, golem, ripple, ethereum and bitcoin are all solving real-world problems within finance and many other sectors. There's hundreds more great start-ups and hundreds more which will just fail and/or could quite accurately be called a ponzi.
Don't call somebody stupid if you've only ever read one side of the story, you'll sound stupid.

Did this hit the front page or is everybody in here always this dreadful and negative on crypto?

An absolute shit show. It's very depressing how people are so dismissive without doing an iota of their own (balanced) research

Other than GDAX where else can you buy BTC with Fiat with low fees?
I've been waiting to hear back from Coinbase for about 2 months as they won't accept my verification - therefore gdax is out the window and I've been using a platform called CoinJar. They accept AUD which is good for me but fees are pretty horrible - then I have the fee to send to bittrex and then the fee to withdraw from bittrex. My precious coins :'(
