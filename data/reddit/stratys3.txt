I think he meant: 
It was designed to be used as a currency. 
Right now it's working more like gold.
Even these subs are encouraging you to *stop using it like a currency*.

People are less likely to spend it, and more likely to hold onto it.

I don't know where the floor is, but the knife is clearly moving pretty damn quickly right now.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:22:31


In total.
Bitcoin isn't like a company stock. A company *creates new things of value that didn't exist before*. Bitcoin doesn't really do this.
Bitcoin is more like gold. It can appreciate or depreciate in value, sure, but gold doesn't make more gold... 1 pound of gold will always be 1 pound of gold. Gold doesn't make *new gold*. It's not a chicken or a cow. It's not a company. It's intrinsically static.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:13:56
Last couple days, the knife has definitely been falling. 
If it stops moving, it might be safer to pick it up at that point. Will it be the absolute bottom? Who knows. Maybe the knife didn't fall on the floor, but just fell onto the counter instead. Either way, it's generally "safer" to pick it up once it's more stable, and not while flying through the air.
Where it'll end up, nobody knows.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:21:34


How could he do that, exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:34:47
But I think it highlights the problem with bitcoin as a currency. It's deflationary (bad), and it's being used as a speculative investment (bad), and it has high fees (bad).
These things aren't bad on their own... they're just bad for a *currency*.
I can see the fee problem being fixed, and maybe speculation will go down over time too. But it being deflationary probably isn't too great.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:59:08
Cheating people out of what they're owed... isn't a very supportable argument.

How often do people get mugged out of tens of thousands dollars or more?
Additionally, I have 100k in the bank. If it gets stolen, I'm still protected.

The system has value. But my individual holdings will not generate new value.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:22:07
Most people think investing in Bitcoin is like investing in stocks or bonds or in a company directly... it's not at all obvious to them.
A company generates new value/wealth that didn't exist before. Holding bitcoin doesn't generate anything new.

I'm happy for you, even if no one else is! :)

70% of people have and use credit cards, for example. Compared to that, bitcoin absolutely does not have "plenty of people".


Guess what: It doesn't matter. My cash, my bank accounts, and my credit cards are insured one way or another. If it gets stolen, I get reimbursed. I don't actually lose anything.
This is very significant, and a critical factor for most people.


If no craftsman can wield your hammer... guess what? You've designed a shitty hammer.
If you design a hammer for people with 3 hands and 14 fingers, and no one buys it or uses it properly, don't blame the end user - I'd blame the hammer and/or the hammer's designer, obviously.
In its current state, bitcoin is a tool for people with 3 hands and 14 fingers. It's designed for an extreme minority of people.

They likely haven't hit the floor yet.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:30:07
That only applies to you if you mine.
If you buy 1 bitcoin, it's not going to magically turn into 2 bitcoins all by itself.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:50:01
Why try to catch a falling knife, when you can just pick it up off the floor.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:49:00
When you sell it, you're just taking someone else's money in exchange. Nothing new was created in the process. (Unless you mine Bitcoin.)
This is why people (albeit incorrectly) consider it a ponzi scheme. People are just shuffling money around between each other. Nothing new is being generated. It's not a *productive* asset.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:53:45


The human usability of bitcoin is a part of bitcoin. It's all one package.

What country do you live in where there are no free bank accounts??
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:02:41
Personally? I'd wait for the knife to stop moving before picking it back up. Though I understand if that's too low-risk for the people in this sub. (That said, there have been weeks where bitcoin has NOT fluctuated by thousands of dollars... and this week is not one of those weeks.)
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:20:46
What's wrong with that, exactly? (Serious question.)
It's not designed to be an investment that grows. It's inflated deliberately.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:49:45
Price appreciation isn't technically the same as generating new value/wealth.
1 ounce of gold will always be 1 ounce of gold (like bitcoin). It can go up and down in price, it'll always be 1 ounce of gold.
10 chickens, however, can create 100 new chickens. Those new chickens didn't exist before. Companies do this too: They create new value/wealth that didn't exist before. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:29:08
Technically, it's not a ponzi scheme. I think the word you're looking for is "bubble".
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:36:50
Technically, Bitcoin isn't generating new value. 
ETA: It's not a *productive* asset. It doesn't produce anything. It's more like gold, than a small business.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:04:33
This is true, and I don't completely disagree.
I do think investing in "productive" investments (eg a business) is better than a "dead" investment (eg gold). Bitcoin doesn't produce anything on it's own. It doesn't produce value or wealth, it just appreciates (or depreciates).
But yes, people do need to eat. And money left over gets invested in funds or the like... bitcoin probably won't change that too much. More will invest in crypto than in stocks/bonds over time... but I'm sure whether investing in stocks/bonds really adds value, unless you're one of the original IPO investors.
Then there's the fact that while bitcoin is deflationary... the crypto market itself is infinitely inflationary. So maybe in the end not much will change anyways.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:19:16
Exactly. Bitcoin is more like gold than it is a currency like USD cash.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:47:35
Companies generate new wealth and value that didn't exist before. 
If I invest $10,000 in an app-making company, for example, they'll use that money to make an app. If I invest $10,000 in a company like Tesla, they'll use that money to make a stylish and well-designed electric vehicle. If I invest $10,000 in a company like Google, they'll use that money to create new softwares and platforms.
Companies use labour to create new things. 
Bitcoin is more like gold. If I buy $10,000 of gold... that gold doesn't magically create new gold. It's not a "productive" asset or investment. Gold, or Bitcoin, doesn't produce anything like companies do.

Companies and businesses can actually generate value. Bitcoin doesn't.

I live in a big city where it's useless marrying someone who earns 50% or less than you. You won't even find a place to rent, because you won't have enough money. Most women I know here earn at least 80% or more of the man's salary. 
If they have kids... the wife must continue to work. At best, she gets a couple of paid years off.
Marriage is a 50-50 deal... and here at least, most women contribute their fair share (ie 50%).
Even if you divorce, alimony is limited in duration, and if her income is comparable to yours (eg 80%), then you pay basically nothing anyways.
I don't know a single person from school who married a wife who isn't working full-time and isn't making about the same as the husband.
That said... I get that this doesn't represent 90% of the world. If I was living elsewhere, and women weren't working there... I wouldn't marry any of them either. I'd consider marrying someone who's a real "partner"... but I'd never marry someone who's basically an unemployed and uneducated homeless bum. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:02:41
Let's say I have a bitcoin you want to track.
I take that bitcoin, and deposit it into a "bank" (or you can call it a "blender" if you wish).  The bank has 100,000 bitcoin in it, and has 10,000 bitcoin deposits every day, and 10,000 bitcoin withdrawals every day. I leave my bitcoin in there for a month, and then I withdraw it.
How do you know which bitcoin is mine? 
In the span of that 1 month, there have been 300,000 people who have made withdrawals. Are you gonna track every one of them? How? What if that number isn't 300,000... but 300,000,000? What then? 
Once my bitcoin goes into that blender, you can't be sure which is mine anymore. Sure, everyone who withdrawals gets linked together into your potential investigation... but if the number of linked accounts is in the thousands or millions, then it's not gonna help you much.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:43:11


Fair enough. Those things are more similar to gambling/betting.

Do you know how much pussy you can buy with that much bitcoin? If you want pussy - you're wasting money by spending it on a middleman (the car). Buy direct.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:58:37
It doesn't have to be life-changing for it to make sense to cash it out. Take out 50% now. If it goes up, you can take out 50% again. If it goes up more, you can take out another 50%. 
You can keep taking out 50%... while at the same time having the amount of value you have in bitcoin go *up*.
That said, there's no reasonable way you can expect $100 or even $1000 to grow into a life-changing amount of money. The universe generally doesn't work like that.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:42:16
But it's insignificant. When Bitcoin goes up in value from 5k to 20k... that's not because of newly added coins.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:47:57
Other investments generate *new value that didn't exist before*. 1 bitcoin is still 1 bitcoin... it doesn't magically turn into 2 bitcoins. It's not generating any new value.

Yes, people are controlling the USD, and sometimes it's hard to trust them.
On the other hand, no one controls bitcoin in the same way. But there are pros and cons to that as well.
Ultimately, you can't make more bitcoin... but you can still have a "golden bitcoin asteroid". The big holders can sell, but more importantly, you can simply have a new digital currency become popular, and the value of bitcoin will likely then go back down.
Bitcoin isn't as foolproof as people assume.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:47:34
Wait... so you haven't actually sold any bitcoin yet? You haven't converted to cash?

Companies generate new goods and services. Bitcoin doesn't.

Something that has inflation (like USD) is a good currency but bad investment. If you have USD, you're better off spending it than holding it. The design of the USD encourages it's use as currency, by making you want to spend it ASAP. It's designed to be a bad investment, and it punishes you for holding.
But something that has deflation (like Bitcoin) is a good investment but a bad currency. People will stop spending their Bitcoin, and try to collect as much of it as possible. The nature of bitcoin encourages it's use as an investment, by rewarding people who hold onto it. It discourages it's own use as a currency, however, because people are punished if they actually spend it and use it to buy stuff. (And I don't mean fees, I mean if you spend your Bitcoin now, then you are basically losing out on potential future gains.)
Can something be a great investment and a great currency at the same time? I mean, you can't *hold and spend* something at the same time... it has to be one or the other.
Either something is a good investment, or a good currency - but I just don't see how it can be both? Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:37:50


They are, aren't they?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:06:58


Generally no. But people can. And if you do, then your bitcoins can become anonymized.


Correct. (Unless you choose to tie it to your identity.)


It is.


Same way your bank down the street does it. They have 1 big vault with everyone's cash in 1 big pile. But they have records showing how much each customer owns.
If the records get released, however, then obviously you lose your anonymity. So it's not guaranteed.

If someone is worried about their property and future earnings... then they shouldn't marry someone who is unemployed/unemployable.

When you buy a stock, you buy a part of a company. That part of the company can generate and create new value that did not exist before. Buying bitcoin doesn't generate *new* value. Bitcoin doesn't really create anything. It's more like a currency than it is a company or business.
