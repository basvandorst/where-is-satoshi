I think it is quite plausible there's a hidden meaning or double entendre somewhere in there.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:31:39
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:23:54
Governments have been trying to undermine privacy for the last decade. I see no unusual timing here.

The MitM idea seems like the most reasonable given the alternatives, and yet the least "Occam's razor"-y.
electrum.org uses a recent version of TLS and HSTS. It's essentially impossible to do a straight up MitM. You also can't do an sslstrip attack, due to the HSTS.
In theory, Gavin may have navigated to a site other than electrum.org for the download, or followed a link on a compromised site to reach electrum.org. But it seems pretty farfetched.

I agree this whole thing feels a bit shady for a variety of reasons, but the insistence that Wright absolutely *cannot* be Satoshi is skewing towards the other side of irrational.
Satoshi is not some sort of god or saint. He had a clever idea, some programming experience, some fundamental cryptography and crypto programming knowledge, and nothing else. A million or more people around the world could have done what Satoshi did if they came up with a similar idea.
We like to think of him as someone highly benevolent and ethical and intelligent, but since all we have is a bunch of old forum posts (where he may be putting on something of a persona) and a paper, we can't make any real assumptions about his personality or character. 
I think it's quite plausible this could be real. At the least, it's more plausible than the Dorian story. Let's just see if we can get (more) public cryptographic verification from him.
edit: Turns out it almost definitely isn't real. Though I still maintain it's more plausible than Dorian.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:34:57
Yeah, that's not plausible. Dozens of news outlets have been reporting about the skepticism of Bitcoin experts for the past few days. The ATO isn't that dumb.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:48:09
HSTS actually can't be served over HTTP, only over HTTPS, so the header itself can't be stripped.
However, you're right that if he didn't visit electrum.org before the meeting then HSTS wouldn't have helped at all against DNS poisoning. HSTS is only useful if you get a chance to visit a website at least once before an attack.
So, the attack is definitely theoretically doable. IMO it's unlikely, but it's plausible.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:54:55


But he just told a ton of media outlets that he's Satoshi!
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:42:38
He's Satoshi!!
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:01:58


To what extent? Source?
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:11:47
Definitely. I think that graph is probably indicative of his real sleep patterns, but it's impossible to deduce his real location just by his sleeping habits. Some of my coworkers are consistently up at hours that would make you think they lived in Europe.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:13:00
Satoshi's identity does not matter at all regarding Bitcoin itself, obviously. This is a given. Everyone here understands the core non-authoritative concept of Bitcoin.
However, someone falsely claiming to prove they are Satoshi does dramatically affect Bitcoin's public reputation, image, and userbase. Bitcoin is math, but Bitcoin users are still human. Dealing with these claims rationally and objectively is important.
So, I disagree with your reasoning for refusing to be involved with the process. I could understand the bad ethical implications if the task was to investigate and identify Satoshi against his own will, but if someone is wittingly claiming they are Satoshi, then IMO that claim should be either confirmed or denied.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:52:28
Look at my post history and then please tell me how sure you are I'm a shill.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:06:59
Yeah, if you actually read the blog post it hardly makes any sense (even though the technical guide seems correct). As someone else said, he probably just filled it with "technical gobbledygook" to bedazzle journalists and laymen and make him seem serious so that he'd get at least a few hours of huge publicity before it all came crashing down.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:24:54
Yes, I know. I just mean he clearly did not proofread anything.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:53:33
Huh? `signiture.der` is misspelled every time in that screenshot.
Edit: Nevermind, you mean the other bug.
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:04:22
Incredibly suspicious.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:39:29
* It's only been a few hours since this announcement. He might not have seen it yet, or might be asleep.
* He may choose not to do so for any number of reasons. He might consider it risky.
* He might be off the grid.
* He might be dead.
In any case, him not disproving it doesn't really mean much.
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:20:32
I don't know. He went through a ton of trouble, and does have basic crypto and programming knowledge (even if some of his knowledge was shown to be flawed).
I have no reason to think it's a psychological experiment; it was just a random guess. But either way, he *must* have known security experts would immediately call bullshit. Not only that, but even security novices could pretty easily see his claims held no water.
Something is missing here.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:29:54


Please tell me you're trolling.
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:20:44
Yeah, that's true. I was thinking something that only US companies would use, for whatever reason, though I know that wouldn't be of much use to SWIFT.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:58:15


That's sort of the impression he seems to be giving, now that I re-read it. But, again, why not just publicly prove it instead of only demonstrating it to a select few people?
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:58:09
Yeah, this whole thing feels a bit weird. Why provide just this *one* specific thing as proof? Why not sign anything else?
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:49:33
So he literally just copied and pasted a random public transaction signature (encoded to base64) and put it on his blog? (Edit: Nevermind, I'm not entirely correct. He copied the already publicly known public key and signature from a transaction Satoshi made. But it doesn't change the situation; anyone could have done that.)
I mean, something's gotta be wrong there. Someone going through all this effort for the con would surely realize that'd be debunked in like an hour (which it was).
He's obviously almost certainly not Satoshi, but I'm just left with more questions than answers.
Random theory: Was it totally intentional and part of a sort of "confidence game" publicity stunt? That is, the Sartre reference ("If I sign Craig Wright, it is not the same as if I sign Craig Wright, Satoshi.") being used to mean something like "I actually *am* Satoshi, but I'm not going to prove it because it'd taint my research too much" or some other bullshit reverse psychology type of thing?
The other theory is that his blog post wasn't intended to be a demonstration of how to verify he's Satoshi, and instead was just... a random primer on ECDSA. But that makes even less sense. If that is the case, all we have to go on is the supposed verifications he did in private with Gavin Andresen and Jon Matonis.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:34:38
Yeah, it's only been like 1-2 hours.
And him not disproving this does not somehow prove Wright's claim. He may choose not to do so for any number of reasons. Or he might be off the grid. Or no longer alive.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:50:36
If enough institutions back the private blockchain, it can be considered reasonably secure against the threat of criminals, while still allowing the US government to intervene in emergencies.
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:09:46
Sounds legit.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:12:07
So, you're right that the command is incorrect and wouldn't necessarily work as intended. You can even see the bash background job spawned with the `[1] 21359` and `[1] + Done` messages.
However, it doesn't necessarily prove the output is forged or anything like that. If `sig.asn1` already existed in the directory, perhaps from previous testing, then the `openssl` program would run fine. And even if it did not exist, since `&amp;` launches a background job, it could potentially create `sig.asn1` before `openssl` checks if it exists. It's a race condition, but in some cases the command would work exactly as intended.
On a side note, you can see he misspelled "signature" with `signiture.der`. So, 2 typos in one command... A bit embarrassing.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:28:04
You realize my post was literally saying the misspelling doesn't necessarily prove anything? I was disagreeing with the OP and made the point you're making right now. I'm just pointing out that it's embarrassing if this is intended to be the big 4-month planned reveal and info guide for journalists or whatever.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:58:56
I'm leaning towards the idea that Gavin genuinely thought he was Satoshi and was fooled, as were a few other people. Which is depressing. I know people here hate him, but I don't think he was in on it. He's incompetent rather than evil.
I think Wright does have legitimate crypto and programming knowledge, studied Satoshi's writing a bit, and was able to both talk the talk and use the charm common to all conmen to get them to believe it.
And from there all he had to do was take his laptop out and stage verifying blocks 1 and 9 in front of them. That could be done in various ways while still making it look like he's running actual signature verification commands. Essentially, he would've replaced one or more of the commands with dummy versions. Just about anyone with basic programming knowledge could do it.
The Economist seemed to confirm that the verification was indeed only done from Wright's own computer and was not independently verified by them:


Maybe Gavin or Jon did independently verify it despite The Economist not doing so. But they never said they did. And I'm betting they didn't.
If this is true, the only question is why supposed experts would just accept that and not independently verify it from their own computers.
All they had to do was ask him to sign a message with something like "Craig Wright = Satoshi" using the genesis block's address's private key and/or Satoshi's GPG key, stick the message and signature on a USB drive (which could potentially have malware, but probably unlikely to be effective against Jon or Gavin's computers without a zero-day), and have them plug it in and check that it validates.
Though even then: if he was really Satoshi and really wanted to prove it, he would have posted the message and signature publicly.
Disregard this post for now, I guess. I should read more carefully. Gavin claims he did independently verify it on a clean computer.


I think that leaves only two very concerning possibilities:
* Craig Wright is Satoshi.
* Gavin is wittingly collaborating with him in this scam.
@_date: 2016-05-03 02:21:30
That's fair. I can agree with that. I'm only addressing this part:


@_date: 2016-05-02 15:11:25
That is true.
Hopefully he provides more detail.
This is going to be *really* embarrassing if he tricked Gavin with this script.
@_date: 2016-05-07 04:15:50
False analogy. Anyone can still run scams based around Bitcoin, just like Madoff.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:50:55
Yep. Maybe less than a week.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:15:56
I agree it feels like a hoax. But I'm still curious.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:02:11


I don't understand. Why would he publicly verify block 9 but only privately verify block 1? What does he have to lose by publicly verifying block 1 at this point?
And no, I'm not looking for replies of "BECAUSE IT'S A HOAX DUMBASS". I'd like to try to see some valid explanations, because it still seems at least somewhat plausible he's Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:01:50
No, it isn't. It's some scammer either attempting to gain fame and publicity, or evade taxes.
Looking into it further than that is approaching tinfoil-hat territory. We have absolutely no reason to believe there's anything particularly nefarious here, with the possible exception of Gavin's endorsement.
@_date: 2016-05-03 04:01:46
I'm a programmer, and I saw the comments you're referring to.
What he wrote suggests programming knowledge, but not at an expert level. He's probably not writing code on a daily basis, but he can probably write an average C or C++ program if you ask him to. His programming and crypto writing sounds like someone with a decent general understanding of the fundamentals of CS and cryptography, but who is pretending to know a lot more than he does.
I'm like 95% sure he knew that crypto experts would not accept this as proof well before he made it. I think he does also have delusions of grandeur for sure, but still, I don't think he's quite *that* deluded.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:42:44
Excellent post all around. I, and a few others, have been trying to say similar things the past few days (about a decent chance of it being misdirection, and that he may not be smart but he's not *that* dumb), to no avail.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:53:02
That makes things more interesting. I removed that part from my post.
Not exactly "independent" verification. But either the "clean" computer wasn't really clean, or Gavin's complicit in the scam, or Wright has Satoshi's keys.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:41:37
Did you read the article?
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:42:00
No, he stole coins from regular people and then hid them from the government and pocketed the money. Big difference.
@_date: 2016-07-01 22:00:21
Yes. And if the warrant, when revealed, is shown not to cover what was taken, then the evidence is thrown out in court and you can't be charged based on it.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:02:47
Gavin claims he verified it independently, and suggests he didn't use any scripts Wright gave him:
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:59:52
Read Gavin's other comments. He claims he really did independently verify the signatures. There's really no room for mere "fooling" there.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:25:30
I agree. But *why* do this instead of doing the thing that would prove he's Satoshi?
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:15:48
No it isn't.
If you're standing around holding something important to an investigation that you could quickly destroy, a cop has no reason to show you the warrant before taking the item. They just have to show the warrant at some point.
@_date: 2016-07-04 04:35:52
Bitcoin's biggest risk is other, better cryptocurrency implementations. It has the current network effects, but in 10 years I predict Bitcoin will be pretty (or very) cheap and another, more modern cryptocurrency will be quite expensive.
I think long-term optimism about cryptocurrency is probably good, but optimism about Bitcoin in particular is risky.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:17:46
That's pretty hilarious.
Not too surprising, though. He comes across as a total idiot in the criminal complaint.
Glad to know a bit more about federal law enforcement recruitment standards.
