No, you just post that you want to buy/sell, and wait for someone to engage with you. If your market is empty, that's an opportunity for arbitrage more than anything as you could sell at above (other) market rates as you would be the market maker.

OP, If you think the question you asked makes sense, then I'd like to ask you:
What do you think Bitcoin is?

I'm not the dev, so I'll step in here,
You're the idiot every developer hates and your mere existence has turned the word "user" into a curse word. You are incapable of even entertaining the notion that you made a mistake, which makes it all the more painfully obvious that that is what you did. The fact that there is a tool to help people who only write down 11 words, also indicates that the number of people who write down their seed incorrectly is non-zero. 
Despite this tool (The use-this-if-you-only-wrote-down-11-words-tool) working for you as said, which I'm assuming he got that information from their internal support ticket/email system so they have proof they told you about this and you confirmed the sync; you're still claiming to be the victim of a bug that other people have experienced. If you could produce evidence of these other bug reports claiming a 11 word seed was generated, you would have somewhat of a leg to stand on, but as it is now, you're just a guy who wrote down 11 words instead of 12 and can't admit it to himself. This thread is a tribute to your arrogance and lack of ability to self reflect for but a moment about this. 
Even if you look at this as a pair of percentages, what is the likelihood that a human wrote something down wrong, compared to the likelehood that this application executed incorrectly for only you out of 3000 people? (That's the # of reviewers on both play store and apple store, I assume the real # of users is much higher but I don't have any data for that I can point to)
As for your swear jar, shove it up your shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits, this is the internet and cursing is allowed.

Again, if privacy brings you nothing, then don't worry about it. Just keep everything on public ledgers, I'm sure you'll never break a law on accident.

Implying that the functionality has been there since 2009, and examples of implementing said functionality (regardless of when they were created) are multisig and lightning.

The reward is using a decentralized privacy-first exchange? If that isn't an obvious reward to you, then you don't have to use it.

...what. Assuming you have linux installed, it certainly can do more things than run windows executibles/programs via WINE. Linux is literally a mish mash of different programs, so by definition by the time you are even just typing in your user/pass, you are "running linux applications". For instance, the linux program I use to login is called [lightdm-webkit-greeter]( I mean, unless your linux box literally won't boot or you interrupted a "sudo rm -rf /" halfway through, linux should run linux applications.

Not your keys, not your coins. This is unneeded and places an insane amount of trust in a 3rd party, it's antithetical to crypto. 
But it's a free market, so have at it.

Yes, I'm sure microsoft having access to every private repository won't be abused in any way at all ever.

Yes, I'm aware. That's why I would never use it. You feed this application money, and they purchase crypto for you and hold it for you, and then eventually sell it for you.
You can get all that sweet crypto trading action, without actually having any sort of self security and placing it all in a single 3rd party! It's retarded.

Github is centralized. 
I also work with Github daily, managing my companies repositories and ensuring proper gitflow is followed by my developers. So, no, I actually do understand what Github is, and Microsoft will have access to every private repository because Github is a proprietary &amp; centralized code hosting platform. 
So, will it be one bridge or two? If you buy three, I'll sell you a 4th for 1/5th off. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:21:13
Yes, which is why I store nothing personally on Github, and only use it when forced to by either my boss or clients. 
So, yeah, fully aware it's a shitty platform and you're handing over over everything you upload there to someone you don't know who is not incentivized in the least to act as a responsible steward, we're completely in agreement there. 
I disliked and didn't trust GitHub before, MS acquiring it just amplifies that.

I take XMR rather seriously, as it has fungibility. I'm sure there's room for a "platform" token too, they just don't really interest me.

One shipment of 5grams of methoxetamine from China was roughly 50% salt. Literally the only time I got "scammed". Largest purchase ever was 500g of 4-MMC and was domestically shipped. 
I had access to private forums though, and also safeorscam was still around.

So...you just make shit up then?
Current release is 0.17.1 on Dec 25th
Current version up on the AUR is 0.17.1, release out on....Dec 25th.
I'd elaborate further, but how quickly I determined you are lying makes me feel like I don't really need to speak with you anymore, as you will just lie to make a point. Have a great day, and please don't respond to me, I will ignore it anyways.

I've finally made a bech32 address, I had always gone File -&gt; Receiving Addresses -&gt; +New -&gt; Make an address, which certainly has no bech32 button.
The correct way, for anyone else puzzled, is to go to the recieve "tab", and there is a "bech32" button there to check when you create the address.

A thousand times this. The idea that you don't trust your repo for bitcoin, but do trust it for gpg and then use that trusted gpg install to verify bitcoin is....a futile circle of madness.

I'm already compiling 0.16 on my rpi and I'm curious, will a new wallet created in bitcoin-qt automatically be a segwit address?


Do I want to create a p2sh-segwit or bech32? If bech32 is better (I think), why is that not the default? 
In bitcoin-qt, to have the option for bech32, you create an address under the "receive" tab, NOT file -&gt; receiving addresses -&gt; New.
I honestly had never used the receive tab until today.

Unix is not a family of Operating Systems, it's a specification to be adhered to.
*nix is a family of Operating Systems. 
You're so close to accurately describing everything, yet you insist on butchering the terms despite knowing better. Carry on if you must, but it's rather non-sensical.

Well first off there is no "BSD", there are multiple BSD, and as far as I'm aware none of them are Unix certified, while Mac is. If being unix-like is enough to be Unix, then GNU (GNU is Not Unix) would also be a Unix, but that's not how it works.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:10:30
It's a certified Unix, regardless of BSD roots.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:48:47
That was more of a side question that I don't really care about. I just want to create a bech32 in bitcoin-qt. Now that I've compiled 0.16 the new address doesn't start with bc1, do you know how to make a bech32 with 0.16 bitcoin-qt?
