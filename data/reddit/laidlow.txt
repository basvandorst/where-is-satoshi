They're insured if there is a problem with their systems, they don't protect people against phishing attempts, hacked accounts etc. Which is where the vast majority of people come unstuck.

HODL MY HAND FOR ME
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:50:31
That’s just the tip of the iceberg with Kraken. They might have a lot of users but that site is garbage, the second there is a spike in traffic the whole thing will start throwing errors and you won’t be able to do any trades. Did a couple of months worth of trades there and won’t touch them anymore.

The real smart money is drawing down on their profit regularly. Loads of coins have made 500-2000% gains in the last year, if you’re not converting some of those profits back into hard currency you’re asking for trouble.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:38:43
It might not have been but it betrays your intentions. On one hand you talk about the banks being the root of all evil and then on the other you're talking about moonshots and being a millionaire. Can you not see the hypocrisy?
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:17:44
This is why I hate the HODL mentality. I was told again and again not to sell in January but I did because I couldn't bear to see any more profits disappear, turned out we hadn't even come close to the bottom and I'm damn glad I sold. Reinvested that money in the stock market while I waited for the bottom and then got back in when things settled down.
Now I think about things far differently, I have prices picked out for all my investments and will take profits again as soon as those prices are met. Sure I might miss out on some all time highs but I'll lock in profits and an ATH is almost impossible to pick anyway. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:22:29
What the fuck are we looking at? Put some damn effort in at least. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 18:11:32
1) Never leave money on exchanges you aren't prepared to lose. Ideally you should never leave it there but if you're trading regularly some will be prepared to take the risk.
2) Get a hardware wallet (Ledger or Trezor, accept no substitutes)
3) Don't talk about how much crypto you have with ANYONE, especially in public forums. Quickest way to put a target on your back.
4) Don't use shitty exchanges. If they will let you deposit without filling out a KYC form then run the other way.
5) If using a new exchange do a small deposit and then make a withdrawal. Far too many people have thousands of dollars invested with no FIAT gateway to withdraw, don't be like this.
@_date: 2018-08-17 01:24:43
Took profits in January. Reinvested in April.
This HODL shit is fucking moronic.

I love how this place is sweating the pullback when we've had nothing but green candles for weeks. I'd be way more concerned if it kept going without any resistance.

I'm so glad I bought some the day before the pump, feel no urge to FOMO. If it keeps trending up awesome, if it drops again I've got money waiting for more DCA.

Converted 80% of my holdings a couple of weeks ago and selling the rest once some transfers clear. I feel like the only reason the market went so high in nov-dec was new money and major market speculation, now the new money has dropped out we’re seeing the reverse.

I don't buy into the hodl meme, people use it like a once size fits all rule but it's anything but. Just look at Bitconnect HODLers. 
The rule of 'only what you can afford to lose" is far more appropriate IMO. When I started that was my mantra and I stuck to it. And when my investment reached levels I couldn't afford to lose I sold. Yeah I could have lost potential profits, but as it was I locked in profits (never a bad thing) and then watched prices fall for over a year.

I'll sell, for a house.

Yep you need to have targets set for selling, otherwise you'll realise it turned into something you weren't comfortable with losing after the chance to sell is gone.
