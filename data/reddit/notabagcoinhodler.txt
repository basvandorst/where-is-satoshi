Incorrect, they took the Mtgox price out starting Febuary 9th
For instance the average price that the site states was $599 on Febuary 21st, but MtGox was at $91.50-$108 on that date.
I did a rudimentary calculation on this date myself using the major three exchanges, and got a price of ~$270.

'YellenBux' doesn't go up or down in value like a penny stock each day
Bitcoins are treated as an 'investment'/gamble, not a currency
You are trying to get kids to gamble on your shitcoins because informed adults won't, so that when they put their money in, you can cash out and get your money back. Thankfully, that isn't going to happen.

It's funny because less than a month later (that was posted on March 23rd), the price fell to ~$339
Also, momentary bumps on the way down do not impress me - here, take a look at the bigger picture and educate yourself:

Invalid - they took MtGox out in Febuary for instance (put it as '0' in volume).
This is one of the reservations I had about using these sites at the time, which I stated in another comment.

See my other post, they took out MtGox early

What do you think about trying to get young kids to buy Bitcoins by the ol' 'rebel against your parents' tactic?
I guess as a bagholder yourself, you'd support it

Well you better pay up then
Bitcoin is at zero on MtGox and more recently hit $102 on BTC

What's the 'holy shit' for? What's the big deal?

And less than a month before that post of mine, the price was down at $400 - and a month *after* the post, down to $340. And now up again temporarily.
What matters is the long-term downtrend. 3 months is not long-term. I don't put dates on my predictions for a reason. I do however provide certain price points which would falsify my prediction. I stated that the price could not go over $1242 when I made my prediction in December. The price was in the four digits at the time, and now look where it is.

Look at the MtGox price and volume charts and you'll see that Bitcoins changed hands at $91.50 on the 21st of February
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:24:42
Yes, really.
It is disgusting that Bitcoiners are trying to take advantage of young kids.
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:51:13
Moving the goalposts just shows you are not a man of your word.
The fact is that thousands of Bitcoins switched hands on MtGox at prices below $100 in February.
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:29:32
What bet?
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:03:04
And if Bitcoin fell to zero and thus all the exchanges went bust, you'd say 'Bitcoin isn't worthless, because they aren't changing hands!!!'
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:32:55
You're right, I should have kept in mind the fact that Bitcoin is already used by child molesters and child pornographers when writing my post as though I were surprised by this recent turn of events.

Just took a random point in February and calculated the average of the three major exchanges (MtGox, Bitstamp, Bitstamp) as ~$270
Pretty sure you could find a date where it hits under $200
Not that it matters anyway, because we'll get there in due time
I said to someone who wanted to make such a bet with me, it might have been PSBlake or Judah_mu, that it probably won't hit $200 for quite a long time, as downtrends take a long time before they reach their bottom. I said at the time that I probably wouldn't be on this subreddit anymore by the time it goes under $200.
