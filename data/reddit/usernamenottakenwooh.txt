They celebrate a price spike like they won the lottery... but they are not cashing out and realizing the win, oh no. They shout "to the moon"! while their gains are only on paper.
And then the price crashes and they panic sell, realizing a loss.
You just have to keep your cool when the paternoster lift goes through the basement...

Lawyer up.
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:40:44
I gladly take your vote either way.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:05:51
You and me both. Fuck Paypal and their fees.

The day Apple starts using Bitcoin, we have won. I'm sure. If this is the way to get them to change their mind though, not so sure.

Maybe this is just me, but

Every breath you take and every move you make    
Every bond you break, every step you take   
I'll be taxin' you
Every single day and every word you say    
Every game you play, every night you stay    
I'll be taxin' you

My interpretation goes in this direction as well.
On another note, judging by the small number of replies, I should have asked this question in instead.

I'm sure he loves every minute of it, he lives for this!

I think I can trust a lesbian cow on this one.

Tell us more! Link?

Standard share for money laundering on the black market is 10%, they got less than 0.1%, lousy.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:09:12
Two lesbians together, what are the odds?

Thanks for setting the record straight!
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:30:55
Since when?
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:19:39
USD will take a hard dive.
Maybe not in the short term, but over the next two years for sure.
@_date: 2016-11-10 09:25:24
True. about $397.500.000
@_date: 2016-12-02 14:01:09
Possible, but their currency is artificially devalued, so I wouldn't count on it.
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:17:47
It is not a zero sum game.
Zero sum game means that if you subtract all debts from all assets you should be left with a nice zero.
But the way our economy works, you will be left with debt. And a lot of it.
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:04:21


Thanks to interest, there is more debt than there are assets.
The debt can't be repaid, by design.
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:37:45
You're right. There is only one problem:
Owning debt is a bullshit snowball system:
Party 1 lends some money from party 2. Party 2 now owns the debt from party 1.
Party 2 lends some money from party 3, providing the debt from party 1 as a security.
Now this carries on until a critical mass defaults and the whole economy collapses.
Money should be a representation of tangible goods and services.
Whenever the interest owed grows faster than the actual goods and services provided in society (which are needed to actually pay back the debt) the system will inevitably collapse.
Summed up this means 2 things in my opinion:
1.) Debts are not a *real* asset
2.) Maybe we need a better system...
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:47:33
And that system would be...?
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:40:12
It's a risk they take, and the potential gain they stand to make makes it worth it to them. Also there are bailouts, like in 2008.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:04:54
I am looking forward to the future of crypto currencies in general, an exciting time for sure.
@_date: 2015-03-28 23:40:05










Pretty much, yeah.
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:53:33


Once again: It is too volatile for that. We can forget that until rollercoaster guy is very very disappointed with his ride.

People here don't like to hear it, but here goes...
With regard to basic statistics, Bitcoin will come down again in the following weeks, by a couple hundred bucks.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:05:44
Go fork yourself.


What will happen? We will have two weaker communities. And a lot of confused newcomers as to what the "true Bitcoin" is.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:54:10
Damn right.

Civil Asset Forfeiture is state-sanctioned theft, nothing more nothing less. It needs to be abolished in its current form. I am not saying the state shouldn't be able to seize assets, but there absolutely positively NEEDS to be due process and a trial.

Tell me about it. When I first heard about bitcoin, I thought it either would fail miserably or be a huge success. Being broke at the time, I wagered for the former.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:23:05
How about a new startup? 
Call it bitdonate, kind of a proxy donation service... you transfer the bitcoins to bitdonate, and bitdonate donates FIAT money to the charity of your choice.
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:05:26
Oh, I see... I am still new to all this, sorry!
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:59:02
Fair enough :-)
