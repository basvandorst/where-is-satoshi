I'm saying that both kinds of libertarians exist, but contend that what you argue as common isn't reality. Secondly, it is possible to consider taxes as bad, but support some of it for practical reasons as a necessary evil. Or not want to financially support the current government on the basis of how that money is spent, but would support taxation if it was spent differently.

KYC issues can be dealt with by connecting to their bank account. In Canada, Interac deals with debit cards, and has an online service that allows you to pay from your bank account, where they act as a middleman to protect you from the merchant. Since Interac has such a close relationship with the bank and government, they satisfy KYC requirements without requiring any information from you directly. Thus, an exception is allowed for a bitcoin service to allow people to purchase bitcoin instantly without having to give the service any information about them. No registration or anything, just type in how much you want to buy then click a button.

Visual Studio? I keep Windows on the side just so I can use VS since I find it's organized way better than anything in Linux. And by organized, I mean arranged in such a way that it matches how I personally think. The only thing I hate about Windows is how much harder it is to integrate libraries on my system. If Visual Studio was ported to Linux with EXACTLY the same interface, I would be sooooooooooo happy.

The to the moon thing is just a fun little joke anyway, it's not meant to actually suggest that we'll see endless uninterrupted growth. There seems to be a growing gap between those in the know and those who aren't.

Yea I was verified the first time next day, about 2 months ago. Their verification process is different now, so I had to reverify to use preauthorized debit last week. I can't remember how long it took exactly, but it was somewhere around 2 to 4 hours. Communication with them is refreshingly fast compared to every other exchange I have used. Cavirtex has recently got faster, but still slightly behind in my experience. Not to mention being pricier.

Maybe in the long term, but in the short term it is really ify. I'm not confident that it's suddenly going to shoot up 500% in a few days if I spend my bitcoin. Actually, I'm a little worried about it plummeting, because it seems like bad news comes out of nowhere and affects the price within minutes. So I'm happy to spend. Plus, I know that I can buy more if I see something happen that is likely to send the price way up. So I'm not missing out. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:24:49
What I don't think you are understanding is that when you buy bitcoins on Coinbase, the coins are not truly yours until you withdraw. Before you withdraw, your bitcoin balance is just a number in their database, like an IOU. They have not actually given you anything yet. So it is Coinbase transferring to you, not you transferring to you. Thus, only one transaction actually occurs on the chain, and that transaction is between two separate parties.

I didn't say he or she lives in Saudi Arabia. I meant that this person would want bitcoin to be accepted in Saudi Arabia. If the Saudi's thought it was made by a female, then the perception might be that they might not want to use the protocol. It's about creating an image that could be accepted by as many cultures as possible, since the goal is for it to be used globally. 
I didn't say that Satoshi was female, just that it is possible. I'm not adding conditions. I'm removing the condition that Sotashi must be male.

Better exchanges already exist. The old shitty exchanges tend to take awhile to die though. So we have some decent places, but a lot of crap still.

Ugh, can we stop with the btc-e crap? Yes, they are annonymous, we get it. But they have not lost a large amount of coins that we are aware of. The common link here is exchanges that lost coins due to a bug, or from being fined, are the ones that get fucked. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:06:50
But how could they make a kill switch? I don't see how it is even possible. The code is all open source, there is no place to hide anything that could hurt it. 
The idea of making something to stop it is impossible. Even if you could stop bitcoin with some sort of voodoo, there are hundreds of alt coins ready to replace it.

You're not supposed to keep it in an exchange, at least you aren't forced to. Compared to cash it is equally secure. But in terms of ability to counterfeit, bitcoin is better. In the online world, bitcoin is more secure since payments are sent in a way that prevents others from charging your wallet with information from one transaction. Moreover, its value can't be destroyed by unexpected or hidden inflation. 
Keep in mind that this was developed in 2008 during the recession. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:55:35
Did anyone not already know this from the beginning? I thought the Megaupload case made this clear as day to anyone that pays attention. And this is why BTC-e is annonymous, and why it is so popular despite the implied risk. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:44:01
BTCe is a completely different situation. They have proven themselves to be competent. When Gox, Stamp, and Bitfinex would crash during a big event, BTCe kept humming along. Obviously there is still risk, and one should not put more in than they are prepared to lose, but to call people that trade there stupid is absolutely unjustified. Moreover, BTCe is being audited by third parties to prove their solvency. It is unlikely to be another Gox.

There are multiple forms of taxation other than income. That guy likely pays various sales taxes as well as property taxes to other levels of government that he supports. At any rate, refusing to pay taxes seems like an effective form of protest if you believe that government is using the money for evil. I don't think the US is evil, but if I did, I think it would be immoral to finance it. 
But the bigger thing I was wondering was why you were getting so emotional about one guy not paying taxes. I understand your reasoning for opposing on intellectual grounds. It just doesn't seem like something worth losing sleep over. 
You're obviously a socialist, which basically makes this a conflict of left wing versus right wing ideologies which will go nowhere. One would think that even an American socialist would be more accustomed to people who prefer freer markets and liberty in general.

If everyone flocked to it, they would have to buy bitcoins from current owners. So in the end, the current owners won't be at the top, but rather the first ones to buy after the crisis. So why take a risk at forking something that might be rejected? Moreover, if it is truly a crisis, how could current holders avoid selling while maintaining a roof over their head? Both parties win. Current holders sell at higher price, and first buyers after crisis enjoy the rise when everyone else starts buying.

Well there are many proposed solutions to this, so it's hard to generalize them all. The more common case though, is libertarians supporting different kinds of taxation. So opposing something like income tax, doesn't always mean opposition to all forms of taxation. For me personally, I prefer that taxes be used to discourage economic activity that could harm others, such as certain recreational drugs, or activity that damages the environment.

The people making these decisions can't be fooled by our use of words. It's not just the idiot congressman involved.

Everyone she interviewed said that he is an intensly private man. She clearly does not give a shit about him.

See the reason they ask for donations is because they actually need that money to run the site now. 
You can't just hold off paying rent to your landlord since it *might* be worth more later. Unless you want to be homeless. And if you think it will always go up, then why not just hoard until you die? Then it will be worth even more when you're not alive!... This is the problem with the arguement of why not just hold forver. At some point you need to buy shit. Secondly, while cryptocurrencies are more than likely here to stay, it is much less likely that bitcoin will always remain the leading coin. Therefore, there is a very real possibility that people will jump ship at some point, and bitcoins value will plummet down to nothing.

Can you point me to a single case where the US government caught someone who was using Tor in the way that is described on the website, via onion? You realize that Edward Snowden uses Tor to communicate with journalists too right? I strongly doubt that you understand Tor as well as you think you do. Setting up an exit node as a honey pot doesn't reveal anything when connecting to an onion address, and can't tell where you are connecting from without information acquired by other means. More importantly, the fact that the US government created this does not give them an edge. The strategies you mention can be done by anyone.

The utility of a currency attracts liquidity. The only thing that could hurt bitcoins liquidity long term is if a better alternative is created. If every single bitcoin holder sold all their coins, it would not alter the inherent benefits, and as such humanities self interest would cause people to start buying it again and continue its growth.  
Second, one could argue that cryptocurrency was an inevitability due to a new global environment that has pushed a demand for it. If Satoshi didn't do it, then someone else later on would have made something very similar.

I realize that is the intent. In practice, what it seems like is people promoting alt coins they invested in, and/or want to dominate for tipping. This would be fine if the tips were reasonable amounts, like a few dollars. That is how tipping started off when only bitcoin was used. I can't help but suspect that more inflationary currencies like Dogecoin tip much more cheaply because 100 doesn't look as shitty. 
If I were to tip, I would only use bitcoin, because it is the universal cryptocurrency. Therefore, anyone involved in cryptocurrency will more than likely be a user already, even if they use alt coins, since that is how you purchase them in the first place. And so far, I am not aware of any other cryptocurrency that offers any advantage over bitcoin for the purposes of tipping. You can't just "claim" that another currency is better for tipping simply because you stated it as its purpose. There has to be technical advantages. That's also one of the biggest problems with 98% of all the alt coins. They claim to have all kinds of specific purposes, but they don't offer any technical advantages over bitcoin in the context of that purpose. I really hate the idea of using different currencies for every little thing. It's a massive inconvenience, because it forces you to exchange for other currencies. We should be trying to move towards a cryptocurrency that can be used for anything.

Huobi still dwarfs BitStamp and BTCe. It's a shame that it is hardly ever listed, due to the baseless rumors about fake volume. BTC China is also comparable in size to BitStamp. China has four large exchanges, the other two I already listed. Bitfinex still does a lot of its own orders, and those orders are almost as large as stamp. The rest, although smaller than the top 8 giants, still make up a lot of volume if you group them all together. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 02:39:37
No to that last question. Bitcoin can easily work hand in hand with the dollar. Lost of people are in it just to make money, or for the network to save on remittances.
Bitcoin has too many problems to compete with the dollar, such as the block size issue which still hasn't been fixed, and the slow transaction times. Moreover, the fact that a miner can limit the number of transactions in a block, which further adds to delays, and sometimes causes transactions to never get confirmed. Some other cryptocurrency might take over the US dollar though. The freedoms of democracy do not apply when realistic threats to the state are involved. And money laundering plays a huge role in this. 
As for your points about markets, I'm a libertarian, so you don't need to sell me on any of that. My only point is that the powers pushing for money laundering controls vastly overpower anything we can do. It's a waste of effort to fight it directly.

The price in terms of dollars is a separate thing from the utility of the currency. It can't be compared to gas, because we don't buy things using gas.

Ah, I was not aware that pools had been decentralized. That is good to hear. But what about places like KNC which control a third of the networks hashing power? If not pools, then why not KNC and a couple other datacenters? Or just shut down other large mining centers so that KNC becomes a majority?
One other thought...Doesn't the concentration of hashing power to a few large datacenters create an incentive to physically sabotage competitors so that your own datacenter can take a larger portion of the block rewards? Seems that if Bitcoin keeps growing in value, then there would eventually become a point where the risk of using physical force and espionage against competitors becomes justified.

You're assuming all miners are rich which is not true. Second, what matters is even the rich don't like to lose money. And those who make lots of money in the traditional system are less likely to have invested in something unknown in the earlier days. 
Moreover, the potential for profit is needed to invest even a small portion of your wealth, even if you won't be homeless after. Money isn't in infinite supply for the wealthy, and there are thousands of high risk investments at any given time. Throwing money into all of them is both not possible, and also guaranteed to lose. If someone threw money into all those opportunities, which one happened to be bitcoin, then whatever they earned from bitcoin would be offset by their losses in the failed investments.

Considering btce was established waaay before the banning, I don't see how that would be it. To me this is just an issue of trust. There should certainly be exchanges like Stamp that comply with local laws in order to serve the demands of people like you who trust centralized powers. But there are a lot of people who don't trust governments the way you do, so I am glad there is someone that meets those needs. When discussing these things, personal policial leanings should be acknowledged, as I don't think this is the place to get into debates about whether socialism or anarcho-capitalism is objectively better.

Well the owners say they are in Bolivia, and [many articles refer to it as being based in Bulgaria]( Given that BTCe has offshoots in many different countries to deal with different currencies, the fact that their domain is registered in Russia doesn't mean much to me. Although, that does come as news to me, and would be very interested in learning more about that if you have a link. Since anyone from any country can register a domain in Russia, or through a Russian company, I'm curious as to how they managed to tie that to someone at a known location. 
*If* they are in Russia, they certainly are not a registered business there, and don't make their location known in any way. They have been breaking Russian law for a long time now, so as time continues to drag on, it seems less and less likely that the Russian authorities will be able to find them.

However, I feel safer sending bitcoin, because I'm not exposing my entire line of credit to the internet.

This is typically based on the idea it's the lesser evil of the known alternatives. Or just something that can't be done away with, so focusing on influencing and limiting it is the only practical option. When you're dealing with force, things get more complicated.

Why? What does Doge offer that Bitcoin doesn't? Further, what does Doge offer that a 100 other coins don't do better? One thing I've heard about Doge is it is more ASIC resistent, however there are other cryptos that do this better, in particular Vertcoin. I have invested a small amount in Doge to reap on the hype, but I sold two or three weeks ago. It's been plunging ever sense, and I see no reason why it would reverse at any point. The more interesting coins at the moment are Vertcoin due to its strong resistence to ASIC, and Darkcoin for offering better anonymity. Zerocoin will be a strong competitior as well once it gets released in May.

Due to the nature of the blockchain, if you tie your identity to an exchange, buy coins, then give those coins to someone else, and they use those coins for something illegal, you will risk taking the blame if you can't prove that you didn't transfer them to your self. There are a lot of legal issues that are not clearly defined or understood yet. Having your identity tied to an address will put you at incredible danger of being the victim of police and jury incompetence regarding the protocol.

Except none of these things were a secret.

Anyone that researched Vircurex would have easily found this out, and understood the risk that comes with running fractional. 
I don't hate the people that got burned in these cases.

It allows for what is known as "all in one" transfers. So sending a sum of money at once, yet distinguish portions of that sum with different transaction hashes.

Even that is hard. Look at localbitcoin.com. When you deposit cash at a bank for bitcoin, there is no way for the bank to know that you are sending money for the purposes of buying bitcoin. All kinds of excuses can be used. There is also the option of cash. If people are still able to buy drugs with cash just fine, then people will also be able to buy bitcoin. Except not everyone buying bitcoin will be druggies, and a lot of people in bitcoin are tech savvy. So I would imagine there would be much more creative and intelligent methods for purchasing that would be easier. Ie, decentralized exchanges which are in development.

Why does it need to be voluntary? It is already the case that law enforcement will force you to pay, and I don't see why any other law enforcement agency wouldn't do the same. And if one did, then another agency that does would use force to take over, which is evidenced by history and the current development. If you can force people to pay, then you can also force them to pay more than they would voluntarily. So such a force would be better funded, which is why they would win in a fight against a force that allows voluntary payment.

I thought his arguement was that it brought the price down to reality *after* the insider trading occured. The arguement isn't saying that insider trading removes all risk. But it does reduce it. As this graph illustrates, the sell off happened in very little time. And seeing a massive sell off is a clear warning, which is why the price drops so quickly, because everyone starts backing out.

But with such large pools, a third party would only need to breach the security of two pools to 51% the network. As for the commonly cited example of an attack from a government, with only a few dominating pools and mining companies, all it would take is for them to find these companies breaching some minor law to get a warrant and take control. 
I used to believe in your argument for a long time, but there doesn't seem to be any signs of new competition coming in to even out the playing field. Instead, it just keeps getting more and more centralized. And when I think about it more, the idea of the network depending on all this wasted electricity and processing power strikes me as rather ridiculous. Somehow it's got to be possible to secure the network with something less wasteful.

Yet here they are, without any problems. History has shown pretty damn clearly that the same shit can happen with a public identity. Yes, the government can sometimes recover and return some assets to some people, if there is anything left. However, government licensed exchanges aren't just at risk of the owner stealing and running, but also the government shutting you down by sudden changes in law. And so far many governments have done this.

Wales mentions the cost of the spread. However, that assumes people are buying bitcoin fore the sole purpose of donating, which I don't think is the case for most people.

Because it's an unfair trade. The tipper has an interest in getting people involved in bitcoin. Think of the tipper as an employer wanting to hire someone to learn about bitcoin. The tip then is the wage for taking time out of your day to do the task of learning this new thing. So, if your boss offered to pay you just pennies for an hour of work, would you feel that your boss respects you? Or values the importance of your time? 
The root of the issue is that you are only looking at your side, which is the money, and not seeing what the other person has to give up in exchange.

But objectively, the poor in third world nations are MUCH worse off than the poor in first world nations.

In my opinion, that's a good thing. We just need to start looking at humanity as a whole, rather than just our own nations.

The point is to not have the protocol centrally regulated, which it already is, and no government can change that.

If anything happened to those exchanges there would be tons of legal options to go after them, and they would face jail time. It's treated like any other kind of asset. It is NOT the wild wild west where anything goes. Bitcoin is not regulated, but when you put that asset into an exchange it becomes regulated just like any other type of exchange.

Satoshi speaking doesn't mean much in my opinion. Who he is is irrelevant, because the code is open source and understood.

The bitcoin devs should have listened to Satoshi and taken the credit themselves.

Well it just seems like governments are fucking up exchanges like BitInstant, and fines imposed on Gox certainly didn't help them stay solvent. It seems that if laws suddenly change, or interpretation of laws change, then being a registered business makes it very easy and convenient to shut down. Being anonymous, at worst, at least buys some time to react before a government can find them, and at best, offer complete freedom from the ignorant people with power. I don't feel comfortable when senile old men who control the monopoly on violence, have a say on how bitcoin is treated.

The blockchain only says what addresses the coins came, not who owns the addresses. That is the critical part you don't seem to understand. Once you have the coins you paid yourself, you just throw them into an exchange and withdraw with a new address, since exchanges mix everyone's coins together into one address. You don't need to buy USD with the coins you paid yourself. You can just buy stuff with it. No way for the IRS to know that the stuff you bought with it even exists. Even the most competent auditors would have literally no way to track the money. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:52:07
Why are you angry at me for trying to clear up your misunderstanding? 
Do you have the private keys to your Coinbase wallet? Is there a blockchain txid for the amount you purchase on Coinbase that you can point to? Coinbase doesn't work the way you think it does. When you buy bitcoins there, nothing happens to their hot wallet. They state right on their website that they keep the vast majority of their coins in cold storage. Their hot wallet is only for paying the IOU for withdrawals, and for moving bitcoin deposits. 
Edit: Okay I reread your comment. So you seem to acknowledge that there is no transaction on the blockchain. So now I am not sure what your point was, since bitcoin transaction volume is measured on the blockchain.

There is some inflation, but it is set at a predetermined amount in the code, and no one can change it unless everyone agrees to start using the update. Inflation at a steady low percentage isn't bad, the problem is when it is sharply raised without notice. There is no way of knowing what the inflation rate will be in fiat, because it is determined by a central authority that can make changes without consensus.

Many are not learning, because I have asked some what they should have done differently, in the case of Gox, and they really did not know. They were insistent that there was no warning, and that it was all Gox fault. Of course Gox was to blame, but it is usually clear who learns and who does not. When someone only talks about blaming the other party, it is a fairly good indicator that they do not think that they made any mistake. If there is no personal mistake, then there is nothing to learn.

I have no issue with the people that learned from this. However, there are far too many people denying all the warning signs and not admitting that that they should have done anything different. Those people need to be told that they fucked up because they still they don't seem to be realizing it on their own.

Do you really think that something like this is going to change their minds, as if they don't know all this already? They are going to do what they do, nothing this community does here or on Twitter is going to change things. We are not the gatekeepers of information about bitcoin.

Okay I reread your comment. So you seem to acknowledge that there is no transaction on the blockchain. Now I am not sure what your point was, since bitcoin transaction volume referenced by OP is measured on the blockchain.

Satoshi Nakomoto is a common name. It means nothing. It's like John Smith.

What does that have to do with this problem? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:17:32
There are tons of technologies where we don't know who the inventors were. The point is to simply show that the curiosity to know who Satoshi is is a waste of time that will have no benefit to humanity, and is more likely to cause harm, [as pointed out by Maxwell.](

I had never even thought about donating before, and just considered the donation requests to be an annoyance. But after realizing how easy it is to donate to things on the net with bitcoin, I've started donating to lots of things now. I would donate now just because it is way easier and faster. Before I got into bitcoin, I had never donated to a single thing in my life.

He didn't say that he had faith that it would not crash. From what I understand, the feature is to *let* natural crashes occur.

The support doesn't need to come quickly. I think the main thing would simply be to demonstrate how your new coin is an improvement or fix for an inherent problem in bitcoin that many people know about, or will likely know about in the future. And since it's all based in the Internet, word like this can be spread without spending any money. Just look at how Google got started. They did exactly this in the context of search engines, without an advertisement campaign.

From what I learned in school, it is to encourage spending, since you lose value in your money if you hoard. Thus, you need to spend right away to keep value.

How is it not both? I fail to see why the semantics are important in this context.

The competition I see happening is from differences in design. In particular, if one is more anonymous than another. And the innovators have a lot to gain from being the first to mine.

I didn't say it wasn't legit, just that   they give the impression that they don't respect the agency of their customers.

Yea except there will be bad reviews about you all over the net, so that stuff can't last for too long anyway. In the end the only people being scammed will be idiots, and idiots always lose money regardless of the monetary system.

This comment is such a "whoa" moment for me. Most of the logic in libertarianism has always made sense to me, however one of the biggest drawbacks I seen with it was things along the lines of providing services to people out in the country. 
I was having a discussion with a friend recently about what the population distribution would be best for the environment. From that the best I could think was for there to be fewer cities that are very dense. Reading your comment just made me realize that libertarianism would allow this more environmentally friendly distribution to happen. It's funny, intuitively it seems that more people living spread out into the country would be better for the environment, but when you actually think about it, it's the exact opposite.

For most, yea. But if you study the fundamentals of each acedemic discipline with the understanding of how they all relate to markets, and then allocate enough time to research the markets at each level, you'll be far more likely to make highly profitable investments. Warren Buffet, the Rothchilds, etc, are all examples of such cases. They put a lot of work and energy into their investments, and it paid off. If you're lazy and don't put any work into it, then I could certainly see how something like bitcoin could be seen as a gamble. Were you perhaps just refering to those kinds of investors?

Not all traders lose. I've been investing with an all in strategy for the past decade, and only once have I lost. Even then, the loss was small and insignificant. And it's not just me, there are many others who have done well for most of their entire lives. Many people who lose like to claim that investing in these kind of emerging markets is exactly the same as playing the lottery, but this just isn't true. I suspect it's a defence mechanism. Otherwise they would have to acknowledge that their ability to analyze information might be flawed. Since most people lose and use these kinds of defense mechanisms, these ideas obviously become accepted and popular. Obviously luck is a factor, but there are just too many people out there who consistently do well for decades for it to be explained entirely by luck.

From what I understood, it was implied that it was a prospective sale, not a guaranteed sale. However, the invasive nature of the website immediately causes a loss of trust. If the company is that obnoxious right at the entrance, which is assumed to be an attempt at giving the best impression, then odds are it can only get worse inside. 
These other websites you mentioned are successful because they target a demographic that is more receptive to that kind of marketing. The Bitcoin community is much more proactive and critical, as most early adopters in any product are. It should be obvious that they will not respond well to invasiveness. Do your homework next time, this is marketing 101 shit.

Would such an accomplishment be good for the long term survival of humanity? I was under the impression that competition was fairly important for developing better cultures.

What are you basing that on? You realize this is not the same as a casino right? It's a free market, it can't be controlled in the same way.

A surprising number of people in developing nations have smart phones though, or at least a regular cell phone where companies have made it possible to use sms to send and receive Bitcoin.

On top of that, not having to deal with charge backs will make it possible to lower the price. Sure, this may mean buyers may lose a little from problems with other merchants, but if you pay a little less on everything, then I  would suspect that it balances out for the buyer.
