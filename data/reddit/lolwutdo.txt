Are you able to cash out through Gemini in the US? I’ve been looking for the best alternative to Coinbase.

I checked them out, looks like you can cash out through BTC and ETH

I know it's still a bit out of the way, but what do you think will happen once Quantum Computing is achievable?

How am I supposed spend bitcoins if the prices keep fluctuating?

I always wanted to ask someone who would know the answer to my question, maybe you can answer it?
Can Bitcoin's source code be updated and improved upon? If so, how can Bitcoin be updated if no one can control it?

use something more private like Monero

It would make more sense to go with something like Monero given their stance on privacy.

So I can't use this on a wifi printer can I?

Thanks for the insight, I've always been curious about bitcoin having flaws and if it were possible to even fix the code.

You basically just repeated what he said, Idk why you guys keep downvoting him when he's technically right.

How does this work? Can bitcoin itself be updated? Who's allowed to update it?
I can never seem to get an answer whenever I ask these questions. Is bitcoin upgradeable or do people take the code and build something new with it?

Is bitaddress a web wallet?

We need to change PoW so we can start using cpu/gpus again; I feel like your average bitcoin user will never get an ASIC which leaves it open to the big miners. 
It would actually be cool if we could adopt Gridcoin's idea of using cpu/gpu power to help scientific projects out while rewarding miners with bitcoin; bitcoin burns through so much electricity that could be used for something good to help humans progress into the future.

ah, I see.

Okay, I've made a paper wallet with bitaddress a few days ago.. Where are my bitcoins actually going to when I give them the public address if bitaddress isn't a web wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:22:22
What are the chances of Litecoin surpassing bitcoin though?
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:47:10
Ah, makes sense now. Thanks for the explanation!
