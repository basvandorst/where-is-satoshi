SIMPLE IRAs are basically 401k's for small companies, I.E. employer, but I'm just being a shit head.
Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs are the two personal ones.

I scooped .13 BTC up at $1970, wish I checked earlier when it was ~$1800. 
You should have DCA'd and bought a bit at 1900 and have been ready to buy if it dipped lower, or just set up some limit orders. Live and learn my friend!

Whoa, hey, keep your voice down, let them sell so I can buy their BTC for cheap like I did four days ago.

I saw the activity today, said "well that's something," bought a bit more of both BTC and ETH at a discount and went on with the rest of my day.

Let me tell you something, Bitcoin hasn't even begun to peak. And when it does peak, you'll know. Because it's gonna peak so hard that everybody in the world is gonna feel it.
