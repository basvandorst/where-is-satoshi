Please expand.  I'm assuming there is no bug and his code uses OpenSSL just like bitcoinqt.  If so, their should not be a bug in the key generation, and brute force could be done on a human generated pass phase encrypted wallet, using knowledge of his past pass phrases.
Look at line 13, of the [bitcoin-qt code from github]( for wallet.cpp
99% of programmers use existing libraries when writing code.  I don't think Mark created his own random number generator, and if he did, we never should have trusted Mt Gox in the first place.

I'm in agreement with you on points 1-5, and never claimed that the debt was the problem.  
IOUSA's point is that the rate of spending is unsustainable. No one is saying we need to stop the debt, we just need to slow down the rate at which we are tacking it on.
Why do we need to be concerned with the rate of spending?  Because we are not going to raise taxes or see GDP keep track with the rates of spending.
Instead we are going to devalue our currency to make up the difference....and effectively tax everyone in the process.
So if you want to avoid the train-wreck that is most likely going to happen, bitcoin looks like a great option.

A real long shot.
All Sha-256 output that goes into ECDSA secp256k1, just provides a random binary 256 string to flip flop the add function of each round of calculation.  So it is unlikely any limited key space used in Sha-256 directly correlates to sequential keyspace output of ECDSA.  
Also the bitcoin Public key is a hash(full public key), so unless you reuse an address, the full public key is not knowable to a third party until funds are spent on an address.

- 168t4P2pBuyM7D7tmLKqgUVGfxZ4dvpktf - me
Here's the full detail on my one speculative transaction (my entire history with Mt. Gox):
 - I opened an account to try to take advantage of the arbitrage on 2/18
 - I funded the account with 0.10 BTC from coinbase on February 20, 2014, at 03:22PM EST
 - Coinbase lists this address 168t4P2pBuyM7D7tmLKqgUVGfxZ4dvpktf
 - The Coinbase Market price at that date/time was ~$580, making the value about $58 
 - Once the transaction hit Gox, I sold the BTC to cash, it sold as follows
  - 0.02 @ 110.31101
  - 0.58 @ 110.665
  - 0.01 @ 111.40
  - 0.01 @ 111.40
  - 0.01 @ 111.60
  - 0.01 @ 111.70
  - $0.07 Fees
 - I was then left with $11.0336 in cash
 - I then set limit orders to buy back in if it fell to under $10 USD/BTC
Someone point me to a resource to know if I can share the coinbase binary or json file associated with the transaction.  Coinbase only allows users to view it when logged in, so I'm unsure if publishing it will in anyway compromise my acct.

Occasionally, due to issues with the SMS network itself, these codes may be undeliverable to some users. To prevent this, it is recommended to use the Authy or Google Authenticator app for 2-factor authentication in your Coinbase account if possible, as these do not require internet connectivity or SMS coverage once they are configured.
