I'm serious, please explain to me how you envision people in the Philippines using bitcoins in this situation. Enlighten me.
@_date: 2013-08-23 03:41:42
If this is a real post then please see a doctor because you have literal brain problems.
I'm not even joking.

You stupid asshole.
The typhoon annihilated infrastructure. There is no water or electricity or buildings anymore. There are still parts of the Philippines that are completely cut off. There are no roads. There is no food, and the telecom infrastructure is still at ~50% even as aid agencies and nation-states scramble just to figure out what the damage even is.
Bitcoins depend on the existence of electrical and network infrastructure, and those things are fucking *gone.*
How the fuck are people currently scavenging through the rubble of civilization supposed to make use of those bitcoins?
How is somebody living underneath a propped-up sheet of corrugated metal and with literally nothing left to their name supposed to convert your bitcoins to something that they can actually spend to keep themselves alive?

To back up my thesis, that the idea is definitely super-wrong, let's compare the following two possible setups:
* Proper HVAC (which is really efficient at climate control) AND an ASIC (which is really efficient at mining).
* An inefficient mining rig which is also an inefficient heater, because it's optimized for neither.
The first one is obviously the better choice, because you're more likely to use less energy while getting better results in terms of both the heating *and* the mining.
Edit: All things being equal, there are still HVAC costs in more temperate climes. They may not be equivalent to year-round heating in the asshole of Siberia, but the delta is narrow enough.

"...politician's sensationalism is going to draw additional attention." There, done.
You're a touchy one.

Wait, what does this even mean? How is it a benefit of employment if the "free" electricity is going to your entire building? Is it company-run housing, or are you considering access to electricity during work hours as a "benefit"?
@_date: 2013-08-27 03:59:53
Heh, "invested."
@_date: 2013-09-20 05:07:04
Huh, he actually *was* paying attention. Guess his soul had yet to be crushed!
@_date: 2013-10-01 05:30:01
Oh, okay. That makes more sense, thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2013-08-17 18:41:15
The disconnect here is that you've generalized the effect far beyond the events that actually gave it its name. I think the phrase should really be reserved for those instances where somebody is trying to censor somebody else, and thus brings more attention to the thing that was being censored.
Oh, and that bit where you're all "since you seem to be struggling"? A little unnecessary so yeah, fuck you too.
e: I think the disconnect is in step one, where you have A simply "[doing] X to Person B". The understanding of the Streisand Effect that I've seen pretty much everywhere outside of, well, *here*, is that that step should be "Person A says X about Person B", with subsequent steps adjusted accordingly.

Stop digging.

People are dying. Right now. This is not the time to explore and try to implement new systems based on unproven (at these scales) technology.
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:33:53
What are you talking about, that is *definitely* super-wrong.
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:41:54
How do you get away with not paying for the electricity used by your rig?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:57:58
Dude, that's kind of racist.
@_date: 2013-08-18 16:58:03
It's strange to me how people here can't seem to fathom that people are able to come to different conclusions with the same information.
@_date: 2013-08-18 19:53:05
I'd characterize what I've seen as "making fun of" more than "attacking", but to each their own I guess.

I have thought of ways to help, and the most effective is to give money to relief organizations that do this for a living and are already engaged in relief operations. A hell of a lot more effective than sending bitcoins to someone for future use somewhere.
Worrying about money transfer fees for future remittances at this stage is useless at best, and actively harmful at worst.

As somebody who has had the exact same job as the man at the FedEx office, please allow me to clarify something for you; it's likely that he did not care, and was just making conversation in order to alleviate the otherwise soul-crushing boredom.
People who work at shipping stores are very good at holding conversations with people, maintaining the illusion that they actually give a shit.
Good for you for trying, since public awareness is one of many necessary keys to bitcoin's success, but front-line shipping guys are definitely not the ones that you need to convert.

Cognitive dissonance. Understandable, don't blame you really; if I was where you were I would probably do the same. Good luck little buddy.
@_date: 2013-08-17 18:27:51
It's not the "making a fuss" part that differentiates the effect. It's the irony of trying to censor something, and in the process drawing additional attention.
The irony is the entire point of the Streisand Effect. Otherwise, you could apply the term to pretty much anything. (Shouting for help after being stabbed? Streisand!)

@_date: 2013-08-17 20:00:00
Why would you think it did?
A disagreement in description of a thing is hardly "confusion and disarray".
@_date: 2013-09-19 19:09:44
No, but I think it's fairly safe to say that having held the same job for several years and interacting with people in similar jobs in a variety of contexts provides some basis for my opinion.
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:47:09
If the steady state is to break even, doesn't it follow that there would be no real incentive to mine other than the health of the network? You'd have no net profit, which would mean that any miners left in the post-subsidy world would be effectively *donating* their time and resources. Or are the transaction fees expected to be large enough to justify the time and expense?
@_date: 2013-08-15 18:56:14
FYI, that's not what the Streisand Effect is. The Streisand Effect is when a private entity attempts to censor a piece of information via lawsuit, which results in amplified publicity.
It would only be a Streisand Effect if politicians tried to censor all _mention_ of Silk Road or Bitcoin.

This article says nothing about your actual suggestion, which is to give bitcoins directly to people in the Philippines, bypassing established charitable organizations entirely. Rather, the article is about third parties who collect donations that are then transferred to those same charitable organizations for eventual conversion to a usable currency.
The article itself notes that the bitcoins "will be converted into U.S. dollars at the end of each month in order to be sent to the Philippine Red Cross."
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:54:41
I wonder if anybody realizes that this is a c/p of Bitcoined.
Probably not.
@_date: 2013-08-17 23:28:55
But there's no attempt to censor so there's nothing to be ironic about.
@_date: 2013-06-21 16:41:09
What the fuck is wrong with you?
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:58:51
Oh, I know *conceptually* how he's doing it. I'm just curious about the specifics.
