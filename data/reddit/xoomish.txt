Have journalists been covering these issues with the app store? If they are, I'd expect all of this to quickly improve.

Yes, "sudden" in geological time.

Energy. Since the bitcoin ecosystem requires a lot of electricity, I would think the price of energy might have some effect on price (e.g, maybe if energy goes down, we expect more mining and more security and maybe that adds value).

Because some small country will realize that it can accumulate bitcoin on the down low and then announce that btc is a (or the!) legal tender. That gives the price of btc a big boost and hopefully citizens benefit from the increased value of the government's assets. Plus, they get to use bitcoin as legal tender!

To those saying that big miners will exploit the proposal to choke off competition (and lead to centralization), why haven't the big miners unanimously adopted existing options to increase the maximum block size? If doing so is a good path for big miners, why have they been so cautious?

I wonder if the payment of state taxes in bitcoin could itself trigger capital gains for which one owes taxes. (Leading, of course, to the Inception-style recursive disappearance of the tax universe.)

This seems dramatically overstated. If Satoshi has/had a million btc, that would be, at most, about a 5% increase over expectations of the total long-term btc supply. If the market currently estimates a 50% chance that someone controls that btc, then the effect of coin movement on expectations would be even smaller. True, there could be a little panic, but even with worst-case assumptions, it seems more like a minor blip than a major crisis--certainly nothing to "render your bitcoins worthless."

Some questions about Satoshi:
(1) Many people seem to think Satoshi lost or destroyed about a million btc. Is there any evidence for that view, aside from the fact that somehow people know that Satoshi has/had a big stash that hasn't been used or moved?
(2) In Satoshi's white paper, the abstract refers to a "we". Is that significant? When Satoshi was in regular communication, did Satoshi explain why (or even if) he/she/they were anonymous?
(3) If or when Satoshi decides to step out into public again, will Satoshi have a way of definitively proving that he/she/etc. is the real Satoshi? (I know there was some prior discussion that Satoshi's email account may have been hacked, but I imagine Satoshi would have some method of demonstrating authenticity.)

I know that Coinbase talks a bit about its insurance on its site. I'd be interested in hearing thoughts about the insurance of Bitcoin enterprises in terms of effectiveness, comprehensiveness, etc. as to either Coinbase and/or its competitors.

Did they have a right to this appeal or was it granted as a matter of discretion? Anyone know the historical rate of reversal of such decisions?

I don't know if Armstrong would have a legally-enforceable agreement, such that, if a person took the bet and refused to donate to charity, Armstrong could sue. But I don't think these sorts of public charitable wagers are expected to be enforced in the courtroom as opposed to the court of public opinion.

So if there was a hack, would customers be insured for the value in hot coinbase storage as opposed to what customers put in cold coinbase storage? Or does this refer only to Coinbase's insurance and not necessarily customer reimbursement? So Coinbase might get back the value in its hot storage but that doesn't mean customers will be reimbursed in the same way, right?

I like that your imagined Satoshi would spell the last name "Write." That way, he'd divert attention from himself but still keep us all suspicious.

Investors are indeed speculating on altcoins, but some of that investment would have been in bitcoin if the market had greater confidence in its scalability.    So there's harm to bitcoin not only when users leave but also when investors leave.
