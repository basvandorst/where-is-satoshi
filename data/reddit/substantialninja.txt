I'll buy one of those chunky gold hearts for .01 btc one day
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:30:53
In other news apparently 2500 people had .25 btc to gamble and lost. Pay your respects below.

She's not dumb. They'll have her ID on file when bitcoin is more valuable and then the feds will know she is trying to evade taxes on her gains but they're actually your gains. You'll just have to pay the 9% unless you can turn your mom into a frothing bull willing to associate her ID with your btc stash.

hell yeah, started my new robinhood account with a bang, sold and put it into something with a dividend just to see how that works

Bitcoin transactions are not reversible once initiated which leads to many scams and even computer virus' that can leave you with a 100% loss of principal. While you're dreaming of private islands and exotic cars, hackers are creating more and more sophisticated means of stealing crypto currency or the electricity to mine it. Even if you are correct about the direction of the market you can still lose everything.

I imagine that's decent Karma. Think of all the people that invested in crypto before now but then had some technical snafu and lost all of their investment. Satoshi wouldn't be alone in that boat. Obviously satoshi has the biggest btc loss out of all of them though but maybe not in terms of initial capital risked.

Denizen. Which is the name of a mineral in 6 year old me's epic dream from over 30 years ago. Denizen allowed me to pause time and continue to act while time was paused. I can't really remember much of the dream anymore, but I remember the name.

Probably just a bitcoin core hot wallet, maybe a paper wallet. There might have been online wallets at that time, and of course you could always leave your coins right on the exchange.
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:24:04
Sadly, Last I checked XCP price didn't reflect the lost btc. I think I have some btc and xcp in a counterparty wallet somewhere. Probably .035 btc and maybe 30 xcp which I don't think is worth very much?
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:47:58
I think I'd rather leave my coins on coinbase than lose the keys like so many have before. How foolproof is a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:31:30
If it was zero we'd all have infinite bitcoin because the system broke. I think that would be more a surprising outcome don't you?

it could approach zero but never truly hit zero unless all humans were extinct perhaps.

I remember one time I put my whole paycheck into a mining contract and then realized it was a bad idea and begged butterfly labs to refund the $500 so I could buy a half a bitcoin and they actually did. I think it went down to $200 after that but hey you win some you lose some.

What if shadow governments take over the exchanges and force the developers to fork the code to get rid of the max? Didn't think of that did you?

Bernie says hes gonna pay everybodys student loans off. Doubt he's gonna give us all bitcoin so the the choice should be clear.
@_date: 2019-09-14 09:04:25
Aye man, that's kinda the point. The keys are that important. Think about it, if you could recover the keys then anybody could recover and spend anybodies bitcoin and you would have surely heard about this flaw by now. Now that's not to say some future bitcoin jesus can't come and type out satoshis private key first try while tripping on DMT. It's just letters and numbers and if you get them all right you have the key. However, If you tried to direct all of humanities computing power at guessing satoshis private key it would probably take trillions of years to get through all the combinations.

Well I sure as shit didn't buy it to sell it at a lower price, so maybe there is some truth there.

So how terrible of an idea would it be for non-Venezuelans who cant afford houses elsewhere but could afford the 50k usd to buy a nice house in Caracas to live debt free? I assume there is a massive catch even besides the obvious increased incidents of crime and rampant corruption.
@_date: 2019-09-18 21:31:51
People's first instinct seems to be along the lines of "if I don't buy in I can't lose anything and it will probably just go away because everybody thinks like me". Governments are ultimately run by people.
