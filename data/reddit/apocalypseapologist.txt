Isn't one solar powered Chinese death laser enough?

You're right in some ways, but I'm making closer to 20k a year, making near minimum wage in a high rent area. Half my pay goes into rent, with a quarter going into paying off old debts, and not enough left over to pay for a car, so I'm taking transit.  
If I had 50k, I could pay off my debts and put a down payment on a decent car. I don't know about life changing, since I live in a city with decent transit, but it would be really, really nice.

American here, if I had 1 bitcoin worth of liquid income, I could pay off my credit card debt and make a down payment on a good car.  
If I had 5 bitcoins worth of liquid income, I could pay off my credit card, student loans, and outright buy a good used car.  
Good for me means reliable and fuel efficient.  
Edited because my comment felt too snarky.

The problem in America is the system is designed to be played.  
Designed to be played if you're super rich anyway. Poor boys like me are stuck paying more than our share.

Bitcoin is at the top. It's a little under 4k USD to 1 BTC right now, not 5 million. :D

Jesus, your comment makes me irrationally angry.  
You're being sarcastic, right?

Thank you OP! Too many people see bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme.  
It's a frickin currency, you guys! It can be exchanged for goods and services. ^(but mostly drugs.)

'Dozens' is an understatement, this spam was reported a couple hours ago in r/sysadmin  
Here's the text in case anyone is interested:  


















If anyone got this spam and has the original address, I'd be seriously interested to know if anyone's paid.

Glad to hear nobody's that stupid.
