Ethereum aims to offer a Turing complete scripting language where the results are validated in a distributed fashion. There are many things you could do with Ethereum. 
Counterparty aims to be a distributed exchange with user defined assets, price feeds, betting, CDFs and dividends. 
Counterparty is live right now, whereas Ethereum will be pre-IPO for another few weeks, I think. Also, Counterparty is native to the Bitcoin blockchain, whereas Ethereum will have it's own separate blockchain (or tree?). 
I have no doubt that a DEX could easily be built in Etherium, but Counterparty might have some first mover advantages. 
Fair disclosure: I'm invested in Counterparty, and I'll also be investing in Ethereum.

That's one way of looking at it. Another would be to say that value was transferred from those who participated in the burn period to existing holders of Bitcoin. I take the point about OT (big fan) but I feel there was a certain fairness and trustlessness to the distribution of Counterparty that made it stand out a little from Ripple, and Ethereum.

Nice little price spike @ Havelock, perhaps on this news.

You've already got some helpful answers here, but you could also check out the intro video on [We Use Coins]( If you get into Bitcoin more, I think you'll also like the podcast [Let's Talk Bitcoin!](

This is really nice - great work!

They're probably staggering their bids.

"Trade engine cooldown (lag too high), order placing suspended until 2013-04-13 21:30:00 UTC" It seems that after they unsuspended @ 21:00, the lag crept up by about 60  seconds per minute. Maybe offering free trading to compensate for the last debacle wasn't such a great idea. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 13:03:38
I guess this didn't get any momentum? I still think it's a great idea and would be up for investing if anyone picks it up again.

Check out a project called Open Transactions, which seems to be heading in this kind of direction, but with no need for a blockchain - 
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:31:08
Great work!

Yeah, it's cool stuff. There are a few exchanges that will do it, but I'm using [vircurex.com]( Look for the XPM/BTC pair. The current rate is about 250 Primecoins for a Bitcoin.

There's a log trend on this chart that has held since April 2011 which should offer some pretty solid resistance @ around $30, and there's every chance we could bounce before $50.

If you're new, and you just want to experiment a bit, you could consider mining an altcoin. I've been playing around with mining for the first time over the past week, and mined enough Primecoin to be worth about a couple of BTC. It was good fun and it got me under the hood, playing with compiling the source, and such.
@_date: 2013-06-29 05:35:52
I think maybe it's your two cents that's gone :o)

Back up a few minutes ago.
@_date: 2013-06-29 16:55:16
Very interesting - thanks for this. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:01:18
Seems to be available on igindex.co.uk too. I think these might be binary bets rather than options.
@_date: 2013-06-18 17:24:05
Actually - this wall is being eaten, so perhaps it was a serious bid after all. Let's see how long it lasts. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 11:01:27
One of the speakers, Wai Tsang, is an old buddy of mine. He has some very interesting theories on the fractal, computable, nature of the universe. I know he's presenting some new stuff at the Expo (not Bitcoin related, but mind-expanding, nonetheless) but here's some of his older stuff on [YouTube](  
@_date: 2013-06-15 14:33:57
Sounds exciting. If it gets off the ground I'd potentially be in for 20 shares.
@_date: 2013-06-29 16:22:51
Yeah - spread is widening. Better move my bids. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:24:42
Looks like a potential pump and dump to me. There's a conspicuous $0.5m bid wall supporting the price @ $108.5 that looks a bit suspicious. I think we might see that disappear soon.

Last week I asked a room of twenty five UK entrepreneurs if they'd come across Bitcoin. I was expecting zero hands but actually got one - it turn out he was a Linux admin. This stat doesn't tally with my personal experience, at least.
@_date: 2013-06-18 17:26:55
... and it's gone.

Bitinstant.com have created a service that quickly changes your fiat into MtGox IOUs that people find quite useful. I look forward to being able to instantly get MtGox USD or MtGox BTC without the hassle of a SEPA transfer.  
@_date: 2013-04-07 09:00:14
It does indeed seem that they can't keep up. I submitted yesterday and my position was 13820, so the queue seems to be growing.
@_date: 2013-07-17 08:08:13
Looks like a really useful service - great stuff. Pity we need to hand over our a/c number and password to access Bitstamp. Are you pushing them to offer key based API access with granular permissions? 
@_date: 2013-06-29 16:10:45
Interesting ...and happy cake day!
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:39:47
Up over here, just very slow. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 16:20:47
I'm from the UK, but isn't Delaware basically a kind of tax haven state with minimal reporting requirements and zero tax? Maybe they just needed a US presence in order to file with FinCEN.
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:01:33
I take it you run Havelock? I signed up for an account just yesterday - nice service :o) 
@_date: 2013-07-13 23:37:49
I'd like to second this request for a chart only version, or a version where  you don't need to login to view data. Looks great though.
@_date: 2013-01-10 13:16:05
Congrats! You could try [SatoshiDice](

You need a certain amount of XRP to use the system. About a couple of dollars worth at present prices should be enough for most people.

Sure. the [Alternate cryptocurrencies]( section of [bitcointalk.org]( is a great place to start. 
It was cool participating in mining a new altcoin from the moment it was released. I think the key is to pick a cryptocurrency that has some interesting and novel properties, rather than just being a copy of an existing crypto but with some parameters changed. 
[Primecoin]( is from the same team that developed PPCoin, and is novel because it uses a few different classes of [prime number chain]( as proof of work - so it produces something scientifically useful as a by-product of its operation. If you were to start mining now, I think you'd probably be early enough to get a block every couple of days on a fast PC (something with 8 cores, say). 
It was fun to see primitive exchanges for the new currency spring up on the boards almost immediately, and to watch the community rush to optimise the client to find primes more efficiently. Folks would create new builds and post the binaries to Dropbox - I didn't fancy running these so had a bit of a crack at the source myself. I didn't find any really good optimisations but it was fun to get under the hood anyway :o)
