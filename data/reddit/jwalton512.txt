Thanks. Any specific reasons you would go this direction?

I recall reading (somewhere, but not sure where) that this one was a bit less secure due to the fact it didn't have a screen.  
I don't recall the reasoning exactly, but I thought it had to do with the fact that if your computer was hacked, hackers could potentially see what you're doing, since you have to enter it on screen.  Not sure how accurate that is.  I believe rebuttal was that there was a secure card that also had to be used.

Thanks for the advice.  I have been trying to research the paper wallets a bit.  I get a bit confused with the issue with change addresses, then my brain starts to hurt.
Hardware wallets like the Trezor are definitely presented as if they make the whole cold storage thing much simpler.

I think that contributes to my paranoia to be honest.  I have never been one to carry around cash.  Cash terrifies me.  If I can't use a debit/credit card, then I don't buy it lol.

Thanks for the link.
I'm currently using Electrum but on a computer that is connected to the network (I'm sure by saying that, I'm going to be hacked :paranoid:)
One of the things I explored was buying a cheap pc and never letting it touch the network and doing my cold storage there.  Seems like a lot of effort though.

Ooh, that price is definitely tempting.
I was almost comfy with the $119 price already.

Thanks for the info.  
If using printer/paper wallet, do I still need to have a dedicated offline pc for generating wallet, etc.  Thought I read that before. 
It seems like going the paper direction has a lot more inherent costs and effort.  True/false?

that seems pretty good and simple to use.

i don't quite understand this, but it seems cool :)  bitcoin is a scary place.
