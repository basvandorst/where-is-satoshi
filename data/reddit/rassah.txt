There's no centralized server to send the coins to. The only thing a server does is allow people to announce their intent to mix. All mixing is done in a decentralized manner with your coins only leaving your wallet after you know the mixing transaction will send them back.
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:38:41
Not really. Different department :/
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:29:58
There's no risk of coin loss in this case. It's a single transaction that sends your coins to your own different address, and you don't sign that transaction until you verify that you will get those coins back. Everyone else tacks on their own transactions, only signing them after they verified them, and the full transaction isn't valid until everyone verifies and signs. After everyone does, it's just broadcast to the blockchain, and everyone gets freshly mixed coins into their own wallets. The only risk is that someone may not sign their own part of the transaction, at which point the transaction simply won't happen.

This will be rolled out on top of the old code, and changed old BitcoinJ code, among other things. Yes, we are very security oriented. It's why we had to abandon the old idea.
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:12:08
This bullshit again? I tore down all these claims before in another thread. But let's go over it again one by one:
1) You didn't invest in the current or future wallet, you invested in the Mycelium Wallet overall. Mycelium does actually have a wallet people use. The investment will be used to make this current wallet profitable. Yes, it was split out into a separate company, but that was so you could directly invest in it without risking your money on other undeveloped and risky projects. You are still free to invest in our other products directly. There is no "core product" within Mycelium.
2) That's completely incorrect. Mycelium Wallet has made money. Ask Trezor, Cashila, and Glidera to confirm. In fact you yourself contradicted your first sentence with your third one. Yes, it hasn't made much, but it was never intended to make anything at all until now. It was a free app for the sole purpose of developing our brand and reputation. Now we are developing the new app specifically with the goal of having it make money. None of the invested money is "cashed in." It's all staying with the company for the purpose of developing the new wallet. 
I don't know where you get this idea that we "have no idea how to monetize the software." There is no evidence for that at all. **The idea for how to monetize the software was the actual idea the crowdsale was sold on**. I've told you what it was numerous times: an app platform.
3) I doubt you'll get a lot sympathy from our users, or bitcoiners in general, about us "eschewing" anything related to government.
4) Mycelium has money. Much more than what we raised. After 4 years of development we just didn't want to continue to spend our own money, and with a prospect of an app that can actually earn something, wanted to share that potential with our biggest supporters. But it's there if it's needed to keep the company going. We don't intend to go to court though, since we haven't done anything illegal or stole anything from anyone who invested.
5) The only fund mixing that should happen is for shared resources. Same servers that run Mycelium Wallet backend also provide balance information for Mycelium Gear (though we're in the process of switching to BitcoinJ SPV). We also have one accountant, one legal team, and one product manager to handle all the different products. Mycelium Wallet isn't a completely separate company, it's a subsidiary, so shared resources at the top are to be expected as with all subsidiaries.
6) The new and the old wallet are one and the same. The new one is just being built on top of the old one.

We'll consider those when there's something to consider. Tons of other priorities for now.
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:53:30
1) Look in the documents. Right here in the sales agreement  What do the first two paragraphs say? In case you have trouble with legalese, you are entering into a contract between you and Mycelium Holding, the parent company, to buy a stake in Mycelium Wallet which is owned by Mycelium SIA, the subsidiary. Look at the definition of tokens. Mycelium Wallet Tokens are contracts granting SARs from Mycelium SIA, the subsidiary that owns the wallet. Read the text of  that explains everything in plain english. Where do you see that the investment is only in the new wallet, instead of "the Mycelium Wallet Project" as is stated over and over? If people didn't think they bought a subsidiary, then they didn't read the contract they signed, and didn't see all the explanations around Reddit, our Telegram group, and various interviews in news articles we've had talking about this crowdsale.
2) Do you have a bitcoin company that pays a half dozen full time dev salaries? You even admitted that you don't know how to monetize a wallet, simple because others have failed to do so. We know what we're doing. You just have no idea what we're doing.
3) No, the founder's finances didn't come from bitcoin going up. Again, it came from numerous other businesses he owned, started, and sold. Nor was ANY of this out of his generosity. Everything he invested in he hoped to make some sort of return from, including this wallet, which was initially just a freebie to build up company reputation while other things panned out. Funny that you think the very thing the company reputation is built on would be the scam, bringing in just 2 mil, when he has invested eight figures already. Even real scammers aren't that dumb.
5-6) Whoever told you whatever you think you were told, either didn't know what they were talking about, because it wasn't us, or you didn't understand it, possibly because you already had your own preconceived conclusions.
If you have anything of actual substance to bring up, go ahead. Just opinions and accusations aren't worth much.

Mycelium Wallet is our flagship product for our business, so we're not dropping the wallet. As for the tumbler, only reason we wouldn't add it is due to lack of resources, but as the article says, it follows the standard CoinShuffle spec, so it's free for anyone to add.

@_date: 2016-08-24 21:06:48
What do you mean? We are trying. Bitsquare supports them now and we're trying to get others to too. Problem is that exchanges are worried that these are actual legal shares of a company instead of inherently worthless tokens (like from most other crowdsales) and are concerned it would put them in a different regulatory environment.

@_date: 2016-08-12 21:28:02
Bitcoin plus...
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:15:52
1) We sold a subsidiary, not an app. The subsidiary owns the current and the future wallet. When you bought a stake in a subsidiary, you bought "the wallet." No one ever claimed we were selling the overall company.
2) Only the wallet made less than $100,000 in 4 years. A wallet that was intended to be completely free and not make anything. I don't know what the overall company made. Now that we have an idea how to monetize it, by focusing on those things that have earned us money, we hope to turn this into a profit making machine. Don't question our business experience. You will thoroughly lose that argument.
4) Yes we do. How do you suppose Mycelium has existed for 6+ years, developing numerous bitcoin software and hardware projects, and paying dozens of employees and hardware and software developers salaries? We are under no obligation to disclose the overall company finances (feel free to email and ask our CEO directly), but Mycelium has spent around 8 figures developing for the bitcoin economy, mostly from our company owner's private funds. He owns a few other profitable companies besides just Mycelium, and has started and sold a number of successful businesses in the past. As I said, we wanted to do a crowdsale because we don't want to spend entirely our money, and because now that we have a good idea for how to monetize this, we wanted to share those potential rewards with our supporters.
5) Same wallet, same name, same business customers, same users, same company, same funds. Don't know what you're talking about. Check the legal docs, says clearly Mycelium Wallet was moved into a subsidiary, and crowdsale was in that subsidiary.
6) Again, you're wrong there.
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:47:53
Hey, what would you like to speak about?
@_date: 2016-08-25 02:45:51
That's just a security update they did while changing out the backend. I think... It should at most just ask you for a new password. For a lot of people it asked them to set up a new password, then you log in with the news one, and decrypt your keys with the old one. Let me know if you have trouble getting to your tokens and we'll see if we can help.
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:18:47
As long as you have those tokens, you still have a legally backed claim to a percent of the company and whatever changes in valuation it has. If you have trouble accessing your tokens, please let us know. Sorry that we ended up picking Colu right in the middle of their major upgrade/overhaul. Their system works though.
If your question is about what you can do with the tokens themselves, you can trade them OTC through our Mycelium telegram group, trade them through Bitsquare, or hold them as a long term investment in our company. If the company goes up in value or starts making a profit, as long as you hold those tokens you'll get something back.
@_date: 2016-08-12 05:41:28
Then you for giving a mention and some more credibility. We wouldn't know about it without the help of people like you.

@_date: 2016-08-23 15:40:06
Things are holding steady, and development is progressing. We're currently moving to BitcoinJ with Dash's help, and implementing SPV support for wallets. Another dev is working on the UI updates, and another on Colu colored coin support. Plus we're finishing up CoinShuffle as a standalone app that will eventually be implemented in the wallet itself. So, progress.
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:21:35


When you log in and before you attempt to buy, you have to read the documents. What's more, you actually have to sign them and we have to verify them before you can even get anything.


Mycelium owns 95% of the company. Why would it want to buy another 5% more? You are thinking of this as if it was an altcoin like ETH or something. It's not. It's an actual percentage of the company. Mycelium can just sell more shares out of that remaining 95% later. And why would we inflate the valuation of our company to reduce the potential future payout? Think about it: we don't get anything extra from this now, if the valuation is too high then the next crowdsale won't get us much either as investors will stay away thinking its too high, and what's worse, if we don't even get to the current valuation level next time, we'll be screwing our current 1000+ investors by making them lose money (that's when the lawsuits come out). We would literally be screwing ourselves for absolutely no gain whatsoever. Having too high of a valuation was the thing we feared MOST during this crowdsale. Why would we want to make it worse?
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:37:44


For the first 5% yes. The next 20% will be dilutable.

Same business plan used by app stores, built into the wallet. Future revenues from licensing and revenue sharing. We have such agreement with current offerings already (Locks, Cashila, Glidera), and will increase that in the new wallet.


Says right in the dicuments, development costs and advertising. Mostly will be used for developer salaries.


As much as we can get, to pay salaries and help expand this business. We are funded enough to see this project through completion, but not enough to keep it going after.


Read the documents provided. You will have a signed purchase agreement. Frankly, all of this is answered in the documents, and we are collecting to put up more company disclosure stuff at the time of the sale.


What conflicts of interest?

@_date: 2016-08-23 15:45:46
"Everything" wasn't hidden. People were asking a whole lot of questions specifically about the terms, and all those were being addressed and explained before and during the crowdsale. Also all the parts of it were explained in plain english for inexperienced people to understand. Not only was there a link to the page, there was a link to all the terms too. It's even still up on our wallet.mycelium.com page in the Crowdsale dropdown at the top here 
And no one was in the dark about what their actual share was worth. 5% of the company was sold, what you bought was your portion of that 5% based on the final valuation, and any future returns on your share would be based on the overall company growth, not what % you owned (i.e. if company doubled in value, your holdings doubled in value, regardless of how much you own).
So, was there anything SPECIFIC in the "terms of this crowdsale" that was hidden " in the details of the contract" that made this a "scam"? Or did you not read the terms either? Because having a contract that someone can't understand doesn't make something a scam (look at every legal and investment contract out there). It just means that that person shouldn't buy what they don't understand.

If our project successfully transitions from a bitcoin wallet to a digital asset management platform that supports currencies and business services through plugins, and makes money through licensing and revenue sharing charged to businesses that offer apps through our project, basically becoming an app store for all things crypto, we could earn quite a lot. It's the same "connect businesses to users through one unified service" business that Appstore, Google Play, and even Amazon, eBay, and Airbnb use.

Already answered this guy directly via email. The seed still works. At the very worst it could just be a configuration issue (our old iOS wallet used a slightly different HD derivation than our Android wallet, which we have since changed). No money should be lost. Just headaches. Sorry.
@_date: 2016-04-27 06:39:59


Use the new wallet without installing any extra plugins and apps. Light version is the default. Things like extended transaction categories, support for multisig and BIP70 based invoicing, and encrypted peer to peer chat will be standard though, but you don't have to use them.
It won't make it more complex, but it will result in fewer security risks on the backend. Right now the code is all lumped together and is difficult to check.  An feature introduced in one part could cause security issues elsewhere. Breaking up into modules that talk to each other will make auditing each module easier, and if a security risk is found, another module could be swapped in (for instance, if Bitcore is found to have problems, you could install BitcoinJS or Libbitcoin).
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:52:41
These are not shares, they are rights to cash from increased valuation. Yes, these 5% always retain their proportional value of the total company valuation. If you buy 1% of the stake, you will always own 1% of the company,min you don't pull out the cash you have a right to.
The examples I wrote to try to explain this:
If we sell 2,000 BTC in this first round, that means we sell 2,000 tokens, for a total valuation of 2,000/%5 = 40,000 bitcoin and 40,000 tokens. If next round we sell 20% and raise 12,000 BTC, which would make the new company value 12,000/20%=60,000, that means the company value grew by 1.5, and everyone who bought the 5% at 1 BTC will get the right to receive an extra 0.5 BTC. So of the 12,000 BTC we raise, 1,000 BTC will be offered to be redistributed to the original investors. The token itself will always be valued (by us, not the market) at the amount you initially paid for (in USD at the May 18th exchange rate). But the token will grant you the right to increases in company valuation on top of it. So in the example here, your total value is 1.5 BTC, with 1 BTC being the token itself and 0.5 being either cash sitting in our company that we owe you (it belongs to you, just like owning a stock share means a part of company assets belongs to you), or as cash you can pull out and hold yourself.
Think of it this way. When you buy an actual real share of stock, that makes you an actual literal owner of a part of the company. You actually own the right to a part of the equipment, cash, etc. The company can offer to buy back your share by giving you a portion of company cash, which you own, in exchange for that share. It works the same way here, where the token grants you ownership of a part of the company, including equipment and cash, but instead of us offering to buy back the stock share in exchange for the cash you already own, you can just ask for that cash yourself.
Hope this helps

We don't have a formal written business plan. Would take a while to sit down and write, and those generally aren't really done any more. We just have a description of the wallet features we are currently working on, and idea for how we plan to make money (app platform). Everything else would be quite difficult to predict.


Salaries for the current 4 devs and 2 interns, which currently total less than €50k a month, and for the Product Manager, who earns less than the devs (labor of love for me). We plan to hire a UI developer, and two more devs, one for Android and one for iOS. Infrastructure costs are less than $200 a month, and cover all our servers, some development tools, and minor office expenses. Advertising costs we're not sure on, since we've never had those. We typically focus on word of mouth, or print materials ourselves using our own resources. We intend to keep focusing on word of mouth, but will possibly attend more conferences and maybe buy some online ads. We are not very fond of sponsorships, since they cost a ton, and have a very low return (plus everywhere we go, most people know about us already). Another advertising will be on going after crypto businesses to ask them to implement their service in our wallet.


We just simply don't know how much we will need. We have funding to get this project to the end, but just barely. We want extra funding to speed up development (hire the extra devs), and to keep us funded as we build the wallet up with more apps and API support after it's done. The basic wallet is just the first step, developing the business after it's done will be a lot of work too. While we can probably do it while scraping by on almost nothing, we would rather not (we have had that experience before, and developers are typically not happy about not being paid, even if they really believe in the project)


You will have basically a contract with us, where your token would give you the right to a claim on any increase in company valuation. You are able to either call that right, receiving the extra amount inncash, or keep it in the company, where it will be effectively a liability for us on your claim. If we refuse payment of your ownership right, you will have a document that allows you to seek legal retribution. I'm not sure what other details you may be looking for. Most questions so far have been about confusion on how SARs work.


I'm sorry, we are working on that, and hopefully most of that will be available online by the time this sale starts. From what I understand now, the company is privately owned by our CEO, the other projects are completely compartmentalized, having their own managers and employees, their own budgets, and their own funding sources. Expenses are monitored by our own accountants, and will be published quarterly to shareholders.


We have full legal councel. I'm just trying to describe it as best as I can. If I have failed, I'm sorry, I'm not a lawyer. We suggest you consult with your own legal councel if you have complex questions. As I said, the information you, or he, will need will be made available.


We have not taken any money. The crowdsale starts on May 1st. We will have the documents up before then.


Please do not conflict my personal statements on here as being representative of the whole company. Software development and legal are not my main strengths. Business and finance are. We have other capable business managers here with experience of starting and managing multi-billion companies, and we have professional legal councel handling the crowdsale. I'm just trying to relay as much information as I can, which is admittedly new to me too, in my position as a Community Manager (I have two jobs here). I am, unfortunately, quite aware of the prevalence of developers with no business or finance experience trying to do business and finance in this field (I have had the unfortunate experience of trying to clean up after that mess). I assure you this company is not like that. Feel free to look online at the background of the team involved.

I mentioned how much we are paying in salaries now. Under €50k a month. I'm not saying how much for extra salaries not because I'm trying to be shady, but because we are hiring just three people, and I don't want to just give out much we will pay. Not to you, to people we will be hiring. That's the only reason. So use just whatever you believe an average Android and iOS dev salary will be. As for expanding the business? Honestly we just don't know. Seriously,  the only answer I can give is "hopefully much less than we will raise." We won't blow it on stupid or irresponsible shit, like sponsoring a football game (even if it did help bring bitcoin a bit more into the mainstream). But we are at a very very early stage in our company, so we simply don't know.

These expose you to company growth, not income. If company grows by 1.5 times, your SAR entitles you to 0.5 extra payout. If we reach a stage of actual income above expenses (profits), that would trigger an even leading to changing these tokens to something that may actually pay dividends.
@_date: 2016-04-28 01:29:22
We are most definitely not a charity, and are pursuing a very well established business model.

You can also claim the SAR payment in bitcoin, sell your token to someone else,  and while not being able to get the stock, at least be able to cash out all the valuation increase.

You get the rights to value increase from the IPO. If we sell 2,000 BTC, that means we sell 2,000 tokens, for a total valuation of 2,000/%5 = 40,000 bitcoin and 40,000 tokens. If next round we sell 20% and raise 12,000 BTC, which would make the new company value 12,000/20%=60,000, that means the company value grew by 1.5, and everyone who bought the 5% at 1 BTC will get the right to receive an extra 0.5 BTC. So of the 12,000 BTC we raise, 1,000 BTC will be offered to be redistributed to the original investors. If we sell through IPO, you get the same option to get cash from that increase as well, or convert your SAR and cash into a share of stock for the same share amount of the company. But any increases in shares of value will no longer be reflected, correct.

We repurchase the token at the nominal value. You still get profit from all the SAR you'll get paid out in cash if the company value goes up during that repurchase time.

How does that happen? I don't whitelist addresses when I buy stuff through Gyft, I just send to whatever address I'm given that I believe is correct.


That's exactly how that would work. But it would be cumbersome extra steps for the app to let you send money, and then for the bitcoin app to pop up with another thing asking you to confirm. It will basically have to be a balance between usability (by fairly stupid users who may not even know what bitcoin is) and security trying to hold their hand.
@_date: 2016-04-28 01:24:45
That's true. Besides Google Play Store and Apple Appstore there are also FDroid, Amazon Marketplace, and dozens of Chinese app stores.

1) Will be provided in documents provided during the crowdsale.
2) Answered here  In short we are going to be a platform that allows businesses to sell services and applications to users, like an Appstore within a wallet. Financials will be published quarterly, listing all our expenses.
3) Again, will be published during the crowdsale. For current revenues, only a few thousand. Basically insignificant, because we have not been focusing on this revenue source, and haven't even realized that it was a potential before. Initially, the wallet was just a free "gift" to the community for the same of establishing the Mycelium brand. In short, you are not investing in a company with established cashflow, you are investing in a startup with an established reputation and customer base, and established business relationships (we already have third party services),  which is going to develop an already established and proven business model. 
4) a. Repurchase **of the token** at nominal value is because any increase in valuation will have already been paid out directly in cash. b. Trigger events are clearly described in the agreement. c. Tokens are colored coins. They are traded directly just like bitcoins. Our responsibility ends once we receive the bitcoins and send the colored coin tokens into your own wallet. The rights to claim on SAR and other stuff is backed by the legal purchase agreement signed between us and the buyer at the time of purchase.
Admittedly, what we are doing is very new and different. However, we are not selling speculative coins, like Etherium, Mastercoin, Factom, or others. We are actually selling real ownership in the company, albeit in a roundabout way used during pregnancy IPO stage.

I think back in August or July of 2015 there was a general Android bug discovered where the random numbers generated by Android weren't random enough. With that, any transaction published to the network could potentially have its key cracked. We patched our wallet to use a better random number system, but I don't think it affected any of our users. Since our app uses HD wallets that send change to a new address every time, old addresses getting cracked wasn't as big of a concern either. I may be wrong on my time, and maybe that happened two year ago instead of one, but that's the only other thing I can think of besides bitaddress.org being run on a compromised computer, or possibly being created using a compromised key generator in the first place (such as some other bad random generator). As someone else mentioned, if it was a brainwallet, that may have been cracked too. Sorry for your loss, glad it wasn't a huge amount of money.

No need. You don't pay to use Google Play or Amazon (besides prime for free shipping)
@_date: 2016-04-29 23:59:24
1) IANAL, so I don't know the legal status. You'll have to check the documents on the site. I believe they are actual SARs, but if not, that's how we plan to operate them.
2) No. The purchases are nonrefundable, so there's no need to. Funds will be stored in a secure account though (either multisig right away, or on secure hardware). We don't intend to lose these funds. Luckily we have experience with securing bitcoin.
3) Nothing is reserved. The entire 5% is for sale, but development team gets a bigger discount. I am ineligible due to insider trading issues.
4) Yes, a SAR does not grant dividends. This will work like any other SAR. In case of a trigger event, holders get the right to btc in the amount of company value increase. They just need to prove they own the token.

With this wallet. It's built specifically with SPV in mind.
EDIT: Actually, the answer is a bit  ore involved that that. Bitcoin will just be a plugin you install. We are currently using Bitcore, but if someone writes a plugin for bitcoin that uses any of the other libraries, you'd use that. Or libraries that use other coins. So, it's all up to you.

You may be right on  with regards to bitcoin's possibility for growth, but Mycelium will no longer be tied to bitcoin. We will support many different assets and blockchains. And we hope the money we raise will be used to make bitcoin even more usable, accessible, and thus more valuable. So even if your investment in us doesn't provide as high a return as bitcoin itself, we hope it will help make the rest of your bitcoins rise even more.

Stop updating the old app. And eventually disable its servers, so it won't be able to send any more.
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:37:54
It will be, somewhat. The new app will support SPV. The backend will just run whatever third parties will need to run their plugins, and anything that can't be done in SPV, like colored coins. It will be just whatever code we are given or find online, and will be up to the providers whether it will be open or not.
Main point is that everything the wallet needs to run will be open source.

Just the wallet division of our company. It will still be a part of Mycelium.
Wallet is the only product we have that is fully functional and marketable. Other projects are still under early development, and are difficult to value. So you are just buying the product division we know works, not taking risk from other products that may or may not succeed, and due to their early stages are nearly impossible to evaluate.

It shows the items as "purchased," and then cancelled on Purse. Happened to me too. I have a specific Purse list, separate from my main one, and nobody buys me gifts :(

Lightning is supposedly just a way to handle scripted transactions (like multisig and such), so it would just be a software change.
@_date: 2016-04-27 00:35:25
Yes. The plugins will have to go through our servers. That's how we will make money from an open source wallet: you're free to build your own and run your own plugin, but if you want your plugin to be with the largest repository available, you'll have to go through us. I do expect that we will fail miserably at some time early on though, and will learn our lesson from that experience, as is typical for all startups. So, be careful.
@_date: 2016-04-28 01:22:39
No. Not until the backend servers are deactivated way after the new wallet is released.
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:00:46
Figuring out how much potential income we will have is pretty difficult. I can't even begin to guess. The wallet will be entirely open source. We will have servers hosting plugins, as a sort of an app store. Users can download plugins and either pay for them directly (such as the current Ledger TEE), or pay a percent when using the service (such as current Locks and Cashila which charge a small fee per transaction). We will charge these businesses a percent of the money they charge for sales and services. Having an exchange that allows people to day trade right from within our wallet, with the exchange differentiating itself on higher volume, better service, and better designed plugins with more features, could provide massive revenues even if we charge a tiny fraction of a percent, just on volume alone. Future revenue will depend on how many services sign up with us, and how well those businesses perform, as well as other Mycelium products we will be selling through out wallet directly. While the wallet is open source, access to our market will be restricted. So, for instance, an exchange is free to make their own version of the wallet, but it won't be able to get access to all the other plugins on the marker. We will basically be like an Appstore, building on network effects.
Hope that helps.

* Attachments, such as images for items or receipts, or contract documents
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:38:58
We are selling SAR, not IPOs. We don't know how much we will sell in total. Valuation triggers happen if we sell more shares, or if we go through an IPO process selling actual stock, or if the project becomes profitable, in which case we would convert to dividend paying assets. Each sale of shares will allow users to earn from increased valuation or performance of the company.

@_date: 2016-04-27 01:56:09
SARs grant you rights to a percent of the company, and all increases in company value. These increases are paid out directly. So if you buy your share for $500, and the company value doubles, you will get $500 in cash on top of the token you already own. So any investment upsides are actually already paid out as cash before this even happens. It's basically like owning an unchanging in value share that grants you dividends from any growth in company value.

They will be in a sandbox, of course. Technically each plugin will run in its own protected sace, only able to communicate with other parts of the wallet using signed encrypted channels (wouldn't want third parties listening in on what's going on either). I'm just saying no one is perfect, and no software is perfectly secure. Worse yet, someone could create a malicious plugin that asks the users to pay for something, but sends that money to their own account by changing the address.
@_date: 2016-04-29 00:09:18


2000 BTC is 900,000, not 9 mil. And sounds closed to reality.
We are selling however many tokens people will buy. The number sold will determine our valuation, though we may cap it at some number if it starts to get ridiculout. We don't want to screw our supporters out of future potential. And yes, the numbers given are just an example, not actual numbers.

Savings and Lending are one and the same, where your savings give you a small return (unlike in a paper Waller) because they are pooled together with others and lent out for large projects. BTCJam can only handle tiny loans (not houses or huge business or infrastructure expenditures), and requires you to do much of the research work yourself (and it kinda sucks). Having a bank vet the borrowers invest professionally, and go after defaulters, all on your behalf, would still be a very valuable service.
The reason you can't get 2FA on your bank login is because the rest of their security is so good that they don't feel you need it, or that the extra hassle for you will even be worth it. Most people don't know anything about computer security, and would rather leave their bitcoin security to someone else, even if through multisig. Look how popular Coinbase is.

Ah, yes, or clurse. That's already in the plan. My thought was you get a plugin that let's you buy coffee at a discount for watching an ad, grant it the right to get your bitcoin history and create transactions, and it shows that you are sending $5 to starbucks, while you are sending a $5,000 "mining fee" to the thief's account.

So, how did millions of new investors and a billion of USD worth get into bitcoin without filling up transactions? It seemed like everyone and their mother was trying to buy in.
Regarding fee increase in USD terms, BTC is still worth $9k, and fees are 1 to 2 Satoshi, or a few pennies. I don't think the issue was fees growing in USD terms, otherwise they would still be $10 now.
Agreed on exchanges buckling under pressure, but high fees had a lot to do with that pressure too.

That's exactly how it works. The QR code displayed includes a random challenge string associated with that specific login attempt on that browser, and a URL to send the signed verification back to. Your phone signs the challenge string, includes the address it was signed with, and sends it back to the URL. The server receives it, not caring where it received it from, checks if the address is already in its database (if not, it crates a new account), and allows the page with the signed challenge string to sign in. So you could be on a malware infected library computer, and still safely log in with your phone's bitcoin wallet.
BTW, Mycelium already supports this with fully functional code, but the code is not enabled anywhere but testnet at this point. Mainly because the standards are STILL not completely settled on.
EDIT: I suppose multisig could work, but there's no real reason for it that I could think of. Especially with greatly improved single address hardware-based security coming in a few months.
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:53:04


Exactly. This is exactly how I understood it, and why it bugged me when people said "We don't need a block size increase, because SegWit increased block size and solves that problem." It was lied about, being presented as a short term solution.


Only after transaction fees hit $30 and killed growth, popping the bubble and causing people to stop investing or move elsewhere. How much more would BTC be worth right now if we didn't have high fees put the brakes on growth in December?

Government workers already get salaries in that form as direct deposit from government computers to bank computers. And government already controls the amount of coins (USD) available for trade. Well, somewhat. Federal reserve does. So I guess that would be one difference, but it would make the amount of money in circulation up to the whim of elected politicians (if you want to know how that turns out, look at Weimar Republic). So the system you are describing is one we have.
The features of bitcoin that are driving its adoption, which government would NOT include, are:
* supply not under control of any government or entity
* no country limits on where it can be spent, or border restrictions over which it can be sent. It's truly global, like the internet
* no restrictions on how it can be spent, on what, or with what level of privacy
* no restrictions on who can innovate on top of it, or use it for whatever they want (see Mastercoin and others)
This is also why VoIP and internet killed off landline telephone monopolies, which also had the same issues that internet got rid of (control over who can use it, long distance and international restrictions and pricing, control over who can develop on the telephone networks, and what can innovators do with it, which was pretty much limited to cordless phones and answering machines)

I think you just heard a bunch of random words, have no idea what they mean in regards to how bitcoin actually works, and due to having a starting bias that bitcoin is somehow wrong, ended up trying to fit those random words into your idea of bitcoin to convince yourself that it somehow doesn't work. Much in the same way evolution deniers pick out concepts they barely understand, and try to fit them into their preconceived notions that evolution is a lie. 51% attack is not a problem, neither is a block discarding, and there's no such thing as "difficulty raising" other than by valid market competition.

Pool operators have to run full nodes, as do exchanges, merchant processors, bitcoin "banks", some bitcoin businesses, and likely bitcoin millionaires, so that they can verify their own chain and be completely secure with their coins.

Besides getting 3% to 6% discount on almost everything I buy, it's also easiER to use, more convenient, let's me manage my money the way other things don't, gives me more privacy and security, and gives me buying options that other things don't, such as being able to shop for services anywhere in the world, instead on only in my own country that my credit card let's me (or doesn't charge massive foreign transaction fees).

Specifically, "WTF do I do with all this money?!"
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:55:08


Buying shit **using someone else's money* is not contributing (just like voting for someone to take your money and give it to someone else is not charity). Especially since the original owner of that money would have bought shit, anyway, and wouldn't have had to pay the administrative fees needed to move that money our of his pocket into someone else's.


Many of those things won't, because it costs so much to hire and pay someone. If I find a neighborhood of very busy people who need their grass cut, and want to hire a bunch of guys so I can drive them there, and we all can use my lawnmowers to take care of their problem for about $100 for each of us (not bad for a day's work), I STILL can't do that, because to hire them I have to get their SS numbers, pay for their worker's comp insurance, pay all employment taxes, pay taxes on what I pay them, file fees needed to report and pay those taxes, and make sure that I pay them some minimum amount regardless of how much grass they actually cut. It's too costly, and too risky (especially if when we get there, many of them don't need their grass cut any more). So that type of $100 a day job won't be created. Not because it is a weakness in capitalism, but because socialism and regulations are in the way.


Being robbed and then having your money be given away to everyone, including you, is being robbed, not contributing to society. You shouldn't feel altruistic for being forcefully robbed. Contributing to society is doing things like farming, where you grow food for society to eat, construction, where you build houses for it to live in, engineering and tech development, where you make society's life easier, and knowing how to do all those things so you can organize people together and direct them to do it as a group, which gives society jobs, income, and meaning. Feeling "needy" because you don't have something that someone else has, voting for people to come and take stuff from that someone else, and then having those people redistribute that stuff to you and your friends, is NOT contributing to society. THAT is being greedy.


Bureaucracy is not a necessary for society. Especially not an incompetent wasteful one.


Haaaaahahaha! You ever hear of the concept of deep capture? ( Industry regulation does not balance out corporate greed, it protects corporations from competition and lets them get away with shit. Also, define corporate greed. That's a term bandied around a lot, but corporations aren't people with feelings. It's an organization that earns money by (usually) selling products and services people willingly pay for. How can it be greedy?


There's no confusion. One is simply the ultimate end of the other, based on the incentive structures it has. Government is a tool that has a society-granted monopoly on force. In the beginning, that force is rarely applied against individuals, and is typically applied towards big players that individuals fear, like big businesses and corporations. Who do you think in this scenario has more incentive to do something about such a force, insignificant individuals, or those large businesses? And who in this scenario has the resources to do something about such a force, individuals or those wealthy businesses? So, over time, despite the best of intentions, and the best of planning, as history has shown us, governments ALWAYS end up in the hands of the corrupt powerful few businesses, regardless of whether it's democratic capitalist America in the hands of bankers, or communist dictatorial USSR in the hands of oil barons. So the fault is government itself, which by its nature always becomes bad.


How can you have bad governance without government? You'll have to explain that one to me...


Current, as in while they are wielding government power???


That's not true. Not by a long shot, actually. A lot of companies focus on long term goals, because there is the only way to compete and survive nowadays. Look at the tech sector alone. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, they all have plans to implement new services and technologies over the long term, and are spending tons of money on R&amp;D instead of dumping a bunch of crap just so they can make as much money as they can as quickly as possible. Look at BitPay, Coinbase, and Mycelium. They all recognize that there are a lot of competitors in the field, and some established super powerful players to go up against. They all know that if all they do is what they are doing now (transaction processing or just having a wallet), they will not survive very long, and all have very long term development and expansion plans. The reason this short term focus on gains is so much in the public eye is because those are the companies that flare up, create a bunch of damage, and quickly burn out. They are a tiny minority among companies who are building and expanding with long term goals, and little to no problems for media to seize on.


Oh yes. I have family and friends still living there.


You don't believe that, in a direct democracy, one charismatic man who captures the popular opinion and adoration of the majority of the people =cough=Lenin=cough=Stalin=cough=Putin= won't be making all the rules? The problem with direct democracy is uninformed people thinking they know better enforcing their opinions on others, and apathy from those who don't know and don't care going along with it. The completely opposite contrast to this is people who know better putting their own money and capital on the line to get things done the way they think it should be done, and people who turn out to not really know better losing their money and influence. Which is how business works.

Supply goes up in decreasing intervals and will stop completely at 21 million bitcoin. Demand will always be there as long as bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange, and the network can be used for other programmable ledger stuff (stocks/securities, contracts, etc).

I have read bitcointalk extensively. There are a lot of complaints about delays, about refunds not being issued (despite "no refunds" being on BFL's order page), and complaints about them not answering mail. Did they actually take someone's money and say they will keep it and not send them the product? Did this convicted felon actually con people into giving him money and then not ship any products or disappear in any way? I am trying to find anything like that, but the only issues that ever come up in any of my searches are complaints about BFL promising to ship earlier than they did, and about their extreme delays. I'm not sure how legal or illegal that is, but if they did actually steal money, as you claim, I need to know.

Socialism requires government to give out money or pay for social programs. Government has only two ways of obtaining money for those purposes: collect it from wealth producers in the form of taxes, or print it through inflation (more specifically borrow it through government bonds, and then inflate away the debt). Bitcoin makes inflation not possible, and taxation extremely difficult. Assets can't be frozen or seized, and business revenue and personal income can be easily hidden, especially if businesses start moving to dealing entirely online. So if bitcoin takes off and becomes the defacto currency, there won't be money available to support socialism.

Either we sell 250 more of them and code downloadable firmware that can do Litecoin wallets, or we sell 250 more of them later, and someone else codes downloadable firmware that can do Litecoin wallets. Whether you fund the campaign to $30k or not is irrelevant to whether these devices will support Litecoin. Only difference will be whether it's as soon as they are shipped, or a few months after they are shipped.
P.S. I think all of us here at Mycelium are bitcoin types, too. I don't think anyone owns anything else, besides maybe Namecoin.

Just because other countries collapsed for other reasons does NOT mean that this country did NOT collapse due to socialism/communism. The reasons to hyperinflate money are many, sure. They can range from a dictator trying to steal wealth (Rome), to forced reparation debts (Germany after WW1), to trying to get out of extreme government debt brought on by too much government borrowing to support social programs (USSR, Venezuela, Argentina, etc). Too much socialism/communism IS one of the things that can cause hyperinflation, and was the reason here.

I know. But of all the headlines, he chose that specific one. Here are some other of his writings
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own."
"[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though."
"In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value."
Here are some more clues. Bitcoin is deflationary, following libertarian economics. Bitcoin was released after the banking crisis of 2008, as if in response to it (Satoshi may have finally lost his patience with the banking system, and spent the last few months of that year working his ass off finishing up his project). Satoshi is obviously involved in the cypherpunk movement, knowing how to use Tor and I2P, discussing bitcoin's potential for anonymous usage, posting to cryptography mailing lists, and  being very familiar with the work of other cypherpunks, like Adam Back's hashcash. He worked really hard to stay completely anonymous (which is not easy unless that's the group you are in), and worried about government crackdown on the system. Enough so that he disappeared once Wikileaks brought attention to bitcoin.
Now, let's say you are right, and Satoshi was just a computer programmer, who had no issues with government or banks or federal reserves. How would things have been different? For one, bitcoin would likely have had a steady 3% inflation. Satoshi would not have needed to stay anonymous, since his system would have been designed to be used by banks and established financial system. He would have had concerns about using bitcoin with Tor, since only people who use that would be criminals. Bitcoin itself would not have been designed to be as pseudonomous. And the headline could have been one of hundreds of other ones. For instance, if he was in England, on January 3, 2009 he likely would have been more concerned about "Plane Crashes in Staffordshire England Stranding Thousands. Three dead." since that was way more of a headline than some economics thing.


Have you actually used it? I have been using it for 1.5 years for all my purchases. It works great as a payment system. Better than credit cards.


First of all, they do endorse it by the sheer fact of adopting it. And they typically advertise that they are adopting it, thus endorsing it even more. And second, I don't get your guys' fascination with the idea that just because they use a third party processor, they don't accept bitcoin. Does by the same standard no one accepts VISA, because VISA just converts the VISA IOUs merchants get into dollars? Or maybe no one accepts dollars, because when merchants get paid with VISA, it's actually the credit card processor that accepts dollars on their behalf? That's ridiculous. Bitcoins get used to transfer value from the customer to a merchant, or a merchant's payment processor, and then some merchants keep those bitcoins, and some have them converted. But they still get paid in bitcoins, and the bitcoin transaction system is used to finalize that transaction. 


There are. Just in Silk Road alone there are thousands of users who don't actually keep any bitcoin. They buy it, spend it on Silk Road, and sellers turn around and sell the bitcoins they get paid with for cash. Those users own less than 0.1 BTC, since they in fact own no BTC, but they still use it. Apparently to the tune of hundreds or thousands of dollars a month.


Everyone who deals with people, in person, on line, and especially at conferences, knows that the number is increasing. More and more new people are finding out about it and starting to use it. Microsoft's announcement alone attracted a whole hell of a lot of newbies.


As of last May, it was $1 million worth of transactions a day, or so they claim. I doubt it's a single millionaire spending a million bucks every day.




Please. I'm dying to know.


No one claimed it was. As I said, people who have been here for a while, and who believe in technology, understand that the price is not the important thing. The technology is. Those $300 million were invested in companies that will support bitcoin the technology, because $300 million worth of wealth believes in bitcoin. Do you have a million dollars? No? Then I wouldn't consider you as financially and business savy as those who do. And those who do disagree with you.


I wish I had an eye rolling emoticon. Backing? Seriously? Backing is not a good thing. It's an IOU. You should avoid things that are backed. People got brainwashed into thinking backing is good, because they like things backed by "actual" things. Like paper backed by gold. Or stock backed by company assets. Or bonds backed by promise to repay. Or rental-backed securities. But those things are worse than having actual gold, or having actual company assets, or having the actual money that pays off that bond debt, or having the actual rental property. Bitcoin is the actual thing. It doesn't need backing.


What dividends do US dollars pay? And why are dividends important? (fyi, in the financial world, dividends are a signal that a company has gotten so big that it can't grow and innovate any more, and doesn't know what to do with all the cash it's making, so is giving it back to investors directly, instead of using it to increase the value of its stock)


Kind of like the dollar and the euro. What's your point?


then they won't be able to get any, because no one will sell them it for $30? Also, this same thing applies to dollars and euros too. Again, what's your point?


So is the price of stocks, and the value of any other emerging technology. Is it criminally wrong to sell someone a 3D printer that they can use to print a prosthetic hand for themselves, because that 3D printer may drop in value considerably when a more advanced version comes out in a few months? Is it criminal to sell someone a house, or to get them to invest in a rental property, when houses are known to fluctuate in value, and even have bubbles? Do you own any stocks or retirement plans, and do you think whoever sold them to you was criminal too, considering how the stock market crashes sometimes?

Oh, sorry, one more. The more business a merchant does with credit cards, the bigger a target he becomes. That's because merchants are required to store all credit card details for a few years (I think it's 2 in US, but I'm not sure). Since all you need to steal from a credit card is the name, address, and card number, these databases of past transactions are goldmines to hackers. That's why a single hack of Target or Home Depot databases resulted in tens of millions of compromised accounts.
Since bitcoin is a push system, like email, the only thing a bitcoin accepting merchant stores is the address the money was sent from (and maybe an address if they need to ship something). If hackers get to that database, all they will get is a list of addresses that they could send money to, but not steal from. This makes bitcoin merchant databases completely worthless, forcing hackers to work for stolen accounts one user computer at a time, which in the long run may not be profitable at all. This is also why databases of services that have hosted wallets, like exchanges, tend to get hacked often, while services that don't have your private keys, like Blockchain.info, don't. Someone stealing Blockchain.info's database will only get a few addresses and a whole bunch of useless garbage.

Pos incentivises wealth concentration, and stake as a security against bad actors is kind of a myth. Would I force the currency to inflate if I had a huge personal stake in it? Sure! Central banks do it all the time. Just print some amount of new money, use half of it to buy another asset, and keep the other half to maintain your stake. The inflation effects will only be realized after you make your purchase, you still have the same level of wealth/stake you had before, and you can do this indefinitely to just give yourself free money to spend on things.

The buyers absorbed $9 million worth in 1 hour when bitcoin hit $300. There are tons of people on the sidelines waiting to buy cheap bitcoins, and many more new people coming in to buy it up, according to the number of new wallet accounts being opened. And should ETFs be approved later this year, there will be billions of Wall Street money finally being able to get in, which has had to sit on the sidelines all this time due to restrictions in what mutual funds and hedge funds can invest in.
Your math is missing a lot of variables. It's also missing the fact that decreasing price also means decreasing amount needed to be absorbed. At $50 a coin it only needs to absorb $180k worth of bitcoin, not $1.4 mil, which is very easy.

Yes, yes you do. As the country's economy gets stronger, or weaker, so does its currency. Some people have made a lot of money on such investments (George Soros). But the problem with dollars is that their amount is not fixed, it's impossible to predict when more will be dumped on the market, and it's impossible to know the number of outstanding "shares." So it doesn't compare to stocks very well.


Are you sure us dollar cash has no cash flow? What do you mean when you say cash flows?


You just wrote the definition of a conglomerate. Different businesses, with different business models, with different profits, all a part of a larger whole. I think you don't know what that word means. For example, 3M is a famous conglomerate, manufacturing "adhesives, abrasives, laminates, passive fire protrction, dental and orthodontic products, electronic materials, medical products, car care products, electronic circuits, and optical firlms." 3M's goal is to invent something new every year, kr buy a company that did, and sell off any companies that are underperforming. When you invest in 3M stock, you are not investing in a single business, you are investing in, as you said, "different businesses, with different business models, with different profits." AmEx is not a conglomerate, but Bitcoin is very similar to one.


So, because Buffet only invests in large, established, non-tech businesses, Google, stock is pure speculation, and shouldn't be invested in? I don't get your point.




Again, what's your point? Enron, Lehman Brothers, and lots of other businesses are no longer around. Are you saying they were all ex post facto speculations and not investments?


Are you saying everything on the stock market that you can buy shares in is investments, and not speculations? Cause a lot of professional investors who buy stocks in exploratory mining companies would disagree with you (sometimes they find oil/gold/whatever, sometimes they go bust).




The fact that every stock share sold on the stock market today has an average of four claimants to it, due to lack of safety regulations forbidding fractional reserve types of activities by brokerages, and that if there was a run on the sale of stocks, your shares could end up being worthless scams (did you know about this?), and the fact that the only thing the stock market regulates for is making sure that the shares are legitimate, not that the underlying businesses themselves aren't scams (which happens more often than it should) aside...
What is it about owning bitcoin that makes you think you are being scammed? You either own a share in an economy thatis rapidly expanding with a lot of new businesses, or you don't. Hell, one of the long term plans is to move all stock trades entirely onto blockchain technologies, making most of what the stock market uses regulations for obsolete.




You should probably read this 
Google, Facebook, and Twitter were very well established companies pre-IPO, with a large enough customer base, and advanced enough technology and competitive advantage that there was little chance they would fail. It's the same deal with bitcoin.


Neither do stocks! The companies that you own a share of have cash flow and profits, which usually translate into shares of stock going up as the company assets increase, either from their inventory going up in value, or **more cash going going into the company.** Does that sound familiar? What happens when bitcoin services are used by users? More cash goes into bitcoin.


I would have thought it was because gold is a terrible investment, only gaining 3% return over it's life long term. And yeah, gold is a speculative investment, with its price being almost entirely from it being used as a store or value or a hedge against other currencies, not as part of any business or service that actually generates cash flow.


Sure it is. Finished reading that investopedia article? Now look at the fundamentals of bitcoin. Look at the adoption of the service it provides, the market cap it is establishing, its future prospects, the services and products companies are working on that they plan to release soon. LOTS of fundamentals to consider and invest based on. Why do you think the general feelin g around bitcoin is that it because!e much stronger in 2014, despite the drop in price? Its because the fundamentals have improved so much. You don't have that in speculations.


When I buy bitcoin, and the reason I hold it, is because I am buying a claim on bitcoin infrastructure's long term cash flows.

I am frequently a customer. It is more secure for me, because I don't have to worry about my account being frozen due to large or international transactions (happened once, all my money got locked for over a month, and nearly lead to bankruptcy), and I don't have to worry about my credit card or personal details being stolen. It is MUCH faster, because to pay with it I just pull out my phone, scan a qr code, and hit send, while for the other method I have to hunt down my wallet in some pants' pocket, and then spend a lot of time manually typing in my card number and all my personal details. With KryptoKit browser plugin, I don't even need to do anything but click twice.


Math guarantees that my private key makes my bitcoins spendable, and the bitcoin network guarantees that the transaction will be propagated.


Sorry, you must be foreign. When a card is declined, that means that the merchant tried to use the card you gave them, but the bank issuing that card declined the transaction. The "decline" is something done by the banks, not the merchant, and could happen if you turn out to have insufficient funds (there's nothing on the credit card to tell you how much money you have), or if the bank just decides they think your transaction is suspicious, or puts a hold on your account, which could happen for any number of reasons.


Assuming you are buying from one of a small handful of countries where it works. But, KryptoKit is just click on a browser button, and when the pop up comes up showing the address and amount, just click send. Two clicks. No harder than PayPal (which may ask for your login and password)


I haven't had to buy bitcoin to afford things in quite a while. A year ago it was $100. Plus I can easily buy on Coinbase right before buying elsewhere if I'm worried about volatility, which I'm not.


Nope. You basically said bitcoin is worse for all customers, I said it's better for me, so your "all" was wrong. Had you said "for most customers, especially ones that don't use bitcoin that often," you'd have been right.

Browsing on the phone, clicking the QR code will bring up your wallet, then log you in. On the laptop or computer, storing private keys isn't very safe. That's why bitcoin users are recommended to use cold storage, or use strong passwords, which still don't help against keyloggers or malware that monitors memory. Android and I phones are much more secure.
Right now people use passwords, and very few people use password managers, so main hacker targets are sites themselves, which store copies of those passwords. If something like BitID becomes popular, hackers will be interested in stealing BitID keys from your own computer as much as they are interested in bitcoin.

$10k is fixed since its an actual value, not a nominal value subject to inflation. So it was $1,000,000 * (1 + inflation rate) ^ -(number of years) - $10,000 = 0 (or just = $10,000). Use negative for number of years to reduce the value by inflation, and adjust the years until the result is as close to zero as possible. (You can use a formula that directly solves for time, but it's nowhere near as simple).

Mycelium will not work without our servers. We will be adding support for SPV as a failover precaution, but some functions will still depend on our servers, such as LocalTrader, direct Tor connections, and CoinJoin, the later of which we are still working on. In any case, we use a standard backup, so if the wallet stops working, you can just import it into other wallets.
There is nothing stopping people from connecting to our services with their own code. Implementing Tor is being done not just for anonymity, but for DDoS protection.
Yeah, we know it's restrictive. In practice we are not as restrictive as the license requires. Really the only rule is that anyone is free to do whatever they want with the code, but we want to be the ones to publish the final branded version of the wallet. We are in seemingly constant talks about going fully open source, but we are not sure how that will impact future functionality we have planned, so keep putting it off until we start working on those functions.

There's a big list here 
The other topic often discussed is dangers from Quantum Computers and 51% attacks. Quantum computer issue is easily fixed by switching to a quantum-secure algorithm. Bitcoin is even able to run on two algorithms at the same time, allowing miners with old hardware to continue to support the network as they slowly migrate to new Quantum algorithm hardware. But since QC's are nowhere near a threat right now, we don't bother.
As for 51% attack issue, that is an issue similar to MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction). Practically ALL 51% attack scenarios have been considered at this point, and mitigation or counterattacks for all of them have been devised, many of which would make the attacker's hardware obsolete, making all the resources they put into the attack worthless while keeping bitcoin going. Because this is public knowledge, no one is attacking the network, knowing they will be screwed if they try, and because everyone knows that attackers know they will be screwed, no one is bothering to implement countermeasures at this time. Just knowing that they are there, and knowing that attackers know that they are there, is enough to keep thing safe.

That's what a bitcoin wallet does, it splits your bitcoin among separate addresses containing smaller amounts. The wallet total may be a lot, but the individual pieces are small. I have probably lost about $5 to $10 worth myself, both though user error, and by losing some small paper wallets.

Yes, technologies, like businesses, fail all the time. Almost the only reason they fail after being launched is because something better comes along and kills them (cheaper, or more efficient, or has better functionality) Bitcoin's time to fail was about two or three years ago. It overcame that time of obscurity, none of the other competing technologies or altcoins managed to overtake it, and here we are. Sure, it might fail some time in the future, but it won't be in a vacuum, for absolutely no reason. It will only be because something comes along that is as better than bitcoin, as bitcoin is better than the current financial system.

Ah, so if I understand this correctly, SafeCoins are fixed in quantity, so the only variables are cost of storage, which decreases, and need for storage, which increases as more and more people store stuff.

I'm not saying that Al all. If capitalists are irresponsible in a capitalist society, their business is killed off by competition (check out how Sears is doing). If corrupt capitalists get in bed with government to make a fascist system, or if corrupt government appropriates capitalist businesses in exchange for favors and bailouts in a communist system, and then that business fails and takes government down with it, then the reason government fell was due to it getting merged with business, be it fascist or communist. So, again, BOTH fascist AND communist AND just corrupt governments in general can lead to hyperinflation, BUT the cause of hyperinflation is 100% the fault of government that controls the currency it prints.
In Venezuela's case, it was corrupt government doing communist things by appropriating businesses, instead of letting them be privately owned, and letting those private companies take the fall from declining oil prices, instead of BEING the oil business like a communist state, and getting hurt by oil prices directly.
Care to explain to me how corrupt capitalists or "neo-cons" could cause hyperinflation without them being involved with government?

That's what I was thinking. If they get an address they know is BitPay's once in a while, and then see that address be spent together with others... Granted this would only let them link addresses after every spend. I wonder why BitPay hasn't implemented CoinJoin yet, since that would completely break the assumption that all merged addresses are theirs. Or maybe they have, in which case if that methodology is actually being used here, then it's already including addresses that aren't theirs.
For an experiment, here is an address that I own 
Note, I DO NO have 16995.98616617 bitcoin. Not even close! And many of the identified services listed there I have never even used (Bitstamp, NitrogenSports, etc)
@_date: 2014-05-08 05:49:17


No, that should be fine.


It uses BIP32 HD wallets. Basically it creates a random number, and then your address 1 is RandomNumer+1, address 2 is RandomNumber+2, and so on. As long as you back up that single random number, you can restore all the addresses that Armory will create.


Armory will scan through the first I think 1000 addresses, and you can tell it to scan through more.
Since you are using Mycelium to spend from cold storage anyway, you may be better off just generating a paper wallet at bitaddress.org or bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Download that page and generate a wallet while your PC is not connected to the internet. Mycelium spends from cold storage, and sends all change right back to the same address. The only benefit you'd get from Armory is if you wanted to stay more anonymous by using different addresses, and moving coins to a new address once in a while. If that's all you need, you may be better off using Electrum, which also uses HD wallets, but takes up much less space than Armory.

@_date: 2014-12-30 05:42:52
One more point about merchants taking the hit on theft: Since credit card companies aren't affected (much), and they have a monopoly on the payment service (a merchant dropping VISA will lose all VISA customers, so must keep accepting VISA), there is practically no incentive for credit card companies to work on improving security. And so, at least in US, we are still stuck with plain plastic cards and numbers, instead of chip &amp; pin systems in other countries.
Oh, and that segues into another benefit. If the merchant accepts bitcoin, he doesn't care if I use Blockchain.info, Mycelium, Breadwallet, or whatever else, and I don't care if he uses BitPay, Coinbase, or accepts bitcoin directly. If some service screws him, he can just dump it and go with someone else without losing customers. Open platform that is completely interchangeable, means lots more options, competition, and potential for improvement.
@_date: 2014-08-28 16:31:18


Not all. It's still possible to send a low/zero fee transaction that fits the priority limits, then create a higher fee one later, and have a pool include the higher fee one instead of the first one. Plus double spends can happen if some miners hear about one transaction, and others about a different one. Thus you watch for when the merchant submits his, and with your finger on the button instantly submit yours directly to the major pools. It won't work every time, but you may get lucky enough times for it to be a problem.
@_date: 2014-09-02 15:34:26
Miners still compete against other miners. If some miner decides that everyone should pay $5 fees, all other miners will take his transactions and lower fees. The competition incentive is driving fees down to zero.
Note that it's still possible to send transactions with fees below 0.0001, and even for free.

When I said bug, I meant bug in their design.
Reissuing transactions was automatic, as we found out recently.
Thefts could have taken over the course of many months, or, with the automated reissuing, over just a few weeks.
If it did happen quickly, auditing their financial data, which happens periodically, not continuously, may not have caught it until it was way way too late.
The idea of regulators auditing code is, frankly, laughable. These things are done by private third party companies like McAfee, not government regulations.
US regulations would not have been applicable to MtGox, since they are in Japan, and if regulations had been passed there, they likely would have just moved. Don't forget, MtGox didn't even start out in Japan (I forgot if it was in France or US), and moved there later.
I have no idea what you are talking about with regards to the cold storage issue, but as far as know, the cold storage we don't have enough information to comment or speculate on. Maybe it was not fully "cold," and was automatically refilling the hot wallet. Maybe it was drained some other way. We don't know.
I don't know of any regulations that specifically regulate against bugs. There are general security practices that companies handling financial data must follow, but I'm skeptical any red flags would have been raised for something that was working fine for over two years.

We (along with other bitcoin developers) are trying to get people away from single addresses and address reuse. You can still create multiple accounts and segregate funds. They would just be stored in accounts instead of addresses.
Well be adding the option to share xpub let's in a later version, and you can still share your single address. All prior addresses in an HD account are still monitored for any new money coming in.
If you still have to use single addresses, you can generate them using another source (such as Mycelium Entropy), and we will know that you have a backup since you would be importing the private key from elsewhere.

You can't propagate a different transaction if the transaction is already signed. Sure, you can create your own transaction, with your own private keys and bitcoin spends, but the device won't care, and will only consider it's transaction sent once it hears about it from the blockchain. You can do MITM, but someone else will transmit the right transaction eventually once they hear about it.

That depends on whether you believe the USD is here to stay. I don't think people involved with this thing believe that.

Countries hostile to US, or even ones that don't use USD, will likely not adopt this, while having no problems with Bitcoin.

Yes, that's one of the workaround we're considering. We're working to add a database to the wallet, which would allow for things like notes/descriptions for transactions (so you can remember what you spent that 23.435 mBTC on), prices at the time of transaction, etc. That database would be used for something like this, too. Only problem is, there's no way to tell whether a BIP32 address is a one-time-use thing, with the user having multiple BIP32's, and it may make the storage size bloat quickly if multiple such seeds are used.
The other problem is keeping it synchronized. If you spend from that wallet on another machine, Mycelium will have no way of knowing that, unless it rescans everything. Maybe a specific "Refresh wallet balance" button can be added that can only be run manually...
Either way, we'll definitely get there. It'll just take a bit of time. Incidentally, Mycelium is hiring software developers  specifically to speed things like this up, so if you know anyone...

Read it again. The topic that YOU started was guns and crime rates. Euros, and currency, has nothing to do with it. My reply to your claim is that, despite US having a lot more guns, no one is actually allowed to use them, and can get in BIG trouble if they use them to defend themselves. It's why news about someone killing themselves to "Stand their ground" are such a big sensation. Hell, in my state, you are not even allowed to have your gun anywhere outside of your own house.


existing **and fighting against** a completely NOT capitalist environment.


The logic is very simply. It is EXTREMELY costly to prohibit people from doing what they want if that something does not harm others (if it does, those others will raise the money to stop it themselves). In business, it is also EXTREMELY expensive to waste resources fighting your competitors directly with violence. At the least, you risk losing your employees. It is much cheaper to compete by either out-innovating your competitor, collaborating with them for mutualbenefit, or just buy them outright. For an example of what cartels are like WITHOUT a fascist militarized government trying to fight them at every step, please read this:  (and the part on Protection Rackets). Note that the goal is to both have a threatening and scary reputation, AND to be as least violent as possible so as not to piss off customers. They walk a fine line.


In practice they are the same. People in Africa are getting the basics needed for survival, like food. As a result, farmers, who are the very first and basic types of capitalists needed for a country to develop, are **not able to compete** with the free food, and can't start their own businesses and earn their own money. In the end, the areas that receive aid are stuck being dependent on that aid, and the economies of those areas were suppressed, or even destroyed. UBI poses the same risks, where entrepreneurs wishing to start certain businesses will not be able to compete against UBI based income, and thus will not be able to hire workers or get their business off the ground.


On the contrary, i'm an atheist, an engineer by family relation (my genes are full of famous scientists), and a polymath by trade. Thanks for the article. It was an interesting reed. Now here are some other data points to consider. The BIG was implemented from January 2008 to December 2009. Note the inflation rate of the currency here  During BIG, it jumped all the way up to 12%, and after BIG ended, dropped back down to 4%-6%. That's what BIG, and things like minimum wages do. Also, note that the experiment in Namibia, and those in India, are all very limited in scale, and are applied only to the subset of the currency region, meaning their income is being supported by the surrounding economic areas. If UBI were to be implemented on a country-wide area, you would see economic effects that were not possible to see here, such as increased overall taxes to pay for it, increased business flight to countries that don't have such tax requirements, and increased currency inflation, requiring a continuing cycle of increasing cost of living adjustments for UBI payments. The reason it will cause inflation is because the value of a currency is subject to the same supply/demand effects as any other commodity, and if you have a lot more currency chasing the same burger (increased supply), whoever is selling that burger will be able to demand more for that burger.
On the other hand, here is how poverty in China was reduced from 84% to 10%  UBI on a national level is something that can be established by countries that already have a stable source of tax revenue and a large established economy. I'll grant you that it is a better system than the system of welfare we have now.


I actually have never even heard such a distinction, and had to google it to figure out what the hell the difference is. I still can't tell the difference. Best I got is that personal you use personally, and private you either own remotely, or is something you use to make a profit off of? It's still not a good distinction, since you can make profits using personal property. Maybe you can explain what the difference is a bit better? Until you do, I don't even know how to respond.
By the way, why do you call it libertarian *right* or capitalist *fundamentalist*? What are the words "right" or "fundamentalist" actually mean? Because to me they just sound like meaningless words, as if I was to call you socialist isosceles.


Except that UBI requires a governing authority to either create money, or collect it from others, so that the UBI can be paid. A governing authority that by its very definition can't exist in an anarchic society.


Wait, what? Are you claiming that those jobs exist only as charity, so that worthless people without any skills have something to do and can support their families?! No, man! Those jobs exist because those jobs have to be done. Floors won't mop and burgers won't flip themselves. People want those things done, so they create jobs and pay for them to be done. Is it the employer's fault that there are so many people clamoring for that one stupid humiliating job? You are trying to shift the blame off the mass of unskilled uneducated labor, and onto someone who just needs shit done and pays market rates for it.


The "company" is not a person. It's not some fat car in a top hat and a monocle driving around in a Rolls Royce. That $1 that I make for the company is owned by company shareholders. And those shareholders are people like you and me. Anyone with a savings or a retirement account (which someone who makes $50k definitely should be having).


Actually it does. Say you are earning $10 and others are earning $0 to $1. Those earning nothing say they are poor, and demand UBI. With UBI, you are now earning $8, and others are earning $1.5 and $0.5. Yay, things ae a bit more evin. So you go and expand your company, making more stuff for more people, and are back to earning $10. Oh no, the UBI people, despite having much more than they had before, feel poor compared to you again. So they get the UBI increased. Now you are earning $8 again, and they are earning $2 and $1. And every time you do that, they will keep bringing you back down. Look at the level of support we give to unemployed welfare recipients now, compared to 50 years ago. People get used to the new stuff they get, keep comparing themselves to those who are making a lot, and keep raising the poverty level and social support requirements.

Besides, look at the evidence. USA is being sustained entirely by borrowing (that's what a budget deficit means). Our debts are being considered increasingly more risky, and are approaching levels where all we would be able to afford to pay is just interest. Countries that buy our debt are becoming increasingly more hostile and skeptical of us, and are dumping dollar reserves while looking for alternatives.

This is the first time in history that it literally does. A single word, albeit 250 characters in length, can be literally worth thousands of dollars, as long as it follows the generally accepted language structure, and anyone is free to use that language with the help of their computers, or even pencil and paper if they are mathematically inclined. So as long as people find that language convenient to use (since barriers to entry are almost nonexistent), it will continue to exist. Open source free tools, and languages, are way more resilient than institutions that must rely on guns to continue to exist. Thus, its a pretty good bet that one will simply outlast the other.

This would require the printer to scan image files for things that look like QR codes, process those codes to see if they are bitcoin codes, and then replace them in the image on the fly. I don't know if printers have the resources to do that right now, but I sort of doubt it. Also, you will be able to verify that the key printed is correct using the second page, which will show parts of the entropy source, or print a 2-of-3 print, which will be really difficult for the printer to figure out as being a part of a bitcoin key.
The second one would require the printer to be able to store things. Most are only able to in volatile ram, which is lost when you reset it. Unless they manage to store it in the printer's firmware space...

No difference. The mining algorithm uses a threshold, where everything above 0.0001 is included as long as the block still has enough space for it, and everything below 0.0001 is relegated to the "free space" section, meaning it may be included if there is enough space in the block after the proper fees are all included, or just excluded completely as a "free" transaction, depending on how the pool is set up.

Difficult and expensive compared to the costs that they should be at. The devices will be using very basic and cheap hardware, which will cost $X to manufacture. Installing a back door will require more expensive chips, which will add $Y to the total cost. If we order lots of units for $X, and they cost the manufacturer $X + $Y to make, the manufacturer will basically be selling tons of these at a loss, in the hopes that whatever back door they add may pay off in the future. 
All the software and hardware schematics will also be open source, so users can look them over, maybe even compare what's in their devices, and verify the security themselves. We hope some will take the time to do this.
In the end, you would basically have to trust that we did our best in making sure no one changed anything during the process.

As a rule, you should ALWAYS back up your wallets BEFORE you send any money to them.

You are right. It has to do with whether the wealthy people invested in it have enough interest in securing their money and keep it going. I.e. you can pretty much bet that if something better does come out, and threatens bitcoin's existence if it's not implemented, all those wealthy bitcoin early adopters and the VCs that already sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into it will pay quite a lot to make sure that it DOES get implemented.

Drug dealers have the inconvenience of having to use cash for almost everything, and laundering their money to make it look like it's coming from a legit income to be able to deposit it into a bank to use over long distance. Bitcoin does that with pointing your phone and scanning a QR code, whether you are buying in person or online. MUCH easier and more convenient. It's like giving you a credit card with built in anonymization and laundry services, which everyone uses by default. Like having your own little crooked accountant right in your phone :D


Sure, but Overstock doesn't report you to the financial authorities. Banks that send your money to Overstock do. Also, using services like Purse and Brokr, someone else buys them for you as gifts. Or you can do that for yourself, too. So, there's no way to tell if you bought it, or if you got a gift. And, again, IRS and financial regulators would have to start requesting customer records from businesses, which businesses will NOT like, since it would basically subject them to the same reporting requirements as banks.


Not really. Trezor is a type of cold storage. Spending from a paper wallet is spending from cold storage. Carying a tiny cheap laptop with Armory with you, which never connects to the web, but lets you create signed transactions offline to pull a bit of spending money out is cold storage. Soon Android wallets will implement TrustZone, which will let you store bitcoins in a secure separate hardware layer right on your phone, being effectively cold storage on your Android. Compare that to a rock, which you have to find someone to buy (at a huge discount probably), for which you get ALL the money out, thus having to lug a lot of cash around, and which you have to use to buy another rock (again, at a loss) when you want to move again.

The main, and really only, issue with this article is that currency values are relative. If bitcoin, the title, is worth more than the dollar, the IOU, then their exchange rate will simply be different to reflect that. So, a $1USD worth of bitcoin will be worth EXACTLY $1USD worth of fiat paper, since the cost of the IOU will already have been reflected in the price (and thus 1BTC is worth $600 dollars). Because of this difference, people won't notice the price advantage. They will just see different exchange rates. The only examples where they may see the price difference is in an ounce of gold vs a note backed by an oz of gold (the note will be worth less on the free market), or possibly a bitcoin on your wallet vs a bitcoin stored with Coinbase, Circle, or some other third party (for example, compare a Bitcoin in your wallet to a bitcoin held at MtGox).
Otherwise, the author may have a point, albeit a simpler one, that people will value things they possess and control themselves more than things that are IOUs backed by someone else. If not due to the inherent cost of the IOU, then at least because they simply have way more control and access to things they control directly, as opposed to directing a third party to control it for you. Anyone who has used bitcoin for a while already knows how much easier and straightforward it is to deal with, compared to the dollars in your bank.

I still contend that those weren't "spam attacks" but hundreds of millions of dollars of new investment trying to move in, and that they have "abated" because the high fees demonstrated that bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream yet, causing the bubble and interments to pop. While I still support BTC, I think this was a massive mistake that may have set it back a year or more.

Personally, I think it's OK to repeat facts. It's the bullshit that bothers me. Kinda like morons repeating "the earth is 6,000 years old, created by an intelligent designer" is not quite the same as teachers constantly repeating "the earth is 6.5 billion years old, made of stardust pulled together by gravity."
Mostly it's just tiresome having to address and dispel the same old myths and lies over and over and over again (all of these I have heard, and more than once):
Bitcoin deflation will make it so expensive it will become worthless.
Bitcoin takes 10 minutes to process, and thus can't work for a cup of coffee
There's nothing stopping from someone just making a bunch of copies of bitcoin, and crashing the market, since it's just digital
Bitcoin was created by the NSA to track people, and has security backdoors
Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme created by Satoshi to scam people, and when he gets rich enough, will just dump it and run with everyone's money
Satoshi included a kill switch in bitcoin, and will just turn it off when he makes enough from the suckers.
If (my) government bans bitcoin, it will be worthless.
Bitcoin will be killed when my government/bank simply makes its own bitcoin.
Bitcoin is only used by criminals to buy drugs.
Bitcoin is only used by teenagers who don't understand how money/economics works, and who don't have any money themselves.
The only reason people use or promote bitcoin is for speculation and get rich schemes.
People who use bitcoin are all libertarians.
Bitcoin is too volatile to use as a currency.
Customers don't get any benefits for using bitcoin over their own banks.
Bitcoin is insecure, and things like scams and MtGox are part of how it actually works.
Bitcoin doesn't scale, and it being able to only do 7 transactions per second is all this system will ever be able to do.
Bitcoin security issues are inherent in how it works, and can't be fixed.
Bitcoin fluctuates 20% a day.
No one needs bitcoin because I have a credit card.
Bitcoin is nothing new, and works just like the current banking system, so it's not even needed.
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:51:40


Except that they HAVE to use Bitcoin to use Realcoin. It's running on top of the Mastercoin protocol, which runs on top of bitcoin. There's no real way to take it off of bitcoin without losing it's decentralized nature and making it basically a system of accounts that banks use now.
By the way, this "competing alt-coin" you are so angry about is he US dollar. The **only** difference is that now this US dollar will be easier to send and receive. It still has the problem of **being the US dollar.** Crap for foreign countries, and international trade. I mean, you guys are basically freaking out over Dwolla 2.0

Computers have shared storage and shared memory space. I don't know about iPhones, but Android apps all run in completely separate virtual machines. The apps are completely unaware of other apps, their storage, or their memory contents, unless your phone is rooted, and you give an app exclusive right to go look elsewhere. PC's apps, on the other hand, can often read other program's memory, and have full access to the shared hard drive. Especially Windows PCs that are used by the majority of the people. So that's why I say that phones are more secure. True, my cold storage PC that is never connected to the web, and signs everything remotely, is the most secure system possible, but almost no one has such a setup, and too many people use unsecured PCs. So moving them to phones is the easiest option.
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:51:04
And it won't. Increase in adoption, and increase in price per Bitcoin (or rather market cap) will greatly decrease volatility. That's how commodities, stocks, and currencies work: the bigger they get, the harder it is to move them, and the more stable the price. Right now it is a problem, since it's still in beta and still a teeny tiny market, but that won't always be the case.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:18:13


... then, with Android OS being open source, someone would have likely noticed that. Unless it was an app installed on top of the OS later by the manufacturer, but with the huge developer community around Android OS (unlike Apple's btw), there's a damn good chance that people are doing things like tracking exactly what information is being sent out of their phones, and would have caught something like this if it had existed.
As for the issue in the article, I somewhat doubt the FBI is downloading everyone's information, since they still need warrants to do that, which, although are given without question, aren't given to cover everyone. (thanks for the info though. Good incentive to install a custom ROM)

Fine with me. I quit them back in May a year ago. I don't work for any wallets, but my favorite is Edge, since it supports SegWit and other cryptos, and let's you pick custom fees (I pay 1-2 cents a tx now).


Almost 6 months after SegWit was implemented, after fees hit $30, and possibly due to investors fleeing BTC, instead of actual scalability being implemented.

What's going on is that about 7 trusted treasurers were picked, most of the money was divided among them, and only one has so far sent his money back.

Our servers parse the entire blockchain into a searchable database, which is now over 100gigs in size.

MtGox was owned and operated by people who were trusted in the Bitcoin community (which was a rarity way back in 2011 when pretty much no one knew about Bitcoin), registered as a corp, which I imagine required all government filings including finance and taxes, and they were audited monthly by the Japan Finance Authority (or whatever). So it wasn't like it was just servers in some kid's basement.
Also, the only thing it had to do with Magic the Gathering is the name. The original exchange for trading cards was written by a hobbyint, who sold it to the guys running MtGox now. Then, after the June 2011 crash from $30 due to a security flaw in the exchange, they scrapped the entire thing and rewrote the whole exchange from sratch. So, completely different owners, completely different management, completely different software, and completely different servers. There is literally nothing left of the old Magic the Gathering exchange other than the name, which they kept due to brand name recognition.

Avoid investments. You won't find anything with a higher return than Bitcoin right now.
Use localbitcoin / LocalTrader, and if you can use Coinbase, buy the coins right back for the full amount of cash as soon as you get it (just keep in mind the 1% fee, so sell for higher than that). It will typically take them at least a day to pull money out of your account; plenty of time to drive to the bank and make a deposit long after you've done the trade and bought the coins back.
Good idea on buying a bit every paycheck. It's a good idea whether you are investing in bitcoin, or any other investment. I started doing just $150 every fortnight. It really adds up!

That's true. We've already seen three bubbles, one to $30, one to $266, and one to $1,200. More will likely come. I'm hoping that once everyone who could ever consider it starts using it, there won't be as many, or as significant, shocks.
The confidence has to be in the blockchain technology, not just the currency. Even if bitcoins themselves were worthless, if companies started issuing stock shares using Colored Coin, or something similar, there would still be a demand for the currency, since it's the only thing running on top of the blockchain tech. Though I suspect the BRICs and developing countries will adopt it as currency first. Theirs isn't doing all that well :) (tough China's just isn't trusted)

Regarding Finney, most mining is now done in pools. Do you know if it's possible to request a pool node for a transaction it's currently mining? We cul do that, and then if one of the pools lies, we can point out that it reported one TX, but mined a different one.

Sorry, but doublespending is about as much "counterfeiting" as doing a chargeback with your credit card. Functionally it's exactly the same, where you receive a transaction, only to have it get reversed later. Neither one actually creates fake currency, since doublespending still has to involve real bitcoins, and neither increases the amount of outstanding currency, causing overall inflation and currency devaluation, since in both cases the same money that was paid is simply pulled back and used elsewhere.

We keep words one at a time to prevent any screenshot or sneaky photo scenarios. It's basically a tad more secure. Good point on the backup seed being hidden.

Hopefully that will be added as this thing catches up to our Android version.
Agreed on the UI. We are having someone redesign our Android one, since it was originally designed around old Android 2's, and we all agree it is in a desperate need of an update. Looks like this one just followed our same old Android design. Will have to update this one once we're done with Android, too.

Actually, Trezor-like security is already available in Android on ARM CPUs v9 and up. That hardware security is just not implemented yet due to it being so new and due to phone manufacturers not turning it on (may need custom drivers or something). There is a company that has been at the Texas and Toronto conferences that is working on unlocking and implementing that system, and if they get it going (hopefully by end of this year), your Android wallet will be as, or more, secure than Trezor.

BIP70 mostly solves this issue, by having the merchants do the transaction broadcasting.

IF Retailers do not pay the 3% that they get charged by credit cards, then who is? Where is the money to cover those 3% charge fees coming from? Where is the money to cover the 3% annual losses from chargebacks coming from?
If rewards cancel out the 3% fees, then who pays for the consumer protection? Is the risk coverage a free service provided by credit card banks from their generosity?
Bitcoin costs 0.25% to 1% in, depending on where you buy, and will cost less and less as more options are available, since bitcoin sellers will have to compete. Bitcoin costs at most 1% out, but can cost way less than that if you use the $30/month unlimited transactions option. And likewise, with more businesses taking care of the "out" coming in and competing, the fee will decrease as well. With credit cards there is no competition. Either you accept whatever VISA and MasterCard gives you, or you don't accept credit cards. Open platforms allow for way more innovation at way cheaper prices. Just look at what VOIP and Skype did to the old long distance service phone companies used to have monopoly on.

You are right about the hacker vulnerability. So you shouldn't use this function for life savings sized amounts until Rivetz is done with whatever they're doing. It's probably not much of a risk for smaller amounts, since the memory where that address is loaded is already pretty well protected.
The mathematical weakness is going to come once quantum computers become fast enough. Hopefully by then we will change the cryptographic algorithm.
You are right about the privacy, though, but if you use this same address to add money to your HD wallet instead of using it to pay directly, it will look like it's paying to different unknown addresses (unknown since you are the only one who knows them), so might help mitigate that a bit.

That's because no one is allowed to actually defend themselves, and those who are in charge of that, the police, are woefully incompetent, and are not even legally obligates to defend anyone. We have no cases of private security providing public defender, except maybe in Detroit, where the general opinion is that they are much better than police.


This about it. Why are Mexican drug cartels so armed, so afraid, and are fighting so violently? Mexico isn't a right libertarian state, it's a left, corrupt, militarized nation where drugs are illegal, and government police is waging war with cartels. If it was a libertarian state, no one would bother those drug cartels, and they'd have no reason to fight, other than to compete against each other. And even that competition is severely economically skewed, since the price of what they sell is ridiculously high. If drugs weren't illegal, they would be so cheap that fighting another cartel for territory wouldnt make sense financially.


The closest analogue to extreme poverty and universal basic income we have is Africa, where a lot of food and aid is sent, and has been sent for decades. Africa is still a shithole. The best example of eradication of poverty we have is Asia and India, where over 1 billion people were pulled out of poverty in just the last two decades, without anyone even noticing, taking credit, or exclaiming how great of an accomplishment it was. That wasn't achieved with UBI, but with those nations opening themselves up to capitalism and investors. Over a billion people were hired, and received even increasing wages, just because the world's economy was expanding, and a lot of companies were moving out of the more expensive countries that do have UBI of sorts in the form of welfare.
 &gt; It's really hard to take right libertarians seriously when they call themselves anarcho-capitalists. 
Why do you say it's "right" libertarianism? Most anarchic capitalists are very liberal, support gay rights, are atheist, support freedom of choice, oppose drug restrictions, etc.


What does capitalism, an economic position, have to do with anarchy, a political position? You can be pro government capitalist, pro government socialist, and anti government capitalist and socialist. Anarcho simply means we don't support rulers, and capitalist simply means we support the idea that everyone should have a right to their own property. People can freely trade without government oversight, and do so all the time. There are also anarcho-communists, which is probably closer to what you are familiar, where they don't think government should exist, and everyone should just share equally.


That is a very loaded question. For example, is it the right thing to do to donate your kidney, or even vital organs, if all your organs can save the loves of 6 other people? It is 100%. So why aren't you going to the hospital to donate kidneys, or committing suicide in front of it so they can use your organs to save many more people?


No it doesn't! Being a charity case, and leeching off spciety, while feeling that you can't contribute anything to it, is not respectful at all. Some people do get used to that setup, and just sit around being parasites, but relying on handouts is very much the opposite of being respected. It's being told you are worthless, but here's something for you to live on, because everyone feels sorry for you. Actually contributing something to the world and being rewarded for your contribution is getting respect.


Tax, tax, tax. That's always the solution for any social program idea. How will you impose such tax, when you won't have a way to track people's wealth, consumption, or earnings? How will you tax, when the only thing nyou can track is physical property, and taxing it at the levels required to support modern governments would make living in that territory so expensive that all wealthy people and companies will leave, and all poor that need that UBI won't be able to afford rent?
You can't just create wealth out of thin air. Governments sure don't create it. So, the only option is to get it from those who do create things, and be careful enough not to make them go away. Bitcoin makes it much easier to go away.


Personally I don't care. I'm a non-materialist minimalist. As long as I have a roof, good and enough food, a warm bed, my woman and my friends I'm happy. The house will be done when it's done. It's not even important and I'm certainly not going to build my whole ideological and economic system around repressing others so I can have my things quicker. 
You would have fit perfectly in USSR then. Three or four generations of families all living in the same apartment, waiting years, if not decades, for available housing, having plenty of cheap food that is limited to bread, milk, potatoes, and on rare occasion fish or beef, barely anything available in stores, with no choices between products. That's what you get when everyone decides to distribute everything evenly. Sure, USSR was not a direct democracy, but the economic outcome would pretty much be the same.






Sure you can! You and your friends and family can move to the forest, or some abandoned island in the carribean, or an uninhabited coast of a South American country, grow your own food, build your own huts, and share everything equally, where no one owns anything, trades anything, and the only incentive to do any work whatsoever is for the good of everyone else.

Gee, thanks. With my advanced degrees in the subject, I wasn't aware of that concept 9.9  So, tell me, how does time value of money help with the money that I own being able to buy half to a third of what it could before? And doesn't this also mean that stocks and investments haven't actually grown all that much either?


Look up what "budget deficit" and "deficit sending" means. A significant portion comes from taxes, but the portion is not enough to cover all expenses. How do you think the country would do with sudden 20% to 30% cuts in EVERYTHING?


Guess what interest rates are doing and are projected to do by those same financial market participants?


By "hostile" I mean that they are buying their products elsewhere. Products being everything from our exports, to our debt and dollars. China is one of our biggest trading partners, and they are starting to look elsewhere.
So, can you answer the question: what happens when the level of borrowing required to sustain this country hits the level at which no one is willing to borrow any more? What happens when those tax receipts are only able to cover interest payments on the debt? What happens when this country is assessed as too risky, and interest rates go up to even a paltry 6%? Or do you believe that debt and government growth can go on indefinitely for centuries, just as house values can go up indefinitely?

Thanks for the info on forks with regards to Proof of Stake. I wasn't sure how that works exactly (specifically, whether it was the same as with bitcoin, and it seems to be yes). Gives me something to think about.


That's my point, they won't have to exclude any coin holders. Only miners. So with bitcoin, the attacker only has hashing power, not coins, and that hashing power can be excluded or neutralized without affecting any of the coins. I don't know what the same scenario would be when the power is the coins themselves.

There are services being worked on (I believe Coinbase is one of them) that let you store money in their "bank" account, and pay in bitcoin with an app, which would right at that point use some of your money to buy bitcoin and transfer it to the merchant instantly. Customers won't even have to think about it, since it will be as easy as Google Wallet or Apple Pay.
As for cash vs credit cards, I think that has more to do with cash just being so extremely inconvenient and lacking in features. You have to stand there and count it, you have no idea what you spent it on unless you record every transaction, and it's dangerous to carry large amounts, because you can lose it or get robbed. Bitcoin doesn't have any of those cash problems.

You don't need to own nodes for it to be decentralized. Satoshi envisioned that eventually there would only be a handful of nodes in the world, and everyone would ve using SPV and other light clients. It's still decentralized, because it's the user wallets that receive, verify, and broadcast transactions. If nodes changed something, no wallet would be able to work with them, and the changed node would just be ignored. All that nodes do is store the history, which is secured by mined hashes. We've been discussing this on bitcointalk forum three years ago.

It won't go down to zero. People aren't going to abandon all their money. So, let's say I create 2% more coin. The value of all coins goes down to 98% due to inflation that I created, and maybe another % due to the initial panic. I wait for the panic to subside (since, again, people won't abandon their money and the systems built to use it), and then of that 2% that I created, spend 1% to buy something. I now have an asset I didn't have before, but still have a 52% majority of the coins, since I gave 1% away and kept 1% for myself. The distribution didn't change basically, and I'm still in complete control. Then, I create another 2% of the coins, and again use 1% to buy more stuff while keeping the other 1%. On and on. People get used to the inflation, and price only decreases due to inflation and not panics, and I can pretty much create money for myself to buy whatever I want indefinitely, as long as I always keep at least half of what I create. This is why central banks and governments can keep getting wealthier, despite inflating the currency they have the most stake in (i.e. they control it and depend on it). Like government, I would be able to buy whatever I want, for as long as I want, as long as I don't inflate the currency I control into hyperinflation. I hope that makes sense.


I don't think so... If Bitcoin is attacked by 51% of ASIC mining power to the point where no other miners can do anything, those other miners are effectively screwed (lost everything), at which point we switch the algorithm to, say, Scrypt, and the attacker is screwed just as much. Mining resumes on other hardware, and everyone's money stays put. If a PoS system is attacked by a 51% owner, I don't know how you can change the algorithm to make that attacker's "proof," which is essentially their money, worthless... Unless the coins he owns can be identified and somehow differentiated, which is why I said "fungible."


Not Intel's. Intel, like AMD and everyone else, typically uses fabs in China to produce their chips, and has their own factories as well. They were working on developing 28nm and pushing it out on their own, but the Chinese ACIS mining developers got that pushed through the Chinese fabs even faster. It was on the news way back in early Spring, though I can't find anything on it any more, sorry.

Telegraph offices where everywhere, and easy to find. Just go to your local post office or Western Union. They were quick and relatively cheap, taking maybe a day, at most two at most to send a message. Radios were more limited and more difficult, but as long as you had one, you could just pick it up and call the person on the other end.
Telephones were specialized, were hard to find, you couldn't call anyone since almost no one had one, while telegraphs could just be delivered to your front door, and if you happened to be lucky enough to find a telephone or owned one, you may not have been able to use it because the operator wasn't working at the time, or the person you were calling wasn't around, and if you did reach them, it cost a fortune to call them, so conversations had to be short, and if over a long distance, they were noisy as hell, with crappy microphones, so you had to yell into them, and probably couldn't understand half the stuff you were hearing. (Thanks to Soviet Union being so economically retarded, we actually had those phones and related problems well into the 1900's).
By the way, the same could be said about most innovative technologies, when they first came out, they were shit compared to established stuff. First digital camera took crappy 320x320 photos onto giant 5" or 10" floppy disks, and took a few seconds of exposure to actually take a picture, while film was easy and had great quality. The first airplanes could barely get off the ground, while dirigibles crisscrossed the globe like luxurious air cruise ships. The first automobiles were unreliable, noisy, coal fed pieces of shit compared to the easy and dependable horse. And the first emails cost tens of dollars to send, and were a major hassle to even get working, with having to buy a "cheap" $2,500 PC, a $300 modem, and expensive email service that you had to be connected to and paying for access while writing your email, which almost no one was able to receive.
It's a good thing people developing those things ignored the stupid trolls who said things like "other more convenient systems already exist."
@_date: 2014-09-01 03:58:50
Completely certain. This is what the core devs, who are working on the system, claim. Mainly because there are already a lot of countermeasures to block 51% attacks, and destroy the pool that attempts them. Those countermeasures are known by large pool operators, which means they know that if they attempt attacks, they will get screwed, which keeps them from attacking, which keeps the priority for adding these measures low. A sort of a [MAD scenario]( where they won't attack because they know we have "nukes," and we don't have to "nuke" them because we know they know we have "nukes."

Stocks don't pay dividends unless the company has no more room to grow, and is forced to give cash earnings back to investors, instead of expanding and continuing to grow its stock value. In the tech sector, a company announcing it will pay dividends is a signal that they can't innovate any more. Just FYI.
Bitcoin produces income the same way that stocks, especially Amex stocks, produce income. Bitcoin is a payment system, which is capturing more market share, innovating and providing better services, and as a result grows in value.
Would you rather have dividend producing stock that pays 5% dividend a year, a non-dividend producing stock that grows in value at 5% a year? The answer is that both are the same.

Has it? The $1200 to $400 was closet to 65% than 90%.
Also, don't forget that bitcoin is getting more resilient and less volatile with time, as all growing free-floating-on-market things do (like stocks), since it takes more and more to move its price. So even though bitcoin crashed from $32 to $0.17 in a span of an hour at one point in its life, that won't ever happen again, since it has more than one exchange to trade on, and much more than $30,000 a day worth of liquidity.

For this to happen they would need money (which they have), time, and resources (which no one does). They would have to either order or crank out an enormous amount of ASICs, and someone would be bound to notice. It would also take them at least a year to build that stock up from scratch, and governments just aren't that focused or disciplined.
Now, let's say they succeed, and manage to get a 51% pool going which starts to mine blocks without any transactions, effectively grinding all transactions to a halt:
This would be noticed quickly, and a patch will come out (with code likely already mostly developed) that will make blocks invalid unless they contain a certain amount of high priority transactions. This means that either their own blocks will be completely ignored, cutting them out completely, or they will be forced to accept other's transactions, making bitcoin work as normal (though under their threat).
Or we can have the top pools form a sort of a trusted cartel, where the pools only accept blocks from the list of mining pools they trust (those being the public ones we have now), and nodes add a quick patch to likewise only accept blocks only from those pools. Again, the attacker is completely cut out from the system. Downside is that this will temporarily centralize all the pools into a single cartel (though the pools are still independent), but the users will no doubt change their nodes back to normal as soon as the threat is gone.
But, let's say the very worse case scenario happened. The attackers are completely relentless, and there is absolutely no way for the other miners to overtake them. At this point, all competing mining pools are considered dead for all practical purposes. Since people don't want to lose their money, the solution is once again fairly trivial: swap the hashing algorithm for something like scrypt that can run on graphics cards (before the days of ASIC). The mining pool ASICs were already dead and useless at that point, and now the government ones are as well, while Bitcoin picks up from the last block that mattered, and keeps on going. Sure it will harm it considerably and will shake its trust, but it won't kill it, and will likely only make it even more resilient to these types of attacks, meanwhile whoever just spent hundreds of billions to attack bitcoin, and failed, is up before congress having to answer for wasting billions in wasted tax payer dollars.
There are other counter-attack scenarios that will make the attacker's investments useless besides just these, and it's the knowledge that we know about these that keeps anyone from actually seriously trying to attack bitcoin.

The illegal part is not reporting the trade in countries where you are required to, **NOT** the actual exchange itself. A shop owner can sell goods for dollars ad not report that as taxable income, but the only illegal thing there would also be the non-reporting, not the sale of goods.
Mycelium is not responsible for whether people follow the law while selling bitcoins, but so far selling bitcoins is not itself illegal.

Hopefully the one who has a background in business and investing that actually matches bitcoin more.
For example, if Gavin Andresen comes here and says "Bitcoin has such and such problem" he will get upvoted, because it will be seen as a a problem that must be warned about and fixed as soon as possible. On the other hand, if someone without a background in technology comes on here (such as Paul Krugman) and says "Bitcoin has such and such problem," he will likely get downvoted, both because of the biases due to him not understanding the technological implications of the system, AND very likely because the claims he made have been made, discussed, and discounted many times before.

Except that companies like BitPay end up buying up millions of dollars of bitcoin every month. A huge chunk of their company assets is in bitcoin. Where do you think those bitcoins people pay with when they pay through BitPay end up going? BitPay makes their money on selling merchant services, investing in bitcoin (though maybe not this year), and selling large blocks of bitcoin on dark markets. They are very much involved. Also, note how many altcoins BitPay supports, or plans to support.


See, that's what I'm talking about. You are only looking at bitcoin the money, but are completely ignoring the much more important bitcoin the technology, with its transaction system and programmable protocol, which a lot of those investments went to support. It's like saying VISA's investment didn't go to support their payment network, because they didn't buy and hold any dollars.
I'm not sure what your point is with regards to fund managers using their own reserves to back shares. None of the fund managers have the bitcoins that are expected to be needed if ETFs take off.

I'd say it's because until bitcoin came along, there was no real need for strong security. There wasn't a way to actually steal money in an unrecoverable way before.


One app, one app, and one thing with very few actual developers. My point isn't that there wasn't a focus on security before, it's that it was relegated to just a very few security nerds doing small independent projects. Bitcoin is the first time that there is an entire protocol with hundreds of developers, all working towards the same security goal, regardless of whether that security it for safely transacting money, or signing contracts, messages, logins, scripts, or whatever.


But they were written, often from scratch, by different people, many of whom have independently found security flaws in the protocol as a whole, or who have come up with different ways to improve security of the system. Bitcoin went from just simple message signing to split keys, multisig, and various ideas for how to keep private keys secure, whether it's paper wallets, BIP38, or dedicated hardware wallets. What's the equivalent for PGP? All PGP apps look and function basically the same...




My point is that the bitcoin ecosystem, wallets and all, is continuously focused on improving private key security. So if some wallet finds a bug in how things are stored, other wallets can improve their own security too, and if some developer finds a way to improve bitcoin key security, such as with multisig, other wallets implement it is well. The whole ecosystem is constantly trying to figure out how to lock down and secure private keys, because losing them is literally losing money, as opposed to just having your identity hacked, and having to let everyone know that this PGP key (or whatever key) has been compromised. That has EVERYTHING to do with Bitcoin, and since BitID uses those same private keys, that so many people are working on securing, it has everything to do with BitID as well. Bitcoin wallets secure and sign transactions using bitcoin keys. You can't send bitcoin without a bitcoin wallet. I don't know how you can say that bitcoin wallets and bitcoin, especially bitcoin wallets and bitcoin development as a whole, are not the same thing.


Again, how many different PGP implementations with different features are there, and how many Android implementations of PGP and SQRL are there, compared to bitcoin wallets? There's 1 SQRL app I could find for Android. BitID is newer, and it has 2 options.


It's not dead, but compared to Bitcoin, at least things like SQRL definitely are.


BitID is going to use HD seeds, meaning it won't reuse keypairs on different sites.




**Ok, so can you please explain to me why BitID, which even references SQRL, decided to implement a different system, instead of just using SQRL with bitcoin private keys?** It makes no sense to me that SO MANY different wallets are using BitID (Schilbach Android Wallet, Mycelium Wallet, DarkWalet, and even BitPay went with their own proprietary thing), instead of using SQRL, when, as you say, SQRL can just be implemented and used in the same way. Why are so many disparate developers deciding that SQRL is not sufficient, and going with BitID for their wallets?


You're probably right, since I'm not a cryptography expert. So, please educate me. Btw, the reason I kept bringing up PGP was because I was under the impression that you would use your same PGP key for SQRL ID and login, like you use your BTC privkey for both sending money and login. I didn't realize that SQRL typically has you create a whole new privkey.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who said this, but Blockchain.info does NOT own your private key. They are a web-based app that runs entirely in your own browser on your own computer, with all your private keys owned solely by you, and not by them. All they do is store an encrypted backup of your keys and wallet. Using Blockchain.info is no different from using something like Bitcoin Core or Electrum, aside from possibly extra bugs that can be introduced from it being run in a browser.

Sure, but hopefully a rational person will also take the opposing view into consideration, and make up his mind based on information presented, not on who is presenting it. But, of course, people aren't very rational :D  Personally, I think that Krugman's statement that "deflationary currencies are bad" really should be considered as "deflationary currencies are bad for specific aspects of government and centrally planned economies." I would also, and ESPECIALLY, take into consideration that bitcoin is not a government issued currency, doesn't care about governments or anyone else, and has a chance of inevitable adoption, so statements like "so and so is bad" are about as useless as saying "when you fall into a fire, you will burn yourself, which is bad," and instead should be replaced with statements like how to we keep from burning ourselves WHEN we fall into the fire, or "Ok, if this is bad, what do we do to mitigate the inevitable?"


When the system you are developing has a specific economic structure, and you support the system, it's kind of expected to defend your system's economic structure. That's how economics get debated: one side presents arguments, and the other presents counterarguments. By the way, I personally am guilty of having tons of economic arguments, and although I am a huge bitcoin supporter, I'm not actually all that technical. I do have degrees in business finance and economics, which were almost exclusively taught from Keynesian/Krugman perspective, but which, upon reading and examining the counterarguments, I still changed my opinion of. Mind you, I didn't reject any of the economic models, functions, math, and theories, I simply apply them in a different way and understand them to be able to lead to different conclusions. We all still believe in Supply/Demand, time-value of money, aggregate demand, and all that other econ stuff. The real debate is only in what are the possible conclusions, and whether the ends justify the means.
Point is, not everyone in is just a techie armchair economist. But I do concede one major point: most of the actual GOOD economics discussions happen on bitcointalk.org, where you can have lengthy, indepth discussions on the subject, instead of Reddit, where the comments are brief, scant, and abandoned with a constant influx of new news.

Bitcoin's specialized hardware mining currently has more power than 500 of the world's super computers combined. All governments would have to build or buy specialized hardware to compete with miners, since their supercomputers will be useless (a cheap specialized ASIC can to 1,600,000,000 mining calculations a second, an expensive 6 core CPU processor can do about 25,000.).
Second, it doesn't matter how much power anyone throws at the system, it will still put out 25 bitcoins roughly every 10 minutes. If too much power is added, the mining difficulty adjusts upward, to keep the flow of new bitcoin steady. So, in your scenario, it still wouldn't take "days" for governments to mine everything. They would mine the majority of coins that get created but it would take them until 2140 to mine everything.

Nice assumption there Sherlock. I sold commissions, where I got paid for actual work, not copies, where I didn't do anything.


I got one better. My grandfather was the head of the Soviet Union's Polytechnical Cybernetics Institute. He was one of the top scientists in USSR. Then he escaped and moved to USA In USA he invented and patented a unique Maglev technology that can be used to make magnetic levitation trains at one tenths the cost of any other Maglev tech out there, and even be used to launch spaceships. My mom, who also moved from USSR to USA, worked for a biotech company, and developed a method for testing lead levels in blood at precision's 30 times better than any previous method, which that company is now using all over USA, Canada, and South America. Both of these inventions were in a capitalist country. Guess what? Neither made them any money.
Just because you invent or create something doesn't automatically entitle you to millions of dollars, or any payment at all. 


That's probably like asking the Mafia wh that they think about police and anti racketeering laws.

Sorry if it came out that way, but it was never my intent. All I ever meant to imply was that we never really had such a push for improved security as when bitcoin came along. 


They have. In fact, a lot of the BIPs were actually proposed, or discovered to be in need of improvement, by wallet developers working together with the core developers, and after many private discussions in various channels, like private IRC channels, Skype, email lists, and other places besides just github, the code was submitted by developers. Just as it's being discussed and collaborated now with BitID. Ever notice how every new Bitcoin Core release announcement has a huge list of "thanks to" that has way more people on it than just core devs? 




Of course it's possible to prevent it. BIP38 encrypt your key, or split it with MultiSig or SSS and if someone steals your paper wallet, they are prevented from stealing your money, where they otherwise wouldn't be. I'm not claiming that bitcoin is making security 100% bulletproof. Again, all I'm saying that security advances in the bitcoin development ecosphere are progressing much faster than in things like SQRL and PGP. More and more preventative and security measures are being implemented for bitcoin key security (even things like [full OS-level GUI virtualization]( which existed for years, disabled, and no one really bothered to develop much until bitcoin gave companies the massive incentive to), while not much of that is being done elsewhere.




Which, again, is strangely absent everywhere else. What other usable cryptography application implements SSS? Most I could find online were a couple enterprise level security apps. Nothing for common users.
And, BTW, "Hardly a new invention" can be said about every core component of Bitcoin, too, but it perfectly demonstrates that just because something was invented, doesn't mean it will be used or adopted, until someone else actually starts working on it. Thus, again my point with regard to SQRL. So what if it's an awesome system, if no one is bothering to do anything with it?


If you are saying that cryptographic development in other things is continuing, and hasn't been completely abandoned, then, uh, sure. I could bring up a point that the sky is usually blue during the day. I don't see the point of bringing up an obvious point. If your point is a counter to my point, that there is more security development currently being done outside of bitcoin, or that there was a faster, or even the same, pace of security development before bitcoin came around, I would have to seriously disagree. My point, that **bitcoin came out and exposed a ton of security problems with the web and computers in general, and by providing the incentive of "stealing a file = stealing money," has GREATLY increased the amount of development around security** has a whole ton of evidence, ranging from innovative wallets, to hardware, to crazy things like paper wallets, to things like tons of software patches to security holes in apps and operating systems that were thought to be unimportant, or weren't known about before.


Why not? Why wouldn't an average Joe be interested in keeping his identity safe online, or keeping his files safe and secure? Is security something that only certain class of people deserve to have access to? Why is it that only bitcoin is trying to design all that security to be usable by the average Joe, but all those other useful things are designed to be used by techie nerds?


If implementation is complete, why is it not implemented anywhere? Why is the software choice so limited, and limited in features? (I can't even use more than one ID in most of these implementations). Bitcoin transaction signing and propagation was complete in 2010. Why are core devs, software devs, and hardware engineers still developing stuff? Frankly, same could be said for a whole lot of things: why do people keep making new standards, when old standards already exist?


You keep saying this, but excuse me if I don't just take your word for it. Why is it insecure if, at its core, it does practically the exact same thing?


I could just as well ask why would they bother implementing SQRL, if, as you said, SQRL is already finished and can be used elsewhere with its own apps? 


The things BitID has to do with bitcoin is it can use similar methods that SQRL uses, but use the same crypto functions and libraries that everyone's bitcoin wallets already have, including all the features those wallets use to manage keys and improve security. As I said before, its a simple implementation, that gives you the same level of security as SQRL, but is easier to implement in software tools that already do most of the stuff SQRL requires. And as you mentioned, why reinvent the wheel and stick something different like SQRL into your bitcoin wallet, if you can just use most of the things your wallet uses already?

Cyprus was the cause, in that the events there scared the hell out of other European countries who are in similar situation, specifically Spain, and there was a massive increase in wallet downloads and purchases into Bitcoin all over Europe. Even if Cyrpiots weren't the ones initially investing, though quite a few were, that event was still the catalyst that spiked it to $266.

Regulations caused him to lose $5,000,000, then another $2,000,000 (when the FBI confiscated it), so that's a start.
Then regulations prevented any other US-based exchange from starting up to compete with him. We had Bitfloor, which died because of regulations, and Tradehill, which also died from regulations, in both cases the exchanges lost their banks due to regulatory issues. As a result, MtGox was the only available exchange for most people in the world, until Bitstamp finally started working in Europe.
If it wasn't for regulations, MtGox would not have lost $7,000,000 and might still have been liquid, but more importantly, MtGox would have had at least 2 very good competitors, would have have had as many growing pains since other exchanges would have taken on some of that growth, and it would not have grown as much, since it would not have been the only choice out there for 2.5 years.
So, yes, regulations caused the whole MtGox fiasco.

The most competent individuals have likely not lost much in bitcoin. They would have "only put in whatever they are willing to lose," is is repeated here over and over, spent more time on actually developing and expanding the system instead of just investing in it, and understood that bitcoin investing is a very long game. It's pretty stupid (actually downright fucking retarded) that you guys only use the $1,200 and $500 as the price points that bitcoin has ever existed at. I doubt many people bought at $1,200.

In both the BitID page, AND the very first BitID proposal on bitcointalk ( SQRL was mentioned as a similar proposal, with references by developers to it as their inspiration, or "prior art." So obviously they knew about it.


That's true, the best I saw was "Yes, as stated into the document SQRL is "prior art" but it is not suited for usage as is." 


From what I understand, BitID implements the already established bitcoin key message signing "standard." We have bitcoin keys signing transaction messages, then expanded it to signing messages to prove you own the address, and now to proving identity for login purposes. To me it's just one following the other, using the same basic function, which is to sign a message. So, unless you can use a bitcoin private key to sign a SQRL login...

I don't know, but probably every phone manufactured in the last year. I've seen some CHEAP $25 ones on Amazon that still run Android 4.4, so maybe even those.
But the point is not to have two separate devices, one being your personal phone, and second being a secure storage phone that you keep securely stashed away. Instead the point here is to have your own daily use phone, with a small amount of daily use bitcoins, AND a secure stash inside that same phone on that TEE as your secure storage, all on the same device. After all, as long as you have a backup somewhere (encrypted, or split into M-of-N parts), and your phone is encrypted, losing your phone won't be a problem, and having it hacked won't be an issue. So you could literally walk around with your life savings in your pocket (though, admittedly, I would still be too paranoid to do that).

Hmm... never thought about that. But yes, some level of physical security is advised, just like you would use for your paper wallet printouts. At least to make sure that your device isn't replaced with a compromised one, too. But it really depends on your level of security concern. If you don't think you will have anyone break into your house and do that, then probably no. If you are extremely concerned about security and storing thousands of coins, maybe, but you can also just reflash new firmware to make sure it's legit, add a brand new Diceware seed, and bring a wallet with entropy verification just to be sure. And make sure you use an old printer that doesn't connect to anything. That should be pretty much 100% secure then.

There is not enough computing power on these things to do encryption. So we recommend printing on printers that don't have internal storage. Memory is ok, since it gets wiped as soon as you turn it off.

* Buying the cheapest insurance in general, if they think they most likely won't need it
* Not paying for signature verification and tracking when shipping a package, hoping it will get there anyway
* Buying non refundable plane and hotel tickets, assuming they will be able to travel at the time

I'm not sure how a mutated transaction can interfere with the original propagated one. If the original one is broadcast, and 90% of the network hears it, then someone changes the tx ID and the network hears that too, the money will still end up going to the designated address, no? The worst that could happen is the transaction gets intercepted and mutated, and the Transaction Confidence, not seeing is own transaction in the network, will get stuck at 0%, forcing he traders to wait for a block.

From the user on Bitcointalk.com




convertible virtual currency in exchange for currency of legal tender or another convertible virtual currency for any reason (including when intermediating be tween a user and a seller of goods or services the user is purchasing on the user’s behalf) is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person. The guidance also makes clear that “a user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations.” 
This would be rather concerning if true

Should something so drastic actually happen, way before that happens we'll likely abandon the current hashing algorithm, and fork Bitcoin into something that makes GHash's mining hardware useless (Scrypt? POS?) That this is a virtual guarantee, means that a rational actor like GHas wouldn't even bother with such an attack. An irrational one might, but they'll just be throwing away their money in the end.


Would they prevent other miners from joining their mini-pools? If not, then all the miners will continue to be able to mine. Sure, all the competing pools will be killed, but miners will keep mining and earning rewards together with whoever owns the 51%+ of the hashing power. Though I can't see how this scenario would cause any harm, since from the network's and other miner's point of view everything will be operating as normal.

I will take your word for it and use design flaw from now on




Incredibly stupid. From G Maxwell 


I don't think they ever lost control of their private key. With weekly, monthly, or quarterly financial reviews, as I said, if the theft happened quickly, even if over a months, such a review may still not have helped in time. That said, me being a financial analyst, I am quite dismayed at the last of finance and accounting people involved in exchanges who would be able to track things like this. At the very least, MtGox should have had automated software that compared their software accounting balance with their Bitcoin wallet balance, and froze the system as soon as it was some % out of sync (small % discrepancies could be due to timing issues)


Sorry, you're right.


I must have missed that. I'll have to reread it. What's your opinion on that document's authenticity?


Ah, I see what you mean. While I agree somewhat (see my comments above), I don't think we know whether this theft was happening over the course of a few years, or just recently.  If over a long time, then financial audits would have found a discrepancy.
Perhaps I should change my statement from "regulations would not have prevented this theft" to "regulations may not have helped, and are not needed if users demand that exchanges self-regulate."


I'm sorry, it's been a rather stressful last few days, with lots of interactions with trolls and commenters who don't understand Bitcoin, having to explain this situation and it's impacts on a ton of news sites. I seriously doubt i would do more harm than good, but I guess what I should have said, "if you are more knowledgeable, can I use you as a reference to ask things and learn from?" Actually, I don't really know who you are, so I would still take your suggestions with a grain of salt... But, what is your opinion on comparing transaction malleability to changing the check # on a payment you received, depositing the check, receiving the money, complaining that you never got paid, and when the company downloads their list of transactions from their bank and sees that that check # is missing, issues a new check?

You were talking about insurance. I pointed out that insurance is not flawless, and risk miscalculations are done.

I can hold them all entirely on my own computers/phones, and still spend them digitally on the web without needing to deposit them into an insured bank. So if a crash like 2008:happens again, and bitcoin is more adopted, rather than crashing, it will likely be considered a safe haven for the money to run to.

Oh yeah, one security problem not solved: Let's say you and I want to make a deal, and we want to have a trusted third party in control of the money as an arbitrator, but without any chance of him running away with any of it (such as on OpenBazaar, where such deals may even be anonymous soon).

Yes, it's possible


Evil statists haven't been able to prevent banks from embezzling either. So a better answer is, because this exchange did not use proof-of-reserves that many other exchanges now use to cryptographically prove that 100% of your bitcoins are on their system, or multi-signature accounts that don't let them run with their coins unless you countersign on the transaction letting them take it. MUCH more effective, and way cheaper, than "evil statist regulations"

Absolutely. There is no good reason for all people to own the house they live in.




If car loans are 4% now, and deflation is 3%, car loans will just have to be at 7%. Not much of an increase, and if you calculate all the interest payments, short term loans are exponentially less affected by interest than long term. For example, on a $10,000 loan at 7%, you will pay $1,880 in interest if it's a 5 year loan, and $13,950 in interest if it's a 30 year loan. I'm a financial analyst, so dealing with loans and calculating exact numbers for these things is my job.


Don't put the cart before the horse. The US has poor public transportation **because** everyone wants their own home and government creates a massive incentive for it (tax deductible mortgage interest for example). NOT US has poor public transportation, and that's why everyone buys houses far apart.


Cancer greatly stimulates growth too. You don't want growth for growth's sake. You want growth at the natural rate of economic development, backed by actual growth and assets, not fake rapid economic growth, based on loans and promises of repayment in the future. You don't want to get into a situation where such promises end up getting pushed further and further perpetually into the future as they get bigger and bigger, because the end result is always realization that they can't be paid, followed by default, followed by collapse.

And for now we would rather focus our development on things like HD wallets and CoinJoin. It's not that we are trying to cut off our nose, it's just that we don't have that many developers or resources for us to be worth it.
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:05:01
That would require BIP32 HD wallets, since generating new addresses is dangerous without backups. This will likely be out next major feature, and is a prerequisite to CoinJoin, which also requires different change addresses.

That is not the case in all jurisdictions, and BFL has sent out tons of refunds, despite their policy against them. So... again, how have they stolen? Stealing is taking something without permission, or without giving something back despite promising to. Have they taken anyone's money against their will? Have they kept someone's money without giving them a product? I'd like to know, especially with regards to the later part. They claim they have caught up with their backlog, so if there is still someone who paid a while ago, who has not received their device, I need to know about it.

As the owner of the biggest bitcoin discussion board, it stands to reason that he would be one of the first people notified should a major bitcoin bug be found, and then it would be his responsibility to send the alert, which will be received mainly by bitcoin core devs, bitcoin wallet devs, exchanges, and others running the core client.

Sometimes DarkWallet can't establish a connection to their servers. It needs to connect to gateway server and obelisk. Obelisk is the one that keeps track of addresses, transactions, and balances, ad has been known to go down once in a while. So until obelisk is back, you won't see any transactions.
You can verify whether the transaction was seen by the network by checking your bitcoin address on blockchain.info

Exchanges don't regularly run away with customer funds either, because both 1 and 2. So far there was Neo &amp; Bee, and that one in China I can't remember the name of (MtGox is still unknown whether it was all embezzlement, all incompetence, or a combination of both). Out of the 50+ exchanges out there, that's not too bad, and new cryptographic security technologies are going to make running away difficult to impossible without even any expensive oversight.

Mycelium is currently working on HD (no address reuse) and hopefully will have it ready some time this Summer (though we may get delayed, as usually happens with software projects).

Buttcoin actually lists actual challenges bitcoin actually faces? I find that rather surprising, and improbable. I mean, let's pretend you just found today, and were concerned about the echo chamber. Let's see what has to say to help you feel more confident about this investment:
* Merchant: "Sorry I accidentally robbed you"
* A Leader "gives" over "20$" then whines about no-one collecting his "0.09$" tips
* CONFESSIONS OF BUTTCOIN: Butt of Darkness: Part One: The Phantom Butt
* Butt enthusiast doggedly traipses around his city trying to spend his butts, surprisingly encounters obstacles and frustrations with flaky buttcoin machines. They should consider using Butterfly Labs for their hardware needs. Rock solid reliability at reasonable prices.
* Bitcoiners genuinely surprised that people working for BoE are technically minded and are able to critically assess.
* I know you're here. I can feel you now.
* [COMEDY PYRITE] Artisanal bit/butt related subreddit of the day
* The nice thing about using Future Money(TM) is that it's so easy to fix when things go wrong.
* Butters rush into a regional subreddit they've never contributed to in order to DEFEND THE BUTTS!
* Butters rejoice that Wil Wheaton has no idea what Bitcoin is
* Decided to stay on a sinking ship? Pump all the way down! See you in the bilge next year.
* The chart the bitcoin cult does not want anyone seeing.
As a fellow investor, I must say that none of these really instill any confidence in me, or even interest me as something to seriously consider, with their rather childish and, dare I say, asinine, references to asses.
Though I do admit, I felt like posting a reply to the last one on that list, here  to answer yet another old-but-still-often-brought-up bitcoin non-issue, which, like many others, get brought up over and over, get explained away over and over, and then get complained about for being ignored, over and over.

Not true. I can borrow $100 from you by giving you a $10 downpayment and promising to repay the rest. I can then spend that money on consumables, like vacation or food, and you can then trade that $100 IOU with someone else, using it as money. But now that $100  is backed entirely by my promises to repay, since the initial money that I was received is completely gone. In the end, I get a little bit of prosperity, and whoever converted that IOU into money is trading with something backed by my promises. This is why I consider our last century's prosperity to be entirely built on promises and wishes, with much of the wealth dependent on future generations repaying the debt, and why the financial system briefly collapsed in 2008 when the unbacked IOUs on mortgages were exposed for what they were.


The point of banking is (and historically was) to keep your money safe while still being able to spend it. When people traveled through middle east around the time of Crusades, they didn't want to risk being robbed of their gold, but still wanted to be able to spend their money when they reached their destinations. And thus, the new idea of "bank" replaced the old idea of "safe." This is also a big reason why people put money into banks today, and will put bitcoin into banks in the future: they want someone else to handle security for them, while still being able to pay for bills and things at the store.


On the contrary, without the central bank, in a credit crunch the financial market will decide that liquidity is not a good thing to have, and contract to the levels it needs to be at. Liquidity, economic expansion, and risk are intertwined. Say we all used water to represent our wealth, and our lives and machines depended on it. Then the economy expanded way too fast, and we started to run out of water, without which we, and our farms, would die of thirst. We would have a water "crunch," where water use would become more expensive, and reduce our wasting of it. Now, what would happen if a central bank came out and created a whole bunch of water-backed certificates, which didn't have water backing them, and dumped those on the market? The water shortage would be covered up, and we would keep using up water until we reach a critical point, where there isn't enough water for us to drink. Replace "water" with "productive economic resources" and you get the same effect: we are wasting our economic resources (which include labor and intellectual capital), without realizing that we are exhausting them. And we are doing it in a MUCH riskier fashion than we would have if we didn't have a central bank covering up the risk. Fact is, without a central bank, we wouldn't have major credit crunches. When things get too risky and credit becomes expensive, people would stop borrowing until money reaches a new balance. Unlike in the current system where every credit crunch is covered up and risk is allowed to expand until we have MASSIVE crunches that we can't cover up or control.


That's true, but in an inflationary economy, that return is **anything over -2%.** So it's more profitable to throw money at garbage, than to just keep the money. Increasing the amount of money banks have does both, make investments profitable even if their return is negative, and gives banks money to throw at these investments.




"You" and "We" are not the banks doing the lending. So that "someone" in your example is the banks.


Pick one item and claim that since it hasn't risen in price, there is no inflation? Really?  You wouldn't be claiming something that silly, would you? Have you checked the price of smartphones recently? Oh no! We are in a massive deflation!!! That's stupid of course. Yes, shadow stats, and the fact that break, milk, beef, clothing, hotels, apartments, airline tickets, and many other consumables are quite a bit more expensive than they were just 10 years ago. They should be at most 1.3 times more expensive, but most are 1.5 to 2.5 times more.

It **wasn't** but it **is** now, with cryptographic proof of reserve, where you can independently mathematically verify that all your bitcoins are actually on their servers, and with multisignature accounts, where spending (or stealing) your bitcoins can only be done with the bank's AND your consent together. So, bad stuff happened, bitcoin itself evolved to fix it. Bad stuff happens with regular currency, it still remains regular currency. We just try to figure out how to protect the servers it's stored on better.

By far not everyone.

Do you understand the difference between holding cash and losing cash by putting it into a skeezy investment or giving it to a questionable business to hold? I hope you don't think that EVERYTHING you put your money into is FDIC insured O.o You do know that people lose dollars in scams, scam investments, and sketchy businesses, too, right? And that things like MtGox were not a bank? So you can't really compare the two. Nor have their failure made bitcoin any less secure. Not any more than Bernie Madoff has made your dollars less secure. On the contrary, now people know what to avoid, and more security tools are being developed to keep that from happening again. Without government being involved.
I don't know how long ago you started following Bitcoin, but a year and a half ago, the community was rife with things called High Yield Investments Plans (HYIPs). "Businesses" were starting up, promising that if you deposit money with them, they will relend the money or otherwise invest it somehow, paying you interest. This interest was ridiculously high, something like 3% to 6% **a week**. Not surprisingly, many of them turned out to be ponzi schemes. The most famous one was BTC Savings and Trust run by a guy with a username Pirate They collapsed, a bunch of people lost money, and then... Nothing. There's no regulation in bitcoin banning ponzi schemes. Government didn't step in to pass laws making bitcoin HYIPs illegal. Anyone is as free to start one now as they were two years ago. But they don't exist any more. Simply because people learned their lesson, are being more responsible and less dependent on thinking some entity somewhere will protect our insure them if they do something stupid or don't do their due diligence before giving up their money. Same thing will happen with the Gox case.

I think that has yet to be decided in court. The value itself isn't actually evidence, after all. They still have the evidence that the value was there at the point they confiscated it. And it's not illegal to possess money. So this is probably closer to them confiscating a blank check, and you canceling that check number to make sure it's not abused.

From: Sam Patterson
Thanks for the idea! This is something we’ve looked at, and you can read about it in this paper on the trust system we’re building. Here’s the relevant section:
In a proof-to-miner scheme, the payment to create trust for an identity is paid to the miner that first confirms the bitcoin transaction which is the proof. This scheme initially seems desirable, as there is no single entity which can be compromised, and it incentivizes the network to mine more, thereby making bitcoin more secure and, in turn, OpenBazaar more secure.
Technically, proof-to-miner can be achieved by including an OP_TRUE in the output script of the transaction. While anyone is, in principle, able to spend the output of the given transaction, a miner is incentivized to only include their own spending in their confirmation. Alternatively, a 0-output bitcoin transaction can be made, so that all the inputs are given to the next miner as fees. Again it is important to include the GUID of the OpenBazaar identity in the transaction.
Unfortunately, it is again possible to game this system. This attack would work as follows: The malicious agent first generates a new OpenBazaar identity. Subsequently, they make a proof-to-miner bitcoin transaction with any amount they desire, but they keep the transaction secret. They then perform regular bitcoin mining as usual, but include their secret proof-to-miner transaction in their block confirmation. Including an additional transaction does not increase the cost of mining; therefore this approach can be employed by existing rational miners. If they succeed in generating a block, they publish the secret transaction and they gain identity trust in the OpenBazaar network, and can use the money again in the same scheme to increase their trust arbitrarily. If they do not succeed in generating a block, they keep the transaction secret and double-spend the money in a future transaction in the same scheme, until they are able to generate a block.

Nope, not "AND." Either/Or. If supply of gasoline goes up but demand is fixed, gas prices fall. If supply of gasoline is fixed but demand goes dows, gas prices fall. Hell, even if the supply goes up AND demand goes up, prices can still fall if the supply increases faster than the demand. They are curves on a graph that can move around, and it's their interrelation, and where they cross, that determines price. These curves also have different slopes, denoting how much the demand changes based on price, called elasticity of demand/supply. For example, gasoline demand is very inelastic (its curve is almost horizontal): people will demand it and pay for it regardless of price, because they need it to get to work. On the other hand, items with many alternatives have very elastic demand, since an increase in their price will just make people buy the alternatives. This curve, or slope, in demand is why I could have the demand be fixed to simplify my example, and still have it work.
 Please read this  


In economics terms, monetary inflation is literally an increase in the money supply, and deflation is the decrease. Colloquially, inflation and deflation is used to just describe rising and falling prices. I tend to use colloquial terms, just because it's easier, and because almost always the reasons for rising or falling prices in the economy as a whole (not individual items) are due to charge in the money supply.




Based on your earlier comments, I thought you didn't understand basic economic concepts, so I was trying to dumb things down for you to help make my explanations easier. But if you understand the concepts and the terms, then my mistake. Although then I don't know why you wouldn't understand why a contracting economy would NOT lead to falling prices.
Who is your economist source BTW?

It may be related to bitcoin because one of bitcoin's goals is to give financial access to the very same people Overstock is helping sell their products. For Bitcoin. If we manage to get enough exchanges and ATMs into those countries that those people can actually use bitcoin as their bank account (or at least as their means of accepting payment and converting it to their own currency), then the cycle of artists selling for bitcoin through Overstock, and customers buying stuff from Overstock with bitcoin which goes back to those artists, will be complete.

You could import it into an offline device and have that sign it before taking the signed file to an online device. That is even more secure than the Trezor. Using Cold Storage spending from Mycelium Wallet on a non-rooted phone is almost as good, since the private key is only loaded into protected memory for a few seconds.
The future, though, is protected execution layer that is included in every new Android CPU, but not enabled due to lack of drivers and support. Rivetz is working on making that accessible. Once that is available, Android wallets will be able to keep private keys and signing in a completely separate part of the CPU, making them as secure as Trezor (meaning Mycelium has a chance of being as secure as Trezor in a year or so too.)

That bumping off is quite a serious case. Hopefully people don't keep such large amounts on their spending wallets. Look into Rivetz.com for another security feature we plan to implement soon. That likely won't have pin resets, but will be a lot more harsh for lost passwords.
The database is encrypted. I think we got rid of our ability to restore user's coins once we added the pin reset option.
Yeah, we have internal struggles about backing up on setup vs letting people use the wallet right away. Convenience vs trying to out invent "a better idiot." For now, convenience is still winning out. Once Rivetz's system is implemented, we may end up with both, no mandatory password on setup, and mandatory password in secure hardware-locked account.
And no, we love criticism and feedback. Its what helps us figure out what to improve, and keeps the number of to do items on our list so high :)

I think part of the problem is that Bitcoin was invented by computer nerds, and was thus explained by computer nerds first, who tended to use technical terms that no one but them really understood. Kind of typical of any advanced new technology. I don't generally see any simple explanations of how bitcoin works, and until recently many of them started with explaining how mining works X(


For this one I tell them because you yourself have all the information for everything in the system, and can check and verify it personally. Or rather the program you are using does automatically. So instead of having to trust a third party, like government, you only have to trust yourself and your own records (thus, please practice safe computing, or wait a bit until we have devices that can make that easier).

I wholeheartedly agree with Daniel on that point, but I'm not sure it's possible to implement something like Maidsafe using bitcoin. The system depends on rewarding contributors with a token, meaning it has to have its own built-in inflation mechanism, and that just can't be done with bitcoin. So my guess is that Maidsafe appcoins will be worth about as much as it actually costs to rent storage space on the Maidsafe system, even if everyone constantly sells Maidsafe coins, and only buys them as a method of being able to pay the system rent.

Mmycelium stores a searchable database format of the blockchain file on it's own servers. Your phone pols those servers for address balances. Regarding your concern, you can install Orbot (Tor) on your android phone, and Mycelium wallet supports adding a Tor proxy (no need to root), which will make those inquiries encrypted and completely anonymous. We figured, instead of trying to do the private, encrypted, and anonymous thing ourselves, that it's best to leave it to the experts.

Bitcoin to financial systems is like internet to telephone landlines. One is completely proprietary, locked and controlled by a few monopolies, doesn't allow innovation except with permission, licenses, and lots of money, and for almost a century had only innovations on the edges (answering machines and cordless phones for one, Square and PayPal for the other). The other is completely open and unrestricted, that anyone can jump into and innovate, both at the edges (smartphones / BitPay) and in the system itself (Skype / Multi-signature Transactions).
So, in short, bitcoin, like the internet, is great because its level of innovation is exponentially faster than that of the old restrictive systems.
@_date: 2014-09-05 13:23:25


You can? Won't you need to open a business account that stores other people's money for them? And make sure they all use PayPal? And charge 3% + $0.30 per tip? And limit this to US users on what is obviously a global group? 
Micro transaction streams let you use the bitcoin system to send over 100 transactions of fractions of a penny a second, in a way that doesn't let the payer take off with the money or claim they didn't intend to pay. Since bitcoin allows devices to store and transfer money, you can set your wireless router to ask for payment from whatever device connects to it, the connecting device can establish a micro transaction channel, and then pay for every 1kb of data it receives. In a mesh network, the main barrier to adoption is "Why should I give away my internet for free when I'm paying for it?" With a mesh network that uses such micro transaction stream routers, your and your neighbor's routers would both establish streams, and charge each other for data used. If you both share equally, the transactions are a wash, with you owing the same as you earned, and it doesn't cost anything. If one of you ends up using more bandwidth from the other, you will have to pay extra, so there is an incentive to provide better and faster connection to your neighbors. If someone wants to use the web for free, they end up having to pay, and with such streams the network load balances and everyone involved earns money (you send them web content, earn money, but if your connection is overwhelmed, you use those same earnings to buy a bit more bandwidth from your neighbors). No, VISA can't do that. For one, you don't want to give your VISA account info to every random stranger in your neighborhood. Visa also can't charge or transfer such small amounts, or handle as many transactions, since with micro transaction streams the actual transactions are done off blockchain, and only get broadcast when the web user is finished using it.

BitID completely replaces login username and password. It works by having the website give you a random text challenge string, you signing it with your bitcoin address private key, just like you sign bitcoin transactions, and that signed string is sent right back to the website. The site only has to store your public bitcoin address, and you only send back a signed message, so the site being hacked, or someone snooping on your connection, doesn't pose any risks. Unlike with passwords, where those can get stolen.

No, this just signs your own text the same way it signs transactions. Using this you can prove that you own an address without using it to send anything. If I wanted proof that you own it, I would send you some text, like "sign this text blah blah bork," you would sign it with your bitcoin address private key, and I would be able to verify that the signature is valid, and thus you really do own the address, using blockchain.info or Bitcoin-QT.

Some of those run their own nodes (on this graph those would be the Unknowns  but many, if not most, of those data centers still point their miners at pools, too. It's very easy to set up mining software to automatically fail over to another pool if the one you are using loses connection (I think the most popular one supports 5?), and leave the pool running business to pool professionals. Especially since at this point, bitcoind can't actually handle the data required to do mining (terahashes of data per second?), so you pretty much have to run custom software. Plus it saves money on not having to power and cool yet another server.

The initial transaction will not be low priority no-fee transaction, since it's passed directly to the merchant to verify, and the merchant will reject it unless it's completely valid and paid for.
The double spend transaction will be sent from a device that is connected directly to the pool nodes. There is no need to worry about 90% of the nodes rejecting it.
There are pools out there who will happily take your new 0.0002 fee transaction, and throw away your old 0.0001 transaction. They have an incentive to accept the higher fee. If they were paid to only accept the signed transaction, they have an incentive to continue to provide security against double spends.
So the entire point here isn't about nodes propagating it, but that it gets to the actual miners directly who are responsible for including it in a block.

Also, I am a financial analyst and accountant. Audits don't take a week. With an automated accounting system (which I imagine MtGox had, as opposed to papers and Excel) it takes maybe a day.

Bitcoin is only going to double in the amount, so the most that can happen is their percentage holdings of bitcoin going from, say, 1% now to 0.5% 140 years from now. However, the % of bitcoins on exchanges will probably decrease as its price increases. Used to be exchanges would move $10mil a day, which comprised of about 1,000,000 bitcoins ($10BTC/USD). Now they are moving $50mil a day, which comprises of 50,000 bitcoins ($1,000BTC/USD). So the Fed having a large chunk to dispose oof on an ever decreasing liquidity market (liquidity based on number of coins, not value of coins) may not be good.

That would mean everyone who retires at 65 with an IRA or 401k has "banking wealth," which just renders the ominous connotation of that term completely meaningless.


That, again, sounds way more ominous than it is. Exploiting profitable ventures is nothing more than investing and earning money from things other people really want to pay for. Everyone should be "exploiting" profitable ventures, even if that means investing $25 a month in the stock market and letting that money work for you.
this, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the actual "evil banking" which doesn't invest in (or "exploit") profitable ventures, but rather exploits people through monopoly power, or by praying on desperation from those who don't know any better. Note, for instance, that Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars (WAAAAAY more than Matthew Mellon from this article) is extremely hated in Wall Street and banking sector, and really hates banks himself.


Uh, there is no distinction, or rather no such thing as "labourers" in the  terms that you are trying to define them in. One is a capitalist with materials and skills resources (the person who has money and/or factory, and the skills to run and operate them), and the other is also a capitalist with materials and skills resources (personal tools and equipment, and knowledge of how to put the investor's money and/or factories to use). Really the only difference is in how rare, and thus valuable, each person's contribution is. Typically "labourer" skills are very abundant in the market, or are easy to learn, while the investor's are very specialized and are learned from years of experience.

2008 was the year of Arab Spring protests, and governments shutting down internet and cell phone access. The original device idea was going to provide its own mesh network and could be charged by solar. It would allow texting in areas without any infrastructure support whatsoever, allowing protesters to organize, or people in very poor and remote parts of the world to communicate. Now the goal is to be able to use bitcoin very easily, on a cheap secure device, and without the need for a data connection. So it's useful for regular users who don't want to store bitcoins on their phones and just use a card to pay with, users who don't have a data connection, travelers who are outside of their cell plan area, and we could drop a box of these on some remote village in the middle of Africa or India, and as long as one person has a cell phone connected to the blockchain, everyone in the village can use bitcoin.

Day trading doesn't set the price. Price is set by the ratio of buyers to sellers. Day trading involves buying and selling constantly, so it's a wash for the price. All it does is increase liquidity and decrease volatility. Plus if that's what they are doing, then they wouldnt care about the price, since they make money on volatility, not long term investment. Meaning they would have no reason to lose interest simply from bitcoin value going down. As long as bitcoin price moves, they should keep day trading.


And despite that the price went from $100 to $1,200. Imagine if they actually started using it for payments.


That bitcoin price is still unstable, because it's used for speculation? Can you guess what bitcoin price was like, and what it was used for about a year or two ago, before things like Gyft and BitPay existed? I didn't even realize that this was something that anyone was trying to get others to ignore. I figured it was an assumed fact.
No, not Roger Ver. I rarely see him at conferences.

Those companies may come up with bitcoin businesses and innovations we may actually want to pay for!


Hah! That's nothing! It dropped 92% back in 2011.


Because it is an excellent and very unique hedge against other assets, it doesn't follow the rest of the stocks and economy, making it smooth out their portfolio volatility, because it's trend is up over long term and not down, because the fundamentals of it have greatly improved over the last year, and because the same potential for it is still there. Sure, some investors won't invest in it, just as funds avoided internet stocks like Amazon, which was a total looser, after the dot.com crash, but others who understand it will. Your whole problem is that you are looking at bitcoin as if it is a token of value that exists in a vacuum, does nothing but have value, has lost value recently, and is just traded by a bunch of people in China. You are missing about 90% of what gives bitcoin value. I'm sure you know all the new technology it enables, like multisignature escrows, micro payments, microtransaction channels, asset registry, etc. But if you still don't get it, I can't help you. You'll just come around to it yourself eventually.

Satoshi worked with Gavin and at least two other developers for a while. I think Gavin worked with him almost from the beginning. Satoshi disappeared around the end of 2010, so was working together with the team for about two years. Some of the developers don't support the same cypherpunk views that the rest of developers do. Gavin generally avoids all politics all together. But they still support deflationary money, and hope that bitcoin replaces government money some day. Which is pretty libertarian, I guess.


So far it has, and has performed as expected. Including risk of 51% scenarios, where twice we approached it, and twice the mining concentration was scaled back. There is no reason for miners not to continue mining it as long as bitcoin has value, so there is no risk of them stopping, and no issues with motivation. Plenty of well known cryptographers have looked into how to hack or break it, and gave their approval as well. So it has all been done, tested, discussed, and planned for. At this point, as Gavin says, there are unlikely to be any surprise bugs left in the code. Most risk would come from bugs introduced from new features.

Last time I read my bank contracts (which admittedly was a while ago), it said issues of money stolen using your debit card will not be reimbursed (or only reimbursed up to $200 or something). Credit card thefts reimburse you, because credit card companies like Visa/MasterCard actually handle the money, while debit cards are handled directly by banks, so they didn't used to reimburse that theft. Maybe that changed.

This money doesn't just come out of thin air. It's a rebate on the huge fees charged to the merchant, so merchants have to raise their price to cover it. In other words, regardless of whether your card gets you 3-5% cash back, you have to pay higher prices to cover people who do get that option, and getting that option yourself just means you are getting your own money (which was overcharged to the merchant) back.


Direct liability, yes, but same as above, money doesn't come out of thin air. Most of the time the liability is forced on the merchants instead of the credit cards. Your credit card gets stolen, you are given your money back, the merchant gets issued a chargeback (money taken back from their account, plus fee), and merchants have little to no recourse to do anything about it. Chargebacks about for approximately 3% of losses annually for merchants, so to compensate, they raise their prices by 3% too. So, although you don't seem to have any liability if your card is stolen, you are still paying approximately 3% higher prices to pay for that liability yourself, regardless of how safe you are with your cards.


If you are doing large purchases, such as $25k for a car, chance are the store will want something more concrete, like a wire transfer than a credit card, too. Plus the 10 minute thing is misunderstood. If you swipe your credit card or send a bitcoin transaction, the money shows up instantly. But the money becomes yours and spendable within 10 minutes to an hour with bitcoin, while the same takes 2 days to 2 weeks with credit cards.


You forget that there are many countries out there whose currencies are already becoming worthless (Argentina, Venezuela, Iran, etc. Look up inflationary currencies in Wiki). Plus, even if the dollar stays stable, USD &lt;&gt; BTC &lt;&gt; USD transactions, where Bitcoin is just used as a money transfer system, is still cheaper and more reliable than any other money transfer systems we have available. Bitcoin is also the only money system we have that is programmable and can do things like contracts automatically.

Durability in the case of money refers to how well it can stand up to its environment. For example, fish can be used to trade, but it's not durable, because it can quickly spoil. Gold, fiat, and crypto are durable, because they can sit for a long time and retain their structure. I guess here fiat is a bit less durable not because it's sometimes printed on paper, but because the underlying authority issuing it can screw up and have it fail or drop in price.

Your bitcoin isn't stuck anywhere. It's global. You just have to have access to the key to spend it, which you can save on your phones, computers, or online sites. Not much different from having a login and password to be able to log into and spend money from your bank.
By the way, you got the "even worse" wrong. I'd rather have my money stuck on a piece of paper I have with me, than stuck in some bank somewhere. People want a money system that works.

What would they buy more of with cash, if the economy is not growing? Economy would have to keep growing, otherwise the bitcoins will be growing faster than the economy (or, said otherwise, the economy would be shrinking compared to bitcoin), and bitcoin value would decrease, as if it was inflationary. The economic growth rate would just find a new equilibrium. Plus there would definitely still be economic growth. Long term average growth rate of the S&amp;P500 is 12% a year. Take off 3% inflation, and you still have 9% growth, aka return on business investment. Asked whether to hold deflationary bitcoins for a 3% return (estimated) or a 9% return from a business investment, I'm sure many investors would still like the 9% more.

Why are Euros, or Argentinian Pesos, not a competitor to the US dollar? Why aren't copper or aluminum a competitor to gold? Those reasons are the same for why an alt coin isn't an inflation or competition to bitcoin.
The reason PayPal, Google, or anyone else has not created a competing altcoin is because one of Bitcoin's biggest "killer features" is it being decentralized in a way that it doesn't depend on anyone. You can use it and trust that it will work and not go away, without needing to trust some company or entity to continue to issue and support it. If an entity like PayPal were to co e out with an alternative, either they would have to have it set up to mined in a decentralized fashion, at which point they have no control over the currency, and it's just another altcoin among hundreds of others, or they maintain control over mining and the rest of the currency, at which point they don't actually need distributed mining, can run the whole thing on their own server, and it's no different from credit card reward points.

Increasing the fee beyond the standard 0.0001 will not increase your chances of getting into a block, so will not speed up the confirmation. The 30 minutes that the confirmation took was likely because it took 30 minutes for the miners to find a block. Blocks are found every 10 minutes on **average**, but that could mean anywhere from 1 minute to 1 hour.
To sell in another currency, get back out to the main wallet screen, go to settings, and change your default Local Currency. Then when you create a new sell order, it will use the new currency for the order.

You must be new here...
First of all, the reason so many people turned over so much money to "a complete joke of an operation" is because that operation used to be the only place to trade. Bitstamp and others showed up much much later, and just like Bitcoin itself has network effects - you go to the cryptocurrency everyone else uses - exchanges have it too - you trade on the platform that has the most other traders. Believe it or not, MtGox was the best place to be on for years before the others caught up to it.
As for price and greed, you are forgetting that bitcoin is absolutely useless at the price of $0, or even $0.01. It needs to grow to be able to fit other economies inside it. So "wow, Bitcoin is going up!" is not greed, it is directly translated into "Bitcoin adoption and use is increasing!"

No, it just means that anything you do is queued until the following day. Typically in the order that screws you the most. So if your account has $5 left, and that evening you deposit a $100 bill into your ATM and then use your debit card to buy something for $20, all of that will be queued until the next day. Once the bank opens, FIRST they will process the debit card transaction, causing an overdraft, then they will charge you a $25 overdraft fee, and LAST they will process your $100 deposit, minus the $25 fee. Yay banks 9.9

Not really. Dividends are usually reinvested by default to avoid capital gains taxes. You can either take dividends out as cash, reducing your portfolio by their amount, and pay taxes on gains, or you can take out the same portion of your stocks, reducing your portfolio by that amount, and pay taxes on gains. There is no difference between the two options, since you end up with the same amount of cash, same amount of investments, and (I think?) same amount due in taxes.


Also not really. Or not exactly rather. Most large established companies pay dividends. Most new and small companies do not pay dividends. Technically stock base price is calculated using formulas that take dividends, or potential dividends, into account, but stock prices reflect the health and potential of the company, not their divided payments. That's why stocks can be claimed to be over/under-valued. Plus dividend returns themselves are not always constant, and can increase or decrease year over year, affecting stock price and overall return.
As for shareholders, that also depends. Most shareholders who have a lot of wealth and want a stable income invest in large companies have have slow and steady growth, or pay a steady dividend. Those who want to grow their wraith invest in smaller growing companies with fast growing stock price, or growing commodity companies that pay a large but variable dividend (such as a small oil company that doesn't need money to grow from its newly discovered oil field, but canay out all the oil profits as dividends as the oil is pumped and sold). So, again, dividends aren't the most important thing here.

Technically, if the global population and economy continues to grow, then it will, it's just that the exponential rate will switch from the annual 3x we had for the last few years, to 1.03x global economic growth rate that the economy has grown at for the last century or two.

Regulatory uncertainty, need to trade on a floating market, tax and legal issues... With Realcoin at least they know what it's worth, and an apply all the same regulations they already have. It's literally swap one for the other, versus set up a buy/sell order and wait for the market to fill it, recording the price at time of exchange for tax filings.


There are a few decentralized exchange engines/projects already (they just don't have the USD component working), and they don't require an escrow. The transactions are atomic, where the traders put up a trade or find a trade they want, then create a transaction, and then both parties sign it before it becomes valid, making the trade happen directly between both of them at the same time. I'm not entirely sure of the the technical side of it, but I do know that it works for other altcoins. It won't be much of a stretch to implement this one too.

Limiting trades to a region you are in won't work too well, because people can just set their location to be anywhere they want. Also, as a frequent traveler, I sometimes contact people in areas I will be traveling to to set up trades ahead of time. The only thing I can think of to improve this is maybe to add user set ratings, with maybe a threshold of a certain number of 1 star ratings locking up an account. And maybe a filter that traders can set, such as no trades without someone who had a certain number of trades, or has some number of stars, but the problem with that is it will make things much harder for newbies.

GDP shrinking, exports falling, economy in recession
Doing remarkably well after their huge economic woes of 1990's, and is continuing to decrease their government debt. Much of that through massive privatization of government functions. So I wouldn't really call them very socialist, since they seem to be doing the opposite.
Pretty shitty unemployment rate, welfare costs and taxes on the rise, and stagnant or declining economy that can't seem to recover post 2008. They are already being compared to Italy, and unless they change things quickly, they will soon be headed towards same place that Greece is in.
German economy is likewise contracting and is in decline. Although I wouldn't call Germany a socialist state. It's quite capitalist compared to the likes of Venezuela, Argentina, Equador, etc.


Because if they DIDN'T know for a fact that they couldn't continue on without that oil money, they would be spending it to improve and expand, instead of **specifically saving it into a fund that will continue to support their welfare state for a few years after their oil runs out**. I'm not making up the reason. That is THEIR stated reason. They know that they can't support their government and social programs without that oil, and are saving extra oil money into a fund for when they run out of oil.

My concern is the claim that "PoS protects against someone with a majority stake forcing a change in the protocol and creating inflation" is unfounded, since, as I explained, just having a stake in something doesn't automatically keep you from reducing the value of that stake if you can simply convert your stake into another asset.


I actually take it one step further, and think of the cost to mitigate or neutralize the attack. We should be taking the possibility of future attacks for granted. With a PoW attack, you can either increase a competing PoW by buying more hardware to reduce the attacker's power, or mitigate the hashing attack in some other way by cutting the PoW attacker out of the network, or in the worst case, switching the hashing algorithm and making their hardware investment completely worthless, without actually screwing with everyone's money, since the Proof and the Money are separate ("decentralized" if you will). If someone with the largest stake decides to attack, it's not that easy to mitigate, since to reduce their power you either have to buy out their coins with something else (which will make them richer, or they can simply refuse to do), or you have to change the stake algorithm that cuts them, and their money, out of the system, which I'm not sure is possible if all the coins are supposed to be fungible.


As explained, killing your own value, is not a problem if you do it slowly, and convert it into other assets as you kill it. If PoS becomes the dominant system, even if you can't inflate it, you can slowly increase your own control of assets, such as property, gold, stocks, or other currencies, while decreasing your own and **everyone else's** value, resulting in a situation where you go from owning 51% stake in a currency while the world owns the other 49%, to you owning 90% of the world's assets while the rest of the world, made poorer by your attack, owns 10%.


There is a theory I've been pushing around: Proof of X to incentivise X. Proof of most efficient calculation using the most efficient energy source (hashing) incentivises creating more efficient processors and creating more efficient energy sources. This is evident by the fact that 28nm technologies were being developed by Intel and AMD with plans to be rolled out in October of this year, but thanks to Bitcoin mining and millions invested in ASIC development, 28nm was pushed out onto the market way back in March, accelerating the overall processor technology speeds by almost a year. Now, every year that you use a faster computer or a faster smartphone, you will thank Bitcoin that the device you are using is not as slow as devices were almost a year ago. Likewise the energy incentive is getting people to look for cheapest sources of energy on the planet. MaidSafe's proof of online-accessible hard drive storage will likewise lead to faster internet connections and cheaper methods of data storage. Here, with the proof of stake, the incentive is basically to have the highest stake, which in the long run can only lead to more and more people doing everything they can to concentrate wealth. There is no such incentive in a Proof of Work system, and concentration of mining power, while creating a threat of concentration of control, is not the same as a concentration of wealth, especially since in bitcoin mining, the incentives are to get costs of mining as close to revenues from mining, and thus profits from mining as close to 0 as possible.

Your actual "speech" actions are being done on my property, with the intention of desrupting my property. Libel, slander, and fraud are speech, too. You are free to say them, but you will get sued for damages. Also, don't confuse free speech with speech in private settings and computer media. Free speech is a right that exclusively protects you against the government trying to restrict you. Not private computer owners, or even public forum owners (free speech rights don't protect you from getting kicked off Reddit).
Besides, ideally my computer, or bitcoin hardware, is protected well enough that you can talk at it for trillions of years and not get anything out of it.

Big office ones with hard drives do (like giant Xerox machines), Small home and home office ones sometimes keep a cache in memory, but mostly store only the metadata, like who printed what file name at what time, and not the actual contents. To save resources, all the printers I've seen so far that print directly from USB sticks don't even load the image to the printer itself, and just read-and-print directly off the drive. From what I understand so far, just resetting your printer should wipe any image cache from RAM.
That said, we will be continuing to research printers and how much different models save, and will post this information at a later date (before we ship)

Fiat currencies do have intrinsic value. They can be used to patch small holes, wipe sit, and maybe help start a fire. Bitcoin has intrinsic value because it can be used to prove ownership, create smart contracts, and do other financialy things we find very useful and valuable. Even if bitcoins are completely worthless as a currency, there are still tons of other things we can use them for.
But yes, I'm not a fan of "intrinsic value," either, and keep correcting everyone that, technically, nothing has intrinsic value, since all value is objective. Use value is better, though only marginally so.

Are you sure about that? If the amount of bitcoin traded daily stayed the same in the last year or two, it means that the actual value traded has increased 10 to 100 fold during that period.
Really the only fees ATMs pay themselves are the fees charged by exchange rates. They typically don't even hold the bitcoins, and just purchase them on the spot at the exchange rate on whatever exchange they are hooked up to. Those that do hold bitcoins in reserve (not sure if any are left) may lose or gain on the fluctuating value of the bitcoins they are holding, but they are still selling at the spot exchange rate, so they are basically "investing" in bitcoin like anyone else, on top of getting a fee for selling some of it off and buying it right back as soon as they can.
So, I can undercut a bitcoin ATM that exchanges instantly by selling at, say, 5%, while still paying the same 0.5% exchange fee they do, and still make a profit, or I can undercut a bitcoin holding ATM by also charging lower fees, and if I hold about the same amount of bitcoin they do, we are exactly the same from the "investing in bitcoin" volatility point, i.e. we both lost and gain the same from bitcoin volatility.

E-mail: digital text, runs over communications network (TCP/IP), uses centralized computer servers.
Text messaging: digital text, runs over communications network (TCP/IP), uses centralized computer servers.
Both are very similar. Really the software on the servers is the main difference. There is way more difference between dollars running through centralized bank clearing houses, with most of the accounting and security still done by hand, versus bitcoin that works directly person to person. I'd actually say it's like receiving a post letter vs receiving an email and printing it. The end result is the same, but the internal structure is radically different.


The payment goes into an address that neither you nor the merchant can get money out of unless both of them agree on sending it somewhere (multi signature). If the merchant sends the goods and the buyer doesn't release the money, no one gets it. Since the buyer already lost the money, he might as well send it on to the merchant. If the seller never sends the merchandize, he never gets paid either, and has more of an incentive to either refund, or send something to get the money. And if the merchant sends the merchandize, and it's broken, he has an incentive to deal with the buyer so he could get the buyer to release the money, instead of just ignore the customer

I've looked into all but Factom (which I only eard about today), and have read their propositions (and talked to the guys at conferences), but it's been a while, and considering how much they change, I wasn't sure if they still used something on top of bitcoin, separate from bitcoin, or whatever. I really need to sit down and get Maidsafe testnet running on my system...
Still, Daniel's criticism would apply in that market demand for the coin is == price to purchase those resources. If there is a free floating market for the price of the service (like, if those offering storage set their own fees, like bitcoin miners can set minimum transaction fees), then the price of the coin will simply be whatever the minimum is charged for that service. If it is set by the system itself, as Daniel says, people are likely sell the coin for bitcoin as soon as they "mine" it, and only buy it when they need to pay for the service, driving the price near zero. 
P.S. Thanks for the links. I'll have to et up to date on how these work.

Point to me where in my statement, the gist of which is "we had interest in securing private keys before, but not nearly to the level that bitcoin brought about," that I claim that security that bitcoin uses is "the first of its kind."


Read the BIPs. We're past 70 now. Some were feature improvements, a lot were security improvements.


How about something that will prevent a keylogger or malware from stealing your key? Or a way to sign or encrypt files using multiple keys that don't reside on the same system (like multisig). Or some hardware device specifically for signing or encrypting files that isn't exposed to the web. Or hell, how about some actually simple to implement PGP signing and encryption for e-mail that is easy enough to use that it's not relegated to only computer nerds.


I have heard and use or used all of those, prior to Bitcoin. How many times do you hear stories about some security hole being discovered, and patched, in those? Hell, how many times do you even hear about those in the media? And, frankly, how many of those (besides maybe Tor) are actually usable by "normal" people, or being pushed to be? Most people are not tech savvy, and will either have no clue why or how to use them, or will completely screw up their security if they try to implement them (logging into Facebook while using Tor for example). As far as I know, there's little development to make those things secure enough to be idiot proof. You really can't argue the point that bitcoin has exposed tons of massive security holes in our computer and internet infrastructure, which all those things you mentioned have at most barely touched on.


Then how come Bitcoin developers are working so hard to improve bitcoin key storage security, wile that doesn't seem to be the case anywhere else? If key storage is a solved problem, why have tens of thousands of bitcoins been stolen through stolen keys? Why are things like Trezor, Bitsafe, SSS, paper wallets, and multisig was even needed?


Despite being released in October of last year, we have one Android app with only about 100 downloads, the number of implementations on SQRL site hasn't really changed over the last few months, if you look at Github commits, you'll see that 11 of them have not been updated for 11 months, and only one is updated recently, and I haven't seen ANY websites that actually implement it. That compared to current active development by major wallet developers (meaning hundreds of thousands of users will have it on their phones), a large established company, and already planned support by bitcoin companies and exchanges for their sites.




"After a Bitcoin address is chosen, or created on the fly, the full bitid URI is signed with the address’ private key. The signature and public key are then POSTed to the callback url."
First of all, as you said, it's **draft** specification. The devs discussing  and planning this out have said they are considering using HD wallets for it. This is why the quote says "a Bitcoin address is chosen, or created on the fly"


That's not possible, because the hype train started after the initial proposal was made, which, as mentioned, referenced SQRL already.


Is this a bias, or is there some source? The people I know, including many working on Bitcoin-QT, Andreas Schilbach, the guys behind Armory, and the guys behind Mycelium all have strong security and crypto backgrounds.
P.S. Thanks for the crypto writeup. It was informative w/ regards to PGP. I always thought of it as a standard for authentication and encryption, but I guess it's more of a wrapper for the standards. I guess kind of like a Media Player, with the RSA and others being the codecs.

Pretty cool that bitcoin doesn't actually need any of those things to be safe, with it being a push instead of a pull system.


Neither does bitcoin.


Fraud is not a technical error. Technical errors in bitcoin itself are almost unheard of. Technical errors with bitcoin wallets aren't part of bitcoin itself.


This makes no sense. I can't move my telephone onto the TV. I can't move my internet onto PCB radio. I can't download files over a string between two cups. Internet is just as closed as bitcoin.


That extremely expensive PoW protocol is extremely cheap compared to what's needed for the current financial system to work. As for concentration of mining power, there is incentive to concentrate up to 50%, and a huge risk of punishment to go anywhere above 51%. Proven to work in practice twice already.


Nothing. And it has. Because, like Bitcoin, it's an open source system developed by volunteers.


It's not being resisted, it's being debated, with alternatives proposed. The hassle to clients will be minimal for something like that. Just change a line of code, with many month's of advance warning.


Easy. Add those changes as dormant code, automatically activated at some block # months later. Have wallet developers spend the next 12 to 18 months adding that code to their apps and testing it on testnet to make sure it works (**Testnet** is the experiment, not Bitcoin). When by the time that block # comes around a year or more later, everyone will already be using apps with that dormant code, and as soon as that block hits, the code activates and switches all users over. People won't even notice it. Bitcoin did this once or twice already.


He never stated it that it was "just an experiment." Why would he have to explicitly state that it's not an experiment, for everyone to know that it wasn't? He and other devs HAVE stated that bitcoin is still under development, that it's beta, that it's risky to use. But none of that suggests it's an experiment. On the contrary, it's them saying this is a final system they are working on that is not entirely ready yet.
 &gt;Opening the internet to the general public, after ~15 yeears of experience in a limited, computer-savy public, was an explicit decision, much debated and publicly announced. Was there a similar decision and announcement to open bitcoin?
Was there a similar decision and announcement to open Linux to the general public, inviting people to put their resources and businesses into it?


And note we still use planes based on their concept, with wings for lift, and some system of propulsion that pushes air backwards.


By that logic the internet is just an experiment. It's IPV4 limit, HTML1.0, and bandwidth limited by government to under 50Kbps over phone lines is not adequate for THE global communications system.
Point is, you don't build products to be able to support the world from the start. You always build them to be good enough, and expand them with time.


Computer nerds though it was a technical curiosity to be experimented with, sure, but only because Bitcoin didn't have any monetary value at all at the time. But it wasn't "only later in 2010" that libertarians got involved. You got that completely backwards. The first libertarian, or perhaps cypherpunk (anti-government anarchist) to adopt it, did so in 2009, when he wrote the Bitcoin white paper, using technologies and ideas invented by other libertarians and cypherpunks (such as Adam Back, Hal Finney, and others), and invited other developers, some of whom are also libertarians and cypherpunks, to come work on it with him. Bitcoin was invented specifically to address concerns libertarians have, such as dislike for inflationary fiat and government backed banking systems. Despite what you guys might wish, Bitcoin wasn't some pure innocent thing that was eventually overtaken by libertarians; it was invented and developed by anti-fiat and anti-banker libertarians and anarchists from the very start. It was only later that non-libertarians came in and decided this would be a good system for established banks and governments to build on top of too.


It's goal as an investment, or more specifically store of value more secure than government currency, was the goal from the start. That's why it was designed to be deflationary to begin with. As for the get-rich-quick scheme, people piled into it when its price was going up, as always happens in any price bubble. Note that those people either sold out at the top and are now trolling other bitcoiners, telling them it's worthless, or lost their money on the subsequent decline and left. The main people who are still here are the same ones who were here before the bubble, who still believe bitcoin is about it's libertarian technology, not its price.

The gist of the other thread was that Bitcoin works 24/7, while banks, including the ACH system they use for almost everything, work only during banking hours.  Which, right there, is evidence that some people, like you, are so stupid and clueless that they don't even know how the system they trust with their livelihood works.
Also, are you trying to insult me by calling me a bitcoin shill? Lol!
@_date: 2014-12-26 02:35:57
Lol! What? That's a pretty stupid argument. They all have a whole lot of bitcoin, and are all investing money in ventures that work on bitcoin itself. The technology. It's like saying airliner  companies didn't put their money into airplanes, they put their money into ventures that make money out of passengers. Or VISA didn't put its money into a global financial payment system, but into ventures that charge merchants transaction fees. Your obvious intent with that statement is that those VCs are TOTALLY ripping us bitcoiners off, by spending millions on developing bitcoin technology, and providing all of us with awesome services. I sure feel robbed and cheated.

I may be guilty of this somewhat, but only because these negatives are often the same misconceptions, problems everyone is already working on, or long-solved problems that have been discussed years ago. Things like claims that anyone who gets 50% of hashing power can destroy bitcoin (they can't, because wallets/users enforce the rules, not miners), or that bitcoin doesn't scale ([it does](, or that private keys are easy to steal (which is being improved on constantly). Though I don't "attack," just explain to them why they are wrong, or why their "brilliant realization" is nothing new, for some people, being confronted with facts is an attack in itself (look how awfully religious nuts are being "attacked").


If after 2008, with all the news about big banks being completely incompetent and committing actual fraud around the world, causing damages in the hundreds of **b**illions of dollars, you still think the financial system is perfectly fine, you probably have been living under a rock. Hell, EVERYONE was bashing the financial system then. We just didn't forget about it, and realizing that nothing's changed, haven't forgiven them.


You are committing the " No one needs bitcoin, because I have a credit card " fallacy. Are you willing to share your German bank account with everyone? Also, no, your German bank account is NOT "free." You are giving them YOUR money, and are getting almost nothing in return, while they "rent" it to others for a fee. It's like you letting someone borrow your apartment, they rented it out for a few hundred euros a month, and at the end of the month bought you a ten euro pizza. That wasn't a free pizza, they took hundreds of euros of your money, and gave you a tiny present to make you feel better.


Here you are making the "technology never makes any progress" fallacy. Email and internet back in 1990 had very very few benefits too, since it was much easier just to phone someone. But the one thing that internet had that telephones did not, just as bitcoin has that PayPal and banks do not, is a free and open platform that anyone could develop on to of, without having to ask anyone for permission, or pay royalty fees for using their closed system. Bitcoin development and innovation is moving MUCH faster than what banks are doing, and it's only a matter of time until your financial system looks like an old rotary phone compared to the internet.


Look at the volatility of a penny stock, compared to a MidCap stock, compared to a huge company stock. Or even the volatility of a currency of a small country compared to a currency of a large one. As bitcoin grows in use, its volatility will continue to shrink. It's already MUCH less volatile than it was a year ago, and the year before. And even if we assume that you are correct, and bitcoin is only used to transfer money, it's very easy to set up a hedge system where people can hold bitcoins pegged to something else, like euros, and have no volatility whatsoever, while people who like risks and investment, like bankers, hedge fund managers, and Wall Street, can invest in the volatility on the other end. Coinapult recently launched a service called Locks that does just that.
The best, and completely new, thing about bitcoin, though, is that it's an open innovation platform, which in a few short years has given us multi-signature addresses, Proof of Existence, HD wallets, automatic mixing through CoinJoin, tipping bots, "2.0" systems like Colored Coin and Mastercoin, microchannel transactions that can do over 100 transactions per second, tree chains, side chains, autonomous contracts, and autonomous entities. In the last century, our closed off banking system has given us ATMs, debit cards, and online banking... Kind of like how land line phones only allowed fringe innovations, like answering machines and cordless phones, and it wasn't until an open communications platform like the Internet came along that we started to have massive communication innovations.
P.S. I'm not attacking you, and I hope it didn't come out that way, but yours was an excellent example of the typical thinking of and mine is an example of why we get so frustrated with you guys. So, thank you for posting.

I have used purse.io for over $700 worth of purchases from Amazon so far. Setting the discount to 5% gets your wish list picked up within a few hours. Only issues I have had were minor bugs on the website, such as difficulty releasing coins once my order arrived, but their support is very responsive, and was able to fix the issues very quickly. Most of those issues were early web development related bugs, and have since been fixed. I haven't had any issues of getting scammed by those buying wish list items, since I don't release coins until I verify that I got everything.

Hi. I'm still here. Mycelium supports Shamir's Secret Sharing, not multisig. It's a way to split a single private key into pieces, so that you need N-of-N pieces to put it back together. Multisig requires completely separate private keys to sign off on an account. SSS is just easier and more straighforward to use for people who will be storing their keys themselves, instead of delegating control to others.
We discussed using the different printers option (which SSS can work with too), but that would require us to keep track of how many keys were generated, with the only input being that the device was powered on, and could result in issues  where key 1 was printed, key 2 failed, and when the device was removed and reinserted, key 3 was printed, with no key 2 available. It is difficult to do right, and can cause issues and lost coins from missing keys. Plus it's overkill, when you can just disconnect your printer, and reset it after you are done.
After checking around, it seems that only large office copiers have hard drives, and hope printers do not. The ones that do store some stuff in memory, only store metadata such as file name was printed by computer name at some time and date. So, please don't use these on office copiers or print stations, and you should be ok.

Either they have to keep this chain secret from the rest of the blockchain, making their miners wonder why they are not getting paid for valid blocks they have submitted, or they will have to keep it secret for a short time, releasing short forks every few hours, making it blatantly obvious what they are up to. Either way, their win will be short lived, with very little reward, and no possibility of future rewards.


Since they will very quickly be detected for doing something like that, users can just start rejecting their blocks, kicking them out of the system completely. The "emergency" version of this would be wallet developers coming out with a quick patch accepting blocks from only the remaining trusted pools, which will quickly turn the attacker's blockchain into a worthless pseudo-altcoin.
Or, at the last, them not including transactions means they won't be getting transaction fees, meaning their miners will be earning less than elsewhere, and even if not detected, they will lose their business to some other pool.


Until cex.io controls actual 51% by themselves, not a problem. And if they become malicious, they risk making their hardware worthless, due to reasons above, or bitcoin itself becoming worthless


Also not entirely true, since not only will they have to compete against everyone else's hashrate, but the further back they go, the more they will have to work just to catch up. And doing something like that is also extremely blatantly visible, meaning they will be caught and punished swiftly. 
The 51% attack is a threat, sure, but it has been considered and evaluated in depth, and lots of retaliatory attacks against a 51% attack have been invented too, making the act of performing a 51% attack a major threat to the attacker as well. It's basically a kind of a MADD scenario, where bitcoin users know they can be attacked by someone with a 51% of hashing power, but the potential attackers know they can be attacked and destroyed right back for attempting it, so no one tries.

It's an address I generated myself using my mining hardware and vanitygen back when I was mining on GPU cards, generated WAY back in 2011. It took me about two months to get with my 550Mh/s dual GPU rig, because apparently "R" is A LOT more difficult to get than "r" for whatever stupid reason. I have had that address in my wallets, being monitored and mostly unused ever since, keeping close track of it and guarding it like a hawk, because I use it as my PGP key to bitcoin-sign my messages to prove they came from me (if needed), or to send from it if I need to prove that I made that transaction (or donation). It's even printed as a QR code on the back of my business cards. So nobody else has access to it but me. Perhaps at some point I sent money from it to MtGox, or withdrew money from MtGox, and it got associated ever since.

Oh, OK, well awesome then


Hardware. The humans that own the awesomely huge and powerful datacenters don't (apparently usually) own the hardware that's in their datacenters. That's owned by a bunch of different other humans. Kind of like the humans that own mining pools that have near 51% mining power do not own the mining hardware that's used on their pools.
Point is, things are still much more decentralized than some people fear.


It doesn't look like CEX let's you choose where you mine. From their site, it looks like they just rent you "ownership" in the mining power, and let you keep any profits that the miner gets, but they choose the "best" place to mine from. So they are still making sure their hashing power is used responsibly, even if you are renting it from them. (Though o might be wrong, since o haven't used CEX before, and am only going by the claims on their site)


There is no problem. You purposed something you thought was a problem, I explained that it wasn't, you said "but..." and brought up more things that you claim are a problem, I told you it's not a problem, and you brought yet more things. It's not a problem because attempting a 51% attack will bring you enormous problems in return, so people don't do it. It's an expensive way to commit suicide, basically.

Mycelium will only charge for the privilege of finding someone to swap bitcoins for cash with you. And you don't have to pay a fee for that privilege if you don't want to.
Don't forget, bank cards aren't free, either. They charge about 2.7%, versus bitcoin's fees of about 1% or less. And those fees are still only for currency exchange (trading BTC for USD). Once places start accepting bitcoin directly, the fees will be near zero.

The main point is not really how secure they are, but rather that they are massive central targets, which become a more and more profitable reward for a successful hack as they grow. By contrast, hacking decentralized bitcoin accounts requires you to individually hack every single user, one by one, and your reward may end up being a few bucks.

From what I know, spending from an address exposes your public key, which until then was also kept private (it's a hash of your public bitcoin address), and quantum computers will be able to break public keys eventually. Once that happens, we'll very likely have been on a different quantum-secure algorithm for a while then, but any old keys that have been spent from will still be vulnerable to quantum attacks.

Combine 3% credit card fee, fixed per-transaction fees (varied, but about $0.20), plus 3% lost annually to credit card theft, plus cost of compliance for storing personal data and credit card info, and a small business merchant spends at least 8% to 10% to handle credit cards.

@_date: 2014-08-08 03:16:46
If your private key is secure (not leaked), it's anonymous, because all authentication is done using private keys, and all communication is encrypted using the private keys of the people communicating, before it leaves your phone. For this to not be anonymous, your private keys would have to be leaked, which we are fairly certain is not something that happens, otherwise people would be losing their money.

Hi. Yes, what everyone else said, and yes, the private key and password are wiped as soon as you hit send, with the change going back to your BIP38 address. Since we're working on implementing HD wallets, we haven't been focusing on being able to customize where the change goes.
And yes, your android is WAY safer than your windows PC, especially if the android is not rooted. Android executes every app in it's own Virtual Machine, meaning no app has access to any memory or storage of any other app, so when your private key is imported when using a BIP38 wallet, it only exists briefly in protected memory, invisible to all other apps. Windows, on the other hand, lets any program see all available memory, and thus malware can very easily steal keys from memory as soon as they are imported. So, as long as you use a **NON-rooted** phone, using BIP38 keys you store on paper should be almost as secure as using cold storage (baring any zero day Android exploits)

It's "open source" in that all the code is open and available for anyone to check. We just ask that any modifications or improvements go through us (which we have never had issues with implementing), and ask that people don't make forks, because if someone's Alt-Mycelium wallet craps out, we will be the ones asked to get it fixed. We don't have the resources for that.

Milly is right. It's not that miners will not be willing to sell at a loss, they won't be willing to mine at a loss in the first place. Miners have no choice but to sell at whatever price the market offers them, because if some miner decides to sell at Price X to cover costs, some other miner will undercut at X-1 to sell faster. Everyone's mined bitcoins are exactly the same, so no miner can ask for a premium on his bitcoins over another, even to cover increased costs.

Not sure where you're getting the "secretive" stuff from. We just gauge their opinion based on their reactions and concerns. From that we just get a list of people whom we can ask for help if some negative bitcoin bill comes up for a vote. No secret political tactics here. I don't think the CDC is secretive, either, since it just started, and was public about the very first thing it did. Plus you totally misunderstood the enemy thing. I meant know which politicians see bitcoin as a threat, or think it's only used to fund terrorism, so we can stay far away from them and support their opposition.

Companies produce wealth, whether that's money, assets, or whatever. As they get better at it, the value of their stock, their "wealth making thing" goes up. Bitcoin companies produce wealth by using bitcoin, and bitcoin produces wealth by making existing financial and asset management things more efficient. As it does, the value of its "wealth making thing" goes up. Bitcoin, as a whole ecosystem that includes the various bitcoin companies, apps, software and hardware, is like both, gold, and stock in the bitcoin economy. And, likewise, as more companies develop it, it will rise in value, and as they fail, it will drop, just like stock of a large conglomerate corporation.

If the IRS can't figure it out, and you don't report it, the IRS, as a rule, assumes the cost basis is $0. In other words, they will assume that 100% of your bitcoin trade was capital gain, and charge you tax on the whole amount.

It won't be very practical, since the entropy comes from the device being powered on. You would have to unplug it, wait three seconds, plug it back in, and wait a few more seconds for it to do its thing, every time you wanted more entropy bits. However, since the amount of bits it creates is frikin enormous, maybe doing it just once will be sufficient as a seed for something... or something.

And the cop shouldn't go to jail for doing his job, either. This isn't a "news over-sensationalizes" thing. Although maybe the news does avoid publishing stories about cops who commit horrible crimes, and then later get sent to prison for them. Not sure why they would avoid such stories, when the sentencing happens later and still gives them plenty of time to run a "Look at what this cop did!" story.


Well then you mostly believe the same things I do too. The only difference is that I believe that a system that gives you power and control over people with diminished recourse (when it comes to hearsay, cops pretty much always win in court over those they charge) attracts not only people who want to serve people and protect justice, but also people who would want to have such power and control over people with diminished resource. And those people are assholes. When you look at the built-in incentives and long-term trends, the end results are rather predictable. But hey, maybe those new wearable cameras cops are starting to wear will stop (they apparently dropped complaints against cops by 86% where they were used, which also kinda says something about cop abuse).

Imagine the process to open a bank account that lets you use an ATM. Go to a bank (or bank's site online), fill out forms, wait for approval, etc. With this, you install an APP, and suddenly your bitcoin account works just like any other bank account: you can use it to pay for things online, and pull cash out of an ATM. It's simply updating the old system that a lot of people are used to, to the new platform. And if you travel (and these ATMs become prevalent), you'll be able to pull out cash from your bitcoin "account" wherever you go.

We claimed BIP32, which is HD wallets, not BIP38, which is encrypted wallets. You need at least 500 megs of ram to do BIP38, which is not feasible for a small cheap device like this. Some would argue that the 2-of-3 split key is much more secure than just a key and a password.

Around $0.22 plus 0.5%, which for an average transaction of ~$30 comes out to around ~1.5% per transaction
EDIT: Wiki claims that ["In the United States, the fee averages approximately 2% of transaction value"]( though since it's a combination of fixed and percentage, I guess that depends on how much you buy. A $1 stick of gum would be ($0.005 + $0.22) / $1 = 22.5% fee, so that gum better have a hell of a markup!

Neither of them has even gone past 50%, because miners know they are safe as long as they stay below the 50% threshold, and move when they get too close. Happened with BTC Guild, too.So a pool getting close to 50% while miners are actively monitoring them isn't a problem I don't think.

He is technically correct. I have sent coins from one account to a second, from the second to a third, and from the third back to the first again, all within a few seconds, and had all transactions confirm at the same time in the next block. However, an unconfirmed transaction is an "unconfirmed input" when respect right away, and some payment processors will reject it to avoid a possible double spend attack. Happened to me when I sent a bunch of money to some paper wallets, and then before I got a block, tried to use the change to buy a gift card through Gyft. BitPay didn't approve the transaction, so I didn't get my card right when I needed it, but all transactions were confirmed in the next block, and an email to BitPay support resolved the issue.
The reason for the initial BitPay rejection could also have been because the previous transaction was very complex and low priority, with a possibility of never confirming, so maybe BitPay does accept unconfirmed inputs. Coinbase, which accepts Dell payments, may be much more lenient.

It's, uh, not that easy. Within 5 seconds, almost all of the network has already heard of your transaction, and will very likely reject any others you try to broadcast. I guess you might get lucky some tiny percent of the time, but I doubt it'll be worth the extra hassle. It's $3 bucks O.o

This could be dangerous, since a user who is not familiar with this could accidentally send the change coins to some address they don't have a backup to.

It's an interesting theory. I went to check out the trading volume on OKCoin ( and BTCChina ( two of the largest exchanges, and the graphs don't really seem to fit that idea.

It does not hold priv keys, and keys are destroyed when you disconnect the power. It's possible to write up code that will do what you ask, but we won't be implementing it to start. There are concerns that if you plug it into your printer, it doesn't detect properly, and you pull it out and plug it in again, the device may think the second key has already been generated. Basically it would have to be an advanced user option only.

@_date: 2014-10-30 19:13:27
Technically... yes. Though better options will be some encryption method that is not as intensive as BIP38, OR a built-in counter that splits the key into 2-of-3 parts, printing a single part every time you power it up. So you print one part on your printer, second part on another printer, and third maybe save on your computer. No single device gets the keys.

Why not proof of mining fee? Send 0 coins to some address, with some minimum required mining fee. You get your proof of financial stake, the coins are not lost, and miners get a boost. Maybe you could even figure out how to get these to go specifically to P2Pool as donations or something.

The app itself is fully open source. The servers are proprietary. Reason is that we want to be responsible for any issues that may come up with those, and be able to fix them quickly. If someone else was running a server, was having issues, and one of our customer's wallets connected to it, we wouldn't know what's wrong or how to fix it, but may still get blamed for our wallet app not working. Plus the code on the servers changes so frequently that it would be hard for others to keep up (we update and add features to it at least twice a week.

Rassah from Mycelium here. Both apps have you store your bitcoin keys, and don't have access to them directly. The reasons are just habit, where people started using Blockchain and simply continue to do so, some people don't have smartphones or don't have Androids (my parents didn't have smartphones and I recommended they use Blockchain, and now that they have smartphones, it's iPhones :P), and a slightly less used but still important reason is accessibility. Some people move around and travel a lot, and can't always depend on their Mycelium phone to be there (can be lost or stolen). If they are abroad when that happens, they may not have access to their backup, so even if they get a replacement phone, they may still be out of luck. Blockchain would still let them access their coins from any computer.

The code is public for anyone to review, and we always welcome other contributions, but we request that the wallet app only be distributed by Mycelium, and not be distributed as custom moded versions by others. Reason is that we wish to maintain high quality, provide good support for the wallet, and want to control our brand and reputation. Plus these wallets connect to our proprietary software nodes, which won't be able to differentiate between an error code created by our wallet, or by someone else's. If people make and distribute copies of their own Mycelium wallets, then if something breaks, or doesn't work right with our servers, we may be blamed and asked to fix it, but won't be able to help or fix the issue since it's not on our end.

Sure. Every Android device that has come out in the last year or two (maybe more), which has ARM processor version 9 and above, includes something called ARM TrustZone, which is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). It's a hardware part of the processor that is able to run completely separate from the rest of the processor. Almost like a second CPU completely separate from your main CPU. Problem is, no one wrote drivers for that thing, and Android and phone manufacturers don't enable it, so it has just been sitting there for years, doing nothing. Rivetz is working on developing drivers and an API interface for it, which would allow you to load code into that TEE, and have it run completely separately from your Android phone. The only way to communicate with it would be through a single encrypted channel, almost like a USB cable connecting two devices that are otherwise not connected.
What this means is that you will be able to have a TEE hardware wallet running in your Android phone, that is completely separated from the rest of your phone - including operating system, processor, memory, storage, and even display and input - to which your Android wallet software can send transaction requests through a secure encrypted channel, which that TEE wallet will check, pop up with its own screen over your OS asking you to verify the transaction, and when you do, sign it and send it back through that encrypted channel, which your wallet app will then broadcast. It is the equivalent of having a Trezor built right into your Android phone, without the expense and hassle of having an actual Trezor. And it should theoretically be just as secure.

Why do you think that? They would have to either type the private key manually, or scan the key with a webcam with QR software and copy/paste into a wallet. That's not a "normal user" thing. Most people will hopefully use phones to spend from them.


Which is why we recommend printers without hard drives. And especially not office printers. Cheap household ones (that normal users have) don't have those.

Hard to determine, since you have users who actually hold and invest bitcoin (based on number of wallets or addresses, but some online wallets share addresses), users who only use it for transactions and payments (BitPay and Coinbase accepting merchants), and users who only use it for the things it let's them buy, who only hold bitcoins while buying stuff, but who otherwise ding care about bitcoin (anecdotal evidence is that my local university has about 5 members in a bitcoin club, and 50+ bitcoin users who don't know anything about our care about bitcoin, and only use it at places like Silk Road). My personal guess is about 1.5 to 3 million "users".

If these guys back dollarcoin with enough assets, audited trust, and bank backing, then they won't have to be the ones redeeming dollarcoins for USD. Whatever banks they get to agree to use this thing will just redeem it for you, since the bank knows they can redeem it themselves if they need to. So the dollarcoins will be managed by Brock's group, while the actual exchanging in and out of will be handled by banks. That at least solves the problem of setting up a dollarcoin "exchange."
I agree that reglators might get a bit pissy about people swapping essentially digital cash around without anyone tracking where it goes. As for dollarcoin vs bitcoin, the are obviously not the same, and Brock never claims that either. I don't know why people just assumed that this dollarcoin idea is Brock's "statement" that be believes this thing is better than Bitcoin. Despite what little I know about him (from personal conversations over many rounds of beer), I'm fairly convinced that this is just his idea of creating a "stepping stone" to make transition into bitcoin easier for the overall economy.

The Magic the Gathering nerd who created that exchange sold it to finance nerds way back in early 2011. He was also a failnerd at writing software, and the Magic the Gathering trading platform had security holes and issues that caused the crash from $30 back in 2011. So the new finance nerd owners scrapped the entire exchange, and wrote a new one from scratch. Turns out they fail at writing software to. But the point is that there is nothing left of Magic the Gathering here besides the name. Computers, software, trading platform owners, and employees are all completely different.

We found out why we were having "a lot of those" issues lately. One of the servers had a corrupt drive, and kept getting stuck on an old block. We took it offline for now, so it shouldn't be causing any more problems. If something gets stuck again in the future, exit out of the wallet completely and restart it. Since it picks a server at random, it will likely pick the not broken one and work once more.

That's one of the things I don't have. So I'm having to rely on gift cards and third party services. Here are my usuals:
* Groceries: Gyft card for Target. I could use Whole Foods, too, but I hear they're expensive.
* Household items: Target, same as above, or Amazon through Purse.io. Amazon PrimePantry lets you order most of the things you will need around the home, and even some foods.
* Web stuff: brawker.com
* Gasoline: This one is tricky. Gyft for $25 or $50 Sears cards, then at Sears you can use them to buy Shell gas cards. Sears is the only place I found that lets you buy gift cards with gift cards. Bonus, you get 3% cash back, and gas cards are treated as cash, so you get cash discounts at stations.
* Car maintenance: Sears auto with Sears gift cards from Gyft
* Phone: I use prepaid (T-Mobile's $30 unlimited data) plans, and pick up refills at Target, but you can also refill almost any prepaid phone in the world with piiko.com
* Bills: Pretty much any bill you have you can pay with bylls.com. The fees are a bit much, though not too bad compared to, say, Bitcoin ATM or LCB trading fees
* Travel: CheapAir for flight and hotels, or Expedia for hotels. 9Flats lets you get Bed&amp;Breakfasts for bitcoin, too, but it has to be instant reservation, and the selection is limited.

It's not because they are virtual, it's because they are tracked through a single ledger and everyone verifies each coin.

Probably because of what he actually wrote, whom he got his bitcoin ideas from, and how he actually designed bitcoin


He never mentioned anything about drugs, so I don't know why


Only because they don't understand how the system works, or have no idea what a ponzi is.


who created a deflationary money which follows libertarian (austrian) economics, and included an explicit claim of disaproval of quantitative easing and governments fudging with currency in the very first block.


And again you are on the "bitcoin has no way to technologically improve, so obviously it will have these same problems for ever" fallacy. Your analogies are broken. It is actually as if [insert-group-you-don't-like-here] invested in flyer one **technology** to use it to bypass railroad monopolies, smuggle goods, and to sell transportation to the general public. Which, they did, as you can see with modern planes and airlines.


But it works. It works perfectly fine. And it is adopted by a lot of pretty large companies to work alongside their other payment systems. Millions of people, who aren't testers, experimenters, or developers, have used it millions of times to send money and pay for goods and services. So the idea that it is "just a prototype" completely clashes with reality. Bitcoin the system **WORKS** right now. Perfectly. The only concerns are about future improvements.


Would you claim the same with regards to suggestions to invest in Google before it went IPO? Or how about learning to write software back when computers were only for computer nerds? Or investing in 3D printer technology now? Some people are able to recognize technologies that will change the world, and understand concepts like network effects, and thus can pick out winners.


Find predictions of what professional stock traders think the S&amp;P500 would be by the end of the year. You'll find the exact same disparate results. Also, find predictions of what people thought bitcoin would be worth by the end of 2013, when it started the year at $7. No one even said $100. People thought $20, maybe $50, not $1,200. They thought $100 would be maybe in 5 years. At the same time, if a year ago you were to ask those people in that YouTube video about bitcoin's adoption, none would have predicted Expedia, Microsoft, Time Inc., PayPal, and others would join. Everyone thought that won't happen for another 5 years. So, you win some, you lose some, but the winner here is technological adoption, which is more important than price. So this whole concern of yours about missed guesses is meaningless.


It's not due to lack of new user adoption, that's for sure. Why do you think it is? My guess is more places to use it means more old holders are spending it.


Yep, you don't understand advantages of bitcoin and its underlying technology **at all**.
If you want examples of experiments, compare bitcoin to testnet. Testnet is experiment. Testnet coins aren't worth anything, are experimented with, and the blockchain is reset every once in a while. None of that happens with bitcoin, the production system. 
What is your point with all of this "bitcoin is an experiment" thing? Should businesses that invested $300 million into it, and people who have a combined $5,000,000,000 worth of wealth in it just abandon it because it is "just an experiment" and should actually be worth $0? Are you upset that people are using a system, which seems to be working perfectly, despite you being absolutely sure that it's just an experiment that shouldn't be used?

@_date: 2014-12-21 20:18:38
Heh, sorry for trying to be cordial.


You must be retarded, because you are arguing about something without even understanding the underlying technology. Bitcoin can handle 7 TPS, period. If by some miracle (natural progression of technological adoption) bitcoin reaches a steady stream of 3 tps, the bitcoin wallets that still use uncompressed keys will be forced to switch. Compressed normal transactions are small enough to fit into a block at 7tps. The reason only 3 is done now is because a lot of wallets haven't changed to using compressed keys, and the occasional multisig or other complex transaction. Also, unconfirmed transactions grow in priority until they become a higher priority than new ones, even if those new ones may have higher fees. So worst case scenario, some big transaction comes in and takes up most of the block space, pushing the small normal ones out, but after a while all those small ones will become high enough priority to shove themselves into a block, even if more and more large transactions keep coming, so at least some blocks will still have 7 tps.
P.S. go to blockchain.info and look at the transactions going through. Note that many normal transactions are 225 bytes in size, or thereabout. Now let's do the math:
250 bytes x 7 per second x 60 per minute x 10 minutes per block = 1,050,000 bytes. Tada! It fits.


And this car being sold to you in 1910, where no road can handle more than 15mph, all fuel is made at home anyway, there's few places to drive so the tires will last you for many many years, etc.
Bitcoin requiring a hard fork does not mean "OMG! BITCOIIN IS BROKEN! ABANDON SHIP!" Who the fuck cares! A fork is in the works, and we have plenty of time to implement it. Especially if more and more wallets start implementing CoinJoin, and making each transaction cover 5 to 10 transfers among completely different people.

No, not like a bank account. If I told you 0093533 33486110, or 34-78-32, or  code 7774327, did I give you money? Did I transfer any wealth to you? Are you able to precisely quantify that wealth? Did I say something that specifically gave wealth to you, and you only? No. 
However, if I say
30440220188fe69166a34c8f1a2671a3458120899f08730c68f68866d95046bfd66c13df02206e022c26726e5cdac9d90f0b6261e1347d28d36dda54ba52dad36e5a18c3097a01 02ee3159f9f55b7904c25a71c57c16ce2547568b1ccf73997ebcbac14b70ea1db5
that "word" specifically gives the owner of whoever owns bitcoin address 1GRsV6psyULfwhLvm44UPqjUWjdVjxjiwk **over $200,000 dollars** worth of value. I cal LITERALLY transfer value with a word. Not with an instruction for someone to get into an account where I store IOUs issued by someone else to call up yet another entity, sync up with them, and transfer these IOUs from my account into theirs, whereby some other person receives it, registers it as belonging to them, and holds it on their behalf, waiting for more instructions. But with a single word that itself has and transfers value.
Of course, the overall point is hat one system requires a large organization of people that writes promises, manages promises, handles promises for others, and moves those promises around almost by hand, while the other system is just a generally agreed upon syntax, like a language, that anyone is free to use to "communicate" value to each other, just like a language. So one ca fall apart just as organizations often do, and the other can't, just as languages can't unless they are forgotten. That's really the entire point.

Not too well. If the market gives a bunch of people different deposit addresses, and then sends their combined income for the day to another address (into cold storage for example), all those addresses will be used in the same transaction as being spent from, linking them all together (CoinJoin is what breaks this assumption). The main worry is that if the market is ever taken down, and its address list is exposed by some authority, they will be able to know all the addresses that send money to that market. Then it's just a matter of finding out whom those addresses belong to, and they can just ask Coinbase/Circle for some of that info.
Also, please check this  There is a way to  track at least some of the addresses from various markets.

Um, yeah, there is no way to post your private information publicly, and expect it to be private. No matter what that information is.


No you don't. A non-rooted android or an account at something like Greenaddress is enough. With ARM TrustZone support coming out next year, you'll be able to use the specialized hardware available in almost any Android, and be as safe as using a Trezor.


That's not traditionally or historically true. Governments try to preserve **control** over it while exploiting it for everything they can, and then only try to preserve its value as it's crashing and burning. Like Russia, Argentina, and Venezuela are doing now.


LocalTrader, LocalBitcoin, bitcoin ATMs that are rolling out. You can use bitcoin to buy groceries, household items, home improvement stuff, large appliances, car services and gas, cell phone service, most bills, and anything from Amazon. So although the number of merchants is small, at least in US you can buy everything you need.


Why do you think that? Why would it be easier for the cryptocurrency infrastructure, including all the software, hardware, business support, business accounts, and private holdings to move to BetterCoin, instead of using Bitcoin's open source architecture to simply include whatever benefits BetterCoin has in a hard fork that merely requires a software update on the software and hardware already out there?


If they don't, why do they still hold their coins, are buying more, and are still dumping so much money into their bitcoin projects? Bitcoin can't remain at the current price for ever, so either it will keep going down to 0, or it will go to above what they invested at. Obviously they think it won't go down to 0

Credit cards let you borrow money, whereas bitcoin is more like a checking/savings account. So you still get a benefit from VISA that you can't get from bitcoin (spending money you don't have). As for the inconvenience and flier miles, Coinbase makes it as easy as opening and using a PayPal account (just deposit and withdraw money in and out of bitcoin directly out of your checking account), and then use Gyft to get 3% cash back on purchases from tons of places, or Purse.io to get 6% cash back for shopping on Amazon, and use fee 2-day Prime shipping (even if you don't have a Prime subscription yourself). Ask him if any card he owns gives him 6% cash back for Amazon.

Typically the stored job is on your computer's queue, not inside your printer. Some printers let you store a job from your computer in your printer's memory, such as if you need to walk across the office to the printer and print it out when you are actually there, however that info is in the printer's RAM, and will disappear if you reset it. Most printers only store the metadata of what was printed, such as who, when, and the file name. Only the more expensive and large office printers actually have hard drive to store full contents of what was printer. Just knowing that your printer printed "key123.jog" isn't going to compromise you. And finally, when you print from a USB or flash card, the printer typically reads as it prints, meaning it doesn't download the image to it's own storage and then prints from that, but rather reads the image directly off the flash card as it needs the data to print. So none of the contents actually get written to the printer itself.

Purse.io told me that many people receive Amazon gift cards, or get paid in them for doing some work for Amazon (Mechanical Turk?), and selling cards for cash on a legit market gets you maybe 75% of its value.

I was specifically expressing the fact that for 99.99999% of the economy, if they want to get bitcoins, the need dollars/fiat first, which they can then convert through an exchange. Right now that means using your bank account with all it's annoyances and restrictions, and a centralized exchange with all its trust issues. If the fiat was unhinged and made more liquid, even a little bit, it would make converting from current to bitcoin economy much easier.
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:08:09
That's kind of the annoyance, one you have to plan ahead and hope you have enough money ahead of time, the other you just pay right then. As for online, doing banking online during off hours doesn't actually do most of the bank things until the bank opens the next day. It just queues it up in the system.
BTW, here in US, external, i.e. from your bank to some other bank, takes two to three business days. That means if you make a transfer on Wednesday afternoon, the other person may not get the money until Monday, 5 days later. Longer if Monday or Friday is a holiday.

Currency transactions over the internet are practically done manually, where one party has to contact the other to do the transfer on behalf of the two people actually transacting. Email and bitcoin is a "push" system, while sending internet money is a "pull" system. This is the equivalent to our current money transfer system, if we did the following for sending e-mail:
1. You write your e-mail and stick it into your outbox.
2. You send your login and password to the e-mail recipient.
3. Person receiving e-mail notifies their e-mail provider, who gets a copy of your login and password as well.
4. The recipient's email provider **logs into your e-mail account and rummages through your outbox folder** looking for the email intended for the recipient.
5. Once the recipient's e-mail provider finds it, they contacts your email provider, and ask them to let them download that e-mail.
6. You e-mail provider confirms the download, your recipient's e-mail provider downloads that e-mail, and notifies your recipient that they now have the e-mail in their inbox (anywhere between 1 and 3 days later).
Obviously, using such a system for e-mail in a digital world would be INSANE, instead of simply sending the email directly from one account to another, but that's how the standard internet currency transactions work.

Uh, Satoshi pretty much envisioned that eventually nodes and miners will be few and large, but that they will still have the incentive to work with the system, rather than against it. Even if there are just three super-nodes and three mining pools, it will still be fine, since people can use one to verify the other, and block whichever one misbehaves. So Satoshi's ideal is going pretty much as he planned..
The issue I still have with POS is that it's designed to build up to a 51% attack (those with money make more money, until they can have enough to have majority stake), and if there is a 51% in POW, someone else can buy miners and bring that 51% down, but if there is a 51% in POS, the only thing you can do is  buy coins from the 51% majority holder, and he may not be selling. Basically, POS makes mining and security much more decentralized tan POS, and POS is pretty much what we have with the Federal Reserve i.e. POS majority holder will still have incentive to inflate his wealth away, because, like central banks and governments, he can create money out of nothing, use it to buy physical assets and others can't do a thing about it because he's the majority control.

Volatility has been decreasing as bitcoin's market cap increases. It's actually tiny compared to what it was two years ago, when movements of 5% to 10% EVERY DAY was normal. As bitcoin adoption keeps growing, and its market cap keeps growing, volatility will keep shrinking, since it would take much more value traded on the market to change the price, and since there will be many more traders, including bots, trading it constantly on larger exchanges, absorbing any price movements. Plus, if bitcoin should become the main used currency, its volatility will be cut even further by "sticky prices," where prices of goods on store shelves and in contract trades will get locked simply because they are a pain to have to constantly change. If bread costs the equivalent of 1mBTC one day and 1.1mBTC the next, the store will still show it at 1mBTC, and you won't see the volatility, just like you are not seeing the constant volatility of USD and EUR except if you compare them to things outside of your country.

The main feature of a side chain is being able to lock a bitcoin with a scripted transaction in a way that it can't be unlocked until another chain releases it. That's how you move bitcoins in and out of sidechains. Merge mining is just one way to instantly securing a side chain with enormous hashing power, but there's nothing stopping someone from creating a side chain that's secured by scrypt or any other hashing algorithm. The only difference between scrypt altcoins and a scrypt side chain will be that the coins on the scrypt side chain will still be pegged 1-to-1 to bitcoin (and effectively be bitcoin).

Bitcoin is also a transaction mechanism, like credit cards, and a lot of milenials use credit cards like bank cards, paying off their balance monthly, just so they can get the  cash back rewards, so in that sense the only difference is pre-pay with bitcoin, or post-pay with credit cards. And yes, credit cards can support bitcoin in the future.

Some places don't cover you if your debit card is stolen and used. Some don't have insurance. If your private info is stolen (identity theft), there's a good chance you can lose a lot from your bank and not get it back. People in places like Cyprus, Argentina, and Ukraine lost or are losing a lot of money to central banks and politicians through inflation, corruption, or direct confiscation.


Not at all. VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, and such others are only accepted in North America, most of Europe, Australia, and some parts of South America and Asia. Vast majority of people in the world don't have access to use those services, either because they have no banking infrastructure, or because their countries are deemed "too risky." For instance, if you reside in India or Russia, paying someone else residing there using those methods is easy, but paying someone outside of those countries is banned. So don't be surprised if you travel there with your MasterCard, and it gets declined.


That's not an inherent shortcoming of bitcoin, but rather its currently low adoption rate. You can fix it by getting more people to accept bitcoin, or accepting it yourself. I.e. this will get better with time.


Less, but why does it matter? A bank owning a lot is bad, especially if it's a central bank, because they can use it to make more, at everyone else's expense. The most Satoshi can do it give it to someone else in exchange for goods.


Upgraded means less bugs. There are more bugs in the financial system than in bitcoin. It's why we need things like FDIC and expensive fraud protection charged by credit cards.




This is the same difference between landline telephones and the internet. Landline phones were entirely owned and controlled by telephone companies. If you wanted to use their system or innovate on top of it, you needed their permission, along with lots of licenses and regulatory approvals. It's because of this that ALL the innovation in telephones for almost 100 years consisted of edge cases, like answering machines and cordless phones. Internet, on the other hand, is open to anyone to innovate on top of. No permission needed; as long as you are willing to learn the software and take the time to create something, you can do it. And so, in 20 years we ended up with email, Skype/VOIP, Facebook, YouTube, etc etc etc. We probably did more innovation on the internet in 2 years than we did in 80 with phone lines. Bitcoin is the same compared to traditional banking systems. If you want to innovate with a financial system, you have to ask their permission, get tons of licences and regulatory approvals, etc. And so, in the last 60+ years, our financial innovation basically consisted of web banking, devices like Square, and services like PayPal and Dwolla. All edge cases that don't change anything about how the internals work. Bitcoin in just the last 3 years had auto trading bots, tip bots, proof of existence, decentralized securities, merchant protocol, multisignature transactions, distributed security vaults, and probably lots of other things I'm forgetting. In short, bitcoin can innovate at least 10 times faster than the financial system can, because anyone can pick it up and do things with it.

They wouldn't save up for a home. They would rent. Like people should, so if the economy in some area declines, they can move. Let real estate investors deal with figuring out where to invest, and absorb losses if the housing market or local economy drops.
Considering car loans are only 5 years long, I'm sure borrowing in a deflationary currency won't be too much of a problem. But, again, one large vehicle per driver on the road is HORRIBLY inefficient and overly expensive. Public transportation is so much better in that regard. You don't even really need a car in most places in Europe, and still be OK.
Joe Average would start a business the same way he does now, either small out-of-pocket, or with the help of wealthy investors. Downside for him is that investors will be very careful to only invest in businesses that make them money above the rate of deflation, as opposed to investing in whatever they can, since a -2% return is still better than just holding cash.
In short, people will buy what they need to buy, and people who actually know about investing will be investing. We'll have a much more careful, considerate, and less wasteful world.

It didn't actually crash, but MtGox, which at the time was still using the original Magic the Gathering trading engine, was hacked. Apparently the guy who created it and sold it to Mark Karpeles had a password security issue in the software. The hacker logged into Gox with administrative privileges, created millions of fake bitcoins on their internal accounting system, and sold them all, causing the price on the Gox market to crash to $0.01. He did that because Gox had a limit on withdrawals of something like $1,000 a day, and causing bitcoins to crash in price would have allowed him to pull out more coins. I think in the end he stole something like $12k or something. After that happened, Gox had to shut down for about two weeks, scrapped all its software, rewrote all their exchange software from scratch (thus there is no more Magic the Gathering anything left in there, besides the name) and rolled back all the exchange trades that happened during the hack (which people who bought coins for $0.10 were really pissed about). They also absorbed the theft and paid for it out of their own funds.

* They use generic off the shelf parts, swapping of which will only raise costs and suspicions
* They use multiple sources of entropy, including reading memory state directly and checking that it's getting enough entropy (nearly impossible to backdoor, unlike RNG chips), and let you add your own "salt" to it using whatever source you want
* Firmware will be signed and easily verified
* We will randomly check manufactured devices to make sure they contain what we want them to contain
So Entropys will be very difficult and expensive to compromise without anyone finding out, and even if they are compromised, adding your own salt still makes the compromise useless.

No, other phone apps make your phone an SPV client, meaning all it can do is connect to a few random other nodes, and request information about your address from them. When it sends, it broadcasts your transaction to those few random nodes, but has no idea whether it can trust them (whether they will rebroadcast it), or how much they have rebroadcast them. The only way to actually run a real full node at home is to run Bitcoin-QT.

Yes, blockchain generates and stores the private key for you. When you use blockchain to create backups, what you are backing up is your private keys. Blockchain, and other wallets typically never show private keys, because anyone seeing them (and taking a picture or a screenshot) will get complete access to all your coins in that address.

Uh, I haven't looked at their website closely enough, but that is nothing at all what they claim they are working on. In short, all modern ARM processors come with Trusted Computing architecture in the chip, which allows you to execute code, store things in ram, and do I/O (screen and keyboard) on a completely separate processing layer, which is effectively the same as running that code on a totally separate hardware device, despite it being within the same processor. However, Android and phone makers do not have any software drivers for that system, and sometimes even disable it. Rivetz is mainly working on developing drivers for that Trusted Computing platform, and an API to allow you to load code into that separate protected area and communicate with it using a secure channel. My guess is they plan to sell or license the drivers. There is nothing about web based identities, or creating a privacy extension that will keep your phone private from advertisers. Their goal is entirely to execute some small portions of code (cryptographic signing) in a separate protected section of the chip that the rest of the OS and system has absolutely no connection to beyond basic API codes. A section of the chip that most of us have in our phones but never use, and which have no back doors into them, since they are separated in hardware, not software like the main OS. Just like a Trezor executes things within its own separate system, with only a basic API interface over USB.
They really need to advertise and explain their stuff better, but they seem to mostly be composed of extremely security conscious crypto-nerds with no real regard for that kind of stuff (especially the guys I talked to at conferences).

HD wallets "tumble" by sending change to a newly created address. I.e. if someone knows that an address is yours, and you send money from it, it will go to two addresses, one the person you are sending to, and another being your change address. To anyone looking at the blockchain, they won't know which of those addresses is yours.
In this particular case, Circle knows your address you withdrew to, and market address may be known, especially if it gets busted. So there is a clear link from your circle account, to your address, to a possibly known market address, and subtract them all and your change address is known as well. To do any sort of tumbling with HD, you would have to send at least a few random transactions to yourself. Then at least you could claim that those coins were sent to someone else. But it's still not guaranteed, or the best way. Wait until Mycelium implements CoinJoin to do true tumbling, and for now use something like DarkWallet (which uses CoinJoin), an actual tumbling service, or as a last resort the blockchain.info tumbler. I don't shop at markets, but for privacy I create a throwaway addres on blockchain.info wallet, send money there, send it through their tumbler back to my wallet, and delete the address after I'm done.

First, how have those currencies **not** adapted to the digital age? They are already 95% digital, stored on computers as account balances. There is also no sense in using blokchain technology for them, since some single specific entity is backing them, in which case that single specific entity might as well run the single specific server to keep track of all of them. Which is sort of how things work already. Besides, one of bitcoin's advantages is **specifically** decentralization, being neutral and not being dependent on any political body (think China will ever adopt the USD?), and being able to ignore regulations and currency controls (such as exporting money to, or paying for goods from, overseas in places like Argetina, Iran, China, Russia, etc.). As some crappy little country's crappy little currency fails, and their only financial systems are banks or bitcoins (remember, even if you have dollars, you still have to use your country's banks to "digitize" them), people will gravitate towards bitcoin to secure their wealth and "untie" it from government's grasp. The more that happens, the more people will get used to the whole "decentralized, apolitical money" idea.
Second, when you say "will never entirely replace existing currencies" you are in effect saying "the existing currencies will never fail, and no one will ever need to look for alternatives." Or that "people will trust another government currency, after their own government completely fails them." I'm not sure that either of those statements are very probable, since even the US dollar has only existed in its current form for only 50 years.


Let's not ignore it, and say that everyone will get automatic raises with deflation, and will likely have to either perform harder to keep their job, or it will become common practice to have yearly contracts, with the employees negotiating to maintain or only sightly decrease their salaries every year. Yes, less productive people will be in trouble. Boo-hoo?


I'm not a fan of credit for personal home use. It has created WAY more problems than it's worth, and made a ton of people dependent on social programs and their banks. I also believe it has built up the economy to the present levels entirely on future promises, which, when they get broken, will case A LOT of hurt. Someone has to pick up the check on all that spending (watch it be banks, that get bailouts from government, which can't afford them due to declining tax revenues, which results in more EQ's, and everyone paying even more through inflation, which HOPEFULLY won't scare international investors away, otherwise we'll come to a sudden point where our entire budget has to have surpluses, and everything that can be cut will have to be cut instantly).
If you are referring to short term business credit, like "get now, pay in 30 days," then if bitcoin's annual deflation is 3%, then the business will have to tack on another 0.25% on top of whatever the supplier charges for the short term loan. If it is a long term credit, then it can be paid back with the deflation taken into account, most likely with larger nominal amount during the fist payment periods, and decreasing amounts towards the last periods, where the real value of each payment remains the same. And if by "credit" you mean "investment" into a company, then I guess investors will have to make sure that whatever they invest in is actually profitable. In short, **just as inflation is taken into account and priced into goods and loans, deflation will also be taken into account and priced into goods and loans.** The end result will be that many more things will be paid for with savings instead of loans, and, most importantly, only thing that are actually worth investing in will be created and sold. None of that cheap Chinese crap that burns up tons of resources and fills our landfills, created only because a 2% profit loss is STILL better than the 3% inflation if the money was just held (i.e. I believe inflationary currencies have also been one of the major reasons for the massive amounts of pollution over the last century).


I don't hate debt, I hate incentives for irrational debt. Credit is **not** a creation of wealth, it is the borrowing of wealth against future promises. It only works if you believe that wealth will be for ever created in the future. Which may be true, but at the long-term economic growth level (i.e. something like GDP, close to 3.5%), NOT at the crazy high levels we borrow at (average of 6%+). If the credit that is building economies outpaces the actual growth of the economy, you end up with hyperinflation and country collapse, as has happened over and over and over in our civilization's history.


I don't imagine that bitcoin will grow at 10x every year, since that is impossible in the long term (eventually everyone who can adopt it, will), so I don't have to imagine such a thing.


No such ting as bank runs in a 100% reserve bank. Everyone who runs to that bank will get all their money back. Likewise, no such thing as bank runs when you don't have to rely on a bank to secure your money (use hardware wallets, split keys, or multisignature addresses, where the "bank" just verifies that you are the one spending the money, and cosigns the transaction). Also, it would be AWESOME if "savings banks" as we know them now were actually called what they actually are: investment accounts. And people could actually make an informed decision to either put their money into a actual savings bank, or to risk it and put it into an investment account.
And finally, as I mentioned, wealth can't be created out of thin air. Where do you think all that "lending of last resort" that central banks do comes from? It comes from all of us through borrowing and later taxation, or massive inflation. Because some banks gambled with people's money, or because people put their money into shitty banks without bothering to do due diligence, EVERYONE has to pay for their stupidity. No thank you.


Why do you think that we think inflation is inherently bad? What is it that you think we think inflation does exactly?


3% official rate, and closer to 6% unofficial rate, is pretty crap. Means even if you are lucky to get a 3% raise every year, you're still worse off... Plus all that waste and pollution I mentioned...


That's why I asked what I asked. What is it that you think WE think and believe? There's a good chance that your beliefs of what we think are based on what the general, oversimplified, mass media reporting has told you, and that may or may not be why we actually don't like the fed. I want to compare what you believe about us to what we actually believe.

Bitcoin is cash. Not a liability account at a bank. Will anyone in EU cover you if you lose some € paper notes?


Good for you. It just means that bitcoin is needed for 6,000,000,000 other people, but not you specifically. Congratulations on living in one of the few countries that don't have issues, and being part of the wealthy class that qualifies for a MasterCard (even in USA there are tons of people who can't get a credit card, or even a bank account, because they are too poor and too risky).


You don't need an internet connection to use bitcoin. Bitcoin relies of information transfer, not specifically internet. You can transfer it using SMS text (Coinapult), or even just by picking up the phone and calling someone with access to the Blockchain and reading off the transaction characters. You can even just mail your transaction by post. Signed transaction that doesn't expose your private keys.


* Buy bitcoins, use them to buy something else right away, and get a 3% to 10% discount from merchants. That way you're using it as a money transfer system, and neither of you is affected by price fluctuations.
* If you live in a country that doesn't use $, €, £, or ¥, there's a REALLY high chance that your currency fluctuates even more that Bitcoin, typically in the downward direction.
* If you are worried about relatives coming after your wealth, you can use it to stay anonymous when you transact.
* You can use it to pay for things that may be banned in your country, like gambling, porn, VPN service, or in some cases even a blogging site
* If you are wealthy, it is much more convenient to have your wealth in bitcoin, mobile and moving with you wherever you go, instead of it being stuck in some country's bank, where your every move is tracked and your every transaction scrutinized (it's like varying a secret duffel bag of cash).
* And, finally, it is the ultimate off shore account / tax shelter, more secure and more liquid than anything you can find on some Caribbean island.


There's no evidence that he still has the private keys to them, but why would he crash the value of his own holdings by dumping? If he's smart, and it's obvious he is, he would sell slowly so as not to crash the market. And even if he were to dump everything at once and cause the market to collapse, so what? It just means that all those bitcoins are now distributed throughout the market. It doesn't mean bitcoin is any less useful or valuable for what it does. The market will just rebound, because " price will go up" is not why people are investing in it.


The only way the core mechanism will get changed is to fix bugs. More features usually means more secure way of doing things. For example, plain address to address transactions vs multisignature transactions. The later made things way more secure. Also, look up the definition of antifragile. That's what bitcoin is.


Unless your bank is a charity that donates money for your well being... Yes you do. Banks pay for insurance (like FDIC in USA) through fees they charge you, and investments they make off your money (imagine if you let me control your rental property that rents for $600 a month, I rented it out for you, and every month gave you $550 and a pizza. Is that pizzas free?). As for fraud protection on credit cards, merchants pay for that in the form of 3% fees, which they then charge you by increasing prices on everything in the store. Wealth/money is like energy - it can not be created out of thin air. Someone has to create or pay for it. In regards to fraud protection, ultimately, all the money to cover it comes from you.


That is mostly true for 1st world, but there is a whole lot of third world out there where it is broken. Or nonexistent. And even if things do work well, the efficiencies and features afforded by bitcoin are like internet and email over phones and post office. Phones and post worked perfectly fine, but a superior system was simply more convenient, and eventually took over. Don't forget, when email first started out, it cost about $10 an hour to use, and practically no one had it, as opposed to faxes that were cheap and plentiful.


Lycos is a business, and closed source. Bitcoin is more like Unix (which evolved into Linux), or TCI/IP (which beat out the proprietary Novel NetWare). Whatever new thing someone may come up with, if it's good enough, it will just be implemented in bitcoin. That, plus Network Effects, will almost guarantee that it will be the only one to survive.

That's my point, cash **is not digital money that runs over networks**. 
When I send a bitcoin from my wallet to yours, the entire process is automatic, and the money moves directly from my account to yours.
When I send a dollar from my account to yours, I make a request on my bank's system, that request is manually checked and approved by a person, another person submits that request to the ACH system, someone at the ACH receives the request and notifies your bank, another person at your bank receives and verifies the transfer to your account and adjusts your balance, and after a few days when everyone confirm everything, the money is available in your account. The system is extremely analog and laborious in the background. It just looks digital because the money manually moved is in the form of account balances on digital ledgers.

Why would a bunch of orphaned blocks be a problem for users? Miners would complain, but they would notice that some pool is apparently getting 51%+ of the blocks and keeps orphaning everyone. Just keep an ete at this  and you'll know.
Setting up a bunch of fake subsidiary pools and using them to hide the fact that you have 51% power is an interesting idea though. But if one of your pools does an actual attack, and the rest of your pools go along with it, mining its block and continuing to support its attack, they would be accused of supporting the attacker, which isn't that much better than being accused of carrying out the attack yourself.
Yes, there are plenty of ways to hide your tracks, at least temporarily, and plenty of ways to perform the attack, also temporarily, but it won't destroy bitcoin, and is unlikely to do much damage at all. The entire network might go down for a day or two while we all figure out what to do, and some people may lose money by selling things and never being paid, but once the solution (one of very many already available) is picked, the network will just be started up again and continue as usual, being more resilient and trusted than before. It wouldn't be the first time something that major happened. Or the second.

So, as long as merchants have to pay their suppliers in USD, they will use USD prices. Once 50%+ of suppliers and customers accept bitcoin directly, it will be irrelevant as to which currency the prices are pegged to, and people can switch.

Memorize (New - Old) divided by Old. The calculation order used to get me too, until I finally got that down. Something decreasing by 3x would be ⅓ being the New price, 1 being the Old price, and thus (⅓ - 1) ÷ 1 = -66.6%

Nah. PCs run all applications using shared resources and in shared memory, meaning typically all apps have access to all files and all memory contents (they are just starting to sandbox things a bit now). Androids on the other hand actually run a virtual machine (emulated, completely separate instance) for every app, with each app having completely segregates data storage and memory space that no other apps have access to. Especially important if that data storage or memory space has private keys.

Quote by putting a &gt; symbol in front of the text.
I agree that someone with a 51% creating an invalid block with inflation will have their block rejected by all the other miners, nodes, and wallets. What will happen is their mining work will be ignored by the network, and the network will think the hash rate just decreased by 51%, with the remaining 49% picking up the slack and becoming the new 100%.
How will that process work in Proof of Stake? Will the 51% stake be ignored, and the people who have less stake (49%) will pick up the slack to become the new 100% stake?


Why would it be toast? The coins will still be there, everyone will still own the same amount, the transaction signing will be the same, the only thing that will change is the proof of work hash. Yes, it will cause the value to crash for a while, but it will basically be the equivalent of the network freezing for a day or two, and then resuming operation as normal.

The fact that they were auditing, and that a simple audit of Private Account Balance v.s. Blockchain Address Balance would take an hour or two at best, just opens up more questions in my opinion.

They submitted their app almost two years ago, and it was initially rejected. They spent the time to challenge that rejection and explain what the app did. The second time the app was approved. However, once new apps by other companies started to get rejected, either right away, or within a week, they didn't want to make any updates, because every time an app is updated, it has to be reviewed again. The first app was reviewed and approved, so they didn't want to risk having subsequent reviews rejecting their app.
Bottom line is, the app was reviewed, twice, approved, and was out for almost two years, with lots of downloads. There was no reason for Apple to get rid of it unless they simply changed their minds, rules be damned.

They could also be using that currency, but not in such large amounts.

Nope. HD wallets already do a lot of the anonymization, and CoinJoin is planned to be implemented as an automatic default by a few wallets already. People will be laundering without even knowing it.


I doubt that will help authorities. So someone bought a $300 TV from Overstock. That's a tiny fraction of someone's annual expenditures. I guess they can subpoena every business, and match up every name and address, but that would piss off every business, waste hundreds of millions, and will just cause people to use different names for ordering. It's not like they have to order with the same name as on their credit card.


Yeah, you're right. Good thing you can order under any name with gift cards. "Oh, that guy? He used to live here, but he moved out"


If you run a large corporation correctly, you shouldn't be paying any taxes. What you are paying you'd be paying for favors, such as regulatory protections that keep little guys out. I'm pretty sure if everyone suddenly started getting subpoenas, there would be a considerable amount of protest (or corruption), and it would be a waste anyway.


Doesn't matter. Once Rivetz comes out with their API, every Android wallet will be as secure as a Trezor, and a lot of people buy Androids. It's why I haven't bothered buying a Trezor myself.


People with hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars worth of bitcoin wealth, who also want to stay mobile, yes. That's what they are doing now. I can only imagine this getting even easier in the future.


Nope, that proprietary code doesn't have access to any part of your phone other than the secure excrted channel between it and your wallet app. So all it can do it ask you to verify, and if confirmed, sign bitcoin transactions, which it would have to send back to your wallet app. Your app will be the one that will broadcast it, and those are open source.


As I mentioned, there will be no difference between anonymous laundered transactions and what you have now. In the future (hopefully within 2015), the same act of scanning a QR code and hitting send, as you do now, will automatically establish a Tor connection, broadcast a CoinJoin intent, join a mixing transaction, and within a second or two sign the final mixed transaction, sending change to a brand new address. The user won't even notice the difference.

Competition. Right now there is none, so the ATM can charge whatever it wants as long as it doesn't go into the level of "obscene." Nice thing about bitcoin is that anyone else can set up an ATM, charge lower fees, and it will work just as well. With more and more of them coming out, competition will drive prices down. Now, imagine seeing your bank's ATM charging a 2% fee or £1.50, and trying to undercut their business by setting up your own ATM that still works with that bank, but charges £1.00?

Hi. Mycelium here.
Mycelium servers are only used to give you your bitcoin address balance, broadcast your transactions to the network, and handle LocalTrader stuff. Your private keys are never sent to our server, and we try our best to get you to make backups at home. So as long as you have a backup of your private keys, you should be ok should anything happen to our servers. Once HD wallets come out, we will support the 12 word BIP39 standard, which is the same backup method used by Trezor, Darkwallet, and Electrum. As long as you have those 12 words written down somewhere, you can always restore your backup on any other wallet that supports that standard.
The main risks of using a centralized server like ours is that we can lie about the address balance in your account, telling you you have more or less than you actually have, or prevent you from being able to broadcast transactions. The first one won't actually do anything other than confuse your wallet, since you won't be able to send transactions with money you don't actually have, and for the second we would have to actually know who you are and your IP number to block you. Right now we don't keep track of IP numbers, and once we move to Tor, that will be completely impossible.

Yes, it can be, but crypto isn't being adopted, unfortunately, because people think things are good enough as is. Bitcoin is being adopted because of its bitcoin properties, and in effect is forcing people to adopt crypto, so devs are just expanding that crypto to do the same functions the other crypto did. Plus there's more focus on usability, convenience, and security with bitcoin crypto (backups, hardware devices, easy to use phone apps, etc.) 
I think its similar to how mesh networking tech is widely available but not used by anyone, but it can be more widely adopted with implementation of bitcoin micro channel transactions, or by it being the default thing built into the already usable bitcoin in Bitcoincard.

I didn't even think about the liability part of it. Bitcoin makes opening an account that can send and receive money SO much easier and faster than going through a bank...
Don't all those other services charge both, a percent (like 3%) AND a fixed amount (like $0.30)? That's definitely true for credit cards. Plus you're limiting people to only the services you yourself use. Which is one of the biggest benefits of bitcoin. Imagine if having an AT&amp;T cell phone provider only let you call other AT&amp;T customers, and you also needed a T-mobile phone to call your T-mobile friends, and a Verizon phone to call your Verizon friends. Likewise, both merchant and customer have to use the same payment system, even if that system is a total ripoff for the merchant. Bitcoin is just an intermediary that any service can run on top of, and if Coinbase starts charging too high fees, the merchant can switch to BitPay and still accept payments from the same customers. Plus, just accepting bitcoin is so much easier than accepting PayPal, Dwolla, VISA, MasterCard, AmEx, and Discover. All of which aren't even accepted in most of the world (even in places like India and Russia) so either the person wanting to tip, or person receiving the tip, will be excluded. 
Re: Mesh Network
Note how we have such awesome granular counting and tracking of packets... but moving and tracking our money is almost manual. The best we can do with the money part of it is rely on prepaid accounts, and then count the account changes separately on our own system. Why do we need all this counting of packets, if we can just do what we do with the money: have the user preload the list of things on the web they want to see or download, then charge them a few bucks, and then send them all that digital stuff as a single huge packet or compressed file? If it works for money... Or is being able to do with money what you can do with packets actually an improvement ;)
Yes, I know about computers. I know mesh networking hardware and software has been out for years. Yet adoption is almost nonexistent, for the reason I mentioned. I think what you are taking about at Fortune 500 companies is either distributed WiFi access points for their own internet, or them buying data access at packet level from an internet provider. I've never heard of Fortune 500 companies actually sharing internet access between them (especially since their office are nowhere near each other). As for mesh networks in neighborhoods, are you really willing to prepay your neighbors for data, or give them your credit card info so they can charge you when you use it? Would a random passer buy trust you enough to prepay and have you hold his money, or give you his credit card info without even meeting you?
And that's the other major benefit of bitcoin. It's security is radically different from the banking system, where you can safely share your "receive to" payment information for bitcoin, while there's a huge risk in doing that for credit cards and bank accounts.

Not everyone is a visionary and can see technological potential and threats. Unix was morphed into open source Linux, which is still based on unix. Bitcoin 1.0 and then bitcoin 2.0 will still be based on bitcoin. Don't forget that abandoning an old Unix install in favor of installing Linux costs nothing, while abandoning bitcoin in favor of some alt coin means abandoning actual money. Imagine if Facebook had tokens that could be used to buy things online, they only worked on Facebook and couldn't be transfered to other platforms, and you had $100 worth of those tokens in your account. How quickly would you switch to a new and technologicaly improved social media competitor if it meant you had to abandon your Facebook account and the money in it? My guess is you wouldn't. Obviously any technological improvements to blockchain tech will involve attempts to move as much of the old currency on to the new technology as possible.
I have never ever in my life received a PayPal transaction that was ready to be spent in less than a day. It takes one to two days for it to clear from the sender's account, during which it's an IOU from PayPal, and at least two or three days to transfer it into my bank account so I can spend it. Do you understand the concept of settlement? Since apparently not, settlement in finances is when money transfer is actually complete, and is no longer supported by IOU promises. Here's a comparison:
* I send transaction
* You receive confirmation that I have enough money, and have an IOU from me that you will get it. Time: 2 seconds
* Money transfer is complete (financial transaction is settled) and you are free to spend it. Time: 10 minutes to an hour
**Fiat (PayPal or whatever)**
* I send transaction
* You receive confirmation that I have enough money, and have an IOU from me that you will get it. Time: 2 seconds
* Money transfer is complete (financial transaction is settled) and you are free to spend it. Time: 2 days to a week.
Until the transaction is settled, when you spend your PayPal money, you are spending PayPal IOUs, not actual assets, while the actual money is stuck in the transfer, slowly moving from my bank to yours. Does this make sense? Now compare this to financial transactions that happen between businesses, especially internationally. 
* I send transaction totaling a few hundred thousand dollars
* You receive confirmation that I have enough money, and DON'T EVEN GET AN IOU to spend elsewhere. Large amounts are not backed by bank IOUs like tiny personal amounts.
* Money transfer is complete (financial transaction is settled) and you are free to spend it. Time: one to two weeks!
Bitcoin is still 10 minutes to an hour. Definitely money of the future. I can't believe how you morons can't even understand that. In your all's eyes, "Because I have a credit card, all the world's finances are covered!"

1) The wallet supports only one seed at a time, so you would have to wipe the app data to have it ask you to import another one.
2) No. You can only spend from multiple addresses if they are all a part of the same HD account.
3) Not at this time. That would have to be done manually in the database, and all prior trade data (except for number of trades) would be lost, since it is encrypted with your private key.

Yes, and yes. Do not use this on large office printers and copiers. Only on home printers. The cheaper printer the better, since they only store things in memory, and the cheaper ones only store metadata. A lot of printers also don't even load things to memory when printing from USB, reading and printing directly off the USB drive. Also it's best to disconnect your printer from your computer/network, and cycle the power when you're done to clear its memory. We may eventually add a way to encrypt the key it creates with a password saved in a text file on the device, so your printer won't be able to see the raw private key.

Since you didn't look it up, a corporation is specifically a limited liability entity that is allowed to have many of the rights that a person has. The liability protection is given to it by a government, enforced by government courts, and ditto for the rights. In a stateless society, there would be no corporations. Instead businesses would be owned by private owners, and those vowners would have full liability for their business's actions. So, if a corporation accidentally blows something up, the most that can happen is the corporation losses their money, but none of the corporate owners are liable for anything that blowup damaged. The courts will not allow you to sue them, and the police will not allow you to extort anything from them. With a privately owned business, all the owners will be liable, and will have to pay for any damage out of their own pockets. No courts or cops will protect them from having their stuff and house taken from them if needed.
If you are anti corporations, you really should be pro anarchy and anti government too.

Because Satoshi never claimed it was? (The ONLY place I have ever heard that "it's just an experiment" was on somethingawful, and I guess now here) Also, because everyone who supported and developed it did so with the idea that this new invention is "it," and must be built up to work the way Satoshi and other early devs envisioned. And because everyone working on it since the beginning understands that this is an open source protocol, and there is no point in creating a competing protocol just to design improvements, when those improvements can just be implemented in the already working and adopted system.
By the same account, you could say that the internet was just an experiment. It succeeded, and we still have the internet. Claiming that "bitcoin is just an experiment," with the implication that it is flawed and shouldn't be attempted to be used as a replacement for money, is just a last resort excuse made up by bitcoin detractors to continue to push the idea that bitcoin shouldn't be used, after all their previous objections to it have been shot down.

The TrustZone that's built into all new ARM chips that power your phone is pretty much a separate device from the phone itself. There is no way for the phone to gain access to it other than through a single signed encrypted channel, at which point the device will ask for confirmation every time. It's not integrated into the phone OS in any way, and there's no way for the OS to peek into it without going through that single protected channel. TrustZone even has protected display and protected input, completely separate from your OS, so it can't be spoofed by some malicious phone software. It's no different than a Trezor connected through USB.

They don't have to beg, since miners are on top of this, and they are the ones in control, not mining pools, so this is just unnecessary FUD, but the system worked for the last five years with dozens of times being close to 50%, so the system works apparently.

An address is a result of a function with the private key being one of the inputs. So,
Address = PrivKey * SomeFunction
and it's set up so that you can always get the Address if you have the PrivKey, but you can't get the PrivKey from the Address and SomeFunction alone. I believe it works using remainders, so, like, 3 could be the remainder for 13 / 10, but you have no idea what the number 13 is if all you have is the remainder 3, since it can be 13, 23, 33, etc. I don't know cryptography enough to give you the full answer.
Using the PrivKey and a different function you can also create a signature for the Address, and anyone can verify that the signature and the Address came from the same PrivKey, without being able to know what the PrivKey is. So, the master record, the blockchain, only needs to keep a list of Addresses and their balances. When you send money, all you do is create a transaction saying you are sending some ammount from Address, and add a signature, and everyone will be able to verify that this transaction from this address is indeed signed by whoever owns the PrivKey.
2) Keys are stored either in plain text, or are encrypted with a password.
3) Miner work is basically an agreed-upon algorithm that everyone using the Bitcoin system agrees to abide by. It's basically: Take the hash of the previous block, add unconfirmed transactions, a time stamp, and some random number, and generate a new hash. Keep changing the random number, and adding new transactions if they appear, until the hash (the solution to the SHA256 function) has a specific number of 0's in front of it. The number of 0's is based on the current difficulty level, which is based on how long it took for the previous round of blocks at the previous difficulty level to solve. Everyone has access to all this information, so everyone knows what to mine for, and everyone can agree on whether or not whoever mined the new block followed the rules.

* create user name and password
* register on the site
* spend a few  minutes to give them ALL of your private information
* enter your credit card info and whatever security crap they ask for
and then every time you want to do the Buy With 1-Click thing, enter your password.

If you are just a user, sure. If you are an investor, that will be too late. Look at Facebook's pre-IPO returns 
The crazy wild gains of 1000% that bitcoin had are actually fairly common in stocks. We as a public just aren't aware of them, because those price increases happen before the IPO, when trading in them is restricted to a select few. All we see is post IPO returns, and assume the 6% to 12% steady return is the best stocks do, and wild crazy returns are scams or pyramids. Bitcoin, in a way, was the first time the public as a whole saw what pre-IPO shares do, since there was no one to ban this price information from becoming public, or prevent the public from trading in it.

If by "everybody" you mean "a small fraction of investors who actually look at the whole picture, including inflation, as opposed to just the 10% to %16 market growth," then maybe. I think you're stuck in a bubble, thinking everyone knows these things, while I would guess 95+% of the population doesn't realize this, thinks the market has been doing great, and plan/vote accordingly (I.e. being lied to).


Oh, well, if you're so smart, then you obviously know too.


LOL! Where the hell did you  from? Either you're new here, or you're not involved with bitcoin at all, otherwise you'd know that not only are you in a minority, but bitcoin itself it libertarian. Or more specifically, anarchist XD


Since you're so smart and keep track of many rates and things, I'm sure you already keep track of how many dollars China has been dumping. Pretty sure Russia will be doing the same, what with the whole sanctions thing.


Well, the alternative view is that 2+2=5, and then everything will be just peachy. It's the only way both an increase in interest rates AND an increase in how much US can afford to borrow can add up. Unless you're stupid enough to think that US will actually vote to reduce borrowing (balance the budget), or increase taxes drastically to continue paying for things. Or maybe you're just one of those idiots who thinks that, when it comes to empires and fiat currencies, "this time it will be different."

That kinda suggests my exact statement, that 50% of that QE goes to cover government borrowing money on things.


This part doesn't make sense to me. If I have a house with a mortgage (bond) and QE gives me money to pay off the bond, sure, an illiquid financial asset (mortgage/bond) is replaced by a liquid one (cash), but the house asset still remains. So in a sense, the overall assets of the economy increase by the amount of cash created. Increase in supply of this new asset should still lead to a decrease in its value.

I'm seeing BitPay transitioning into a financial services business already, instead of just a bitcoin exchange. In the future, their services may be used for the same reason that even big companies use payroll companies: they are simply already set up to do all the processing, have the servers to manage it, and can deal with all the technical issues so that the big company doesn't have to bother. Maybe eventually BitPay will even allow companies to export their entire sales and purchasing (including payroll) history, right from the bitcoin blockchain, to eliminate the company's needs for accountants, and provide a standard cookie-cutter accounting and financial reports for anyone who uses their service.

Yes, BIP70, Merchant Protocol. It's already out. Since you can add your own inputs to a signed transaction before broadcasting, and BIP70 has you sign and send the transaction to the merchant t verify before they send it out, merchants can just add their own fees to it, sign it with their key, and broadcast it then (broadcasting it first and then rebroadcasting sends up double-spend warnings). BitPay has already implemented BIP70, but I don't know when they will add the "merchant pays fee" feature.

Why do you think Realcoin is directly competing with bitcoin?? The way I understood the intent of this is to make it easier to get into bitcoin by making the other side of the exchange simpler, which is pretty much what we need to at least help adopt bitcoin, if not promote it.

Sorry, but "Only the first 100k is protected, **and the rest is guaranteed to be taken away**" was not in the rules. "First 100k is protected and the remainder is at the risk of the bank" was. Businesses likely did their research to make sure the banks they kept their money in were sound and well run. The rules were changed on them to where even well run banks are guaranteed to lose them money.


If you are an individual, sure. But that's not the problem businesses have. For them it's a rotating account/amount. E.g.
 "We had $75k paid back to us from that shop selling our merchandize, $90k from this one, and only $35k from that other one. Now we can finally pay those two $10k for the month salaries and repay the $170k we owe to our manufacturer. And hey, we have a $10k profit!"
That $200k that the business owns only exists for the short time before salary and manufacturer checks are cashed. And if the money is yanked away, everyone is screwed. They also can't really use different bank accounts, because that would mean giving different account info to everyone who pays them, possibly writing two checks from two banks to pay people, and if they sell over $100k in a month, they go over the limit anyway.
But key point is, regardless of if it sounds like a lot of money, **it's not their money**

A 51% attack will not be the end of bitcoin, and the effects of this threat are greatly exaggerated. All that such power would allow the attacker to do is mine blocks with no transactions, thus freezing the network (easily fixed by requiring that blocks have at least some transactions), or spend their own money, and then re-spend it again. It won't let them spend or take anyone else's money, and will just make all the money they themselves own much less trustworthy. Should a 51% attacker come out as an overt threat, it's also possible for the rest of the miners and pools to get together and refuse to process or accept the attacker's blocks, effectively making a temporary fork that renders the attacker's blocks worthless, and lowering the difficulty for themselves (it would be as if 51% of the hashing power disappeared from the network). Finally, to pull off such an attack would cost an estimated $1.4 billion dollars worth of investment, would earn you about $1.4 million dollars **a day**, and you'd be shooting yourself in the foot if you threw away $1.4 billion, and a $1.4 minion revenue stream, just to take down bitcoin. Which will still inevitably fail, since, worst case scenario, we just roll back the blockchain a few days, and start again with a differet mining algorithm.

Also, hopefully, things like DarkWallet and CoinJoin will get implemented and distributed fast enough to make the standard transaction method, and will prevent anything like what from being possible to implement.

No, they accept bitcoin. I pay them in bitcoin. They take bitcoin. It is then up to them if they want to convert some or all of it into dollars. Besides, no consumer would would pay in bitcoin if no merchant accepted it. One has to come first. Note that merchants are able to accept it, more and more consumers are starting to use it.


You should've seen the r/xbox subreddit in the last few days :D


Neither did email when we had phones and faxes. I've been using bitcoin almost exclusively for the last 1.5 years. Honestly, it's much more convenient than banks.


Pruning, unlimited size with market determined fees, inverse bloom filters to only send missing transactions instead of whole blocks, offchain transactions, side chains,  and probably some others I'm forgetting.


Time lock transactions, BIP70, side chains, green addresses, mukti-sig with trusted party.


No risks unless upgrades and minor risks since besides miners, no one else is affected on reconciliation. The kind of fork that happened was unusual, because it arose from a bug in the old version, not a newly introduced bug. Unlikely it will happen again.


I'm sure will be figured out and only implemented once it's safe


Sure there is. New features are being tested, and as they become stable enough, are added. Big things being worked on right now is block propagation and pruning.


What it means I'd that if those close equivalents are better, and get thoroughly tested, their improvements will get added into bitcoin. There are $100 million worth of interested wealth in the nearest competitor. There is probably 50 times that amount that is interested in keeping bitcoin going.

In a doublespend, you send someone real bitcoins, not counterfeit ones, and then you reverse the transaction by having it confirm in a different block. The bitcoins are always real, it's the transaction that gets reversed. It is functionality similar to doing a chargeback with a credit card.

It doesn't solve the block time problem, but it might increase the confidence a bit.

Note that Colins was sued, investigated, charged, and prosecuted. Brock wasn't even charged. There is no "civil" rape. It's a crime, prosecuted in government court. And Brock wasn't even investigated, let alone prosecuted. Plus the main charge was statutory rape, i.e. sex with a minor. That wouldn't have applied to Brock anyway.
There is one fluffed up piece of dirt on Brock that marred his character due to the "sex with minors" connotation, and Brock being unfortunately partnered with Colins, who was likely a bit insane and very broken. Ever since, it seems to have been confirmation bias, with people finding every little allegation to point out that "See? He's untrustworthy." Which, considering Brock invests in almost everything and uses his resources (money, skills, connections) to try bail out troubled companies, even ones like MtGox, is very easy to do.

This talks about government debt, not private. Governments can borrow all they want, spend it on anything they want, and then print more money (inflation) to pay off that debt. When they do that, everyone's money and savings are devalued, so in a way government is able to borrow almost indefinitely without restrictions, and force everyone to pay for it. Very addictive, and leads to things like corporate subsidies and unnecessary wars.

That's the problem, bitcoins aren't being allowed to play under the same tax regulations. Dollars are treated as money and aren't taxed in transactions, while bitcoins are forced to have an extra tax on top of the sales tax you already pay for the goods. Nothing about this competition is fair. That's what the OP's post was about: bitcoin is not being allowed to play under the same tax regulations, making them unviable.
We actually have the same problem in USA, where EVERY bitcoin transaction must be reported as a taxable event with capital gains paid on it (which you don't have to do for any other currency), but the only reason bitcoin is still competing is probably because everyone is just ignoring those tax requirements.

Savings they give out as loans. Checkings they often sweep out overnight to some central bank interest bearing accounts, and then get that money back in the morning, plus interest. Now that interest is negligible, so they can only earn money on loans, but those have extremely low interest rates now too. Just enough to cover overhead and risk from default. So they're left with making most of their money in crazy (stupid investments), checking accounts from large banks now charge ridiculous fees (BofA just switched their free checking to $12 a month checking, and Chase, CapitalOne, Wells Fargo, and Citibank don't have free checking any more either), and bank branches are continuing to close down, especially in economically depressed areas, because banks don't make any money on checking accounts there.

I don't mean fluctuate. Inflation in USD is by design, and with continued government borrowing is assured to continue, or even accelerate. It's only being propped up because other countries are willing to buy our debt. As soon as they stop or slow down, inflation will be the only way for US to continue paying for things.


If I get paid in BTC, the place I shop from accepts BTC, and their vendor accepts BTC, there is no reason for fiat in at least that micro economy. As more businesses accept it, there won't be a reason to convert to fiat. And with BitPay adding 1,000 merchants a week, that's where we're going.

3) Use private key in formula to make bitcoin address
Repeat 1 through 3 for every address, back up every private key.
**BIP32 method of generating addresses:**
1) Generate random number
2) Use random number + *n* in formula to make private key (*n* is 1, then 2, then 3, and so on)
3) Use private key in formula to generate bitcoin address
Repeat steps 2 and 3 to make more addresses, incrementing *n* by one every time. Only need to back up the initial random number, called the "seed"

Government already has its own cryptocurrency. Dollars are about 97% digital, with transactions between banks being encrypted. The difference between bitcoin and government is in who controls the ledger. Governments control the whole ledger all by themselves, in bitcoin the ledger is controlled by everyone and no one. So, even if government switched to a blockchain based currency, they would have to mine the whole thing themselves, and there won't be a difference between the new one and what they have now.

It wasn't until just 1 year ago that people even started hearing about it. Before the China bubble, less than 10% even heard about it, let alone knew what it was. And since it was heard if, it has been anything but stagnant. We've had big corp after big corp accepting it, and more and more financial gurus and economists starting to promote it on TV. Upgrades have been steady on the same once or twice a year schedule as before, and tons of new innovations were created in the mean time (side chains, tree chains, inverted bloom filters, micro transaction channels).
So, really, the history of bitcoin is 5 years of stagnation, followed by just one year of boom, adoption, and expansion. The decline in price, likely from greatly increased use by the hodlers, is about the only downside, and the only thing you can point to as a possible failure.
As for its flaws and limitations, those have been discussed, debated, **and solved** years ago. The solutions just haven't been implemented yet because it works fine as is, and they are not a priority.

Actually, no, my hypothesis is that voluntarily supporting social programs is charity, not socialism. Socialism based social programs require everyone being forced to contribute, and an authority determining how those contributions be distributed.


When you pay for anything, you should be receiving services (or goods) in return. What's special about that? Only difference is that we don't pay taxes, taxes are confiscated from us. No one pays (donates?) taxes voluntarily.


Your hypothesis is that without tax supported social programs, base services won't be supported. Who provides your base service of telephone and internet? Or gasoline distribution you need to use your car? If base services are wanted and needed, people will pay for them directly.


That depends entirely on why it disappeared, and what the general opinion of society is towards government. In Somalia government fell apart due to clan infighting, where multiple groups wanted power. Now there is no competent government, but the majority of the population still thinks they NEED government, and are ready to get behind any charismatic person willing to take the job. In Iraq the situation is similar, with people thinking they need government, and multiple tribal factions and religious sects vying for that position. If people didn't want to be governed, and there was no way to impose control over people for the purpose of extorting money from them, it would be difficult for power to come into the vacuum. Imagine everyone used bitcoin, and the local armed tribe had no means to know whom you are paying, or how much money you have. The worst they could do is force everyone to live like peasants, while in reality everyone has a lot of money and deals on the black market, and make people move away without being able to stop any of the capital flight. Add things like 3D printing, including for guns, and decentralized anonymous assassination contracts, and those warlords won't know if the guys they are planning to extort are armed to the teeth, or if they may end up with a huge crowdfunded bounty on their heads if they piss off too many people.


Collective and social ownership of the basic infrastructure and services IS NOT necessary to have a cooperative and peaceful society. But collective and social ownership of basic infrastructure and services HAS proven again and again throughout history to lead to corrupt and violent society. From Soviet Union, to Cuba, to the situation in Venezuela, Ecuador, Greece, and even Russia now. I would say respect for other people's property, rights, and treating people with dignity is in the best interest of everyone, not using threats to take from some who are less needy, and giving that to those who are more needy, after taking a huge cut to the privileged in your own group.


This pretty much happened with farming, and we used to have about 98% of our population be employed in farming. Note that 98% of our population is not unemployed. We will find something else to do.


There won't be such a problem, because no one will MAKE products that can't be bought. Capitalism will continue to work, because the only products that will be produced are those that people can still afford. Even if that means that an item that used to employ 20 people to produce was sold for $200, and now takes one person to produce, and gets sold for $5. Prices will go down, as will investments in expensive automation equipment, especially if you could pay a laborer less than what it costs to take out a loan to buy a robot. Everything will find a balance just as it always had. The only two problems that will really happen is that minimum wage laws will keep making it cheaper to buy expensive robots instead of hire cheaper workers, and same laws will keep businesses hiring lower income people for simpler projects, leading to continued increases in unemployed people (actual unemployment, not people who are actively looking for work and can't find it). Low skilled laborers will also be a huge problem, since no one will be able to hire them, and after so many years they won't have the skills and possibly drive to look for work or be creative in earning money.


I guess it'll be chaos, since, as I said, basic income relies on that money coming from somewhere, and it won't be inflation or taxation. Maybe property taxes, but that has it's own issues. Especially since poor people still have to live on a property and pay taxes, so they'll essentially be funding their own basic income through higher rent.


Marx didn't point anything out rightly. He had no formal economic education whatsoever, was a leech on his family, living off of loans and being a miserable person to be around. He contributed nothing to the economy, did a lot of arm-chair economics, and wrote a big whine about how the world is being unfair to him, which became his manifesto. Everything he predicted ended up being false, including the idea that all roads lead to socialism. Governments that tax and use those taxes to give out handouts lead to socialism, and then eventual collapse (Soviet Union and such). It's pretty much inevitable when the minority produces a great deal, the majority has a great deal of political power, and there exists a system where that majority can keep voting to take more and more for themselves.
But, again, this is all irrelevant, since bitcoin will make the means of paying for socialism extremely more difficult if not impossible. Charity, sure.

Stuck as in needing quite a long time to get confirmed. I've talked to a few pools on behalf of Mycelium, asking hem about their transaction fee policy, and whether they were planning on lowering it.

A limit, or confirmation, on any large transactions, regardless of which account it is in? 30 BTC was quite a lot to just move out.

Not as safe as completely offline wallets or dedicated hardware wallets, but much safer than keeping it in a hot wallet.

From our techs: These patterns can affect SRAM state.  So can temperature, for instance.  The effect is that we may get slightly less entropy per bit of SRAM — for example, 1/25th instead of 1/21st.  But we still have a lot of margin. And of course, we regulate and filter power supply inside ME.
We are considering adding a salt option to the configuration file, which you can generate yourself using dice, which will then be combined with the entropy on the device. Thoughts?

Um, duh?! That's what I said I'm doing! And by lost I mean you are carrying your bitcoins on you, and you drop or lose the thing you're carrying them on. If you were carrying your cash, you're screwed. Sure, you can put your cash into someone else's hands, and spend probably 20% of your economy to keep it safe... Imagine if all that percent of your economy could be used on something other than just keeping your cash safe.


Lol!!! Are you saying they do? Then why do we have FDIC and so many financial regulations to keep them in check? You would trust your bank even if you knew it doesn't have massive regulatory pressure keeping it in check?


To send money, you pay to make sure your bank has your money, to make sure it doesn't spend or invest it poorly, to make sure that it's secure enough to not get robbed or hacked, to make sure it will reimburse you if it loses it, to make sure there is a system that your bank and the recipient bank can transfer money, to make sure that this system is secure and is not hacked (which apparently it is), to make sure the recipient is a "good" person, and to audit to make sure the money left one account and got into the other account properly. You pay for all that in part by taxes, in part by bank fees and charges on loans and other bank services, and in part by allowing your bank to rent out your money at high interest rates, and give you 0% or a bit more than that in return. It's like, "I'll give you my apartment for a year, you can rent it out to whoever you want for $1,000 a month, and then you can give me $20 every month for free!" So, although you don't see it directly, yes, it costs a massive fortune to do something as simple as send some of your money elsewhere.


Right now you can't spend Bitcoin for rent and emergencies (though in some place you can), but you can already spend Bitcoin on about 99% of things you may need without needing to cash it out. And you can actually cash it out that same day, within a few hours, though it won't be cheap.


Because I'm not a redneck, and stupid ideas like that don't cross my mind (can't a curious dog follow the weird smell and dig it out at night? Or anyone else who sees you digging?)


Lol! That's not bitcoin collapsing. Wtf?! :D Yes, if you put your money with an unregulated and uninsured third party, there is a risk it will disappear. It doesn't actually matter if the money is bitcoin or dollars. Bad investments collapse. Thanks Captain Obvious.
The point is that **I have no choice but to use a third party service** if I want to make my cash digital, and thus they better be insured and regulated. I have tons of choices if I'm using bitcoin, from just doing the security myself, to using an insured and regulated bitcoin-storing third party, to using cryptographically secure systems, like multi signature accounts, that don't even need insurance or regulation.


And yet I have been using it for everyday commerce since June, so... (And it will only get better)


Because as you so aptly noticed, I was comparing Bitcoin to cash, which is what it's closer to, not a bank. Normal people who have small businesses typically get paid in cash and have to carry that cash. Even if it's from their place of business to the bank. I'm not even going to go into the fact that a whole lot of normal people can't even get a bank account.


I'm curious, what kind of houses are you buying where the downpayment is $250,000 O.o


How are people carrying Gox on their phone or paper? What the fuck are you even talking about? Are you one of those people who thinks MtGox is the Bitcoin CEO or the company behind bitcoin?

Did you forget to make a backup? Oh, wait, you can't back up dollars ;)
@_date: 2014-09-22 02:07:59
Let's start from beginning: supply and demand. To keep things simple, let's keep demand fixed. As supply of something goes up, its price goes down. There's more of it, so it's easier to get, and sellers are more eager to get rid of it, since if they don't, their competitor will. But price is just something being relative to something else, like one loaf of bread relative to a dollar bill. If supply of bread goes up relative to number of dollars, you will be able to get more bread for those dollars. If supply of dollars goes up relative to loaves of bread, you will need more dollars to get a loaf of bread. Inflation is increase in the number of dollars relative to everything else in the economy (prices go up, dollar value goes down), and deflation is the decrease in the number of dollars. Now that that's out of the way:
Why would people not spend? You said it is because their bitcoins will buy them more tomorrow than today. 
Why would it be worth more tomorrow? Because the economy tomorrow will have expanded more relative to the total amount of bitcoins. Deflation, where there are fewer and fewer bitcoins relative to the economy (or more and more economy per bitcoin) means each bitcoin is worth more, or conversely each unit of "economy" is worth less. There are more economic units going around due to economic expansion.
So, less spending due to deflation means less to sell in the economy, and less to make. Economic expansion stops or starts to shrink due to lack of spending, due to deflation.
Now bitcoins are expanding faster than the economy. There are more bitcoins going around then economic units, meaning bitcoins are cheaper and it will take more bitcoins to buy an economic unit. People will have to start spending bitcoins, because a bitcoin today will buy more than a bitcoin tomorrow. We have inflation instead of deflation. People are buying, companies are making, economy starts to expand again.
If economic expansion becomes faster than bitcoin expansion, process repeats where things get cheaper and cheaper, and people hold off on purchases. If economic expansion slows down and becomes slower than bitcoin expansion, things get more expensive and people try to buy as soon as they can.
This is overly simplified, of course, as there are many things people will always need to buy (food, water, energy, shelter, healthcare), and really want to buy (electronics, vacations, entertainment, insurance, transportation), and mainly the luxury items will be affected by this back-and-forth most. Plus there's the "feeling richer" factor that has been demonstrated over and over with bitcoin, where when your money is worth more and more, you feel like it's OK to spend more of it, since you are "feeling richer," as opposed to when the value of your money keeps decreasing (as with inflation), you start to worry if you will have enough to afford that important purchase later, and decrease your spending just in case. Bitcoin demonstrated this by BitPay, Coinbase, and bitcoin merchants in general reporting much higher sales when bitcoin price is going up, versus when bitcoin prices are falling. But I hope this explains it somewhat.

Correct, the keys are stored on the device. The device is a fully self-contained wallet. It will have a custom radio that can reach 300 meters. Sending coins from device to device would be done through this radio, so as long as you are near each other, you can send each other coins (and text messages). Unless you are in a vicinity of someone connected to a node that is connected to the internet, transactions will be done offline and stored on your device, as well as broadcast to everyone else in the area. As soon as someone brings their device within range of an internet-connected node, all stored offline transactions will be immediately broadcast.

Fall of oil prices causing government failure means that the government owns oil industry communist-style. If the government wasn't being overly socialist with their spending, and actual communist with their industry ownership, then the failure of a single industry would have only affected that industry and related economy, not the whole government or its currency. That government was never really all that capitalist, and things are WAY worse now than that can a few decades ago.

Yes. Just make sure that the 16 character password is associated with the PDF, however you store it (each time you create a PDF, it encrypts it with a different random password, so unless you wrote that down at the same time you saved your PDF, it will be useless to you). 


CDs could be even less durable than USB. Cheap ones have a plastic layer at the bottom, and data layer right on the top, which you can scratch off with a fingernail even. High quality CDs have the data layer sandwiched between two layers of plastic, so scratching the top won't harm the data. Take a key or some other piece of metal and scratch the top of your CD. If you scrape of flakes of foil, that type of CD won't last more than maybe 2 or 3 years ([Here is a picture of what such data damage might look like on a DVD without the sandwiched data layer]( There's also [M-Disk]( CDs, which are costly and require a compatible CD burner (though they're as cheap as regular ones and often come standard now), and that one basically etches your data onto a layer of stone, so those last for ever (but I think a single disk costs something like $15).
EDIT: Hah! Checked the prices and they have dropped substantially! It's now $3 per dist ($30 for a 10-pack). I might have to get some myself to archive some keys :D
In any case, I think the best option is not to pick the most reliable storage media, but to simply make multiple backups, regardless of the medium. Make three CDs, even if they're crappy ones, store them in different places where they won't rub against things or melt in high heat, and you should be ok, as long as you check up on them and replace them regularly, when you see them start to deteriorate. But, of course, ink and paper are still the best (or at least cheapest of the best).

Except it was not. The old MGT trading platform that was converted to Bitcoin was scrapped way back in 2011 after the $30 crash, which was also caused by MtGox. There was a security hole in the original platform, so MtGox team decided to scrap the whole thing and write everything from stratch. The only thing that's left in MtGox that has anything to do with Magic the Gathering is the name. That's it. Even the employees, managers, and owners are all different.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:04:24
Because it had exactly 0 to do with Magic the Gathering? The website and trading engine were written for trading MtG cards, but was changed to trade Bitcoin almost right away. Then, way back in April 2011, it was sold by the hobbyist who created it to the more professional (slightly more) currency exchange guys that have ran it since, and then all the internal code was completely rewritten from scratch in June/July of 2011 (after the old code caused the crash from $30). But since the brand name MtGox was recognizeable, they kept it. So, different owners and management, different trading engine, different everything. Literally, the ONLY thing that MtGox has to do with MtG is the name.

BitPay charges merchants 1% per transaction. BIPS, I think, charges customer a higher bitcoin exchange fee and in effect charges customers the fee for transactions. Generally, though, BitPay has more advanced merchant services, while BIPS has slightly better international integration. So if someone is in US, I suggest BitPay, if they are in Europe or elsewhere, it's often dependent on who can cover their local currency best.

Go to your Keys tab (swipe to the list on the left). You should have a list of addresses, with one having the green text "Local Trader Account Key" under it. If you don't see a list of addresses, go to Settings in the drop down menu and enable Expert Mode. When you find the Local Trader address, highlight it, and in the drop down menu select Export. This will show the QR code of the private key. Use the new phone to import it by clicking the key icon with a + next to it in the upper right corner (if you don't see the icon, enable Expert mode). Once you import the private key, open Local Trader, navigate to the “My Info” tab on the far right, select “Create,” and select the address that your Local Trader identity was tied to before.

There's no benefit to this over Blockchain.info. Blockchain downloads the wallet app into your browser, where the private key is generated and encrypted with your password, before the excrypted data package is sent back to blockchain for storage. So blockchain.info never sees any of your keys, and never gets your password. If they are hacked, the hackers won't get anything other than encrypted files. If they are hacked, and hackers change the code to have your locally entered password sent to them, they can compromise your wallet just as easily as on BitGo. So BitGo just makes it a bit more complex, for no extra security.

Of course not, and no one disputes that. Is it a coincidence what when someone gets a new $20,000 credit limit credit card, and uses it to buy a new car and go on vacation, that they experience a great period of prosperity? No. But the debt and bills eventually come due, and either they spend a long time of no prosperity and hard work, or they go bankrupt and lose everything. Like governments that go bankrupt and lose all those nice social programs and pensions they bought with borrowed money.


No one is arguing that people shouldn't use 100% of their money for anything but spending. Fractional reserve banking is a lie, calling "investment" banking. You aren't putting your money in a safe bank when you are putting it into a "bank" account, you are giving it to someone else to invest. And on top of that we have government provided insurance and bailouts that remove any risk from these investors, letting them invest of whatever crazy risky investment schemes they want. What would be better is if people who put their money in a bank actually had it in a 100% reserve bank, and people who wanted to invest put it into investment banks and crowd-lending businesses, where they knew their money might be exposed to risk, and could act appropriately.


You don't need someone creating more fake liquidity in the market than the market determines is actually needed. It distorts people's risk assessment and makes them more risky at times when they wouldn't be. That leads to wasteful spending on products and projects that in the end no one actually wants, leading to surpluses of housing, services, junk, and garbage. Not very healthy. What's worse is that this 2% inflation means that every year someone gets to make 2% of the entire wealth of the market, without actually contributing any productive work to that economy, and being able to spend that money without oversight, however they want. At the expense of everyone else losing 2% of their own wealth. Plus, over the last 1 or 2 decades, as this system is coming to a head, inflation has actually been closer to 7%, not 2%. But of course it's in the government's best interest to play those numbers down (just as Argentina recently had, before it collapsed).

Not sure what you mean here. In our wallet, you have a Scan QR button (looks like a camera). It's the same button you use for everything. If you scan a bitcoin address, it will take you to the payment menu. If you scan a BitID QR, it will just log you in. The UI is the same, as is the signing code.


Not really. Both require the exact same functionality (sign message with private key and broadcast) and the same security (keep that same private key secure and not exposed to anything). Both benefit from the same backup, and the same HD wallet functionality (different addresses get used for different websites to keep your public keys from being tracked across sites). Both benefit from technological improvements in security (implementing APIs such as those being developed by Rivetz would make your private keys as secure on your android as they are on a Trezor, making your login information as secure as if it was on a Trezor).


I would explain it as being able to log in using your login and password, or by providing your bitcoin account. Kinda like you log in with Facebook or Google accounts now.


For the former, they probably won't even know that their QR scan button works with BitID too, so they won't be affected. For the later?... Either they will have to use a wallet, or someone will write an app that doesn't store money, and just uses HD wallets for BitID logins?

Amazon: run a business from OpenBazaar on a hidden node, selling books, electronics, etc. Use public warehouses to store goods. Possibly in another country. Sell directly through the platform, ship using standard methods. All the government sees is trucks with goods coming across the border.
Car dealership: that's more difficult, since you have to register the car with the state to get it insured, but a dealership could sell directly, like a person to person sale, after advertising online, and keeping their cars on a car mover. You will be responsible for paying sales tax, but the dealer will just take the money, give you the title, and move on. Granted it won't be able to advertise with card on a dealer lot, but it will save money on property rent, property taxes, and business taxes.
Frankly, I don't know. I'm just guessing. But I'm sire someone will figure it out.

How many people spend their money on Gyft or BitPay accepting places, and don't declare a capital gains event? There's no way to tell, but I would guess a lot.
There's also the case of the portable millionaire: Unlike previous currencies and financial systems, which were stuck in a bank and had to be moved around through transfers, it is now possible for wealthy people to literally carry all their wealth with them, without anyone being able to stop them from moving it, or even knowing they have it. Such a person can be just some average guy no one knows much about, renting some nice place somewhere, and paying for rent and everything else in bitcoin. There is no way to tell how much he is spending, what he does for work, or how much money he has coming in. And if the situation where he lives becomes unpleasant, he can just pick up and move elsewhere, whether that's across town, or even to another country, living there without citizenship or work visa, but still working online for some company somewhere. These kind of bitcoin millionaires actually exist already, and I am sure than many more will emerge. Some may not even be millionaires, but just mobile workers and entrepreneurs who find it easier and cheaper to live without being restricted to a specific political border. And I suspect in the future, some governments, especially small island nations, will actually compete on laws to try to attract such mobile millionaires to their own country, knowing that they can't force them to stay, and the only way to get them to come and spend money in their economy is to have laws that are easier on the wallet than their near competitors. Actually, some islands are competing this way already, too.

Not everyone has to have a full server node. Typically those would be run by exchanges, mining pools, "banks," and large businesses that want to process their own transactions quickly and securely. But yes, it would be less efficient that just an interaction between the merchant's credit card POS and their bank, HOWEVER, don't forget that just in that interaction you need a lot of accounting, regulation, fraud insurance, and other stuff just to make it work. Bitcoin takes care of all that just with the redundant nodes.
Regarding hashing, no, servers don't need to hash. They just verify and process transactions. The only things hashing are miners, who don't even need to have a server themselves, and get the work they need to hash from the pool that runs the node (so you could have hundreds of miners, and just one pool with a server node).
With regards to nodes, keep in mind that wallets that don't run their own nodes (SPV) typically verify transactions they receive themselves, and verify balances and transactions by crosschecking multiple nodes. So even if the number of nodes was very low, not only would all those nodes have to collude (unlikely if they are competing for miners), but any false transactions they try to send are likely to be rejected by those wallets too.
And finally, most people won't have to be their own bank. With multi-signature addresses, it is fairly easy to set up wallets that require a "bank" to countersign every one of your transactions, and run an algorithm that will monitor for any suspicious activity. So if you get robbed, the thief will not get much. Such banks can also offer insurance (you'll pay a checking account fee like you do at many banks now), and similar insurance can also cover the merchants you shop with (it's called "assurance," where the company assures you against causing harm to others, as opposed to other things harming you). You would shop from merchants that have assurance coverage, and if they steal from you, the assurance will cover your loss. Don't shop from merchants with bad assurance, or who are being forced to pay high premiums, because that tells you they are not trustworthy (those who are will have very minimal fees).
Hope that helps.

That's not the same thing. You are using existing communication methods to broadcast TCP/IP packets. Just like bitcoin can use existing communication methods to broadcast signed transactions. But you can't send the internet over, say, UHF TV transmission, because they are two completely different protocols. Just like, say, Bitcoin and Litecoin.


Bitcoin was announced by Satoshi to the intended public, and once launched and shown to work, it was designed and developed as a product to be used by tech oriented users, who would be able to make it easier to use by the rest of the public, just like Linux was. It's the same thing.


Just like bitcoin


Just as Satoshi no doubt made several experiments, to see whether nodes would talk to each other, whether transactions could be verified correctly, etc. Once Darpa got a working version of the internet going, did they scrap all their networks and build a new one from scratch? I doubt it. Plus all those pieces that make up bitcoin weren't invented by Satoshi himself. It includes routing, distributed network, cryptography, and other technologies that were invented and being experimented with by many other people. Satoshi simply put them together in a way that worked. Also, he published the paper in November of 2008, after he no doubt spent a lot of time testing and experimenting with systems to make sure they work together, and from November 1st until he actually launched Bitcoin on January 9th, for two months, he was discussing the merits of the system with other programmers, no doubt using their ideas to tweak his own.


And I stand by my statement that this view is something you made up to make yourself feel better. Regardless of what you think, bitcoin is being used for production, and is nothing at all like at the experiment stage.


In a way so is bitcoin (a use of the internet).

A decentralized exchange doesn't need audits, since all trades will be peer to peer, directly between the traders. There is no central exchange holding someone's bitcoins and dollars. So in this case the only centralized point of trust will be the Realcoin issuing party. That trust will depend on whom Brock has signed up to administer this, and what banks have signed up to support it (i.e. remains to be seen).
Regarding question of getting realcoin, apparently there are talks with banks and ATMs to support this thing, meaning you would use use your bank or ATM to get them. The exchange would be handled by your bank, not by them.

Yes, VISA can piggy back their system on top of bitcoind, by exchanging USD to BTC, transferring BTC, and exchanging BTC back to USD. It will still be slower, more cumbersome, and more expensive than just send and receive bitcoin directly. (not to mention redundant, since VISA already has a USD transfer network built out)

I'm not sure what you mean by "publicly" in that. If you mean "in a way visible and verifiable with SEC and IRS," I guess, maybe, though I think you can provide that service just by letting people register their bitcoin addressees, and let them trade their own coins in their own wallets. I'm trying to think of what kind if "secret sauce" you could possibly add to bitcoin that it doesn't already have, and honestly, the only things I can think of are
* Government reporting
* Transaction tracking. This may be a big one, since it's a pain to track when you bought specific lots and at what price, when you sold those lots, and what the capital gains are on each one. And,
* Security services
The first two may not be marketable to many early adopters, since, as they say, bitcoin is the ultimate offshore account, and many of the people who got in early are libertarians who have no love for government. The last one may be useful, though, since once your wealth gets to a certain level, you start worrying about personal security, and people using wrenches to try to extract your password.
Your big killer apps will be in derivatives, though. There is still no good way to hedge bitcoin with options and such. This might, again, not really market too well with early adopters who are used to the wild ride and believe bitcoin still has a lot of up to go through, but it is definitely something "new" bitcoin money is looking for (like Overstock.com)

I haven't actually seen a transaction get "rejected." Worst I've ever ran across is a transaction taking 2.5 days to confirm. Second worst was a transaction that took over 24 hours, the output of which was (inadvertently) used to by a gift card from Gyft. The card purchase was not approved due to the unconfirmed low-priority input (BitPay didn't let it go through, so the merchant didn't even have to deal with it). Once the transaction confirmed about a day later, an email to BitPay pushed the purchase through literally within a few minutes, and the gift card was in my wallet.
Hopefully, with Merchant Protocol being more widely implemented, transactions that are too low priority (such as no fee) will simply get instantly rejected by the merchant, so you can try again right away, or will have the merchant add the fee to help speed it up.

Sure, but bitcoin exchange fees are between 0.25% and 1%, not 2.5% to 3%. If bitcoin goes mainstream as currency, there will be no need to pay exchange fees, since there will be no need to exchange it into anything else.


If they get your credit card number, your name, your address, and the 3 digit number on the back of your card (all things that get stolen from credit card databases), what procedure have they failed to follow?


If tat were the case, we wouldn't be talking about chargebacks. Funds are approved and available, but can still be pulled back within 6 months for any reason whatsoever. For something like a car dealership, having $20k pulled out of your account without warning would be devastating. So I'm not sure how many dealerships, or merchants that sell very expensive items, bother dealing with credit cards. (note how most of them want you to use their own financing options)


Security is already better than credit cards. You can't steal money from just knowing someone's bitcoin address, while you can from just knowing their credit card number and name. If you receive payment to a cold storage wallet, your security is 100%. Once we have hardware wallets, security will be even better.


You can't manipulate a contract programmed into the bitcoin protocol. IT is 100% guaranteed. So, if you program a contract that will hold money in trust, and transfer it to someone within a few years, or if you program a contract that will work like kickstarter, collecting money until it reaches a certain amount by a certain date, and if it doesn't, refund all the money to all the donors, it is 100% guaranteed to carry out, and no one can manipulate it or do anything about it (it's as guaranteed as a bitcoin transaction). On the other hand, lawyers with money in trust, and companies running kickstarter campaigns, **can** be manipulated, and give that money to someone else, or put a hold on the money and keep it for themselves.

Yes. Our servers would have to scan all transactions all transactions for everyone, as opposed to just answer balance requests for specific addresses.

It's just another wallet, with different features. You would need this if you like the features.
LocalTrader is like LocalBitcoin, where you can meet to trade with people, but the coins are traded directly person to person without a third party in the middle, and all transactions and communication is used using your bitcoin addresses, including encrypted P2P chat.

My arguments are about what bitcoin is actually doing, and how it was actually developed.if anyone is displaying wishful thinking, it's you. A lot of people who claimed that bitcoin is worthless and useless, and will crash to zero soon, end up coming up with more and more excuses to try to keep convincing themselves when bitcoin stubbornly refuses to go away.
(1) Sure, you can't, but you can also include claims by Coinbase, Gyft, plenty of other companies, reports about events like Bitcoin Black Friday, growing transaction vokume on the blockchain, and actual experience from meeting new people at bitcoin meetups and conferences. The number of users is growing. There's no getting around that.
(2) I didn't see any "these guys" in that article. One investor I guess? Looking at the trading activity on various exchanges, there's no evidence that just one or a small handful of accounts has been manipulating the price. The guys in China are also by far not the only really really big investors out there. So if those guys in China lose interest and sell everything, there are at least half a dozen people in US and Europe who will snatch them up. Actually, the idea that it's just a handful number of people manipulating the currency is somewhat of a joke among the wealthy bitcoin elite, who dismiss it as just another stupid conspiracy theory (yes, I hang out with those guys). And they keep buying more bitcoin when they can.
As for how there can be another 1000% bubble, its because there wasn't an opening of the "Mainland Chinese market." There was an opening of a few exchanges in China, and a few Chinese people starting to trade, while the vast majority of Chinese didn't even know what bitcoin is, and still don't. Another bubble can happen for a variety of reasons, such as the ETF finally opening to the public, allowing mutual and hedge funds that hold a combined trillions in assets to finally buy into bitcoin. For many of those funds, adding just 1% of their portfolio as bitcoin means over $1 billion dollars worth. Then there could be a general adoption by any country who's currency is collapsing, that implements harsh currency controls that restrict buying and holding dollars at the bank. And then there's just the natural adoption of the technology due to its greatly improves safety, speed, aad convenience compared to established financial systems, which could eventually create a speculative attack on the currency of the country it is adopted in.
Really, the ONLY way you could believe that bitcoin will not bubble again, is if you think that bitcoin technology is inferior and more limited than the established financial systems. And if you think that, then you don't really understand the underlying technology of it.

That's what the guy who sold all his bitcoins when it hit $275 this past summer said. He expected to buy them back at $200, when $275 was actually the bottom. I don't know if he's still waiting. Point is, it's impossible to predict the bottom. If you are trying to sell while they are up and buy at the bottom, you are day trading. Practically gambling. If you believe in bitcoin's long term promise, you should just buy at whatever price they are, and hold. If you REALLY believe that bitcoin will succeed, you shouldn't be holding any cash at all, and just use bitcoin as your main currency, including for buying all your stuff, only selling cash when you can't buy something for bitcoin directly.

If someone gives themselves money, I ignore them because on my list of accounts they only have some set amount, and if they create a new account I ignore them because they're not on my list at all. It's how bitcoin makes counterfeiting impossible (as I explain it). As for money creation, that's mining, and I generally don't go into it unless they actually ask about it, and then try to simplify it as just people doing special accounting work to verify and sign off on transactions themselves, and when they pass THOSE messages around, everyone agrees that, if their job is up to spec, they should be paid and allowed to add a new account number to the bottom of the list with 25 new bitcoins in it. And that's the only way new bitcoins can ever be created. Again, no math, and trying to simplify it as much as I can.

When you spend for a bitcoin address, the entire balance has to be spent. Single wallet addresses create a transaction that spends all the money, with part f it going to the merchant, and the remainder going back to the same address. It's easy to look on the blockchain and track that address's entire spending history, and if you find out whom that address belongs to (such as if the user pays you), you can see all of their transaction history.
HD addresses create a new address for every change transaction, so money leaves an address, part of it goes to the merchant's address, and change goes to a completely new address. Someone looking at the transaction on the blockchain has no way of knowing what money went to the merchant, and what went back to the user, so has no way of tracking transaction history. And if you receive a payment, all you know is the address you were paid from, but have no way of knowing if the previous address was the user's, or was someone paying the user. The more a user uses such a wallet, the more itterations of this that their spending goes through, and the more mixed up among addresses their transaction history gets.


Wait, what? That's exactly what CoinJoin does. It's the equivalent of a bunch of people wanting to pay a bunch of different merchants, all the people dumping their cash into a box, shaking the box around to mix the cash up, and then all the merchants taking out what they are owed. There's no way of knowing who's cash went to whom, or even if some of the cash went to a merchant, as opposed to back to some user who wanted to mix their coins a bit.


As I said, there will probably never be a way to evade property taxes, but for cars there's always services like Uber.


That issue doesn't apply to employee/employer relationship. Employees file their own taxes, and employers do their own. If I am a company that is operating online and is skimping on taxes, and my employee pays theirs, or buys a car and gets busted for not paying his, they get hit with tax evasion charges, not me. So for those employees who don't want to take risks, they can still get paid in that same money. They just have to declare income taxes.
Please keep in mind that I'm not just talking about US employees working for US companies. Bitcoin is a global phenomenon. There are a lot of countries where issues with taxation are already a problem. And there are a lot of companies that are not even in US that hire US employees remotely. Some company in Brazil could be hiring an employee in Germany as a contractor, paying him bitcoins, not declaring their income, and that employee may decide to not declare his income either. If they don't spend large amounts (i.e. rent, use public transportation), then they are unlikely to be noticed. And if one of them is busted, it's unlikely the other one will, since either country doesn't really care about the other country's tax problems. But these minor cases of unnoticed evasion, when combined en masse, can add up to huge and completely unexpected woes to a government that may suddenly end up not having enough money to pay others to go after these people. Just like a few people downloading music weren't a big issue, but when combined, caused a lot of damage to the recording industry, before they realized what was happening, and were able to react to stop it (not like they could stop it, anyway).




As I said, one does not impact the other. And the IRS isn't going to audit you because you were suddenly able to afford a $50 purchase online. Also, regarding ordering things online, don't forget OpenBazaar on the horizon.


Cash is easy to track. The businesses are physical, transactions are physical, and businesses have a physical presence. Just like stealing music used to be an entirely physical affair, where you had to steal an actual CD from an actual store. It's much easier to hide online.


One, or a dozen, companies subpoenaed is not the issue. What you propose would require almost all companies being subpoenaed, constantly, having to constantly report every sale, including customer name, address, and purchase amount, to the IRS, just so that the IRS can build a spending history on every single person, and then compare it to that person's reported income. Although MAYBE that is possible, I doubt it would happen. Plus it would make all companies that are able to be subpoenaed lose all their business to those that are online, overseas, or otherwise can't be, due to the enormous added tracking and filing cost.


Which are both highly portable, and usable anywhere in the world. Unlike a bank, which keeps your money in a specific jurisdiction. Which is my point.


Bitcoin is still very new with very little adoption. If you want to compare impacts of this, look at how many millionaires who aren't using bitcoin yet are using offshore tax shelters, and living in countries that don't require tax reporting (quick Google search says estimates are $20 trillion?). Then imagine that becoming much easier to do, as those people move their money into bitcoin.




It's being developed by a fairly well established entity that has major concerns about spying and privacy. They know. And such a thing is easily tested for, anyway. Just monitor communications coming out of that separate piece of hardware, and see if there is anything coming out that isn't being requested by the wallet app.

Which is why I led to me next question...




The answer is yes, they haven't grown all that much. They are a tad higher than what they were at over a decade ago, but adjusted for inflation, the return is really paltry. At the same time, levels of inflation spurred debt growth and savings shrinkage continued. I.e. inflation is making the vast economic recovery mostly a mirage.




Why waste my time when you can Google?




Were as in past tense. They are buying less of it, and are putting their money elsewhere. Much of it in gold, which suggests they are nervous about the global economy and the dollar as well.




OK, well, what happens is, since interest rates are very literally the price of risk, the riskier something is, the higher the interest rates that are demanded by the market. So if US debt gets to levels where it's not trusted any more, US would have to raise interests rates on that debt to make the risk be worth it to borrowers. However, if the tax revenue is only enough to cover the interest payments already, raising interest rates would make them too costly for tax revenues to cover. In short, the math will no longer add up, and the options will be to raise interest rates but vastly decrease the level of spending instantly, or keep interest levels the same, but sell much less debt, and again vastly reduce the level of spending instantly. I'm saying instantly because no one will vote to cut government spending without risking their political career, so this will all be dragged out to the last minute. And, of course, the first things to go will not be corporate subsidies or military, but safety net programs, parks and environmental protections, and other lower to middle class things. Such a sudden cut to the economy will not give it time to adjust, and will quickly ripple through a whole lot of other private businesses, likely causing a recession that will make 2008 seem great.




I don't even know where you got the idea that this has anything to do with 6% of the world...
But, to give you an idea, the Great Recession of 2008 had an economic contraction of just 4.7%. Now imagine if the US can't borrow at current interest rates, has to raise interest, and can only borrow 94% of what it could before (with interest rates at 6%). That would lead to a contraction just within government of 6%, and ripple through the rest of the economy for a possible total of 10%. Twice as bad at 2008 with one major key difference: we won't be able to borrow (Quantitative Easing) to stimulate the economy. The **only** government option will be to ride it out all the way to the bottom. 
Please, feel free to point out where I'm wrong and why I'm just scaremongering.


Then why are you wasting everyone's time by staying alive?

The transaction that is related to a trade is the one that is initiated by the Local Trader system itself. That's when it will add the fee as well (LT transactions are done seller to buyer, so you don't even need to exchange bitcoin addresses). Yes, you are free to meet with the buyer, cancel the transaction, and send the money any other way of you wish to save 0.2%. Were perfectly OK with you doing that. It just won't add anything to your trader reputation score/history.
You can use the same address for both trading and normal stuff. It's only when your address is used through the LT system that anything different happens.

Online banking still only operates during working hours. When banks are closed, all you get is "your transfer will be processed the next day." At least for banks in US.

Well, if everyone knew about such transactions, where both parties say where their money will go, and both have to sign off on the transaction for it to execute, then these types of scams will become pretty much completely useless, since even if someone is gullible enough to go along with this, they won't sign the transaction unless they see the scammer sending his share of coins to their address.
Mostly the point is that bringing up this idea pretty much gets rid of any objections the scamer has. Either they agree at that point, or they don't have the money and leave.

Q1 or Q2 of 2015
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:55:30
* Internal bank transfers are free and immediate here in the US too, but with the huge territory and probably over 50+ different banks in the country, including small ones and Credit Unions, which typically have better fees, it's somewhat rare that you, your friends, your family, or whoever you need to send money to, have the same bank.
* External bank transfers in US are 2 to 3 business days, and longer to foreign countries like Canada and Mexico, because banking systems are not compatible with foreign countries.
* You guys have national IDs that are that trusted? Here you must show up in person and sign tons of things, because we are terrified of terrorists or something... By the way, for that reason, US citizens are no longer able to open bank accounts in any European banks. Your banks don't want to touch Americans with a 10 meter pole.
* Depends on why you need to withdraw it for. If you want to give it to a friend, no need to withdraw if you can just send it from your phone to theirs. You can also buy almost anything in the US with bitcoin now, and it will be 3% cheaper than with USD.
* I was starting from a premise of you have cash. That happens a lot when you run a small business or a farm. Yes, you can go deposit that cash in a bank and do a bank transfer. I mentioned that.
* This isn't the 1600's. Embargoes don't really work, and it could be for services that are entirely digital, too. Some countries ban porn and gambling. Some ban supporting political resistance or things like Wikileaks. Not all governments around the world are as nice and not full-on-retard as the one you live in. Some citizens have to deal with crazy religious people being in charge.

Don't know if this will be of interest to you, but here's the brief overview of what's being planed and discussed (dev name redacted):
rassah: btw, just want to make sure, is BitID going to be HD compatible, with different sites getting diferent addresses?
xxxxxxx: we just discussed how we want to do it, and yes, we will probably have some kind of "identity accounts", and each account will equal one identity, and derive the key used to sign into a site from its account key plus website host.
xxxxxxx: so if you just have one account, you will already use different addreses for each site, and if you make a second account, you can use that to log into the sites as somebody else
rassah: So different bitcoin addresses for different sites? How will the client remember wich address is for what?
xxxxxxx: it will have one key for the identity, then append the site host, and hash. so the same site will always result in the same key being used.
rassah: So the same bitcoin address for all sites? The site will store the bitcoin address as the public key of the person loging in. At least that was the original idea. Has that changed to it just being an arbitrary key hashed from a bitcoin address and the site's host or domain?
xxxxxxx: the hashing is internal in our app. so we are using a different address for each site, thats all the sites know. but internally, we will derive this key from one single key tied to the account, plus the sites name. so we dont need to store different keys or remember which key is for which site.

It's relative numbers. For 1BTC = $10k, either BTC has go up in value, or USD has to go down in value. In the long run, all that has to happen is for BTC to outlast USD. Since BTC is digital with strict rules that can not be changed, and has a lot of benefits that people prefer over USD, including some that don't have anything to do with money (using the blockchain to sign legal contracts, property registration, etc.) people will likely continue to use it for as long as we will keep using the internet. On the other hand, USD is going down in value constantly, and empires never last.
So you saying that BTC will never be $10k either suggests that BTC will lose useful value (highly, doubtful since nothing else even comes close to what it provides), or that USA and the USD will outlast bitcoin (also doubtful, since USD is inflationary and USA loves spending).

It's not really **escrow** escrow with multisig. Escrow required a third party to hold the money. Now for the first time the third party can do the job of an escrow, without direct control of the money.




Multisig with a large amount of people holding keys. The party could issue tokens backed by the bitcoins in such a pool. You could then trade those tokens on an exchange, as if they were bitcoins themselves, knowing the exchange can't run with your money, the pool storing the coins backing those tokens can't run with your money, and that a hacker would have to compromise a majority of the pools to steal money. It makes a MtGox scenario almost impossible. ( You could also use such a pool to establish collateral for tokens backing something else, knowing that a majority of competing owners would have to sign off to release that money, and no single person can run off with that collateral.


Out of curiosity, what are the fees, do you know? Merchant paid credit card fees for gambling and porn sites are typically 10%. I guess you could deposit using PayPal and still have 100% of your funds available, as long as the house has at least a 10%+ edge..?




Of course, that's why expensive things like FDIC and deposit insurance don't exist, right? :)
Proof of reserves was invented specifically after MtGox and possible issues with fractional reserve at other exchanges. The alternative proposed solution was what banks normally do: follow strict accounting practices, report accounts on a periodic basis, follow regulations, get reviewed and audited once or twice a year, and pay for deposit insurance in case the portion of the money they invested elsewhere gets lost somewhere. Tons of money, tons of people, and tons of trust. Or, we could just math, since it's easier, and doesn't require us to trust both banks and regulators (who have proven themselves untrustworthy many times already).


In select countries, with stringent restrictions, and with you needing to trust their company (the third party) to hold and not confiscate your money. There are a few stories around about how someone wanted to start a charity fundraiser through Kickstarter, and Kickstarter accused them of not being a registered charity, and confiscated their money. For our company, we wanted to raise money for a USB device that generates a random number and uses it to create a paper wallet that it presents in a form of a jpeg for your printer to print, and, get this, we were denied because "Kickstarter rules forbid raising money for financial services." A hardware random number generator was banned from raising money because some moron didn't know what the difference  between an RNG hardware product, and a financial service, was. Yeah, no thanks. Oh, plus also the whole need to spend lots of money (about 7% in fees) and have a lot of people work on it, when the alternative is built in and free.


You and I create a contact that I will sell you X widgets to be shipped by some date, and you will pay me Y for it. We create a contract transaction that you deposit Y into, and the transaction itself is programmed using bitcoin's own transaction script to confirm and be included in a block if your inventory of widgets goes up by X by some date, or fails and becomes invalid, returning the money if it doesn't. No need for lawyers, trusted parties, or any dispute resolutions. Contracts can now get programmed in code, and money automatically moved based on met criteria, instead of having them written, held, and carried out by lawyers.


You know what else is a horrific store of value? The US dollar. Back when it was starting out. And practically every other newly introduced currency. And every small cap or startup stock. Basically anything that is just starting fluctuate, and stabilizes as it gets bigger. It's not a function of bitcoin, it's a function of asset growth and adoption. Otherwise it's an excellent store of value: it doesn't rust or spoil, it doesn't get devalued by sudden unpredictable expansion in supply, it doesn't rely on any company, government, or entity, and it can be copied and backed up as many times as you want, on any medium that can store information, virtually guaranteeing that it will survive any type of calamity.

Bitcoin is the very first competitor that exists in a digital form without having to rely on a trusted third party to hold the money for you, and is thus the first form of money that you can send over long distance completely by yourself. It's also the first form of money that is not restricted by whoever owns it, since it's not owned by anyone, and allows anyone to build anything they want on top of it.


Not really. Just install an app, and pay a 0.5% to 1% currency conversion fee. No need to fill out bank forms to open an account, since bitcoin accounts are just software. As for the reward, discounts on shopping, more control of their money, more privacy, no restrictions on what they do with the money, and global access to shopping, where they are no longer restricted to zones that only take their currency. A lot of the benefit is from the merchant's side too, since it costs them 3% to 5% less to accept bitcoin payments than credit card payments, and they don't have to retain customer records for two years, as well as follow costly procedures and audits to keep that customer data safe for so long. If you are in US and go to a bar, ask them where they keep their credit card info. If they'll tell you, you'll likely find out that your local bar is a huge fire hazard, with tons of paper just sitting somewhere nearby.


It's the same with bitcoin. Bitcoin, compared to the established financial/banking system, is faster, free and accessible from ubiquitous computers, doesn't need you to create bank accounts with all the papers and security verifications it entails, no need to wait for your bank to get to and process the transaction you requested, and no possibility of errors. It's also much easier to use than the current banking system.
For example,  buying music using old banking system vs BTC:
* Banking system - Create user name and password. Add credit card information, including your full name, address, and phone number. When buying music, log in using your user name and password (hope they don't get picked up by malware in the process), pick music you want, select buy, maybe go to the checkout, verify payment details, confirm, start downloading (I may be a not outdated on the process. If yes, sorry).
* Bitcoin system - Open page with music. When you do, a unique key is generated for your session, from which unique bitcoin addresses are generated for every song. All this happens instantly in the background without your knowledge. Browse music, with easy song having a unique QR code next to it. When you want to download one, just scan a QR code with your BTC wallet and hit send, and the song immediately starts to download. No logins, no personal info, nothing. Just pick, pay, done. This is already available BTW.
The benefit, in its entirety, is this: Banking money transmission systems are owned by banks. You can't use them without permission. You can't innovate on them other than at the edges. So over the last 50+ years, our big inventions have been credit cards, and things like square. Bitcoin is a completely open platform that anyone can innovate on at any level. In just the last two years we've had more innovation with bitcoin uses than on the last 20 with the banking system, with things like Reddit tip bots, probably fair gambling, that music thing I mentioned, contracts and notary services, etc. So your question about why this is better than the other thing is kind of like asking why the internet in 1993 (an open and free to build anything on top of platform) is better than the Bell long distance phone network (a closed and proprietary system). After all, it was much quicker, easier, and cheaper to just call someone long distance back then than to send them an email. Bitcoin is a 1,000x improvement, just like internet is a 1,000x improvement over a long distance phone call, but the innovations are just starting to roll out.
I hope that helps.
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:25:53
Uh... somewhat complicated. That's the software part that we're still working on to simplify. I believe generally you will have one card start listening for contacts, the other will broadcast the contact info to add it to the first card's list, then the first card user can select the contact to pay to, enter the amount, and broadcast the transaction, which all the cards that are listening in the vicinity will hear, and all of them will store. Whenever one of them gets to an internet connected spot, they will broadcast the transaction to the blockchain.

Wait for the country the westerner is from to start having currency troubles (Cyprus, Greece, Spain, maybe US eventually). They'll care then. Plus the average user may end up preferring point-scan-send to fill out forms with name, address, numbers, and dates. Have you seen some of the new bitcoin powered music services? No need to create accounts with logins, passwords, personal and financial data; each music track has its own bitcoin address QR code, and as soon as you scan and pay to one, it initiates the download. People may find that much easier and more secure than the old type of payment systems.

From what I understand, Realcoin is specifically supposed to cover that last mile, by being itself integrated into the legacy financial system. So instead of bitcoin exchanges handling usd to btc conversions, you can have banks do the usd to Realcoin conversions, and then be able to swap those Realcoins for btc anywhere you want. Backing realcoin with us dollars is only to give banks the confidence to be able to swap in and out of it themselves.

Right now it costs 1% to process a Bitcoin transaction, since you, as a merchant, have to convert it to USD. Same for Litecoin and all other coins. Should Bitcoin become more mainstream, where merchants can pay their employees and suppliers in Bitcoin, it will cost 0% to process a Bitcoin transaction, but still 1% to convert altcoins to BTC or USD. I expect most altcoins to die about then.

Less than 1/4th the cost due to you providing your own printer, and likely even cheaper if it becomes mass produced.
~~Higher level entropy, since we use true entropy off of dedicated hardware, instead of computed entropy off a CPU.~~ As was pointed out below, I was wrong about this.
~~Use any kind of ink and paper you want, so cheaper to print lots of wallets, and thermal paper is not reliable in high thermal situations (ever leave a receipt in a car on a sunny day? Comes out black/brown sometimes).~~ Was wrong on last one, as Piper let's you hook up your own printer
For the most part it's just cost and source of randomness. Otherwise I'd say they are about even.

In Mycelium hit *Receive*, then at the bottom hit *Copy to Clipboard*.
Simpler addresses are just not possible, because the addresses are a hash of a hash of a random number. If we were to make them smaller, they would lose a lot of security, since the whole security is based on not being able to guess a really large random number. Eventually you may be able to link an easy to remember name to an address, such as through Namecoin, but that may make the security not as good, since someone else could spoof your name and send the coins intended for you elsewhere. So, the addresses will have to stay as long and convoluted as they are now, but we may make something less secure but more convenient in the future.

I don't think "proprietary creative stuff" is anything more than a concept created by the state. It can be either a capitalist, or a communist state, but "proprietary creative stuff" is definitely NOT created or enforced by capitalism.


I apparently know A LOT more about it than you do. But since you claim otherwise, feel free to explain how so called "intellectual property" would be enforced in a government where no one wants to pay for it. Maybe you yourself should read some books on the history of copyright, too. For instance, did you know that in the time of the Renaissance, considered one of the biggest arts and creative booms in human history, there was no such thing as copyright? There was no communism, either, just capitalism. Yet artists still made a living...
Just admit it, you just want to earn money from doing nothing, like a typical communist oligarch.

Doesn't the hacker just need to hack the client browser to get the password, and then can use that password to log into and spend from the server too?
For blockchain.info: Hack browset (install keylogger), steal password, use password to log into blockchain, steal coins.
For BitGo: Hack browser (install keylogger), steal password, use password to log into BitGo, steal coins.
I'm not sure how BitGo makes things safer, unless it uses some other method besides the hacked browser to check whether it should be signing anything with its own key.

You can use a service to pay for the free 90 day warranty, protections, insurances, etc. The difference will be that you will actually have a choice of whether to pay for that service. I've never used it or needed it, but I'm still being forced to pay for it. It will be kind of like "free" credit cards vs annual fee credit cards that provide concierge services now. Statements can be just a part of your Bitcoin wallet software. And instead of 1% cash back, you could just get 2% to 3% instant discount, though some services like Gyft already give you that kind of cash back discount.
So, I'm not sure why you say you can't provide the same level of customer experience. No one is providing it now, but they can in the future if people ask for it.

They nationalized their biggest industries, set up massive social safety nets and subsidies, and then when their economy plummeted due to companies avoiding them for fear of nationalization and socialist restrictions, they had to increase those safety nets and social programs to keep more and more people out of poverty. But since their economy was crashing, they had no source of money to pay for those social programs, and were forced to print it and borrow from abroad. Which brings us to today, where the end result is exactly the same as that of every other country that ever decided to go full socialist, from tiny Cuba to massive USSR: they're collapsing into hyperinflation. Socialism, bordering on outright communism, was exactly what caused their demise.

How much in taxes did Silk Road pay? Or any of the people selling on it, whether the products were legal or not? Once it becomes possible to use OpenBazaar anonymously, and people and businesses start selling products and services through that, how many of them do you think will be reporting taxes for the money they earn? Since IRS declared that bitcoin has to be treated as property, and taxes paid on every transaction, how many Gyft users do you think are tracking each purchase and plan to report it? Even cars are easy to buy with cash, especially if the blockchain starts being used for title ownership tracking. 
Yes, not EVERYONE will start avoiding taxes, but because it will be so much easier to just forget and ignore them with little consequences, people's general perception and opinion of taxes will change. Just as it did for copyright.

I explain bitcoin as everyone having a piece of paper with a list of all accounts and their balances, and sending bitcoins simply involves passing around messages to move money from one account to another, with a signature proof that the message is from the originating account. The only math involved is addition and subtraction to increase one account and decrease another, and all trust comes from simply checking every such message against your own copy of the list, to make sure that the account has enough money, and isn't a made up account.

Hierarchical Deterministic wallet. Normally every time you create a bitcoin address, you do it by taking a new random number, sending it through hashing functions to get a private key, and then another set of functions to get the bitcoin address. So the only way to back them up is to back ALL your private keys up. HD wallets use a single random number, called a "seed," and then generate the first private key from random number + 1, the second from random number + 2, etc, to make as many private keys and bitcoin addresses as you want (it's not actually as simple as just +1, +2, but it's similar). So, as long as you have a backup of that initial private seed, you can always restore all the bitcoin addresses you make.
The main benefit of this is to get rid of address reuse. Right now, when you send coins from your bitcoin address in most wallets, the change goes back to your own address (e.g. you have 5BTC, you send someone 3BTC, the transaction actually send out the whole 5BTC with the recepient getting 3 and you getting 2 back). With an HD wallet that can keep creating new bitcoin addresses, when you send someone coins, the change will be sent to a newly created address. So when someone looks at this transaction on the public blockchain, they will see coins leaving your wallet, but won't know which coins went to the person you're paying, and which went to you, since both will go to a new address. This greatly improves privacy (which can be further improved if we implement CoinJoin). You can also use HD to create separate receiving addresses for different people, or even different wallets, each with their own subset of addresses. And all of these can be restored with just the single seed that you initially backed up.

Lots of poor people have a Dunning Kruger thing, where they think they know better, and reject any knowledge or support offered them, even if it's given by those who have actually used that knowledge successfully. I had a lot of experience with that when I worked as a personal financial analyst: people with nice houses and plenty of wealth were happy to have me come over, evaluate their financial situation, and take my suggestions into consideration, even if often I had little improvements to offer. People with crappy houses who were in dire financial situations would most of the time listen to me explain how I could restructure their finances to save them hundreds a months, and have them retire debt free within 20 years, then tell me that there must be some catch (despite me explaining everything), or that my suggestions don't sound right, and telling me they are not interested and can take care of things on their own. I know at least one of them filled for bankruptcy two years later, and another was forced to go with one of those debd consolidators that leaves a worse mark on your record than even bankruptcy.

We are discussing the best way to implement that now. This would have to be updated by one of the developers to be effective, since a compromised developer could just be asked not to let our communications guy know anything about warrants, and that unsuspecting guy would just keep updating the canary as if everything is ok.
Ideally, though, we want to not even have to have a canary, and keep it so that even if a warrant is served on us, no one will be able to get anything other than encrypted gibberish. We already encrypt all user communications using their own private keys (we just store encrypted text for retrieval), and once we implement Tor for updating wallet balances and sending transactions, hopefully that will make us a completely useless target for warrants.

* Using this with Android where it loads it for a moment is not as safe as fully offline or separated system like Trezor, but it's still less risky than just keeping it on your phone. If the phone is not rooted, it's a bit more difficult for malware to sit on the phone and look for keys in a protected region of memory. There are zero day exploits of course... Also, Entropy just generates keys. If you want to be extra safe, you can import them into an offline system for signing. Eventually you will also be able to generate HD Seeds, and maybe even import them into Trezor and Bitsafe. The purpose is to make things a bit safer and a lot easier, not to make things completely 100% safe.
* Printers with ethernet or wifi do not send what they are printing off USB over the network. Instead, files are printed directly from the device, sometimes without even loading it into printer memory (data is accessed and printed right off the USB device in real time), and often without even letting the PC know that anything is going on. I don't know whether printed documents and images are stored in the HDD, other than maybe just metadata, but there doesn't seem to be any way to see it or retrieve it on the HP and Canon printers, at least. Even large office printers don't usually store anything other than metadata (though they have the option to store entire documents, and thus we recommend against using them). So if you want to be safe, disconnect the printer from the network, print, and then reboot it. That said, we are still investigating which will be best and which you should be cautious about.
* Regarding the source of entropy, the study published by Daniel E. Holcomb, Wayne P. Burleson, and Kevin Fu, linked to from the Indiegogo page, shows that using this method enables "true random number generation" with 9011 bits of entropy in our devices. We have made our own analysis of the entropy of the chip we have chosen, it passes NIST tests and and agrees with the results of the paper. This entropy source may be even stronger than the combination of the few sources available on the PC.

That would still require some work. The stretch goals are mainly to see if there is enough demand for us to spend the time to do it ourselves.
By the way, we plan to have a txt config file in there already. If you plug the device into your PC while holding down the button, it shows us as just a regular USB drive with all the software and config files there. Flashing is as easy as copy/paste, and you'll be able to edit config files for things like changing the M and N in M-of-N wallets, maybe adding files for extra entropy, etc.

Mycelium Wallet for Android already supports BIP38. You can find it in the Cold Storage menu selection (just scan a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet).
Bitcoincard will not need it, since there won't be much of a reason to import or export BIP38 wallets. BIP38 also requires a massive amount of memory, which it doesn't have (and would make it cost a lot).
If you mean Mycelium Entropy, same deal, there's too little memory to support BIP38. However, since you will be able to edit settings files on the device, maybe someone will add a simpler encryption method, where you would enter your password in a text file in the Entropy device, and then all the paper wallets it generates will be encrypted using that password (maybe that someone will even be us)

I just googled this claim, and the search results say otherwise. Where did you learn that it is illegal for fellons to start companies? Even if still on probation?


Don't long-cons promise a non-existent product, and typically end in some sort of con, instead of actually shipping a product? I get that BFL looked very much like a long con, but at this point they shipped products, and claim they have caught up with their order backlog. So I'm not sure how they qualify as a long con. What is their con exactly?


Yes, you said that. I need to know what the fraud, or deception, was. What did they lie about? Did they know it would take them a year to deliver products, and have knowingly lied by saying it would take a month? Please explain the fraud. I am honestly concerned, and you claim to know and understand this very well.


No mining hardware will make you back the bitcoins you spend on getting it, simply because the difficulty is still rising to fast. That's not a BFL only problem, and I am almost always advisint against buying mining hardware, suggesting instead to simply buy bitcoin. Did you come across advertisements or claims from BFL that state otherwise?


Ok, finally something that's actually concrete. Where did you learn about this, and can you point me to a link, or at least give me some search terms to find evidence that's not just hearsay? I actually wanted to order a mini rig myself, and would be quite upset if I did get screwed because I didn't kno that I could just skip the wait line.


Any evidence for that? Avalon was shipping tons of miners out before BFL even had theirs built, so it would be hard to see whether or not BFL actually did that by looking at the mining difficulty increase itself. How was it found out that BFL did this?


I am sorry, I am not trying to be pedantic. You said they comitted theft, fraud, and are a long-con. I am simply asking for some evidence (any evidence) or details of your claims, as I can't simply take your word for it, and neither will the legal system. You brought up very serious allegations. I simply want some sort of proof. I am not in any way involved with BFL, but I need to know the facts, before I can decide whether I should be associated with them in any way (business or personal), or avoid any dealings with them in the future.
On the other hand, if you are just making things up, because you don't like the company and **feel** like they are committing crimes, then I'm sorry, but you are wasting my time, and may be doing something highly illegal yourself.

If you have your 12 word seed, you can just wipe the wallet and reinstall. The PIN reset is for those who never made a backup or lost it and forgot their PIN, or sent coins to the wallet before making a backup and made a typo when entering their PIN, or had someone else set a PIN to screw with them. We did actually have cases where people didn't have a backup and ended up with a PIN they couldn't unlock, and ended up having to dig through their phone's database to get their coins back again.

Regulation is still a solution that is at the very most a patch on the problem, not a fix. And a costly one at that. Bitcoin has solutions to eliminate the problems altogether, such as by getting rid of reliance on a third party to secure and transfer your money, not needing an auditing service (which itself may be untrustworthy) to make sure your bank/financial service has all the money, not needing to rely on strict regulations and policies to keep your financial data safe at some other company (e.g. Target), etc. etc. etc.

Should that happen, I would expect that the Transaction Confidence progress bar will only go up high enough to cover the sybil nodes, and get stuck way before reaching a high percent. Maybe this could also be mitigated by keeping a list of the top mining pool IP addresses on file, and give a warning if one of the mining pools reports hearing a conflicting transaction?

The scary threat of computer hackers, cyberpunks, and child pornographers turned people off from the internet when it first came out. There was nothing in the internets besides chat, and it was pretty much useless for anything. Yet eventually people adopted it.

@_date: 2014-11-01 03:55:43
Somewhat. If you use Mycelium Wallet's cold storage feature, it only loads it temporarily into protected memory, which, on an Android where each app is sandboxed from all others, is really difficult for any malicious apps to get to. Then as soon as you create a transaction and press send, that key is wiped from memory again. It's not as secure as a dedicated hardware wallet like a Trezor, but it's close. It's mainly designed to be used as a savings account (or I guess a paper savings "certificate ") that you keep safe and mostly just send money to. I am sure soon it will be possible to load the private key QR code and create transactions completely offline, too.

Yes, Crypto will change from the way it exists today, but it could be Bitcoin itself that changes.

That's true, if used that way.

The main gist of the article is that an IOU is inherently worth less than an actual thing an IOU may represent, and as more people start to realize that (such as by seeing that they have way more control over their money when it is in their bitcoin wallet than in their bank), they will value holding actual things more than holding IOUs. What part of that do you disagree with???
As for the idea that it might replace the dollar, question: how long has the English language existed? Bitcoin is a protocol. A language, basically. As long as you can believe that a language can outlast a country or a currency (which the English language obviously has), it's easy to imagine bitcoin simply outlasting the dollar, even if that bitcoin has changed slightly by then.

One difference is that I can transfer bitcoins to you by meeting face to face, and literally saying outloud the database transaction characters that need to be entered.

The CPU in these things would take hours to compute a BIP38 encryption, since it's very inefficient and requires massive amount of memory (which is its whole point). It's just not feasible for this.


That would add a considerable amount to the cost. It should be possible to boot the device into flash mode on your PC, add a text file like password.txt with your own password, and implement some more basic encryption that's not as resource intensive as BIP38, but that functionality won't be available right away.


Right now the processor just creates a fake file system, and a jpeg image. For what you purpose, it would need to have enough storage space to store a Linux boot system, and enough CPU and memory to boot Linux and load a whole bunch of generic printer drivers. Basically a full computer that would probably cost at least three times as much to produce.
We are trying to make these things dirt cheap and easy to use for non-techie people. Part of how it will be secure is that by using cheapest parts available, it will be very hard for a manufacturer to compromise it, since backdoored components would cost considerably more to make and include than the very basic parts we use. The fewer parts and the simpler the construction, the fewer possible attack vectors we expose.

Cyprus's $100k limit was not a deposit insurance thing, it was a cut across the board. I think originally they were even debating making that number lower, but got too much protest. One of the now big Bitcoin advocates was all over the forums and Reddit a year ago, complaining how they took $700,000 of his $800,000 from his business account, which was money the business needed to function and pay salaries, so he ended up not being able to pay anyone, fire everyone, and shut down his business. I only know about him because he was into Bitcoin and posted about it on Bitcoin related forums. I am very sure he's not the only one.
I also suspect he won't be the last one, as Cyprus's strategy is being discussed as a possible future plan of fixing issues in other European countries.

From the Indiegogo site:
The hardware based entropy is collected by using a chip with static RAM as the source of entropy, as described in the scientific paper: [Power-up SRAM State as an Identifying Fingerprint and Source of True Random Numbers]( (Holcomb, D.E.; Burleson, W.P.; Fu, K.).
We wouldn't be making or selling it if all it was was just a simple standard RNG. This thing generates 9000+ bits of entropy, from which we use 256 bits. All the parts are off-the-shelf generics that we put into a custom design ourselves. No NSA here. All the parts are the cheapest and most basic components on the market. If the manufacturer was compromised and had installed some sort of backdoor, that would require them to use much more sophisticated and expensive devices, meaning they would have to sell us each device at a loss. Once we get these devices delivered, we will open a few at random and verify that all the hardware components are the right ones. And finally, we will very likely add a "salt" option, where you will be able to save a text file to the card that includes your own random data, such as coin tosses or diceware, which will be combined with the entropy generated by the device to generate the key. That way neither your computer, not the Entropy hardware, will be compromiseable by themselves.

@_date: 2014-12-27 18:57:35


Mining doesn't influence the price, since reward output remains the same. The price influences mining. Difficulty dropped because the price dropped, making mining unprofitable for some.


BitPay alone receives and sells off an average of 1.5k to 2k coins a day. And most of the institutional coins have been actuioned off and sold already.
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:59:16


If they have 51% of the mining power, that means they are creating blocks faster than everyone else. That means their blockchain fork is outpacing everyone else's, and remains as the only valid one. So, even if the 49% still creates blocks, the 51% can just ignore everyone else's blocks, knowing their next one will still be faster and farther ahead.


Since their blocks will be fasters, and their blockchain form accepted as the main one (due to being further ahead than everyone else's), they can choose whether or not to include transactions in the blocks. That's the extent of their manipulation, though: being able to decide what transactions get included going forward.


After all the coins are mined, miners will still get paid with transaction fees. Hopefully (and wit market forces, probably) the sum of all transaction fees in a world where bitcoin is fully adopted will be high enough to cover mining costs. For example, in the last 24 hours, transaction fees have averaged about 0.101440715 BTC per block. This amount should go up with increased use.

No, servicing the same USD/EUR clientele in the rest of the world, through an exchange and company outside of whatever caused them to fail in US, since it's still cheaper to accept bitcoin through BitPay than a credit card through anything else.
If your original implication was that BitPay will fail because bitcoin itself becomes illegal, well, there are still 156 other countries to do business in, and BitPay is not a US exclusive company.

When you mix, the server doing the mixing has to keep track of which coins belong to whom and how much each person contributed, before mixing the coins and giving them back.

As jesset77 said, bitcoin addresses that have not been spent from are not affected by quantum computers. This is because QCs can reverse a single hash, but not a double hash. A bitcoin address is actually a hash of a private key, which makes a public address, which is hashed again to make a bitcoin address. So those late to the party who haven't upgraded and bothered spending will still have their bitcoins secured until they do.
As for active users, that infrastructure **would** be upgraded instantly. When quantum computers actually become a threat in some near future (remember, tech isn't developed instantly), bitcoin apps will include a piece of code that will support new quantum-resistant algorithm, but which will be completely dormant until a set date some months (or years) in the future. As soon as that date is reached, the code will activate, creating a hard fork, and all of bitcoin will switch to the new system. This way everyone will have plenty of time to update. Also, the update is just software, not a hardware infrastructure, so it won't be that big of a deal. This is actually how make bitcoin upgrades work, and have been done in the past, with up to 16 months of warning where everyone could add new code to their apps.

You can't have too short confirmation times (like Quark and such), because of the limit on speed at which blocks can propagate across the network. Bitcoin's 10 minute block time was designed to support global amount of transactions. Something with short transaction times (like 30 seconds) will work fine with very few transactions and tiny blocks, but will explode and collapse in forks if it ever gets used for any sizable amount of volume. The network would never be able to reach a consensus.

That's pretty sad that we assume that because someone is older, they are dumber and won't get technology. My mom is almost 60, and is a senior software developer at her company, despite only learning to program maybe 15 years ago.
Instead of assuming "**but** for her age," we should hold older folks to the same standard as everyone else, and expect them to be just as smart. Besides, there are tons of younger people who know nothing about tech. It's not age that's the problem.

Bitcoin the currency is absolutely nothing without bitcoin the transactional technology and bitcoin the decentralized ledger. Ironically, a lot of accountants dismiss bitcoin, because all they see is either money, or the ledger. It's like Buffet dismissing domain names as just silly names without any worth that anyone can create, and claiming that the whole internet is worthless, because everyone understands names. Or claiming that the internet would work great, if it just wasn't for domain names (or IP addresses).
I'm an accountant too btw (well, financial analyst, which is close). If you don't understand the transaction technology and the ledger, and all you comment on is the currency, then of course you should be dismissed, despite your much revered input on things you do actually understand.

There's a difference between having the right to get in touch with some random person and tell them whatever you want, and getting in touch with someone with actual power, and lying to them to try to influence that power against others. For example, should I have the right to get in touch with your local police station and mention that you have a huge stash of kiddie porn on your computer? I'm sure you could see how that lie would cause way more problems than just blabbing about random stuff to someone without the power to kick down your door and confiscate your crap.

I've bought over a grand worth through them and never had a problem. I had the same suspicions and asked them about it, plus did some research on the side. Apparently Amazon gift cards are not just given as gifts, but as payment in some situations (maybe as a bonus, or to pay under the table or something) and on the open market, on gift card exchange sites, an Amazon gift card sells for about 60% to 75% of its value. Swapping your card for bitcoin at 10% discount (which is what's generally done, as opposed to the often claimed 25%) is not a bad deal.

Most secure option, second to using Armory in Offline mode, is to use Mycelium on a **non-rooted** phone with a BIP38 encrypted wallet from bitaddress.org or bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Mycelium has a Cold Storage option that lets you scan the private key into protected memory, spend some of the coins, send the change back to the paper, and wipe the key from memory as soon as it's done. So the private key exists only in protected memory for a short time.
Soon we will be releasing Mycelium Entropy, which is a small USB device that plugs into your printer and generates a completely private and secure paper wallet as a JPG file, which your printer sees as a photo that you can print directly to paper. That way the paper wallet is never exposed to the Internet or your computer. We plan to have that ready in about 60 days.

How does USD-based "Bank account" become "Internal BTC Addy?" Are they going to run the exchange themselves? And how is "Internal BTC addy" become USD in the prepaid VISA card? Another exchange? I just don't see the purpose of this, versus just going directly from bank account to prepaid visa.
In the long run, sure, banks can have BTC accounts and store BTC just like they store USD, but if that's the case, then why not just have BTC in your own BTC account &gt; BTC in someone else's wallet (or even BTC in a prepaid card)

The only two decisions were "Buy bitcoins through MtGox" and "Not buy bitcoins."  I think the first decision, to get bitcoins by any means, was the better one. As for Bitstamp, that only got bigger and more useful than Gox just last spring.
Yes, with bitcoin, putting your trust into someone else is a terrible idea, but some people weren't comfortable with their own security. Remember how many come were lost to people getting hacked or forgetting their passwords? Does that mean keeping bitcoins on your own computer is a terrible idea too?


Yes, that is correct. The price went down because more people converted their bitcoins into dollars, meaning there are fewer people holding bitcoins now. That's how markets work.

Oh, then it's exactly like that, except instead of storing the certificate on your computer, you store it in your bitcoin wallet, and just scan a QR code when you want to log in. The idea is that few people use and store certificates (and even PGP keys), and there is little focus on keeping those certificates secure, but everyone eventually will be storing bitcoin addresses, and there is a lot of security improvements coming with that, including hardware improvements. Also, BitID can use HD wallets, so you have a different address (certificate) for each website, making it impossible for sites to associate logins by tracking where certificates were used.

You have no rights to many things, like what you can own, what you can put into your own body, and what you can do, even when that doesn't actually affect anyone else.

You don't have freedom to move around, unless the government allows you to by giving you a passport. Plus no-fly lists?
You are not allowed to live in places not sanctioned by the government. Zoning laws prevent you from living anywhere other than preapproved areas. You can only work on specific things, and if you want to work for yourself, you better be ready to ask for a lot of permissions, and pay a lot of extortion fees (licenses).

In the same sense, right now it's VISA and MasterCard that are accepting dollars, not the merchant. They then convert their visa IOUs into real dollars and deposit that money into the merchant's account. With bitcoin, that also means that there are plenty of people on the other end willing to buy all those BitPay bitcoins so you could even say that it's bitcoin investors that are accepting bitcoins, not merchants.
Either way, the system works, and the merchant are saving a ton of money (or are giving a ton of discounts)

I know Tony and some of the rest of the gang, as well as the group of large bitcoin investors working with them. From what I have been told, they receive an enormous amount of bitcoins every month, and they don't just automatically sell them on the market (unless they really have to), since that would decrease the price and cost them more than the cash they sent out to the merchants. So they hold the bitcoins, and sell them off in large blocks to bitcoin investors directly. Typically, if you want to buy a few $100k worth of bitcoins, BitPay and their contacts would be the best to go through.


BitPay, like a lot of bitcoin exchanging businesses (ATMs are the newest ones involved with this) typically hold large reserves of both bitcoins and dollars, letting users swap between then, and collecting fees in the exchange. So BitPay already has plenty of dollars to pay merchants, and doesn't really need to sell constantly. Especially since selling still takes a few days for the cash to get into their accounts (compared to bitcoin being transferable instantly).


Wow! That is a nice find. Thank you! I'm not exactly sure what their methodology for finding BitPay addresses is, since their addresses are always changing, so I suspect some entries may be missing, but it's still an awesome source of data.


They claim 50% of their merchants, although it's just what they claim 


Looks like there's a large BitStamp dump every day or so, and they prefer to keep about 1,000 bitcoins on reserve, meaning they do hold a lot of coins, and bitcoin users are affecting the price by having their coins ending up being dumped on Bitstamp. But it does look like they are still selling fairly large blocks to unidentified addresses directly. I wish I could download that entire transaction list so I could run some analysis on it in Excel.

@_date: 2014-12-30 15:27:18


Yes... And when you buy bitcoin, you have a claim to the long term cash flow in the form of share appreciation as the bitcoin businesses grow.


Profits like those generated by BitPay, Coinbase, exchanges, and a ton of other companies, all operating under the conglomerate of "Bitcoin Corp." It's no different from investing in any other large conglomerate that owns a lot of small businesses, except the shares aren't traditional stocks.


No new business is as big as a business that had been around for decades (Amex), so that is a stupid, unreasonable, and irrelevant request. Aside from that, BitPay, Coinbase, every large exchange, every large mining pool, crowd lending platforms like BitLendingClub, physical bitcoin makers, mining hardware manufacturers, hardware wallet manufacturer. And most of those started less than two or three years ago.


Bitcoin already trades publicly, and has all the trading and business data that you would find on a stock exchange. But why do you need something to be traded publicly on the stock market for you to invest in it? Would you not have invested in Google, Facebook, or Twitter when they were privately traded (and worth 1/1000th of current price) even if you had the chance? Or is it that you want SEC approval before investing in it?
My point is that speculation is basically looking at something with very little background, and betting on it in hopes that it will be adopted and take off. You have no trading history or fundamentals to examine. It really is a bet and a hope. Bitcoin has a lot of trading history and fundamentals to look at, and can be evaluated and invested in based on its business activity and development plans. Truez you don't have a single organization with financials and plans to look at, and instead have to look at the progress of a few decentralized and independent entities, but it's still something you can examine, make informed decisions on, and invest in without it just being a bet.

Yes, but is it the actual economy that will be decimated, or an economy based entirely on debts and promises? Even those who don't buy everttything with credit cards end up depending on future promises of someone taking care of them when they are too old to work. Maybe if we killed everyone as soon as they reached 65 that system would work without problems, but as it is now, it's basically an economy entirely supported by a continuously increasing debt bubble.
Besides, maybe that barista will actually be the one to hold his job. When people save more  are careful where they spend, they tend to buy better quality products for their money, instead of crap bought for the sake of just buying. Why can't that apply to coffee, too, where crappy coffee will be avoided, and only good quality made by baristas being purchased?

Try shutting down your Mycelium app completely, and starting it again.

Side chains are not required to have the same block times as bitcoins, and may not even need to use the same hashing algorithm. It just peggs bitcoin to the side chain coin 1-to-1. So you could have a sidechain that has 10 second confirmation times. The 10 minute limitation of bitcoin will only affect you when you are ready to take your side chain bitcoin back into bitcoin.

Not necessarily. Large corporations with monopoly power run into two problems, risk aversion, is too big and cumbersome to react. They make a steady "guaranteed" income, and don't want to risk on any new expansions by dumping money risky competitive projects. So they often ignore new disruptive technology until it's too late. They also have very large bureaucratic structures that make it very difficult to change and adjust to new systems and technologies. Kodak is usually the best example provided of this, where they actually invested the first digital camera back in 1975, but Kodak thought it was a useless and too cumbersome idea, and ignored it, instead choosing to focus on chemical film. Then when digital cameras became popular, it took them to long to readjust that by the time they came out with cameras, other smaller companies already dominated the market. Now Kodak is pretty much bankrupt and slowly fading away.
BitPay may end up being in the same situation, where large established monopolies will ignore bitcoin for too long, then when it's already too late, try to scramble to wedge bitcoin into their already set up legacy financial systems, while BitPay started out with bitcoin, and is able to quickly adjust and implement the changes bitcoin gets through the years.

Ownership inequality is not a feature of bitcoin, it is the result of ANY system that is in its infancy. The % of people who had HD TVs when they first came out was less than 1% (maybe still is). The percent of people who owned Google stock when it went IPO was less than 1%. Now lots of people own HD TVs and Google stock (many don't even know they do, with it being a part of their 401k funds). It's the same for bitcoin. The reason few people own it is because it's so new, but once it's more adopted, it will be much more evenly dispersed. Unlike dollars, where you as a bank can just make more of them for yourself by just lending some out, or printing them if you are a central bank, people who own lots of bitcoin can't actually create more of them, and have to spend them, i.e. give them up into the rest of the economy, to get any use out of them. As those few holders keep spending them, their holdings will go down, everyone else's will go up.

ARM version 9 and forward have that support built in. It's just disabled by phone manufacturers and/or not supported by Android by default. Rivetz claims to be working on a software library and drivers to enable it in Android devices. Supposedly ARM version 11 even supports screen and keyboard separation, so there is no chance of software "lying" to you. They even claim that enabling this will make Android phone wallets as secure as using a Trezor.
Honestly, they have made quite a few claims about this at the recent conferences, and it would be great if someone with much more technical knowledge that me can contact them, discuss this, and corroborate their claims (hint-hint-wink-wink)

You apparently have a different definition of cash flow than I do. To me, cash flow, the accounting term, means a business generates actual cash revenues, instead of accounts receivable IUOs, and after paying out the accounts payable costs has actual cash as an asset sitting on their books, which increases the value of the stock because the value encompasses all of that company's assets, as well as future growth potential.
To you, it should like cash flow means that the company generates cash, and then flows it directly to you somehow (like as dividends maybe?). 


 Your insults and Dunning Kruger notwithstanding, amount of stocks is fixed for some types of shares, and can be diluted for other shares, but not without the input of the shareholders. Regardless, point is, you can look at any company, find out its total assets and total outstanding # of shares, divide one by the other, and get a base price. For bitcoin it's more difficult to get the number of assets outstanding aside from the actual USD invested in it, but its easy to get the amount of bitcoin outstanding. For dollars you get neither. 
I wrote up an explanation for the dollar price keeping its value despite trillions more printed, and the dangerous side effect of that,but I'd rather hear your imput on that. Where did all those dollars go, and is there any risk from them being where they are now?


This maybe is where you are confused. Bitcoin is not a currency. It's also a transaction system. Which is why I was comparing it to AmEx.


I was talking about pre-IPO, remember? When google was making profits and cash flows for about ten years before it was available to the public?


No you couldn't if it was pre-IPO. Not without having a $250,000 net worth and having a license or permission that allows you to invest in private equities. You wouldn't even know the price of the shares, since companies are not allowed to disclose them publicly pre-IPO. This is why I said that Bitcoin's 1,000% growth is not unusual, since it happens in a lot of companies (Twitter, Facebook), but the public is kept in the dark about it, with the poor commoners only allowed to see post IPO stocks when most of the investment profits are already taken, and the company is at a low stable pace of growth.


Is bitcoin itself and the financial transfer services it provides a scam? If not, then you already know that it's not a scam, and don't need so!e regulators telling you so.
By the way, what are your thoughts on DACs, where some companies plan to create a service that people will pay for, and the stocks will be automatically issued and controlled by an algorithm, with their price being based on how well that service does, and with everything being completely transparent and open source? Basically exactly the same as a corporation with a stock, but instead of a board of directors and CEOs deciding on the business direction and whether to issue stocks, the business is set to provide a single service, and the stock amount is fixed or depends on something preset? If such a DAC was around for a while, people were using its services, and its digital shares had value and were traded on the market, would you consider than an investment, or would you still think it's a speculation, because it's not on a regulated stock market? I ask because some people believe that this is the future of corporations, at least for some businesses, and may end up squeezing out a lot of companies out of the stock exchange we are used to, or supplanting it completely. And also because, in a way, that's what bitcoin is, except you have to own its shares to use its services.


I meant that the investors would disagree with your seeming assertion that everything on the stock market is an investment, but apparently that's not your assertion, so they would agree with you after all.


Uh, yeah I do. It was covered in Corporate Finance 210 and Securities and Investments 340. And then I had some first hand experience when I had to create and file all those required annual reports as an accountant. The required reporting is mostly just accounting, which for some businesses you can even make up as long as you have the cash to prove the company cash flow, without relying on your actual business doing the earnings. Sure, it's difficult to get a scam through, but it's not impossible. My guess is that the high cost of going through an IPO process is what keeps scams from going through it more than anything. The "company" would have to scam people out of $2MM to $4MM just to break even.
P.S. Maybe you should stop assuming about my ignorance or things you think are obvious about me. I'm not new to this field.


Then don't invest in them, but the service they rely on to be possible.




Really? You claim that a source maintained and written by experts in the field, which conforms to the concepts taught by universities and text books on the subject, also written by experts, is wrong, and you alone are right? Well no wonder we are having trouble arguing. Your definitions of words themselves don't conform to the definitions I, and apparently the general population, ascribe to.


I claim that the different kinds is based on whether that risk assessment is based on something that is known vs a best guess. Such as speculating on whether a well has oil, vs whether the company will continue making profits. You disagree, claiming that the difference is based on cash flows, which at this point I also don't know what you mean by. So, are the different types of risk based on whether the company gives you cash, versus it just grows in value, or what?


Ah, there it is. I guess that's your personal definition of investing vs speculating? FYI, when I asked about Google before it was on the stock market, it was making huge profits for years. So you may need to renting the "if it's not on the stock market..." category.


Why do you keep dismissing Buffet's own words, that he only invest in things he understands, and he doesn't understand IT technology? This is why he doesn't invest in Google and others, Not because they don't have cash flow or profits. And this is why he was lambasted for making comments about Bitcoin. Not because people thought bitcoin was a good investment that he didn't understand, but because he doesn't understand technology and avoids investing in it, but still makes authoritative statements about something he self-admittedly doesn't understand.

All communications in Mycelium's Local Trader are encrypted using the private keys of the traders involved, P2P. There is no way for Mycelium or anyone else to get access to the communications to figure out who is doing trades where. When you meet someone, check around for cop cars or suspicious characters, and if you feel uncomfortable with the person you are trading with, just don't do it. Keep in mind that even college age looking "hipster" kids can be undercover cops or informants, but those are typically used for drug busts, not something this insignificant. And, of course, refuse the deal if anyone mentions anything about doing illegal stuff with the money you swap. Try to keep the trades way under $1,000 as well, since these low amounts won't be worth the cop's time.
Stay safe and good luck!

Reward comes from both block rewards (currently 25BTC) and mining fees (currently less than 1BTC per block). Eventually, as bitcoin use increases, more and more reward will come from mining fees instead of block rewards. Mining fees rewards should become higher than block rewards way before we mine the last bitcoins, and once all bitcoins are mined, will be the sole method by which miners earn money. Just remember that the purpose of miners is to secure the network, not to create money. As long as there is a need to secure the network, miners will get paid.

Well, there's this, "since January, those Chinese traders have been gradually losing interest in bitcoin (which is only a negative-sum gambling game to them), and gradually selling those gazillion coins -- which are promptly brought to the West by arbitragers."
But generally it's just more global adoption by other users. Those coins have to come from somewhere, and I suspect they come from China as much as from other places.


But your claim is that Chinese traders have been loosing interest, yet volume has been going UP. Even in a currency whose value itself has been going down. Meaning that Chinese traders would have to be trading twice as much today as they were a year ago... *FACEPALM* Volume is in bitcoin, meaning twice as much volume now is the same amount of trading as it was a year ago. Godamnit. You know, this just makes the whole "volume rate" and "loosing interest" comparison pretty friggin impossible to figure out, since you have to compare the ratio of everything to the ratio of the falling price of the currency. Fuckit. I give up.
P.S. thanks for the  tool.

But that's not how Satoshi and the developers have been treating it. To them, an experiment is something you try out on testnet, and the implement into bitcoin.


Same way anything that uses radical new ideas gets launched. You create it, and if it works, you use the idea and keep improving on it. Bitcoin's experiment stage was while Satoshi was writing pieces of code to make sure they interface together correctly. Once it works, it works. You wouldn't build a Facebook, try it out to see if it works right, including having a few thousand people use it under load, and then say, "Ok, it works, let's shut this whole thing down and build the whole thing again from scratch to make a non-experimental version." You take the working solution, and you use it.

Oh! I'm sorry! It's the "banks can use bitcoin technology to do their own internal banking stuff" argument, not "banks can use actual bitcoin to piggyback their USD transfers on top of" argument. Sorry I misunderstood that.
I guess in that case, true, but the counterargument is that it won't give them Bitcoin's most important features:
* Decentralized
* Trustless (you still have to trust the bank as a 3rd party for everything)
* Pseudonomous (or anonymous with some extra software)
* Non inflationary
* International
* Open platform anyone can innovate on (without asking for bank permission)
* Not dependent on survival of some corporation or country
Plus for your idea to happen, ALL banks in US will have to adopt this system, otherwise it will be no different than sending money internally within banks, and then having to wait for banks to settle accounts when they move between banks. I don't see that happening unless the Fed adopts this system first, or government mandates it.

Yes. We now have banks stealing money through things like inflation, libor rate fudgery, investment securities that no one understands, and other BS. Otherwise, the only new feature of banks that everyday people actually use that is not security and transfer, is lending. Personally, I like the idea of being able to specify whether I want my money used for possibly risky investments in other peoples' personal loans, or to keep it all safe an available, rather than socializing the losses and forcing everyone to pay for everyone's personal loans when they fail whether they want to invest or not (which is what you do when you indirectly pay for FDIC).
And, FYI, bitcoin can do things like crowd funding and lending too. It can even do advamced things like IPO and brokerage, and mundane things like notary and title services. So, what other functions of a bank do you believe bitcoin doesn't do?

From apeterson:
The main drawback is the exposure of the public key, and loss of privacy. Normally, the ability to create transactions is guarded by two layers. first, you don't know which public key hashes to the address (RIPEMD160), and second, you don't know the private key to create the publkey (ECC). If you wanted to attack bitcoin on a crypto-level you would need to break both algos. But if only ECC would be broken, then users with address reuse would be easier targets, because their public keys are exposed.
So this is more theoretical, imo.
So you cannot say that the keyspace is really reduced. Or maybe there is a formulism that allows for that kind of notion, but i am not aware of this. But of course address reuse is bad for privacy reasons, and that is very practical. therefore we will create HD wallet implementation

The reason it's taking so long is because it still downloads blocks one at a time, sequentially, while verifying everything. The devs are working on being able to download just the block hashes, which should be quick, and then, once you have the hashes that prove the chain is legit, download all the actual block data in parallel, bittorent style. Should speed it up substantially. It was supposed to have been ready a long while ago, but they got help up for whatever reason...

That's not actually possible in an unreglated market. Wages will be whatever they are actually worth, and if some company forced them to be lower, a competing company would steal all its employees by paying them what they are actually worth (more). The great thing about wealth and profit is that it is mostly amoral. You profit from making and selling something people want. If people don't want what you are selling, then you won't profit. And if you profited, that also means that the people got what they wanted, and are better off as well. A lot of socialist-left don't really get this concept, though in our distorted market, sometimes people do make money by forcing people to get what they don't want (such as poor quality overpriced labor).


That's what everyone typically does, and what everyone should do. Return, aka interest, is a very literal price of risk. The riskier something is, the higher the interest, aka the higher the price. This applies regardless of whether that something is a loan or a return on an investment. So why would someone pay a higher price for the same quality of risk, or trade their resources for way more risk than they are worth? We don't pay twice as much for bread and milk just to be moral...


It's actually a combination of "saved up" and "maintained." Ever heard of the lottery curse? People who win millions who have no idea how to manage wealth often end up more broke and in debt than they were before. Likewise for trust babies who were never taught how to manage their money; they lose it all rather quickly and spectacularly. Saving up and maintaining wealth means denying yourself a lot, and putting a lot of work into making that wealth grow. Considering about 65% of those reaching retirement age get there with less than $100k in their retirement accounts, it's definitely not a skill that a lot of people have.
As for worrying about time, the wealthy people I know personally have none. Hell, I'm "retired" and I'm probably going to be up until 4am working tonight :(
And you are absolutely right about the upbringing. Escaping poverty when being born into it is absolutely difficult due to poor parents not having the money and wealth skills to bestow on their kids. Though sometimes it's also not having the work ethic. Note the many immigrants who come to this country poor as dirt (my parents came here in '89 with $300 in their pocket and barely any english), wo end up having the top positions in various companies. Maybe some people just got comfortable in their societal position, and would rather complain about their situation, while semi-comfortably sitting back and just watching TV, rather than doing something about it...
Sorry for the text walls :)

The circuit board, display, and battery are all flexible. This thing went through some very rigorous testing, from being dropped, to carried in a wallet, to sat on, to even being taken to the beach with water, salt, and sand. Not easy to destroy.

Perhaps you can actually write up some counterpoints to my argument? What "numerous benefits of homeownership," and why are you ignoring the numerous downsides? What does the size of the US have to do with economic and social problems created by sprawl-and-crawl? And what's so great about an economy that has a period of boom, followed by ever increasing corruption of politicians making promises they can only keep by borrowing and inflating loans, followed by major economic collapses? (not talking about US here, but it'll probably come here eventually too). 
Or do you mean that this discussion is pointless because there are no good counterpoints to my argument? (P.S. economics is often counterintuitive, so it's understandable if you thought my statements were weird, when everyone else who has no clue what they are talking about has always been assuming the opposite)

True, volume (sadly) doesn't tell us how many coins the exchange is holding, but increasing volume can suggest either increased price movements causing more bot activity to try to cash in on it, or more users running more bots in general. Impossible to guess, so I agree, a pretty useless metric.
EDIT: Wait, I take that back. Bitcoin price, despite being on a slow decline, has been relatively stable, especially compared to what it was earlier this year, thus no incentive for in created not activity. And the increase in volume has been more than the drop in price (if we consider 2x volume is equal to 1x volume if x is price that halved). So the increase in volume could only be explained by more traders from either increased adoption, or users moving over from another exchange.
I mentioned Bitstamp account holdings as in there are a lot of Bitstamp users that are depositing bitcoins into Bitstamp to trade, and those coins are being moved off into other addresses, which I assume is their cold storage. Not money owned by Bitstamp itself. This suggests either new users, or wealthy users adding more coins to their accounts, but overall changes the ratio of coins in China v.s. coins in Europe.

If you mean transaction fee, it should almost always be 0.0001, but may be higher if the transaction is more complex, and thus takes up more space. For instance, if your address received 1BTC and you sent 1BTC, that's a very simple transaction, so takes the minimum fee. If your address received 0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.53, etc, from many different transactions, and you want to send 1BTC to someone, that transaction will require all the inputs that were received, and combine them into one output, even if its still all being sent from the same single address. Those multiple inputs that combine bitcoin pieces into one make the transaction more complicated, take up more space in the blockchain, and thus may cost a higher fee.

Not necessarily. He could have been creating coins out of thin air to get the cash that people traded for it (which his bots bought up). We know at least a few million of the cash was seized. He could also have been creating fake cash account balances with no real money behind it to buy up bitcoins from people who held their cash on the exchange (also with bots). So his own accounts could have been creating cash and bitcoin, trading against each other and others, and as long as barely anyone withdrew money, and the value of bitcoins kept going up, he could have been pumping up the fake wealth bubble all the way to $1,200.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:40:59


My stance is not that treating bitcoin as a currency in Forex is worse, it's that it makes it DIFFERENT. Whether that is worse, or better, it's still different.


It's more like, instead of having the main, biggest, most important attribute to predict with, there IS no attribute like that. So you have to use other attributes. Different.


It's not the issue of lack of information, it's HOW you evaluate risk. When you look at equities, you evaluate risk by reading corporate reports, and evaluate their financial position (debt/revenue), and future business plans. You can't evaluate bitcoin risk that way, because there IS no financial position (no debt, no revenue),  or future business plans. So, again, different.
They are only the same if you just take unknowns as a given, and trade stocks and currencies by just sticking your finger in the air and feeling which way the wind happens to be blowing at that moment. But that's basically gambling, not investing. Also, investing in bitcoin is NOT investing in unknowns. It's a completely different set of knowns, such as fixed inflation rate, technological adoption, investment by outside companies, new products coming out of bitcoin companies, etc. Again, different.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:23:35
There's no innovation there. They do their fraud prevention the exact same way they used to almost since the beginning, by tracking where and how your card is used, and letting you charge back purchases you don't recognize. That never changed. The only thing that did is that they now use computers to keep track of it instead of people.
Now compare that to multi-signature accounts, or cryptographic proof-of-reserves that bitcoin came out with.

Yep, this is FUD. Not because I don't care, but because this is fixable, and in the end would hurt GHash way more than they could hurt Bitcoin.
There's hardfork, there's patching clients to temporarily only accept and relay transactions from pools we all trust, there's forcing the attacker to play by the rules and keep the blockchain working even if they have 51% of the power, there's going after the actual pool and pool operators themselves, if things get too drastic...
Or there's just sitting back and letting miners that mine on these pools reorganize themselves over other smaller pools again, like they have done numerous times before. How many of these "51% Oh Noes!" threads will we have today, anyway?

Depends on whether bitcoin is traded out of at each of those transactions. If it's kept as bitcoin as it moves around, it shouldn't affect price, since everyone uses Supply/Demand based exchange prices. Once bitcoin becomes a unit of account, where everything is priced in bitcoin, then it may be different.

Er, I think you are forgetting that if you run a business and own a business account, which you use to buy inventory and pay salaries, you might very well have over $100k in your account. And even if you yourself are not poor, everyone you now have to fire because you don't have the money to keep your business running will sure as hell be poor from then on.
Having a job, and then losing your job because your employer had their money confiscated is very much a problem for ordinary people. And this actually happened.
Negative rates are for banks, but banks are in the business of making money. If they make positive rates on their holdings, which are actually **your** holdings, they will give your savings/checking account a positive rate. If they make negative rates on their holdings...

Not really. There aren't that many nodes out there, and you just have to have someone connect to you once to log their IP and address, then once again to log the same IP and a different address, at which point you can link the two addresses and everything in between through the chain on addresses on the blockchain. Bloom filters are very easy to break, too.
Your best option right now is Tor, or changing your IP every time, along with HD wallets. Will be even better with CoinJoin, at which point there will be no way for Mycelium to associate anything with anyone. But simply connecting to multiple nodes vs one doesn't give you any extra privacy assurances whatsoever. At least you have the option to connect to an organization you trust, as opposed to people you don't know. 
That said, Mycelium will be adding support for SPV nodes eventually (with a warning about being connected to untrusted nodes), and is trying to get the servers to be open source so you can run one at home too.

Our products have an agenda: Make bitcoin as easy, secure, and ubiquitous as internet itself, and everyone moves over to it.


Every problem (or almost every) has a solution at least. It just hasn't been implemented yet, either because it's still being coded in, or because it's not a high priority right now. Most people, newbies especially, don't know that those solutions are out there, and keep arguing that bitcoin is broken because some particular problem they discovered isn't fixed yet, and I point out that their problem discovery isn't new, and solutions already exist. That's my argument, and I'm still sticking with it.

I'd love to hear your ideas on what kind of value-add a service can add to the bitcoin itself. So far every bitcoin based stock and venture has underperformed the growth of bitcoin itself, so the goal would be to actually increase the amount of bitcoin in store, even if very little. If you can take 1BTC and turn it into 1.0000001BTC, regardless of how or of what kind if interest rates are out there, it's a valuable service.

If, as these guys are planning, their Realcoin gets picked up by banks, exchanging USD to/from Realcoin will be done right from your own bank account. Remember, if these guys get enough asset, audit, and bank backing and trust for their coins, no one will have to bother actually redeeming Realcoins for USD, and banks, after getting some from his company can just swap them for you, knowing that they can always redeem them back if they ever need to.

bitcoincard.org, but we had to remove solar charging and texting, and the battery doesnt support a full mesh yet (will be enabled when battery technology allows us to keep it on and transmitting all day long). We did make the circuit board, display, and battery fully flexible, and the card as thin as a credit card. The connector is also programmable, and can be made to work like a chip in Chip&amp;Pin cards, or as a card used for public transit, hotel key access, etc.
Expecting to start shipping by the end of this year. Originally hoped to ship in March, but ran into an unexpected hardware issue where flexing it too much caused it to short, so had to redesign the internals, thus the delay.

Sorry for the delay. When we first created the Indiegogo campain, we weren't sure how long it would take, so guessed October. We then received a lot of feedback and suggestions for improving security, which pushed us back to just after October, and the final delay was us moving to more secure metal cases from plastic ones, which we THOUGHT were all premade and would take a week or so, but were told it would take 6 :(
We should have the finished devices in within the next few days. At this stage, I'm printing out and folding the instruction inserts, we're setting up distribution points (Amazon), and as soon as the devices come in, the devs will flash them, box them up, and ship them out.
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:45:01
Nope. We don't even have that ability ourselves. When a buyer makes a request and starts a chat, he also initiates an encrypted P2P chat session that is encrypted using a key derived from the buyer's and trader's private keys. I think the buyer is the only one with the code and access to do that.  So we can't establish an encrypted chat session with them even if we wanted to.

@_date: 2014-12-25 19:50:58
Heh, you're silly


Because they both primarily transfer value from one entity to another?


Bitcoin can easily handle 80,000 transactions per second using just household hardware. It just isn't configured to, because the volume and demand for it isn't there, so there's no reason to enable any of that yet.


More expensive per transaction, not in total. Yep. No shit its more expensove to have accountants process transactions and transfer transfer requests and balances between two or three banks, instead of having the transaction go directly between two people, handled completely automatically by miners.


Only because the volume is so low, and the mining reward is so high. The amount of mining reward is not mandatory to be at some level for bitcoin to work. It can work fine for the entire world even at the current mining levels. The cost per transaction doesn't in create with the volume, since it doesn't cost much more to mine 4000 transactions versus 7. So, $14 per transaction while we have about 3 transactions per second? Means 3 ÷ 4000 = 14 = $0.01 per transaction if we get to 4000 transactions per second, regardless of how much money was transfered. Still WAY cheaper than 3% fee plus $0.15 per transaction.

They are provably secure. As in, the math behind them is understood and makes sense.
Very easy example of cryptography involves remainders. For example, 7 / 10 gives you a remainder 3. If my public number is 3 and my secret is 7, I don't need to "prove" that it's impossible to guess whether the private parts (snigger) are 7 and 10, or 6 and 3, or 299 and 302. It's just a a math, which shows that the solution to remainder 3 is an infinite selection of numbers, and you guessing that my secret is 7 is near impossible (especially if I use an enormous number).
The insecure part that may pop up is someone might discover a mathematical shortcut that would make finding a solution faster. But there is no outright solution for these things that just breaks the cryptography completely.

Sure, we had cheap energy, but thanks to inflation we ended up borrowing centuries worth of resources and using up that energy many times faster than we would have in a free market not manipulated by inflation (which also led to wars and even more waste).

Yes it does. Mainly because it's trivial to hide your financial activity. Just as it is trivial to hide your file downloading activity. Just as stealing used to involve actually going to a store and physically stealing something, hoping to not get caught, and now can be done from the privacy of your own home using hidden networks, financial dealings used to always have to go through banks, who report taxes, interest gains, and business activity on your behalf, meaning you have to work hard to hide any of it, and is now private automatically, without anyone knowing or tracking what you do, or filling government forms on your behalf.

It's more like 100M+, and I said money is half the requirement. If they buy all the companies manufacturing ASICs, which itself is questionable as to whether all ASIC companies would be willing to do something so questionable, it will take them over a year of manufacturing just to get the same amount of ASICs on the market. At the same time, since no one else is able to get ASICs, they become very pricey, making a huge incentive for new companies to start up and make more, meaning they would have to make not only more ASICs than already exist, but catch up to all the new ones being created. And at the same time they either have to sit on their ASICs and not use them, in hopes they will have enough to attack with a year or two from now, or they will have to keep using them to mine, pushing up the difficulty considerably, and losing a lot of money on very unprofitable mining.
So, money + time + more money + lots of risk.

What's byzantine about **the fact** that MtGox had at least two very good and popular competitors, which would have without a doubt taken most of MtGox's volume had they been allowed to continue to exist, thus very likely making the current MtGox problem be just a few thousand, maybe a few tens of thousands, of bitcoins lost instead of hundreds of thousands? The exchanges were popular, more convenient, and their volume was growing considerably, until regulations shut them down.

Can you give some examples of murder, rape, extortion, and theft where those are not wrong?
To us, anarcho-capitalists, they are wrong because they deprive you of your own property, that being both things you own, and your own body, which you also own. That's what the NAP is all about at its core: you own your own body, and the products thereof, and anyone imposing on your property first, without your permission is wrong by default. It's a pretty good rule that you can't really argue against, and everything else in anarcho-capitalism extends from that principle.
That said, since you think NAP is bullshit, I'd love to hear your arguments about how people SHOULD be allowed to initiate aggression and force against others when those others haven't done anything to anyone.

The whole "selfish miner will be ahead of the rest of the miners, working on the second block" never made sense to me, since bitcoin mining is not a progressive task. Every pick of a nonce has as much chance of being right as any other, so an honest miner is just as far ahead in finding the next block as the selfish miner once the selfish block is released. So the whole attack comes down to having a faster internet connection and Sybil attacks.

* Find a Linux USB installer you can run from windows (itself not a simple step)
* Download the file after finding the download link on the site
* Plug in empty USB stick (if you have one), run the file and pick a Linux distro to install (itself consists of a few steps)
* Download bitaddress.org to a second USB drive (if you have two, or to the Linux one if you don't)
* Reboot to the USB stick after figuring out how (not easy for most people, since Boot From USB is not enabled by default, and requires either holding F8 or F12 on boot, or changing bootloader settings.
* Once booted up, open bitaddress.org, and move mouse around to add some entropy (**which is less entropy that you get from Mycelium Entropy BTW).
* Connect your printer directly to your computer if it was connected through network before
* Print out the paper wallet (or switch to a different tab, then print, if the first bitaddress tab wasn't what you needed)
* Reboot the PC, and if needed, reconnect you printer back to the way it was.
A lot of those steps are easy, but not for those who aren't techy. Many of them are also time consuming, which people will simply not want to bother with. The steps with Mycelium Entropy are literally
* Unplug your printer from the network
* Plug in the Entropy device
* Once your printer shows that it detected a photo, hit print.
* Reset your printer and reconnect it.

The whole entire overall point of this whole discussion is that people online will take many more risks if they feel they can get away with it, and if the technology they are using them helps them to get away with it. P2P file sharing allows users to get away with sharing copyrighted materials. P2P cryptocurrencies allow users to get away with creating untraceable transactions. P2P file sharing has given us a history of it's effect on law v.s. opinion, where the opinion that "stealing" music is not actually stealing has won out, and has as a result affected the culture and ideas of the younger generation that has been using it the most. Tell kids to stop stealing music, and they'll laugh at you. In the same way, private money has a very high potential to change people's perception of law (report all your transactions, always report income, always pay your taxes) v.s. opinion (it's not wrong to keep transactions private, my income is my own and not being forced to give up some of it is ok, it's ok to skimp on taxes if I can easily get away with it), and lead another generation to not think of financial laws as ethically correct, just as people don't think intellectual property laws are ethically correct now.
What am I missing here? That because governments will become increasingly more hostile, will increase their surveillance, and will FORCE people to report their transactions and pay their taxes with ever increasing penalties for those who try avoid it, people will keep thinking that reporting and taxation are ok? (despite an ever increasing "us v.s. them" scenario)

I never deviated from saying they own the data centers. They don't. They rent space there and keep their miners there, along with other people's servers. The datacenters are big, but they don't own the miners they rent space to. The people who actually do own the miners, which they rent data center space for, typically do due diligence to make sure the miners they own don't go to a malicious buyer, because they spent a lot of money on their miners, and don't want them to become worthless paperweights.
Some of the miners are set up as private mining companies, where they DON'T rent their miners to anyone, mine on whatever pool they think will give them the biggest return, while avoiding 51% issues themselves, and sell stock in those future mining profits on the open market. But that also doesn't mean that whoever invests in those stocks has any more control over where and how they mine than the datacenters storing those miners. Either way, the actual owners of the mining hardware have the final say as to what their miners are used for, and don't want them to be used in a way that will make their investment useless.
Sorry I wasn't any more clear, or that this subject is so difficult for you to grasp.

It was that he got the conference to take his sponsorship money, that money was spent, and the organizers got screwed because of it, being unable to give it back, or cancel the conference.

Speculation is stuff like options, or betting on whether the price will go up or down. Investing is evaluating the potentials of a company or technology, and investing money in it in to both help it grow, and in hopes that it will grow and earn you money back. People who invested in things like Facebook, Twitter, and Google knew what they were investing in. They weren't speculating. The things you care and not care about is risk. You don't want the extra risk from investing in a company or technology that is not well established in, despite the higher risk possibly bringing a higher reward. You want a low risk investment, where the risks of fluctuation or failure are low (but still always exist), because the company is already well established. And that's fine. Different people have different risk tolerance, and different situations require different risk too (if you are 65, I wouldn't recommend moving your retirement to risky stocks, **even AmEx**)
Even if it's a Bitcoin-related business that is generating steady profits, that won't necessarily give you more security, since the business may still fail. Nor would it necessarily give you a better risk-vs-return than bitcoin itself, since if there is a bitcoin business big enough to be "safe" and generate a steady return, then chances are that by that point bitcoin itself is safe, steady, and is appreciating in value at a steady return. Point is, don't be picky in what specifically you are investing in. The only things that should matter are the risk you are taking, v.s. the return you are getting.

Property owners who's beach property was ruined. The same property owners who are now barred from suing BP, because US allowed BP to pay a small fine in exchange for legal protection.


And its customers, and its business partners, and if they cause damages, to those who sue them. If they get sued, and ignore the ruling against them, they will lose reputation among business partners and customers.


It starts out that way. Pretty much always it ends up being beholden to the companies that pay to elect its politicians.


Time. You can't make time go away, and that will always cost something. Chances are, such self-designing and thinking robots will be integrated with (into) humans; the same way we rely on calculators, we will rely on thinking robots to improve our intellect and creativity. But time to made and construct designs will still be limited, and people will pay a premium to get their stuff designed and done first. Resources to build things out of will also always be limited, so people will pay to have specific things built, and others won't be able to afford them, even with free robots.


It was almost 100% socialist. Private capital ownership was illegal, everything was owned by the public (or rather controlled and distributed by the government), everything created and earned was ultimately taken and controlled by the government, and all property, resources, and even jobs were assigned by central planners. Basically 100% of production was taken and redistributed.


You are confusing socialism with collaboration and contribution. Socialism is just *forced** collaboration and contribution. Capitalism is voluntary collaboration and contribution. Companies collaborate to create more and more complex things (such as multiple tech companies coming together to make an iPhone), and by creating better and cheaper products, contribute to the world and make life easier.


I'd say recently that would be people like Steve Jobs, Sergei Brin, Jimmy Wales, Alan Schaaf, Norman Borlaug, and others like that.

Oh, totally, but they won't have buddies in the government to print more bitcoins and bail them out, so it will be their last time doing it. Hopefully, in a system where government can't just step in and say "Nothing to worry about, WE'll take care of this!" these bankers, and their investors, will be a bit more careful about their business.


Yeah, I'm a bit shrill about it, but I hear the "My bank isn't charging me anything" often. It's not so much the "THEY ARE STEALING FROM YOU!" as just "IT'S NOT FREE!" Don't forget that banks invest up to 90% of whatever cash you deposit, and, as 2008 has shown, often in places where they will either make A LOT of money, or lose it all and get bailed out, as opposed to in actually sensible investments. Either way, we lose (either lost profit, or more taxes). Incidentally, I travel a lot, and one of the fun things to do when I'm in major cities is to check if all the tallest buildings I see around, in whatever city I am in, are indeed owned by banks, as they say. So far I haven't been disappointed.


My hope is actually that BTC will force "banks" to be actual banks, and "savings" to actually be called what they are: "investments." Specifically, I hope it will make people be aware that they are either depositing money into a safe storage account (100% reserve, or even multisig), or depositing it into an investment, where they can make informed decisions about how they risk their money. Instead of people depositing money into what they are told is a bank, but may actually be a government subsidized high risk investment for all they know. That's kinda why we hate banks so much, too. They lie, and then have us pay for their bullshit.


Heh, I think the BIGGEST chicken-and-egg problem was when bitcoin didn't have any value at all and couldn't be sold for anything, and no one wanted to sell anything for it because it was worthless. Thank god for that 10,000 pizza to get things going :)


I can kinda see why some would get that impression, but I don't think anyone ever really advocated that. Generally the discussion is "Bitcoin is useless because I have X" with the reply, "Bitcoin is much better than X because Y, and besides, not everyone has X." But the "bitcoin is better than X" counterargument would seem like "It's stupid to keep using X, just use Bitcoin" argument. And it's perfectly fine is merchants accept Bitcoin and VISA side by side, or even if VISA adopts bitcoin as its internal transfer mechanism. Especially since VISA isn't specifically dollars, or euros, or any other specific currency.

How much did I, or someone else, got richer from you saying "Box 401, Code 935-901-22"? Was that even a transfer of value, or just you letting people know where to send checks to?
Yes, a bitcoin ledger is similar to a bank account, but a bitcoin " word" actually literally transfers value, whereas banking account number just lets people know where to transfer money to, and requires them to give instructions to other people to **manually** do the transfer. By hand. Assuming they are willing to. A word =\= a set of instructions given to some people in charge.
If you think I am wrong, try to give me $0.25 worth by saying a word here using something other than bitcoin.

Mining is a service done by miners to secure the bitcoin transaction network. Right now the system pays for that service by providing a payout every block, as well as with the transaction fees people pay. Since bitcoin volume is low, the payout from transaction fees is also low, and thus miners are sustained by the block payouts. As bitcoin becomes more and more adopted, increasing transaction volume will mean increasing mining revenues from fees. Eventually, fees will pay for mining more than block rewards, and once all bitcoin is mined, miners will continue to secure the network, but make all their money from fees.

You need to pay a debt or bill on Monday before noon. What day do you set up the money transfer in your bank? What if you get paid on Fridays?
I ran into a problem related to this twice before, where I needed to transfer a few thousand to someone in order for them to have it the next day, found out I needed to do this in the evening after work (after banks close), and had no way of doing it short of taking time off work, driving down to my bank, getting out cash or cashier's check, and diving it to the person who needed the money. Sure it's rare, but it's still a PITA. On one occasion I even had a normal $6,500 transfer, to someone who was really dependent on it, frozen for two or three weeks, as the bank doing the transfer started demanding that I send them more ID stuff (like copies of drivers license and bills) to make sure I'm not a terrorist or something. Nearly caused the recipients to go bankrupt.

Our main competitor's bitcoin wallet ( also supports HD, and is a pure SPV mode wallet, not relying on servers. Though it's missing cold storage spending, Local Trader, and a few other features. We also use all HD standards, including BIP39, which is the dictionary library (I don't know if that one does).
As for the centralized servers, all they do is give you your balance, broadcast your transactions, and promise not to keep logs of your address balance requests. If you use an SPV HD wallet, there's no guarantee that some bitcoin node you connect to won't log all the addresses you ask balances of as your own (though there's no guarantee that we won't either). 
There IS one major benefit to having a centralized server that other wallets won't be able to do, though: CoinJoin. You need a central server to announce your intent to mix a transaction. We plan to implement that by default. The other more minor benefit is that our servers parse the 20Gb blockchain into a 100+ Gb searchable database, which means our wallets can get your account balances instantly, without taking up seconds (or even minutes) to rescan all prior transactions and addresses.

Oh, I know what the Petrodollar is. And I'm not denying that US is in big trouble, along with Europe. I'm just countering the idea that Russia is some sort of a superpower, when its whole economy is no bigger than a small European country or US state, and when most of its economy (70% of the GDP or so) is entirely dependent on oil and gas. If that oil starts to run out, or people switch to solar, or even if US starts pumping its own oil reserves instead of doing it in other countries, Russia could collapse very easily.

When forex trading, you take the issuing country and its politics into consideration, otherwise you're blindly throwing dice.
When treated as a security, the closest analogue is a corporate conglomerate that owns a bunch of diverse businesses. But even there you can't use the corpo's future business plans, or the behavior of CEO and boardmembers as guidance.
Store of value, maybe, but you store value in it because you know specific things that will guarantee that. Such as amount of gold mined per year vs held by governments who might dump it. There's a unique hodling reason here, based on technological adoption. It's like buying a whole bunch of TVs when they first came out, in hopes that televisions will become popular.
Other payment processors and money transmitters still transmit the same money the deal is done in. Here the payment and transmission entirely depends on the existence of a currency exchange, and requires the money to be swapped into a "foreign" currency before it is sent.
So, yes, it's very very close to what we already have, but different enough that you can't just compare it directly to something else and expect the exact same result.

There are a lot of mixed "total market" funds out there, that try to follow economies as a whole, or that try to plan towards a retirement date by adjusting a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. And even you look at the composition of specific funds, like Asia market or Large Cap, you'll see that they still hold some bonds, cash, and other stuff, even if it's a small percent. Personally, I'd be happy with even one fund, like Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, buying 1% into bitcoin to hedge, since that alone would be $3.5 billion.

Just a historical note, it suffered from hyperinflation because the guy elected to be in charge of the money supply would have been killed if he didn't agree to the demands to print more money. Him being weak and subject to whims of strong outside influences, leading to hyperinflation, was primarily what led Germans to elect a **strong** government that wouldn't be pushed around. So they elected Hitler. And that's why Germans are so freaked out about inflation and are so against it with regards to the Euro; in their history, inflations cause Hitlers.

Mining is creating a huge incentive to create processors that are as efficient as possible, and energy that is as cheap and efficient as possible to power them. In the long run, bitcoin mining may lead to much more efficient and sustainable global energy production, and much faster processor technology, that we would have had without bitcoin. At some point, if we reach solar power generation that is 90% efficient and costs pennies per square meter to create, we will simply cover every space we can with solar panels, and only be limited by available physical space in regards to mining and personal use power.

Carry your large amounts on a tiny credit card sized printout of a BIP38 encrypted private key QR code in your wallet.

The same thing that happened if the biggest exchange MtGox wasn't around. Someone else would step in to take over. If those companies suddenly went poof and disappeared, which is highly unlikely considering they are global, Dell or NewEgg could just write some code to accept bitcoin into any one of the world's dozens of bitcoin exchanges, where they can concert it to dollars themselves. BitPay and Coinbase just has an easy already-created API, and does the exchanging for you.

I don't believe that will necessarily be the case. TrustZone APIs, such as those being developed by Rivetz (and Ledger now) will make bitcoin on the phone secure enough to not need multisig. Plus at the same time as MultiSig is coming out, CoinJoin will be becoming more widespread, fitting multiple transactions into one.

Libertarian Austrians invented, developed, and supported Bitcoin for the last 5 years. Most of the people involved with bitcoin are Austrian Libertarians or Anarcho-Capitalists, because that's how the currency is designed: no central control, no inflation, no way to force it to submit to any economic regulation that Keynesian economics can not exist without. It basically forces the free market on those who use it.
Keynesians are the newbies in this group, who have mostly started to appear in bitcoin circles within the last few months, and are apparently insisting that the very people who created, developed, and currently maintaining bitcoin are "rabid Austrian teenagers ... that think they know what they're talking about, but really have no clue."

If you keep it at one of the new multisignature online wallets, if the company goes bankrupt, they still can't lose your coins without your signature, and you can still recover them. And with split keys, safeguarding your savings it easy. Store one at home, give one to your parents, keep one at work, and maybe give one to your friends and neighbors. They are all useless by themselves, but put a few of them together and you got your money out.


Yes. There are more cell phones in some African countries than people, even in places with no electricity, where they share solar panels to charge them up. The main reason is that internet and cell providers don't care about your risk - you prepay, you get service, you don't, you get cut off. Banks have to follow strict regulations, and it costs them a lot to set up branches in areas. There are cities in US where bank branches closed down and left the city without any access to banks after 2008, because the area was "too poor and not worth it." People living there still have cell phones they get at local Walmarts and 7-Elevens.


That's not how markets work with regards to "in circulation." They would actually have to be but on a Buy/Ask trading platform for them to be considered "in circulation" and affect the price. Though there may be short-term panics.


Bitcoin has a ton of advantages over the current financial system to. It's actually MUCH easier to use, since all you have to do is scan a QR code or click on a link, and hit send, as opposed to log into an account with username/password, and/or enter all your persona details. It's much easier for merchants to use, since they just have to show a QR code instead of log into their terminal with username and password, and store all credit card information **for 2+ years** using audited secured servers, and neither of you has to sign up for any accounts and wait sometimes days for approval.
For example, say we're all at a restaurant wanting to split a bill. We have smartphones, credit cards, and bitcoins, and the waiter refuses to split the check. We can't use credit cards to pay each other. We can log into our PayPal accounts, exchange e-mails, and go through its process to pay each other, or we can have one guy pay with a credit card, while everyone else just scans and pays to his QR code.
Or how about the process to create your own simple payment app, like, for example, a Reddit tip bot? With the current financial system, **you have to open a bank account in your own name** and accept deposits from others that wish to use it. Meaning you need a bank account, tons of regulations, and will require **everyone** who wants to use it to file identification forms so you can do proper KYC/AML. Even if no one will deposit more than $5's worth. Using bitcoin, it's just a few lines of code, and all the money is stored online.
Als, you are dead wrong on the "slower than current mechanisms to pay for goods." It takes a second for a credit card transaction to show up, and it takes a second for a bitcoin transaction to show up on a bitcoin network. If we use the Merchant Protocol, where the transaction is signed and given to the merchant to broadcast, it's even faster. **BUT** it takes 10 minutes for the merchant to actually get the bitcoins, and **up to two weeks** for a merchant to get his credit card payments deposited into his bank account. The speed of settlement, ease of use, ad most importantly, ease of new innovation, makes bitcoin way way better than anything we have had before it.


MySpace had few network effects, and no switching costs. Abandon Facebook for just two weeks, and you can leave it for good, without losing anything important. You can still contact your important friends using other methods. Abandon bitcoin, and you literally abandon money, or abandon a method of receiving payment, which you ma have put actual resources into setting up. Also, again, Myspace and Facebook are companies, not opensource shared technologies. If Myspace was an "open social network standard," instead of being abandoned, it probably would have been integrated into Facebook. Bitcoin is more like HTML in that sense. Yes, Myspace used HTML and died, but Facebook is still using HTML. Just as MtGox used bitcoin and died, but Coinbase is still using bitcin.


Almost everything, probably...


No, because it would be plainly obvious that the other technology is winning, as the price and adoption of bitcoin starts to slide down, and the other newer technology starts to pick up. This new technology would have to have such massive improvements that bitcoin isn't able to implement them in any way AND be so much better that bitcoin, being "good enough," would have to be abandoned. In other words, as they say, "it would have to be as better than Bitcoin, as bitcoin is better than the current financial system." So far noting has come along...

For the record, I was asking this guy to give me details of what was going on in the chat, and he never bothered replying aside from the initial complaint and two screenshots that didn't show anything other than his address and 0 balance. During this discussion I repeatedly asked him to e-mail our iOS dev at ios (I repeated this three times throughout the few days that this discussion took place). I am only on the chat to be aware of any Mycelium related discussions and help when I can, but that's not our tech support chat (it was a Mycelium group on Telegram created by Bruce). We did not receive ANY emails during this time. When we finally received an e-mail at the end of this (Wednesday evening, when this whole thing actually started Monday morning), it was sent to info which goes to our Android devs and does not include our iOS guy. I was unavailable when it was sent, so one of our Android devs found it eventually and forwarded it to ios later in the evening, but by then the iOS dev was already gone, and wouldn't be able to get back to it until some time Thursday (which is when Bruce helped him fix it).
So, basically, this guy told us something was wrong, wasted almost a week of not answering any of our questions or bothering to contact the iOS developer, and only eventually got help from his friend (Bruce). We STILL don't know what the heck happened, because our request for an explanation, so that we can troubleshoot this problem and make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else, was only replied with "Bruce probably understands what happened better." Bruce hasn't gotten back to us either.
So, PLEASE, if you have issues with our wallet or our devices, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE follow instructions, contact the right people, and reply to our questions. We can't help you if we have no idea what's happening with your phone.

Some exchanges have their own implementations, using bitcoind only to download and sync the blockchain database. For example, Mycelium uses bitcoind to download the blockchain, but then parses the whole thing into its own custom database, and does all the commands on that custom database using their own implementations. If something changes in bitcoind, it wouldn't change how Mycelium wallets behave.

From what I understand, unless your phone is rooted and apps are given elevated privileges, Android keeps all apps and their memory completely segregated.

It's by default. Instead of a Bitcoin address, you have a bitcoin account, and you send and receive to it same as you do with bitcoin addresses - scan, enter amount, hit send. Only difference is that the address itself will change in the background every time you request a payment (it will provide an unused address), and every time you send someone money (it will create a brand new address to send all your change to). So your addresses will be changed around without you even knowing. And instead of backing up a private key, you just write down 12 to 24 words to be able to restore all these addresses. Add CoinJoin as a default feature, and bitcoin will become almost completely anonymous.
P.S. Mycelium Wallet for android will be releasing that change soon.

Convoluted? Exchange uses proof of reserve to show how much is in their hot wallet, publishes the cold storage bitcoin address of their reserve showing how much they are self insured for, and signs the address to prove they own it.
How do you know the bank you are trusting is FDIC insured? Because they told you so? How much does FDIC have in reserves to protect you? How do you know if your bank is first, fifth, or twentieth in line to get an FDIC bailout if a few banks fail at approximately the same time? Yes, the claim is "insured up to $200k," but those reserves are not for 100% of the banks, and were actually **completely depleted** in 2008. If something like that happens again, maybe you'll get your $200k back, or maybe you'll have to wait a few months for the Fed to print you new dollars. Hell, lack of insurance reserves was the main reason for the 2008 financial collapse.
Conversely, click to check proof of reserves, click to check the balance of the signed address, and if the former is greater than the later, you're good to go. Best of all, you know that there is 100% insurance reserve instantly available should anything happen.
As for self vs pool insurance in general, what would you rather have, $300,000 coverage you pay $50 a month to some company for, in hopes that they give you the money you need when you file a claim? Or $300,000 in your own low risk investment account into which you add $50 a month, paying yourself, which you have instant and unfettered access to whenever you need it, and can keep and use for anything else you need if it turns out you don't need it for insurance purposes?

It's really hard to track this if you actually use bitcoin in your day to day spending, or if you use LocalTrader or LocalBitcoin to trade bitcoins. Your dollar cost averaging might assume that you just bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin, adding that to the total you have ever bought, that that may have actually been you selling $1,000 worth of bitcoin for cash with one trader, and buying $1,000 worth back from another to make a profit on the spread. For example, my tracking app claims I have "invested" tens of thousands into bitcoin at this point, but I know that's absolutely not true. Most of those investments was just be rolling coins through exchanges and local traders.

We're getting the back end finished up to recognize and correctly process the transactions, but the wallet side will take quite a while longer. For one, it would require a different HD account type that generates addresses starting with 3 instead of 1, so we'll need to figure out whether to mix the addresses together and keep them in the same account, or create a whole separate one.

Users (running nodes, wallets, and other bitcoin software) have to accept the fork too, not just developers.

Exchanges don't trade on the bitcoin blockchain, but on their own internal accounts. MtGox didn't have their bitcoin addresses publicly known, so no one knew how many bitcoins they actually had on deposit. They created fakenbitcoins by having a not increase the balance of bitcoins in its account, and selling it for cash on the exchange. As long as people didn't withdraw those coins, no one would know they were fake.
It's because of them that we now have a thing called Proof-of-Reserves, and demand that exchanges prove that they have the bitcoins they claim to have.

Due to the drop in Bitcoin price reducing enthusiasm, quite a lot of conferences had a loss this year. In case you misunderstood, I didn't mean conferences are run at a loss intentionally, but rather that conference revenues are based on attendance, attendance is very hard to guess, and a lot of conferences guessed too high, and didn't earn back what they spent on the conference itself. Rumor is that the Texas Bitcoin Conference from last spring was $500,000 in the hole.


He likely didn't, but attendance at the Chicago one was a bit lackluster, so he may have lost a bit there. But whether you lose money or not, you learn, borrow money, and get again, hoping to do better next time. And regardless of whether he made money last year, there is no guarantee he will make a profit this year. Bitcoin price is down again, so enthusiasm is down, holders may not want to spend, and boycotts may keep ticket sales down. So, ironically, boycotting his conference may be forcing him to hold the money he got even more.


We don't know if all premium sponsors were $30k, or if they were $10 to $30k. We also don't know the costs of the venue, marketing, materials, A/V team and equipment, electricity, internet, basic equipment like desks and chairs, snacks, security, employee salary, and whatever else is required to run this conference. But if you can do the math, I'd love to see it. My own estimates are based on experience. For instance, having electricity run to a vendor table costs $150 to $250 a day. Wireless internet access is up to $2000. Snacks, like hors d'oeuvres consisting of small rise balls or pigs in a blanket (sausage wrapped in pastry) can cost $3 to $6 per piece/ball. A venue like a small theater with a single room can cost from $20,000 for the cheap one, to as much as $100,000 for a slight after one in a good location. Conferences are ridiculously expensive, because venues know they can change you whatever the hell they want. You don't have much choice, since there are so few of them.
Btw, I think your name may be what's getting you banned.


I agree, it is at worst a scam, and at best, if Josh isn't a scammer, an extremely incompetently run project by someone without understanding of finance and economics, on par with Venezuelan central bank. After reading the Coindesk article on it, I could tell right away that there is no way it could work, unless either Josh or the people buying Paycoins would lose most of their money. But why promote it? It was just another altcoin with a different idea when it was signed up for sponsorship, probably no different from Ethereum or Maidsafe, who were also sponsors are some conferences. And once the scam accusations came out, just a few weeks ago I might add, it was too late to do anything. I know Moe isn't in this to milk people out of money, since I know him well, and I kinda feel bad for him being stuck in his situation.

Probably because the idea that he wouldn't sign on a known scammer for a sponsor, that sponsorships were sold and on his site way ahead of time before this whole thing exploded on Reddit, and that sponsorships are legal contracts, are obvious? It's strange I have to keep pointing that out to people here.
He wanted to do an AMA, but doing it now would have been a bad idea, with any of his responses buried deep under trolls and downvotes. This subreddit isn't exactly rational right now, as with things I pointed out should be obvious, but people don't seem to get, and instead are piling on the "He is willingly supporting a scammer, and is thus a scammer himself" bandwagon.

There is absolutely nothing that Mycelium servers can do to steal your money. And while you have no way to know for sure that were not logging any transaction (besides whatever is already logged in a public bitcoin ledger), you have even less assurances when using a full SPV client. We at least make a promise staked on our reputation, while a random node you connect to can log everything, including your addresses and IP. If a law enforcement agency leaned on us, there isn't anything they can get that they can't get from any other bitcoin node. Our wallet also supports Tor with a hidden service, so if you use that, we won't even know your IP. There is simply no way to conduct any surveillance even if we wanted. I don't think there is any Android wallet with more privacy than Mycelium.
We didn't enable Tor by default because it requires a third party app, and because using Tor is slower than clear net.

Blocks are actually at 100%+ capacity. The only reason they look like at 70% is because some pools set a software limit of 750kb blocks, and some pools mine 0 transaction blocks while they wait to download the recently mined block. Long term average makes that look less than 1mb, but the blocks are pretty much filled up completely now.
What's wrong with hard forks? We need one right now regardless of whether we'll need one a year from now. What we decide to do later makes no difference on whether that fix is needed ASAP. But so what is block sizes grow? Even the fee market isn't ready yet. How many wallets support replace by fee? How many support parent pays child fee to get stuck transactions through?

If that were true, why is web and PC security so lax, and only Bitcoin wallet developers seem to be focusing on near-paranoid levels of security?


Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet, Blockchain, Hive, Coinbase, KNC Wallet, GreenAddress, and these are just ones for your phone. How many private key apps are there for PGP or SQRL, and what kind of development is being done on those? (I think there's only 2 PGP apps and 1 SQRL app for Android...)


Actually it does. As you say, bugs need to be patched. If something isn't actively developed, bugs can stick around and be undetected. The most serious bug is leaking key security. That is being constantly checked and improved in Bitcoin apps. New features, such as BitID, multisig, HD, and other stuff is being added to wallets constantly, too, since wallets are actually competing against each other to get better and more secure - something also absent with PGP and SQRL development.


The problem is that Bitcoin developers **will NOT** spend their time developing some unrelated third-party app. So that "better spent" time would have to come from somewhere else. The reason is because they would have to implement a whole separate key management system to use with SQRL, which is way more time consuming than using the already implemented Bitcoin message signing, and which they have absolutely no reason or incentive to bother with.

PoS is neither. The whole premise is that if you have a stake, you won't do anything to lower the value of your stake, such as by inflating it. But banks, which have a huge stake in dollars, just devalue them and convert those dollars into other assets. As a PoS owner, I can just devalue the currency, convert it into, say, land, devalue it more, get more land, and so on, making the currency become more and more worthless perpetually, while getting control of more and more of some other asset. As long as I don't convert more than half of what's devalued into another asset (I own X, I give myself 2X, I spend 1X, I still have X stake), I can do this for ever. Which is what the established fiat financial system has been doing. That's why I say we already have a PoS, and it would be better to decentralize mining from holding.

How valuable are chargebacks to you when you shop at Amazon, Target, Walmart, or any other large established retailer?  Because for me they are useless, since I know I can always return the item. As for smaller retailers, if chargebacks really are very valuable for consumers, then consumers will just pay for them in the form of fraud insurance or multisig arbiter.


So? Who cares? We're nowhere near using that up, and it will be raised to 80/second soon, then more as needed.




I send a signed transaction to merchant through BIP70, merchant tacks on a fee, and transmits it directly to mining pools whom he has a contract with, who agree not to accept any other transactions from the same address the merchant submits. Double spends almost impossible, since miners will reject any attempts to do it. Where's the centralization?




Who cares? See previous paragraph.


No, by the time 44,000 txns/sec are needed, blocks will be big enough to accept them.


Block doesn't have to propagate, just transactions that are being broadcast and the 80kb header hash. Thesis being implemented now, where once you mine a block, all you broadcast is the 80k header, since all other nodes and miners have heard of the broadcast transactions already.


Don't listen to him. You would pay bitcoins, and no one, including your boss, will know you are buying dildos. Bitcoin is plenty anonymous (look how many millions of dollars worth were stolen, and how many were recovered), and many of those anonymizing features are being built into consumer wallets to work by default in the background.


Except for in countries who use it to settle payments of hundreds of millions of dollars (China, India, Russia, likely a few European countries sometimes)


It would still waste less electricity and resources than banks. Mining also creates a huge incentive to get as much power for as little as possible, since efficient miners can earn more than wasteful miners, so miners will be forced to create more efficient renewable electric generating technology (mining for free on wind, wave, and solar), which will be used by everyone else. Miners also already created a huge push to get 24nm processor tech out almost a year sooner than planned (was supposed to come out inNovember, ASICs got it out in March), so mining will give us faster processor too.
 &gt; And its a highly inefficient solution which requires 1000 computers with power consuming GPUs
GPUs!? What is this, 2011?


Check your prices again. WU is higher than you claim. Also note that PayPal doesn't even let you send to most of the world. Places like India and much of Eastern Europe only allow sending money within the country, not receiving it from abroad.




You forgot things like owning value by holding private key, multisig, notarizing with the blockchain, micro transaction channels, it being the first time software can hold and spend money on its own, and probably a dozen other things.


I assume you can math, right? So what is
1 * 25 vs 20,000 * 0.00125
Are those numbers the same? The first is 25 transactions each paying a whole bitcoin fee. The second is 20,000 transactions paying a 0.00125 fee. See where I'm going with this? The fees OR the volume has to go up, and if adoption increases, the volume will go up.

What if I am not interested in bitcoin or holding it, and am only interested in earning a profit? If I mine, I am earning. Moreover I'm earning first, paying expenses second. If I just buy bitcoins, I am not earning anything. Moreover I have no money to buy bitcoins with, since I can't just borrow something like electricity which I can pay for later.


That's not how markets work. If this was the case, I would just continue to sell my bitcoins for $1,000 now. When you sell bitcoins, you sell for whatever the market will give you, or go bankrupt for not being able to pay for your electricity and whatever you borrowed to buy your miners. Miners aren't the only ones selling bitcoin after all. Think of it this way, corn costs about $0.25 a husk on the market, and there are millions of them being grown out there. If you buy an expensive plot of land in Manhattan, use expensive fertilizers, and pay wealthy bankers to tend it for you, you could end up with form that costs $1,000 per husk. But it will be no different from any other corn. So why would someone pay you $1,000 for yours, when they can pay $0.25 for anyone else's?

No they didn't. All that happened is the huge influx of companies sucked up all the available labor. Used to be every time a factory opened in China, there was a line outside the fence of hundreds of workers. Now the gates are empty, because everyone is working, so companies have had to compete to steal each other's employees, with higher salaries, benefits like food and housing, etc. In India things got so bad that employees there now earn wages comparable to those in US, and India is no longer affordable to outsource to. And regulations have nothing to do with it.

Multisig isn't any more complicated (check out GreenAddress). It's basically the same as an online wallet you use on your phone, but your phone itself has to sign a transaction together with the online server. To the user it's no different from Blockchain.info or Coinbase. So chance are that average users who are paranoid about security will want someone countersigning on their transactions, same as they got used to banks checking their transactions.

The math is very easy. Let's say the amount of hashing power remains the same, needing to produce 3975 to be viable, and the fee stays at the same low rate of 0.0001 BTC. That meant that there need to be 3975 ÷0.0001 = 39,750,000 transactions per block to make up the same reward. That divided by 10 then 60 is 66,250 transactions per second. By the time transaction rewards go away 100+ years ago, if bitcoin replaces all credit cards and money transfer systems by that time, that is very possible.

If you have Android, install Mycelium Wallet, and use the Cold Storage option from the menu. It let's you check normal and BIP38 keys and their balances (and even spend from them) withouts adding it to storage or exposing it to anything but temporary protected memory. You can also add the bitcoin adresses (public) to your list of addresses as a watch only address.

There are no issues with Base58 keys. It's just a regular key, with a checksum at the end, so you can manually enter it and make sure you don't screw it up with a typo. It's the main way to back up keys to paper, which is the best way to store a key securely. Handling keys in files by saving those files somewhere is not as safe or durable, so yes, it's the gold standard.
Do you have a link to that someone in another thread? We want to evaluate all potential issues and threats, and want to see what he says.

Banks knew they were junk loans, but they priced interest rates to account for it. If the ratings agency actually labeled them as junk bonds, or bothered to do some risk analysis on what kind of bonds were bundled with what, or if the other banks actually bothered to track what they were buying (which I guess is the fault of banks being stupid), then everyone would have been paying correct prices for the risk they were buying. The overall simplification is really that the risk was not priced correctly in the whole system, and both ratings agencies and credit default swap sellers were the main culprits for mispricing that risk.

No, but I and everyone else who is unhappy would remain on a 21 limit chain that would retain value while the other chain would inflate and depreciate. Economics would make my chain win. Heck, a 21mil limit increase isn't even a fork, really. It's a whole new coin.
Who the hell bought Bitcoin with the consent that it will cost them more and more to spend their own money?
Also, minor changes like this can't not have consent after the fork happens. Miners and investors will pick one of the forks and let the other die, because there's no incentive to keep both forks going (unlike in a keep or increase 21 mil scenario).

He took and spent the money before he knew it was a scam. Money that went to pay for things already. Specifically things that should make this conference possible and enjoyable for the attendees. Don't screw him because he tried to do something good for the community, and got swindled by the scammer too.
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:27:37


That's not possible. Sponsorship is a lot of money, and all of it was already spent on the venue and other stuff. Conferences aren't free to put on. Typically you go in debt as you set them up, in hopes of getting enough money to repay it from last minute ticket sales.

Depends on what they use it for. If they are using bitcoins to sell through LocalBitcoins, they can easily make that interest back and more. If they are using it to invest in cloud mining, you may be investing in a ponzi through a borrower as arpxy. Some well established users are in other countries, where getting a bank loan is not easy, and the APR they get through BLC is about 20%, which is not unreasonable for an unsecured loan.

And yet, HOLY FUCKING SHIT THEY ARE BEING DISCUSSED! 
What whadayaknow? And yes, every single one of those issues is either totally wrong, or has a solution just waiting to be coded, tested, and implemented, but not done yet because there's no need for it yet. Perhaps if trolls spent 1/50th of the time they spent on posting in and trolling people here with the same old complaints actually researching and looking for answers to their concerns, they would figure out that may of them have had solutions for almost three years now.


Bitcoin incentive is cheapest energy + fastest silicon. Cheapest energy means miners, in order to compete, will try to use, and create, the most efficient ways to get their power for as little money as possible. Right now that is hydro in West US and geothermal in Iceland. Eventually it may be solar, wind, wave, etc. This push to create cheapest way of getting energy will propagate to the rest of us who will get access to cheap and likely reusable energy too. Much in the same way that ASICs have sped up the development of 24nm silicon by almost a year, where it was scheduled to be available in October or November, but ASICs got it out way back in March. Efficient electricity and faster processors in the long run is a benefit, not a problem.


That doesn't mean bitcoin is broken, that just means that currently the setting is set at ~4Txn/s, since that's all we need right now, and will be set to a higher setting when we need it (hard forks are not a problem either)


That's only because of the block subsidy and lower transaction volume. That cost is fixed, so if transaction volume keeps going up ([as it has been]( cost per transaction will go down. This cost is also completely meaningless when you take price fluctuations from adoption into account. The cost currently is expressed in Bitcoin's 10% inflation rate, but if adoption is also happening at 10%, then the bitcoin price doesn't move, the price per transaction is ~$0, and that $13 is just opportunity cost.
Note that all three of these questions are anywhere from 2 to 3 years old, and have been answered here  and here 
No, bringing these questions up is not trolling, but bringing them up over and over again after they have been explained and answered ad nauseum is. Especially when that is pretty much THE running theme on your own subreddit, spoken as if it is the absolute truth, and the ultimate nail in the coffin for bitcoin. This is basically the equivalent of confronting Libertarians/AnarchoCapitalists with an "obvious AHA question" of "who will build the roads."

Then people will buy bitcoins, convert them to sidechaincoins, and sell them for bitcoins, driving the bitcoin price up as they buy it, and driving the sidechaincoin price down as they sell it.

I helped run plenty of conferences. I do have an idea.

That really depends on the quantity and how it's stored, doesn't it? Someone having a whole lot of black powder bullets in their home technically has the equivalent of many pounds of dynamite, too, and sending 14lb through the mail can be either a large 14lb explosive, or dozens of tiny mostly safe shipments. Besides, it's not illegal to send hazardous materials through the mail. You just have to package them appropriately, and declare and label them as such.

Mycelium uses the BIP32, BIP39, and BIP40 standards for HD wallets and mnemonic seeds. So any wallet that uses those will be able to restore your addresses. For now that's only Trezor and maybe Wallet32, but Electrum and DarkWallet should be switching to those standards soon too.

These scam accusations came out way after the sponsorship was bought, and the money was spent on the venue.

If you are serious about wanting to convert literally millions of dollars, your best bet is OTC market with some of the bigger whales in the community. I may be able to put you in contact with them (rassah (at) xnicole.com). Otherwise, if it's just small amounts over a long period of time, those three options in your edit are best. LocalBitcoins has the benefit of seller feedback that you can depend on to possibly trade over wire instead of in person, but Mycelium LocalTrader has the benefit of your bitcoins never leaving your phone.

You have two options. Have the conference ban Garza, and you raise money to pay for their lawyer fees after they are sued for breach of contract, or raise money that Garza paid for the sponsorship, which the conference spent before they knew he was a scammer, so they could return his money and cancel his sponsorship.

Ah, that explains it. In USA they are not free. So, banks like Cities, Wells Fargo, Chase, and CapitalOne still give free checking in EU?

Also makes me wonder about those negative interest rates imposed in Germany, and if that may become the norm all over UE too.




Yeah, check out PayPal's own list of supported countries. You'll notice that a majority of them are limited to only sending money within the country. Pretty much the only places PayPal and credit cards are allowed to be used to send payments to are most of Europe, North America, Australia, and some well established parts of Asia. Russia, Middle East, Eastern Europe, most of Asia, and probably all of Africa is blocked now, only accessible by expensive wire transfers or Western Union.


First of all, that's a falaciou claim based on the "technology does not get adopted" claim. That same claim could be used against email (no one has email), cars (no one sells gasoline), and everything else. And yet, it doesn't disprove the original claim; sending email to someone else who has email IS easier than sending them a letter.
And second, I shop at Target, Sears, and other established chains. So I don't know why I need more shops, if I can get everything I need almost anywhere I go.


Bitcoin wallets supported NFC long before ApplePay came out. The only steps are, bring phone to NFC terminal, and hit send once you confirm the transaction. You have one extra step of making sure you are being charged the right amount, but I doubt people would complain. Those who do can just use an NFC debit card issued by someone like Xappo, where your bitcoins are stored on their system, and sent out as payment instantly.


That's true, but you don't get to claim that bitcoin is worthless because **you yourself** happen to have a good bank account. It's the old bitcoin criticism of "No one in the world needs bitcoin, because I have a credit card."

He doesn't have the money to give back. As for cancel the conference, that would be nuts! Probably close to 1000 people have nonrefundable plane and hotel tickets bought for this already. It would be a horrible thing for him to do to screw so many more people just because he got screwed by this scammer himself.
Also, the organization running this is a nonprofit. Moe doesn't make a profit on this. He can only take losses.
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:00:48
What about the option of following the law and legal contracts in a case where the scammer has not yet been charged or found breaking other contracts in court? Moe is a law abiding guy, not a freaking contract killer.
His only choices are to cancel the conference and pay for the large venue termination fee out of pocket, which he doesn't have, or break the contract and be on the hook for $30k plus lawyer fees, which he also doesn't have. Obviously the BEST option is to let the conference go on. A lot of people who don't give a shit about Garza are looking forward to it.
Yes, it's his fault for signing a sponsorship contract without doing a background check (or maybe he did, and there just wasn't anything wrong at the time it was signed), but he's not a scammer himself, and the conference shouldn't be ruined for the rest of us because of it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:20:43

They'll need to focus on their payment processor thing a bit more. For now they just have a button you can accept payments with.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:54:10
At this point he's a know scammer. At the time he wasn't. I'm sure in the future he will have contract provisions for something, but keep in mind, "known scammer on Reddit" is not a legal definition fraud that let's one get out of a legal contact. The scammer would have to be sued in actual court, not internet court.
Either way, it's not as if Moe planned to support a known scammer, and is now willingly supporting a known scammer, as people seem to claim to be. He got screwed by the scammer and is in an unwinnable situation - a victim of this scammer too.
The conference run by a nonprofit does not make much of a profit. They are unlikely to make as much as they got in the sponsorship. And even if they did, they would get sued as soon as they canceled the sponsorship without paying for it, and then would have to use the profits to pay it back (which they probably won't have enough for) and have to pay legal fees and fines on top of. It's not as simple as people here keep saying.
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:36:27

"One guy that paid for a sponsorship a long time ago turned out to be a scammer! Burn everyone, and any companies involved, even if they just bought nonrefundable sponsorships and had nothing to do with it too!"
Yeah, that sounds rational. You know how many scammers are allowed to speak on Reddit? Why aren't you boycotting this, and equating everyone on this subreddit to be just as bad?
Fact is conference organizers have to focus on organizing the conference, and have little time to deeply vet everyone who is willing to support them financially. Sometimes they sign someone up, and they later turn out to be a scam. How many conferences has BFL, or Neo&amp;Bee? Or other outfits we now know to be scams, as sponsors? Should we burn all those conference organizers at the stake too? Or avoid having any other conferences on the off chance that the money used to make it happen and bring people together could come from a scam?
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:21:35
You have no idea. Organizing a conference isn't just collecting ticket money. It's a lot of work going to venues to pick out a good one, negotiating prices and services, planning out schedules and speakers... It's not easy and you don't get a lot of free time. If someone claims they are a big important bitcoin business, point you to a nice site, and give you sponsorship money, you generally don't spend the next few hours digging through forums and subreddits to see if you can dig up dirt on them.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:44:33
I'm from the planet that let's me look on the website to see which organization is running this conference, research it, and find out that it's a nonprofit.
I didn't deleted my account. I just got promoted to special status for explaining how to get around downvote restrictions. 
As for how much in getting paid? None. Hell, I even paid the full conference and table fee to attend and show my company's products, and hope to volunteer to run a help table, answering bitcoin questions for newbies. I'm doing this because I know Moe, the guy in charge of this conference, know that he has more integrity than most of the people on this subreddit, and am willing to take a bit of flack on his behalf.

It is, yes. Ideally all (or most) old balances should be zero, being spent, so just the fact that they have spent outputs is what is being tracked.


I'll ask our iOS dev to check in on this. In Bruce's case, it sounds as if he created a bunch of empty addresses that have no activity at all, not just 0 balances, and since some of his customers have not paid anything into them, that zero activity is what is preventing him from making any more addresses.
Mycelium Android version scans ahead 10 addresses for activity, not balances.

No they won't. Remember all the scams that were happening over the last few years? Online wallet services that would get "hacked" and run away with money? People running bitcoin "banks" that were outright ponzis? Exchanges that would disappear because the funds were lost, which turned out to be scams too? Every time that happens, the community learns a lesson, and new precautions are set up (such as Proof-of-Reserve). People will learn from this too, and without relying on regulators that tend to fail all the time too. Free market woo indeed :D

* A bitcoin transaction takes ten minutes, while for VISA it's instant.
* There is no way to get around the 10 minute limit, so you will have to wait 10 minutes at the cash register when buying groceries.
* Bitcoin can't scale because it's limited to 4-7 transactions per second.
* Bitcoin wastes too much electricity and creates too much polution, and will keep wasting more and more as long as it exists.
* Bitcoin is not secure because anyone getting 51% of the mining power can completely destroy bitcoin.
* Miners control bitcoin.
* Bitcoin fees will have to grow to enormous size to support the network if block rewards keep decreasing or go away.
* Bitcoin doesn't offer anything new that can't be done by a credit card.
* Bitcoin will never be adopted because it's too difficult to use.
* Bitcoin needs to be backed, otherwise it will always be volatile.
Probably many more I'm forgetting.

If I need to send money to a friend or family member, and they won't get it until morning despite it saying it was processed tonight, damn right we will notice the difference!
At one point my parents got screwed by the government shutdown and didn't get their paycheck on the day they were expecting it, but had a $3,000 bill to pay the next day. They called to see if they could borrow it at 6pm. I had the money, but there was no way I could transfer it to them that same evening, or even the next day without taking some time off work to pull cash out by going to the bank (regular bank transfer would have taken 3 days)

As an economist, I'm just pointing out that the ratings agency is to blame here. Fairly simple - if ratings agency had done its job (or not lied), those bonds would have either been priced correctly, or the credit default swap insurance would have required premiums high enough to cover any losses should they have failed, which would have also added a massive price to the risk of holding them.

For it to become dominant world currency one of two things can happen:
1. Bitcoin becomes more popular and more useful than USD and EUR, and people move their money out of those currencies into bitcoin, causing a [Speculative Attack]( where the old currencies fall very quickly
2. Bitcoin just keeps chugging along, fixing problems as they happen and adding features as new ideas come up, thanks to it being open source and supported by everyone, and simply outlasts other currencies by being more resilient and not susceptible to inflation and inflation-related collapses. Don't forget that the average lifespan of fiat currencies is about 27 years. USD has just been lucky. So in this case, for bitcoin to become a dominant currency it just has to outlast the others, not actually take them over.
For bitcoin to NOT become a dominant currency, it would have to either:
1. Fail so spectacularly that there is no way to fix the technology/software behind it, which is somewhat unlikely, since even if it completely breaks and stops working for a few days, there are enough interested parties (people with wealth who own bitcoin) to get it fixed, booted up, and working again by any means necessary (even if it means switching hashing algorithms, switching to PoS, or something else)
2. Not be able to keep up with technological innovation of other cryptocurrencies, where some other cryptocurrency manages to both overtake bitcoin in innovation AND in end user convenience and network effect.
And note, in both those scenarios, USD and EUR are still not present.

I think he's just freaking out that he got into such a nasty hole. I imagine the amount he owes is about a normal **yearly** salary in India. He's still talking to his investors on lending sites, too, and has a really good borrowing reputation, haviging repaid a lot of loans, so I don't think he's a scammer. Just sucks that Paycoin screwed him, he screwed lenders by proxy, and now he's in trouble because of Paycoin too.

This is a fairly good analogy to what happened in 2008, but this is not economics. The main culprit in 2008, and in this example, is the ratings agency that rated those bonds AAA, which insurance relied on to cover any investment losses. Had the ratings agency actually done its job, or the insurance actually properly priced the risks, charging enough premium to cover losses, none of the 2008, or this example, would have happened.
So, this is not economics, as much as an example of over-reliance on a single agency to tedermine whether something should be trusted, as opposed to doing your own diligence.

FYI, Moe's original idea for his non-profit organization that puts on these conferences is to have them be as cheap as possible, so normal users who may be curious about bitcoin can attend, and companies who deal with bitcoin could sell and promote bitcoin and their products. At the beginning he was even hoping to have the conference paid for entirely by sponsors and merchants, and have free entry for anyone walking off the street, but that turned out to not be possible with the high expenses of venues and other conference related stuff. He still wants these conferences to bring bitcoin to as many people as possible. That's why his conference ticket prices are so low (and maybe why sponsorships are so high and needed so much).

If you have that money/bitcoin in your account, that is the literal definition of reserve. If the exchange's policy is that the money deposited into your account is yours, that would also supersede any claims on your money by other borrowers.


You can't really run a ponzi while proving reserves, either, since a ponzi requires money from new accounts to go into old ones, and Proof-of-Reserves would show that the new ones don't have all the money in them any more. If a ponzi shows 100% proof of reserves, that means that everyone is able to pull out all their money at the same time without loss.


Proof-of-Reserves works by letting you reconcile your own balance with what the proof shows the exchange has in their account. That's all that anyone should care about: that there is cryptographic proof that 100% of their share of the money is in their account. If there were fake orders with fake bitcoins, this cryptographic proof show an amount less than 100%, since everyone's money would be spread among both real (their own) accounts and fake ones. And, again, for liabilities, if the exchange policy (contract) is that the money in your account is yours, those liabilities would have to come from money owned by the exchange (their own profits).

Moe doesn't have cash to count. I don't even know if this conference will break even, since conferences trend to get lower attendance when bitcoin price drops.

He's not allowed to take in too much cash, otherwise it can kick him into a higher tax bracket and/or he could lose nonprofit status. He does these to help improve the bitcoin community, and get more people into bitcoin, not for cash.

FDIC is insurance, working like regular insurance, with panks paying premiums every quarter, and insurance money going into a pool. The US government just promises to bail it out in case it gets into trouble. Though the only way it can do that is by printing more money, meaning inflating the currency (backed by the full faith and credit of the US printing press), and by trying to replenish their reserves as fast as possible, meaning charging remaining banks higher fees, which then get passed on to everyone else. But there's a limit to how much that full faith and credit will be willing to print before it causes risk of too much inflation, or how much banks are able to afford.


Some people just had to wait a month or longer to get it, instead of the week or two it usually takes.
Either way, insurance is great, and being insured by someone who can create more of the thing being insured whenever needed is even better, but it still doesn't beat 100% self coverage. At least not in security.

When I did their finances for a conference a year ago, Moe took a very modest salary (just a few $k, which doesn't cover the amount of labor he puts into these imho) and rolled whatever money left into the next conference. The idea was keep using the process from prior conferences to help fund the next, so he could make affordable $100 or less per ticket conferences, instead of the $250 to $600 ones we often see.

I'd rather actually start selling the real thing (which I had hoped to do this weekend, but...), and every time we take another customer's money, I feel like here's another person who will have to wait a while longer. Plus we are really close to filling our first batch of orders with preorders, so if too many more people get excited and start ordering, they will have to wait for the next batch, which may be a few more months. I'm not a fan of taking people's money and forcing them to wait like BFL and Trezor did, and hate being in that situation too.

No. They only checked IDs for 21+ age, and some guy near the intrance was asking if you are with the conference, and if yes gave out coupons for a free drink. The tickets weren't even sold or given out until the next morning, and the party wasn't exclusive or closed off to others, so at least half the people there were just random people off the street. The dancers were the same ones that were there all week, and this weekend too. Honestly I'm not even sure what PayBase bought with this party, besides a projector to put on their bar roof, and a few exclusive seats in the front.

Last year's conference disaster? What happened? I thought it was one of the best conferences of 2014, and it broke attendance records :/
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:29:35
It was from $33 to $2.50. It would have to be down to $96 for the same drop.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:45:23


You can't really get higher quality than what he has.


Where will that money come from?


I doubt he would have been able to sell 150 more tickets in just two weeks since this came out just from boycotters agreeing to come. I seriously doubt that many people even canceled from this, or will care. And do remember that all this only came out two weeks before the conference. If Reddit raised this stink in early December or January, maybe that would have been an option, but this was very last minute.


Those **are** the market value of those resources. I travel to conferences and get tables a lot, and often the conference organizer doesn't provide free electricity to vendors, so it costs me $150 to $250 to pay for it myself (conference organizers still lay for electricity for other things, like lights, their own registration desk, etc.) I ended up getting around the ridiculous ripoff by buying a marine deep cycle battery and an inverter for about $200, sticking it on a dolly (thing weighs 70 pounds), and taking it to conferences with me just to save money (if you see me, you'll probably see it under my table, though I'm not taking it to Miami this time).


That is true, but it also gives me access to private information no one else has. For instance I know what kind of person Moe is, I was there with him when he was planning the whole "let's make cheap conferences around the world to introduce people to bitcoin" idea, and I get some behind the scenes information for how things are going with the conference, though at most I can just drop hints about it (I'm not under NDA, but I respect Moe's privacy and business privacy).
He asked if he should to an AMAat the time this who!e thing was blowing up a week ago, and I advised against it since it would just result is a massive with hund, trolling, down voting, and a waste of his time, especially since he cant actually do what people are requesting anyway (drop Garza completely), and suggested that he wait until the storm calms down and people can ask questions with a clearer head. I don't know why he didnt bother doing an AMA later - maybe the personal communication to the conference email and continuing ticket sales made it seem like it's not a big deal after all, maybe things calmed down enough not to care any more, or maybe he got too busy and forgot, I don't know - but feel free to blame his lack of transparency of my if you want.
Btw, what would you think about him doing an AMA after the conference, after the results of the impact of Garza being there is known, and the amount the conference earned is more or less finalized so he can tell how much he made?
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:22:01
The financial impact in this case would ruin him and any future conferences, anyway. So, between taking a reputation hit and having to recover while being more careful about whom to sell sponsorships to, and completely failing and not having conferences while fighting legal battles for months or years, the choice is obvious I think. That sponsorship was a lot of money. Of it was just $3000, I'd agree, but if it's $30,000...
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:38:21
The money that was already spent? Should he pay it out of his own pocket?

You also need experience and skills to run a conference, and have similar goals to have it targeted towards regular users and not run it just for massive profit, as opposed to the many other conferences out there that are geared towards big bankers and wealthy types with $400 to $600 tickets.

For now the safest method is using a dedicated hardware device (like Trezor, or a cheap laptop running Armory or Electrum that never connects to the internet), or storing your keys on paper wallets (you can print them from biraddress.org, bitcoinpaperwallet.com, and soon with a Mycelium Entropy device). The easiest is probably to use a paper wallet, and use your Mycelium's Cold Storage option to top up your Mycelium wallet with spending cash. Eventually wallets like Mycelium and others will be safe enough to store all your coins on, once they implement support for ARM's TrustZone, but that won't be available at least until Spring.
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:49:33
Any wallet that followed BIP39 and BIP44 standard should work. Trezor, Wallet32, probably a few others. A lot of wallets aren't standard yet (Electrum, DarkWallet) and are just catching up, but eventually hopefully the same Mycelium seed will work on any wallet.

Actually the opposite. If I see a bitcoin spot price, my buying bitcoins will move it up, meaning the last few pieces of the purchase I buy will be higher than the spot price. Likewise, when a merchant sells a good priced at a spot price, when he goes to sell the bitcoins, it will push the price down, and he will get less than he was hoping for too.

To put that another way, to prevent the complete collapse of the system, the system has to be used. Yes.


That's not what a pyramid scheme means. This is in the similar way that, for example, for Uber to succeed as a company, the amount of Uber drivers needs to grow fast enough for it to be self-sufficient before investment money runs out. Or, really, any business that is self-funded, where it has to grow and get enough market share to become profitable, before the invested money runs out. In bitcoin that invested money is sort of self-invested through mining rewards. And, just like any other business, it has to either grow fast enough to become self-sufficient, or it will die off. So, again, not a pyramid scheme.


It's a good thing that 2014 had massive growth software development/app wise, and 2015 already has a bunch more new developments, apps, and hardware getting finished up.

Scammers and liars lie. That's what they do. An oath wouldn't have helped. I doubt it would have helped in a contract.
I'm sure the organizers have learned their lesson, but they are not the greedy scammers in this case. They are the victims who took money to try to do something good for the community, and are now stuck in a situation with no way out. I think canceling Garza's speaking slot and replacing it with just a Q&amp;A is the best they could have done.

What happens at conferences is businesses present their products, people with ideas come and pitch their ideas at booths, business owners discuss ways they can collaborate and exchange info, and then AFTER the conference is over for the day, people meet together for drinks in private, and actually plan and go over ideas for what they will build together. Typical conference goers probably miss that part, if they don't actually talk or build relationships during the conference. You can't build these relationships and plans just online. Well, you probably can, but it's not easy.

Proof of Reserves does prove that a company is not running fractionally. The point is not to make sure the company doesn't have too many outstanding liabilities where other people may have claims on your coins, it's to prove that the coins the company does have are actually real, so as to prevent inflation and subsequent price decreases that would happen should a company decide to issue and start trading with 650,000 coins it may not actually have (MtGox). So what proof of reserves does is protect all bitcoin users from fractional reserve inflation, and to a small part the users of a business they trust with their money, since they know the money they are trading for actually exists, regardless of who may have claims to it. It isn't supposed to protect against the business failing or getting hacked and losing people's money.

Look up ["Moral Hazard"]( and the results of said in 2008 financial crash. All thanks to insurance and many "investments."


It's not "libertarian bullshit" when the FDIC has in fact **ran out of money** after the 2008 crash and had to be bailed out. Whether its trillions of dollars, or billions, the question is whether there is enough in the FDIC reserves to cover whatever amount is needed should another scenario like the one in 2008 happened. The answer is, we don't know. So, unlike FDIC, at least self insured exchanges are known to be 100% covered, assuming their reserves are greater than their hot wallet ammounts.

Mycelium is not one of those others. We have intended to make our wallet as anonymous as possible, without any user input or say, for a long time now. The hope is that when everyone is anonymous and mixing by default in the background, without even knowing they are, things like address tracking, white/blacklists, and other regulatory shenanigans would be dead before they had a chance to be passed into legislation. We're just not as vocal or charismatic about it as Cody Wilson and Aamir, mostly because we want to have a normal wallet that all normal people will want to install (wink-wink), instead of a hacker wallet for buying drugs.

Since the MtGox fiasco, exchanges have improved their security and keep reserves to cover hot wallet losses. Same as FDIC (which is pooled insurance), but self-insured.
You can insure yourself through a company, where a bunch of people can pool their reserves and someone guestimates how much in reserves they need to cover losses (insurance, including FDIC, never keeps 100% reserve, so if too many users file a claim, the insurance won't have enough to cover everyone), OR you can self insure by keeping enough in reserves to cover any losses you might expect, such as by keeping the same amount as in your hot wallet in reserves, so if its stolen, you can cover 100% of it.
Self insurance is more expensive, since you are not sharing your risk with others, but it is much better, because you know your risk level much better than the insurance company could, are guaranteed to have the money if you need it, and keep the money as yours as long as you stay safe, instead of paying it to the insurance company, which creates a huge incentive to stay safe so you don't have to spend that money. When I used to work as a financial analyst and sold financial products, including insurance, I would always suggest that people only buy a little bit of life insurance while they don't have anything save up, and gradually reduce their coverage as their savings grew. No sense in paying someone else for $100k coverage if you have $100k in your IRA already.
As long as exchanges can prove that their self-insured reserve balance is above the amount that they have in their hot wallet, users should be safe to use those exchanges, and be covered in case of hacks.

Mycelium would, if that sponsor wasn't a known scammer at the time. And if it turned out that the sponsor was a scammer, Mycelium would not shut down their wallet and cause people to lose money (if conference shut down, people who paid for planes and hotels would be out of luck). I don't think Mycelium would ask the developers to skip a few paychecks so that money could be collected to return back to the scammer.

The part where the money he took and spent was not from scammers at the time it happened, as far as the organizers knew. The money was taken, and spent on the venue. It's gone. It didn't go into their pockets, it went to put on a conference for us. The conference organization is also a nonprofit, so they are not profiting from scammers.

Coinbase - normal users, and now exchange traders
BitPay - merchants and businesses
Should Bitcoin become a dominant world currency, Coinbase either won't be needed, since no one would exchange any more, or they will become the equivalent of today's bank, offering to securely store users' bitcoins. BitPay, on the other hand, will always be needed to receive and process merchant's bitcoins, generate invoices, and generate reports needed to do accounting and tax filing.
P.S. I have a special place in my heart for BitPay too :) Especially since they were the first to offer free services to charities and nonprofits, and helped out IMMENSELY during Bitcoin100's early days.

You can't refund sponsorships when you run conferences, because that money is spent instantly. Conferences typically go in debt paying for venues and other conference expenses, and hope to earn back the money through last minute ticket sales. So the only way to cut losses at this point is to cancel the venue, the conference, and still owe a ton to the venue for the huge cancelation fee.
I also doubt about selling last minute tickets. No doubt most of the people protesting this won't even be in Miami.

It's not Mycelium, it's ANY bitcoin wallet if your phone is rooted.
I would not make a large difference if we encrypt anything on a rooted phone. The reason we left the PIN unencrypted is because it would make the attack a little bit harder, but not by much. Plus all that the PIN does is allow the physical user of the phone to confirm that they want to spend. An attacker getting a copy of the PIN won't gain anything out of it unless they steal the phone too.
A rooted attacker app might instead replace our app (or any wallet app) by one that waits for the user to enter his pin and then grab the privkey right from memory as soon as it's detected - so, never store BTC on a rooted phone... no matter what app you use (...except for using mycelium+Trezor/Ledger/TEE/some other secure hardware)
And a six-digit numeric-only pin is also quite easy to bruteforce, so even if the attacker grabbed the encrypted privKey, it would probably take him less than a day to test all pins on it.
So, this doesn't apply to Mycelium, it applies to ALL bitcoin wallets on phones. Including Wallet32. Your best options are to not root the phone that you have bitcoin on, or use Mycelium with a Trezor, and soon Ledger and TEE.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:30:28

I think only the top sponsors got charged that much. Moe earns a small salary, as do other people who work for the conference. I would guess this venue costs $40k+. Other costs are electricity, probably up to $10k, internet, probably $2k, any kind of snacks, probably $4k, AV equipment, probably another $3k, printing and other con materials, another $2k, website and marketing, another $1k to $2k, and salaries for employees, probably $20k. Thats about $82k. I'm just guessing based on my prior experience doing financials for these types of conferences. People have no idea how ridiculously expensive and overpriced everything is usually.

I was once, yes. I've also done finances for other conferences and conventions too. You usually don't actually break even until the last few weeks, when people are buying last minute tickets, since many people aren't sure if they can make it until later. That is if you even break even, since often conferences overestimate the number of attendees, and end up in debt at the end. That means that a lot of the conference expenses, such as venue payments that are due before the conference, are paid for with money you borrow, or whatever money you have available, such as sponsorship money.


My guesstimate is that those hundreds of thousands is actually closer to less than one hundred thousand, and that the venue alone cost 40 to 60 thousand. This is just a guess. Could be more, since this is in a prime area of Miami Beach.


The conference I helped run has a lowest tier nonprofit status, which I suspect this one does too, and they are not allowed to earn enough to pay such salaries. FYI, when I did finances for one of Moe's previous ones, his salary for the 4+ months of work to put one together was way way less than $10k. Definitely not half a milmil. Not even a good white collar wage one.
Why were you banned btw? And is it worth fighting to get unbanned, or is keeping your post history private a benefit?

Assuming your bank is FDIC inured. ALSO, insurance reserves in FDIC ran out of funds in 2008, requiring an emergency bailout. If a bank crash greater than the one in 2008 happens, there may not be enough of a bailout to save 100% of lost funds. Insurance is not a panacea; it's only as good as the actuary's skill at guessing how much is needed in reserves. Eg, Lehman Brothers.

Move to Somalia!" so often that I actually did a whole lot of reading about Somalia's history, culture, economy, and current events, including looking into is as a place for possible investment (turns out it's a bad idea, precisely because it's not libertarian or anarchy).

With regards to FDIC, it's just regular insurance that banks are required to pay premiums on. So in the case of a claim, no one is really stolen from. Banks have already paid for the money in the insurance pot, which they get by charging their users fees, or using their money to invest.

Of course I know what insurance means.

If you mean bitcoin to altcoin, we would need to add support for altcoins first. I guess for now you can treat alts as cash, so, if you want to buy $200 worth of alt, you would meet, transfer whatever $200 worth of alt is worth at the time, and select Cash Received in the wallet. Advertising that you are trading for something other than cash may be difficult, but we plan to expand on that too.
Privacy(anonymity) is one of the main ones in LocalTrader. Otherwise, we are missing a whole lot still, like a good reputation system, and escrow (preferably third party arbitration like in OpenBazaar, instead of us holding coins in escrow)

There was a small bug where during an update your bitcoin balance information is wiped and needed to be resynced to show up again. None of your private keys would be wiped, the wallet just wouldn't see that you already had transactions on your old addresses, and assume no transactions = zero balance. If this ever happens again, go to Accounts tab, select your account, and in the menu select Rescan Account. That will force it to go through and check every one of your old addresses for transactions and balances again, updating it to the correct amounts.

That's not how a mortgage in a deflationary economy would be calculated. Mortgages used now, in the example that you described, specifically assume inflation. Long term loans in a deflation would have to take that deflation into account, and be done this way 
where the **value** of the payment is fixed, not the nominal amount. So your first payment would have to be much bigger, and your consecutive payments less and less. Note that the lender still gets the same interest earnings.
Also, people still need to eat, so will still buy pizza. Gyft claims the most popular sale item they sell through bitcoin is food.
Also, you are ignoring the wealth effect in deflation. People spend more when they thing they have more money and can afford it. As bitcoin prices go up, people spend more money on bitcoin businesses. As its price goes down, they hold onto the bitcoins tighter, fearing they are running out and not wanting to spend more bitcoins than they could if it starts going up again.
Finally, if you look at the history of those 4 periods (in the links you yourself provided), you'll notice that inflation was not the only cause of the ugliness, and mainly just exacerbated issues cause by other events (bank failures mostly). I could likewise argue that the issues of 2008 were caused by inflation, as well as the debt crises of US and other countries around the world.

Gambling is betting on completely random odds with the hopes that the randomness works in your favor.

Price matters in that lower prices make the market much more volatile, and don't allow to absorb higher sized transfers. If people just bought $3 coffees and sandwiches, low price would be fine, but anyone making a $10k purchase would shift the market.

Yes, your address changes with every transaction, making tracking coins that belong to you much more difficult. When your change goes to a new address, someone looking at a public blockchain won't know which coins went to whomever you are paying and which went to you.

Hi. Mycelium here. ARM processors already integrate something called TrustZone, but there are no drivers or API for it yet, so Android developers and phone manufacturers just leave it unused. There is a company called Rivetz.com that is developing APIs for it (they are almost done, and you can see a working demo on their website) which will allow you to store and sign private keys inside that secured hardware. Mycelium hopes to implement it soon after it comes out. When that becomes available, it will be as if you have a built-in Trezor for free (minus whatever fee they charge for the API plugin), where Mycelium will send a transaction through an encrypted secure channel to the hardware, which runs on a totally separate hardware from the Android OS and is completely invisible and inaccessible to it, the hardware will pop up with its own display over your Android screen and ask you to verify the transaction using a keyboard that can't be seen or spoofed by the OS, and when you confirm it, sign it and send it back for Mycelium wallet to broadcast.

Actually the trolls were attracted to here WAY before that, because they viewed bitcoin as a Ponzi, tulip mania, pyramid scam, beanie babies, and worthless internet monopoly money, and took it upon themselves to crusade and save the world from falling for this scam. The fact that almost none of them understood what bitcoin is or how it worked, and kept repeating the same misconceptions (that many of them still repeat to this day) didn't help.

He may be the real Dread Pirate Roberts, but he is likely not the first one. The reason that moniker is used is because in the movie Princess Bride, there is a Dread Pirate Roberts who seems to live and plunder for a very long time, and it is revealed that the pirate, who's real name is different, just passes that name onto his heir after retiring. In SR, there too seem to have been a few Dread Pirate Roberts, based on the change in writing style of the admin and operation of the business over the years.

The government wasn't a guarantor originally. In the real world case it was Lehman Brothers, which used the completely wrong AAA rating to undercharge for the risk involved in insuring these bonds. You essentially had a situation where the bonds had a return of, say, 7%, but it cost 3% to insure them against all loss, which in itself should have been a big warning flag, since nothing should be completely free (or risk free). Only after Lehman failed and that mistake was realized did the government step in and set a Too Big to Fail precedent.

Oh, yeah, that would be cool, but that's not really regulation. Regulation would be demanding that companies do that, but even that had issues, since regulations can't keep up with innovation.

We would actually have to hire Aamir to do that for us, since none of us have any experience with it. For now it's easier to get CoinJoin working. CoinJoin also has a huge added benefit of protecting people who aren't even using CoinJoin. If some large percentage of the bitcoin network uses CoinJoin (even 20%), there's no way to tell if a transaction by someone who doesn't use a CoinJoin wallet is mixed or not, as they can also claim that their transaction was CoinJoined, and they don't know who the inputs were.

They are correlated, but people often assume they are correlated in the wrong direction. Rising(Lowering) price attracts miners, and that in turn increases(lowers) difficulty.

Updates to LocalTrader are happening, but are progressing very slowly due to a lot of other important features that need to be implemented. Our main issue is that we do not want to be an escrow party to any trades, since that exposes us to liability, so that makes it more difficult for people to trade using more risky online services for the cash side (like bank transfers). We need to create buyer accounts that can also build up a reputation over time.
All of the users private keys, and thus bitcoins, only exist on their phones. They never go through our systems. When traders complete a trade, the coins are sent directly from one phone to the other.
I don't really understand your last paragraph question...
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:06:12
That the cost per transaction will keep declining with growing user adoption (transaction value), relying less and less on mining subsidy. That $15 per transaction is actually just during the bootstrap phase, and that will keep decreasing to ~$0.03 as time goes on. That cost being $15 only assumes inflation and ignores countering price growth from adoption, so if inflation is at 10% and growth from adoption is 10%, the nominal price is still $0.03, and the $15 is not the actual cost but "opportunity cost" from not realizing gains from that growth.
Basically that claiming it costs $15 to make a bitcoin transaction is not exactly true.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:13:21

Guys, if you really think Josh is a problem, and don't want him to be a sponsor at this conference, instead of attacking the conference to try to get Moe to do something he likely can't - break a very expensive contract based on just your words - go after Josh himself and get him indicted, which would make him an actual legally recognized scammer, and make the contract possible to drop legally. All you are doing is whining about someone you don't like on the internet being an alleged scammer (even if there is plenty of evidence). In the Real World™ you don't just break contracts worth tens of thousands just because a bunch of internet commenters are pissed at you. So either turn this wrath at the actual scammer, help bring him to justice, and help Moe get out of this legally, or at least realize that your personal accusations and whining can't amount to squat in regards to getting this issue resolved.
P.S. To whoever keeps so obviously brigading my posts regardless of the content, keep going. I have quite a massively positive reputation on this thread, so I doubt you'll make much of a dent in it, but I'm curious to see you try.

You're forgetting the risk factor here. People who want to have stability and available money (liquidity) will stay in "shares." Those who want more risk will trade "shares" for stocks that appreciate or give dividends. This will not happen suddenly, as implied, but will keep happening as "shares" keep getting adopted, constantly staying in equilibrium where as "share" risk and return goes up, it gets adopted more, and as it goes down, it gets traded for stocks.


Currency IS the network. Instead of looking at this from **within** the currency you are currently operating in (e.g. what is the risk and advantage of me using dollars while I live in a dollar-based economy), look at it from a global currency perspective. If I an using bolivar currency, on a bolivar currency network, I am much better off switching to dollar currency on a dollar network, because of bolivar currency's inherent flaw. Bolivar network is fine, but its currency sucks. Conversely, if I am using currency Aruban florin on an Aruban florin network, the currency part is perfectly fine, but the network, although perfectly functional, is not as valuable as the dollar network, so depending on my situation, I may stay in Aruban florin, or switch to the dollar network and currency. And as Venezuelan bolivar, or Aruban florin currency or network declines in value, by comparison the dollar currency and network increases in value. So, to a dollar user in a dollar economy, your dollar value and network are perfectly stable, while to someone looking from the bolivar or florin network, the dollar network is greatly increasing in value. Moreso, if more and more people are escaping from their own currency network into the dollar one. (sorry for wordiness).

Because I know how conferences are run. Money spent on venues and other expenses, exceeds money that is brought in through ticket sales until the last minute tickets are bought. People don't buy conference tickets way ahead of time en masse, so conference organizers almost always prepay for the conference, usually with loans, unless they are rich enough to pay for them out of pocket. And Moe is not rich. I also know it was spent.


This event organizer is a nonprofit entity. And as I mentioned, any profits they earn, if any, they will earn in these last few weeks and from ticket sales at the door. They may not even break even.


Sponsorships here were $10k to $30k. If Garza paid the $30k amount, there is no way they can return it, considering it wouldn't even cover the cost of the venue, and was already spent on it. Even if it's $10k I doubt they have enough.


They want to do this, but they can't. They have put on a lot of really good conferences, and I'm sure they want to keep putting them on without having their reputation ruined, but they don't have the money to pay back, and are stuck under contract. They are screwed.

It may be that spending wallets (geared towards privacy) and merchant wallets (geared towards linking transactions to customers) are use cases that are too different to implement in the same wallet.

They have to because the $30k sponsorship was paid for, there is a contract for it, and them being a nonprofit there is no way they can just come up with that money to pay it back, pr at lawyer fees to defend that kind of money. They can choose to cancel the whole conference, but the ones they run are usually really good, and it would be way worse to do that than to let some scammer get a Q&amp;A session.

Add that mining is competitive, and competition drives profits to zero, and miners will likely get to keep very little of the bitcoins they end up earning from fees.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:48:57
That may not be easy or possible. The only way to know that you received money is to ping your address on the blockchain. Mycelium has no idea who has what addresses, so has no way of notifying users when they receive payments. The only way to do this would be for Mycelium wallet to run in the background, ping our servers every few seconds, and let you know if something changed. That means your phone will be using CPU resources and data even while your wallet is closed, and our servers will get flooded with balance requests.
Since we plan to add failover support for SPV style connection, where the Wallet will connect directly to nodes if it can't reach us, we may be able to have them ping random bitcoin nodes for balances to distribute the load, but problem with that is it reduces privacy quite a bit, since a single wallet pinging for a bunch of addresses lets the node know that those addresses are likely associated with each other. Our system doesn't track that at all.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:14:57
What do you expect the conference organizers to do? The money they were given for sponsorship was spent before they knew this guy was a scammer, and he has a contract. Are you going to pay them so they can return the sponsor's money and ask him not to come?

Don't know about mastering bitcoin book. Haven't read it.
Bitcoin mining pools run a full node. Typically an optimized version of it that allows many connections, uses its own more efficient database, and only runs the Bitcoin Core bitcoind client on the side to download and broadcast blocks and transactions. Miners just have mining hardware, and a mining software interface, which connects to the mining pool, requests work (such as "Search for a solution to X using variables N through M), and crunches the numbers. Miners actually don't even know what transactions or block data they are searching for until the pool puts the block together.  If it doesn't find anything, it requests more work (this time is given O through P, and so on, to make sure miners aren't searching the same keyspace, and are looking for a solution that fits the transactions the pool is aware of). If it finds something, it submits that number to the pool, which then uses it to compile the block, check it, and broadcast it. You can run a miner off of a RaspberryPI with very little storage space and processing power, since mining hardware and pool servers do all the heavy processing work, and the computer that the miner is connected to just handles very light communications.  
So, mining pools, exchanges, and some businesses will pretty much always have to run a node, but users and miners only need small light software. Users can compare the data they get from nodes to verify that they aren't being lied to, and switch easily if they are, and miners can make sure mining pools aren't stealing from them, or posing a risk to the network, and switch to another pool if they suspect they are. All that nodes can do is offer true information about balances and be willing to broadcast transactions, or lose trust to other nodes, who are probably earning money from offering mining pool or business services. There is risk of collusion, but for now everyone understands that colluding will likely hurt trust and break the colluder's business.
BTW, this is why there are sometimes worries about number of nodes declining, and incentives being offered to run one. Unlike mining, you don't earn anything by running a node, other than instant access to blockchain data, which is only something businesses that earn money other ways may need.

Are you, like, a retarded person or something? My hypothesis is that hyperinflation can be caused by a number of factors that force a government to print out more money, with socialist overspending leading to massive government debt being one of them. So its completely valid.
Are you going to tell me that if there are multiple things that can cause an outcome (e.g. both knives and bullets cause wounds), that means that one of them does NOT cause that outcome? (e.g. bullets don't actually wound bodies, and socialist spending does not actually wound government?) What the hell kind of logic is that?

So when dollars cost you too much, you use euros?

By having more being stuffed into the capacity than the capacity can fit. So, if a block has 1mb limit, then 1mb and above constantly trying to be forced into a block would make them at full or over capacity, as in "100%+".

I'm a bit weirded out by the results. It's as if the wallets were ranked competent randomly. Not sure how Mycelium ended up at the bottom, considering it's one of the few that natively supports Tor, and other higher ranked ones have issues with SPV bloom filters.

You've been reading a bit too much.
By the way, how would an authority address legitimate concerns in a distributed P2P system? Force a change in the Bitcoin core to allow for charge backs and make bitcoin wallets force people to provide their IDs before they start to work? Maybe force a change in the mining algorithm so that the authority can manage the supply of bitcoins to keep its value more stable?

That probably no, but most users don't use priority, as that goes up to $0.20 a transaction when things get flooded (now that it's calm again, it's at $0.06). Generally users - especially newbies - expect Bitcoin to have "low fees" and select ¢1 to ¢3 fees, being surprised when their transactions randomly get stuck for hours.
Basically, when backlogs happen, even supposedly calculated fees can get unpredictable.

Correction, he TOOK money from someone no one knew was a scammer, and spent that money on the conference before he found out it was a scammer. He's not making money from the scammer, and he got swindled info this too. He doesn't have any options now that the money is spent, and the scammer has a contract with him.
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:55:40
Because I don't need a node to use Bitcoin and can use SPV? Because I can verify pretty much everything I need just by querying a dozen nodes to verify them against reach other? Because the idea that bigger blocks will cause centralization completely forgets about pruning, which has been discussed as the scaling option since the very beginning?
If blocks remain the same size, and as a result fees go up to even $20, do you think people will pay $20 to establish channels with everyone they send money to? Or pay it once to a large node that they can do business through with anyone? That would effectively be like using Coinbase because it's cheaper. How is that not centralization? Or am I missing something?

We had constant delays due to the hardware in this thing being so cutting-edge. The circuit board, display, and battery are all flexible and are paper-thin. So, when a manufacturer of some component goes out of business, which is common in cutting edge hardware, we'd lose two months looking for a replacement and redesigning the rest of the hardware to fit. We were expecting to be able to start selling them this Spring, but we found that if you flex it too much, gold leads connecting the CPU can cross and short, so we had to redesign the layout a bit again, meaning more time to redesign, create test units, and more testing. At this point we're hoping for end of year release.
@_date: 2016-03-05 07:17:23
From our end it looks as if we're basically hitting a wall once in a while, where blocks are full, then for some time transaction rate calms down a bit, then another flood of transactions comes it and overwhelms the system again, forcing us to wait for the flood to clear through again. I can't see things getting any better from this, unless users start abandoning bitcoin a bit.


Yeah, quite a few. Weve had a flood of support requests about stuck transactions, and having to wait for almost an hour for a confirmation is pretty common.
P.S. It's nice to see things have calmed down a bit right now. Hope it stays like this for at least two more months.

They're are no shops anywhere in the area that accept gold. Gold just isn't a currency at this point. And that's what worries me about bitcoin; that it will become like gold instead of like actual money.

Soft forks still need a majority to switch just not "all miners, all nodes, and all wallets" as you claimed, which IS needed for a hard fork.
If 55 of miners switch to SW, those who did not could mine an invalid block, but it would be rejected by the 55 majority. Then when the majority creates the longer chain of properly validated blocks, and the 45 minority that didn't upgrade would reorganize and choose the correct longer chain. They won't even have to do anything, and only risk losing money only on invalid blocks.
If this was a hard fork scenario, the 45 minority that didn't upgrade would not ever choose the longest block chain, because they would always see anything but their own chain as invalid. For instance, if the change was to a 2mb block, both groups would mine blocks they both accept, until a &gt;1mb block is mined, as which point the 45 minority that didn't upgrade it would reject that block and the chain that's built on top of it, regardless of how long it gets.

You shouldn't be asking why people aren't running nodes, you should be asking why are they. What motivates them to. Even a small node install a few years ago was a PITA to install and maintain, for no real benefit other than "contribute to the network" and **maybe** "keep my own coins secure." If you want more nodes, I think you should focus on incentives for running nodes (like pay to relay or something), not just making them easier to run (which, even at the current size, that ship has long sailed).

The white paper talks about volume of transactions and thus the sum of all fees increasing, not volume of transactions being limited and individual fees going up. Basically, instead of going from 1000 transactions * 0.1mBTC fees to 10,000 transactions * 0.1mBTC fees, and NOT to same 1000 transactions * 1mBTC fees. If we want to follow the white paper, there should be no block limits at all, and people who consented to only that are getting screwed by what is essentially a "temporary" patch to prevent spam while Bitcoin is worthless.

For profit, of course. Developers tend to be more motivated it they get paid, and companies more driven and innovative.
Don't forget that all of Bitcoin is basically built on a self-correcting and self-sustaining profit motive (mining rewards, more profitable to mine than attack, etc.)


Fortunately Bitcoin itself is decentralized, and is an anarchy consensus system, so even if some companies decide to make centralized options, they can't force the rest of us to follow and use their systems.

Good to hear about a tee version. Mycelium should have that available really soon too (already works, just needs a better UI).
Mycelium only uses servers to get address balance information and to broadcast transactions. Mycelium servers index all addresses and all balances, allowing Mycelium wallets to instantly get a balance from any address, which is what it uses to be able to spend instantly from paper wallets and hardware wallets like Trezor. And all keys are stored on "this device only." It's not possible  to back them up without rooting your phone.

Hearts and minds of these people determines whether bitcoin will be bought, used, and invested in. Professional investors look at this to determine whether to invest their millions, or divest. They do the same thing in the rest of the stock market, by looking at market sentiment.

Don't forget that every POS bitcoin transaction requires TWO communications, first to tell the wallet which address to send bitcoins to, and second for the wallet to send the signed bitcoin transaction. This is different from credit card transactions in that with credit cards, there is one communication to give the POS full and complete access to the funds in the credit card account, after which the merchant can request to withdraw however much they need. In bitcoin terms, this is the equivalent of sending your private key to the POS terminal, and trusting the merchant to withdraw only the amount they should get.

Remember what happened with MtGox, where USD was impossible to take out while bitcoin was easy to move. People sold USD for BTC just to get their money out, causing the price of BTC to skyrocket, and the value of MtGox USD to plummet. It became it's own mini speculative attack, where the more people tried to get money out, the more they convinced others to dump USD and buy BTC.
Now imagine what would happen in a BTC and BTU scenario. Say BTU creates a fork once they have a 75% hash rate. BTU has short confirmation times, BTC has ones four times longer. BTC also has a much bigger transaction backlog. If you try to pull your money out as BTU, you'll get it fairly quickly, but if you want to get it out as BTC, you have to wait a while. People start selling BTC for BTU just to get their money out. BTC price drops, BTU price goes up. A speculative attack has begun. People sell their BTC because BTU is growing, causing the price of one vs the other to rise faster. People still holding BTC realize their money value is collapsing, so they desperately try to send it to the exchange, filling up the transaction backlog even more, making it even more impossible for BTC holders to get their money out, forcing even more of them to convert to BTU to get their money, in turn making the price rise even more.

But in this case 5 out of 6 miners pulled the bullet out of their gun. It's in the remaining miner's self interest to do the same, but they can continue to accept SegWit mined blocks is they want to.

There's unfortunately too much data to try to send through QR codes, and not enough demand for something like that, since it would be inconvenient for most users. More professional services like multisig accounts, or hardware devices like Ledger or Trezor are probably a better option. We also support Ledger TEE (Ledger Trustlet on Google Play store) which basically runs a computer like you describe, but all inside your own phone, so you get all that security without even needing a separate device. It only gets invoked when the wallet connects to it via an encrypted channel asking to sign something, and the private keys never leave that separate hardware device.

@_date: 2016-01-24 17:44:51


No they don't. SegWit is a soft fork. Old wallets will still work. Users will just have to pay normal (instead if discounted) fees, and wait for a block to see if they're transaction happened. I'm fairly certain all the top wallets will implement it too.

Sorry if this sounds like a sore looser, but honestly the judging in that hackathon was just fucked. Teams were given only 2 minutes to present and 1 minute for judges' questions, the questions were sometimes a bit stupid and rarely technical, and no one cared about actual code. I probably could have placed or even won just by spending the day with nothing more than MS Paint and HTML links.
Hell, second place winner looked like just a microtransaction channel that, instead of being an actual bitcoin one, was just a plugin into Coinbase's API running in a browser. A lot of those projects didn't get much further past "this is our concept, and what we hope to some day have, but here's a website with pictures." Possibly because they simply couldn't present much more than that in 2 minutes. Some even resorted to PowerPoint slides.
As opposed to an actual functional near-complete app the team I was rooting for presented and demonstrated live right on the phone. A bunch of people later approached those team members to tell them they think they were robbed. At least the project is something that a friend and I have wanted to build since this past Summer, planning to find devs, raise money, and have me plow my own money into it. Unfortunately, a personal tragedy (death of a friend) totally ruined me for 2 months, so the project was initially totally abandoned. So even if the team didn't win first place, at least the app is now almost done and my idea is almost a reality.

Bcash is just a copy of bcoin (pre-segwit). It's not the basics like addresses and signatures that's the problem, it's getting the transaction and then the SegWit data on top of it. Remember, SegWit splits tx information into two pieces, so while for bcash all you have to do copy bcoin code and look at new nodes, for SegWit you have to track extra data on top, while using the same p2sh addresses.
Besides, bcash isn't fully supported yet either. You can't send it, all you can do is convert it to bcoin.

Hiding a needle in a stack of hay is much easier than hiding it in a few small stacks that the needle has no choice to pass through. Bitcoin and anonymity works when everyone is using it together.

It can't create a new altcoin. Bitcoin isn't Etherium. With a two week difficulty adjustment tarkeg, the losing fork will die due to probably a month or more of difficulty adjustment and extremely long confirmation times. So consensus is almost assured.
But that's not what this is about. The issue is that any change to the protocol that is not backwards compatible is considered an altcoin. Which is, again, ridiculously stupid. It's like claiming the internet died because we abandoned BNC connectors and went with RJ45 or something.

You say there's no urgency. Will there be urgency in two years? Because the way hard forks work is if we were to decide to have a fork today, it would take a few months to settle on the details of the change, and then the fork will get scheduled to automatically switch on at least 1.5 years from then, when everyone is sure to have updated their code to support the change. And if it is suddenly urgent two years from now while we're still dicking around with this bullshit, we will either have two years of operating under urgent stress, or have to rush this and fuck it up in the process.
Forks aren't just something that gets implemented as soon as we agree on it.

That sounds like regulations and maybe hyper inflation (like what is happening in  Venezuela, which like you, still believes you can't run out of what it issues itself)


I have X number of dollars.  I add 1 dollar and have X+1 number of dollars. Savings. I don't see the problem. Or maybe fiat money is the problem.


I have. Had it in undergrad, grad, and even as a job at one point. Maybe you mean government accounting? 


Neoliberal economics is also called "economics." What you are referring to is government economic policies. Judging by "the world we live in," government economic policy is terrible, as you can't go against economics (neoliberal even) without some major consequences.


Stagnant wages and unemployment are only in countries with heavy regulation and weak property protections, where companies and entrepreneurs (those damn neoliberals) refuse to invest in, or move their businesses out of. Wages are booming in countries that are abandoning those regulations and adopting more neoliberal policies (China, Switzerland,  Singapore, Hong Kong,  Dubai, even Iceland)
High personal debt seems to only happen in places with inflationary fiat currencies and government managed low interest rates. So again the opposite of neoliberal policies.
And debt crisis? How much opposite of neoliberal can you get? You can't have a debt crisis with a balanced budget that neoliberlism advocates for.


Zimbabwe and Venezuela agree with you.


I wouldn't exactly call the politicians giving away the country's factories and resources to political friends, who had no idea how to run those or cares after taking all the money out of them, "neoliberal policies." Look at Poland instead. It went full Neoliberal after USSR in the proper way, by privatizing everything going and selling it to foreign businesses, instead of corrupt political buddies. You don't hear many problems from Poland, despite it being part of Eastern Europe,  do you? And there's also those pesky "neoliberal experiments" like Hong Congress, Shanghai,  Dubai, and every other economic free trade zone to throw a wrench into your claim.

@_date: 2016-12-02 15:47:19
Actually he did. That was the only way to design that system at the time, and he did intend it to be digital cash, meaning cheap and fast (semi-fast) settlement. He even described it as "digital cash," not "digital gold," and described ways it could scale to handle thousands of transactions a second (he was somewhat wrong in his estimates, but that was the intent). FYI, these are the conclusions and estimates that have come out of the discussions and testing we have done when he was still around  Note the absence of "settlement layer" or "wealth storage."
I'm guessing you, like a lot of people who make claims like yours, are fairly new to this bitcoin thing, missed all the old discussions we had, and are just sticking your own bias into a situation you don't know the history of.

The problem with these types of charts is that price graphs are fractals. Zoom in and you'll find plenty of times where it can fit on a small scale ($30, $250, and $1,200 bubbles). Zoom out and you can fit it to the all time graph. So it doesn't really help. It also doesn't really predict anything.

Optimal transaction fees change. Since there's 10 minutes between blocks, each person sending after you will likely pay a slightly higher fee, making your adequate fee inadequate. And the longer it takes between your transaction and the block confirmation, the worse off you'll be.

No, fiat is a unit of account. And that's the problem with the real joke here, sir, which is your "macro accounting 101." According to jokers who follow that bullshit, they can create wealth by simply printing more money. And then in the same breath claim that money isn't wealth.

He's differentiating between inflationary currency and deflationary currency. Keyword here is currency. Intent is the economics of inflation vs deflation. This is an economic discussion, not a use case. You think in that description he meant to say it should be literally used like gold? (I'm the imbecile here???)


That's not the intent of gold. And if this keeps going, then yes, the transaction fee you will pay for a bitcoin transaction will be the same as the fee you will pay to send your gold instantly (with insurance to back the send claim) and securely.


Not if you know what you're doing. Or are working on a second layer anonymity protocol (like we are).


Yes. Have you?


Yes, of course. If everyone just dumps it every time they get it, its value will go to zero. If someone sits on it, even for a second, the collective amount being sat on for that second removes the supply from the market and gives it value (why bitcoin can still be valuable even if it's only used as a transaction mechanism). But if everyone sits on their gold and doesn't trade it, then how do you know what the price is? Let's pretend everyone decided to sit on their bitcoin right now. No trading. How do you believe its price will go up from $750?
Sorry if what I'm saying is so complicated you have trouble understanding it, and it seems as if I'm not making sence. Try thinking about it first. It helps.

Encryption of stored data on the phone isn't really the issue. If there was an attack, it would be through software that scans for keys in memory. So as soon as you tried to spend, the key would get decrypted, loaded into memory, and stolen. So encrypting the file is not much more than a bandaid. If you want to be secure, either use a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor, Keepkey), or get a Samsung phone version 6 or higher (or Note version 4 or higher), and get a Ledger Trustlet app. That will allow you to use secure hardware storage right on your phone, as if your phone had a built-in hardware wallet.
We are exploring options of keeping things encrypted and secured on the new wallet though.

From an economics point of view. Specifically to describe its deflationary nature. Not from a use case point of view. It has always been assumed (by him and us at the time) that bitcoin will be a replacement for money (digital cash), not as a long term store of value or a settlement layer. That idea only came much much later, within the last two years, when scalability issues were brought up.


Right, but that applies to actual gold, diamonds, and many other things as well. Those things already exist, and don't really need a replacement.


He was one of the authors of the wiki, and back then was one of the core devs (he wrote the library most people are using in their mobile wallets). But even if he wrote the text himself, he didn't come up with those ideas, or do all the tests, on his own. Back then, believe it or not, Bitcoin was actually a team effort with everyone having the same goals. Who handled putting our discussions into text wasn't an issue.


If you've been around since 2010, I'm a bit surprised you have always considered it to be a store of value and not cash, since the intent has always been to replace banks, not to have a safe alternative for storing wealth. If you haven't, I'm curious when did you change your mind and why?
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:02:58
Yeah, no. Bitcoin can't be destroyed from the inside by ignorants either. It's a decentralized system, so if someone on the inside changes something that causes harm, people will just use a branch that doesn't suffer from that issue. Even if there is a worst case scenario of a hard fork change that ends up completely breaking bitcoin, the fork will just be reversed, and at most we would lose a few days of use. Sure, the price will tank temporarily (like it did the last time we had a fork that broke things), but it won't kill bitcoin.
There is only one thing that **can** kill bitcoin: an alternative system that is as good, or better, than bitcoin itself. Luckily bitcoin has a massive head start and strong network effects to keep it safe from the altcoin competitors, but if one of them provides a better alternative long enough, or if someone forks bitcoin where all your bitcoins are still spendable on the new chain that is better in some way, then and only then the old bitcoin will die.

Ethereum has a fast block difficulty change. Bitcoin's is two weeks. Ethereum forks were done rather quickly. Normally (and the way actually proposed) bitcoin forks involve proposed changes, then implemented code that stays dormant for months to a year until a certain date in the future AND a certain minimum percent signaled support for a change, and the code only activates in the background automatically after both conditions are met (future time reached and minimum % support reached). Because of both of these, should a bitcoin fork happen, even with as low as  75% support, you will have two forks, one which has 13 minute confirmation time and a 2.6 week difficulty change, and one that has 40 minute confirmation time, and an 8+ week difficulty change.
What this means for the losing fork (which couldn't happen with ETH) is longer confirmation times in general, and likely even longer confirmation times for individual users due to an overflooded mem pool, and worse, miners getting 1/4th of the mining revenue they would otherwise be able to get on the winning chain, for as long as two months. Now, do you believe that people will use the chain that takes much longer to confirm, and due to a transaction backlog is more expensive to use, AND that miners will be willing to lose 75% of their revenue (since they're mining blocks only 1/4th as often) for as long as two months without switching to the winning chain?

If you mean cash, one of the big problems is when you earn $3 a day, change is really important. It's common to have to wait for an hour or more until someone else buys something, just so you can get change. Bitcoin would solve that one big hurdle. Cash also limits transactions to only the third world region where the people live, and banks aren't too happy to support grey economies, so that's another place where Bitcoin would help.

Is that why the white paper says "Bitcoin: a digital gold?" Because we already have gold. You can buy it, stash it away, and hold it. What we need is a transaction mechanism that can't be tracked or frozen. No gold.

@_date: 2016-12-21 15:27:31
You don't need to be a creditor to beat saver. Why are you stuck on this idea? We have people with millions in savings in bitcoin. Whom is that bitcoin owed to, hmm? Nobody.


You must be using a specialized definition of "asset," since reducing the budget deficit does not make the private company's factories, property, stocks, or intercompany short term debt disappead. It doesn't even make their cash holdings dissappear. 


There's a recession in Venezuela, Argentina, Ukraine, and Russia. All with huge inflation problems. Deflation isn't what causes recessions, as they happen under inflation too. As for Bill Clinton, the recession at the end of his presidency had everything to do with the internet bubble popping, and nothing with budget surpluses.


Yes, it can. You assume people in the private sector are somehow dumber than people in government, but they're not. Private sector can evaluate the risk of borrowing and borrow only at rates, amounts, or short enough periods, not to end up in any debt crisis. Interest rates, and even Deflation, can be accounted for in the market as long as it's predictable.


And here you assume that since government can issue debt, someone will always be willing to buy it up. Explain Venezuela or Zimbabwe? Both are in trouble specifically because of debt.
Some global economic information for you to open up your narrow horizons:


The reason the dollar is up is because China has been crashing their currency on purpose to keep exports high, and the Euro is crashing due to high government debt. People are fleeing their wealth to foreign "safe" assets, one of which is the dollar. It's also why stocks are up, despite all indicators showing we're in another stock bubble.


QE was absorbed by foreign investment and stocks, with something like 90%+ of stock market growth since 2008 being simply QE cash dumped into it. As for oil, government debt is again the culprit. Saudi Arabia is a socialist country that follows old Soviet style 5 year plans. They set up a plan with expectations of oil being near $100 a barrel, and started carrying those plans out. But with shale oil and other new discoveries the price of oil started to decline. Saudi Arabian government already has debt and obligations for that 5 year plan, so they had no choice but to pump and sell more oil to pay that off. That in turn flooded the market with oil, making it cheaper, which required them to pump and sell even more. Saudi Arabia was the one responsible for crashing the oil prices (and inadvertently crashing Russia's and Venezuela's economies) due to government debt.
So my thinking isn't wrong, I'm just aware of what else is going on beyond macro economic 101 guesswork.


Money is an arbitrary unit, but it's not simply a measure of debt. Bitcoin and gold coins aren't units of debt. To get into semantics, currency or fiat is debt backed, money is a realso asset. But even with colloquial definitions of money, Bitcoin demonstrated it's not merely measuring debt.


Countries are indebted thanks to your Keynesian economic policies, not neoliberal. And they are told they must sell off their assets because no one is wiling to lend to them any more, not because of neoliberalism. Despite your claims, all those situations are examples that governments DO have limitations on borrowing, despite them being the sole issuer of the monetary unit.
and austerity doesn't drive down wages. Not any more than the result of useless government workers flooding the market and competing with private sector workers. But that's jnfortunately inevitable, since there's no one left to keep giving get the country money to keep their debt based economy going. That will happen everywhere where government debt has been the main economic driver.


Wow, you even got that wrong. Places with much lower economies (third world, and even poor neighborhoods) have way higher rates of reproduction than places with more wealth. Reproduction rates in Japan and much of Europe are near zero, while they're really high in Africa and parts of Asia.


This isn't an argument. You'll have to explain what exactly causes the labor force to shrink.
I can, however, claim that Keynesianism is literally economic suicide, because it builds up an whole economy on debt under the false assumption that governments can borrow indefinitely, making it look like things are great while living off the proverbial credit card, and then when the country runs out of people to borrow from (runs out of other people's money) their economy comes crashing down to just the real assets that it has, often losing as much as 90% of its wealth (which was mostly on paper) in the process. Seriously, how can you people be ignoring Venezuela, and Russia, Argentina, Ukraine, Zimbabwe and others? 


This formula is basically Real Wealth transfered to another person who through labor adds a bit of his own wealth. That Credit is useless if it's rapidly inflating fiat paper.


Actually in neoliberalism the worker gets real wealth, as does the creditor, while in your system the worker gets rapidly declining in value paper, while the creditor simply prints more of it while not contributing or adding real wealth to the economy. Your type of economics literally syphons wealth from everyone else for the benefit of the creditor class.

Maybe that's how you know that someone contributed to bitcoin nowadays.

You can't run out of paper and ink (unless you run out of money to pay for that paper and ink, like Venezuela did), but you can run out of the actual value. Just issuing money doesn't actually create any money. All you're doing is diluting everyone's wealth to take some for yourself. Eventually you just won't have any more wealth to dilute (like what happened in Venezuela).


No, neoliberalism tells countries that borrowing, from anyone, is terrible, and that countries should run balanced budgets. But countries don't listen, think debt isn't a problem, and like you, believe that they can't run out of something they issue themselves.

You have your 12 word seed, which is X
First wallet addresses are X+A+1, X+A+2, X+A+3, X+A+n... and so on
Second wallet addresses are X+B+1, X+B+2, X+B+3, X+B+n... and so on
That one seed can restore all your wallets and all their addresses. Deterministic is the part that lets you create multiple addresses per wallet. Hirearchical is the part that lets you create multiple wallets, still all from the same seed. Thus Hirearchical Deterministic.

It's closer to three years out. It will take at least a year for it to be settled and coded, maybe another 6 month to a year for the plans on how it will be rolled out to be made, and then at least a year to 2.5 years for all the infrastructure to actually be built. It needs both lightning nodes AND all the wallets to add support to it, as well as for users to start migrating their money into LN nodes.
Look at SegWit rollout, which came out in August, to give you an idea. There's still barely any wallets and services that support it.

Servers are sometimes lagging and appear offline, as they run into another batch of spam transactions that they get bogged down trying to process. We are working on separating the bitcoin processing and LT tasks so this won't be a problem in the future, but in the mean time you'll just have to wait for a period of time when things are calm, before the next flood comes in.

Don't forget that reorganization doesn't throw away transactions, it just offloads them back into the mempool and tries to include **whichever ones were missing** in the other fork. The other fork should have had most of them already as well, since both forks hear the same transaction broadcasts. So I think you are blowing this concern way out of proportion. Yes, long forks are a problem, but only if we don't know why they are happening, or if they are happening due to a bug that was unforseen and must be fixed. Here, the fork is happening because some miners and services have slacked off and refused to upgrade. We all know that they are bad miners, and they are on a bad fork. There is no question as to whom to trust (the good fork), and what to do (avoid bad miners and services).

Hi guys. Mycelium here. We have three nodes, spread around different parts of the world. Due to the current transaction spam flood some of them sometimes get bogged down while they are trying to process and verify all those transactions. Sometimes they get so overworked that the connection times out.
When you start the app, you get connected to a random server. You can check which one on Android but going to About &gt; Connection Logs at the bottom. Try connecting to a different one by backing out of and restarting the app.
In the mean time we are working on optimizing how we proceed transactions, separating the tasks of running the node, updating wallets, and running LocalTrader, and will be putting SPV functionality at the top of our list of priorities.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:07:04
We have three levels of fees right now, 0.01mBTC, 0.1mBTC and 0.2mBTC. When we switch to custom ones, we will have four levels to choose from, and the fees will be calculated based on what it will actually take to get the transaction confirmed. No reason to pay miners 1mBTC when you can actually look on the network and tell that 0.5mBTC will definitely get your transaction into the next block. Unless you want to donate to miners?
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:28:07
We updated out servers this morning to communicate between each other better. Transactions would disappear because some nodes would receive it from the network and others won't, so it would appear and disappear based on which random node you connected to. Now all nodes should theoretically see all transactions. Or they will once they are allowed some time to synchronize.

Why would I use a dead chain? Just means wallet services that do f'ed up and will lose customers, which is good, because we don't want f'ed up wallet services.
Also, when a fork reorganizes, transactions on the bad fork don't disappear. If someone sent me a transaction on a dead chain, which for some reason didn't also confirm on the good chain that the wallet I use is on, all that would happen is that this transaction, along with all other others on that chain, will go back into the mempool, still show up but as unconfirmed, and will get confirmed in the next block. This isn't the first time Bitcoin had forks. They happen all the time.
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:31:33
The fees won't be preset. They change based on what's going on with the network, so if something like this happens again (which we actually got a chance to test in beta), the fees will go up, sometimes to as much as $0.20, to make sure your transaction gets in.

That's not what my friends who got involved in the protest and were heavily involved in it said. Nor was it the reason they stated for why they and everyone else there were protesting. Nobody there got paid to do that.
Yes, I forgot the other reason, Ukraine discovered large amounts of shale gas, Russian economy heavily depends on it (50% of GDP, and 70%+ of government income comes from oil), and Ukraine becoming a competitor to Russian monopoly on providing oil to Europe would have been very bad for Russia. Coincidentally, those shale oil fields are also under the disputed territories. As you said, follow the money.

Right now you need 1,800 worth of fees to flood the network. At bare minimum 0.01mBTC fee that's $4.86 per block, at normal 0.1mBTC that's $48.60 per block (using current $270 exchange rate). If we increase the block size by 20, to get the same flooding effect you would need 20 times as many transactions, and 20 times as many fees, or $97.20 per block if you're being cheap, and $972 if you want to be effective. Basically, you have to throw almost $1,000 at the system every ten minutes to cause it to do what it's doing now, instead of $50.
The guys who claimed they wanted to do this stress test pledges $5,000 in fees. At 1mb block that gives them enough funds to build a spam transaction queue of between 1 and 7 days ($5000 / $4.86 / 6 block per hour / 24 hours in a day). If we were to move to a 20mb block, that same $5,000 amount would give them at most $5000/$97.20/6/24 = about 1/3rd of a day worth. They would need to waste 20 times as much money to have the same effect.
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:12:05
If 75% of nodes and miners accept the new fork, the remaining 25% will switch so as to not be left on the weaker, easier to attack chain. Consensus will be unanimous. And the switch is entirely based on individuals and mining pools switching nodes, not done by two developers. This letter makes it sound as if the fork is being forced somehow, or that it could result in a fork in the first place, as opposed to stragglers having to convert as quickly as possible.

(copy/paste from e-mail, so others can use for reference)
Do you have "Economic" fee set by default in your wallet settings? Low fee transactions are having issues of sometimes disappearing or taking a very long time (days sometimes) to confirm right now, probably because after the "stress test" nodes are rejecting them as spam transactions. The transaction should have been broadcast and should be out there, but it may be that not all nodes see it. It should eventually confirm though. Does the other guy see the transaction in his wallet? If yes, he could highlight it, select "Show Details," and share the link of the transaction hash, which you can verify on blockchain.info or elsewhere.
If nothing shows up by tomorrow (Sunday latest), then you can try sending him that amount again directly. In the mean time, please check your settings and change the default fee to at least "Normal" to avoid such issues in the future.
@_date: 2015-07-16 03:30:21
Actually those transactions did have fees, and in some cases pretty good ones. That's why they clogged the network instead of just being rejected.
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:30:49
It just means the node you connected at that point isn't fully caught up to the rest of the blockchain. We updated two of the nodes, and had to get them to sync up, which takes a day or two. You may need to go to the Accounts menu, select your account, and pick Reload Account from the dropdown menu.

The problem here wasn't exactly bitcoin failing, but rather *some* bitcoin services and wallets failing, for failing to maintain their software and keep up with the updates, or being too risky with experimentation. Those services may fail, others will go on. It's no different from MtGox failure supposedly adding support to altcoins. Failure is also a sign of progress and continued improvements. Not only does it give the project more information about what to avoid and how to become stronger, but if things just stay the same, then there's a good chance it's because no one is really doing anything.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:07:45
Yeah, we're internally debating on whether to change that. On the one hand, people giving 1 stars to obvious scammers can get them off the list, but on the other allowing people to rate can lead to reputation scams, where people build up reputation by doing small trades, and then using that perfect reputation to steal a large amount from someone. As this point, since we are recommending that all trades be done in person, the side that claims all we need is whether the trader is responsive and how quickly they follow through is all that matters.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:03:16
When Mycelium started people didn't have very powerful phones, and most common data type was still 2G. It took a long time, sometimes half a minute or more, for a true SPV wallet to synchronize your wallet every time you opened it to pay. Mycelium used custom nodes to speed up the process, handling all the heavy bitcoin stuff on the back end, and just sending address balances to users. So there was definitely a need for this centralized model. Now, with faster phones and more bandwidth, it's not needed as much, and as this experience has shown we definitely need to decentralize our back end.

For the last week and a half someone has been performing a "stress test" on the network by flooding it with thousands of tiny transactions that still pay a fee. It has been filling blocks to the limit, where each 1mb block can fit only about 1000 to 2000 transaction, and the current backlog is about 35,000 to 45,000 transactions. Every time another flood of thousands or ten thousand comes in, nodes have to verify all of them.
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:40:35
Confirmed, It just failed sending, didn't show anything about storing the transaction, and allowed me to send the second time again. Luckily both transactions came from the same input, and were for more than half of the amount I had in my wallet, so the second one got invalidated.

There shouldn't be any "no servers" any more. Wonder if another one hickuped again. If you are on Android, you can go to About in the drop down menu, scroll down to Connection Logs, and and see which node you are connecting to now. If you get "no server," back out of the app completely to close it, and start it again, checking if you are on a different node. Most of them seem to work fine. You can also install Orbot app and connect through Tor (go to Settings, and scroll down to "Use tor-network." Some users have reported it to be a bit more stable of a connection.
If you are on iOS, I don't know how that handles connections, but it's probably similar.

Since I use bitcoin for ALL my daily purchases, believe me, I know your frustration. And I am aware that we are likely to lose a lot of users over this. Currently we are working to separate Bitcoin Core node processing from the database that gives you your balances and receives your broadcast transactions, so that if one laggs, like they have been, it won't kill your wallet functionality. Afterwards I will strongly insist to the team that we make SPV functionality our TOP priority. This stress test has pretty much proved conclusively that we can no longer stay centralized the way we have been.
The reason we started with the nodes was because instant address balance look-up was not available years ago when we first created the wallet, and Mycelium app was specifically designed to run on very weak and cheap phones, where most of the bitcoin processing would be done on our nodes. Now phones are much faster, and bitcoin node functionality is available to allow us to look up address balances just like our nodes allow, so there's no excuse not to do it any more.

It "proves" it because he was a high-level member of the protest, with lots of contacts with people on the ground. I don't know what to make of the links about this being US sponsored. Ukraine has been asking for financial help for a while, and barely got any of it. Also, no one who was protesting got paid. My friend provided IT services out of his own business's pocket, people paid for their own food and water, and much of the food was donated by parents who used their own pension money to buy it and deliver it to the protesters (which is what my other friend's mother did). If it was sponsored by US, then none of that money ended up going towards the protests themselves.

I was born in Kiev as well, and still have relatives and friends there, too. With regards to the Neonazis, they are real, but they are blown way out of proportion. Have you seen this before?  Russian media literally caught in their lie. Russian government hacked Ukrainian voting systems and installed a virus that would make Yarosh win with 37% of the vote. Ukrainian cyber security department discovered the virus and removed it, without telling anyone. When the election happened, "somehow" Russian TV reported the election results as being the exact same that their virus would have resulted in. In the end, Ukraine elected Nazis with less than 2% of the vote. The irony about Russia scaring everyone with threats of Nazis in Ukraine is that [Russia has half of the world's total neo-Nazi population]( This is a MASSIVELY bigger problem in Russia than in any other country in the world.

Currently we have the same process/PC doing both core and Mycelium server, so if the core gets flooded with transactions and lags, it lags the whole computer. We're making these two work in parallel instead, and may split them into separate computers, so one lagging won't affect the other.
One thing we are considering is using libbitcoin nodes for our SPV, since I believe that allows for instant address lookup, same as what our Mycelium database does.

My friend ran the IT and WiFi for all of Maidan. He wasn't just a common protester. And he and others talked to the rest of the people there. Their reason was that the pro-russian president was elected on promises he didn't keep, didn't want to join EU despite that being one of his promises, tried to change the constitution to give himself permanent presidency with dictatorial powers, and once the protests started, declared that anyone who protests will automatically get a minimum 15 years in prison. At that point the protesters only had two options: quit and go to prison, or stay until he is kicked out.
Russia started this by first ordering their puppet to shoot at the protesters. Yanukovich actually refused to shoot at his own people, so good on him, so then Russia brought in their own snipers, and that's when the shooting on Maidan began. Many of the "Ukrainian" snipers who were shooting at protesters were photographed, and then later recognized as the exact same people righting as Russian soldiers in the east.
Russia then followed up by creating a massive propaganda campaign (which you unfortunately fell for) claiming that Ukraine is being overrun by nazis and is going to elect a nazi as their president (turned out Ukraine voted less fascist than even UK and France). People in the east panicked, then russian troops, or russian funded criminals, started a shooting war there, increasing the panic, and a vote was held on whether to stay with Ukraine or secede. FYI, the vote was 97%+ for. NO vote ever reaches that level, other than old Soviet fake ones.
Thing is, this isn't a unique, or even a first time that something like this happened: 
You think you know, because you read "secret" countermedia reports, but you don't.

I see it as being based on NOT trusting others, and verifying everyone as much as possible. If you use BitcoinJ SPV, and get Sybil attacked, you're pretty much f'ed unless you can connect to a legit node and see that all other Sybils are lying to you. With the current situation you just have to connect to enough nodes to know that something is up. Maybe BitcoinJ will add some verification to trust the newest versions of nodes, or something.

Block size is how many transactions are in a block. Currently block size is artifically limited to 1mb, which allows for an average of 3 transactions per second, or about 1,800 every block every 10 minutes. Raising it to 20mb per block would allow blocks that can handle about 36,000 transactions in every block, or 60 transactions per second.
The reason the whole Bitcoin network is bogged down so much right now is because we have had more than 3 transactions per second for a few days, which has made every block fill to its 1mb limit, and has built up a huge queue of transactions that are just sitting waiting to be included.

@_date: 2015-07-15 16:18:19
Our back end is basically bitcoin core, and another database on top of it that extracts address balances. I think that's pretty much what Electrum server does, also running on top of core and extracting balances from that. Actually, I haven't used Electrum in a while, so I don't even remember if the client has to synchronize headers and update balances by asking the server to rescan the blockchain every time. From what I understand, libbitcoin allows you to get address balances instantly like we do (though I need to confirm that), and there are a few libbitcoin nodes running out there already. So connecting to those will give us what we need, and will allow us to be more decentralized too.

Someone is losing money on fees spamming the network right now. Miners are probably making a nice bonus from it too. So I suspect that the current situation will go away. But if transaction rate does go up from normal increase in bitcoin use, then we'll just adjust for it by increasing "normal" and "priority" fees, or adding a way to dynamically calculate fees.


It probably depends on the miner/pool, since by default transactions get included based on their priority, not their fee, and age of transaction (or is it age of coins in the transaction?) is part of that priority. So transactions that have sat for a long time will eventually have a higher priority score than even transactions with higher fees. Of course, some miners will change that to only include transactions with some high amount of fee, but I doubt that will be all of them.


We just finished BIP70 integration, which was a lot of work, and we're just finishing up Coinapult integration, so users can lock their bitcoin value to avoid volatility. Hopefully that will help with bitcoin adoption, especially for merchants, and especially since merchants will be able to hold bitcoin instead of just sell them for fiat right away. But our main priority is adding more anonymization features. We would love to have CoinJoin built in by default, for instance. Smart fees are pretty low on our priority list right now.

Except private key storage and signing, storing the transaction history, or having clear text versions of localtrader chats. Basically exactly the same as any other SPV wallet, but with dedicated nodes.
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:06:50
No, since the BIP standard for HD wallet allowed for a look-ahead of only 20 addresses. If you create 20 empty addresses and send a transaction again to a 21st address, you won't see your money unless you specifically hack the wallet code to work. So, to keep the wallet as a basic user type app, we kept it from creating new addresses. You could create a new transaction, sending some small amount to yourself, which will create a new address, and then use that address for your other outputs, but that probably won't keep you as anonymous. When I was doing this, I actually used Armory for creating addresses and balances, since that wallet gives you full address control, but it takes a lot of computer resources to run.

Not having 95% is not a problem, as long as majority agrees on a good fork to follow. All that means is that miners who slacked off have been taught a horrible lesson to never do that again.
It was fixed. It if wasn't fixed, we would be on the old version. Things would still run.
Anyone who doesn't upgrade gets told by the market to GTFO, because their services won't be welcome. It's a self enforcing loop. All the correct incentives are still there. If that hashing power was blind before, losing money should be a good feedback on what that hashing power should do.

Not really. It's just stuff discussed among developers, mining pool operators, and sometimes miners. Basically it's very easy to make the attacker's hardware completely obsolete, with minimal damage to bitcoin itself, and the hope is that since attackers would know this, they wouldn't bother.

I'm actually not sure if it will broadcast it eventually or not. I'm assuming you have already tried closing and restarting the app, to check if it will rebroadcast when you go to LT again.
FYI, the guy you were dealing with has e-mailed us as well, asking about this issue. He gave an address that he thinks the coins should have been sent to, but it may have been the following, not the receiving address. I asked him to check for past addresses in hopes that we can track down the transaction, if it exists.
In any case, we do have his contact information as well, so if there are any issued of "missing" coins, we can contact him about it. BTW, this is pretty much the ONLY time we managed to get involved in a transaction directly, as typically we have no idea who is trading, so that we can avoid being an escrow or intermediary.

Bit of a pro-socialist slant from this report (with "bit" being an understatement).
"the paper further considers blockchain 2.0 technologies"
Typical cop-out for those who don't like bitcoin, but like everything it does. There is no blockchain 2.0. There's just services added to Bitcoin itself.
"...there remain doubts as to the viability of the digital currency within countries with limited access to internet services and infrastructure, he says... bitcoin usage needs consistent availability of both Internet and electricity."
Or a cheap cell phone and a solar panel. In poorest African nations there are more cell phones than there are people.
"Scott also takes the opportunity to offer a more political critique, saying [it's better to] seek more fundamental solutions to a country’s underlying problems on the ground".
Advocating that the adoption of bitcoin by "vulnerable" nations is, at best, probably a short-term solution, he says it "distracts countries from strengthening already fragile institutions"."
Except that in most cases those already "fragile" institutions are the reason the nations are vulnerable in the first place, with their either dictator like control of their economies, misguided economy-killing subsidies and aid, or rampant corruption. Bitcoin allows people to bypass either of those.
"in a country like Zimbabwe the real need may be to strengthen the integrity of the banking system"
That's like saying that in a country that has problems with long distance communication, it's best to focus on strengthening their telegraph systems, instead of putting up cell phone towers.  Bitcoin bypasses the need for a banking system, and opens its users up to the entire global market.
Basically another case of someone being worried about those "radicals" trying to come up with new ways of doing things, instead of the tried and true (and disastrously failed) social structures and traditional banking systems.

That's not true. He has the exact same interest to destabilize Ukraine as he had to destabilize ~~Romania~~ Moldova (Transnistria) and Georgia (Abkhazia). By NATO rules, any country with disputed borders can not join NATO. Romania and Georgia tried to join NATO, and were invaded, where the conflict is still going on unresolved. Ukraine wanted to join EU and NATO, and was invaded for the same reason. The other interest that Putin had in a war with Ukraine is that thanks to oil prices dropping, Russia's economy completely tanked, and Putin's ratings went down as well. By waging a war, he was able to create a "common enemy" that everyone in Russia can fear, hate, and rally around defeating, and it brought up his ratings, as well as that of the rest of the government. It's no different from Bush going to war with Iraq.
If we follow the money, the only thing that we will find is that there's barely any of it being spent there by outsiders at all. With regards to MSM, there are only two competing views on what's going on there, the "MSM" that is claiming Putin invaded, which consists of all media in Ukraine, Eastern Europe nations, US, Europe, South America, and most of Asia (China is trying to stay neutral), and the only opposing view is coming from RussiaToday (RT) and blogs that simply repost RT's stories. RT is literally owned by the Russian government. 
Personally, I believe the people living in Ukraine and dealing with this personally. They happen to corroborate MSM's stories.

What? Why?


No I'm not. They're free to stick with their own fork, lose money, or try to win others over by getting them to switch to their fork instead. Or evenj modify their fork to not interfere with the other one, and have their own separate altcoin. Nor do they even have to rely on Bitcoin Core. Other bitcoin node software can include or exclude support for BIPs too. And if they get screwed and lose their money, so what? Free market, baby!

Mycelium fees are static, and were set to work fine in "normal" conditions, while the network wasn't being flooded. The extremely high fees that bitcoinfees is showing right now are mainly because there are so many transactions stuck in mempool competing for space. That's not normal. Regardless, economic fees should still confirm. Generally any transaction with a fee will eventually be picked up by a miner, since otherwise they will be throwing away money. It's only the free ones you have to watch out for.
We at Mycelium have been considering implementing a dynamically calculated fee, which would be calculated on our own nodes and the info forwarded to the wallet, but we simply have not had time for it yet.

It's a standard way of broadcasting, but a lot of nodes and public network block explorers (like blockchain.info) don't get all the same transactions. Often a node gets its memory filled up with transactions, rejects any new ones submitted to it (such as by us), and any node that connects through that one doesn't see it. So, transactions can exist sporadically around nodes, and may not show up until the memory is cleared by a confirmed block, or until it gets in a block and all nodes are forced to recognize it.
I would recommend against using Economic fees for a while, since with the spam flood, which is actually paying fees, it may mean your transaction will be stuck in the back of the queue for days.

BitPay monitors for unconfirmed inputs, and will not allow such a transaction to go through until the prior inputs are confirmed. I found this out by accident when I sent a single transaction with 100 outputs and zero fee to a bunch of paper wallets from Mycelium, then tried to buy a gift card through Gyft the next day, when the prior transaction wasn't confirmed yet, and the BitPay payment was stuck as processing. It only got resolved when the initial 100 outputs transaction got confirmed a day later, along with the BitPay one, and I e-mailed BitPay support, which pushed it through and got me the gift card.

EDIT: **Oh hell no!** It took me ten minutes of reading the documentation to find out that there is no way to actually post journal entries using Ledger - you have to use a text editor to manipulate the file directly - and all Ledger does is analyze the data. No thanks! I need accounting software, one that lets me easily post entries with simple categories, has easy to find drop-down lists of accounts, easily search and jump between accounts, and reconcile list of transactions. With Ledger, your accounting software is basically Notepad.exe, and Ledger is just a reporting tool :( This is GREAT for a basic check book, but I will lose WAY more time on reading the documentation and on manually looking for and changing things around, than it could possibly be worth it. The whole system just screams "user error." Yeah, after an hour of reading the documentation, this system is stupidly inefficient, and not for me.

We have discussed it, yes. We had people requesting such a feature for things like selling tickets, where they wanted to issue an address to a lot of people at the same time, and then track who paid by checking the address. We decided against implementing this due to time/resource constraints (our devs have more important features to work on right now), and because we wanted to keep our wallet simple.
We have a service called Mycelium Gear which creates merchant invoices, and it also uses Mycelium wallet's addresses (you export the public portion of your HD keys to Gear, so any payments made go straight into your wallet). There customers can create invoices over and over, and Gear will give them a new address every time, but after some number of addresses it will check the first one, and if it's not used, will circle around and start giving the same ones again, rotating through them until they get filled up.

It's not the single transaction I'm interested in, it's what is in the OTHER account before or after the transaction that was done in this account. Entering everything in a single flat file for a single account is dead easy, and yes, I would just use a text file for that. What I **need** is something that lets me keep track of many accounts at the same time, that are linked by transaction, and allow me to easily jump between them. Yes, I can open multiple windows with multiple files, but there is nothing actually linking one transaction to another, other than me searching by date or something. I'm glad it works for you, but it just doesn't cut it for anything complex.
More specific example. I have a cash account. Money keeps coming in and out for expenses. In the middle of it, there's a transaction to cover an Accounts Payable account. My Accounts Payable is off by some amount, and is also linked to Accounts Receivable. I need to compare the two and see where there is an erroneous transaction that, ALTHOUGH CORRECTLY ENTERED FROM ACCOUNTING POINT OF VIEW, is not in the right place or taking money from the wrong account. GUI accounting software lets me click-jump directly between linked transactions, scroll around, and see where something may have come in that shouldn't have. I imagine with this, I'm limited to searching manually.

Just tell them that since Bitcoin is a P2P network where EVERYONE has to verify and agree on all bitcoins to make sure that they follow specified rules, anyone creating their own bitcoins will just have bitcoins that only they will have. They won't be able to send or spend those bitcoins, and those bitcoins will be worthless, because the network as a whole, i.e. everyone running a Bitcoin client, will reject them.
It's no different than printing USD on a home printer on tissue paper. It won't be spendable, won't be accepted by anyone, and won't have any effect on real USD.

III. I think the issue is that when you publicly distribute your BTC address, you may end up losing some of your privacy regarding whom that address, and any it's linked to, belongs to. However, since this is about building up a public reputation and signing contracts, I guess it would be fairly irrelevant as to whether the public reputation is based on a Bitcoin address for a PGP key. The other issue I heard is that having a public Bitcoin address exposed puts you at risk of your private key being broken by a quantum computer. That part IS relevant. It may not be now, but it would be pretty crappy to have built up a reputation around a single Bitcoin address, only to have quantum computers come on to the scene and not be able to do anything about them. So you're right about that.
IV. One example I brought up was being able to sign a contract that includes a payout address, with the actual payout address. In that case, you wouldn't even need to know the identity of the person on the receiving end of the contract. Though I guess a similar thing can be established with PGP, as long as there is enough trust that the payout address and the PGP signature belong to the same person. But for the most part, yes, it's mostly about ease-of-use. More specifically, I think signing using keys is a damn good thing that should be used more often, and it may just be way easier to get people to do it using their BTC wallets than teaching them GPG (as in I.) Maybe someone can write a BTC wallet that implements GPG features as well, in which case users will have the best of both worlds, and will be "forced" to have the feature in their hands? Though I'm not convinced enough people think that would be a good idea yet (bloatware?). Guess we'll just have to see which takes off on it's own: GPG, or more users using their BTC signing features.

@_date: 2012-10-25 19:05:27
Totally agree, though I would MUCH prefer Bitcoin address signed contracts, because:
* BTC signing provides the same level of verification security and functionality as GPG (minus key servers that let you search for identities/e-mail addresses, but no reason those won't appear)
*Both Bitcoin and GPG require use of third party software, however, while GPG requires you to learn new software, how to create and manage keys, and how to make backups, Bitcoin already includes those requirements as well. I.e. with Bitcoin it's all-in-one, like a camera phone, and arguably Bitcoin will be way more ubiquitous than GPG (everyone will use Bitcoin, anyway, so it's small step towards signing)
* While GPG has specialized propagating key servers, BTC's equivalent infrastructure is already built in, with the distributed blockchain, which is much more difficult to spoof/tamper with than a key server that decides to serve incorrectly identifiable info (fake e-mail, etc tied to keys)
* Bitcoin let's you tie your financial history to your identity. If a contract is signed with two addresses, stating that address A will pay address B later, it is easy to verify whether A has indeed paid B, and so on.
The only thing left that GPG has that BTC doesn't is the ability to store e-mail addresses and other identifiable information with a BTC address. That can probably be easilly fixed by storing address-signed text with transactions that also continue to live in the block chain, or perhaps through a third party in some way.

I don't need it to track investments. That's easy. And if that's all you're using it for - to keep track of your BTC investments and stocks, I can see how it can be simpler. What I need accounting for is business accounting. Things like accruals, receivables/payables, and tracking credit and expense reports for customers and vendors. I think Ledger would be way too cumbersome to use for that.
@_date: 2012-10-24 15:06:08
No, I wouldn't invest, because it still sounds like bullshit. Pirate claimed that he made more than enough profit from the USD side of things to cover the ridiculously high 7% a week return? My first question would have been why the hell are his customers paying him such a huge rate just to invest in or trade BTC? Even Gox can handle 500k BTC buys and sells if done over the course of a few weeks, and the fee paid by investors would not only be much smaller, but would be recouped on the sell-off. So, at the very least, his "business" would last only until his customers realized that they were being ripped off, and decided to go elsewhere, which in the case of his fees wouldn't have been very long.
@_date: 2012-10-16 14:12:10
To be fair, the entire Magic the Gathering portion of MtGox was completely wiped out after the Summer 2011 hack, since the exchange code was rewritten from scratch to avoid unknown security holes. The owner of MtGox is not the same either. And they likely changed servers since then, too. So, really, the only thing left from the original Magic the Gathering exchange is the name.

1 - I did account for the one more hop. Thus my FIAT &gt; BTC &gt; BTC &gt; FIAT thing. If you mean the hop from exchange fiat to local bank, that's usually the same hop as from wiring service to bank
2 - They can trade BTC for cash, as some already do.
3 and 4, yeah, it's more for people running their own business or trying to sell their services online (orogramming, design, etc). People already do this using btc.
5 - not average, but  doesn't apply, because there are places you can't wire money to, not just that the fees are high.
6 - there will likely always be someone accepting free transactions. Currently, though, we have bitcointip bot and SatoshiDice. A ¢1 transaction fee for BTC is also way smaller than a ¢25 fee using other services, so I'm not sure what you're objecting to. And even if things do end up with each web service having it's own account that does micropayments using just accounting entries, it would still be better with BTC, since sending money from one site to another can be done with btc directly (the way you withdraw Reddit tips to an exchange), instead of withdrawing to a bank, waiting a day or two, depositing to the new site, and waiting again. But point is this is happening now.
8 - Average people use the bitcointip bot, and it's not that much of a stretch to open a Bitcoin exchange account to transfer money in/out compared to doing it through PayPal.

@_date: 2012-10-25 22:04:13
I guess it depends on what you want to use it for. If you just want to prove that an e-mail came from you, use GPG. If you want to sign a contract that may have financial transactions involved, I think BTC is better and offers more options (e.g. this contract, signed by this BTC address, is fulfilled once the address used to sign it gets this payment). And, again, key point is that if BTC takes off, everyone will have access to a BTC client, meaning public and private keys with easilly accessible signature options in the client (current Bitcoin-qt and blockchain.info clients already have it). GPG you actually have to convince people to download, set up, and use. If VISA had GPG-like functionality built in, I would be suggesting to use that instead.
Bitcoin can sign while disconnected, too. Only difference is you use BTC address and private key instead of PGP public and private keys.

The article talks specifically about **GPG signed** contracts, not encrypted contracts. Bitcoins don't do anything like SSL, but like GPG they are a pair of public and private keys, and can do the same function.

As with everything that makes questionable financial sense, always ask, "Where is the money coming from?" Money doesn't just magically appear (especially BTC), so someone out there is giving up a lot of it to get the bonds to grow. Is it from fees on trades? That would mean a lot of people may be losing on securities, and this thing is more like gambling. Is it irrational exuberance from a few hopeful traders? That would only last until that runs out. Is it a specific service people are willing to pay and lose a lot of money for? Hope that competition won't come too soon.

The well connected node thing is true. You can set your Bitcoin system to connect to blockchain.info and a few largest mining pools, and that will make sure you are within a few hops of pretty much any Bitcoin client out there. Any transaction will be instantly transmitted to everyone who matters (especially mining pools), and any double-spend attempts will be rejected, since almost everyone would have already heard about the first transaction. It would take maybe a second or three for the other Bitcoin client to see that it's receiving money, and no need to wait for 10 minute verification.

My specific situation is Cash = Unearned Revenue + Income.

Any errors during monthly reconciliation could be from a number of factors, from entering wrong received amounts, to charging them an incorrect amount, to even charging them twice because I forgot I charged them already (I know, stupid and careless).

You can't "get in trouble" for "dos"in the blockchain. Either you can DDoS it, in which case we're all fucked, or you can't, in which case we're OK. Just because there are more small transactions than people hoped for doesn't mean it can't handle them. The system can almost handle VISA level transaction volume, so I seriously doubt they can overwhelm it. Check the wiki entry for scalability.

If you want to take money out into your local currency, you still need to set up an account at an exchange. However, what that most anti-bitcoin people who claim "I can already use my VISA/PayPal/Bank for stuff" forget is that they had to go through the long and arduous process of setting up their bank account and VISAs, so there's really no difference there.

It happens just because mining is so random. It's basically millions of computers throwing millions of dice. On average somebody will get lucky every 10 minutes, but there is a small percent chance that it could take 20 minutes, and an even smaller percent that it'll take 30 minutes or longer. Recently we had the mining reward halve, which made mining unprofitable for a lot of people, so yeah, we had a lot of people duck out, but yes, it should get better once difficulty readjusts in about 6 days

This is quite excellent for the following reason: A lot of specific type of stock out there (someone remind me?) has a base price (often $1), meaning if things go to hell, the company MUST reimburse you for the base value of their stock. The corp is actually required to keep enough cash to cover their stock base price. With this option, you can issue stock shares that have a base price built in, that being the value of BTC itself, meaning if your company dies, people still have the value of btc, and also meaning you can forgo the complicated accounting having to deal with tracking outstanding stock shares and making sure you have cash to cover it. You can also tell the market how confident you are in your business based on how much premium you charge on your stock (what's your share price at IPO) compared to the value of the underlying bitcoin per share. E.g. a $10 share might be on top of $1 worth of bitcoin, or on top of $9 worth, signaling you being either crazy, or somewhat conservative in your expectations.

Communication issue was pretty much the main one. My phone doesn't work overseas, so that would have been useless. Yes, some planning ahead would have helped, and my windows of opportunity were specifically due to lack of a way to communicate. I was there with my parents, so I couldn't make them stop and wait for me for too long, meaning my window of opportunity was restricted to sending out a message in the few minutes I'm near open WiFi and they are browsing a shop, with only a guess as to where I'll be in a few hours. So, yeah, it was an annoying hassle. Had I been able to find a data SIM card and could quickly set it up while there, things would've gone a lot smoother. Not too sure the university thing would have helped unless we scheduled to meet there earlier, but had we agreed to meet somewhere earlier, none of this would've been an issue. All my fault though. Not blaming you in the least. My only point with this post was to point out that it's a bit difficult to trade Bitcoin if you are dropped into another country without your own internet access.
As for the localbitcoin escrow service, I've never really understood why that's even there. If I send you Bitcoin, you give me cash, and we wait 5 to 10 minutes for a confirmation, there is pretty much no way for me to scam you. The only benefit I see from paying that 1% fee is if we did the transaction using PayPal, or some other reversible method (I would be the only one at risk of getting scammed, since my Bitcoin transaction is irreversible), or to have localbitcoin register the exchange as successfully completed. I've done about 6 trades with people through localbitcoins so far without relying on their escrow, with no problems.

Cards like these work on a pull principle (you give the merchant the account  and they pull whatever amount they wish), while the Bitcoin works as a push only (you yourself have to specify the amount, and "push" the money to the merchant). Only viable option is for Google to hold your bitcoins on your behalf (like MtGox), assume they have your complete permission to spend any and all of it, and convert&amp;push it to the merchant when you slide the card. That's not happening any time soon, but it IS something BitInstant is apparently working on.
Ideally, though, we would want something where a merchant's machine will give us the amount and address to pay to (printer QR code or NFC transmission), the transaction comes up on our phone or BitcoinCard, and we have to hit confirm to send the money. This would make sure that card holding Bitcoin can not be stolen (as credit cards can be just by stealing the numbers on it), and we will know exactly how much is being taken.

I'm aware, yes. But, please, compare the two technologies. One does encryption, the other does financial transaction, but how are they different when it comes to public/private keys signing and verifying messages? Isn't the underlying technology virtually the same? And if yes, why NOT push BTC signing? I would be all for getting people to use GPG more, but practically no one I know uses it, or even knows how to, while BTC gives everyone practically the same functionality, and is much easier to convince people to use.

Regarding loans, I beg to differ. Interest is literally the cost or price of risk. Interest is charged on loans based on the risk that the money will be paid back. Even if Bitcoin grows in value, loans denominated in Bitcoin will still have to charge interest to account for the risk associated with the borrower. As a result, Bitcoin loans will have a higher nominal interest that FRN and Euro loans. I had a discussion about how to make Bitcoin loans possible on the Bitcointalk.org list about a year ago. The best solution we came up with is prepaying a lot of the loan up front, so the nominal amount (number of) of bit coins you pay is much more at the beginning of the loan than the end, but the actual value, what it's worth, remains level due to Bitcoin deflation.
Overall, though, I think switching to Bitcoin will really limit the ability of people to borrow money, and the economy will become more savings based than loan based.  Not sure that's a good thing, since short term (30 to 180 day) loans drive our economy, and help people start new businesses.

Why do you say Americans make up most of the purchases? I was under the impression that Europe did. I am fairly confident that eventually third world places like India and Africa will surpass everyone, since Bitcoin is much more valuable where there aren't any banks and getting money in/out of the country is difficult.
Also, I've never even used Bit instant. I used to use Dwolla, now I just send money directly through ING Direct. In the end it doesn't matter, because even if it's banned in half of the world's countries, it can just continue to survive in the other half of the world. Its benefits are not unique to Americans.

It will be profitable in the short run, but less and less profitable in the long run. Eventually over time your profits will be near zero. Reason is that more and more people will start mining, taking more and more of your profits for themselves.
The only way to stay profitable over the long run is to keep buying newer and newer mining technology that may give you a temporary edge over old tech miners, at least until they catch up as well.

If he was the only one buying and selling, he would break even at best. Let's say there ate 10BTC total, and 10 price points. He sells 10BTC, bringing the price/BTC down to $1, then he buys 10BTC, bringing the price to $10, and in the end he has 10BTC worth $10 each. But he's not in the market alone. Other people are buying and selling too, so he sells 10BTC, but someone buys 2 of them, bring the price up by $2, then when he buys back, he either gets 8BTC worth for his $10, or he has to spend $12 to buy the same 10BTC back. In the end he is $2 poorer. Now, he COULD buy on the momentum, starting a slide, then stop contributing to it, wait for it to hit bottom, and buy in, but that's a very risky/difficult maneuver, and judging by the market and Btc still going up, he's failed.

Example: I need to get a list of all transactions in my cash account, sorted by date, and a list of all my account receivables sorted by date. At some point, someone made  a deposit against their invoice which was entered as a wrong amount. Because of that, my cash account no longer matches my blockexplorer.com ledger. The entries just before and just after the point where it goes out of sync are correct, so the issue is that the time is not in exact sequence (multiple entries on the same day, but in a different order than what blockchain shows). Typically  I keep the Cash and the Accounts Receivable open in two windows, and check entries to see where it went out of sync, and which ones match the correct amounts. The error could be that I entered an amount different from what I actually received, or that  I entered what I was supposed to get, but they underpaid.  I need a lot of easily viewable information. What can Ledger do for me?
By the way, just went to the documentation page, hit Ctrl-F, and typed Aging. Zero hits. Do I have to code that as a custom report?
Can't find a list of customers, either
And finally,  I am running GNUCash off of a USB stick, being able to open it at work on Windows, and at home on Linux. Can Ledger accommodate that? (I guess if the account sheet is just a Notepad editable file, and Leger is just a report system,  I can add journal entrees, but not do any lookup or reporting on it)

It **really** depends on the opinion or statements. They have a rather blurry line between "challenging someone's opinion for being inconsistent/illogical" and "being a smartass," and that line is usually defined by whether the group as a whole is for or against the topic being discussed. I've been watching their forums and activities for a.. wow, close to ten years too now (since about '03 or '04), and my first bf has been a member for at least as long, too, and that's generally what I've noticed. In a way, they hold almost religious beliefs about various topics, and anyone with differing or more informed opinions, even if correct ones, is kicked out as a heretic. Though it's really closer to them thinking they are a part of the "Cool Kids" club, who's sole reason is to make fun of the nerdy kids, and point out to each other how much cooler everyone in their group is compared to them, so anyone agreeing with the nerdy kids risks being shunned, and thus stays quiet.

You can't spend them as easily as cash. Yeah, that's a given. No one was arguing, or is being asked to argue that. Way too many people seem to focus on where you can spend it, too, as if that's all it'll ever be good for. The question was, why would someone who isn't a conspiracy gold-nut even care at this point? The answer is it already trumps some types of financial services. Not everyone needs to send money overseas, but not everyone uses Reddit, or posts to Deviant art, either. But if you **do** do any of those things, Bitcoin is a better option. The bigger point is that we're not just some crazy futurist nerds sitting around jerking each other off about how awesome this virtual currency will be in the future. We, and people who don't care about mining, inflation, or what have you, are already using it, and that list is how.

Solution is Bitcoin-qt v0.8 that's coming out soon. You won't need to have the entire blockchain to start using it. Also, using online services doesn't break the concept of decentralization too much. There are still a whole lot of competing online wallet services.
1. A secret password that let's you spend coins assigned to it, basically. Think of a safety deposit box with some money in, locked with a combination lock. Your Bitcoin is the combination to that lock you store in a file (or in your head). When you want to send the money to someone else, you unlock the box with your combination, and stick it into a slot in their box. Now they are the only ones with the combination to open the box and spend it. So a Bitcoin is this "thing" that's not quite a thing, existing between the actual money in the box, and the combination to open that box.
2. You only need the private key. The public key can be reconstructed from the private key. The rest of the info there is just your address book, transaction history, etc.
3. The system stores a ledger that tracks every coin since it was created. If your wallet address has any coins in it, the accounting ledger has a history of how it got there, and knows that it's still sitting there. It's all only against the blockchain.
4. See  You create a transaction saying you are transferring some Bitcoin to a different address, and sign that transaction using your private key that's associated with the address they're coming from. This proves to the network that you own the coins. Once the coins are delivered to the destination address (and verified by being included in a miner), they sit there, with the blockchain ledger holding a record that these coins and in such and such address, until the owner of the new address creates their own signed transaction.
Regarding your bad experience, I think it had more to do with you still using a year old tools that have been replaced since (except the annoying blockchain download). Since you really only need your private key to store and transfer bitcoins, there are a lot of much easier to use tools for that out now.

But that's exactly what insurance does. Whether car, home, medical, or life, super-smart math people called actuaries estimate the cost of risk to insure a group, say for example "one out of every 20 houses will burn down this year, costing $50,000 to repair," and split the cost among the group being insured, in this case each of the 20 houses paying 1/20th of  that repair cost annually, or $2,500. Then, if everything goes according to plan, everyone will pay into the $50,000 pot, and the money will go out to pay for that one burned down house. The only differences here are that private insurance companies charge $3,000 a month and keep the $500 as profit. This also gives them a bit of a cash buffer to risk their money in investments, since if they win, they'll increase profits, and if they lose, they'll still have enough to cover payout claims. Social Security doesn't make profits, and can't afford to risk any money, so it works like my example above, taking in only $50,000, and paying out that $50,000 every time it's needed (I.e. monthly)

The article talks about contracts signed by GPG keys, with the GPG key being an established identity with its own history. Basically, instead of signing using your name using pen and paper, and using yourself as the one with reputation to put behind the contract, these GPG contracts would be signed using your GPG signature, and would use the public reputation of the GPG signature as reputation.
TL;DR: 2 different things, but GPG can **only** sign (and encrypt), while BTC can sign, store/transfer money, has built-in publicly verifiable transaction history, and will soon be used by more people (and can probably be used to encrypt as well). I never even used GPG until I was forced to with bitcoin-otc, and now with address signing I don't have to use if for that either.

Edit: I guess in that case it would be worth whatever Bitcoin is worth, with the guarantee that if btc value ever drops, this btc won't drop below the value of the share? But what effect will that have on the company itself?

Not any more. Drop in reward + ASIC means you'll probably make about 1/40th of today's estimated income in about two or three months. You likely will never recoup your initial costs, and will spend more time (money) on keeping the stated running than you will earn from mining.

I would strongly advise against using USB keys for backup. They degrade just as badly as old burnable CDs did (high chance you will lose your backup within one to two years).
Better option for what you want to do is to go to  save the web page to your hard drive, and open it locally (the whole site runs off local code, and running it locally guarantees that the addresses won't be seen by anyone else on the web). Generate some addresses and private keys, print those out on paper, and stash them someplace (keep one or two copies at home in a safe, maybe one somewhere in your car in case your house burns down or something, etc.). This way you have direct access to public and private keys for the addresses, so that even if the bitcoin wallet software gets updated, and your wallet.dat file is no longer compatible, you can still import your private key. Also, paper doesn't get digitally corrupted. And finally, this private key can be imported into any other wallet out there, not limiting you to just bitcoin-qt.

What happened with the price could be the result of a bubble popping, OR it could be the result of someone (pirate?) unloading a huge chunk of coins in an actually growing market. One could argue that the growth we've seen was due to actual economy improvements, such as SR sales, SatoshiDice gambling, increased activity on Bitcoin auction sites, capital flight in European nations, new markets for Bitcoin from BitInstant's "buy for cash activities," and just more speculators buying up in expectation of the December reward drop and September announcement, just as well as one could argue for this being a bubble. The Bitcoin economy wasn't sitting still this past 6 months.

Isn't it easier to just copy/paste the contract into a Bitcoin client that everyone's using already, anyway, and click "sign?" You can even write "payment will be made on this date to 1Address" and sign the contract with that same address, then when the payment is made, you can look at the address history and see that the contract is executed. Can't do that with a hash-generated address.

Think about how a company selling magazines or insurance works. Someone pays $12 for a year's subscription:
* Cash $12
* Unearned Revenue -$12
Magazine is sent out for the month:
* Unearned Revenue $1
* Income -$1
At the end of the period, you have a total amount if cash, part of which you have earned, or realized, and part of which is still a liability, not belonging to you, since if the customer cancels, you have to send the cash back.
That's the way I run Bitcoin100's accounts. People pledging are customers. Someone pledges (sends in) 10BTC, and wants 1BTC to go over charity (or 2, 5, or 10). That amount goes into Cash and Unearned Revenue. Right after that, 1BTC is taken from Unearned Revenue and put into the Income account, which is the money ready to be given to a charity. In this case, Cash is the total of all the money everyone sent in, and is the sum of Income, which is what's ready to be given, and Unearned Revenue, which is money sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the next charity. Once a charity is found, the entire Income account is expensed to whatever charity is picked, and each of the "customers" has a portion of their pledges transfered from Unearned into Income again. Hope that helps explain, and if you have suggestions on how to do this better, I'm all ears XP

I was considering using the following in my online business idea:
Buyer sends transaction to a 2-of-2 address, for which the buyer and the service hold private keys.
If buyer makes a sale, service signs with their key, and notifies the buyer who confirms and also signs. Same process for withdrawing.
If buyer commits to a sale, the service signs, but the buyer refuses to, the coins are locked until the service mediates with the buyer and seller.
If someone hacks the service and tries to steal the coins, or the service tries to run with the coins, they won't be able to, since they only have one of the two keys needed. There is still the issue of the service just disappearing, or losing copies of their private keys without a backup, in which case all the coins will simply be lost for ever.
If you can figure out how to code something like that, LET ME KNOW! I will be VERY interested in getting in touch with you.

Why is this on this subreddit? What does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2012-10-25 14:34:37
Well, the current # of bitcoins is 10,245,300, which with a market price of $11 comes out to total Bitcoin value of $112.7 million.
The estimated cost of a nuclear weapon on the black market is about $80mil.
If Iran uses Bitcoin to buy/sell one, it would add another $80mil to total Bitcoin value, bringing the price per BTC up to $18.5. So, if you hold any bitcoins while doing this, you'll make a profit of about 70% to 75% on them, plus whatever value increase from Iranians using them on the general market.
Hope this helps! :D

I think the difference here is that people bid on the interest rates they want to get, and MPOE only selects the rates they want of the amounts they need. I think the amount needed is based on how much capital they expect to need to cover their options/futures or whatever, meaning that they don't actually need to borrow to sustain the rest of their business. So in that sense, the rate going up isn't a reflection on how risky the investors think this deal or the company is, but how much MPOE itself believes it will be able to pay out in profits. So, it's not strictly a bond, but more of a profit-sharing,  interest-bearing savings... CD... or something... f*ck, I don't even know.

1. Miners are not billionaires.
2. Bitcoin IS real money. Any miner who believes in this has his billions in bitcoin, and would need to sell bitcoin to pay for electricity. Doesn't matter if those bitcoins are newly mined or from their personal stash.
@_date: 2012-02-23 00:49:03
There are hundreds of different miners, most of whom are running automated, unattended mining hardware, and there is no way to contact all of them easily. Theoretically, what you propose may be possible, with a result being a double spend, however, while the few miners who are aware of the reward can refuse to mine that transaction, there are hundreds of other miners who are just sitting, unattended, mining whatever is given to them, and who will quickly mine those ten blocks within an hour. I guess your attack would require 51% of the miners colluding as well.
(Also, there's no way to reward miners for NOT including transactions outside of sending them money directly)

If you have an ING checking account, you can transfer money directly to Bitfloor.com exchange to buy there.

Both methods are a pain, but are your cheapest options (other methods will charge 3% and up).
Localbitcoins.com is your fastest method, since that involves just trading cash for Bitcoin in person. BitInstant is your next easiest method, but you will pay a lot for convenience.

I forgot about dividends, though those are really rare and typically done by big established companies. Issuing dividends is also a signal that the company can't grow any more (nothing left to invest that pile of money into). So, basically, dividends are not a consideration for a newly formed business venture.


I completely agree that investors are stupid skiddish creatures, but aren't there two sides to the transaction? Selling equity increases your assets by equal amount of cash, so the value per stock shouldn't change, should it? It will decrease dividend per share, assuming there are ever dividends, though the extra equity could also expand the business and bring it more overall profit.
As for risk, yes, you increase your risk by selling more equity, but doesn't loading up on more debt by selling more bonds increase risk too? My previous post was under the assumption that more debt = more risk for the company, just as more equity = more risk, and likewise higher returns means higher risk, whether it's from risky equity of junk bonds.
Reading further, yes, companies issue bonds, but I remember that they are generally for at least a few grand if not hundred grand a piece (thus, bought by fewer people, typically those with more money). Smaller sizes I am guessing are too pricey due to economies of scale. Maybe that's different now with selling online. I don't buy bonds, so don't know what they're like now. And sure they are less risky, since they pay a smaller percentage, but there's no actual guarantee on the payment. Just an assumed one. Blue chip stocks are not very risky either, while junk bonds with high returns (and guarantee of payment) are also risky.
Putting the whole thing together, it seems that the general rule is, you give someone money, your return will depend on the risk, and it really doesn't matter if it's equity, bond, or IUO.


How many finance classes did you take?
BTW, I agree, debt is not evil (being stupid with your money is) In a big picture way of looking at it, giving someone else money is giving someone else money, whether it's buying stocks or bonds, and, as you said, it's all in the context of risk :)

I agree with spamming the block chain being a bad idea, but the messages are already in there, though they are put in by miners (Eligius puts bible references into mined blocks for example). This would likely mean that if you want to register an address with your identity on the blockchain, you would have to pay a pool to do it for you. I think that may be a plus: a paid for identity isn't as susceptible to sock farming (while you can create as many GPG sigs as you want for free), and identity accounts will be more likely to be valued.... Didn't even think about this until you brought it up. Thanks for the tip :D

There is a market for it, but everything you said is true and would be needed, including possibly on-site inspections. Problem is that would all cost a lot of money, which these small startups can't afford. I doubt any insurance would ever insure BTCST though.
EDIT: Checked the site. Interesting, though not sure I'd call that insurance exactly. Seems more like a betting site that let's people bet on whether something will fail or not. Insurance typically charges money and then uses that money to cover any claims. I guess here they offload the claim paying to the users, as well as any actual insurance work, like business/security auditing.

Adam, that's just getting desperate. No, SegWit is not a 2x increase. At the moment it's a 1.03x increase. The thing the community that you are now fighting against wanted was an immediately available increase, knowing it will take months to roll out (schedule a fork months in advance, and most users can benefit as soon as it comes out). SegWit was always a slow, gradual adoption option, which will probably grow not that much faster than HD wallet adoption did.
Hell, originally SegWit wasn't even as much about the transaction throughoutput increase, as it was about all the other great features SegWit will enable. Features that, I must say, most people don't even seem to know or care about anymore, with all the emphasis on it being just a "block increase."
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:15:46

Ah, so if there was a compromise agreement where SegWit was allowed if 2X was allowed, and 2X fork happened first, then the 2X fork would've been the compromise, and it would've been ok to not have SegWit?

Uh, 1 * (1+3%)^-100 is about 0.05, meaning a 95% drop in value over 100 years with 3% inflation. Inflation is generally a bit higher than 3% over long periods. So yeah, plenty enough for it to drop 97%, and that's not even taking into account possible hyperinflation due to rising debt, and due to influences of bitcoin itself.

But pay has been using this for many years (mandatory is recent), and is easy enough to reject a transaction: just send it back to the sending address, or refuse to process the payment and request that the person take the money back.

Core devs have been pretty resistant to ANY kind of "work together" for years, turning the organizatio into an exclusive dick-measuring group. But now that you're desperate, NOW you want to work together? 
If you want to beat 2X and keep Core in continued control of the blockchain, you can do one very simple step: change code in Core to accept 2MB blocks. That's it. I'm sure you're able to do that much more safely and skillfully than BTC1 and other alternative clients.

I would support this, and have started before that Core could easily kill this entire argument by simply reviewing and merging the 2mb code in the Core node too. But I doubt this will happen. First, I don't think miners and other businesses would trust Core's long term promises anymore, since they were betrayed before, and would expect Core to change their mind again in month 10 or so. And second, I doubt Core's egos would allow them to consider such a compromise, since they are all convinced they are 100% right and wouldn't even think of any compromises. So I expect we should just expect things to keep progressing as is through November.

Not for Tether, since that is actually being held and backed by regulated and audited banks. And while Locks isn't regulated now, they supposedly plan to switch Tether, which means they will be later as well.


Not "presumably," since the feds seized a few million of it.


Exchanges don't sell your fiat, so I don't even know why that's part of the list. Locks, from what I understand, allows option trading on the back end, so there is no fiat involved at all. Just enough bitcoin backing to cover any extreme swings in price.


Well, for one, because MtGox lost the contents of their **cold** wallet, which is supposed to be cold, i.e. offline. Plus they lost so little that it didnt affect them, showing proper contingency planning. And two, Coinapult is actually run by competent people with deep pockets and experience in bitcoin security, who have created a bunch of bitcoin businesses in the bast. MtGox was just created entirely by one guy, apparently using crappy code.

Technically, it has the processor power to encrypt a BIP38 wallet, but the way BIP38 encryption keeps you safe is by making it take a VERY long time to decrypt (and encrypt) the key, even with a simple password.

Backup feature worked perfectly fine for version 1.0, and those who installed version 1.1 as new. Only the upgrade locked the private keys away, which is why both send and backup don't work for those people (can't do either without private keys).

If all software companies are sucky, them we are at least as good as all software companies. We do design our stuff with the idea that we ourselves plan to hold a lot of our own money on our software and devices, and we do have goals of trying to male everything we do as decentralized and anonymous as possible. That's at last better than most other bitcoin software companies out there, I hope.
If "rolled your own security" is something that every company that writes security software does by default, then why did you bring that up? There is literally no other alternative then, since every security suite you use will have rolled its own security. But if you brought it up as a jab at us, to point at out incompetence, because as any security programmer know, you use the well developed tools already out there, then I'm correcting you by letting you know that we did use the tools already out there, as well as suggestions from very good (and very paranoid) security experts. We are not the best, we understand and readily admit that, and thus we do ask for outside help, and implement suggestions given to us. Hopefully that's at least enough.
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:18:06
FYI for anyone interested:
We found the problem with the app. Apparently when we submitted the 1.1 release to the AppStore, Apple decided to use a completely different security configuration file from the one we submitted (we still have no idea why). That caused the wallet apps to get locked out of the storage where private keys are held. This is why we didn't catch this "bug" in our code; it wasn't a bug in our code, it was something Apple screwed up.
As developers, Apple only allows us a few UDID-based development builds, and we used them up while trying to debug this issue. So now we can't create any more Crashlytics apps for people to recover coins right away even if we wanted to. 
We created a new app, version 1.2 (with some other updates), which should unlock everyone's coins. We have submitted it to Apple early last week, along with a note explaining that the issue they created caused our user funds to get locked up, and asking them to expedite their review process. They denied the expedite request, and put us in a normal review queue. So, not the app to fix everything is just sitting in limbo, waiting for Apple to review and approve it. We are hoping that will happen some time this week.
TL;DR Apple screwed us, didn't help with the fix, limited us in being able to help those affected, and is now delaying the fix even further. Screw Apple :(

TEE screen is displayed over the Android screen, and Android has no way to see what the screen is displaying. So, if the TEE process is launched, anything that Android tries to show to fake will just get covered up by true TEE. If the part that launches TEE is broken, and a fake TEE screen is shown, without TEE being launched the transaction can't be signed anyway, since the signing key is only stored inside TEE.

US wasn't interested in a regime change in Ukraine. Ukraine, unlike Russia for the last few years, was a EU, and thus US, ally. Its citizens and most of its past presidents were pro-US. Even more damning to this theory is the fact that Ukraine has recently discovered vast reserves of shale gas, which a bunch of international companies, including US ones, were just starting to develop with Ukraine's blessing. Turning that country into chaos would be like US establishing oil fields in middle east, and then blowing up its own oil fields. Why would it do that?
I know people who were protesting on Maidan, and who live in Kiev and rest of Ukraine who supported the protest. Their ONLY reason was because Yanukovich was changing the constitution and trying to set himself up as a permanent dictator. They would have protested with or without US involvement.


Just in one state. Bitcoin isn't even just American. And US bans on bitcoin would be as effective as already existing US bans on illegal file downloading.


That is blatantly false. Russia attacked Ukraine, Romania, Georgia, Lithuania, Poland, Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, Afghanistan, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Chechnya, Finland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czech republic, Zimbabwe, Angola, Somalia, Mozambique, Syria, Salvador, Nicaragua, Chile, Dominique, Venezuela, and many others. Many of those it attacked the same way it did with Ukraine, by sending in its own instigators to start chaos, then when the population freaks out, pretend that it's the country's government attacking its own people, and then send in weapons and soldiers to "protect" the people from government, followed by either full invasion, or secret support, resulting in a takeover of government. Whom do you think USA was fighting in Vietnam, Korea, Syria, Afghanistan, and South American countries?


Just $600 billion debt, and no way to repay it because the debt is in USD, and Russian ruble crashed badly. Good luck to Russia with restructuring to be less dependent on oil. About 75% of its income comes from oil, and it doesn't have much of an economy otherwise. What's worse is that anyone with any brains leaves there as soon as they can, so they don't have any smart people to set up businesses. And corruption is so rampant that anyone who isn't smart can't even set up a business either. As for China, China knows who its friends are: It's the people with the money to buy Chinese stuff. China is currently angry at Russia, because China has been trying to hold onto territories that want to become separate (Tibet, etc), and Russia, a supposed communist ally, just showed Chinese people that if some group wants to separate, they should be able to. How is China supposed to explain it to its citizens?


Probably because the separatists ARE nazi terrorists. At least Ukraine only blocks bank accounts if you send money to terrorists. Russia is trying to ban bitcoin completely.


Which is great. You love EU?


I thought USA spent $5 billion to change regime in Ukraine? Does US care or not?

Honestly, the checksum thing was not the security we were focusing on. An extremely dedicated attacker could just make the device dump whatever checksums you would expect, while still running malicious code. No, we didnt roll our own security solution. We implemented internal checks and signatures that work without user input, and added protections to keep attackers out, many of which were suggested to us and helped with implementation by other people. We didnt expect users to check the checksum signatures on the devices to this extent, but since they are, we're writing a specific app to help them verify those more easily without confusion like this. Sorry its not out yet (may be done by this weekend).
If you doubt our security, the source code and schematics are up on github. Have at it.

Sorry, I didn't mean to sound mean. Please forgive me. I had an issue where I sent some coins somewhere and got screwed because the address wasn't created right or something (way back in 2011). Have been making backups prior to using wallets ever since. And although we keep thinking it would save users if we forced them to back up first, we're worried they'll write the seed on a bar napkin somewhere, lose it, and won't create any more backups.
At the least, I hope this will be a good lesson to our users.

Well, since ancaps are mostly INTJ, INTP, and ENTJ, they do sorta have a right to claim intellectual superiority. Those types are usually quite intellectual. I don't think An-anything believes that society **should** do anything though. You're thinking statists there. AnCaps just think that their way is best, and hope to change society by providing tools and incentives that will lead it in that direction. Kinda like how BitTorrent led society to ignore copyright rules on music and movies, and 3D printing may lead society to ignore trademark rules on toys or bans on guns.

That was sent over many decades, since 1991, not in just the last year. It was just foreign aid, same as US sends to Israel and Russia, not a single chunk of money to destabilize.


USA can't destroy bitcoin. That's the point of bitcoin.


It's the same in Russia. Russia economy is dying, so it needs war to distract Russians, and to sell weapons to foreign countries.


Bitcoin is doing fine in Ukraine. It is not banned, there is a bitcoin embassy in Kiev, and they have 4,000+ ATMs that let you buy bitcoin. The reason Russia is banning bitcoin is because Russian economy is failing and they have currency controls preventing people from moving money out of the country. Bitcoin allows people to bypass those currency controls. USA did not make Russia set up totalitarian laws banning their own citizens from freely using their money.

Yes, by invading and destabilizing a county, because NATO rules prohibit any country from joining if it's borders are in dispute. It's the same thing that they did in Romania and Georgia, who also wanted to join NATO, and which still have disputed violent borders with Russian funded separatists. It's also why Russia is refusing to annex parts of Eastern Ukraine, despite those areas also having high votes for wanting to join Russia. And why is it any of Russia's business if an independent country wants to join NATO? You guys are so against US invading and starting wars with countries if it doesn't like their politics.why is it ok then for Russia? Also, why didn't Russia just join NATO too, instead of being an isolationist bully?


Look it up. The questions were "Join Russia" or "Restore 1992 Constitution," which is the one where Crimea declared itself an independent state, in which case it would fall under the protection (i.e. control of) Russia. The options were be Russia, or be under Russia. Stay with Ukraine wasn't on the ballot. The actual reported outcome was 96.77% for joining Russia. I think the reason they didnt do 100% was because while a 96.77% result is obviously fake but can be pushed as high support by propaganda, a 100% result would be unquestionably fake that no one would believe.

Basically, Buttcoin started on SomethingAwful, the same guys who have been tormenting furries, bronies, and anything else out of the ordinary for over a decade now, who have latched on to Bitcoin way back in 2010/2011 when it was just starting out, claiming that it was a completely stupid and ridiculous idea. As time went on, and Bitcoin kept growing, a bunch of them were getting more and more frustrated due to being proven more and more wrong (and seeing people who didn't think it was stupid have their bitcoins grow hugely in value). That in some weird way led them to DOXing some bitcoiner, their SA thread being shut down by mods, they opened another thread, which also got shut down for being too obnoxious, so now they just have a subreddit. Haters gotta hate somewhere.

Bank currencies create their own issues, mainly by distorting the actual demand for goods in the market. Price is used to determine demand. If banks manipulate currencies, they manipulate demand. And then sellers and buyers can't be sure whether their items are changing in price due to changing market conditions, or due to bank currency manipulation. Worse, those increases and decreases in currencies are usually done by changing interest rates. Interest on a loan is literally the price of risk. If that price goes down, people think there is less risk than there really is. And that's how things like housing bubbles happen.
Regarding rising bitcoin prices, the seller will have to keep lowering his prices in terms of bitcoin, simply because otherwise his goods will look like they are getting more and more expensive (with bitcoin getting more expensive), but the seller will actually be BETTER off, not worse, since as soon as he gets paid in bitcoin, the value of that bitcoin will go up. Keep in mind that the price of the item in bitcoin is going down only relative to the price in fiat. So selling for fiat vs selling for bitcoin won't make any difference, since the value of each will be the same. Only the number will be different, and the following change in value once it's in your hand (constant slow decline for fiat, growth for bitcoin)

It's still more secure, and way simpler, than the common method of downloading bitaddress.org, disconnecting your PC or booting into some offline Linux, printing out a paper wallet through a directly connected printer, and hoping nothing was stored in cache. Eventually, unless you import this into a Trezor or an always-offline PC, you'll have to import this key into some device, which may or may not be infected. This doesn't guarantee 100% complete security in all cases. Nothing can. But it is much easier and more secure than alternatives. We shouldn't forgo little steps to make things easier and more secure, just because they are not perfect, since we'll be waiting for ever for the perfect solution.

For buying and selling, LocalTrader (built into Mycelium) and LocalBitcoins.com may be your best options. As for keeping your coins safe, back up your 12 word seed and store it safely somewhere, then encrypt your phone, and set up a PIN in your Mycelium wallet. That should at least keep you safe for small amounts of money (a few bitcoins at most).

Extra confidence, but a mistake on our part most likely. As you know (and Cascacius coin stickers have shown), stickers aren't a very reliable form of security either. You brought up infinitely regressive security concerns, I just pointed out that if we go all the way, nothing is really safe. At some point you have to trust someone.

Yep. Everything is modifiable, both in hardware and in software. And users are allowed to write their own firmware and flash it, though they would need to provide their own different signature. That's what the precaution is about. If you modify it and screw it up, then lose your coins, and then flash it back to factory and claim it was out fault, we don't want to be sued for it.
You don't have to trust it. That's your prerogative. I do wonder what would make you trust it though? Any device can be opened, chips replaced, software modified, and stickers reapplied in tact after having been removed with solvent. So where do you draw the trust line?

 What has happened
On March 31 we released version 1.1 of Mycelium wallet for iOS. It had many useful improvements, including support for system passcode and Touch ID.
Within the first day a few customers complained that they can not perform payments. Re-installing the wallet and restoring it from backup helped resolve the issue. On the second day we received a few more complaints, some of them stating that a backup was never made, so they cannot simply re-install the wallet.
To limit potential losses, we immediately pulled the app from the App Store to prevent remaining users from automatically updating until we investigate and resolve the problem.
Immediate analysis showed that only a few of our users has experienced this problem. Additional testing did not show if there is a bug in the application that could have lead to the lock out of funds. We also could not reproduce the issue where updating from v1.0 to v1.1 makes payments impossible on any of our own systems.
We began collecting reports from customers with various details of their iPhone setup, and reached out to several customers to perform additional diagnostics on their devices. While investigating the issue, we learned that several other iOS developers reported a similar intermittent issue with a security component known as "Keychain": the operating system simply locks the application out of the secret data being stored by it. We could not yet find a concrete explanation on how that's possible and what is the best workaround for it (e.g. 
The investigation is ongoing, but in the meanwhile we have implemented mitigation methods to reduce the impact of the issue. We are still testing it and very soon will resubmit the app to the App Store.
 Next steps
1. If you have a previous verson (1.0) installed, please make sure you have made a back up. It can be done in Settings tab -&gt; Export Wallet Master Key. You will be shown a list of words: write them down and re-enter to make sure you did not make a mistake.
2. If you have the latest version (1.1) installed and it works fine for you, still make sure you have a backup as described above.
3. If you cannot send money and you have made a backup, please make sure your back up is still accessible. When the update comes out, you will be able to simply re-install the app, enter your backup words, and use it normally.
4. If you have not made a backup, but have not deposited any funds into your wallet, you may simply re-install and create a new wallet when the update comes out (do not send any coins to your wallet in the meantime).
5. If you cannot send money and you **have not** saved the backup, we will have a manual diagnostic process to help you. Please contact us (see the details below). **Do not delete the Mycelium Wallet and do not deposit more bitcoins into it**
The updated app will take several days or even a week to appear after the problem is identified and solved due to the App Store validation process.
If you have made a backup and you need to access your funds sooner, you may use the Android Mycelium Wallet and restore your backup there.
 Manual diagnostic process
We ask every customer who can't access their coins and who **has not made a backup** to contact us by email at ios The process is tedious, so if you have a backup, please wait for the update to come out, or use the Android Mycelium Wallet to access the funds from your backup.
If you do not have the backup, please send us an email with the following information:
1. Your device identifier (UDID, see below on how to find it).
2. Your contact email.
Note 1: Do not delete the existing installation of your wallet! If you do, you will irrevocably lose all the information that may help with recovering your funds.
Note 2: We do not want, nor need your personal identifying information. If you have privacy concerns, please use a temporary email address and Tor if needed. Just make sure the email address you provide will work for a few days so we can contact you back.
Note 3: Your device identifier is only necessary for us to be able to make a diagnostic build of the app for your device. Apple's app signing process requires that. Since 2013, no application (including Mycelium) has access to that identifier, so it's not possible to use it to track any of your activity on your iPhone. It's only good for installing builds during development outside the AppStore. See below for more information. If you are still concerned about privacy implications, you may wait for an AppStore-based build to come out and use that for diagnostic process.
We will send you back a diagnostic build of Mycelium Wallet and further instructions.
Thankfully not many people are affected, and we will work as fast as we can, but this could still take a few days to resolve. We will try to be very careful in order to successfully recover your funds. We hope you understand.
 How to find your device identifier (UDID)
- Connect your iPhone to a Mac or PC with iTunes.
- Select your iPhone in iTunes. You may need to unlock it first (enter passcode or TouchID).
- Open the Summary tab for that iPhone (the very first one).
- Click the label "Serial Number: X7TG14Y1ESK7" until it starts showing "UDID: d87437b0310078e50ced34739b3b54f89b69ac07" (your numbers will be different). The label does not look like a button, but it's clickable.
- Right-click the UDID and copy it.
- Include that UDID in the email to us.

The iOS bug wasn't entirely our fault. The app was tested extensively, and we STILL can't replicate the problem that caused issues, with all out phones working perfectly fine with it. We are trying to get people who had iOS issues to create dumps of their app to see what happened. Our best guess is that for some reason the TouchID library in iOS (which is badly documented to begin with) may be locking up because Apple signed the wallet app using their own signature, and that signature is different from the prior app signature, causing TouchID to freak out and lock up the keys. That's our best guess so far. Android makes this so much easier to deal with :(

USA had nothing to do with what happened in Ukraine, nor with what's happening here. Both were the result of Russian dictatorship-style government, first trying to distract their populace from their failed economy and failing government by starting a war, and after the currency crashed and economy continued to collapse, now trying to keep people from being able to use bitcoin to circumvent their strict currency controls. This is a sign of a failing country, just like Argentina, Cyprus, and Greece, nothing more.

Myers-Briggs isn't "flattering." And although it's not considered the scientific standard in psychology, it's the most widespread and closest approximation used.

That issue only popped up on very few phones for whatever reason, not on all of them, which is why it was missed during testing ,and we still can't reproduce the issue on our own hardware, but we had a lot of submissions and help from our users to troubleshoot it. We took the app down because we didn't want other random people losing money.
@_date: 2015-04-03 04:00:56
Honestly, I don't suggest it on iPhone yet myself :P
We are constantly in a debate over whether to allow users to use the app before they make a backup. On the one hand, it would avoid problems from situations like these, on the other, it may force people to either not use the app at all, or to write down their seed on some bar napkin that they will lose soon after. So we have settled on allowing people to use it, but keep pestering them about making a backup.

It was going to be ready and start mass production a few months ago, but we found that when we flex this thing too much (remember, the circuit board, display, and battery are all flexible), the gold leads going from the CPU to the board can cross and short. So we had to flip the CPU over, which means changing the circuit board schematics, ordering new test devices, and doing more testing. I think we should have the new test units in the office early this summer. In the mean time, we are continuing to improve the UI a bit, and even received a grant to help us with that. Once the test devices and received and thoroughly tested (our CEO carries one everywhere, even to the beach), we'll have a production order run. That probably won't be until Fall, and, as Tralsa said, the final release will probably be closer to the end of the year (it's surprising how much a hardware issue can delay a project).

no, I don't. You can't predict which way the price goes, and thus it's pointless to wish I could've done things differently. At the time there was just as much chance the price was going to go up as down, and had I sold, I would've risked losing out on the growth too.

Don't forget that inflation is also relative to the price. At $10 per BTC inflation is adding $72,000 worth of bitcoin a day, meaning someone has to buy $72k worth for it to stay at $10. Now that it's at $2.50, only $18k needs to enter the market. If it drops to $1 per, only $7.2k will be needed. I don't know how much money actually enters the exchanges every day, but MtGox alone usually has 70k worth of BTC traded daily.

Dwolla had major issues/changes and it locked up money being transferred into MtGox. I've been waiting to transfer a few $k myself since Wednesday, and some said they've been waiting longer than that. Not being able to buy = price goes down.

I personally like this method the most:
I didn't even know about the -datadir=E:\Bitcoin option. 
I'm also rather concerned now after heading about that theft, so will be doing the secured/encrypted directory thing, and only keep bitcoin running when I need to send a payment. I also do backups every time I get paid, which I encrypt with a password and store on a USB stick and online (USB stick goes into my home safe). The only way someone can steal my money is if they got a keyloger on my PC and got my password. I guess if my money grows large enough, I'll use the netbook stored in a safe option.

I wouldn't say superior, since parts of TEE are still closed source, but aside from that, the security is the same as if you were to ducttape a Trezor to the back of your phone.

You can flash your own custom firmware. You would need to provide your own signature in the settings.txt file, and bypass the warning during the flash. If the signature in the settings file doesn't match, it won't flash. So, yes, it's modifiable. And still secure. Just check the signature in the settings file. If it doesn't match ours, change it and flash our firmware instead.

Biggest obstacle to this will likely me the small volume on the local BTC exchanges trading BTC for local currency. I.E. if you receive some BTC from abroad and need to convert it to your local currency, say 3RD, so you can actually use the money to buy local goods, you have to have someone on the exchange trying to sell their 3RD for BTC to.. I don't know, buy stuff from, or send money to, abroad, too?
Money has to circulate around within a country, trading BTC for local currency and back, and with too low a volume, the exchange rate for 3RD for BTC will get lower and lower (possible arbitrage opportunity maybe...)

Well, excuse us for having to find and fix Apple's problem. Our code was perfectly fine, and there were no bugs in it. Our dev only figured out what was wrong by some freak inspiration of genius, realizing that Maybe Apple fucked up the security configurations file when they put it up on their AppStore, using one that WASN'T the one we submitted it with. And now we are waiting for Apple to approve the app we already submitted, and we just got an email from them that despite the problem being their fault, and our customers are locked out of their money, they WON'T bother expediting our approval request.

The bug wasn't device specific. There was no bug in the code.

Second point is pretty much what I posted a month ago (6/8) and Falkvinge acknowledged:
The second biggest claim I keep hearing against Bitcoin is that “it mainly benefits early adopters.” I guess the claim is that, since people who got into it early will have all the money, newcomers will want to stay out of the system, and that will lead it to failure. What this claim fails to take into account is that those people who got in early, and now have a lot of wealth, have an incredibly high incentive to see this system succeed. They will very likely use their wealth to invest in improved financial service companies, design easier ways to transact with Bitcoin, and make the system more prevalent and user friendly in general. In a way, early adopters who have taken on enormous risks on the hopes that this currency goes anywhere, will be paid by the currency itself to make sure that it succeeds. An excellent example of this is the largest Bitcoin currency exchange site MtGox. At present volume, they already make an estimated $30,000+ a day in revenues, and the owners have pledged to use the money to continue to expand and improve the system, and to create a lobby to defend Bitcoin in governments. At $14,000,000 a year that is expected to only grow, that is a pretty nice chunk of cash to run a lobby with.

Nothing important, I assure you. The reason this wasn't "immediately obvious" was because, as I mentioned elsewhere, this wasn't the main security method we internally relied, or even planned on, nor one that we assumed our users would bother with. There are internal signatures in the device itself, which you can see in the settings.txt file. We figured users would rely on those, not the website firmware and sig.
We only ended up putting up the firmware on our site, along with the signature, after a bunch of stickers were torn off, and users were concerned about device tampering during shipping, for which we recommended reflashing the units with our original firmware just to make sure the units are back to their original condition (which would only work if the signature in the settings.txt was correct). So if it wasn't for the shipping issues, this whole thing wouldn't have been an issue to begin with, and users would have simply relied on the signature in the settings.txt file, and those who were a bit more security conscious would have just added their own salt to the devices as well. And if you are completely paranoid, you can still download the open source code from our github, verify all the code, build your own firmware from that, and flash that. Or even build your own device from scratch from our schematics. Basically we covered our bases from the casual user, all the way to the super paranoid tinfoil hat types.

I think on the contrary speculators will jump in now. They've seen that people value the currency, and that it has sustained a healthy trend at $20 to $24, so buying it at $12 now is almost a guaranteed positive short-term  return.
Besides, speculators and day traders don't really hurt the market. Day traders keep it liquid (they're there to buy and sell when the market needs it), and speculators keep the price up, and keep their own interests of making their investments successful going.

DEFINITELY Bitcoin. With that amount of money, security starts to get REALLY expensive, and it's way cheaper to secure and back up your Bitcoin than to securely store gold. Heck, I don't even have to pay anything to secure and back up that much BTC, whereas with gold I'd likely have to either pay a bank to store it for me, or increase my home insurance to protect me from theft.
As for liquidity, I really don't need to spend all $20mil NOW, so I'm not worried about it. Being able to dump $5,000 a day on MtGox, which does about $500,000 worth of trades daily, is plenty of money to play with.

We will avoid showing any addresses unless we have to, until we implement shortened stealth addresses.
But in this case, the issue isn't merging. It's if A pays to B and C, and C pays to D and E, and I know that A and E belongs to the same person, I know that C belongs to them too. Imagine a long string, with transactions peeling off of it bit by bit.

STEM can be useless BS depending on the degree. If your degrees are in something like chemistry, architecture, geology, engineering, physics, math, or anything unrelated to crypto, it's useless for understanding bitcoin. And crypto/IT is only part of it. You need to understand finance, econ, or business to understand the rest of it. I have over a decade of programming experience, and a master's in business finance and econ. Plus I was doing doctorate-level STEM stuff (electromechanical engineering) since high school, so who cares. So I suspect your understanding of bitcoin itself is bullshit.

First, when Ukraine had it's own thing going on with Yanukovich being outsted for trying to become a dictator, Russia, who didn't have ANY business in any of it, started a massive propaganda campaign, scaring everyone into believing that Ukraine government is being taken over by nazis (far-right party got less than 3% of the vote). Then when Yanukovich didn't have the guts to shoot his own people, Russia used its own snipers to shoot at protesters. Snipers who were later recognized to be fighting in the east as part of Russian military. Russia sent troops and criminals as instigators to eastern Ukraine and even as far as Odessa to "protest" the government and get people riled up by spreading lies about how Ukraine will ban Russian language, make anyone who doesn't speak Ukrainian a second class citizen, and about how the government will become fascist. Then when the fighting with separatists started, Russia sent in their own troops, weapons, tanks, grad launchers, and other military hardware to fight Ukraine. The small band of separatists was quickly losing, until Russia came in with overwhelming force. So, the tactic was: send in instigators pretending as if government is oppressing its own people, have those instigators kill or blow up some things, blame it on government, sent in Russian troops to "protect" the people. It's the EXACT SAME tactic that Russia used in Georgia, Romania, and decades ago in Afghanistan, Cuba, North Africa, and tons of other countries.

Unless USA is actually hostile towards Russia, that does not matter. Russia was considered an ally and a trading partner until Putin. Also, don't forget that a lot of the countries where US has bases actually **want** those US bases, and are even paying US to have them there (like Japan for example). It saves them money on having to pay for their own base and military.


Blame that on Russia. Note that those countries used to all be a part of USSR at some point. Russia, and russians, feel like those countries should still belong to Russia, so they send in instigators, start protests and civil wars, and then send in Russian troops under the guise of "We want to protect our Russian people." It's what they just did in Ukraine, and is the same thing they did in Georgia, Romania, and as USSR to many other countries, even those far away, like Cuba, Afghanistan, North Africa, and countries in South America (though takeovers there failed, because russian instigators were simply shot and killed). Here's a video of how it went down in Georgia not too long ago 


What does US and US generals have to do with Russian aggression against Ukraine? And of course Russian generals would not say anything similar about Russia. You forget that US has freedom of speech, but Russia does not. If you say something like that, you will be jailed or killed.

Hardware schematics are online on our repo, so you can open the device and check, although whoever replaced it will probably use similar chips. So just add your own salt in the settings file, verify the hash when it prints the wallet to make sure that the salt is used correctly, and whatever they compromised or replaced is useless, with your wallets being secure again. We did assume the worst case scenario when making these.

It was also inflation. Post WWI Germany had a very weak government, and the guy in charge of the central bank was literally under threat of being killed by special interests if he didn't print money and send it out in pallets. That led to hyperinflation, Jews were still bankers (because banking is a sin in old christian faith and it was often the only job allowed for Jews), so they made what seemed an unfair amount of money on loans during inflation (buy a house for 30 years, pay it off with one month's amount), and the angry populace wanted a **STRONG** government that would not be swayed by some special interests, would not answer to anyone, and would punish those Jew bankers that supposedly cause the problem (even though it was all central bank head's fault). The strongest choice was Hitler. So, ever since then, in Germans' minds  inflations cause Hitlers. It's why Germany was so reluctant to inflate and QE even despite Greece's problems (source: Harvard Business School's World Economic History class case paper on Weimar Republic and the rise of Hitler)

Hey, guys, calm down, I am the Mycelium Community Manager, I am Mycelium's US counterpart, and I live in Catonsville. I received 500+ of these devices from our main office in Austria (not Sweden), and then it was my job to individually box and ship them all to all our customers in North and South Americas (including Canada). So there was no nefarious redirection here (yes, I know NSA headquarters are a drive away for me, I pass them on my way to Bitcoin Meetups in DC).
One of the biggest reasons for the delay in getting these devices made was a lot of feedback from people as, or even more, paranoid than you guys. So because of them we added a whole lot of extra security features, contingency options, stronger RF resistant cases, and software security options. Hardware tampering with devices is technically possible, but not easy, and especially not cheap. Flashing firmware requires that the firmware is signed, and the signature matches the signature in the settings file. Screwing with firmware to install malware or compromise security is of course possible (everything's possible), but is super difficult. And then, even if they succeed, if you add your own Diceware salt to the device in the settings file, it will combine your salt with its internal entropy source, and create a wallet with a hash you can use to 100% verify to include your salt. Basically, just adding salt will make all of the expensive and supper difficult hardware and software tampering completely useless. Boxes, packaging, and hologram seals were the least important security features we included (I'm now thinking it may have been a mistake to include them in the first place, since it seems to have just freaked out a lot of people unnecessarily). All the security comes in the tons of work we did on the software and hardware side. We created these with the assumption that NSA/CIA should be able to borrow it from you, and then when you get it back, for you to still feel safe storing millions of dollars on paper wallets it creates (as long as you reflash it with a signed firmware file, and add your own salt).
@_date: 2015-03-18 14:45:21
Multisig would be tough, since all the Sig keys would have to be printed on the same sheet all at once, making the Entropy itself be the single point of failure. For multisig, it's better to just use single address keys, and use multisig compatible wallets to create multisig addresses from those keys.
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:02:39

Chainalysis goes beyond just that, attempting to track bitcoin transactions as they go through the blockchain.

We don't think it's worth any specific amount right now. The $100mil example was just an example, because it's easier to work with round numbers.
New wallet has about 5,000 man-hours. Old wallet has between 15,000 and 20,000 man-hours. There were times when the old wallet had only two people supporting and developing it, due to lack of funding. The new wallet has a larger team working on it already.


Just another example using round numbers. We plan to hire a UI developer and two more core developers, one Android and one iOS. We plan to have the wallet done by end of the year, so that would mean about 10,000 more man-hours.


Not much, since their core services are not unique in any way (there are a whole lot of other block explorers and much better wallets), their only potential source of revenue is advertising and maybe fees on services like mixing (but we will have our own actually working CoinShuffle out soon), and, most importantly, they have absolutely no network effect or customer lock-in with their business. So I wouldn't even consider investing in them (and didn't). Our core component is a central market where businesses can offer users services through our platform. Users will use our wallet because it will be the one with the most plugins, and businesses and plugin developers will develop for our wallet because it will have the most users. Moreover, if users buy certain plugins, they will be less tempted to abandon them for something else. Right now there is nothing keeping me switching from blockchain.info (which I also use) to something else. But I can't switch from Google Play, because all my purchased apps are there, and I prefer Google Play to Amazon app store, because the later barely has anything there compared to the former. And that's the same business model we are pursuing.

The sole reason for the overthrow was because Yanukovich was elected to help make Ukraine independent, and with the hopes that it will join with Europe, but Yanukovich renegged on his promises, turned out to be Putin's puppet, stole 70 billion that was given to Ukraine to help rebuild, and tried to change the constitution to give himself dictator-like powers.That is the only reason anyone I know who was at the Maidan protests was protesting. All of that was proven later, when Yanukovich made protesting an automatic 15 year jail sentence, then escaped to Putin when he was outsted, and this was discovered when it was left unattended, built with Ukrainians' money without them knowing about it 


Yes, there are. There are neonazi elements in many governments around Europe. But the claims made by Russia that they were in control of Ukrainian government were completely false. Russia was even busted for trying to rig Ukrainian elections, where they inserted a virus into voting software that would make Right Sector Dmytro Yarosh the winner by 37 points. Ukrainian inteligence discovered the virus, removed it, and didn't tell anyone, and Russia actually got caught reporting that Dmytro Yarosh was winning by the exact percent that was programmed into the virus.
( 
 In the end, neo-nazis only got less than 3% of the vote, and Poroshenko is considered a vote in opposition to nazis. On the other hand, Russia is still considered to have [half of the world's neo-nazi population]( Not just more than any other country, but half of all of the whole world. It's a very common tactic in Russia (and now US) to distract people from a problem in their country, by pointing it out in another.


Sure, some Ukrainian police were shot, but the people shooting protesters weren't Ukrainian, they were Russian special forces  Some of them were later recognized as fighting in Eastern Ukraine alongside other Russian soldiers "on vacation" there.


On the contrary, there were two reasons for Russia to want chaos in Ukraine. First, as I mentioned, enormous shale gas reserves were discovered in Eastern Ukraine two years ago, and a multitude of global energy companies were working on setting up to mine it. This would have broken Russia's monopoly on gas to Europe. And second, even more importantly, the EU charter forbids any country to join EU if its borders are in dispute. Russia didn't want NATO on it's borders, so it wants chaos in Ukraine. It's the same reason they attacked Georgia and Romania/Moldova, creating chaos on their borders and preventing them from applying to join NATO/EU.




What part is news? Claims that Ukraine will ban Russian language? Russia sending instigators into Ukraine? Or Russian troops fighting in Ukraine almost since the beginning?


I don't want US getting involved in war. There is no need for it. Russian economy is on the brink of collapse, and sanctions are doing more than enough. I just want people to stop spreading lies about what is really going on with Ukraine, and be aware that this isn't a "USA trying to start a war with Russia via Ukraine" thing, but a "Russia has invaded and is attacking another country, while blaming America for it" thing. USA is not the enemy, it isn't even involved. And Russia is not a victim, it's the aggressor in this.


I have not seen anything at all in the media about US trying to prepare American population for war with Russia. Everything I hear and read from the politicians is basically apathy. The only media that seems to be making claims that USA wants to attack Russia is coming out of Russia itself. Much in the same way that the news about terrorists wanting to attack US mainly comes out of US itself.


What Russia has and is doing in Ukraine is really ugly, and the propaganda and lies are really bad too. Are you sure it's not being downvoted because they are ugly lies?


I'm not sure the politicians want global domination. Honestly, they're not that smart for it. Also, what possible strategic purpose does Ukraine provide? Why not Turkey or Kazakhstan? Or Latvia,  Estonia, or Finland (all of which have had their airspace violated by Russian military planes running bombing exercises)?


Possibly. Though keep in mind, just 5 or 8 years ago, Russia was considered a peaceful ally by Europe and US. What changed?


Ideally I want everyone in the world to decide this. But I want people to actually decide, not have that decision forced on them, regardless of whether it's by Ukrainian military, or Russian-backed separatist warlords.

Gear uses xpubs to generate addresses, so the funds go directly into the wallet of whoever set it up. They don't go through an intermediary like with BitPay or Coinbase. It's basically like pasting your bitcoin address online, but Gear takes care of generating new addresses for you from your public HD key. So if Naked Heart added that widget to their website, they are the ones who provided their bitcoin address and are getting the bitcoins. Mycelium is not involved in the transaction at all. Our company policy is that we never hold anyone's funds, and thus have no way of stealing or being liable for them. You don't have to trust us.

Freicoin is just a dumb idea, with really crappy and confusing marketing and reasoning (ever talk to the creator?), so I wouldn't count that as a good example. We have yet to see where Ether goes, since that will be deflationary, supposedly, when it comes out.
Also, don't forget that light wallets enforce rules too. Nodes can't force transactions on people if their wallets don't accept them. Plus with transaction pruning and various other optimizations, it may be easier to run a node for anyone later (one that verifies and passes along transactions). Add Justus Ranvier's suggestion for being able to pay to run nodes and broadcast transactions, making nodes actually profitable, and it may be something that anyone with some business savvy can run.

This suggests that the reasons for the overthrow were not the reasons that the actual protesters that demanded his ouster had. Was US responsible for planning the overthrow, or did it step in when it was obvious that Yanukovich was going to start attacking his own people, only as a push to finally get him out?


Russia had plans on building another pipeline through Turkey, which it's working on now. And instability with a weakened government that doesn't have the army to protest is MUCH more preferable to losing Europe as a customer completely to a nation that will get much wealthier from its own gas.


Drop in oil prices wasn't predicted, so not sure why that's relevant.


I don't mean people in US, I mean the politicians and the president. They all seem like they don't care, and are reluctant to do anything. I'm sure there are elements shaping US opinion. There are obviously also elements trying to shape general opinion of Russia's position. But don't forget, Russia is MUCH better at it than US ever was. It basically ran a nonstop propaganda campaign for a century, while US had at least some semblance of a free press. That's why the most reliable sources I know of are the actual people who live there, who tell me about the worries they have, what they are having trouble getting because of the war or economy, what they see happening around them, etc.


That's pretty much it right there. Only thing is that it was Ukraine that wanted to join western powers, not that western powers were trying to force Ukraine to join them.
As for propaganda campaign against Russia, I know sometimes it seems extreme and over the top, but Russia IS actually as bad as a lot of the western media makes it out to be. Much of it hasn't really changed from the old USSR days, and many of its leaders are still the same KGB. I'm sure you're heard about the billions Putin and his oligarchs have stolen from the people, about the many assassinated reporters and bloggers, about how Russia owns or controls most of the media there, including RT. Have you seen this video btw?  This is about Russia's attack on Georgia in 2008. It's not that much different from what happened in Ukraine.

Examples of lax security were relying on just the SRAM source of entropy (we added two more sources), just on the hardware which may get compromised (we added salt option), rf interference (we switched from plastic to metal cases), and flashing any firmware file (we changed it so it only accept properly signed firmware, with a separate internal check), among other minor fixes. Luckily for us, we didn't have to hire those people; they volunteered their services and suggestions for free (we have a wonderful bitcoin community that looks out for each other). For the most part, this consisted of many examples of how they may try to attack these devices, and either suggestions for, or confirmation of our ideas, for how to block those attacks. When you develop something, you often end up so focused and limited on your conceptualization of that thing that you can't think outside of it, and can't think up of crazy out-of-the-box attack scenarios, so having another set of outside eyes and brains look into it is a major benefit. Just like when you write a document, it often takes a third party to proofread it to find mistakes.

You mean the peace deal that was only meant to keep Ukrainian army from fighting, but which separatists ignored and kept shelling towns? And why would Putin push for a peace deal if he started the thing, and has the military power to do whatever he wants? Big man...


Yeah, not too far south of where my friend's family lives. Thanks for the info.


Probably because separatists have never honored any peace deals and kept firing.


Who is telling you this? There's maybe one or two senators who are pushing for it, and everyone else is ignoring them. Almost all of the senators don't want any war with Russia. They are too focused on the Middle East.


Are you Russian? Do you write for Pravda? Because that is the ONLY way that "I don't want Russia waging war on Ukraine" can be turned to mean "I want to wage war on Russia."

Antiwar painted separatists as the victims, and US as a willing participant. Neither is true. US has been asked to provide experienced help in government and economics after their government was taken out, and has been dragging its feet on providing ANY military or defensive support to Ukraine. Much of their military support actually comes from personal private donations with people sending money for things like uniforms, armored vests, and helmets. Separatists, on the other hand, have been attempting to set up warlord style military dictatorships in the area, and receiving massive support from Russia, which has a clear personal interest in keeping that area in chaos, since about 2 years ago massive shale gas reserves were found in South-east Ukraine, which would have broken Russia's monopoly on gas to Europe.

There's actually no guarantee that it will work. Android has a REALLY bad bug where if you try to connect through Tor, and the connection fails, Android will silently switch you to a clearnet connection to continue to connect, without even letting you know. We fixed that issue by adding Mycelium nodes on .onion hidden services. That way, our wallet tries to connect through Tor to a .onion address, and it either connects, or completely fails, since clearnet can't connect to .onion at all. So your only option to guarantee you are anonymous on Tor is to force your wallet to connect to a Tor hidden service. As far as I know, Electrum is the only other wallet that runs .onion hidden services, but I haven't played with Electrum for Android, so can't comment on that.

It bothers and annoys me, and I was a bit disappointed that that's what he got involved with. It's something I would expect the types of organizations I hope bitcoin will take on directly to be involved with. I was also disappointed that he moved his priorities to another company, because he was a really great developer and project manager, doing a great job of keeping us on track, and a great person to work with. Regardless of what his beliefs on the topic of financial regulations are, Jan Møller is a really great guy and an extremely skilled developer. Whatever company gets him is lucky to have him. And, despite my disappointment, it was his decision, I figured he would prefer to keep his personal business his, and announce it whenever he feels he's ready. Since we didn't really know much of the details about what his company actually does, besides track transactions as they propagate through the network (much like LocalTrader confidence graph tracks your transactions to make sure there aren't any issues), and since we were continuing to work on our own Mycelium stuff without him having access to add anything without our say, I didn't see a reason to warn about anything, or to impose on him.

@_date: 2015-03-10 14:53:46
Be careful when creating too many of them. Typically wallets scan through addresses 10 addresses ahead, and if they find that 10 have 0 transactions, they stop scanning. So by doing this you may create a situation where you will have to do some special work to be able to restore a backup (by forcing it to scan through many more empty addresses)

Where are you getting your information from? Why do you think I am saying "Ukie propaganda?" Why the derogatory terms? Do you even have anything at all personally at stake in this, or are you just reading about something that is happening somewhere else, and taking sides? (while my friends and family are literally living there, telling me how things are, and the whole situation is stressing and depressing me because I worry about them and have to help them out) And why are you engaging in whataboutism? (a common Russian diversionary tactic where, whenever someone brings up atrocities committed by Russia, Russia responds with "But what about...?" and brings up someone else's atrocities, as if those excuse their own actions)

Well, initially we didn't even think we would need it, but then we got so much interest that we started to worry about same thing happening to us that happened to Etherium.

@_date: 2015-11-13 00:23:02
Yeah, it's the old expert mode. We used to have a wallet that just used one address, and didn't do anything special becides sent and receive. Expert Mode would allow you to manage multiple accounts (still all single addresses), and was hidden because backing up was more complicated. Each address/account had to be backed up, and we didn't want people losing money thinking they have a backup when they only backed up the first one. When we went to HD, we got rid of Expert Mode and enabled all users to have multiple accounts, since, as long as they're all just HD accounts, they're all derived just from your 12 word backup seed.

We goofed a bit in this case, by having staged rollouts in Google Play Store, and simultaneously pushing an update to our website, which meant that everyone could see an update from our site (including the wallets) but not everyone could see it from Google Play until they reached the rollout threshold.

That sound is almost impossible to add. We have no way of knowing which addresses belong to you, so can't use push notifications to notify you. So the only way to add that sound notification is to have your wallet ping our servers or the blockchain constantly, for all your HD addresses, to see if any of them have received anything. That would quickly burn up your CPU, battery, and data plan.

That's the point that we are trying to cut out the middle man, so we don't waste millions on those.


No, because there will be issue if too few buy, they may think this is too little, and pull their money out. Then next people buy in, think it's too little, and pull out. In the end, the amount bought won't increase from zero. You should be able to sell the token later after you get it though.

We can't just refuse to send SAR money. That's illegal, but even more importantly, that's unethical. Technically we don't actually **need** the token back. My guess is it would just stay out there as an outstanding yet to be converted stock share. Don't forget that, since these are colored coins, we totally expect people to lose them the same way people lose bitcoins too (lost backup, badly formed transaction they did themselves, etc).
@_date: 2016-05-08 01:22:03


Tether. Also, it's the only way to do a fiat coin, unfortunately. You deal with bank money, you are going to have to rely on a bank. No way around it. If there was, we wouldn't have needed bitcoin in the first place, right?


This is no different from our current situation, where people can lose money in Coinapult Locks, or Cashila, or Glidera, should any of them become untrustworthy or run into trouble. But in all these cases we're just an intermediary, and they are providing the service. We'll make sure to stress that point once we start providing third party plugins. And any issues that arise will be the fault of the companies holding the money, just like any issues with apps on your phone are not the fault of your phone's OS developer.


We won't be getting into fiat gateway business. Our internal company policy is that we will never hold our customers' money. All keys to it will be on their phones. All issuance will be done through third parties. Less liability for us that way. So if anyone ends up going to jail, it would be whoever issues those fiat tokens, assuming they don't do their due diligence.
Thanks for your concern though.

LOL! What? Poroshenko is a billionaire. He doesn't need to be financed. And armed with what? Ukrainian military is BROKE. They are dependent on private donations from abroad just to afford helmets and body armor.


How do you know the footage you are watching isn't propaganda? There's a lot of "amateur and real life" footage coming from RT. And where is it that you find that footage exactly?


I got one better. Family and friends who live in Lviv and Kiev, who actually personally participated in the protests, and friends who live in Eastern Ukraine. I'm from Kiev myself, so I have personal connections. So my sources are coming from the people I talk to who actually live there, not from videos posted by who knows who.


That sounds like what Russia is scaring their citizens with. Russia had a contract with Ukraine to keep their naval base in Crimea, Ukraine had absolutely no interest in breaking that contract (since it would have led to war, and since Ukraine's economy and energy depends on Russia), and US had absolutely NO interest in having bases there, because until now, NO ONE in the world even saw Russia as an enemy. Russia made up that whole "US is an enemy that wants war with us" bullshit as an excuse for their own population. Russian economy is in shambles, and was crashing even before the sanctions. Ukraine starting to mine gas would have made things worse. And Russia needed to create an enemy, Ukraine and USA, as a way to distract its own people from their own economic and political problems. It's THE EXACT SAME THING that US did when Bush started the war with Iraq. US didn't give a shit about Ukraine then, and still doesn't.
It's funny, you didn't drink US koolaid, but you drank that *exact same* flavored koolaid when it came from Russia, which is a way worse dictatorship that US is.

So, you would create two random change transactions instead of one, and chain off each one independently, creating a tree structure, instead of, as is done now, create just one change transaction and use only that for future spends? That would work. My concern though is you may end up with a lot of small sums, with no way of spending without joining a bunch. But it would prevent a bystander who catches two of your addresses from linking things.
@_date: 2015-11-08 06:21:00
And if I see two of your addresses, I have a very good chance of linking all your addresses that happened in between. So if I see you once, then you leave and shop for a while, and I see you months later with another address, there's a good chance I can put together a string of your spends and change addresses, completely negating the HD privacy benefit.

You misunderstand. This wallet is to avoid the bloat. The current "regular wallet" includes LocalTrader, Coinapult Locks, Cashilla, Glidera (almost), Trezor, Ledger, and Ledger Trustlet. If we keep going in the same direction, the wallet will keep getting more and more bloated. That is exactly what I was worried about, and one of the reasons I decided to change directions. The new wallet will still have all of that, and more, BUT only if you choose to download and install those. If you want a basic wallet without bloat, you'll be able to have an even less bloated wallet than now, even being able to choose which Bitcoin core component you want to use (we're releasing Bitcore first). You'll still have option to send and receive invoices and have a list of contacts to chat and send money to (using encrypted channels), just cause that will be more prevalent for business payments, but otherwise it should be fairly light.

Our app does not uninstall when you update. If it got installed without you manually doing it yourself, the only thing I can think of is that maybe the phone wipes old apps before installing new ones, which would be strange.


Can you please describe what happened there exactly?
There is no way to create a warning before uninstalling, since the uninstall process happens outside of the app, and the app is not aware of it. The reason we wipe all app data during uninstall is to prevent a scenario where someone uninstalls their apps before giving their phone to someone else or throwing it away, and someone else installing our app back and stealing all their money.
As always, please remember to back up before putting money in a Bitcoin wallet, regardless of what wallet you use.

First, don't forget that 7,500 is the upper limit. Just what we don't believe our company will be valued at, even if our users do. We want to avoid the Etherium scenario, where they raised way too much money and then fuck ed it all up.
Regarding your estimates, go to bitcoincharts.com and look at the Markets exchange volume. Let's say Mycelium only managed to integrate 3 of the top exchanges on there: Bitfinex, Coinbase, and Kraken (we have no discussion with them yet, but plan to in the future). Combined they have a 30 day volume of about 740,000 BTC, or $333,000,000. Let's say users end up doing only 20% of their trading through our wallet through plugins, and we only charge 0.1% for that convenience. That's an annual revenue of $66,600.
Or let's assume we take over Coinbase's wallet, where Coinbase decides they don't want to bother coding a whole wallet and use ours as a plugin. Some peop,e still use their website, but 90% use their plugin in our wallet to trade. Their volume alone is 175,000 btc every 30 days, or $78,750,000. 90% of that, with a 0.1% fee, is $70,875 month.
Now, these are just guesses. We may charge more or less, we may have almost all exchange's supported through our wallet, or almost none, but I hope this gives you an idea of what we expect. This isn't even including things like merchant services (BitPay) or us partnering with Waves to build an alternative to the VISA network.

What? Mycelium doesn't ask for anything but camera (for QR codes) and location (coarse, within 1sq mile, only used if you manually ask it to find your location in LocalTrader). There's no private data requested or collected whatsoever. Heck, Mycelium even supports Tor natively  (through Orbot), so even your network connection can stay private.
As for connecting to our backend server to get address balances, we don't log that information, and we still insist that it's more private than using SPV (like Bitcoin Wallet app and others do), because bloom filters are terrible at hiding your privacy, and there's no guarantee that some random node you connect via SPV to isn't logging your IP and all your addresses. Sure, you have to trust us not to keep that information, but at least we make that promise and stake our reputation on it.

It prints the hash that proves your salt was included. So even if the entropy was compromised, adding your salt makes the compromise useless. Implementing all these types of extra security features after talking with REALLY paranoid people is a big reason it got delayed so much.

Stickers are the least important security features in these. If all we had to depend on was a sticker, we would have failed miserably at security. The devices include multiple entropy/RNG sources, restrictions to only accepting being flashed with signed firmware, and for extra security have the option to add Diceware salt to your keep, with a hash you can use to verify that its being used and is secure. If all you could depend on was that you were the only one who touched it, you wouldn't be able to lend it to anyone either. Basically, these were designed with the mindset that you shouldn't be able to trust US, the actual developers, and still feel safe with your keys.

Yes, we do. This is a conflict of devs who want to open everything vs CEO that wants to keep some of the backend services private so that we can use them to create paid-for services and actually make some money on this whole deal. Hopefully the devs will win this fight eventually.

Mycelium has already added built-in support for Tor. Now we just have to add CoinJoin and other wallets have to follow suit, and all this will be implemented without needing to do anything to bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:37:49
The only reason it hasn't been added is lack of time. We have had multiple requests for this, and it's in our To Do list already, but we are having to juggle multiple feature requests, bug fixes, and major feature additions, so some things sometimes take longer.

Yep, we want to do bitcoin, and do it well. Add things like Multisig, CoinShuffle, payment codes... But third parties won't leave us alone, bugging us to add them to our wallet. Now they can add themselves, while we focus on things we want to focus on, like what you mentioned.

Only the tokens themselves. You still have the right to any increase in valuation from that purchase, which you can withdraw as cash. So if your token is worth $10 at the time the company is worth $2mil, and someone buys it out for $10mil (5x valuation increase), you can sell your token back to get $10, AND have the right to another $40 on top of that, making your total that you get back 5x what you paid. Basically the token only represents the SAR right, andbis just used to prove that you are the owner of that right.
@_date: 2015-03-30 06:33:11

The hash signature that proves the salt is included is printed on the paper wallet along with the public/private key. You can use crypto tools to verify it (we should probably put up something simple to use on our site too..)

It's a waste of time because your brute forcing will get reduced from trillions of years to only millions, and also because we use two other sources of entropy (gate noise and built-in RNG, not including a salt you can provide yourself) in addition to the entropy they are taking about. That article is proof that that whole IRC group is a bunch of pompous idiots (though we thank them for the criticism, since it forces us to be even more secure)

In a private chat he said one problem with bitcoin that should be addressed is it's fixed volume and resulting volatility, that bitcoin would be better if the total amount of it could automatically adjust up and down based on price. That's impossible without a third party, and because price is relative (what if USD crashes? Should BTC follow?). These things Satoshi already considered and discussed at length, rejecting as being very bad ideas. So, Nick is definitely not Satoshi.

We typically have pur developers write and test the code on their own machines, and then push it to shared github all at once when it's ready to test. Since we have so few devs, and they typically work on their own specific projects, there hasn't been much need to collaborate on this in real time.
We dont really have anything to reward people with. Our company isn't earning money yet, and the services that we may earn stuff with are still being made. Even our Entropy devices have yet to pay off the cost of development, but we are at least fairly confident about those paying off.
All our development can happen in the open if people asked for it or asked to contribute, but no one does, and we rarely get outside contributions. So if you want to see CoinJoin development happen in the open, that can be arranged easily. We would love help, and need as much as we can get. Thats another reason the devs want to push for all open source: we're a bit jealous of how much outside support other wallets get, compared to ours :)
I don't know where that remote worked stance idea came from. Almost all of our workers are remote.

Mycelium rep here. In short, we don't actually keep any logs or IPs of addresses, and can't look them up ourselves unless we turn the logging on. With regards to your example, the servers would see 4000 BTC leave, then another 4000 BTC come back, not knowing if it's the same BTC, but it log that information.
However, you basically have nothing but our word (and reputation) to base this on. But, at least I  our case we're making a promise. If it was SPV connecting to random nodes, any one of those nodes could be tracking, logging, and associating your address. Unfortunately bloom filters aren't a good solution for that yet. The only reliable one is to run your own node that connects through Tor. For what you need, though, we should be adequate.

The database is no different from the blockchain database regarding it's content.

That's not security, thats just keeping someone from seeing your wallet balance, which is still a very niche request. Our security comes from the encryption of the private keys, the keys being stored in a location that can't be accessed by other apps, and with a pin that is required to spend or get any sort of access to your private keys, that will take a while to brute force, by which point you will hopefully have moved the coins.

It is a different company, where one of the lead developers used to be our lead developer, whom we still consider a friend and who still keeps in touch. Thus we may or may not get inside knowledge.

@_date: 2016-05-01 15:41:57
No developer resources as of yet, but basically you would need to write a backend app that knows how to process other coins (get balance updates, sign transactions), which could either be software that runs locally on the phone using SPV (like BitcoinJ) or on a server somewhere (for things that don't support SPV). Then you would write a plugin that lets users create your custom type of account, where our Wallet uses API calls to your software to ask for balances, and request to sign transactions. Your software would do that, send it back to the wallet, the wallet will ask the user to verify it, and then broadcast it.
We're still developing the API portion of it though, with Bitcoin as the first testcase/example.

Note that every one of those countries was NOT being invaded by an outsider.


US had absolutely ZERO to do with starting that civil war. US wasn't even involved until just a few months ago, and still isn't, since it's only STILL debating on whether to do anything at all.
This isn't a Eastern Ukraine separatists fighting against oppressive Ukrainian regime thing. Ukrainian government was taken down, is still trying to rebuild, and is too weak to do anything. Hell, even the Ukrainian armies fighting the separatists are mostly privately funded. No, this is Russia invading a neighboring country because it does not want an EU ally on its border, and because Eastern Ukraine has discovered MASSIVE shale gas reserves 2 years ago that it was about to start mining, which would have broken Russia's monopoly on supplying gas to EU. But you swallowed Russian warmongering propaganda completely.

It's always possible, especially if you have full access to hardware. So the most we could do is make that extremely difficult too do. That's why we also added a provable salt feature, so that even if the hardware and software are both compromised, with the added salt that backdoor is still useless. At the last we hope that will still make your paper wallets 100% secure, at the most we hope anyone considering backdooring these things would realize it's a waste of money and resources and not bother.

Right now accepting bitcoin = free advertising, because bitcoiners tend to flock to businesses that accept bitcoin. Whatever fees you pay for using your credit card are 0 if you accept bitcoin. Being able to give a discount equal to whatever you would pay for your credit card fee is basically getting the same revenue, while offering a "sale" to attract customers.
If using numbers, say a credit card transaction costs you 2%. You can give a 2% discount for using bitcoin, and still get the same revenue as you would if you sold using a credit card.

The second paragraph in the antiwar article:


Ukraine did want peace, but Russian soldiers and instigators, not the population living there, started causing havoc in the exact same way that tactic was used in Georgia. Then they started attacking Ukraine supporters and Ukrainian troops, at which point the war started. Ukraine was trying to defend its own people against what it saw as foreign invaders and instigators. 
The "soverign population" in question are the few who want to fight Ukraine and create their own what seems like near totalitarian state of sorts. The areas under separatist controls are similar to areas controlled by military warlords. Everyone who could, has already escape them.
The referendum mentioned was a joke, since voting booth had stationed armed guards to intimidate anyone from voting wrong, many areas didn't even have voting booths available, and the votes themselves were tampered with, including having tens of thousands of premade "Yes" ballots, destroyed ballots, and even simply releasing numbers planned days ahead of time without actually counting the votes. Not to mention that the referendum was preceded by massive Russian propaganda that painted the new Ukrainian government as fascist in order to scare the population into voting against it. Ironically, it was the far-right Russian organizations that staged the vote, and the far-right fascist groups who are fighting there and leading parts of the separatist groups now.

Fixed total amount, and that amount should be adjusted, inflated and deflated, to keep the price stable. Satoshi and many others from a long time ago discussed this issue in depth, and figured out that it's impossible without a third party. That's really why we have mining in the first place.

Name comes from our yet-to-be-released Bitcoincard. It's a hardware wallet that uses peer-to-peer mesh networking to transmit data, so you can send bitcoin without needing an internet connection. As long as enough Bitcoincards are in the area, they all establish a meshed network among each other, and as long as one of the cards is within range of an internet connected dongle, all of them can broadcast and receive transactions. The mesh is where Mycelium name comes from.

To elaborate, the privacy issues are:
We at Mycelium make a promise to not log or track your IPs and address balances, BUT you have to trust us
An SPV node that Schildbach wallet connects to can be any random node that makes no such promises, and can log all your IP's and addresses
The only guaranteed solution is to run your own node and configure your wallet to connect only to it, or to connect to a node you trust.

Whether we claim to have broken things off, or make statements about support for anonymity, will not matter, since either way you will only have our word to trust. It's only our actions, and the code we use that will show that we can't track you even if we wanted to, that will matter (such as our Tor implementation, P2P encryption, and future CoinJoin support)

There's a bug (oversight) on the iOS wallet, where it does not check for transactions on old previously used addresses. This should be fixed in the next version. As you know, HD wallets create a new address every time you make a deposit or spend money. What this iOS thing means is that the two wallets may be out of sync, and the iOS one isn't including the balances of the older addresses in the Android one.

May just have been a damaged unit. We flashed them all in office ourselves, so ideally all units should have been fine, but we had one that just didn't work at all, and I guess yours is another one that's being funny (we're glad out of 800 we only had 2 so far).

Personally I have been a bit frustrated about not being able to keep you updated every week. With these devices being out of our hands, we get too few updates from the factories, and have to keep pestering them to tell us what's going on.

The text above the address. You're right, I can't verify it either. I'm guessing Reddit did something to it. Sorry.
Found the problem. When copying the text to sign, Reddit's quote format (the &gt; prefix) adds some sort of special formatting to the text. I removed that quote style, and formatted the signature properly now.
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:42:33


Pretty secure. If your android isn't rooted, it's probably secure for at least a thousand or two, but I wouldn't store your life savings on it.


You probably downloaded Bitcoin Core. The reason it's taking so long is because it has to verify every block and every set of transactions since the beginning of time. The throttling isn't your internet, but your memory, processor, and hard drive. If you do wait it out and download the whole blockchain, you can run that version as an actual bitcoin node, and support the network. If you don't want to wait, don't want to use up 25 gigs of your hard drive space, and won't be leaving it on all the time anyway, I suggest you install Electrum instead.
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:56:36
The backup should be just fine security-wise, but there's still an obsolescence problem. Imagine in you had a backup on a floppy disk right now. You'd be screwed. Also the new version of Mycelium uses HD wallets that follow all the newest bitcoin standards (BIP32, BIP39, BIP44), meaning the backup it makes, which are just 12 words, can be restored in any other wallet that uses those standards, like Trezor, Wallet32, and Multibit HD. So even if Mycelium is not around any more, you will still be able to restore your addresses. So I would advise moving to the standard if it's not too much hassle. Or at least go to our website (mycelium.com) on our Wallet page, and download the backup tool for PCs, just so you can have it in case something happens to us.

Anything backed to anything else, like dollars or gold or company stock, will have a single entity backing and a single point of failure. From what I understand,  the doing is only required to buy it with USD,  or to sell it through them back to USD. Once it's "in the wild," it's traded like any other coin.


Only for savings and simplicity of being able to come troll it and move it however you want. And you just described exactly why bitcoin (and things like it) is superior to everything else, like the current banking system.


That won't work for being able to use your USD bank account to pay USD at a restaurant that only takes USD...

We're still here. We were hoping to get the devices in the office today, but it looks like they'll be coming in next week. Then we'll finally flash, pack, and ship. Sorry it took so long. We ran into tons of snags at almost every step of the way, the last one being somewhat incompetent factory workers who wouldn't figure out how to flash initial firmware until I showed them over Skype video chat, and the latest being the buttons we ordered, which we specifically tested with pre-made 3D printed ones, ending up being a few micron too thick and getting stuck when you press them. /sigh/ Believe me, we want to get these things done and out as soon as possible, too. They have been a nasty drain on our reputation. If you want your money back, we can of course arrange that too.

You can create a new Single Address account in Mycelium, make a backup of just that address by going to Settings &gt; Legacy Backup, and that will create a PDF that you can save somewhere. You willjust have to make sure to write down the 16 character password needed to decrypt that PDF (and keep in mind that each new PDF is encrypted with a different password). That way the keys are generated securely on your phone, you just have to write down 16 letters, and and you can send that PDF any way you like. Mycelium should be fairly secure as long as your phone isn't rooted.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:35:29

You can't really write stuff to the device. Just flash it with firmware that is signed by a signature matching the one in settings.txt. So while installing malware on it is technically possible, it's not an easy task
@_date: 2016-05-01 14:50:16
Before. However, don't forget that taking out cash, selling your token, and using the proceeds to buy IPO stock is just one option. You can also cobine your SAR ownership (cash you are owed you didn't withdraw) and token into a proportionally same share of stock directly (I.e. if I bought 1% of the company, and never withdrew my SAR cash, I will always have a claim to 1% of the company, and during the IPO can convert it to stock representing 1% ownership). However, please don't rely on future IPO for your investment. There is no guarantee that we will have one.

Sorry, I meant light wallets for phones. Mycelium runs a node as a Tor hidden service, guaranteeing a connection through Tor. I'm not aware of any others that do, besides Electrum, but I haven't even seen an Android version of Electrum yet, nor do I know if it supports Tor.


Address relations is a problem, yes. We hope that CoinJoin will solve that problem. Before then, we may also implement things to make address relation more difficult by simulating CoinJoin, where we will use multiple inputs, and create multiple change outputs of similar size alongside the spending transaction. This may make it difficult to tell whether those multiple change transactions belong to the user, or are a part of a CoinJoin transaction. We're not sure about this yet, but will be discussing it soon.


Yes, although we claim that we don't log your IP or addresses, we have no guarantees about that and don't expect our users to trust us. That's why we have added Tor, and plan to add CoinJoin. Hopefully that will be enough.
The long term goal is to use whatever technologies we can to make any data on our servers be verifiably worthless, regardless of our claims.
Again, sorry for not reporting about this sooner. We knew that Jan was working in a different company on a project that would attempt to track transactions to help with regulatory compliance and prevent fraud, but we were not aware of any of the technical details whatsoever.

We haven't reached our cap yet, so no one is disadvantaged, yet, but we will put that notice on the sale site, and keep repeating it when we can. If 4k gets committed in your example, everyone who bought the first 2k will get their 100% of 5%, and the remaining 2k will get their payments returned. It's basically first come first serve. We are consulting in regards to what to publish when.
The reason this seems so unorganized is that we didn't even consider a cap at first, since we didn't even think we would need it. But interest from some investors made that a concern, so we are trying to figure out the best way to deal with it. Hopefully we still won't need it

We dont want people leaving their phone for a second, someone setting a pin, and them being locked out of their own money. As for the backup, it's just a bunch of simple English words. Its hard to get them wrong, since you dont even have to know how to spell them. You just pick them from a list as you type in the first few letters. We really tried to make it as simple as possible. Considering how many help mails we get of people losing their wallets, and then saying they don't have backups, we are actually very temped to make backups and verifications of them mandatory, even to just use the wallet in the first place.

The point of LocalTrader was to help newbies get their first coins after they install the app. Having it elsewhere wouldn't help with that. Then again, LT hasn't been much help either. We really need to expand it with better feedback and reputation and such.

FYI, it's impossible to force the user to do anything before allowing an uninstall for any app. Uninstalls happen outside of the app, and apps aren't aware of it. No way to do any hooks or splash pages. This is probably to prevent devs from making malware apps that are impossible to uninstall.

Yeah, we had to teach the factory workers how to flash them over a Skype video call, since they couldn't follow written instructions (cost us a week), and more recently the buttons we ordered, which we had 3D printed to make sure they would fit, were not pressed hard enough, or something, so they got stuck when they are pressed in. In any case, the devices are en route to our office now, and should be there this week. At that point we flash, pack, and ship. We may need to file down each button a tad, though. Since we have 800 of those to process, it may still take a bit.

If you are expecting a payment on an address, and it doesn't show up, you will probably know. At the least the person who sent you that payment will tell you that they sent the money and to which address it was sent to. Really, stopping your wallet from knowing about received transactions is not much of a compromise. And that's about the ONLY thing our servers can do to compromise your wallet. Besides, it's so easy to catch that we would be stupid to do something like that.

Mycelium wallets connect to our server nodes. Other people's versions would flood us with errors, and we wouldn't know whether that's our wallet or someone else's.

If a similar fork happened with BTC, the weaker fork would get attacked and mined out of existence. Have you heard of the mining concept of "tossing a frizbee on the roof?" I don't know why that wasn't done with ETH, but I suspect it's because of the fundamental differences between ETH and BTC.

I would have secured them better by adding a sticker on the other side too (I got them the way you got them before shipping), but I had very few extra stickers. Should have been put on the front.

Generally no. They would have to actually log into the device, get passed the secure storage restrictions, and pull the database with the encrypted keys out of there. Even if the device is rooted and had some malicious app, that's still a stretch.

The only way to verify your ownership of a bitcoin address is with a bitcoin private key. There isn't an actual person to verify identities and ownership, or things like phone numbers, wallet IDs, our any other personally identifiable information. Private key, or a backup of it in the form of 12 words, is the only option. And wallet apps don't allow the phone to back up your private key along with the standard phone backup, because there is a risk that the user will leave their phone with a carrier, and an employee from that carrier will just steal all their money.
Sorry to bring you bad news. Maybe the carrier still has your phone with the data, and they haven't wiped it yet?

Those pictures aren't lack of regulation, they are the government regulating that the factories creating that pollution are necessary for the good of the economy, the people, and the country, and preventing anyone from being able to stop those companies or take them to court over pollution. That is, in fact, government regulation of pollution, except in this case the regulation is a mandate.
Kind of how in US regulation against pollution allowed Horizon and BP who spilled oil in the gulf to get away with a small fine tantamount to a slap on the wrist in exchange for protection from prosecution from private beach owners and fishing companies. Yes, regulation that protects our environment by preventing us from suing polluters for damages is **always** the best option.

This user has been scamming a bunch of Myceliuum's LocalTrader buyers, usually **people new to bitcoin who want to buy it for the first time**, by having them wire money via Western Union and never sending bitcoin back. He has stolen about $1,500 just this week alone. We have sent a request for help to Western Union, and will be filing a police report if they have any information that they can provide. In the mean time, please avoid trading with this guy, and if you can help us track him down in any way, that will help (At Mycelium, we really DON'T keep any information on our users and traders).
@_date: 2015-02-21 02:12:13
We'll be adding BIP70 Payment Protocol to Mycelium soon. Hopefully that will help with issues such as these, because instead of broadcasting the transaction directly, you would be sending a signed copy of it to the merchant (Coinbase in this case), and they will receive it, verify it, and only broadcast it themselves if everything is fine. The transaction information will also have a refund address. In your situation, Coinbase would have either rejected the second transaction, or refunded the money soon after.
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:35:31
That's true, but rather useless when people can just check those transactions in blockchain.info. We already have issues where our servers aren't aware of a transaction and you have to check elsewhere, with the transaction only showing up after it gets confirmed into a block, although that's very rare. So this isn't anything new or unusual.

Typing keys means they go through your keyboard, and there's a high risk of the keyboard recording and reporting what you type elsewhere (such as in spellcheck, or reporting for possibly new words). Even Google keyboard may do this. But I'll ask the devs about that option.

It's a sad over-reaction to "government media." Many of these people spent years believing that everything the media tells them is made up government propaganda, so when the media actually says something true, and another government (Russia) actually stages an **actual** propaganda campaign, they all fell for it, thinking that their own media is still lying to them. It's especially sad, considering Putin is pretty much a totalitarian dictator, the deposed "democratically elected" Ukrainian president was in the process of giving himself dictatorial powers, and the separatists are trying to start a military junta state. All pretty much the exact opposite of the liberty stuff that Bitcoin stands for.

It hasn't been done to this level. The cybil component of this helps track transactions as they literally propagate through the network in real time (actually, the idea came out from the LocalTrader transaction confidence graph, where our own 3 nodes connect to nodes on the network and monitor transaction propagation). So these guys are taking it to the next level by adding a whole bunch of their own nodes too.

That's one of the main reasons I continue to trust Mycelium.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:32:03
It may not happen for a while, since doing that requires the app to continuously drain your CPU resources/battery and your data plan. We don't know any of your addresses, so we can't use push notifications. The only way the app would know that you got paid is if it synchronizes all the addresses to check for incoming transactions. Imagine all the apps around the world doing it constantly, for dozens of addresses per phone...

I'm not sure it's even possible to get accurate numbers. For examp,e I have Coinbase, Blockchain, Mycelium, and Armory wallets, and I have downloaded probably every other wallet out there. But I'm just one person. So whatever metric you use will have either abandoned wallets, or wallets that overlap, being used by the same person. Plus bitcoin is designed to be anonymous and private, so there are probably plenty of people who get wallets using some other means, or use wallets that aren't on mainstream sites (like Silk Road wallets when those existed). Best you can do is follow the number of transactions to track activity, but even though are screwed up by trading bots.
FYI, Mycelium has about 100,000 downloads so far.

It may not happen for a while, since doing that requires the app to continuously drain your CPU resources/battery and your data plan. We don't know any of your addresses, so we can't use push notifications. The only way the app would know that you got paid is if it synchronizes all the addresses to check for incoming transactions. Imagine all the apps around the world doing it constantly, for dozens of addresses per phone...

Colu will be integrated by end of the month. That's what our crowdsale tokens are on. Do they know about Coinprism. They may have to integrate themselves 
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:34:36
Don't forget that the tokens don't represent the 5% just by themselves. If 5% of the company is valued at $2mil, and then company value doubles where 5% is now worth 4$, the tokens themselves are still worth $2 mill, and the SAR right on top of them is worth the other $2mil. It's the same situation if the value of USD drops by half while company itself doesn't grow. I guess if USD completely disappears, the tokens themselves won't be worth anything in USD, and will only be worth diverging in BTC. Not sure what we would buy them back for. Or if we would even need to. May just convert it to some other asset entirely.

* The license allows us to to keep all our code completely open, and allows anyone to freely contribute, but lets us make sure that people don't make crappy broken versions of our app that we wouldn't be able to debug. It's a quality control thing more than anything else, and we have been discussing going full open source.
* What network monitor? The only thing we use the network for is to check your balances and broadcast signed transactions when you actually run the app
* We don't know exactly what was violated with Google. They may have gotten spooked by our new version letting you choose bitcoin network fees, thinking we are the ones collecting that fee. They will get back to us within 72 hours.
* Private keys are encrypted, and have been for a while now. But it's the memory that you should be concerned about where keys can get stolen, not just storage. So key encryption is useless if a rooted malicious app wants to steal your coins. We are looking at implementing Rivetz and/or Ledger to address that problem.
* SPV is actually LESS secure than our method. When you use an SPV wallet, every node you connect to know your IP address and bitcoin addresses. Our system doesn't track your IP or address balances, and the current beta adds support for Tor that will make tracking those impossible even if we wanted to. We will also be adding CoinJoin support, making our wallet even more secure and private. That said, SPV support will be implemented too, as a fallback should our system become unavailable.
* We updated our FAQ just a few months ago mycelium.com/wallet/help_20.html
We're definitely not going anywhere.

Sean's Outpost and Satoshi Forest are still going strong. He delegates a lot of running of both to others there, and I think recently Satoshi Forest won yet another lawsuit brought against them by their local government. And those two charities still need money for food, supplies, and legal fees. The government and some of their neighbors just can't seem to leave them alone.
Jason King himself is currently very busy with Unsung.org (you can check out their Facebook page, there's a whole lot of activity), and that project will be way bigger and more impactfull than the first two. He's also working on Bounti, which may become a mobile version of OpenBazaar, and Tundra. So he's definitely still around, still very active and busy, and still going to conferences. He just doesn't post on Reddit any more.

I've never lost anyone's money that I have been trusted with. Not the hundreds of bitcoins I held as treasurer of bitcointalk.org forum, and not the money I held for the Bitcoin100 charity. I was against the idea of a token sale for Mycelium, but was asked to handle it, and from what I'm told the money was spent on the company. Even if some of it wasn't, the CEO is spending his own money to keep it going again, so in one pocket, out the other, making the point a bit moot. But I personally have never even seen the money raised, let alone been "trusted" with it.
In hindsight, I believed in the company and the team, so I was convinced this would work out ok, even though it would add risk. It's still working out, albeit slowly, so I'm still sticking around.
If you were to say "anyone who trusts you to run a successful business is making a big mistake," then maybe. I was put in charge of the project, and it didn't get to where it needed to in the time I wanted it to (in part because I didn't have the money to hire developers that I thought I did). But this wasn't anything intentional or malicious.
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:35:51
Well, we don't actually know that. They could be legit. I think our CEO is working with them, so I think he knows what he's doing. Regarding the wallet, though, that's entirely my responsibility, so from my standpoint, Waves can add their functionality to our wallet, or they could be a scam, and it doesn't really affect us, since we have our own set of goals to focus on.
We're having a wallet strategy meeting weigh all our developers and our CEO tomorrow and Monday, so I'll ask him about it then.

It's not pro-American, it's pro-European, and mostly just anti-Russian. That America was involved is just Russian propaganda to scare their own citizens. Almost all of the claims about that are made up. America didn't even care about Ukraine, and only very reluctantly started providing support years later. I know, because I'm in America, have ties with Ukrainian organizations, and they have been very angry and frustrated with America ignoring the whole situation in Ukraine and not sending any help or being in any way involved at all, despite these groups asking for it over and over and over. If you think America was involved, you were blinded by Russian propaganda. Russia was involved, because a lot of gas was discovered in Eastern Ukraine, and Dutch Shell and Chevron were building methods to extract it, which would have broken Russia's monopoly on gas to Europe.
Panama papers didn't really reveal anything bad about Poroshenko either. A lot of people did business with many of the companies in those papers. That doesn't mean they were hiding their money there, or that those companies were bad. Even Erik Voorhees was found in those papers, simply because he did some business in Panama while living there. And what's wrong with making money? Who cares if someone had a good business and sells a lot of things that people want? It doesn't mean he is taking money from people in poverty, or keeping them in poverty. That's just an economically illiterate claim. What has he actually done to hurt the people? My friend tell me that, besides the was with Russia, they are much better off under Poroshenko than under the Russian puppet.

They still have to remember and back up a password, and possibly a 2-factor account, unless they use a crappy password, and coinbase isn't liable for thefts from that. So they might as well make an HD wallet based on a 2 word seed. At least they'll have their own keys, even if they won't be much more secure.
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:31:52
If you think of Bitcoin as a distributed asset system, then this is a distributed liability system. Like Ripple, but opensource, without restrictions or weird XRP, and WAY more functionality. A decentralized exchange would be the first obvious use. Others would be changing anything into a currency backed by that thing, doing off-chain transactions, making anonymizing bitcoin transactions way easier, etc.
Once you "get it," you'll probably realize that this thing has as much potential to change the world of finance as Bitcoin does, and it's the first thing I'm personally putting heavy support behind.
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:07:06
From what I've been told, the raised funds were converted to USD and EUR right away.
A lot of the funds were spent to pay back the legal fees to do the whole corporate restructuring that broke up Mycelium into individual smaller subsidiaries, including setting up the wallet as its own company, and on the legal stuff needed to structure the tokens in the way that we did (with tokens being a stake in the company). The rest of the money was spent on developer salaries and company management salaries, like HR, accounting, legal, overall company product manager, etc. (I as just the wallet product manager earned very little actually).
The project took longer than we hoped, and ran into issues, such as cross platform things we tested turning out to be woefully lacking on security, especially in iOS. So we eventually decided to just focus on Android. I'm not sure why the rebuild of the core, specifically switching from our proprietary bitlib library to BitcoinJ and SPV took so long. I had hoped it would be ready last winter, but I guess lack of developers and resources ended up stretching that out too far.
Unfortunately the increase in transactions and the resulting unconfirmed transaction backlog ended up taxing our servers too much in the last two months, so we lost a lot of time optimizing and expanding our back end too, just to make sure our users' service was uninterrupted. This is one of the main reasons I was pushing to switch to SPV - to unload our resources on the network or users' own nodes - but I guess we didn't get there in time.
But, regardless, we're still working, still pushing out updates, and still making progress towards our original plans of making the wallet earn money, become self sustaining, and eventually pay dividends. Those affiliate links (looked like ads, but were only local to the app and only sent people to our partners' sites to show what our wallet supports) were part of that push to get the wallet to start earning money (though obviously a badly planned one).
I'll post more on what's going on with the company, and with me, later.

It's not the Iranian government, it's the trade restrictions of other countries.

That's true. The two figures I've heard are 1 out of every 180 transactions is fraudulent, and an average of 3% of annual losses are due to charge backs. So take the 2.5% transaction fee, 3% chargeback losses, and businesses have to add 5.5% to their prices to let us use credit cards.

Simple question: Walk me through an example of how MtGox could be manipulating the price. All the claims that "it *could* be" have yet to actually walk through the steps.

The idea of using free speech to trade Bitcoin was brought up a long while ago. Basically you meet, the guy gives you cash, and you **say** the private key that stores the bitcoins being bought.

This isn't conductivity, this is more speed of magnetic permiance (how quickly magnetic fields go through it), and by extention how quickly it can generate eddy currents (mini electromagnetic storms). The second best material is actually aluminum, not copper. But a device that relies on such technology to, say, magnetically suspend 100 pounds, would be about 1.5 to 2 cubic feet in size if you used aluminum for insulation (due to needing a thick amount of that aluminum insulation), while if you use gold, it could be only 2 inches in size or so. Due to the electromechanical forces involved in such systems (speed of magnetic flux permiation and such), there is a lower limit to how small you can build tech that relies on such insulators, and without gold, they are typically too large and bulky to use for anything other than massive industrial tools. (no tiny rail guns and such)
So gold has the "intrinsic value" of being the only material that would allow us to build magnetic levitation technology on a scale smaller than X.

You are correct, a third party will still have to hold the gold. You can get the third party to be more trustworthy by having them put up a "bond" equal to the value of that gold in bitcoin, and have that bond be stored in a multisignature pool, where a lot of people would have to sign off on transactions for the owner to take any money out. It would make it more difficult for the third party to just up and run with the funds.
The reason this system is great is because you don't need a specific server to operate it. All you need is the issuer to issue the tokens, and the buyers to keep records of their purchases (which the OT software does and manages automatically). Then the token owners can trade the tokens amongst themselves however they want, without the issuer having to track or care about what they are doing. And even if the server they were trading on goes down, they can just switch to another server, since the only thing the servers do is sign off on transactions, like notaries. All the data about who owns what is distributed, stored with the actual owners and issuers. So, basically, OT does what ColoredCoin does (and more), but without needing to rely on the bitcoin blockchain.

Waitwaitwait! Before speculating on all the results of their manipulation, go back to step 1. They raise the price by $60.34. How do they do that?
* If they make a fake account, they.....? I guess would be trading same as any other traders? How will that change the market any more than any other traders could?
* If they make a fake sale, someone else would have to be there to buy that fake sale. If the sale was fake, that someone else will find out rather quickly when they spend their USD, but get nothing in return. Even if they keep selling to themselves, they won't be changing the price until someone else buys up their offer (Supply/Demand changes price only when demand goes up), and if they are simply buying to amass bitcoins, again, how is that any different from any other legitimate trader doing the same?
* If they change the information on their front page directly, someone will see "There is 1 bitcoin available for X dollars? Ok!" and as soon as they put in a buy and get something completely different, they will realize that the price was fake. Enough of this happens and they won't  be able to hide it either.

I am guessing, based on history that showed that whenever there was a huge rise or crash, volume was enormous.

Yes. Blockchain.info is different in that although it's an online wallet, the actual wallet code and the private key are all on your computer. They get encrypted before they get uploaded to blockchain.Info's servers, so they can't just steal your money or lose it to hacks like other e-wallets can.

Buying bitcoins. Right now, you will spend more on hardware than that hardware will actually earn you. i.e. if you spend 1BTC on hardware, you will likely mine 0.7BTC throughout the life on that hardware, AND spend some BTC on the electricity to mine it. You are better off just buying the 1BTC outright.

* Buying internet access, or buying News Network Access (NNTP) in places where that is not allowed or is blocked by other payment methods
* Donating money to and supporting causes that are otherwise not politically supported (Wikileaks, Anonymous, etc.)

Yes. Well, no.

However, if you have a bitcoin address that stores some amount, but requires more than one person to sign off on (multi-signature transactions), or if you have a bitcoin address where all the money is kept locked until some time, or any bitcoin address that has some other sort of programmed function into it, those addresses will start with a 3.

By the way, a more correct financial strategy is to put money wherever you have the highest interest rate. If that means a loan, you put most of your money into that loan. If that means a stock or some other investment, you put your money into that investment, and pay minimum into the loan. That's how wealthy people get to where they are.

The Address Book text just doesn't fit. It's the least important of the bunch, too. Making them too small will also make the tab buttons too small on some devices. We will probably fix that with a UI redesign, but for now it's too small of an issue.


We never had a request for that before.


We hope that your phone itself is password protected and encrypted. The PIN is only supposed to be a deterrent, so that if your phone is stolen while unlocked, the thief will need to take a few hours to crack it, by which time you have hopefully moved your coins elsewhere. We already have a time-locked (rather blockchain-locked) PIN reset function. Maybe we can add something that if you enter a PIN incorrectly 5 times, you will have to wait for at least 10 block confirmations to try again.


Private keys are stored in a database, in a protected storage location accessible only to the app (and rooted apps), set to not be exported by backup programs (so make sure you have a 12 word backup), and encrypted with a constant key. If your phone is rooted and unlocked, they can steal it, yes. If it is locked, or unlocked and not rooted, they won't be able to get to it. The best defense is to encrypt your whole phone with a password or long pin required to unlock it, and a pin in your Mycelium wallet for extra protection (there was a story years ago of someone sitting in an airport bathroom stall, and someone else busting open the door, grabbing their phone, and running off. That's what the PIN is supposed to protect against).

Suppose I have 30 people who have donated, each of them pledging 1BTC per charity, and 15 of them have actually donated 2 or 3 BTC each. Each time they donate, I record that as 
Assets:Cash  $WhateverAmountTheyGave     |     Liabilities:Donated
The Donated is a liability because until that money goes to a charity, it's still theirs. If the fundraiser folds, we must return it. Since each of them only wants 1BTC of their donation to go to charity, right after their donation I do the following entry for all of them
Liabilities:Donated $1     |     Income:Ready to Send to Charity
What this does is reducee each person's Liability:Donated account by one. This means that those who have only donated 1BTC now have all their donation ready to be sent out (their Liability account is 0), while those who donated 2 or more still have some left over for the next charity. After all the funds from the Ready to Send account is sent, or if the fundraiser folds, I need to quickly look up how much each person still has in their Liability:Donated account, either to take another 1BTC out of it, or to return whatever amount they have left. Instead of searching through the text and manually adding and subtracting all entries to each individual person's Liabilities account, the -P option sums up ALL entries for each individual person for each account, so running that command (and limiting it to Donated account) gives me an easy list organized by donator name, with the exact amount they still have outstanting. That's the function that was easy to get to in GnuCash (called the Aging Report) that I wasn't sure I can do in Ledger.

OMG! Gavin thinks miners are evil! O.O (posted a request for a fix in the comments section)
One other point Gavin mentioned I think is important (convinced me, anyway). He was asked on his opinion of alt coins, like litecoin and such, which he calls “alternacoins.” He made two points:
First, the Bitcoin protocol is very flexible. He hasn't seen anything from any alt coins that is actually a benefit over Bitcoin so far, but if anything does come up, even if that something is a new hashing algorithm, Bitcoin can just implement the improvement too.
Second, good developers will look at the cryptocoin landscape, and will very likely choose to develop software and hardware for a well established and widely used currency. As such, Bitcoin will likely *always* have the best developers and the best support, so any new features will much more likely first appear in Bitcoin, and any security issues will likely be discovered in bitcoin before they are discovered in any alt coins. This last point even shoots down my "using alt coins for diversification purposes" idea.

Lots of people have preconceived notions about what money is, how economics work, and what is usefull for the greater good (taxes, social programs, etc). Bitcoin goes against a lot of those things, being unbacked by commodities or governments, being deflationary (Austrian) instead of managed/inflationary (Keynesian), and being more geared towards free market and private exchange, since it was specifically designed to ignore regulation and financial controls. So people who are happy with the way things are, or think they understand how things work, get unhappy when something threatens change and threatens to prove them wrong.
There's also the problem of a lot of such people being absolutely convinced in their belief that bitcoin is totally worthless and a scam years ago, who are now very envious and annoyed at the price rise, who are really hoping to see it crash and burn, just because they are jealous, or just because they want to be proven right.

If this account was set up back in 2011, then Bitcoin wasn't considered a currency at the time. It was just online fake game money thing. Maybe Gox should have gotten a license after FinCEN came out with their suggestion, but we even now don't know whether Bitcoin should be classified as a currency or a commodity. Maybe what ahppened is a good thing, in that the government will finally be forced to make a decision either way.

Hashing is a one-way function. Well, theoretically. It takes a split-second to generate a public address from a private key, and as long as the universe will exist to generate a private key from a public address. Reason is that you use simple math to get a public address from a private key, but the only way to find the private key from a public is to randomly pick private keys and running that same math to get a public address, and then see if it matches what you're looking for.
Don't worry about anyone ever finding out your public address. Read up on PGP signatures as a good starter on what's going on. Bitcoin basically does the exact same thing with public/private keys.

Why can't phone SPV clients just request random address balances, only some of which are relevant to them?
And yeah, that transaction limit is a software limit that can be removed. Did you ever read the Scaling article on the Bitcoin wiki?
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:56:20
Article got their worth wrong. They said they managed to buy 1% of all bitcoins that could exist, and spent $11 million from August 2012 to early spring buying it, spreading their buys instead of doing it all at once. That means their $11 million investment netted them 210,000 bitcoins, and is worth $178 million at today's prices.

It uses a single seed to generate all your addresses. The offline computer creates a seed to generate public and private keys, then you export the wallet with the public key seed to your online computer. You can then use that public key seed to generate as many addresses on the online computer as you want.
So, when you want to receive money, you just generate an address, and send money to it. When you want to send money, you pick that address, create a transaction that would send money from that address to another one, and save it to a file (USB drive). Then you take that file to your offline computer and open it with the offline wallet. Since it knows about all addresses and corresponding private keys thanks to them all being based on that seed, it finds the private key needed for the address in that signature, signs the transaction with the private key, and again saves the file back to the USB drive. Then you take the USB drive back to the online computer, and at that point, since the transaction is already created and signed, it just needs to broascast it to be included in the blockchain.

There are two kinds of charity: feel-good charity, and functional charity. The first one is where you toss a dollar in some bucket, or write a check to some charity that shows starving kids on the TV, where your money goes to some organization you don't really know much about, and some small bit of that money trickles through the system and gets someone some food, some clothes, or some other neccessity. Otherwise, it doesn't change much besides make someone's life a little easier, while stil dependent on charity. This is feel-good charity, because we do it for no other reason than to pat ourselves on the back and make ourselves feel good about being generous or "socially responsible."
Then there is functional charity. This is where you donate to some kids to put them through school/college, so that they can become productive members of society. Or donate to some start-up, so that it can develop some technology/idea, a market and some jobs in their local fledgeling economy. This business (if not a scam) along with practically all bitcoin purchases of products/services from restrictive regimes, can fall squarely within the functional charity category. The shoes do look nice, but even if the prices are higher than what you can get elsewhere, by using bitcoin to buy these shoes (or anything from Iran, Argentina, or other restrictive regimes), you are helping to get bitcoin into those countries, where obtaining it can otherwise be next to impossible (no exchanges available), and helping businesses grow and provide for their local economy. Even if the shoes turn out to be crap, and this guy just ends up with a ton of riped-off bitcoin, that **still** means that there are now tons of new bitcoins there, (or any value, really) being used to purchase things in that area, and paying for the jobs of others who sell those things to him.
So, personally, I see supporting these types of business not as just "Yay, I can spend my bitcoins" thing, but as a good charitable contribution to something that may actually make a difference (and still feel ok with it if I end up paying a bit more). This, of course, again, assuming that this isn't a scam.

Actually, it's a commodity, just as all currencies are. It's just that there's no one out there trying to keep the price suppressed as more people invest in it.

With MtGox having such an issue with applications backlog, and people wishing to decentralize exchanges at least a little bit, maybe BitFloor won't have problems paying back this loan after all. With MtGox's volume, if they also charged a 0.4% fee, they would make 848BTC a day on fees alone. That's a 30 day payback period. Now, obviously, Bitfloor doesn't have anywhere near MtGox's volume, but with more people switching, and the overall trading volume increasing rapidly as more people get into Bitcoin, seeing Bitfloor pay back the whole debt within one or two years doesn't seem too far-fetched.
Regarding recent issued regulatory messages, those were about MSB's, and Bitfloor is registered. Aside from the debt he's paying back, the business itself is still solvent.
EDIT: Disclosure, I don't work for or represent Bitfloor, but I do have some money tied up in their debt.

My opinion is that Kenya would have the biggest benefit to adopting it, and that it will be much easier to get adoption in Kenya than other 1st world countries. Mainly because everywhere else, people say, "I already have an established stable currency backed by my government, already have digital payments in the form of credit/debit cards, and to buy something I just swipe, so why do I need bitcoin?" That is a very difficult thing for bitcoin to compete against, since people generally don't care about inflation or 2% fees. Your opinion differs, which is fine. These are just opinions after all. Feel free to write an article or a post about which country you believe should be targeted for bitcoin adoption.

Multi-signature banking. You store one of the signatures required to spend at home, and have multiple backups, the other signature is stored in one or two other "banks." In this way, no one can spend your money without your signature, and they can't even beat it out of you, since just knowing your signature won't give them access to the other signatures stored at the bank. At the same time, the bank can't spend your money, but is able to provide you with the service of keeping a part of the signature extremely secure. If you wish to withdraw a chunk of your large wealth into a spending account, show up in person, and have you and two other banks sign to transfer some of the money out.
Banking and offered services will change with Bitcoin...

That's not exactly it. The idea is that if you fail, it's 100% you giving up trying, and if you succeed, it's 100% you not giving up until you get where you wanted to be. This is entirely a matter of personal choice (unless you die in an accident of course). There's also obvious understanding that success is different for different people. Some people succeed by becoming CEOs or "captains of industry," while others succeed by being successful in their own much lower positions. Rand didn't differentiate success and failure by the level of income or rung on a corporate ladder. The heroes in her books ranged from heads of companies, to train repairmen, to even lowly janitors. All of her examples of failure were just people who have given up trying, and demanded that others, who are still trying, feel sorry for and support them.
As an objectivist and follower of Rand, I show compassion to those struck with unexpected calamity, or those stuck in seemingly inescapable financial and employment situations, who are struggling to get out. I would donate to those people, or teach them ways of getting out of those situations, without being hypocritical about my objectivist views, since those people working in better environments benefits my society and economy as a whole. I.e. I can be charitable, and still have it be for personal reasons. Those who have quit working, quit trying to figure out how to improve themselves, or worse, who refuse to learn how to do it and only complain about their situation in life, I wouldn't have any compassion towards.


The irony is that finance is all about mutual benefit. I give you financial advice in hope that you either buy my product, promote my service, or at least don't make mistakes and affect business or economy negatively. I would want you to succeed, so that I can succeed. That's how all business and finance works (unless it's theft or robbery). So I would be skeptical receiving financial advice from someone who would only advise me on how to give all my money away, or how to live off of others without giving them anything in return.

Some clients (like Mycelium) connect to dedicated servers that store the entire blockchain. In this case, the servers do the job of storing, verifying, transmitting, etc. In this case, you need to trust that the service is giving you correct information about bitcoin balances, though they can't steal your coins, since all transaction signing is still done on your mobile.
 Some clients, such as the Android Wallet (by Schildbach(sp?)) and MultiBit work just like regulat bitcoin nodes, connecting to other random bitcoin nodes, but instead of downloading the entire blockchain with all the info, they only download blockchain headers (tiny) and only information about transactions relevant to the addresses in your wallet. So if you only have one address, instead of downloading all the information out there, they just download info for that one address (and a few random others, just to stay anonymous). In this case, you don't need to trust anyone, since these clients connect to random nodes, and if one of them lies, it will just be found out when the transaction is downloaded from another node.
Sub question: I think clients come with a few seed addresses that the developers try to keep online.

You can access them from any other computer or smartphone. Mobility, basically. Personally, I keep most of mine in offline storage, and carry a few coins on my phone in an Android Wallet app.
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:36:47
Since to send coins you need to sign off on the transactions, you can't do it in a single swipe, unless that swipe can do:
1) Read the receiving address and needed amount
2) Create transaction transferring that amount from your address to the receiving address
3) Sign the transaction
4) Submit it back to the scanner for it to broadcast it, or broadcast it yourself
all in a split second it takes to swipe the card. That's why this idea has been typically proposed as swipe once to get address and amount to send to, check on card to verify they're not stealing way more than they charged you, swipe the second time to give signed transaction.
By the way, this idea has been brought up dozens of times over the last few years. The issue isn't that no one has thought of it, the issue is that, despite everyone thinking of it, no one actually goes out and does it.

That's kinda what I figured. I guess he dropped the multi-sig using computer+phone idea once Trezor showed a lot of promising features (I hope it comes down in price by a lot, though). Would still like to see multi-sig expanded in the main client (or any client) though. There are just so many possibilities for it, and still no implementations (aside from demonstrations at Amsterdam conferences) due to it being so out of sight.

They use different tech. Less chance of both breaking or being hit by a bug at the same time (like Bitcoin fork issue that happened recently).
Due to different adoption rates and market uses (Bitcoin more widely used, Litecoin more of a niche), they will have totally different market exposures. Silk Road closing will not affect Litecoin for example.

Neither would life insurance or retirement investments. Oh wait.
Sure, give credit to the government for coming up with the nice idea, and managing it well for decades, but people in other countries without SSI still manage to get by. Mainly because they know that if they don't save for retirement, they'll be f*cked. Here, people know the government will take care of them with SSI, so we have 75% of the population retiring with less than $100,000 to their name, thanks to blowing all their money on fancy cars, useless gadgets, eating out all the time, videogames, etc. (Incidentally, how old are you and how much have you saved?)
Also, you still have to explain why it's hypocritical to get a service from the government if you were forced to pay for it, even if you are against government.

They lost about -$10,000,000 (doubled their money):
They started buying last summer, when the price was much lower. They bought 1% of all bitcoin to ever exist, meaning
 21mil * 1% = 210,000 BTC
Since they paid a total of $11mil, that means they paid an average of $52.38 per coin. Currently bitcoins are worth $100, so their bitcoin wealth is worth $21mil. So they lost negative $10mil, or put another way, gained $10mil in profit. If bitcoin goes back up to $120 again, that gain will be $15mil profit.
So, who's the dope again?

•sigh• Okay, full disclosure:
First of all, I'm not a "Mycelium Dev." I was hired as a Community Manager and Brand Manager. Later on I came up with the new wallet idea, and the boss liked it so he put me in charge of the wallet developer team to make it happen. At that point I was a Product Manager, while I still did community management stuff.
As Mycelium's "Community Manager," I am sometimes asked to write, or at least review and clean up, press releases for the company. Including when Mycelium and Mass decided to partner, and when Mycelium CEO took it over. In those cases I was given the text, cleaned it up, and posted it as part of my job.
I swear I have zero knowledge about Mass. I didn't know about it when the funds were raised, I was told that Mycelium and Mass may partner and was asked to post some stuff, and then I haven't heard about it since.

Miners can at most sell 3,600 BTC a day. Not all miners sell their BTC, so the total number of mined coins is even less than 3,600 BTC per day. Non-miners trade an average of 75,000 BTC  a day. I doubt miners have much say as to how much to sell their BTC for.

No idea. Bitcoin price could start going up again, keeping up with mining difficulty and continuing to have it be profitable, or it can stay where it is and the difficulty could shoot up. If bitcoin price hadn't spiked up like it did in March, and the price was instead rising slowly and was $22 right now like I thought it would have been, my BTC earnings would have been $11 a month right now, while mining electricity was still $50. So, if everything had been "normal," I would have stopped mining months ago. But the price spiked, so I'm still mining.

1. Multibit or Armory
2. Not yet as far as I know. Some are in the works, but it's hard to choose which currency is worth including. There are issues (sometimes major) with running multiple blockchain databases on the same computer.
3. Depends on the hardware. Some are plug&amp;play, where you buy it blug it in, and it just mines to whatever preset pool it was configured for. Some are just raw hardware you have to install drivers and configure mining software for. I would advise against mining though, as it's pretty much a waste of money right now. You will make way more money just using the cash you would spend on mining hardware buying bitcoin directly.
If you are really adamant about  though, the steps are 1) Go to a list of mining pools, such as on blockchain.info, and pick a pool you like. 2) register an account on the pool, and figure out what domain name and port to connect to. 3) download mining software, such as cgminer or bgfminer. 4) figure out how to set up the miner to work with your particular hardware. Usually you can find that in the readme, or even on the mining pool page. 5) launch the mining software from commandline. Will usually look like C:\cgminer.exe -o miningpool.com:4885 -u someusername -p somepassword -STUFF someASICandhardwarespecific options. And that's it.

Yes, it's the same mechanism. Yes, it will approach an asymptote, dividing bitcoins, then fraction of bitcoins, until it gets to 0.00000001, which it can't divide any more, at which point mining rewards will stop (though I'm wondering, if by then we end up extending the number of decimal points to more than 8, will mining rewards restart again due to possibility of dividing further?)

Dollars have not been backed by metals since at least the 70's. They are just papers manufactured by government, like any other commodity, and are valued and traded in the same way as barrels of oil or a bag of socks.
Gold helped bootstrap dollars by tuying their value to something else that had already previously established value, but now dollars are able to survive on their own, just as part of our collective agreement. Bitcoin did not have any such bootstrapping, and after 2 years ended up just getting this value on it's own spontaneously. I guess in a way it's like baseball or Magic the Gathering cards started out as just collector items and games without any value, and people just started valuing them for whatever reason. For bitcoin, there is an extra benefit that it was specifically designed to work like money, and thus has value in its utility for that function.

Your best bet for that is localbitcoins.com and meeting in person with whomever you agree to trade with there.
Keep in mind that, even if you buy bitcoins on a very-not-anonymous bank-linked exchange, you can just send those bitcoins through a mixing service, such as the one on blockchain.info, and those bitcoins will become completely anonymous again (you'll end up with someone else's coins, with nothing linking them back to you).

You can't manipulate a market where someone actually buys and sells. What, do they expect people to buy or sell Bitcoin, get nothing because it was a fake manipulation, and go, "Oh well.."? And if they manipulate the market by driving the price up or down while people are buying and swelling, that's not manipulating the market. That's buying and selling on the market. Those people have some rather drastic lack of understanding of how trading works.
EDIT: LOL! Here's a perfect example of a dumb statement: the MtGOX admins could be directly manipulating the prices, pushing them further and further up during periods of wild speculation, once more in order to maximize profits based on per-transaction fees
How is $100 worth of BTC traded when a Bitcoin is worth $30 going to bring in a higher fee when $100 worth of BTC is traded when a Bitcoin is worth $130? Are they claiming that higher Bitcoin prices means people who are buying and selling are also making bigger transactions?

Why does it have to be Kenya OR Argentina OR Iran? There are already bitcoiners in Argentina and Iran, using Bitcoin to bypass currency controls. The difference with Kenya is its infrastructure. Iran and Argentina have wired internet, banks, bank wires, and credit card systems. Bitcoin has to compete with established money transfer systems there just like it has to do it in USA, Canada, and Europe. Kenya, however, doesn't have  that infrastructure. A lot of their internet comes through their phones, and most people don't even have bank accounts. They just have cell phones, and are already used to cellphone based payments. It's a tiny step to switch from using cell phones for M-PESA to using cell phones for Bitcoins (just like in Argentina, Iran, and US and Europe, we're hoping to get people to switch from banking and credit cards to just cell phones).
Did you know there were hardly any bitcoin users in Argentina and Iran just a year ago? Or that there were hardly any bitcoin users in America two years ago? Or that there were **no** bitcoin users anywhere in the world just 4 years ago? What is your point? That since there are hardly any users of a technology, that there will never be any users of technology? The article was just stating that Kenya is the perfect place to push Bitcoin adoption into. And, guess what, us bitcoiners have know that for a long time, and there are a lot of bitcoin users actually actively working on getting Bitcoin into Kenya right now. Especially since, on a larger global business scale, Kenya is poised to be the next India for outsourcing. Are you suggesting that, since Kenya doesn't have bitcoin users, that no one should try to get Kenya to have bitcoin users?

Of course!


Well, you can make that argument. I would argue that we want well fed and well educated kids here. Lots of them. It would make the local economy more competitive than the foreign ones, and would allow businesses to save money by hiring employees locally instead of having to search for talent overseas, as we now do with engineers and scientists. Plus, as you said, feeding kids is cheaper than paying extra for security and peace.
 &gt; Work for what? Open-pool resources like forests are owned by the community, or no one.
Well, that's a problem then, isn't it. Tragedy of the Commons and all that. If no one owns it, no one has an incentive to be a good steward of it. And sure, the locals can get affected by externalities, but in that case let the locals, and those who sympathize with them, force the externality producer to pay for it. Don't let the bad guys get away with it under the guise of law and regulation. Hell, let them blow up the factories/mines if the company refuses to listen. As for the children of native Americans, it wasn't their land to sell.
By the way, yes, our regulatory structure is definitely top-down. Regulations are written by experts, who work for the companies being regulated, not by government bureaucrats, who don't understand what they are regulating. You can probably figure out why that's a problem. (Hint - Remember the massive fine that BP had to pay for the oil spill, which was actually a tiny part of their profits, and was paid entirely out of the savings of old retirees who held BP stock, and how that whole fiasco resulted in a complete overhaul of safety procedures and cleanup methods, by which I mean it didn't, at all?)


The price of extra security, for the company and eventually for the company owner's family and friends. The price of lost income from those who boycott their products. The price of losing product due to it being destroyed/robbed while shipping, or at the stores. The price of no one wanting to buy their product at all, because potential customers fear their friends will be pissed at them. None of my friends shop at Chick'fil'A for example. Just as trade is more profitable than war, running a good company is more profitable than being a general asshole.


It requires compromise in almost all things? This seems like a general statement that doesn't actually say anything. Why doesn't objectivism allow compromise? Or what the heck were you trying to say?

Anyone who defends anything with the term "buttcoin" in it is not getting any respect from me, sorry.
Your whole premise starts off with the assumption that they are manipulating the exchange rate. My point is that that's impossible without being very easily found out. SOMEONE is doing the buying and selling. If MtGox were manipulating the exchange rate, they would either 1) not honor fake price-manipulating trades and get found out instantly, or 2) honor those trades and either run out of money very quickly, or just be doing the same thing other rich bitcoiners are doing, i.e. buying and selling on the open market.

Oh, I don't doubt that. The left and the right often completely miss the point of Ayn Rand's books. The right obviously uses them as an example of what they believe in, while completely missing that she was completely against religion, corporatism, and not at all against charity. The left often demonizes her by saying Atlas Shrugged is an example of what the Republican party wants and strives for, while completely missing half of the book that was specifically against corporate lobbyists working with government bureaucrats to screw smaller businesses and make competition unfair. Remember that entire section where a bunch of top railroad executives got together and, with the help of a government bureaucrat, passed an act to reduce competition, and in the process killed the business of a few smaller railroad lines? Dagney was pissed because she wanted to take those companies out using fair business competition, not (sl)easy government acts.
Ayn Rand's Atlass Shrugged was just as much an indictment of everything that the present republican party stands for, as it was of communism. But the right is too stupid to notice, and the left is too blind and prejudiced to realize it.
As for those born into poverty and the entire issue of charity, I think [Penn Jillette said it best](

Those things you mention about gold (minus investment) make up for maybe 5% of its value. The other 95% is all speculation/currency based. Bitcoin has probably about %5 or less of its value based on its utility, too (fungible, impossible to counterfeit, easy to store and transport value, can be used to store and transmit information), and 95% of the rest of its value is also speculation/currency based.

Accordiing to Gavin (lead developer), it is even possible to make Bitcoin have two cryptos at the same time, in case the old one is starting to get weak, and we want to transition to a new crypto without making all the hardware mining and securing bitcoin instantly obsolete. All that would take is good planning and consensus from all users and miners. If the issue is that the crypto is getting weak, and the end result is just a different crypto, I doubt it would be hard convincing people.

Being from Russia/Ukraine, and of a royal descent, my family was rather personally touched by the effects of revolution, both during the initial waves of extermination, and later by the brutal and totally idiotic rule of the power hungry idiots that took control of the country for 80 years. But I don't think revolution will be the outcome here. People didn't revolt to start downloading movies and music illegally. They just decided to ignore the laws and the rulers. I suspect people will not be revolting against government, either, but will just ignore it, and continue to buy whatever they want, however they want, and paying only what they feel like declaring in taxes. So, essentially, I suspect that government will eventually go the way of the RIAA, which is getting increasingly pissed off and hostile, but otherwise completely powerless to do anything.

1) Bitfloor is LLC. Worst thing that can happen if Bitfloor is sues is that no one will ever get any money back. Roman won't be affected.
2) Not many people volunteered to buy a stake to bail Bitfloor out, so it's pretty much where it is whether it wanted to or not. People are still free to sell their Bitfloor debt to others. One guy was offering 5% for it, though, which seems kinda low...
I understand. Looking at it from the "It was worth much less back then" point of view does seem like he made a mistake. But, again, no enough offered back then, and he didn't have enough of his own money to cover it. His options were limited. And, as I said, the situation may not be as dire, since it's not the price of bitcoin that matters, but volume. Volume has gone up considerably recently (check the 30 day volume on Bitfloor, multiply that by 0.4%*2, and you'll get a better sense of what kind of situation Bitfloor is actually in).

Difference between typical online wallets, like Instawallet (or even wallets on exchanges) and blockchain.info is that online wallets store **and execute** all your keys, coins, and transactions online in their servers, while blockchain.info just serves a copy of a locally-executed browser-based bitcoin wallet client to your computer, which is executed completely on your own machine, and all bitcoin things happen in your browser locally (creating private keys, sending coins, etc). The local browser-based wallet gets encrypted with your password before it gets sent back to blockchain.info for storage, so they have no access to your keys, passwords, or transaction history. Essentially, blockchain.info is the equivalent of having a Bitcoin-QT wallet that you use locally, and then encrypt and upload to some online storage service so you can download it and use it elsewhere (except they store all the blockchain data for you too, so you don't have to download 8 gigs of data every time). Benefit is that, unlike other online wallets, blockchain.info never gets a copy of your private keys or passwords, so if they get hacked, the hackers will get the same thing blockchain.info has: a bunch of heavily encrypted files with no record of what's what. Just make sure to use a very strong password, and you should be safe from bruteforce attacks should blockchain.info get hacked (or if you're paranoid, get Armory)

The way he talks about it also makes it sound as if he believes Bitcoin is a product or idea that may or may not be adopted, or something that can be either improved or dismissed. Bitcoin is a honey badger currency: it doesn't give a f*. Despite any economists wishes or claims of how it should be, it will just be the way it is, and likely continue to be adopted and used despite protests that it can't be.


The problem is that the currency we use here isn't an open market. Ben is in charge of running a monopoly, and for many there is no free market choice as to whether to keep using the currency and be screwed when a mistake is made, or use something else. Libertarians are pissed specifically because they fear he is screwing with and risking something that doesn't specifically belong to Bernankie (i.e. their savings accounts and other aspects of the economy).


Last time we had a screwup as big as '08, we were still on the gold standard, and our debt was practically nothing compared to what it is now. The Fed raising interest rates to halt inflation problems is a solution, but it would be akin to a credit card company calling someone with a huge loan and telling them they are doubling or tripling their rates. Republicans and other politicians will go absolutely nuts! It may be allowed to go through, but it won't be pretty.


Oh it's waaaay deeper than just "I don't like regulations because I want freedoms and free markets." Did you ever look into who it is exactly that writes regulations, lobbies for them to pass, and is then responsible for doing the actual regulating? It's not pretty, and I don't think there's a way to fix the problem.


The thing that is wrong is that voters don't vote like that. Voters vote to get more government programs, thus add to the spending, and then vote to keep taxes the same, or reduce them, thus not actually pay for the things they asked for previously. So the government's only option is to borrow the money to keep providing those services. And the money that's borrowed often comes from other countries, which the voters gladly borrow from, but don't care about when the bill comes due (how many Americans are concerned that Chinese people get their monthly debt payments? Were all nationalists here). As a result, you end up with runaway borrowing followed by either sudden and severe cuts, or collapse, like we had in Greece, Cyprus, and some local governments here in the States. Thanks to voters always voting in their own interest (give me free stuff), such outcomes are pretty much inevitable in the long run.
 The libertarian idea of using currency such as gold or Bitcoin is based on the hope that, without being able to borrow unrestricted, and then just inflating the debt away, governments will be literally forced to make sure they are spending what they actually have.


I do. But no one in class asked, why should I be forced to spend on any available crap to secure my value, instead of only paying for things I believe are worth spending on? Why is the tech market such a booming one when it exists in a state of enormous deflation? (Your USD can get you a much better phone two months from now than it can get you now, yet people line up to buy new gadgets right away) Why will people sit on their cash and not spend it when it's deflating, but will not sit on their cash and will spend it when it's sitting in a high interest savings account, doing essentially the same thing? Why is it ok that lower income people don't have the skills or resources to invest in socks, and can only save their money, and only they are the one subjected to the 2% to 3% inflation "tax" that us middle and upper income types can easily avoid by investing in mutual funds? How much damage has the last century of inflationary policies have done to our collective society, when we all live in a world where it is better to borrow money and repay it later, maybe, as opposed to what inflation would teach us, which is that it's better to save up to buy something? (Considering the collective debt issues... :(   )
It's questions like these that made me a lot less sure of myself when it comes to my economic education and beliefs.

I actually really despise conservatives. You may be a "conservative" as a political label, but what you did with bitcoin was not conservative at all. The people making fun of Bitcoin because they didn't understand it or were uncomfortable with it were conservative. You were part of the progressive group that embraced change and went on to experiment with this unknown, no doubt at least in part hoping it will bring on massive changes for the better. Right now, conservatives are the people who want to keep things as is (keep government as is, keep social programs as is, keep taxes and expenditures as is, i.e. Democrats and many Republicans). Progressives are the ones who wish to change government, whether that means reduce regulations, privatize more programs, etc.
The reason I despise conservatives is because they don't like change, and always stand in the way of it. USSR Soviets were conservatives, as are religious fundamentalists, homophobes, racists, etc. This label should be applied more appropriately.

Bitcoin is a consensus network. In other words, everyone you transact bitcoin with agrees to follow a very specific set of rules. Anyone is free to change anything in that open--source code, but all that would mean is that they will create a different set of rules, and no one else's wallets will recognize or accept their transactions any more.
Regarding changes, they happen when people submit ideas, discuss ideas, submit code, test code, debuut code, and finally propose the code to be included in the final production version of the client. If enough people decide that the code is a good addition, it gets included in the "official" and other clients. If people think the addition is a bad idea, it may get included in some clients, but is ignored by all others, and eventually just dies off. Due to this, typically only things that have near 100% consensus get added, and that means that they are typically things that help pretty much all bitcoin users.

There's no such thing as a Bitcoin remitting company. You exchange currency locally into Bitcoin, and someone else exchanges currency locally from Bitcoin.

In my situation, even when Bitcoin was worth $15, it could fluctuate as much as 20% without affecting me, since I only needed to spend at most 4% of it at any one time. A lot of that was due to me living **way** below my means (I'm a cheapskate). It has also been growing a very nice buffer the entire time, too. Pretty much the only reason I don't use it exclusively is because I still get enormous savings from tax deferred retirement savings accounts.

Difficulty is extremely hard to predict right after a difficulty change, because you are working with a small set of very random data. If the difficulty just changed, and you base the next difficulty change only on the block immediately following the change, if that block takes 60 minutes to confirm (which happens often), your next difficulty estimate will be a 600% jump.
As time goes by and you get more data samples, with the average of that sample approaching the 10 minutes it's supposed to be at, then you will start to get a clearer estimate of the difficulty jump. So, the closer we get to the next increase, the better the estimate.

The seed for the 2 factor authentication doesn't change, so maybe there could be something that unlocks the wallet by asking for both a password and the 2factor key, an then comparing the password and the key to the password and the seed+time stored in the file. Would have to be a custom decryption software, and it would still help with keyloggers, but it wouldn't protect against things that scan memory.
Maybe even have the seed be encrypted with the password, then once the password decrypts the seed, use the seed to compa... yeah, just realized that if someone has your password, and they know where the seed is stored, they'll get the seed anyway. NEVER MIND.

I believe CampBX accepts money orders, so you can use that if you don't want to use bank accounts. With spending them, I try to use Gyft as much as I can. As for selling if the price starts to drop, the best advice I can give is don't try to time the market. Something like 70% to 80% of professional traders screw it up, and if they do it professionally, I wouldn't bother as a hobby. My method is to just have enough bitcoins so that if they drop in value, I can still have enough. For example, if I have $10,000 worth of bitcoins, and need to spend $500 a month, if that $10,000 drops to $7,000, I can still spend my $500 without any problems.
Personally, I move all my income into bitcoins when I get paid, using Coinbase, then I use Gyft or bitcoin directly for whatever I can, and credit cards for everything else. At the end of the month, I sell however many bitcoins I need to pay off my creditcards, again through Coinbase, or through localbitcoins.com. It's not perfect, and I'm still relying on banks (especially since my paycheck gets direct-deposited into one, and my student loan payments get withdrawn from one), but it's getting easier and easier to move away from that system.
As for asking for lower fees on localbitcoins for trading in cash, bitcoin is more valuable than cash, since it can move faster, so sellers have to charge a premium. When I did localbitcoin trades, there were times (too often) when I would sell 5 bitcoins for some amount of cash, but by the time I managed to get that cash deposited into my exchange (2 to 3 days), I could only buy 4.5 bitcoins due to price increase, losing quite a bit on the trade.

The reason the current all time high is at $230 is because there are people offering to sell it at $230, and people not willing to pay more than $230. I am sure you can find plenty that will take $270 from you to give you a bitcoin, but you would be the only one silly enough to pay that much, when there are plenty of sellers who would be happy to sell to you at $230. So, even if you paid $270 for it, everyone else will look at you like this-&gt;  O.o, and continue to buy and sell it at $230.

Look at Bitcoin Armory offline storage. That's an example of how this idea is being used.
In short, you can have an offline device (either netbook, or hardware wallets not in development) that stores your private keys that are generated from a single seed, and an online device, such as a wallet software or online wallet connected to the web, that uses that same seed to generate only public addresses, without a way for private addresses to be exposed to the network. When spending money, your online device creates a transaction, then you use your offline device to sign it, and the online device to transmit it. This way, your private keys never get exposed to the network, and thus aren't vulnerable to hacks or viruses. And the reason this can work is because both devices use the same seed and are both aware of all possible public keys that can be generated from it.

Not necessarily. Economics isn't a hard science, and this path of understanding how things work could just be different from someone else's. Both pathways still work; the difference is what kind of issues and problems they create.
Besides, new things do get invented that the old ideas can no longer be applied to. Krugman did famously state that the internet won't have much more impact on business than a fax machine.

Two things:
1) If MtGox were liquidated, their assets would amount to a few servers. In that situation, Bitfloor is just as at risk as MtGox, i.e. their business is running and seems stable as long as it's running, but there's nothing backing it other than day-to-day business. The forced loan, while sucks, doesn't really affect Bitfloor's business as it is now, other than to cut into its profits.
2) What is the difference between buying a stake in Bitfloor, and just having it pay back the debt the way it is doing now? I.e. if I was to buy a 100BTC stake in Bitfloor, I would hope that Bitfloor would make enough profits to cover that 100BTC stake. Otherwise it's a losing investment. If I just have a 100BTC "loan" with Bitfloor, I would hope that Bitfloor would make enough profits to cover that 100BTC "loan," otherwise it would be a loss for me too. I don't really see a difference. Also, I personally don't have money tied up with Bitfloor, but instead bought someone else's "loan," which is also effectively me buying a stake in it, and making whoever held the original amount solvent.

No arms race? Are you suggesting that each country, or even each county/municipality, have it's own alt-coin? Because if they all still mine the same Bitcoin, governments will compete to get the most blocks, just so they can get the most money for their own citizens. More specifically, we would have superpowers, like Russia, China, and USA, mining, and possibly even subsidizing mining by taxing people and mining at a loss, just so they can have a higher proportion of the blocks and more bitcoin revenue than the other two superpowers.

The paradigm shift is that if I have millions in my bank account, that's plainly visible and can be traced and confiscated, or I have to carry millions on me, which is nearly impossible to do across borders. With Bitcoin, that's not an issue. I'm nowhere even near there though, but I hope to have that as an option.
Regarding high volatility, if my net worth keeps jumping between $2mil and $4mil, that shouldn't affect my purchase of a $2 tube or toothpaste, or even a $3,000 plane ticket. My savings account is currently in bitcoin, too, and the fact that it fluctuates 50% doesn't really affect me when I only need to spend, say, 2% of that a month.
True, governments will get really upset when they see their tax revenue dwindling from too much of this. Just look at Russia, where tax evasion is a serious problem. However, if we use Russia as an example, it seems that governments will just try to look for other sources of money they need to maintain control (i.e. pay for police and military). In Russia's case it's corporate crony capitalism, where corporations are stuffing the politician's pockets, that's starting to border on fascism. Honestly, that's a far more serious problem for you all to deal with than the problem of "bitcoin is made illegal" for the rest of us :(
Is it, at all, in any way possible that the scenario could unfold where:
1. More and more people more into bitcoin, and start to just not care about certain laws (just as kids don't care about copyright),
2. Governments start to try to clamp down on bitcoin in the same way and with the same result as they have on copyright, drugs, guns, etc. issues, which turn out to be ineffective
3. Governments get starved of tax revenue, and turn to other sources, such as the Russia example (or just more extreme of the bs we have with US lobbyists and SuperPACs)
4. Combinations of 2 and 3 piss enough people that they either emigrate elsewhere, withdraw further, or just revolt
5. Big governments/countries either simply fold, or slowly convert into corporate-owned land-masses, where the corporation that was stuffing political pockets the most sees the government it was funding getting way too weak, and just decides to take over completely.
In short, as shit hits the fan around the world, people keep moving around until "the powers that be" just fall one by one? Yeah, it's not very likely, at least not globally, but bitcoin does make it a hell of a lot easier...

That's true, higher fees get priority, but only if there is competition. I believe the hard limit is about 5mb per block. Currently there is a soft limit on blocks, but we are still not using it mall up. So even if you don't include any fees in your transactions, your low priority transaction will still fit, and at worst you'll have to wait for two blocks instead of one if one of the blocks gets solved by someone who doesn't take free transactions at all.

But bitcoin is a money transfer mechanism, which can do USD &lt;&gt; BTC &lt;&gt; USD. Eventually, the only difference between sending money through Bitcoin and something like PayPal will be that, with PayPal type transfers you have to make sure that both the sender and receiver are using the same system, whereas with Bitcoin transfers, the sender and receiver can use whatever exchanges or transfer businesses they want.

It won't go up any time soon, until it suddenly does. No one predicted it suddenly rising from $2.50 after the long slide, or up from $9 last August, and especially from $15 to $266 this spring.

My opinion is mainly tainted by the story of when OWS started receiving thousands of dollars in donations. They didn't really know how to handle the money, so a few accountants from NY University volunteered to help them as treasurers and accountants. After a while those volunteers who do know about money just quit and left due to all the stupid bullshit and infighting amongst the various groups. In the end, they protested riches, and ended up screwing themselves as soon as they got any riches themselves.
That, plus they often seem to be attacking the wrong targets. That whole "If you want to keep corporations out of government, then keep government out of corporations" thing is really actually true, but really goes against what they believe in.

It's actually 200 if you pay for the 150EUR price using Bitcoin, but yeah, not cheap. We actually wanted to make it free, supported only by vendors and sponsors, but the venue was rather expensive, so we didn't have the option. Good news is that we plan to keep all leftover profits and put them towards another convention elsewhere in the world, which would likely have much cheaper tickets thanks to use already having cash, and not freaking out about putting so much money down to start it from scratch.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:25:04
Yeah, this makes sense. It's what I used to do through LocalBitcoins. I stopped, because due to it taking a while for cash to transfer into the exchange, I would lose out a bit when bitcoin would rise. The most profitable option for me so far has been to hold everything in bitcoin. Though I am being very risky, and they are getting a guaranteed 3% no matter which way Bitcoin goes.

Sadly, P2Pool does not have pool operators, and works completely distributed, like bitcoin. So the only people to contact to get money back is each individual miner who mined at P2Pool and got a share of the fee.
@_date: 2013-06-05 19:12:34
Sadly, you can't get around AML. However, and IANAL, just as Fellowtraveler who explained this is not a lawyer, but what would be possible is for someone big to deposit a big chunk of USD with a trusted party, following all the AML/KYC procedures, and then once that party issues certificates backed by that large chunk of USD, people will be able to send those certificates back and forth as if they were cash, without any sort of restrictions or ways of tracking them. As he claims, it's like the Federal Reserve having no liability regarding what people do with cash after it distributes it. Then you'll be able to trade your USD for USD-backed certificates with friends or P2P or whatever, similarly to Ripple.
So, in short, it's not perfect, but then if USD was perfect, we wouldn't need BTC :D

And ironically that makes you more of a liberal/libertarian/liberty-whatever. The republican party used to be liberal, and Democrats (Dixiecrats) were conservatives. Then they flipped. I think the parties may start to flip again (perhaps with liberal factions of Democrats joining liberal factions of Republicans to become a libertarian party, with the remaining conservatives in both parties turning into something else).
Curiously, I went to a Ron Paul rally (more out of curiosity, since I'm registered Democrat), and the people I stayed in line with were pro-gun military-types, who were blasting the Fed (obviously), taxes, and government infringing on liberties, but most of the conversations I've overheard were them blasting the hell out of homophobes and complaining how gay marriage should never have been illegal in the first place. It was weird hearing this coming from what would otherwise look like a bunch of camo-wearing rednecks.

I had the same issue. It gets stuck at 1BTC, no matter what amount you want to send. You ca actually send whatever amount you want to the address it gives you, it's just that your donation won't be registered, and you won't get any badges. Coinbase needs to look into it.

Problem is, coin typically means something round. I think a bit ("I need 20 millibits, or nanobits" and eventually 1bitcoin being just a bit) could easily evolve as part of normal vernacular. We reuse words all the time. Plus if you've seen a lot of sci-fi movies and anime, they use things like chips/chits, credits/creds, etc all the time, even if what they are drading aren't exactly credit-based or chips.
In short, though, languages evolve, and although bit may not become the normal short-hand for bitcoin, I think there's a good chance for it (for example, cell has become a shorthand for cellular phone, and in some other countries they have even forgone the "phone" part altogether, calling their cellphones whatever their language translation of "cellular" is)
@_date: 2013-05-22 06:06:05
So, if I understand this correctly...
Bitcoin turns the whole internet into your personal checking/savings account, while BT+OT turns the whole internet into your personal clearinghouse and loan settlement network
Or, said another way:
You use Bitcoin like an equity network, i.e. to store, transmit, and settle value, and BT+OT like a liability network, i.e. to store, transmit, and settle debt.
Is this right?

A gift card in a specific company's books is profit for the company. A general VISA gift card is profit for nobody.
I.e. when you buy a gift card for some retail store, the store gets the money, and can record that as profit, since later on all that will happen is their accounts will exchange the money for an equivalent value of some clothing or item. If you buy a VISA gift card, the money is help by VISA, doesn't actually belong to VISA (meaning it's a liability for them), and they only make a profit on the fee for selling the card.

1) check  It will tell you what exchange markets there are, and how many buyers and sellers are willing to buy and sell. Typically, if you trade under $100,000, there''s enough liquidity that it shouldn't be a problem. With time that amount will go up.
2) It's fairly idiot proof. Addresses actually have a built-in CRC check of sorts that makes it extremely difficult to typo and address. The first rule of using bitcoin is don't use it with PayPal. The second rule is keep your bitcoins on your own computer or device. If you must keep it online, use blockchain.info. The third rule is use a good password to secure it. If you have a lot of bitcoins, keep them in offline storage, such as on paperwallets (bitaddress.org) or on an offline computer (bitcoinarmory). Soon you'll also be able to keep them on a dedicated device, like a Trezor, at which point, just don't use PayPal to trade your coins, and you'll be fine.
3) Absolutely. Why? Don't think of Bitcoin as a country's currency. Think of it as a share in a company, and the entire Bitcoin economy is the company. Some business creates a new more secure bitcoin wallet, or some business starts a service making it easier for merchants to use bitcoin? Bitcoin price, like share price, goes up. Favorable bitcoin news comes out? Bitcoin price goes up. Bad news comes out" price goes down. All pretty much same as with a company stock. And the potential for this "company" is enormous!

You are supposed to keep track of it yourself. They just don't care for small amounts such as those used for travel, but if you were to buy $10,000 worth of EUR, and then come back and sell it for $50,000, yeah, they'll want to know and will want you to file taxes on it (whether you will do it or not is another question).
When I worked for an international candy company, we would buy our stuff from factories in Hungary and Spain and pay them Euros. We would have to record that transaction in our account books in dollar terms, despite the actual exchange being in Euros. We would also have to record how much the USD price was per EUR when we converted USD to UER, and record any capital gains on the purchase as well (e.g. if we bought $50k worth of EUR to buy $50k worth of candy, but then got lucky with USD going up and bought the same amount of candy for $45k, we'd have to book the $5k  gain)

It's not data mining, it's verification that all accounting entries that went through bitcoin in the last ~10 minutes are correct, that all money is legit, and to create a nearly impossible to forge signature to sign off on all these transactions.

Sure, it's unstable, but in a generally UP direction, as opposed to generally down one. People who have experienced inflation/hyperinflation are much less likely to trust a currency controlled by the government that has proven to cause said inflation before. Besides, with bitcoin, fluctuations decrease as adoption increases. With local currencies, fluctuations happen at the whim (mistakes) of whoever is in power, and can happen at any time.




It's just general business insider knowledge. Kenya has a lot of benefits for outsourcing, and now even more than India, since wages in India have been skyrocketing and turnover got really high. Indians are very highly educated, and they know it, so they won't work in phone support for long. The only thing that was holding Kenya back was lack of good internet. They only had satellite until very recently, while India had fiber since the dot com era. Now that Kenya has fiber, too, a lot of companies are looking into it. Here's an article I hastily found while googling 
In summary, Kenya is good because they have low wages, they speak English fluently and without much of an accent (unlike Indians), they are very business friendly and have very good tax rates, and they also have a large educated workforce. No other country has a combination of all these, at least not to that extent. Kenya is such a good candidate that there are even articles and business cases about it being taught in business schools now.

I had a contract where a business needed to borrow some money from me. We wrote up a coontract, saying "I, Person A with Address_A will borrow money from Person B with Address_B, with such and such terms and legalese." Then they signed that document using Person_A bitcoin address (it works same as PGP signatures), and I signed that document, along with their signature, using Address_B. Then we published the contract in public where everyone can see it, and everyone can verify that the signatures below indeed came from Address_A and Address_B. Then I send them their loan from my Address_B to their Address_A, and they made periodic repayments from their Address_A to my Address_B. In this way, everyone can see that we made this contract, everyone can see that I honored it by giving them the full amount of the loan, and everyone could see that they were repaying the loan as agreed upon. Except no one actually knew who we were, other than forum usernames. So we had a contract that was arbitrated on with the bitcoin system itself, which neither of us could break, since it's very easy to see and prove if one of us does. The only thing courts or arbitration would be needed for in this case is to settle things should things go bad.
This is actually the simplest example of what can be done. You can also assign property or stock shares to individual fractions of bitcoin, and trade those bitcoins as if they were contractual representations of that property or stock (look into colored coin), use multisignature transactions to set up escrows, etc.

I never said that Litecoin and Bitcoin should be used for transactions at the same time. I don't expect Litecoin to reach that level of adoption. But you said it yourself, a second currency to diversify into can help mitigate issues from software bugs. If issues with SHA-256 arise, people who diversified will still have scrypt to rely on. Also, you can't diversify risk by just adding more people. That will reduce volatility, but the underlying Bitcoin risk, the one that's actually dependent on Bitcoin and the market it's used in, is still there. The only way to diversify from that risk is to use something other than Bitcoin, that uses different technology, and is used in different markets. Since I doubt Litecoin will get adopted anywhere near as much as Bitcoin, Litecoin is pretty much guaranteed to be in different markets from Bitcoin.

In other words, if someone uses a keyloger on your computer and steals your password, you'll be safe, but if someone uses a keyloger and steals your password AND hacks blockchain.info and steals your encrypted data file, they can use your password to unlock your file without needing the 2-factor part.

What is this nickel based alloy? This flux insulation property is due to gold having the highest "speed" at generating eddy currents opposing to alternating magnetic fields, which can counteract and suppress the flux from escaping. So, for example, to build such a flux insulator using aluminum, you would need to make the aluminum thickness probably 10x larger than you could with gold (not sure of the actual x), meaning the device that uses such tech would have to be enormous compared to what it would be if it used gold.

Yes, of course it's about ideology. Bitcoin is about ideology. And convenience, and saving on fees, and avoiding fraud. Bitcoin100 doesn't hide the fact that it does this to promote Bitcoin, both as a benefit to charities, and as a benefit to current bitcoin stakeholders. So thank you for stating the publicly obvious. And sure, it's easy to just convert the money into USD and give it away no questions asked, but how does that benefit the charity (beyond the initial donation)? They miss out on another donation option, more publicity, future donations, and all the benefits that Bitcoin provides, like low fees and no chargebacks. "Teach a man to fish" and all that.

To keep from disrupting things, new code gets added to clients, and is set to activate once a block number in the blockchain hits some threshold. For example, 6 months or a year from now. As more and more people download or upgrade their clients with new ones that contain that dormant code, the updates propagate through the users. Once bitcoin blockchain hits that set number, the new code gets automatically switched on, and the entire network switches over to the new protocol. Typically this happens without anyone even noticing anything, other than some new features becoming available. This actually happened this past Spring (or was it last Spring?), but wasn't really noticed or reported on.
For non-protoocol core updates, such as the new bitcoin merchant communications protocol that will be released soon, since that's not actually part of the bitcoin protocol itself, and just a feature that works parallel to bitcoin, some developers just add it as an extra feature on top of their wallet software, and other developers, who think it's a good idea, copy it and add it to theirs. In this case, if someone doesn't want to use it, they don't have to, as it won't affect their ability to use bitcoin in any way.

I believe the great majority of people can only get 1% to -2%, since savings accounts pay abysmal rats nowadays...


If a poor person only has access to his own cash, and puts away $1,000, at current inflation rates that amount will only be worth $820 in ten years. It's not much better if the person is saving a few bucks off of every paycheck.


I don't believe we're on the brink of any inflation problems, either, actually. But Europe didn't believe it was going to be hit with the Euro problems either. We may be all perfectly fine, with no problems on the horizon, until we are not. 


I would argue that the 2008 crisis and the sub-prime mortgage screwup was caused by a culture of borrowing, fostered by inflationary policy, which was then exacerbated by deregulation, which in effect was releasing a bunch of untrained bankers onto the country without them having had the opportunity to learn how to properly manage risk.


Just as it was oil lobbyists that wrote regulations that failed during the BP oil spill, coal lobbyists that write regulations regarding acceptable environmental impacts resulting in polluted rivers, etc. etc. etc. Governments don't pay well. The typical pattern is, regulators get hired by the government, they learn all the ins and outs of the regulatory environment they work in, then they are snatched away, hired by the businesses they used to regulate for a much higher pay, and help push through or avoid regulations they themselves used to be responsible for. It's like this in practically every industry, is why government seems so incompetent. Short of raising salaries, this pattern is impossible to stop (and raising salaries is impossible, because "Government spending too high! Rabble rabble rabble!"). ***And that's why people who used to be liberal democrats become libertarians.**


I'm aware of this, and, thinking about it, that may actually be an even worse problem. It's basically the Greece situation: Do we default on the 10% (or whatever) owed to China, and risk a war or tensions? Do we default on people's social benefits we promised but can no longer pay for and cause riots and economic collapse? Or do we ramp up inflation to make the debt slowly go away, and piss everyone off in the process?


How much of America's economic stability depends on this btw? I.e. what effect on America's debt and economy would it have if other countries abandoned the dollar as their reserve currency, as China, India, and others are starting to?


I think we may be talking about two different borrowings here. I was talking about government borrowing, and the debt ceiling being raised every time (which is a stupid concept to begin with) suggests that there isn't any restriction on such. The hope is that, with governments being limited to spend only what they can tax and what they can borrow from banks that actually sits there...


It's not a force, it's a culture. Compare what happens to someone if you give them a bitcoin, versus if you give them a dollar. They'll hold on to the bitcoin because they quickly learn that they can get a bit more for it if they just wait. That itself forces a culture of saving. A dollar is something to be spent. With inflating currency, the savings mentality just gets slowly eroded, and with easily available debt, where future payments are easier and easier to pay, things just get (have gotten) worse.




Why is this not an answer to the worry that people will only hoard in a deflationary economy, instead of spending on things as soon as they come out?


Before the 2008 crash and subsequent Fed rate reductions, a typical high interest savings account could get you 3% to 4% (e.g. ING Direct, Ally Bank, etc). What was the inflation rate in the mid 2000's?


A lot of people are uneducated, and don't trust the wild swings in the stock market. They have no money, time, or resources to learn, So they just put away $20 or so at a time into a jar or a savings account. Note, also, that a Vanguard mutual fund requires an initial deposit of about $3,000 to open an account, and most stock/bond/ETF trades through a brokerage charge you $4 to $7 per trade. Not something poor people would be enticed by.


Which is the crux of the entire government problem I'm talking about :)




Sub-prime mortgages are what's wrong with an economy that promotes investment. It's not investment that's the problem, it's the scale of it. It's investing in things you really shouldn't, just because it's so cheap to, which in the end leads to periods of stability, followed by massive bubbles/crashes.
I'll just say that, what happened in US during 2008 did not really affect Canada much. Reason is because Canada doesn't have a house culture, they have an rent culture. There are no zero downpayment mortgages, meaning people have to save a lot to buy a house, and mortgage interest is also not tax deductible. So there wasn't much of a housing bubble to crash. Ditto for many European countries. America, on the other hand, has the "American Dream," which includes "a house and a picket fence." Thanks to that house dream, housing is heavily subsidized, and is also a cause of many of our problems. Work force is locked in place and can't easily move based on changing market conditions. People lock themselves into life-long loans for way more property than they typically need. Banks go crazy with lending out more than the market can sustain. This is a somewhat different problem from just "inflation", though, but you get the idea.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:56:20
If you were to tie proof of work to some other useful function, you would only succeed in tying bitcoin to something that may or may not be useful or valuable in the future. It would be as if gold suddenly found an enormous use in some life-prolonging medicine, which would make the value of gold skyrocket (causiing chaos in the market), and then later on we found some way of prolonging life even more, without the use of gold, making the value of gold plummet (causing yet more chaos in the market). Bitcoin's proof of work makes it a pure money with no ties to anything else.
@_date: 2013-01-30 20:08:14
Not exactly. In your example, it would be like having to download other people's credit card statements that include list of transactions for buying porn, as well as embeded messages about porn, and actually store those on your own computer, just to use the VISA. Which is kinda what every bitcoiner does whenever they download the official client and the blockchain that comes with it, since the blockchain file itself is storing those transactions and unrelated messages entered by miners (e.g. Eligius miner used to add a lot of Christian religious messages to every block they mined/found)

According to the article, M-PESA has fees ranging from 1% to 10%. That's not cheap for people who may live on a few dollars a day.
So, the benefits are:
* Lower fees
* Does't rely on local unstable currency
* Doesn't rely on third party trust. If M-PESA goes under, so does everyone's money. Bitcoins can be stored right on the phone, with a safe backup somewhere else.
* Private and anonymous. M-PESA knows and can publish your financial info, or have it stolen, which, considering the corruption there, can be a bad thing. (avoids extortion, excessive taxation/bribes, etc)
* Global. It's not easy to send someone money into M-PESA from overseas, but that's not a problem with bitcoin. Likewise, it's not easy for someone from Kenya to order foreign products using M-PESA.
* Primes the country for outsourcing. Kenya is the next target for outsourcing after India, and may be even bigger than India in that respect. Having them use bitcoin will make it much easier and much cheaper for companies to pay the employees, as opposed to importing dollars/euros, converting them to local currency, transferring it into M-PESA, and then sending out payments. Think how much of those employee's pay will dissappear just to pay for currency transfer and exchange fees.
* Deflationary. If a lot of Kenyans adopt bitcoin soon, they will see their collective wealth rise as the rest of the world comes to slowly adopting it too.

If your credit card is compromised and someone uses it to send money to someone else, the credit card company can pull that money back. It's called chargebacks. With bitcoin, once the money is sent, it's gone, and you can't get it back.

From what I understand, I can create a receipt (IOU or whatever) for whatever reason, and can give it to anyone, letting the OT server know that I've done it, and let anyone holding it verify that they have it. I can then tie those IOUs to whatever I want, like BTC, colored coins, USD, whatever. Kinda like how you can deposit USD into MtGox, and then trade using MtGox vouchers, except in this case the person creating the vouchers and the place storing/keeping track of them are two separate entities. So, say, if you send me $100, I can hold that $100 for you, and give you $100-backed vouchers in return (or I can issue vouchers backed by my own $100 if you trust me). Then you and everyone else can go all around the web, trading or daytrading BTC or whatever else for that $100-worth of vouchers, and when someone wants to finally cash out, they can come back to me and trade those vouchers back for the $100USD or  portion thereof. 
Or if I'm a company trying to sell shares of stock, I can likewise create certificates, and sell those to raise money, using the OT server as sort of a recording/brokerage entity that can keep track of it (the stock will be traded P2P instead of through OT, with OT just signing off on the trade).
Or I can pretend to be PayPal, letting people open OTPal accounts, where they can deposit money, then send that money to anyone they want - in actuality sending OTPal certificates - and then someone else can cash out by exchanging the OTPal certificate back for cash.
Fellowtraveler who created this thing can explain it much.. uh... much more accurately. Probably not much better, since I'm still wrapping my head around it, as have everyone else for the last few years XD

Godamnit, I wrote up a large reply, only to have my browser crash...
1) LLC does not protect you from criminal activities. Madoff was outright scamming and stealing. Bitfloor did no such thing (though some might argue that leaving the wallet open the way they did was criminal negligence). And, actually, "Being an LLC means he cannot go to jail for failing to honour liabilities" is exactly what the point of a Limited Liability Corporation is to begin with: it's so that people can take out huge loans in the corporation's name, and then not be liable for them personally if their business fails.
2) I'll do the math for you. Bitfloor charges 0.4% per trade, on both sides. Their 30 day volume is 70,000BTC. So:
70,000 * 0.4% * 2 = 560BTC profit per month.
25,000 / 560 = 44.64 month = 3.72 years.
So, assuming nothing changes, and that they use all their profit to repay, they'll be able to do it in about 4 years. However, Bitcoin volume overall has been rising, AND Bitfloor has been taking trade volume from MtGox. Currently, if we only take MtGox (volume of 2.25Mil) and Bitfloor (volume of 70k) into consideration, Bitfloor holds 70,000 / (70,000 + 2,250,000) = 3% of the market. Is it possible for Bitfloor to steal enough business from MtGox to get 6% or 9% of the market? If yes, then Bitfloor can repay in 1/2 to 1/3 the time. Is it possible that the overall volume of bitcoin exchanges grows due to increased interest in Bitcoin, or due to a crash in price resulting in a selling frenzy? If that overall volume goes up by 10% or 20%, that's another 10% to 20% reduction in the time to pay the loan back.
So, worst case, if nothing happens, is 4 years. I believe things will continue to improve considerably, so it'll be considerably less than 4 years (I'm even fine with 2). And the price per bitcoin has really nothing to do with it. Volume is all that matters.
(Obviously, worse case scenario is some idiot tries to sue Bitfloor, Bitfloor shuts down, the idiot gets nothing due to LLC protection, and everyone else loses out on the money they were owed).

Newness, and use. If you look at the price of USD compared to a basket of goods or other world currencies, it has actually fluctuated wildly over the last year, typically bouncing up and down about 3%, and even as much as 7% this past spring. But we just don't notice it, because we see everything in USD, and just see prices of goods changing a bit. Plus, when a currency is used extensively, prices tend to be "sticky," meaning vendors would rather leave something that costs $5 marked as $5, instead of changing the price stickers all the time, which masks these constant value fluctuations even more.

Your "anti-intellectual" comment caught my eye. Master's in Business Finance w/ concentration in Global Economics here (Robert H. Smith School of Business). I learned same stuff you did, and no doubt went through the same economics lessons. I also thought the same way you did, both about the fundamentals of economics and about supposed librarian opinions. Turns out those lessons were not entirely correct, and the academic economists we hold in high regard can also make mistakes. Paul Krugman's arguments against Bitcoin, for example, are based on him not understanding what Bitcoin actually is, and are so misguided as to be almost embarrassing. Ben Bernanke's quantitative easing, and central banks in general, are not disliked because they are the devil, but because they are people who also make mistakes, and because they may be too naive thinking they can contact the money supply after expanding it once inflation finally sets in (expand to help the economy, can't contact because the rest of the politicians will bitch about making our foreign debt worse off). The idea that hoarding and deflation are automatically bad starts to sound questionable when you consider other things as well. What you and I learned is not entirely wrong, but it's not the whole picture, either, and when you get more of the picture, things start to feel very uncomfortable...

Big issue that is missed is that Esperanto doesn't really give any advantages over one's own native language. I can communicate in my native language just as well as I would in Esperanto, had I took the time to learn it. Likewise for everyone else using their own different languages. And language barriers can be overcome either by burdensome translators, or by using any other language that is universally used, such as English. So, besides being harder to learn, there are still no linguistic advantages that Esperanto provides over native languages. On the other hand, Bitcoin offers advantages over other currencies that no other currencies provide, such as privacy, p2p transactions, resilience, security, and it's digital nature (storing private keys in code, backups, etc). That's not a feature I can get simply by replacing dollars with some other country's currency. A better currency analog to Esperanto is actually the Euro, not Bitcoin.

It hasn't happened once. Last time it was bouncing between $0.50 and $1.00, briefly crashing to $0.80, then rose past $6, spiked to $30, and came down to $2.50. Anyone who invested 6+ months before the $2.50 bottom still made a ton of money. I don't doubt it will crash. I just can't see it crashing back to $10 with the amount if new money having new interest in it AND the amount of old money having tens of thousands or more sitting in fiat, ready to buy it up as soon as it crashes. Even if it crashes to $10, my savings, and the way I use it, will be unaffected.

When I have to explain it, I don't even mention divisibility, coins, fees, or whatever. I start by explaining it as a shared public ledger that just has numbered accounts not tied to any names, showing a list of all balances for all accounts in existence, and that everyone has a copy of, or direct access to this ledger. That's all a bitcoin is - just an entry in a public ledger. When you send a bitcoin to someone, you just sign off on transferring money from an account you own to some other numbered account, using your secret signature as proof that you want to do it. Since everyone else has a copy of the ledger, they can all verify that you have this money, and haven't spent it. So if you try to spend it twice, they'll see you already spent it before, and if you make up money out of thin air, they'll see that your account didn't have any of that money to begin with. And the whole system is written in open source free code that anyone is free to read through and check to make sure there's no one doing anything scammy. 
Once they get this, and understand why you can't "hack" bitcoin into existence or just make many copies of them (typically first objection of "why should I trust it"), then you can go into benefits and technical details, if they care to know. I don't think most people care about politics, money, or about saving 2% though.

You wouldn't get the private keys if you purchased some bitcoins, except in some very specific circumstances. That said, if you do have a private key you want to import, there is no option for that in Bitcoin-Qt. Your simplest option is to open a wallet on blockchain.info, and use their private key import feature, then once you get the coins in your wallet, send them to your Bitcoin-Qt file. Oh, if you have Android, you can also install a Mycelium bitcoin wallet, and use that, since it has import private keys option too.
Longer answer: there is a tool to import private keys into Bitcoin-Qt, but it's way way way more of a pain in the ass than simply opening a blockchain.info wallet and importing keys that way.

I hope you don't mean that they just change the price that we see, because that would be found instantly. If someone or a bot sees a price of $250, executes a buy, and buys for anything other than $250, the fake price would be discovered instantly. Especially with high frequency trading bots, they would go all haywire.


This has actually happened by accident (software glitch) a few times a long long time ago. It was noticed instantly, and complained about loudly on the forum. The reason being that someone, or a bot, having put up a price at $199, would see the sale happening at $200, and know that their sale was skipped somehow. The glitch had to do with orders not being executed in the correct order. Traders are **VERY** touchy about that. So, again, this will be discovered fast, just as it was over a year ago. (this would apply to them trading to themselves at $3 above price, too)


When I buy from Mt.Gox, I generally buy at below the market rate--it makes sense. There are usually some people willing to sell at a lower rate. My orders don't go through immediately, but there's a "sweet spot" that can usually be hit, resulting in a complete buy at a slightly lower rate.
You are a market maker, selling at a specific price. There are a TON or market takers, including trading bots, who monitor the order books, and buy as a specific price. If the price is fake often enough, again, it will be found out when someone places an instant buy order, and they end up buying at a higher or a lower price.


Agan, you are claiming that you have to accept their rate, while forgetting that you have to actually GET something for their rate. If they say the rate is $203, and I make a buy, I **better** get something for $203. If it's from them, they're just trading like anyone else. If I get something for $202 or $204, I'll know something was wrong instantly.
BTW, the other thing it seems you're forgetting is the whole Supply/Demand thing, which is what actually determines the rate. Even with all of MtGox's possible shenanigans, all they would accomplish is to make a lot of market noise, possibly increasing the buy/sell spread in the process, while the actual price would ignore it and move on it's own long-term. You can't actually raise or lower the overall price without having a lot of money move into or out of the market, since even if you use noise to tick the prices up $1 at a time, that means someone is paying more for it than it's worth, and losing money in the process. Soon as they get out, the price will just come right back down. A good example of this was when MtGox wasn't displaying anything at all due to massive lag during the last few crashes. The spread increased so much that the price was bouncing between $30's and $40's due to everyone trading blind, but the average price still remained somewhat the same.

Without a website, your best option is to either post a bitcoin address somewhere in plaintext, or even better, have people contact you directly to make an order, and you send each customer a different unique address to receive payments to.

Not sure I understand your question, but
The bitcoin address that is stored on Coinbase will be directly linked to your physical identity, yes. Once you get the coins in that address, you can withdraw them to your private address. You can make as many bitcoin addresses as you want, and send the coins between them as often as you want (though you may get charged fees), making it more difficult to trace them back to you. An even better option is what's called a bitcoin tumbler or mixer where a bunch of people deposit coins into the same large pile, and then withdraw their same amount, but from other random people's coins. In the end, although the initial purchace of some amount will be traceable to you, once you mix your coins, the coins you have will have absolutely no link back to you. This mixing option is available for a small fee at blockchain.info, and a few other services, and is planned to be automatically included in a few services and wallets in the near future (near as in maybe a year).

Bitcoin is a commodity, just as all currencies are, with the added benefit of no one trying to keep the price down as more people accept it. It's just that, from a stock comparison, by buying it you're investing in the entire bitcoin economy, instead of just a single company. Want to know if it has the potential to go up, or will come down? Just look at the health and actions of the businesses involved with it.

If you were rational, and knew that bitcoins will go up in value, you wouldn't hold dollars at all. You would buy bitcoin with all the dollars you earn (as I do). Then you would only hoard what you can, and be forced to still sell some to pay for things like food, gas, bills, etc.
The other irrational part comes in where, instead of thinking, "Omg, they are going up, I will hoard them more," we actually think, "Omg, they are going up, I'm rich and can spend more!" This has pretty much been shown to be the case in Bitcoin economy, where people tend to spend more bitcoins when the price is going up, and hold them tight (or even buying more of them) when price is falling.

Back in September, he was upgrading his server, and temporarily moved all files to a different computer that wasn't secured. All those files also included an old wallet file that wasn't encrypted, which happened to have the private keys of the main Bitfloor account. Within a few hours someone found it, stole it, and moved all the money. 25,000BTC total. Since Bitfloor didn't have the money to cover the loss, and from what I understand not enough people were willing to buy it to cover that loss, Bitfloor decided to put a "hold" on stolen bitcoins, continue to operate as usual, and slowly release the "hold" on the stolen coins by replacing them with its own profit. I think Bitfloor only managed to pay back about %3 to %5 of the money.
With the issues at MtGox, Bitfloor's volume has increased tremendously over the last month or two, so they were actually doing well enough to possibly repay that whole lost amount in a year or two, but with this bank closing, just as things were starting to get good, everything came crashing down :(

But, governments won't be able to make any decisions outside of "to mine, or not to mine," since all the other parts of Bitcoin are "locked" into a distributed consensus. So there wouldn't be much to vote on, besides "should government risk going into mining by dumping a ton of money on ASICs." And then, it would still have to compete against much more agile private mining companies that can develop new hardware or change mining methods on a whim, instead of spending weeks going through bureaucratic approval processes for every change under consideration.

Fiat is distributed through banks, so bankers have first dibs on all new currency, and the initial distribution wasn't that different from Bitcoin in regards to how it was concentrated. 
The concentration of wealth in Bitcoin is tighter than in USD, but it should spread out as more people buy in, and more early adopters cash out.
Regardless, the point is no one cares that Sheldon Addleson has $21.8 billion dollars when they are offered USD as salary or in exchange for products and services. And despite there being some political leanings among some of the richest Bitcoin holders, unlike with USD, those holders can't actually influence Bitcoin policy in any way. The algorithm is fixed.

I don't know how coinbase works, but blockchain.info is actually a Java downloadable local wallet with an online blockchain and storage. Essentially, when you go to your blockchain.info wallet, you download your encrypted wallet and wallet software into your browser and decrypt it locally. Whenever you send transactions, it signs all transactions using private keys locally before uploading it to blockchain.info to transmit the transaction. When you log out, it encrypts your wallet locally before uploading the file back to blockchain.info's servers. In that way, blockchain.info never gets a copy of your private key, or even a list of your transactions. All they have are a bunch of encrypted files that they have no access to. So, they can't have insider theft, since insiders don't have access to anything, and they can't have thefts from hacks because thieves won't get anything but a bunch of encrypted files, either. Only way to attack it is with a "man in the middle" attack, where a hacker makes you download malicious code instead of legitimate blockchain.info code when you visit the site, but blockchain helps protect against that with a JavaScript verifying plugin you can install.

* Sure. Bitcoins undermine government's ability to track, seize, and tax bitcoin, and if bitcoins become mainstream, will undermine government's ability to borrow as much as they want, and "print" their debt away. So, since bitcoins make things like money laundering, tax evasion, and circumventing currency controls trivially easy, and since long term it might force governments to be fiscally responsible, there are plenty of reasons for (especially oppressive) governments to make it illegal. Problem is, there are tons of governments in the world, and just because one makes it illegal, doesn't mean others will too, so bitcoin can continue to survive, and ignore the laws.
* Only concern I would have right at this time is whether current increase is a bubble, and if it is, when it will pop and return to a now, lower steady-state (it might reach $300 before returning to $250, or it may be higher or lower. No one knows). Long term? No one really knows.
* If you pay with bitcoins, mix your coins before sending them to gambling sites, and don't use your real name in any way that would associate you with that gambling, you should be fine.
* I hear they have issues staying up when bitcoin fluctuates a lot. My guess is that either they lose more money when bitcoins go up due to fiat being slower to keep up (they sell you coins for $210, but by the time they get your money, coins are worth $230, and they lose $20 in the process), or their trading platform is not able to keep up with trade demand.

You can send bitcoins over SMS. There is software being developed for it right now, which actually works, but is still in alpha stage. It will still rely on a third party to broadcast the transaction, or maybe even store coins, but you'll have your option of whom to rely on, instead of having a monopoly. Besides, internet connected smart phones will be dominant there within the next few years, and with things like Bitcoincard.org, people won't even need phones.


Gavin said tonight that his next big push over the next few months will be multi-signature transactions. Meaning that third party that's storing your coins won't be able to spend them without your second signature. That is unless they just store the coins right on their phone.




Are we still talking about Kenya, or are you talking about Americans and Europeans? Because while the later could care less, the former, when dealing with extortion and bribery, definitely care about who is tracking their money, and how private their transactions are. Kenya has a large black market, too.


With 10%+ fees? Yay.


The article isn't "Kenyans should adopt bitcoin as a transacting intermediary," it's "Kenyans should adopt bitcoin, period." Once local currency exchanges are established, if history is an indication, the fees will be 0.5% to 1%. Still way better than 10%+ And, **like all bitcoin users should**, they only have to keep their money or coins on the thid party services while exchanging. This isn't a problem wit Kenya.

No, no, it's the other way around. The track would be made of steel rails, with gold only acting as insulation around those rails, and the rare earth magnets are only needed on the train cars. Right now, aluminum for insulation is the only viable choice. But, with aluminum, this system can't be scaled down to anything smaller than a 10 ton cargo carrier. With gold, you'd be able to make this work at the scale of a toy model railroad. Except it would be the most expensive model railroad in the world.
The reason Maglev trains aren't being built isn't because of the cost of materials, it's because of the cost of the road/track, including purchasing land. Airplanes trump maglevs, since they just fly over everything. The only viable business case I can come up with for maglevs is when oil becomes so prohibitively expensive, that jets have to revert to slow moving, short distance, electric props, or slower moving, farther distance blimps. Electric powered Maglevs would be the only way to travel quickly at that time.
So, no, I am arguing that gold could be valuable because of a potential use in magnetic levitation technology, where only very little of it is required, but at present, its price is SO much higher than its industrial use price, that we can't even begin to experiment with this technology.
The cable analogy is close, but not quite. You can use copper to make big cables, and teeny tiny cables, and it will still work, but just not as efficiently as gold. With maglev levitation tracks, you simply can not make tiny tracks, because the mechanical physics of the system don't allow it. Kind of like how the Japanese superconducting Maglev system can't go faster than a certain speed (not much faster than it's current limit), because the speed of magnetic currentpermiating aluminum has a certain limit. The Japanese one works by generating that opposing current in aluminum, and repelling from it. If the train goes too fast, it will literally outrun the opposing current it's generating in the track, and fall off of its leading edge.

Not quite. Bitcoin, as a whole, is just a big account ledger, that's just a database of all accounts and how much they all own. Your wallet is just a store of secret signatures for the accounts you own, which are recorded in that big account ledger. When you say you have 50 bitcoin, you are saying that on that big account ledget (called blockchain) there is an account that you own (the account being the bitcoin address) which has a balance of 50 bitcoins in it, and your wallet has the secret signature that can prove that you are indeed the owher of that account, and which allows you to send that money to someone else.

And BTW, if you hate HOA rules, you know how some people and businesses feel having to submit to stupid and ridiculous government regulations, too.
Regarding health insurance, all that someone has to do is shop around and buy whatever health insurance they want, which they could get good reviews for, and can buy or switch from at any time, paying for all of it out of their own pocket. Kinda like car or life insurance. How many of those have you seen deny claims? But that someone can't do that, because they can only buy health insurance provided by their employer, are limited in choices, can only switch to another insurance once a year, and their employer is holding back about $200+ off their every paycheck, so they can't afford to buy the insurance themselves. You know how when you get insurance through your company, you pay $50, while the company pays $200? (Or thereabouts) In reality, that $200 is slated as part of what the company pays per employee, so it's money you earn, not just some gift from the company. And thanks to this setup, you can't afford to pay for your own insurance, AND people don't see just how much health insurance actually costs. If employers stopped providing health insurance, put all that money back into people's paychecks, and people actually saw how ridiculously expensive health insurance truly is, there'd be riots.

Blockchain.info keeps 0 coins in reserve, because they don't store any of your coins, just encrypted backups to which only you have the password. So they have no access to your coins at all, and neither does anyone who might hack them, and thus are a much smaller target than Coinbase. If you have to depend on a URL, a login, and a password for your bitcoins, you are better off with blockchain.info. You can also store a backup in a BIP38 password encrypted paper kept in your wallet, with the private key imported into blockchain.info, and the paper backup being available "just in case."

Unless it changed, from what I understood, 0.8 now has two blockchain database files, one is the full one with all the transactions like you had before, and one is a small one that only has transactions relevant to your wallet. It uses the small one to check and process transactions to/from your addresses, and only loads the smaller one in memory, while still keeping the big one as backup and to check any transactions that may not be in your wallet yet (and to send chunks of the big one to new clients that need to download it). So, you end up with a second database to take up even more space, but the client can run much faster thanks to only needing to work with a smaller database, and new clients can start using bitcoin-qt much faster since they only need to set up the smaller database that's relevant only to their wallet, while the full database file continues to download in the background.
That was the idea, anyway. Not sure if 0.8 implements all that yet. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Yeah, I could see that. To be clear, this came out in both, a class on global economic development, and a class on sourcing (in-/out-/right-/whatever). And the teaching method at this school was all about reading published business research articles from places like Harvard and Yale, as well as guest speakers from various global corps like CSC and such. So it was authority, in a way, but it wasn't just the teacher telling us something and trusting him because he said so.

I don't remember unfunded orders ever actually showing up on the graphs or on the order books. Well, no, not true. They used to, over a year ago, but then people got tired of seeing $1,000,000+ buy and sell walls popping up and distorting the graphs, so that was taken care of quickly.
The only issue that unfunded orders do is make the servers work carder to keep track of them. They don't actually show up anywhere.

Actually, his assessment of the situation and recomendations are spot-on. I don't know exact numbers, but if their SSI will pay them $1,500 a month, their rental properties pay them $3,000 a month, and their condo fee where they live is $800 a month (condo fee they have to pay monthly for ever, not mortgage), then $20k makes very little difference.

No, he did not pay people money to follow his code. On the contrary. He even said he was surprised that they (pool operators) volunteered to lose money by giving up blocks from 0.8 fork to 0.7 fork, for the benefit of Bitcoin's survival. Plus, pools don't use Gavin's code, as the official client sucks for mining with large hash rates. Those pool operators probably had to dig up their own old code to fix the fork.
How is what I said, which was that Gavin was just one of the people discussing things and working together on a solution, not mutually exclusive from bribery? You really ascribe Gavin way more power than he actually has.

I started using bitcoin as my main savings account way back in June of 2011.

The Bitfloor wallet file was and is encrypted. The unencrypted one was a very old backup of a wallet file, which also happened to have a copy of the private key. I guess he didn't use it, didn't know what it had, and forgot about it. Pretty easy mistake, really.
Besides, if he DID steal it, since he was paying back the coins from Bitfloor's profits, the most his nefarious plans would do is allow him to borrow 25,000BTC until he pays it back. Seems like a pretty stupid way to borrow money, considering it puts your business at an enormous risk with no guarantee people would continue to use it after the hack (he got lucky, and people still did)

If they are buying from Asic Miner, then Asic Miner is just taking revenue now instead of later, but will be competing against it's own hardware in the future. Plus people are also buying from BFL and Avalon, and a few other mining companies are getting ready to release ASICs as well. Also, everyone else, including Avalon, are developing new, faster ASICs, too, so... there's really nothing that I see AsicMiner as being competitive with in the long run.
Bitcoin mining is designed so that everyone will keep adding miners, pushing up the difficulty, until costs match revenues from mining. I don't see how AsicMiner can be immune from that.

(stuff like Bitcoin transactions take 10 minutes, when they're instant and just take 10 minutes to clear, Bitcoin is worthless and can't buy anything, when it can buy Dollars/Euros, Bitcoin will  not work because it's deflationary, and no one will want to buy it if it gets too expensive, withour realizing that's a contradictory statement).

Energy storage is the limitation. Always, for everything. We have plenty of ways to make enormous amounts of electrical energy, but no good ways of storing it and not letting it go to waste. Thus crappy power stations, no good electric cars or planes, no phones or laptops that last more than a day or two, no robots walking around, or exoskeletons. Improved energy storage would allow for all these things, including quadcopters that carry heavy packages for more than 3 minutes.

What do unaffected people have to do with 25,000 that was stolen? With the present situation, all the BTC was pulled out (nothing stolen) and all USD is still in linbo, but it's USD, so it can be traced. As for those affected, all those people using Bitfloor who lost coins got a constant reminder that they still have coins on hold, and looked forward to tiny payouts.
TL;DR, I'm not sure how making people who are unaffected forget about the 25,000 theft (many of whom didn't even know about it) would allow him to get away with stealing the 25,000 that people who were affected are keeping tabs on him for.

I'm in the same situation as you, and am glad I was shown that same value (my friends were not, and I'm concerned, as well as a bit miffed at them for being irresponsible). My parents only came to this country in their late 30's, so didn't have a chance to start retiring early. Plus they had to support my brother and myself, so they didn't have any extra cash. Most of the money they were saving up when they did start to save was pumped into properties, which they are using now (the properties are worth a few hundred $k each). Rental income off those properties is enough to live off of comfortably, but just so. $20k put into the properties will at most remodel a bathroom, and won't really increase rent.
Oh, also, my mom got interested in personal finance same time I did, so understands savings and investments fairly well too. She knows bitcoin will fluctuate like crazy, but plans on not selling for at least 5 years, regardless of what happens. If she loses he entire $20k, she said it won't be an issue.

I used to create a backup every two weeks, just as a habit. More recently I switched to Bitcoin Armory (bitcoinarmory.com), which uses a deterministic wallet, and only needed to do a backup once.

At this point, even attempting to mine WITH a fairly intensive and dedicated machine is next to useless. If you are in USA, I'd recomment Coinbase, since they let you do direct ACH transfers. You link your bank account, and deposit into/out of Bitcoin like you would with a PayPal account. There's really nothing simpler than that. You can also check out  under Markets for a list of other exchanges that take other currencies.
For storing the coins in a secure wallet, easiest is blockchain.info. Make sure you use a good password and Google Authenticator, and make sure you back up your wallet.

Since there is no central information point for everyone to monitor, sometimes some nodes don't connect to enough other nodes, and you end up with chunks of interconnected nodes that don't have enough connections to the rest of the network, meaning they are somewhat isolated until they have to download new blocks. Sometimes the nodes between you and the rest of the network just don't trust the transaction for whatever reason, such as it has too little of a fee, it looks spammy, or whatever, so they just ignore it and don't pass it on, until they are forced to include it because it showed up in a block. Sometimes nodes might be confused, thinking they already relayed a transaction, when they haven't. Bitcoin network isn't homogenous, running on dozzens of different wallet and node programs, which try to talk to each other in the same language, but sometimes hickup or stutter.

A. Hold everything in dollars, and pay in dollars. Dollars drop in value 3%. Final profit -3%.
B. Hold partially in dollars and partially in bitcoins. Use dollars for paying, and bitcoins for hoarding. Dollars drop in value 3%, bitcoins rise 10% (just example). Final profit 7%.
C. Hold everything in bitcoins. Pay for everything in bitcoins, and where you can't, sell them for dollars only when you need to. Bitcoins rise 10%. Final profit 10%
Option B is what you propose, while option C is the most rational, assuming you are ok with taking on extra risk. Basically, if you are holding dollars, you are losing on the potential profit from the bitcoins you could have had instead. Option C is what I do, since I have exhausted option B, and have no other way to get more dollars to invest.
To answer your question directly, eventually you shouldn't have any dollars at all. Just bitcoins. At that point, you either have a car (or food, or gas), which you buy with bitcoins, or you don't have a car (or food or gas). Dollars are simply not an option in this case.

The issue is that Bitcoin still fluctuates, and mostly up, so if we just keep saying what we sent in Bitcoins, it'll be hard to keep track of what we have sent before. For instace, some of our first charities have received about $10,000 worth of BTC in today's dollars, but they have all pretty much still received $1,000 at the time. $1,000 is just a simple, easy to recognize number.

Botnets had the same incentive as all other miners: to keep making money. Just because they were doing it illegally doesn't mean they had any less interest in supporting bitcoin and keeping it alive.
Regarding bugs, thanks to the incident that happened in 2010, it's pretty much established that if a serious bug is discovered and someone broke bitcoin, we would just roll back to a block a few hours, or even day(s) back to before the blockchain was broken, and go on from there with a fixed version. The forking incident only reaffirmed that belief. Yes, it would have hurt bitcoin, but it would have also underscored its resilience.
I'm not a security expert. Not by a long shot. I'm not even a software defeloper. I'm a financial analyst. I just read and learned from other bitcoiners on reddit and the forums, and trusted other security experts to keep things safe for me (Thanks Alan of BitcoinArmory!) That said, I did lose a whole 2 btc once a long time ago, when an Android bitcoin wallet bugged out on me, and I couldn't restore my keys due to at-the-time any lack of a key backup system.
In short, I'm not arguing against your claim that a lot of it was luck, as pointing out that a lot of it was just Bitcoin being way more resilient than some people gave it credit for, and me putting way more effort into it than some others have in regards to staying safe (oh yeah, I also didn't invest in any lending schemes :D

I would like to crack down on political corruption as well. I just don't believe that's possible any more. We've gone beyond the point of no return, since it is the lawmakers, the very people who would be passing laws to track down, who are themselves corrupt. They can either vote honorably and crack down on things, at the expense of their own income and tons of negative political adds run against them, or they can keep being corrupt, and have someone stuff their pockets and run propaganda campaigns for them. I just face the fact that the government is already bought and paid for.
As for how regulation can be caried out by an entity that's not a government, Home Owner Association rules and guidelines is a simple example. They are rules agreed on by people living in a community, which are enforced only through civil courts where harm or damage must be shown, as opposed to through laws that can't be challenged. Private insurance has a ton of their own regulations as well, such as your life and health insurance premiums increasing if you smoke or participate in risky activities, your car insurance going up if you have an accident or park in dangerous places, etc. Insurance companies aren't required by law to regulate you from doing stupid things, it just costs you more. Plenty of similar examples abound.

You can't do that with anonymous Bitcoin transactions. So if he wanted to steal the 25,000BTC and run, he could have, and wouldn't even need to run.

In the thefts section, all those thefts simply moved bitcoins from one user to another *except* for the Bitomat.pl Loss. That was a total loss, removing coins from the system completely. So while others shouldn't have an effect on overall price, the Bitomat one should have made it go up.

The way I understand regulation is: Corporation wants to do something, corporation looks for smart people in the regulatory agency that would prevent them from doing something, corporation hires that person by offering higher salary and benefits, the newly hired person writes new regulation laws or procedures on how to avoid regulations, people left at the regulatory agency have no idea what to do or how to regulate the corporation' specific case, and corporation just does what it wanted to do. Wash, rinse, repeat. Plenty of examples of this happening over the last 30 years, which makes regulations do only two things: make things more annoying and costly for large corporations, but otherwise doesn't actually regulate them, AND make it impossible for smaller competitors to enter the market, giving established so-called "regulated" corporations a monopoly on their market.

Instead of extending the decimal point, we would just create a fork that moved the decimal point over. So if you had 0.000123 bitcoins, after the fork you would have 1.23 bitcoins. In the end everyone still has the same value distribution. It would also avoid floating point issues.

Yeah, I've had issues with Coinbase's widget quite often. It asks you to enter a Bitcoin amount, which is 1 by default, then it right away opens the address to send to, asking to send exactly 1BTC, and regardless of what you type into the "how much to send" field," it's always stuck on asking you for 1 btc
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:07:20
They wait for other people to deposit, then break them up into random amounts and send them to random other depositors, so that the coins you withdraw come from someone else instead of you. With this, there's no way to tell where your coins came from. There are a few mixing services out there that charge a fee (Blockchain.info actually has one too), but Instawallet was a free version of doing the same thing, since it pooled all coins together.

This data won't be any more public than the current bitcoin address system. Instead of just knowing that someone somewhere sent X bitcoin to someone else, you will know that someone somewhere sent X bitcoin to someone else to buy Y. You still won't know who, or where on the planet they are.

Good luck. Despite MtGox shutting down trading, you can move your BTC to another exchange in under 60 minutes. If you are a seller, you likely have sold already. You **can't** move your USD to another exchange in under 3 days. Not easily, anyway. So 60%+ of all USD buying power is currently trapped on MtGox, also waiting to buy.

My hypothesis is that in a country where corruption is high, it is easy to bribe politicians to pass regulations that keep competitors out of the market. My evidence for this is all the financial and industry regulations we have in US, Europe, and UK, as well as massive corporate and private business political donations, that makes it impossible for anyone to start any banks or financial services, or manufacturing services, unless they have as much money as already-established businesses. There are also more recent cases of this being pushed on purpose by large corporations, such as Amazon pushing for state sales taxes on online purchases, since Amazon can afford to manage and pay for them, while small shops that may only be selling to small regions or specific states will not.
My second hypothesis is that in countries where corruption is high, and politicians and bureaucrats know they hold power, the incidences of these politicians asking for bribes to get past regulations or to speed things along is prevalent. My supporting evidence is the fact that in places like India, Russia, and Brazil, you can often get your licensing paperwork through the reviewing board many times faster with a bribe than without, and that in many cases there are regulations and licenses required for very plain and innocuous things, which suggests they were only placed there for the purpose of said politicians collecting licensing fees and more bribes.
OK, your turn. Disprove my hypothesis. I would also like to know why you are defending the idea that corruption **does not** increase regulations.

Speculators, and "normal" currency users, already keep this in mind. And there's no way to stop or prevent it.

I would like to crack down on political corruption as well. I just don't believe that's possible any more. We've gone beyond the point of no return, since it is the lawmakers, the very people who would be passing laws to track down, who are themselves corrupt. They can either vote honorably and crack down on things, at the expense of their own income and tons of negative political adds run against them, or they can keep being corrupt, and have someone stuff their pockets and run propaganda campaigns for them. I just face the fact that the government is already bought and paid for.
As for how regulation can be caried out by an entity that's not a government, Home Owner Association rules and guidelines is a simple example. They are rules agreed on by people living in a community, which are enforced only through civil courts where harm or damage must be shown, as opposed to through laws that can't be challenged. Private insurance has a ton of their own regulations as well, such as your life and health insurance premiums increasing if you smoke or participate in risky activities, your car insurance going up if you have an accident or park in dangerous places, etc. Insurance companies aren't required by law to regulate you from doing stupid things, it just costs you more. Plenty of similar examples abound.

Yes, there is. Localbitcoins sellers seem to charge higher than 1% fees (I've seen 3% to 6%). As long as his CoinBase account is tied to the same bank account he deposits cash to, so that he can buy bitcoins as soon as he gets the cash deposited, instead of waiting 2 or 3 days for money transfers, then he can make a few % on every sale. Things to watch out for are counterfeit bills, and bitcoin value going up faster than you can re-buy them. The later is why I stopped selling through localbitcoins - by the time I got my money back into bitcoin, the bitcoin price went up higher than the % I charged to sell.

Technically, giving out your brainwallet or bitcoin wallet password does not actually release any more information. All the information that they would need for investigations is already public in the blockchain. The only thing that giving up your wallet would do is allow them to move your money around and take it from you, which is useless for criminal cases. So, unless there is a court case where the government HAS to take complete ownership of clearly visible money, and be able to take it away from you, in order to prove their case against you, I don't see them needing your brainwallet for any reason.

Since bitcoin is new, and all transaction records have to be kept, we are still trying to figure out how to keep "bad guys" from spamming and flooding the network with useless transactions. Without this limit, someone would be able to send tiny transactions over and over and over, until everyone's hard drives get full, and no one can use any bitcoins. Eventually, as the value of bitcoins goes up, and that 0.0002 is worth something substantial, the fees will go down, and you will be able to spend it again. You can also "sweep" these tiny amounts into a single larger amount (though still paying the same 0.0005 fee). It's a problem that the fix for which is still in development, since Bitcoin is still in beta.

Thanks. It's neat, but not the property required. Mu-metal is ferrous and can guide magnetic flux through it, so if you insulate a steel rod with it, and bring an alternating magnetic field to the rod, the rod will be magnetized to a normal strength, and the mu-metal will just absorb the escaping magnetic flux. If you insulate that rod with gold and bring an alternating magnetic field to it, the gold will generate an opposing magnetic field (eddy currents) at the surface contacting the steel, and not even allow the magnetic flux to escape the steel rod. This will effectively "compress" the entire magnetic flux into the rod, instead of letting it escape, super-magnetizing it and making it almost like a superconductor magnet, but without using liquid nitrogen temperatures. Aluminum works, too, but nowhere near as well.

In short, there needs to be some sort of a publicly viewable database of accounts for you to make sure that the person sending you money actually has money to send. There's no way around this. With dollars and euros, this "publicly" (actually privately) viewable database is on central bank servers, which keeps a list of which private bank has how much, and on private bank servers, which keeps a list of which person has how much. Bitcoin just makes it so everyone can be a central bank and a private bank.
As for anonymity, that's very easy to fix, and plenty of automated serveces are being developed to do it already. Within a year or two you may not even have to worry about it any more.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:25:32


It makes OT generate encrypted signatures that are associated with specific amounts of cash, but which are not linked to any person. So you can send those digital bills to other people over the server, and the server has no idea what is being sent, until someone actually deposits (imports) the cash into their account, and at that point the server still has no wah to tell where or whom that cash came from. So perfect anonymity, though you still have to trust a third party to hold the money backing this digital cash, such as an exchange or wallet service holding the bitcons.
Regarding volatility, OT doesn't actually hold real actual bitcoins. It's a financial system that holds tokens that could represent, and be backed by, a trusted third party. But yes, such a third party can take on the volatility on themselves, and basically offer to convert your BTC tokens into whatever USD value you wish to lock them into.

Anyone trying to pass a counterfeit bitcoin will be instantly found out when someone checks the fake bitcoin's serial number against the global ledger."
If more questions are asked, you can expand with, "creating a valid serial number requires solving an extremely complex mathematical formula that takes a ridiculously expensive amount of computer power, and if you solve it, you'll have a real bitcoin,  not a counterfeit one."  and  "the complex mathematical formula includes a time variable that makes sure that only a specific amount of legitimate bitcoins can be created per a specific period of time."
