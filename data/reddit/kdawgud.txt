You have to use  to get a good estimate based on your zip code and installation direction of the panels.

I just looked up milk. Only inflated 29% since 2000. CPI shows a 52% increase over the same period.  
Looks like poultry was pretty close to the CPI. Beef was much higher, and pork was much lower over the same time period.  CPI being an average seems to check out.
I wouldn't look at luxury shirts and hats.  Too susceptible to marketing strategies. See what a button down shirt at Walmart costs in comparison.  But even that alone isn't a good measure of the average.

This is incorrect.  The CPI (which we use to measure inflation) absolutely [includes that data](
* Food and Beverages (breakfast cereal, milk, coffee, chicken, wine, full service meals, snacks)
* Housing (rent of primary residence, owners' equivalent rent, fuel oil, bedroom furniture)
* Clothes (men's shirts and sweaters, women's dresses, jewelry)
* Transportation (new vehicles, airline fares, gasoline, motor vehicle insurance)
* Medical Care (prescription drugs and medical supplies, physicians' services, eyeglasses and eye care, hospital services)
* Recreation (televisions, toys, pets and pet products, sports equipment, admissions)
* Education and Communication (college tuition, postage, telephone services, computer software and accessories)
* Other Goods and Services (tobacco and smoking products, haircuts and other personal services, funeral expenses)

That's crazy.  It must vary a ton by location. I can have a milk delivered to me via instacart for $2.19/gallon.

I don't see the point of this since this definition of core inflation isn't predominantly used to measure inflation in the USA.  SS benefits use CPI.  I-bond interest rates use CPI.  Inflation calculators use CPI.  What does it matter that this 'core inflation' definition exists but it isn't used to measure inflation in any way that matters?
Where do you see an incorrect version of inflation being used?  We can compare it to CPI and see how it differs.

Are you buying McDonalds at the airport or something?  I can still buy lots of choice for $3/4.  :)
You can't look at a single product over time and use that to measure inflation, because it's subject to all sorts of ups and downs.  That why the CPI is an average taken over many products in many places.  It a certainty that some things will change in price faster or slower than CPI.
Here's a counter-example:  I used to be able to rent a video at blockbuster for $3/night, but now I can rent one at redbox for $1.50/night.  So obviously that one data point is pulling the CPI down.

Where are you buying milk friend?  Mine is always under $2/gal.
