This is an incredibly naive statement on your part. You have some good points, but this statement is one of the reasons why Congress is in such bad shape - because people think government is any type of hand for any group of people. Government was never envisioned to be that, even as George Washington was impressing rural Americans into the Continental Army. US insisted upon limitations on government exist precisely because people mis-interpt government's role as an end all be all *final solution* (and we saw how well that worked for the NSDAP).

You're surely not presuming that the US Government would stop national power generation just to shut down Bitcoin global servers, and the thousands of home process servers, for lack of electricity just to destroy one unsecured investment strategy? (And, I say investment strategy as I agree that the Bank of France is correct to say that Bitcoin is not a currency - Currency is a function of nation-states).

Its bitcoin terminology. Mining bitcoin is more my taste though than just buying it.

I know there is a lot of excited people in here, but you still can't run to the liquor store and buy rum with Bitcoins, you can't transact a car purchase with bitcoins, you can't even buy aspirin for the hangover from the halving party with bitcoins. I am all for clearing out big mega banks from their power and such, but bitcoins seem to be just another fad at the least and a very expensive, energy hungry dalliance of the super geeks with little to no real affects on monetary advantage for the little people. Oh well...

Satoshi Nakamoto one day came out and said that he had "“moved on to other things.” I think that is wise advice, when a man so involved with the creation of a cult-like monetary system one day just disappears.... Quietly he was probably admitting, 'it doesn't work and before anyone turns on me, I'm going to [check out]( '
Its very curious don't you think?- that a man can be so blasé about his baby to the point that he says, "[I just want to be alone](
