Sounds reasonable to me, though I would say sockpuppet-astroturfing is a bit worse. 
Both are bad, but neither is easy to fix, particularly without those with some control necessarily being on your side.  Won't argue against those who wish to try, though.

Yet the community falls for it over and over again.  The people who are at least reasonably intelligent can usually figure it out when presented with information, but they get drowned out by the shills and useful idiots screaming "FUD!"
Then most "normal" people who don't want to spend time investigating it see the pissing contest, shrug, and walk away.  So the average bystander thinks there's an equal debate, no one ever gets punished for their scams (until years later, and only the biggest, most blatant, and poorly executed ones).
It happens over and over again.  You can point to past examples, but the community as a whole never learns from history.  Almost all evidence can be turned away if you deflect hard enough and with enough voices to drown it out.
Gaw, bitfinex, jihan's BU tactics, pirateat40 and the ponzi's of old, countless others.

Edit: wrote a long argument, but it's probably rhetorically pointless so I'll change my argument and keep it simpler.
As stated in the OP, the founder openly and brazenly supported a ponzi scheme.
He's either incredibly dumb or a scammer.  No way to argue that.
If he declared bankruptcy immediately after getting hacked, he'd have a giant target on his head.  He may have also determined there was more value in continuing to run a dishonest exchange, or possibly operate as a fractional reserve, rather than immediately take everything that isn't pinned down.
Another example of bitfinex dishonesty: on the tether site ( they claim 


That appears to be a blatant lie, with no such "professional audits" existing.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

You know shills exist, right?  Doesn't even have to be someone paid by Ver or Jihan, could just be someone short BTC with too much time on their hands.
If you give too much credit to apparent concensus, you'll always be easy to take advantage of.  Dirty tactics work, unfortunately.

There's a good chance you're right, but it's speculation.
If it is true, Amazon could be a little more helpful and informative in their response than "you submitted an invalid gift card," so even then they're on the hook for poor service and communication.

Of course not, I didn't say that you should.  If you can succeed with a civil, straight-forward, fact based discussion, I said you should go for it.  I'd be ecstatic if everyone did that.
Just be aware that you may be at a disadvantage, as your "opponents" - a more efficient way of saying "those who you disagree with" - likely will not share your honorable intentions.
As much as people don't like to admit it, dirty tactics sometimes work.  And people use them.  Deny reality and downvote me as much as you'd apparently like.

Some people can be bought for surprisingly little money.
I don't know about Jihan's history, but it's possibly he was always a "company man" for other interests/investors.
It also sounds like most large businesses in China are entangled with the Communist Party of China/political powers one way or another.

To be fair, they may have never used it - but only because they were waiting for a more profitable opportunity.
It would be pretty obvious to someone if their miners stopped working and potentially reveal the existence of the backdoor.  So they were probably saving it to 51% attack the network if they ever felt the need to.
People have been acting here like Jihan has given up on opposing Segwit/keeping his "asicboost" advantage at all costs just because he's been quiet for a week and BU nodes have been dropping.
We haven't seen the end of the shit he's going to try to pull.  For now he's just staying quiet because nothing has been happening, and the longer nothing happens, the longer he can delay, the more money asicboost makes him.
But when segwit activation starts to near, i'm 99% sure he'll try to pull something.
Edit: We should kill/patch out asicboost functionality, whining miners be damned.  It provides no security benefit and only serves someone who has proven a malicious actor.  We need to put aside vague idealisms that people will never agree on about the nature of bitcoin and what satoshi wanted and act pragmatically.

Yeah, wikipedia is notoriously terrible for having agenda-driven editors/admins with the power to control and revert changes to controversial subjects.  This was true before the current political climate where the division between "left and right" has greatly expanded and everything is viewed under some sort of "us vs them" umbrella.
While we can't truly judge something before it exists, I have my doubts this will be anything other than another politically motivated "journalism/fact-checking" outlet.
There's a lot of controversy around wikipedia, its editing practices, and its use of donated funds for personal benefits, though I'm too lazy to dig it all up (some quick searching will bring up a lot).  I appreciate the service wikipedia offers, but I don't think I'd give them any money.
@_date: 2017-04-29 08:19:02
I think the "compromise fallacy" happens only indirectly.
Entertaining arguments from people who are clearly wrong and supporting a malicious actor makes uninformed parties think that a real "debate" exists, that the answer isn't obvious.
No one wants to read 14 paragraphs from a BU supporter/bitmain defender.  But no one wants to read 20 paragraphs debunking it either.
That's why bitmain's asicboost defense is so long.  Create confusion, lash out at enemies, make it impossible for people to keep a single argument in their head.

Some people are villians.  People need to be held accountable.


If it works, sure, go for it.  But be aware that a bunch of people spamming is also an unfortunately effective strategy, regardless of whether their argument holds up to scrutiny.  That's why obvious scams can still sometimes make a lot of money.
Also, your opponents may not have the high standards of ethical debate that you would like to see.
While you put up your fists for an honorable duel, your opponents may fling mud at your face or shake your hand while their friend hits you from behind.
Edit: How much more info do we need that Jihan and crew are "villains?"  Like I said, this behavior needs to be called out and identified.  The thieves need to be outed to protect the honest:

Did you even read what I wrote, or were you too busy spamming 100 comments per day?
Banking issues are a tiny part of what's wrong with Bitfinex.  In fact, what I wrote specifically AVOIDED the most recent solvency and banking arguments.
Your article, on the other hand, is written by someone named "whalecalls" who starts by whining about "FUD."  Go read the unclescrooge quote at the end of what I wrote again (or for the first time).

For people to stop using bitfinex.
If Bitfinex is insolvent, the damage is already done, even if people try to withdraw now.  But might as well minimize that damage.
If they're solvent but dishonest, well, the faster people get off the exchange the better.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:46:04
I'm not too familiar with omni, but any time you exchange a digital token for USD, the USD itself will have to pass through conventional payment processing methods (banks, paypal, credit cards, etc.)
If bitfinex can't send fiat withdrawals, then most likely tether to usd withdrawals can't be processed either.

You fall for an obvious ponzi scheme (7% weekly interest), you're a moron, it's that simple.

I assume at some point you've seen a "supply and demand" curve - that the price is where the two meet?
It's like that.  If you graph "Bitcoins wanted vs Price " and "Bitcoins offered vs Price" on the same graph, the auction price is where those two lines meet - allowing the maximum number of coins to be exchanged.
Anyone with a purchase price greater than or equal to that price, and anyone with a sale price less than or equal to that price, will exchange at the auction price.
For example, let's say the final price ends up being $1000.  If you said "I want to buy a bitcoin no matter what," and placed an order for 1 bitcoin at $99,999, the final result is you purchasing one bitcoin at the auction price of $1000.  Similarly, someone who offered to sell for $5 would actually sell for $1000.
However, someone who offered to buy for $999 or sell for $1001 would not have their order filled.

From about a week ago?  I think that one was just because Jihan and crew hadn't decided yet if they were more afraid of Litecoin getting to test out Segwit or user-activated soft fork.
So they were keeping the miners to themselves for a while to signal against segwit - even said something about "this is actually good for you because we have lower electricity costs."
They were mining with enough hashrate to block segwit on litecoin, but changed course a couple days later.

Agreed, anyone who wants to read long-winded posts from either side can seek them out.  Those already exist.
We can pretend that people are rationally motivated and will see the light if only we can find the right 500 word argument to convince them, but meanwhile 6 months will pass and Jihan will still be stalling and spouting senseless garbage while nothing changes.
There's a quote, credited to  Mark Twain: "Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference."
Meanwhile, anyone comes to this post looking for context and first they have to sift through random whining before getting real info.

With something as idiotic as paycoin, yeah, it was inevitable.
Unfortunately, there are many scams that go unpunished.
For example, let's say someone runs an altcoin exchange, uses the holdings in their possession to speculate on prices and pumps coins... but what if it works and makes a profit?  They put everyone else's money at risk for their scam, but likely no one would ever be the wiser because it "worked out".
Then of course there are the scams that get caught but some anonymous person just runs away with all the money anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-20 06:01:11
That's just stupid.  If Bitfinex gets shut down, it's because it's insolvent, not because I made a reddit post.  If it's insolvent, the sooner it gets shut down the better - we don't need to build up the bubble bigger and bigger before it pops.
I don't know if you're a shill/spammer or just a normal person with opinions, but there are always fuckers like you who come out of the woodwork to defend these scammers.
Heard of GAW/paycoin?  They just pleaded guilty today.  I was calling them out as well a couple years ago, and I got the same shit from people accusing me of FUD, saying I was just causing people to lose money.
Same shit, different day.  I guess scammers will always roam free since the community is too dumb to defend itself, even when the evidence is obvious.

It skyrocketed before during the ETF buzz, then barely fell during the denial.

Without knowing about the procedure and what usually happens, it's difficult to know if such a review is basically granted automatically when requested or it implies something meaningful.
Considering they forced the petition to go to a decision rather than withdrawing, it's pretty clear (and should have been known to the market) that they planned to do this when the decision came down.

So you come here in the name of promoting healthy communication between those with different opinions.
Then you downvote people who disagree with you.  Cool.
Trust me, I didn't miss the point of this post, and I doubt the poster above you did either.  You cannot "work with" someone whose goals are entirely opposed to your own.
Most here want to better and strengthen the bitcoin ecosystem.  Some of the people on r/btc do as well.  But they're supporting an outright malicious actor who wants to put his and his partners profits above everyone else.
With Asicboost, we basically have the "gun with his fingerprints on it" towards Jihan's malicious behavior, and it explains the motives behind all his actions.  The only thing missing is that no one has technically seen him pull the trigger.  Why do you think the BU nodes have all but disappeared?  The plausible deniability is entirely gone.
To believe Jihan has the Asicboost advantage and has, as he claims to, refrained from using it, is absolutely naive.  Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless.  And we have basically nothing in hand but reasons NOT to trust him.
@_date: 2017-04-26 12:35:55
I'm not encouraging dirty behavior towards goals, and don't believe that I use them myself despite it being arguably rational.
But if we don't at least acknowledge these practices and assume that everyone will come to the table with honest intentions, we will be an easy target to take advantage of.
And yes, that taking the high road will sometimes disadvantage you even if you're aware of it.  But awareness is a start.

There was a time when the price was like a third of a cent.  We're at about 17 doublings later.
One out of 17 doublings isn't necessarily that eventful.  For some, they may have bought a tenth of a bitcoin at $700 and doubled it - nice, but not exactly lifechanging.
For a few, they may have made hundreds of thousands/millions, decide to cash out some and virtually retire and break out the champagne bottles.  They're probably pretty excited.
It all depends.  In the background of all this we still have the cashout problems on what's still one of/the biggest exchange, and who knows what kind of tricks Jihan has left to pull.  Maybe the mythical "$10,000 bitcoin" isn't such a pipe dream, or maybe we'll drop back to $700, no one knows for sure.  Then there's still China problems.
BTC is at an all time high, but there's still a mess behind the scenes - so the question is are we at an all time high despite all these factors, or have they simply not taken complete effect?
