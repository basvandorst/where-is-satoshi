I'm probably alone in this but I really hope bitcoin crashes again. Its like catching measles, everytime you survive a sickness, you will come out of it stronger. It would also scare these get rich quick morons of crypto for good. And it might stabilize the price some more.

As in scaling transaction locking scripts)  by transaction value to reduce fees for small transactions? Or do you mean something else?
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:44:12
Is there a reason for bigger miners with an actual stake in bitcoin (as opposed to temporary mining pools) to not include as many transactions as possible? They loose out on transaction fees and the effort of bundeling transactions seams negliable to hasing quadrillions of headers. Does it have to do with network latency? Thanks for the answer btw

Seams like artificial inflation of fees is gonna get a lot worse as soon as bitcoin rewards decrease. Hope theres gonna be a solution to this
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:39:28
well what do you mean by scaling?
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:31:06
Dont they have to get transactions for the merkel hash
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:03:30
So what exactly do you mean by off-chain? Is there another way to transfer bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:29:46
I get that it is a technical problem, but there must be some solution if bitcoin wants to replace hard currency. If I bought a subway with it I'd spend 20% more.
