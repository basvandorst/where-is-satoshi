Thank you all so so much!! I will be looking into all of this once I have some spare time at work or once I'm home. Will update in case anybody cares that much.

But you're not taxed on it as long as you don't sell I thought...?
Reading by your logic, even if I hold bitcoins, I'm going to be taxed on them?? How does that work exactly???

Welp.... looks like I'll be waiting a while to see my coins back in my wallet, transaction fee is too low to change. Again, thanks to everybody for their input.

I almost don't want to... lol 
Edit: imagine spending 10000 of them for two pizzas!!

Thank you, not sure what Selena is thinking up there then....

Thanks for the info everybody!

That's what I was leaning towards, but didn't want to move anything around if I was on the wrong side. So for instance, I have wallet A with .01 bitcoin and I want to move it to wallet B, I will not be taxed on it?

Thank you! As a semi-newb to the game, I've posted a couple of times with newb questions. Thankfully, all of the answers I got were genuine and true. But a lot of the time I found myself finding extremely old information when browsing the Google machine, even if the info was a few months old, at this day and age, that's old information. So I turned to Reddit, an online, living community of people with relevant information on a particular topic. Why wouldn't one turn to Reddit for learning?? Again, thanks OP!

i'm in your boat as well... almost bought in in 2015 when it was around $260 a coin....still kicking myself in the ass for not going through with it...
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:08
Sound advice, have bought a little around 9200 and then some around 12000, here's to the next $10K!!!
