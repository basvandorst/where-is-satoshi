Do you mind if I look at the transaction ID?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:46:37
Fees too low is likely the reason.
All you can do is wait. 
Or if the amount was enough to sweat over, pay an accelerator to move it along.

Most of these companies are legit actually. The problem is that they can't always guarantee it will work (many factors involved) and because of that they kinda get a bad wrap.
It is indeed possible to accelerate a transaction. These sites are basically miners who will add your transaction to the the next block if you pay them a fee or tip. If you know a miner who is running a full node, you don't need one of those sites. But even he will tell you to keep your fingers crossed. 
Oh yah, if you still need help, I know a guy.

Spelling, grammar, and punctuation are a total train wreck.
Other than that, welcome to BTC

Most likely it will never go through and return to your wallet. This can take anywhere from a week to 6 months or more. Or you can pay an accelerator. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:45:18
I'm guessing it went through since we never heard from him again.

There are accelerator services. Some are free (the first time anyway). Have you tried googling that?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:23:55
You can pay someone to speed it up or wait (at least) 14 days and keep your fingers crossed that it drops from the mem pool and returns to the original wallet from which it came..
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:27:26
There's no telling really. If the fee was too low it will not likely ever confirm. You can wait (at least) 14 days and hopefully it will drop from the mempool and return to your wallet. Or you can pay someone to speed it up.

How exactly did this happen?
How did you lose control of your private key?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:52:02
Can I see the TX ID please?
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:25:04
Did you ever lose service on your phone btw?
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:22:21
This is a real bummer. There may be hope for him I think. Maybe Coinbase will step up and help out.

Rule 
Never leave your funds on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-03-12 14:23:36
BTC will never be popular without a middle man to protect the buyer and/or seller. Refunds are a major part of any business. I would never put my faith in the average joe to make sure my refund comes back. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 14:45:42
Lol. Keep telling yourself that. 
Nobody is asking businesses nicely if they can return stuff. They have a return policy posted that is the same for everyone across the board. 
But what about when I buy a rare item on eBay and the item is not as described?? Currently PayPal grants me a refund no questions asked. Where do I go to get my BTC back? 
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:15:25
Buy a heavy safe and bolt it to your floor. What good is a bank anyway? Are you hoping for interest?

McAffee is an idiot. Nothing he does ever helps BTC. It’s sad he’s always trying to be the authority. People see his dumb face and want nothing to do with any of it.

Anyone who invests in anything knows it’s a gamble. Or at least I hope so. Hence the old saying “never invest more than you’re willing to lose”.

Some would say, that is the beauty of it.

Comparing BTC to anything else is simply futile. The world has never before seen anything like bitcoin. Any investment is a gamble. Nobody can see the future.

Any type of investment is a gamble. We’re all gambling. Stock markets crash just like BTC markets. Nothing in this world has any value. Personally I do both traditional stocks as well as cryptos. IMO, cryptos are waaay more lucrative and fun to trade. I understand my little index fund will bring me 10% a year guaranteed but who cares when I’m seeing 10%+ per day with crypto? This little “crash” is only an opportunity. Old people, set in their ways, are never quick to adopt something new. Better for them to just stay out anyway if they can’t hang. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:26:31
Yep, everything you said is pretty much true. And it’s the same stuff people have been saying since BTC was $1 per coin.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:42:46
So..... hold till I’m dead?
That’s not investing.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:35:42
Everything is speculation. That’s the main thing I’ve learned hodling BTC for years.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:31:37
Remember....NOBODY can predict the future of BTC or anything else for that matter.
The people who said it will go to $1000 are equally as clueless as the people saying it will go to the moon.
