Source? He was 11 years old in 1941. Nazi callaboroator conspiracy stuff comes from people like Alex Jones.

The same people that accuse Soros of being a nazi also accuse him of funding anti fascist anti nazi groups like Antifa.  These accusers are barely self aware.

There is nothing in the bitcoin crypocurrency implementation preventing you from being traceable if you give your tracking information to another entity. Once government or the private individual  disseminates this tracking information its not longer anonymous.

Isn't the point of cryptocurrency to keep things on the books and every thing is tracked in a ledger that is unalterable through crypto ?        From its inception if someone had your wallet address they could track all transactions from that wallet. The only privacy you get is by keeping that address private.  If you post your address here it doesn't go against crypto that you can now be tracked by the average joe.
