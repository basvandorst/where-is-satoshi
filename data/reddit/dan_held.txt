Well said.

That's exactly why its a proper comparison.

The Bitcoin ledger can only be immutable if and only if it is costly to produce.The fact that Proof of Work (PoW) is “costly” is a feature, not a bug. Until very recently, securing something meant building a thick physical wall around whatever is deemed valuable. The new world of cryptocurrency is unintuitive and weird — there are no physical walls to protect our money, no doors to access our vaults. Bitcoin’s public ledger is secured by its collective hashing power: the sum of all energy [expended]( to build the wall. And through its transparent costly design, it would take an equivalent amount of energy to tear it down ([unforgeable costliness](

Concerns over the reduction in block reward vs transactions not compensating miners is overblown. Given Bitcoin's transparent monetary policy, all future worries regarding supply have been factored into the current price.
As evidenced by [linked]( chart, we're seeing total fee revenue slowly trend up in BTC into the coming decades (possibly to \~1% of circulating supply value / year - market will decide).
In economics, the Jevons paradox occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of consumption of that resource rises due to increasing demand. We'll likely see the same paradox occur with lightning/layer 2. 
Regarding on-chain layer 1 fees, most FUDers ignore scaling, and the idea that if Bitcoin became the world reserve currency it becomes the risk-free rate of return. Which means the future "flow" is not just cash flows but all future risk free rate of return (compounded) discounted back to the present.

That's exactly what I did with the "government" estimates.

Nope.

You've missed the point completely.
\- In the first paragraph of the Medium post: "*\*I’d like to caveat that I’m not saying the current implementation of PoW is perfect, nor that it won’t be replaced by a more optimal PoW/PoS"*
\- Everything requires energy (first law of thermodynamics). Claiming that one usage of energy is more or less wasteful than another is completely subjective since all users have paid market rate to utilize that electricity.

Energy and matter are the same thing, e=mc2/thermodynamics
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:59:14
“the electricity consumption per transaction” is not the right KPI for several reasons:
* The energy spent is per block, which can have a varying number of transactions. More transactions does not mean more energy
* The economic density of a Bitcoin transaction is always increasing (Batching, Segwit, Lightning, etc). As bitcoin becomes more of a settlement network, each unit of energy is securing exponentially more and more economic value.
* The average cost per transaction isn’t an adequate metric for measuring the efficiency of Bitcoin’s PoW, it should be defined in terms of the security of an economic history. The energy spend secures the stock of bitcoin, and that that percentage is going down over time as inflation decreases. A Bitcoin “accumulates” the energy associated with all the blocks mined since its creation. [LaurentMT]( a researcher, has found [empirically]( that Bitcoin’s PoW is indeed becoming more efficient over time: increasing cost is counterbalanced by the even greater increasing total value secured by the system.

Great feedback! Thank you :) 
- Agreed the ending wasn't as strong as it could be. I had to be somewhat agnostic (descriptive instead of prescriptive)
