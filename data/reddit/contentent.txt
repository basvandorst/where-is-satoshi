Oh yeah it mentions the drone strikes in the bible

That's what my parents thought Obama was

There's like one degree of separation between my bitcoin and snorting something.
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:06:33
Nope cryptsy has their own debit card. I just can't figure out how to verify my account
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:48:24
Gah, I wish I thought of that one.
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:47:53
Yeah I just figured that out.
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:38:07
Yup. Same problem with mine.
@_date: 2016-01-07 09:24:06
Bitcoin and dogecoin mostly. I know it's my fault too, I just wanted to earn some people who might not have seen it yet.
Edit: earn = warn
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:40:14
Why do you decide to give a bank your money? Or PayPal the number of your debit card?
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:47:31
Didn't know. I just started crypto.
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:46:54
Sure dude. Whatever makes you feel superior.
Edit: also *you're* ftfy
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:00:17
That's kind of a shitty way of trivializing this situation. Equating theft that should not have happened to anyone as a "lesson". Would you say the same thing to someone who gets mugged? "You should be happy you learned not to walk around new york at night for only losing your wallet. For many people it costs them their life. You got a bargain."

Lol it's fine. I wasn't really looking for sympathy. Its just suprising, the amount of negativity there is here lol.
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:46:25
Well I just started crypto. And I guess I just finished too.
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:02:58
Thanks for the idea.
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:47:48
60 bucks. But still =(
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:38:58
No, just autocorrect not knowing what warn is.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:38:32
Love the site dude. Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:46:12
So the most important part you haven't investigated yet?
@_date: 2016-11-18 07:08:01
I lost all my bitcoins and dogecoins to the cryptsy freeze cause I was a noob. **take this advice**
@_date: 2016-02-01 01:36:30
It's funny. The spammer that's spamming me with this prefaces all of his messages with "sorry". Like he knows what he's doing is wrong but has to anyway.

@_date: 2018-02-24 09:06:58
WHAH AM I AGONNA DO???
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:50:19
Remember like 3 years ago when it was only 300?
I hate myself
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:07:10
The Simpson's predicted bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:06:18
To be fair I had a bunch of crypto stored safely away at cryptsy.............
