Physics classes teach you this.  But often they forget to mention that in order for such 'closed-loop' systems to be calculable many variables must be assumed to be 0 or not relevant to the system.  For example, relative velocities and entropy are often considered 0 for easy math, and yet this type of scenario is absolutely non existent in our known universe...  I have postulated to others before that the universe is overall INCREASING in total mass energy, and this accounts for the discrepancies known as dark matter and dark energy.  Time; or more importantly, humans limited perspective of it; is why the discrepancy appears massive on a universal scale but nearly 0 on a local scale.

If you could find 500,000+ Americans willing to work for 1/3 of minimum wage sure you could compete with the Chinese.

Ultimately this will be a win for all coins, and all of the internet as well.  It will legitimize the entire industry surrounding the block chain.   Block chain tech can be a great tool in not just bitcoin, but any transaction... Think about what we can do to elections running on block chain tech!!!
