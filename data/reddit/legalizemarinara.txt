I consider myself a libertarian, so I should be part of the target audience for Bitcoin. And indeed I've been a long term hodler. I love the technology.
However, even I get frustrated by the poorly informed and generally insufferable libertarians I so often see posting on here.
Allah only knows how it looks to the rest of the world.

As a citizen of one of these countries, I can say that it has definitely caused a problem on occasion even in face-to-face trade. It's likely to be a bigger problem for online trade.

I'm inclined to agree with you that deflation is problematic. I previously was more on the fence about this, but 
made some interesting - and imo quite convincing - arguments against me [in this thread]( 
However, I think that our currency supply policy has to be sacrosanct. We can't just change the rules mid-game without expecting some massive blowback.
Upvote for raising an interesting topic, even though I can't agree with your suggestion about how to proceed.
@_date: 2014-11-15 07:34:40
I basically agree, but I think it's a much bigger problem on large subs than small subs.
If it's a small sub on some topic the mods are passionate about things can be cool.

It seems to me from reading this that Yishan is extremely pro-Bitcoin, and extremely anti the greedy neckbeard conspiratards one often finds on here.
Sounds eminently reasonable to me. =/= bitcoin.

I realise you're just copying the article title...but seriously, **glamorous**? 
@_date: 2014-11-02 05:52:14
+1 for Dogecoin being high-class subtle satire of Bitcoin, and generally a positive thing, even if they've somewhat turned into the thing they were satirizing. 
By contrast Buttcoin's satire is hopelessly blunt-edged, and a lot of the posts there just scream "Antisocial Personality Disorder".

This is pretty standard. Our Foundation has been a lead weight for a long while now.

I know "why can't we all just get along" is cliched but sometimes it applies 100%. I sat on a doge tip on my old account until it got returned to sender, but I'm gonna take this one now. :) Cheers, @_date: 2014-11-10 14:13:38
Not everyone here thinks a deflationary currency is a good idea...but given that versus what's currently happening to the US dollar I'll take the former.

Hmmm, I just worked it out and srsly the answer is "bout tree fiddy" (%).

It's a nice perspective, though the Bitcoin brand still makes for good conversation fodder in some countries. I had no trouble chatting about it in Germany, for example.

Without commenting on the museum itself, as I haven't been there, I think this is a really neat idea. Props to you for coming up with it, and I'll certainly drop by next time in in Orlando.

Somewhat off topic, but are there really two separate users called - respectively - BigMoneyGuy and RichBitcoiner, both hating on changetip in this thread?
I took a bit of a break from reddit and and pretty much missed the Bitcoin boom and bust...are usernames like that normal on now?
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:40:31
I always assumed it was because people factored in the probability that the exchange would simply run off with the Bitcoins one day. That could happen with any exchange, but for various reasons it's judged to be more likely at BTC-E than other exchanges.
Is there another reason as well?
@_date: 2014-10-31 23:47:21
Almost all the early Bitcoin companies will fail, just as almost all early internet companies failed. I agree that the Coinbase AMA didn't really provide any reason to think that they would be an exception to the general rule.
@_date: 2014-10-31 23:56:28


Think of centralization as a continuum and not a binary thing. Bitcoin is decently decentralized at present but it's not clear it will always be so.
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:51:44
You know that Reddit's CEO said 
"Without being too inflammatory, the userbase for bitcoin is basically crazy libertarians who are increasingly poorly-informed about currency systems and macroeconomics.  I say 'increasingly' because at one time it was fairly well-informed libertarians but as the currency has become mainstream, it’s attracted more poorly-informed individuals and the conversation have become more polarized and less knowledge-based, driving the well-informed and balanced people away, or at least prompting them to recede into the background."
I think things will change for the better, though. We're just going through an idiotic adolescence.

You're right that it does strengthen the market, and some coins - especially Doge - act as 'gateway cryptos' for Bitcoin.
The whole notion of competition between us and alts is ridiculous. We're not even serving the same niches.
@_date: 2014-11-01 04:07:43
Yeah, I totally agree with that. We need to see sidechains as a way to help decentralize/improve Bitcoin further, and not as some kind of way to attack existing altcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-29 04:01:45
$1 million turnover isn't that impressive, but I agree that the growth prospects are strong. Singapore's attitude to Bitcoin has been very positive.
@_date: 2014-10-24 07:31:53
Linking to idiocy of this sort is very counterproductive for Bitcoin. We have to face so many people in the general public spreading falsehoods about our coin, so why inflict it on others?
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:34:39
This is certainly a major reason. Another way of looking at it is that - even if they don't have any strong hope to get rich quick themselves - people don't want to pay a big premium to early adopters, merely in order to be able to use a digital currency.
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:34:18
That's true, but the true problem isn't the fact that people make dickish comments here, but rather that those comments get substantially upvoted. It turns people off Bitcoin, and not just people who have actually been stolen from.
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:43:47
Yes please
@_date: 2014-11-02 05:59:38
Seems like pretty good timing to me. I feel like anything in the 250-350 range is a decent buy-in point.

It's telling that the number of transactions has managed to rise beyond that of Dec 2013, despite a rather poor price trajectory. It's a very good sign.
If the price trajectory happens to change, the number of transactions would take off.

There's at least one altcoin that is successful without any technical innovations at all. Reflect on that and you'll see why sidechains aren't going to kill altcoins. Part of the reason altcoins are popular is precisely because they are at arm's length from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:25:40
One problem is that altcoin somehow became acceptable as a term of abuse among ignorant highlanders, as though the existence of these coins wasn't beneficial to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-28 02:56:14
This relationship raises lots of conflict of interest problems. They've certainly made a lot of money out of the exchange and out of Litecoin, and Litecoin is basically Charlie's fiefdom.
It's one reason I've never really bothered to collect many Litecoins. Well, aside from the fact that it seems a bit pointless. Though I guess it's the heir apparent if Bitcoin were to fuck itself completely.
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:25:11
Google coinjar bitcoinica before using that service. One of the founders was involved in a scam and the victims are still - and will remain - out of pocket.
I've used LocalBitcoins without any problems.

I think it got deleted and then restored, though.

The "about Bitcoin" is redundant in that sentence.

It's different because Zhou was already a scammer prior to creating the site. Mark Marie Robert Karpelès only became a criminal after acquiring mtgox.
We're beyond fucked if we let scammers get a 'fresh start' in this way.
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:00:22
This is a very good question and doesn't deserve to be buried.
It sounds like your mom wants Bitcoin as a speculative investment rather than to spend it. Given that's the case, how about just you arrange everything and then she stores a paper wallet?

Contrary some comments in this thread, Varoufakis is on record as saying [Bitcoin is flawed due to its lack of inflation]( There's no way Bitcoin will be part of any plans he's involved with.

One day Krugman will pull the mask off and reveal that he's been conducting a 50-year experiment in whether economists will follow a guru who spouts total gibberish. It's like the Sokal experiment on a grand scale.

So he's not a bomb-clutching anarchist? So what?

This is only a problem if you assume that there needs to be one coin to rule them all. There are already altcoins that handle microtransactions better than Bitcoin. I seem to recall that one of Andreas's talks discusses this in more detail - perhaps the Canadian Senate testimony.

This is hands down the highest quality trolling I have ever seen on reddit.

The elements that given cryptocurrency most utility, e.g. ability to cheaply/quickly/pseudonymously make international transactions, are generally not so applicable to the average person in their 50s or 60s. 
But it's not unreasonable for your mom to bet on there being a lot of other people out there who will find it practically useful, even if she personally does not.
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:57:58
Google Coinjar Bitcoinica, and never use them again.

Bitcoin is robust if you can assume that people will only attack it if it's in their financial self-interest to do so.

Ty Vlad, but I can use Bitcoins for all operations, since I don't live in a backwards oligarchy.

I won't use Coinjar for the same reason.

It's a great shame Bitcoin wasn't spread more widely in those days when anyone could mine, but we did the best we could.
I imagine any new "mined by the masses" coin would probably be insta 50% attacked, so Bitcoin will have few rivals in terms of the initial distribution of coins. Unless Doge or Lite did better, but if so they probably didn't do much better.
