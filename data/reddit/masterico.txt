Wow! The great future comes! In my opinion, investment in good projects related to crypto is really progressive  way to make money.  From what I've seen in several forums it seems that Socratus is a reliable company. It's  a platform for insurance companies that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple. It helps to get read of annoying personal meetings and paper work. I think that Socratus really deserves to be invested in.
