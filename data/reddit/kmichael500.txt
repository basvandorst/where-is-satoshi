Not perhaps, it **needs** to be free for customers.  Most customers won't pay for an app just to spend money at restaurants/bars/wherever.

I'm 16, and I lost .6 BTC.  I tried to withdraw the Bitcoins a few days ago when I found out about Gox's issues...and all the sudden they "required" verification. (I withdrew some a few months ago and did not need any verification...) So I wasn't able to withdraw in time :/

Thanks! Just downloaded the Quark wallet.  You are the first person to ever tip me :)

This ^ is why I like using QR codes.

Luckily, I still have Blockchain's wallet app, but I didn't download the Coinbase app :/

YES! I used to live in Los Angeles, and I would have used bitcoins. When I go back, I will definitely go to Subway more if they accept bitcoins.

I was thinking of buying some at $100, but I couldn't, then the next day when it went to $225 I was going to buy some. But since it was fluctuating and not really going up, I decided not to buy any...
Today its at $225!!! WTF! I wish I bought some now. And probably will wish I bought some today when it goes to $300 tomorrow...
Does anyone else think they will go up from the price they are at currently?

I was too going to buy them when they were that low. Even when they were at $30 I was considering buying about 100 BTC...WHY!! I would have made $7,200!
Anyways, I bought 0.65253973 BTC for $150 today. I'm too scared they'll go down or I would have bought more...

I bought some Litecoins with btc-e.  I already had some Bitcoins so I used btc-e because it seemed to be the easiest way. After I saw this post though, I am transferring the litecoins out.

Oops, meant to say $225...
