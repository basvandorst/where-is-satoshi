They're selling BTC miners that at this point, don't produce any goddamn bitcoin. 
But HashPoints and unicorn farts, yeah they produce that all the-live-long-day.
Yeah, I object to that "way of doing business".

They're out downvoting everyone, but really they can only mitigate people figuring this out, not stop it completely. 
It'll be really interesting to see the post mortem on this six months down the line.

And yet the Hashtalkers (should it be Staketalk now?) keep saying that Josh always comes through for his customers.
From what I'm seeing, Josh's promises outweigh his deliveries by a large margin. And as we see the end of Hashlets, a bunch of his promises about Primes and Zens are now dead and gone, never to have been realized.

Finally more people speaking up. Thank you.

Don't listen to him. He's just a sycophant because he's made money on the affiliate program, selling baubles to other unsuspecting people.
You can't make bitcoin with hashlets right now. Current ROI even on Zen hashlets is something like &gt;10 years at current pool rates.
Everyone cheerleading GAW right now thinks that they're going to get 500% return on their "hashpoints", or is making money via the affiliate program.
He'll slink back off into his cave as soon as the GAW house of cards falls down, to look for the next Ponzi scheme he can get in "on the top of".  Trust me, he's making his "coin" by selling hashlets, be it through the market or through affiliate links, not through mining.
People who champion this shit are perpetrators too, just secondary ones.
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:29:28
No evidence? Look around. You buy 1MH of scrypt mining at twice market price, and they take 90% of your "miner's" output in fees.  
The solution? Mine HashPoints, which are essentially completely unusable IOUs that GAW says will be worth somewhere between 1 and 5 cents someday. 
"We promise. Really. Totally. You can trust us. After all, we gave you a free Hashlet Solo that now produces 1 satoshi a day. Pinkie swear."
Yeah. That's legit.

In the future we'll be wondering why we aren't paying some company $10 per coin per 3-months for the privilege of PoS capability?
So now we're not only centralizing crypto, we're centralizing the wallets and stake? 
How many hashpoints are you getting for these posts?
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:47:26
At current rates, a $7 Hashlet Solo would take 191256 years to ROI.
Always Profitable.

More like a challenge to see if they are. KC6TTR may be putting this in front of the FCC as a bluff or a hunch. But the result of it will be some form of equipment, power, or emissions audit. 
End result, we find out if they are actually mining in there.
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:45:04
That's how Josh rolls. A big part of the army is Josh himself. It's very strange. Most of the short posts on Hashtalk that contain marketing speak, like "One word - INNOVATIVE!" and "This innovation is amazing!" are probably Garza himself.
He's definitely building a reality. Probably most of the angry screaming messages I've gotten here have been directly from Josh. I should feel honored.
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:52:39
Looks like the hashtalkers and GAW devotees are already filling it with the usual highschool-grade crap that they use to beat down anyone who disagrees with them on any forum.
I don't understand how GAW doesn't realize they're not helping themselves by building an army of assholes to defend their practices. These responders don't help GAW, they only hurt them. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:40:32
Yes and yes. I bought in loyally after having hardware miners from them, and began when hashlets were released.  I've made about 20% ROI to date, because I thought the "you're supposed to trade and sell the miners themselves" route of making ROI was specious at best.  
The only possible way to have ROI'd at this point is to have hit it big by being lucky (note, lucky, not smart) by buying a lot of primes at $16 and then selling them at $50.  Some people have been able to do this, and of course, they applaud themselves for being geniuses, when in reality, hindsight is 20/20 of course, and when the $16 hashlets came out, nobody knew what was about to unfold. 
I bought some Primes at various prices - and Zens at various prices - but the mixture was not a winning powerball, hence my result of about 20% ROI, which I believe is actually more typical of GAW customers than the people on Reddit and Bitcointalk praising themselves for predictive skill and ferreting out Josh's between-the-lines hints.
I will never make ROI, my investment in GAW has served one purpose, and that is to enrich Josh Garza - nothing else. 
So, people say, well, Bad investment, suck it up.  No.  GAW actively mislead. GAW continually said, and says, that Primes would be worth more than $50. Now Primes are effectively being abandoned and you're left to gamble with a new decision: HashStaker Primes.  Zens, "the world's most profitable pool" - Not so much. Returning to its "former glory" at "twice or even more than it was".  Never happened, never will happen - it's now the end of the line for Zens.  Can I count more? SHA-256 for Primes, vanished into thin air. (Probably because it would have been too profitable.)  
One can say that a bad choice was made if the choices didn't involve a shell game and consistent fake-outs from the CEO.  
Others will talk it up to "skill" on timing the market. There is no such thing. It is luck, and some people, indeed, got lucky. Good for them, but it's the exception, not the rule.
So my main beef with GAW is their misleading practices and constant fall-through on promises and direction shifts.  One jackpot going off in a casino doesn't prove that you'll win, and it certainly doesn't speak to the remainder of the gamblers' "skill".  What's worse, is when many people didn't even know they were entering a casino to begin with.
Hashlets were advertised as bitcoin miners. Now, Hashlet is dead, long live PayCoin and the HashStaker (well -- 3 to 6 months live the HashStaker) and if you bought in for Bitcoin, you better about-face and double down for PayCoin or you'll be left with 1 satoshi per day. (Always profitable!)
My second problem is absolutely the people not just blindly following Josh, but defending him and absolutely committing to him in a way that probably hasn't been seen since L. Ron Hubbard or Jim Jones. It's absolutely uncanny and spooky. 
Right now these people are all rallying over something that *simply does not exist* yet.  There are NO Paycoins. There is NOTHING but a repurposed loyalty point function and a bunch of handwaving. Hell, even HashStakers right now cannot do a single freaking thing. But people are paying $10 and $18 for those promises, too. 
Yes. People are trying to figure out how to give the next hundred, thousand, or ten thousand dollars to Josh based on nothing but vague and constantly rearranging utterances, of what is to come. 
Over a number in the upper right corner of a website which currently, at this time, is **absolutely nothing but a score**. 
If you want to transform thousands of dollars of your fiat into a **score** (hashpoints) -- that you can currently do nothing with but look at -- be my guest. 
But it's not even a house of cards at this point. It's a conceptual description of a house of cards.
GAW people can call me a troll all they want. Whether I'm here or not, Garza has to start delivering more than promises promises and only promises *very damn soon*, or the result will be such that I will not even have to type a single word to be vindicated on my warning.
If GAW wants to shut the naysayers up, all they have to do is show us. And if they are honest people, that will not be difficult at all to do.
But to date, it is nothing but promises. Promises are something - see my list above - that Josh Garza tends to break.

Right, but ham radio is a licensed FCC service and CB is not. Also, the bitcoin miners are neither licensed nor registered (FCC Part 15).
When it comes to an unlicensed RF device versus a licensed one, the licensed one has the right of way. 
So yes I'm not doubting what you're saying - but what I'm adding is, in the case of ham radio, the person interfering with it has to stop, because they're emitting unlicensed transmissions which are interfering with the licensed service.
Same would happen if your microwave was interfering with the phone company's cellular tower (licensed and registered) -- you'd have to remedy it, not them.
So if GAW is interfering with hams, they have to fix it, and here comes the fun part: they have to detail it in a letter to the FCC,  which is publically accessible and a matter of public record, what actions they took to fix it.
It's basically forcing GAWs hand on some degree of transparency. "Dear FCC, We don't have any miners" or "Dear FCC, here's what we did to fix our miners - (power and emission calculations follow)" And everyone gets to see it.
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:39:50
Always "just around the corner."  Even though there isn't actually any mining going on, they've been trying oh so hard to get that SHA-256 feature into Primes, which has been "in testing" for all of October.
Bullshit that - they're waiting for SHA-256 rates/difficulty to fall to the point where it'll be as unprofitable to "miners" as all of their other options. Soon as 40MH/s per Prime produces like 8 satoshi with a 7 satoshi fee, testing will be complete!!! Praise GAW!
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:29:13
Actually, it's the operator's job. If you're operating non-compliant hardware, you have to stop operating it.  Power companies have had to tear out entire substations because of incidental radiators. 
If this actually is true, and not just supposed, GAW will either have to stop "transmitting" or bring the devices into compliance.
That said, if they aren't FCC registered and still aren't transmitting spurious emissions, then GAW is probably in the clear.
If they actually are though, yes, it's on them.
But as the poster below says, this will at least have the FCC come take a peek around.  And in that action, the public will find out what they're operating in there.  Whether they're incidental radiators or not, is probably beside the point.
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:25:51
Amps. Yeah. Making your $21-for-1MH/Scrypt into 1.10MH/Scrypt for a little while. For a cost. Generous, GAW is.
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:42:17
You're making "coin" now with payouts equaling maintenance fees? How much did you get buttered up by Josh before he slipped it in? Somehow you're still "making coin", even though the math is what it is - maintenance fees at 80% or more of payouts. "ZenPool" is usually one of the middling or lower pools.
Oh right. I'm sure you're not actually making BTC through *mining* , but through selling Hashlets, being an affiliate, and referrals. So basically you are part of GAW.
Hashlets are worthless.  Show some math instead of testosterone. As far as actual *bitcoin* goes, GAW isn't paying out *shit* right now.
And don't talk to me about "HashPoints". You do realize that "HashPoints" are currently worth nothing but promises of blue sky, right?
Hashcoin doesn't exist right now.
Have fun mining imaginary promise coins. Why a bunch of you guys are so obsessed with this man and this company, who's taking money from people and delivering nothing but promises that never materialize, is honestly fucking fascinating.
Throw someone a free Hashlet Solo which produces 1 satoshi per 1Mh/day and you have a dedicatee for life now, I guess.  
... Or maybe you're talking about all the money you made on referrals and the affiliate program, peddling this bullshit to everyone else.
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:10:39
This stuff gets cultier and cultier.
Oh, BTW, as of today, GAW is leaving Bitcoin miners to wither on the vine.  Convert to a PayCoin staking wallet, (Remember, PayCoin STILL does not exist) or be happy with your 1 satoshi a day from now on.
Another change in direction, another move towards mining IOU-points for non existent coins.
And yet they still love the guy. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:32:27
In the court of public opinion, it's not "innocent until proven guilty". It's "show me."
If someone actually wants to **mine bitcoin** , can you actually in good conscience suggest GAW over the many other companies out there with lower prices per MH and half the fees?
Or are you just going to regurgitate "the ZenPool payout reduction is only temporary" and "HashPoints/HashCoin will go to the moooon" GAW talking points?
Yeah. ZenPool will go back to 0.0006 BTC-per-day-per-MH.  Sure. Any day now. Because "contract negotiations".
If you bought Hashlets to mine Bitcoin, you are, in fact, irrefutably, via mathematics -- shit out of luck.
@_date: 2014-11-04 09:57:50

@_date: 2014-11-28 20:40:05
The problem is, you're not fighting a company, you're fighting an almost religious movement.  
Josh has gotten a groundswell of followers, based on promises, and promises of *a piece of blue sky* (there's a reason why I use that term) that's approaching a model similar to Scientology.
It's amazing how cheap loyalty is. A free Solo, an upvote for 1/4 of a PayCoin here or there. and you have a sychophant for life. Anyone who questions the promises and hope, is of course, a "troll" - I'm sure after I post this, my inbox will fill up full of threats and invectives as usual. *Just a note to Josh and friends, I do not read them. I click on the envelope to clear what's new, and that's that.*
GAW's latest offering, HashStaker, is basically you, the customer -- paying for the ability to lock up your PayCoins.  Paying for PoS.  Strangest thing I've ever seen.  Yet everyone's eating it up. Again. Making projections on ROI based on dictated values of PayCoin, which **does not exist yet**.  
Even after GAW pulls back the curtain and turns the lights out, which will eventually happen, Reddit and Bitcointalk will likely still be riddled with defenders of Josh, simply because of people Seeking Alpha. It's an interesting phenomenon to watch, but not a very fun one to be part of.
You tell a GAW sychophant that *spending money for the privilege of being able to multiply an altcoin which does not exist yet* is an unwise idea, and they'll just blast imaginary numbers back at you. ROI based on PayCoin being $20 or more in 6 months.  And then they'll call you a troll. And threaten you. 
For what? The feeling of being part of a "movement". 
Sorry. That's hope and dreams, people. And nothing but.
But apparently, if I say that there's no guarantee that PayCoin will even be worth $20 in 6 months, when right now, it absolutely does not even exist -- that's "trolling".
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:38:00
You got it. Except that right now, HashPoints **can't even be used as store credit**.  You can't even buy more Blue Sky Mining Company Hashlets for them anymore.
But, Hashcoin, yeah -- that's gonna take off.  What the crypto scene needs right now is another altcoin. Like a hole in the head.
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:14:51
ugh. I mentioned this a while back in Gaw's subreddit. I got promptly banned for "slander".
Right now - GAW is basically having people buy "Bitcoin cloud mining", that cost 90% of mined output in fees if you actually mine Bitcoin.
These fees are waived if you mine "Hashpoints", which are GAW's blue-sky promises and IOUs which are currently not useable or transferrable for ANYTHING.
And yes, the dissent-culling methods on Hashtalk are nothing but genius. Money if you agree, debit and banning if you don't.  The result is: only sycophants post; everyone else is banned or stays in read-only mode.
Note to OP: ZenPool, the "World's Highest Paying Pool" now is one of the lower paying pools. The CEO explains it as "contract negotiation" and pretty much everyone there believes it's "temporary."  20 satoshi says it's anything but, and it's just the first sign of the house of cards starting to come down.
I do believe HashCoin will be released, and I do believe there'll be a few buyers at $20, but not as many sellers that bought in at $4 and $10.  The price will rapidly sink and in a few days time after the "ICO", the emperor will be feeling a draft.
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:43:59
So, Amazon and Target won't accept BTC, but they will accept HashCoin, because of Josh's smooth dance moves and excellent hair.
Josh also says GAW has acquired "several multipools, and a publication" in the last month. Yet nobody has any clue what those are. 
Yes, HashFan. Most corporate legal departments exist for the SOLE PURPOSE of disclaiming liability.  So when you write to them and ask "Are you affiliated with this dude named Josh?" - they will tell you UNEQUIVOCALLY, NO.  
Go ahead and try it yourself. GAW can work out a deal with Target and Amazon, but can't get SHA-256 working on Primes?
Yeah okay. That happened.
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:49:58
So do you actually believe that the reason ZenPool doesn't pay **DOUBLE** what every other pool pays, like it used to, is really because Josh is in "contract negotiations", not because they've had a falloff of new customers due to the fact that their pricing and fees are twice what competitors offer?
ZenPool paid what it did due to growth and increasing hashlet purchases. Now that this has slowed, ZenPool is - surprise - one of the lower paying pools.
Using new customers signups to pay extant customers is not "profit sharing", it is, in fact, a Ponzi scheme. Look it up in your Funk and Wagnalls.
Of course it isn't "documented", no such stratagems are "documented" before they're found out and everyone loses.
Seriously dude, where are you getting your piss and vinegar? Because it's NOT from MINING at GAW.  Unless 1 satoshi per day really does excite you.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:11:53
You'll be able to mine HashCoin with interocitors, dilithium crystals, and flux capacitors.
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:31:20
No staking yet, since not a single PayCoin exists yet.
Right now, they're non-mining non-coins from an IOU "pool".
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:23:16
Yeah pretty much this. It's not exactly that people like to get scammed, but that they like the idea of "hope", and the idea that the lottery ticket they just bought COULD be the winning one.
Some have just put in a lot of money and have to stand behind their decision. And, yes, even though I got banned for trying to ring the alarm bells about GAW, I'm probably going to be one of the first people that the fanboys scream at when this all comes crashing down; "Why didn't you do MORE??!"
Screw it. I'm tired of the black eyes Crypto is getting thanks to the likes of Gox and Moolah, but horse/water/drink and two to tango, etc.. they can keep mining their Hope and Dream points that they can someday-we-promise exchange for Hope and Dream coins.
Disclosure - I have like $500 tied up in GAW Hashlets, bought when I thought they were just plain 'ol 1MH of scrypt mining. (Boy was I wrong.) Maybe now I can finally sell some of them off to some True Believers who think that Josh Garza actually gives a damn about them.
@_date: 2014-11-04 09:31:58
The problem is that a lot of these "investors" are just BTC miners who had the scheme switched out from under them. 
And GAW is still advertising Hashlet as a bog standard Bitcoin miner, when it is in fact anything but.
So people who bought in, in good faith, got subject to a shell game without even seeing it coming, and every day new people get pulled in as well.
Think about it - you buy a $15/Mh bitcoin miner that looks great in the glossies and on the super-slick webpage from a company that used to sell ASICs. You sign in, everything looks on the up and up, until a day or two later you realize that the "miner" is paying out effectively nothing.
"Oh, but we have an answer for that!" says GAW, and points you to the HashCoin whitepaper and the scores of cheerleaders on hashtalk.
Since you've already spent your money, you don't want to just roll over and play dead, so next thing you know you're on the Hope and Dreams train with Hashcoin.
Honestly, I don't blame 'em.  People got suckered. And it was gradual. Now their only hope for not getting fleeced is to squeeze a few drops from this Hashcoin fiasco.
Really, most of the people who have been taken for a ride here were just everyday miners buying things that were masquerading rather well as legitimate cloud mining shares.  "Until they weren't."
@_date: 2014-11-04 09:37:26
Yeah. I agree, but it may not be as kool-aid as it looks. Unfortunately that's just how you have to speak on hashtalk. 
For example, a skeptic who has reservations - Actual feelings, what they'd like to say:
"Hmm, I don't like this Hashcoin thing - I hope it lets me at least break even :| So how do we go about using our HashPoints when the ICO happens? :| I want to see if I can at least convert to over 1 satoshi per day... fingers crossed..." 
Must say in Hashtalk-language:
"WOOHOO! I can't WAIT to see how HashPoints are converted to HashCoins! SO EXCITED!!! Josh has NEVER LET US DOWN! HASHCOIN TO THE MOON BABY!!! WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THE WORLD! GAWSOME!!!!"
... it's just that saying anything differently will get you downvoted and autobanned there. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:55:17
I've never given gold before. I just gave gold for this. Thank you, thank you, thank you for speaking up like this. I tried in and on hashtalk.org, but got silenced, as is GAW's way.
You just saved people a lot of financial heartache.
@_date: 2014-11-04 10:10:23
All I have to say is, from personal experience there - if you bought what were purported to be bitcoin cloud mining shares, and suddenly everything started going bizzaro-land, you'd be wishing and hoping to get out too.
I've pretty much kissed my $500 in purchases over there goodbye, as one day BTC payouts just became non-existent. 
Many GAW customers know what's up, they just have to phrase it in such a way that they won't get their account dinged or banned over on HashTalk. 
I'm glad others are beginning to warn about them outside of HashTalk - the echo-chamber reinforcement system over there is other-worldly. Any post made has to be translated into propaganda - it only takes 10 downvotes (or is it five?) to get the banhammer and a healthy deduction from your mining account. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:25:49
If GAW is operating incidental radiators, they're operating incidental radiators. Garza doesn't get an exemption for his hair or the fact that he has a Tesla on pre-order. I suppose Josh should be determined to be above the law because he's just a really super cool guy? 
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:17:21
your "$16 hashlets becoming $50" was simply you being thrown a treat.
Promises were made for Primes, people bought in at $50 with promises that they'd be "worth many times more than that", and now it's the end of the road for Primes.  
- Sha-256 was promised and never happened.  
- "Amps" were promised and never happened. 
- Multiple algos were promised and never happened. 
- The "Return of ZenPool at twice or more what it was" was promised and never happened. 
- "Continually Reducing maintenance fees" never happened. (They were never reduced even once.)
Yet people still spout out this crap about how "Josh always comes through".  How? Because he threw some free Solos, which now produce 1 satoshi per day, last summer?  Because he spawned a speculative price bubble to $50 on Primes which still don't do jack?
Now, you have the option on Friday and Friday only, to """upgrade""" your Primes to stakers which will pay out PayCoin (which still doesn't exist) twice a year.  
You can do that, or you can leave it as a Prime Hashlet, which, let's not kid ourselves -- will never get another damn feature ever again, and will end up paying out 1 satoshi per day after the "ICO". 
If future paycoin price is $4.  I'll revise that for you:  "If future PayCoin *is*, period."
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:07:54
Be careful. The Team GAW Kids like and will be sure to come through here and highlight that somehow you're "mining wrong" because they're making money hand over fist with 80-128% "maintenance fees". 
You also missed the memo, you're supposed to be mining "hashpoints" now, which are "coupons" or "IOUs" that will later be exchangeable for "HashCoins" which promise The Blue Sky and A Better Life. (And 500% ROI.)
I'm glad this is coming out. At some point the truth will be louder than the shills.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:10:45
I didn't make it, but I do think this needs to be spread.
