Signing up was instant. I transferred ether over to trade with and took a few minutes. Was able to trade to other cryptocurrencies straight away after that

Our father, who art in Crypto, Satoshi be thy name. Thy confirmations come thy hashes be done on earth as it is in the decentralized ledger. Give us this day our block reward, and forgive us our transaction fees as we forgive those who use fiat. And lead us not into speculative bubbles, but deliver us from inflation. For thine is the ledger, the network and the hashpower.

I see thanks so much for your help. I have 2fa set up and was wondering if I needed to verify to start trading. Doesn’t seem like I have to and can start straight away! Thanks again!

Thank you for the fast reply. Does verification only help for trading large amounts?

Quick question. Do i need to verify to start trading on binance? Or can i just transfer my eth/btc from my wallet and start trading immediately?

Have you lost and money/bitcoin? Otherwise just wait. It took me forever to get verified as well. Ill assume you are from australia. Why not use btcmarkets or independent reserve? They took a day to get verified for me and I personally haven’t had any issues with coinjar/btcmarket/independent reserve. Good luck

BPAY into your Coinjar account and then you purchase Bitcoin. So due to the time it takes for BPAY to transfer your money through, the BTC rate may have changed so to answer your question you get the rate after the BPAY stuff has gone through
