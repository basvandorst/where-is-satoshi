have you guys ever considered that a hardware wallet can be hacked through a firmware update? I still wouldnt trust electronics to hold up for a long period of time . remember we have books that are over a thousand years old. do you think a chip and pc board wont have problems or manufacturing defects that will brick it in the future?

5 months after the wallet was made and deleted from my computer?

bitcoin theft happens all the time.  Imagine having a million dollars or more of btc in your ledger do you think you will sleep safe knowing its in a safety deposit box. I doubt you will. there is no regulation and no safety.  with central authority the owners of the address can be identified and assets retrieved.

No not everybody can handle that responsibility. regulations make banks idiot proof and bitcoin is not. no way is it going to take off and replace the dollar or even gold

They know you have a balance because if your computer has been hacked your repeatedly seen going to check the btc balance of one wallet they for sure know its yours and find a way to get it. either by finding your private keys or actually breaking in.

No central authority to help you if you get robbed.

My opinion is that hardware wallets can be hacked If hackers can gain access to the firmware update server at ledger 
and thousands of users can have their cold storage wallets compromised. I trust no electronics when it comes down to my own money.  My 2 cents.
