because you don't seem to know. mt gox is not doing so hot right now (if it ever was). the whole exchange is on lockdown due to liquidity issues. people have been historically unable to withdraw cash from mt gox. your problems will be much much worse with them. i urge you to reconsider. please do a simple search on reddit about mt gox

Hi. I know this is sorta late as you posted this 5 days ago, but what kind of unique and awesome career are you doing?
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:48:53
Are you kidding. Smart people would have cashed out early in the crash and bought more while the price was extremely low. 
Selling is not a bad idea if you know what you're doing.

A guy bought 500 bitcoins at 1k basically obliterating all of their sell orders. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:37:02
Seeing as you *clearly* are a bitcoin baron, whereas i'm still a bitcoin newbie, I honestly wouldn't mind getting 10x the difference anymore. xD
Eitherway this bet seriously took minutes off my life. Never been more stressed out as during the lul on Sunday and Monday!
Who knows it might actually even hit 1k before Thursday and i woulda won the other bet as well! Teehee
Edit* It hit 1k. I won both bets!!! Woot! Double the reward? :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:30:27
Wait. I didn't see this one. I would rather do this if possible. :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:21:36
Yes. Coinbase gets it's pricing from bitstamp. I think bitstamp is lower than gox because there are HUGE sell walls right now at the 1000 mark. I honestly don't think it'll get to 1k today unless some of those walls come down.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:02:56
which base price?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:42:59
I'm pretty sure I'm too late, but this is awfully kind of you. Reddit makes me so proud sometimes. :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:08:24
Thursday at 12 pm EST good with you?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:05:38
Me too :)
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:40:29

@_date: 2013-11-27 16:18:57
oh you mean a new bet? naw I don't wanna do a new bet right now. I'm burnt out. &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:47:26
I will bet .5 bitcoins that BTC will reach 1k in less than 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:09:36

@_date: 2013-11-27 14:56:36
I'm at work and had to watch the whole thing. I hope I don't  get fired
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:34:18
how do people know that a site is being DDOS'd? Also what is Circle?
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:46:19
Sorry that people are being so mean to you. r/bitcoin can get a bit circlejerky at times. r/bitcoinmarkets might appreciate your post better. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:28:03
Ah I'm so sorry this happened to you. I left Bank of America a LONG time ago. If you can I urge you to switch to Ally bank. I've had no trouble with them. Free ATM everywhere, no minimum checking balance, hardly any fees, friendly, easy and slightly less evil than most American banks. I've also had no trouble with them on the coinbase side.

Hey I don't have much advice. I think it's sad that females perk up to you once they find out you've got wealth. It's weird because I'm the broke/cheap one in my wealthy group of friends and I'm friends with them because I like their company. Also just because my friends are rich doesn't stop me from buying them a beer or covering their dinner just because. What I'm trying to say is that there are people who couldn't care less that you're rich, I think as long as you stay true to yourself, the right people will come along. 
I also saw that you tipped numerous people in this thread and just wanted to say that was very kind of you. Good luck!

Sorry for the slow replies I'm on my phone. I'm in for Wednesday at 12 pm but id rather the pay out be a flat .5 BTC if the oscillations are in my favor or in your favor rather than 10x the difference
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:28:52
I'm an idiot. What is Circle and what is a DDOS?
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:56:37
like say952 said, the reviews weren't the best but I thought it was amazing! Ashton did so well, I was so proud of him.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:01:02
Winning by* a lot i might add! :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:07:05
Holy crap. Out of all the celebrities that are into bitcoin so far, this is my favorite! F all the haters. That 70's Show was great! And so was Butterfly Effect.
Edit: Just looked it up. Apparently Ashton has been into bitcoin for a while! I love him even more. *swoons*
