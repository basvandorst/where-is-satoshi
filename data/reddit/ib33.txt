I kind of feel the same.  Right now I would jump at the chance because I need the work.  But overall, the mining arms race is hotter than white hot and not really profitable for anybody right now.
However, I have been thinking of building my own solar farm, so....

Awesome!  Thanks!

I'm really not seeing anything hardware-related here.  This will definitely go on my 'to check frequently' list though.

I have an account with [coinsetter]( and they recommended [TradeWave]( to get started trading bitcoin automatically.
You think if I did that, it would matter at all to an employer?

My desire to know all things bitcoin and moving to Mexico are indeed unrelated.

I don't think I've earned a job just by wanting one.  I have two degrees in engineering.  I don't feel like they're screwing me.  I'm not looking for a handout.  Just a hand.  Somebody to tell me what I'm missing or something.  I feel like I'm clawing my way up a vertical wall, I don't mind doing it, but I do mind if there's a ladder around the corner.
This wasn't intended to be a sob story.  But I guess it kind of is.
Obviously my github account should be awesome.  Contributions to Angular and React would look really amazing.  I'm not that good yet.  Contributions to my own website probably wouldn't even count for fluff.  It's just frustrating.
Edit:who gives a flip what buttcoin thinks?

I have a BS in Wireless Engineering and an MS in Electrical Engineering.  I took a class in cryptography and understand absolutely everything in the bitcoin whitepaper, ECDSA included.  I don't understand why that, plus all my other experience, is still not enough to get noticed.
Again, it's just frustrating.  Trying all avenues for networking.

yeah, it's not like we're keeping it a secret.  It does make remote work kind of absolutely non-negotiable.  My wife got a job for a few weeks and then got fired on the spot when they found out we were in Mexico.  It was a remote job, and never mentioned being physically located in the US.  "This is not eligible for people in your area."  Odd to me.

I can't tell if it's BTCC pranking him, or him pranking his network, but either way:
Troll level: 100!
