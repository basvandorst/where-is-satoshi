... but you can't withdraw usd from finex. they only deal in usdt
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:05:02
... and you assume someone laundering money wouldn't forge those too?
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:51:38
Yeah and when the auditor cuts all ties and erases all evidence of past dealings from their website it's not a good sign... Especially when the business is supposed to be transparent and regularly audited. Not like the backing matters though, tether's TOS clearly states that they won't give you USD back for your USDT so it's all just play money.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:58:43
Just like stakes in actual productive companies, except nothing at all like that. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:51:31
A stock is stake in the company. A stock has value based on the expected free cashflows of the company, which it pays to the owners or reinvests in the company. Even if a sell run makes AAPL trade at $0.01, the person buying has control over the assets (REAL LIFE THINGS AND MONEY!!) and management. If a sell run brings btc down to $0.01 what the buyer has is internet proof-of-electricity-wasted-in-china pogs that they hope someone will exchange for goods, services or currencies, or more accurately the right to broadcast that their pogs moved to another wallet on the chain.

Sure on-chain transactions can't be forged, but most people "investing" in this crap never even make one, just move numbers back and forth on exchange databases. It's totally understandable for banks to not want to deal with all that, they have actual regulations and laws to follow. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:44:34
Because the pairing on BFX is misleading and says USD when they have no US banking partners and do not deal in USD, only in USDT. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:57:43
You mean "now there's a whale with your money laughing all the way to the bank"
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:11:21
Plus there's zero regulation or investor protection, you aren't **investing** in a company and getting a share of the profits of a growing company, you are buying internet pogs and hoping the value goes up. There's a difference.

People with a vested interest in keeping up the charade say there's nothing to see behind the curtain! Trust us guys, we wouldn't say anything untrue just because we're financially invested in keeping the house of cards stable while we line our pockets!
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:57:45
you can send them usd but what you get is USDT and all trades on finex are in USDT, they have no US banking partners. that is why they had to come up with tethers
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:57:18
Yeah because any drug dealer or human trafficker or CP distributor can claim their dirty money "bitcoin gains" and no bank wants to touch that shit with a ten mile pole, they'll be liable.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:28:08
In that case they wouldn't have any problems with the audits and transparency... So I'm guessing that all the money sent to the shell company in a tax haven is funneled to the owners' accounts or something equally sinister due to the lack of any proof of backing.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:04:32
so without tether there wouldn't be as many buyers for bitcoin (because there isn't enough usd in the market), so the price would drop because people would sell for less and less to get even SOME of the real usd in the market. that's not concerning? billions in fake money entering the market to provide the illusion of liquidity?
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:44:23
Central banks dictate interest rates according to monetary policy, and buy govt bonds to fund the government. There are regulatory bodies that prosecute market manipulators, like we can see from your link. Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:45:42
Unless you're moving hedge fund sized amounts of money and can get good deals with exchanges, frequent buying and selling is a good way to get fucked by fees and taxes. And the whole putting-all-your-eggs-in-one-crypto-basket.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:03:46
It's almost like handling personal finances, long-term saving and investing should be considered general knowledge, taught to everyone when growing up. It's not like putting money aside, investing it and compounding is some kind of black magic ritual only for the elite, it's basic long term thinking.

... the market value of your assets decreases, your net worth decreases, i'd call that a loss. you can say that you didn't lose shit when your house burnt down, but good luck finding someone to buy the wreck for more than what you paid for

Market manipulation and wildly exploitative practices emerge in an unregulated market ��

Money in banks is insured (to an extent). Exchanges can just cut and run with your bits.

It's great to dismiss anyone not with the herd as a doomsayer instead of listening to any arguments against your investment strategy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:22
Bitcoin is worth only as much as someone is willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:34:35
"asset" is a bit much for proof of wasted computing power on a ledger and the right to record a transaction, what makes you think this is something humanity wants or needs? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:09:15
... but bitcoin is currently inflating? More are pumped out daily, not to speak of the bajillion alternatives that have bloomed up. What if there is no demand? What if all it is is a speculative bubble for future economics textbooks to snipe at, an automated 'nakamoto scheme' unleashed at the public, financially ruining lots of speculators and rubes with no clue about sensible investing? Why invest in speculation, hoping this thing will be the fad to take the world by the storm, instead of investing in something that produces income, no matter what the prevailing medium of exchange is? Because everyone wants to Get Rich Quick and become a millionaire by being in early in the Next Big Thing instead of consistently making good financial decisions?
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:26:55
There isn't any real money in crypto at all, just try cashing out ;)
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:33:16
Idk somehow everyone is supposed to give value to moving around proof of wasted computing power on a distributed ledger. Idk why the chinese wasting energy would be valuable to anyone, even if it's "limited issue". The miners can change that if it's in their self interest so it's a completely unreliable promise of a theoretical hard cap.

I'm happy you're so eager to make money off the poor unbanked africans and indians, everyone should hop on to become the new ruling class in control of the monetary supply of the third world. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:11:53
So you have to trust middlemen to route your payments? Wasnt the point of all this to be trustless and peer-to-peer with no third parties?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:39:12
This assumes that people assign value to wasted computing power.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:53:41
I wouldn't want to invest in a medium of exchange (especially one that's "going to be widely accepted really soon just trust me bro"), a good investment produces cashflows with an expected positive NPV for the risk you're taking. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:32:36
Bitcoin is the right to make a transaction on a ledger. You hope that people will give you things in exchange for the right to make a future transaction for an amount of your choosing. If nobody cares about what's on the ledger it's worthless.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:43:30
Wait so I have to give control of my coins to a third party? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:28:23
Beer or weed, you'll lose your money anyway, better get some enjoyment out of it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:21:20
Yes but more coins are constantly entering the economy, the circulating supply is increasing. The fact that there is a theoretical cap doesn't change that. And any value it has assumes that people will assign value to wasted computing power in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:36:51
Money is not an investment. This is why bitcoin is retarded. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:15:34
So much work to skip writing on the ledger when writing on the ledger is supposed to be world changing tech...
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:27:02
... But you have to trust these hubs to route your payments? So it's no longer peer-to-peer or trustless. And any hub routing payments would need to do KYC or risk being part of money laundering schemes. All this to make the "currency" even somewhat spendable with the slow and costly transactions.
