It's a bit off balance. There's more negative space on the left side. I'd move the B to the left a tad.

Wait for the price to drop further. That's worked for you in the past, so stick with your winning strategy.

Completely agree with this. It won't be rationality that'll drive people to gold. It'll be fear.

I believe that people are generally good natured and care about the betterment of society and our world. This video seriously challenges that belief.

Humor is a release valve for intense emotions.

Wake up, sheeple. The sham trial, Mark Karpeles and the government are all pawns in a plan by the Illuminati to enslave the HUMAN RACE. The Illuminati are of course pawns of the lizard people, who are pawns of Satan!!!
Pro tip: Satan is in fact a pawn of Zeulgore the defiler, who is a pawn of Eldargoth the Wise, a being from another Universe called Ghuu.

As soon as I can on android, I will.

Yeah, she doesn't have the identifier, an email from bc.info or an encrypted copy. I'll get her to see if the phone has any leftover files from her original install, though. I didn't consider that. Thanks.

Are you serious? I'd have to be a special kind of retarded to do that, man. I have nothing to gain by this, other than sharing an anecdote with the community.
I'm not sharing the address because I sent her BTC and I don't want my reddit acc linked to my BTC addresses.

We're opposites. I'm extremely careful and methodical about how I organize information. I've never lost a real world wallet in my entire life or a single satoshi of my BTC. Since I've been with her, she's lost her wallet 4 times. Let's just say, it's an exercise in patience dealing with these instances.
