How quickly to make an account and then withdraw to my bank via wire transfer? 
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:37:57

@_date: 2019-03-19 13:33:17
Have you used it? 
@_date: 2019-03-19 08:18:51
Us and the atm here have up charge fee of like 18% with bad BitCoin values
@_date: 2019-03-19 07:19:19
They take like 10 days to sell with bank wire
@_date: 2019-03-19 07:20:12
Have you ever done this? I know of the website but never done it. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 08:14:40
I'm only using BitCoin to fund my offshore brokerage for something else. I don't actually trade or want BitCoin
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:07:23
None have money lol

I used bitquick bc my brokerage let's me trade foreign Currencies by depositing BitCoin instead of wire transfer.
@_date: 2019-08-13 04:52:54
Literally deposited $2400 for bit quick to get BTC.
Then when I was bored at work(car salesman), left to deposit another 1500 lmfao.

That’s the part I’m worried about and want to get this bought and transferred to USD inside my brokerage. So I don’t get messed up by the fluctuations of the market. Might go down in value too. 
Also I trade well enough that idgaf about if I wait and make money. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:54:37
What’s that
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:45:25
I’m a forex trader. I do currencies or precious metals. I do buy or sell depending on y technical analysis. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 05:49:33
Damn wtf
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:41:58
I just hate waiting lol. And my brokerage has a card and PayPal limit deposit if $500 a day. And I’m trying to do 10,000. I don’t like to waste time. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 03:21:17
I found out there is a bitcoin atm near me. Wouldn’t it be just safer doing that?
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:54:17
So not 1 or 2, but 3?
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:56:41
Can’t I buy a bitcoin locally into my blockchain wallet. Then transfer that?
