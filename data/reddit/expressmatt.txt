Try [GoCoin]( You can decide the proportion you want in bitcoin and cash. I work right next to them, so let me know if you have any question!

I work at [expresscoin]( and it's pretty easy to buy if you live in the U.S.
1. Enter you wallet address and place an order on [expresscoin](
2. Pay with money order, cash deposit, check or wire.
3. Receive bitcoin once the payment is processed.

I work at expresscoin and I wish I can tell you the answer, but no one is 100% sure about whether if it's a good time to buy or not. At this point bitcoin is still like stocks with risk involved. Don't spend the money you can't afford to loose on bitcoin. But if you want to give it a shot you can try our service because we don't charge transaction fee for orders under $40 -
