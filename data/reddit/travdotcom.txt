I don't get it ... 
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:25:52
Why is that? I've put a few hundreds into blockchain and now I want to get them back after the bitcoin went higher. Is that stupid of me?
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:55:05
But why is that? I would prefer not too waste money and time with something not profitable ^^

Is it actually worth to jump in buying in at 921$ and sell in the morning if it jumps to 1000$ for example and then sell them? Will I make profit on gdax or do. the fees kill my profit?

It really depends on your needs. Small amounts can be used in a hot wallet, though, since you're not holding the private key yourself, the whole bitcoin idea is thrown over the counter. Web wallets are similar I'd say. Hardware wallets are super safe as you hold the private key yourself which makes you independent which is the overall idea. Android has lots of wallets, though it's quiet common to get scammed on Android. I assume it's easier as I see more people complaining over Android than iOS or other any other OS. 
Anything from Coinbase to localbitcoins will do the job. I hate the rates on localbitcoins though. If you're confident enough, you can start joining fb groups and buy coins off other people. I saved a lot by buying from people that wanna jump out easy and quick.
If you are interested, I found this with a simple google search which will give you an overview. Though, you should not just follow any strangers advice. If you keep doing that, you'll end up quickly being directed by someone. Do your own research always if you care.
