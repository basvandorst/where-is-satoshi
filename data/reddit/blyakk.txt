All science takes some faith
Proof of god=0
Proof of big bang=0
Possibility of God =/0
Possibility of big bang=/0

Really, zero evidence, I guess you have never heard of creation science. I look around I see everything dying and breaking down I never see life coming from nothing.  Even some of our best thinkers are creation scientist I mean just look at Einstein. There's also zero evidence to prove the Big Bang, except that the universe is supposedly expanding. When it comes down to it science can only disprove things, science cannot prove things absolute. Science is really just a bunch of assumptions mounted on more assumptions. And I have yet to see science disprove a god, which makes the chances of god not zero

Atheist: I can't see it so it must be 0% possibility of existing!! wow!!
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:37:28
big bang is all a theory. why do you think its called the big bang *Theory*. not to mention matter coming from nothing is contradictory to current laws physics. like i said, science is just assumptions based on more assumptions. big bang and god are  both possibilities. ill just leave you this conclusion on CMB.
The CMB remains the sole evidence for the big bang theory (Faulkner 2003, pp. 31–34). However, there are several problems with the CMB that call into question its cosmic origin. If the CMB does not have a cosmic origin, then it may be locally generated. If this is the case, then the big bang model is in serious trouble. Naturally, cosmologists will resist this possibility. The recent creation model needs a plausible explanation for the CMB, but recent creationists have yet to suggest one. The proposals to date, emission from dust and an appeal to Eddington’s calculation, are inadequate. Creationists are cautioned to critique properly work on the CMB as evidence for the big bang model. Further work on the CMB within the recent creation model would be most valuable. And we should have the goal of developing a plausible alternate explanation of the CMB within the recent creation paradigm.

Just remember, if faith is for morons, then admit you know nothing. It takes faith to believe your brain is not hooked up to some matrix, rendering all laws physics, science, and your senses useless.
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:53:22
For some reason atheists think it's ok to have faith that our brains are not hooked up to the matrix, rendering science and laws of physics useless. But if you have faith in a god, it's unacceptable irrational nonsense
@_date: 2017-02-21 02:26:19

some replies to his tweets say he is wrong and it will be $5000/btc by 2020, even though thats almost exactly what he tweeted lol

Ain't nobody got time for that

If you sell that mined btc later when its at $10k, you will make plenty of profit
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:30:25
who cares. 1800 coins are mined every single day, and most are probably dumped. your "big deal" is shit.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:10:21
also broken for countless others. may be fixed now, but was a huge issue.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:14:17
is this a joke
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:00:18
So you are speculating that some hard drive data recovery guys saw a bitcoin wallet.dat, replaced it, and changed the creation date info? I guess that's possible.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:57:59
What about how, the bigger blocks will make the entire blockchain get bigger even faster, and prevent more people from being able to host nodes, except for the large companies? It will make it more centralized, right?
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:54:44
NEW ALL TIME HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGH
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:07:26
Yeah myeluim lowest option for a transaction was 300 something sat/byte when I knew for a fact that 80 would have been fine
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:52:01
Because this is mocking that hard drive post that has a 95% chance being troll, I give you my upvote

@_date: 2017-08-16 15:33:15
Lol. The "system" is designed to put more concentration where there is more money. IRS doesn't chase down every single guy who sold $1000 of bitcoin without reporting it
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:30:16

Because there needs to be enough problems to piss everyone off to the point of forcing them to work towards a hard fork. Bitcoin has some problems, but not enough to piss everyone off enough to hard fork.

Sure. but trying to tell me that electron cash is safe, I'm not sure I would call it that, after what i witnessed. I hope to never use that wallet ever again.
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:47:10
If I safely stored my coins off your site, then you tell the irs I sold them and owe them when I havnt made any profit or losses yet? Yep, time to close my Coinbase account

Good explanation

well I guess if you enjoy watching your coin be bricked by spaghetti rushed code because they did not even fix the f2a and multisig 
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:55:17
they did it in sort of a dumb way, but you just need to choose economic first, then swipe around

Wow I didn't know $6000 was a little bubble

Rather pay a few bucks for $10k transaction than trusting some exchange hoping not get hacked
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:19:22
I know its just a few characters called a key, because I have done this before, so I know this from experience. And even if you can open the app, you still can't get any of the private keys from the app, just the output for the websites. I don't think you get how this all works, no offense.
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:27:59
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:53:47
Guys guys, just give your loved ones an empty wallet, and leave a signed transaction unbroadcasted to their wallet, leave this in your safe deposit box. Even if any attacker got the wallet, it's empty. If the attacker gets transaction, all he can do is broadcast it
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:24:58
not to mention he said it was encrypted even though people were saying there was no encryption on wallets in 2009

if its android, there is a way to root it, and get the files where the secret keys are stored for it

If that happens, usd will likely have become useless or inflated( also useless)
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:44:09
same. it wont let me bump either, same error
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:52:32
but there are many times when the blockchain mempool is cleared and a 20sat/byte transaction can go through, just use it then, and use normal exchanges for other times
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:05:46
just let him regret his decision in 5-10 years
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:19:26
yeah I remember the $220 time. I was pretty scared too, it was scary hodling around that time. Emotional traders will not make money this way, and I had to fight my inner emotional trader hard to hodl, I am glad I did.

Yeah, but the way the federal reserve works is even more of a scam

At least you gained something. A life lesson
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:42:09
$150??? I am pretty sure its done on-chain, meaning its bitcoin transaction fees. Who the fuck pays $150 bitcoin fee lol, maybe you need to go and do some more research before blabbing on about stuff you have no idea about
@_date: 2016-10-20 00:36:57
yeah wtf is this i try my first bitcoin transaction in months and even added 20c fee and still 1hr7m since last block 0 conf

Even if he posted a screenshot it, it could just be photoshopped anyways. If coinbas came in and confirmed it could just be a hacked coinbase Reddit account. The fact is there is no such thing as 100% hard evidence. What I initially stated is, in my opinion, good enough evidence for me to believe what is most probable.
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:06:47
has coinbase even denied that it is true? usually you can tell because the company wont deny it when its on the front page like that. thats how you know its true.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:05:29
time to go to McDonald's WiFi and broadcast a signed transaction then :)
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:16:36
Coinbase denying or not denying is the best evidence your going to get when its on the front page, I would bet money they see anything front page about them. I have seen their PR respond plenty of times on front page stuff that they corrected.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:05:54
So they are using bitcoin, which probably wastes tons of coal energy on completely useless hash cracking around the globe, to buy and sell renewable energy????
Edit: they are not using bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:06:51
Well they would have to have some sort of access to my offline encrypted luks Linux hdd, and encrypted wallet, and they are not getting it from me
