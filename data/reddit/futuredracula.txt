Fractional reserve banking is fucked up but absolutrly not a ponzi scheme, put down the youtube and pick up a book

Is inflation any better? I've always understood it to be necessary from the structure of our economic/financial system but I don't see why deflation would be so much more terrible than inflation

Knowing how to use things, yes I could see how that could be difficult. Those people should probably stick to non-solid foods as well to avoid choking

That second paragraph should be in bold, 72pt comic sans. I'm so amazed at all the blockchain innovation already at this early point (color coins, MemoryCoin's board of directors, etc.) it can be hard to fathom what "killer apps"  will eventually be developed

Why do you think they had a conference in Miami? Think about how much paper Western Union is peeling off immigrants
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:41:13
To do so would give away too much about myself

Just when a good discussion gets going someone has to start going overboard with the puns

It's always interesting how a person's stereotyping of others says way more about themself than the target group

Thanks, thinking of it as a tax helped it click in my brain, not sure why I got down voted for asking a mostly unretarded, semi-relevant question

Sup fellow bull, keep in mind we were well above a grand on spec and bullshit, this should push it way way higher and keep it there

The point is that the cops actually give a shit about Bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:06:51
And those people should obviously not be handling investments since they don't understand what a split is, which I first learned of in high school economics class

Yeah, it is FOX

I personally would follow this advice if I was just dealing with a couple thousand that I'm just going to blow anyways, but once you reach five digits or you plan on buying something substantial or re-investing just pay your damn taxes
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:32:03
Such insight, wow

It does mean that a few million people, who haven't heard about it or know of it only in passing, now might take a note of it or look into into it on their own, its not a bad thing for sure
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:08:26
I think that's exactly how they're trying to market Ripple

If you don't like the wild west style of exchanges likes BTC-e and Cryptsy you're more than welcome to enjoy MtGox and all their bullshit you are more than free to do that. Hell, just cash out to fiat and go full on FOREX
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:45:12
Well if you've been using Cryptsy regulary you already know this..

I've ran about a hundred of them that were all claimed to be "false positives" on a bunch of computers and have never had a problem once. Maybe I'm just lucky, my girlfriend can't manage to check facebook and shop online without installing a couple toolbars a week. Of course I wouldn't be so relaxed about security if I had my life savings stored away on that PC
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:19:07
You would make more hitting up faucets, much more
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:12:53
Nobody has the serial numbers of their cash written down and stored away, so this means nothing
