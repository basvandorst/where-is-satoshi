I swear I was sure you were joking because of Boston and Chowder (Chowdah?). TIL, there is a font called Chowderhead.

Holy crap!! Never saw a $200 given right in front of my eyes. Certainly will make feel less steamrolled about the whole deal.

Just received the first installment of 0.2242749 BTC. Good job!
EDIT: My bad. It was 0.001 BTC by the first donor and 0.0000543 BTC by the second donor. I misread the transaction.

Fun fact: Ask your Chinese friend to write sneeze in Chinese and you'd be surprised at how many of them will fail miserably. FYI it is written as 打喷嚏 and pronounced "Dǎ pēntì"

Thanks. I'll add a note.

It is a standard run-of-the-mill arbitrage. People will engage in this form of arbitrage once it becomes practical and that will make all the exchanges converge to a single market value. For the time being the approach has implementation issues due to extreme volatility, sporadic volumes, unpredictable bid-ask spread and a host of other problems. Not to say it can't be done, but I personally wouldn't want to even attempt it under the present conditions.

In your situation I'd recommend using coinbase (not an exchange). They will deposit the money directly in your bank account and they usually provide a good selling price that is somewhat above the current trading price on bitstamp. It usually takes two days for the money to show up in your bank account.

Maybe a majority of Chinese won't have any problem in writing out 打喷嚏, but I've asked this question to dozens of Chinese students doing their PhDs at top universities in the US and till date only one of them could write down the characters correctly. Many of the students had done their masters in Tsinghua and Zhejiang university. Honestly the results also also took me by surprise.

I think they are pretty safe but I still haven't figured out how to save only a part of my BTC onto the paper wallet. The last time I tried the paper wallet feature it saved my entire account onto the paper wallet. Consequently I create my paper wallets offline using bitcoinpaperwallet and sent whatever amount I want to put on the paper wallet.

Came here to say the same thing. Most merchants use a third party service provider who absorb the volatility for a fees. I think it is a win-win situation in the early days for bitcoin as it provides the vendors an opportunity to accept bitcoins and also provides a market for third party service providers who charge far less than credit card companies.

Very true. The indicators mean something when you have sufficient volume at all times. With bitcoins even if you use the traditional indicators their meaning is lost because of lower volume and sporadic spikes in activity. As said, with bitcoins you are basically tossing a coin (even with the indicators).

Can we please get some more information on these funds/accounts as it might of interest to others.  5% guaranteed interest is pretty damn impressive nowadays.

That's the difference, you are lucky to be in Australia. In the US the interest rates are not that attractive. At my bank (Chase bank) a 60 month term deposit (Certificate of deposit in the US) will yield an annual rate of 0.6% (if you have more than $100K :( ). I doubt that will be enough to even overcome inflation.
