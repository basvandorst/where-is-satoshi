I mean let's be fair here, for your analogy to be relevant you'd have to be okay with breeders mating humans and then selling their babies for a living. Which is absurd. And if that were the case, I would still choose adoption.

Did you have a bad experience adopting a pet? If so, that makes sense, at least you tried. If not, respectfully, you have no idea what you're talking about.

That article you linked raises decent points, but it's also pretty obscure and somewhat anecdotal. Anyway, I didn't think it needed to be said that if you're getting an animal, whether it's adoption or from a breeder, it's always a good idea to get to know the pet via a few supervised meetings prior to pulling the trigger. That's irresponsibility on the part of the owner, imo, and is not reflective of the "danger" in adopting. If a dog is aggressive, that behavior will be apparent if you do YOUR due diligence as an owner. Have children? Introduce before you buy. Have other animals? Introduce before you buy. Your argument basically hinges on the idea that people aren't fully vetting the animal and figuring out whether or not they're a good fit for themselves. Spoiler: that's why most dogs (from breeders) are abandoned and become dangerous, nasty shelter dogs to begin with. Please educate yourself. 
Following up on my question from before though, I'm assuming the answer is no? You've never adopted a pet? Yeah. Didn't think so.
