I completely agree with you. The only solution I could imagine wound be supporting a greater variety of exchanges. I hope the market fills in with trustworthy options, the precedent set here is terrifying.

I hope you're selling

I'd recommend it. It also has more detailed information about the market than coinbase, and GDAX will let you make free transactions if you set limit orders properly.

HODL that dog!!

Is it possible to say what kind of sale volume it would take to cause a drop like this? Purely curiosity. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:39:17
Its not off to a great start. He misspelled HODLING.

Provide references please. My understanding is CB staff can't trade BCash for 3 weeks after listing.

I'm glad you did bro, welcome to the party! The more people that respect this movement, that put value in the currency, the better for us all. Keep your ear to the ground and stay up to date on the tech. People have a lot of questions about the state of BTC and the future, get out there and educate people.

We all know Twitter is legally binding. And if you held BTC on Aug 1st it should be in your account presently. Stop misdirecting the problem brah.
Edit: BCH should be in your account presently

Everyone, please down vote these bitcoin.com link posts. Support what you want, but this site, and these posts, are likely a subsidized effort to mislead people newly involved in cryptocurrency.

Loving the respect he throws down for hodlers.

Thanks OP, fantastic resource!

I'm glad i was already at a bar when i got the news.

Want a conversion about on-chain scaling? I respect that. Maybe one about the value of solidarity to a community in this for more than financial gain?
I respect your point, and I have my own, but I don't respect the shallow, toxic, manipulative information he laid on clearly undereducated CNBC anchors. May the best coin win, but I know when I see a salesman desperate to protect his investment. That kind of salesman is not good for any of us.

Thanks so much,  fantastic post.

Fuck off let him enjoy his ride. Welcome to reddit.

If no one else has made a "stop transaction spam" meme by the end of my work day, I'll do it.

I'm no expert, but GDAX limit orders seem considerably more reliable than placing a quick market order on Coinbase. If someone has better info please share.

Thanks for that analysis. It sounds like a frightening precedent for forks to begin setting and I hope the idea gets wiped out quickly. It would be interesting to know his many coins are still in resizable addresses tho.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:31:24
I wish I could down vote this comment twice. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:24:00
Just to be clear here... are you under the impression that coinbase is selling confiscated currency? I don't know anyone who works there, but I know they are sitting on a money printing machine. The absolute dumbest thing they could do would be infringing on customer trust and trading regulations. Also, if you should have BCH post-fork, it should be in your wallet now.
