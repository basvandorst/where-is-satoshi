It is not about the potential. It is about investing before your grandma tells you to invest. And from wanting to invest in bitcoin and wanting to invest in some other crypto currency is just a very small step. One step ahead of grandma is not enough.
ALL cryptos are virtually unusable as actual currencies. It is like deciding if you want cubes or pyramids as wheels for your car: I guess cubes are better, but they are still shit.
A currency to be a good usable currency HAS TO be more or less stable in value. So a good crypto currency is a bad investment. I am not looking for a good currency. I am looking for a good investment.
Right now, my grandma wants to buy bitcoin and the guys who already have bitcoin are running to ETH etc.
You have to be the first guy running in and also the first guy running out. Buy low sell high. Point is: You do not know where to run in until all the guys are running in. And as soon as you know it is already too late.
I have no solution.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:21:33
Is $11.000 high or low, though?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:15:33
People are greedy right now. Everyone who invests in Bitcoins is greedy. They all want these sweet profits.

Bitcoin is a zero sum game.
If you want to profit, somebody else HAS TO make losses. This is how it works. Just be happy if you are sure that you are not the one who makes losses.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:07:24
You do not own the technology behind bitcoin if you have bitcoin.
BTC supply being limited means shit. You can create millions whole new crypto currencies if you want to. BTC will not be better than any of the other million cryptos...

If you believe in gains over the next ten years, why do you think it is so bad to buy in a few months?

When my grandma asked me how to buy bitcoin, I knew it was too late to invest and time to sell.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:34:07
Cryptos may be a good invention, but you do not buy this invention with buying cryptos.
Like emails were a good inventions. Buying an email for $12.000 would be a bad investment, though.
Also, a good currency can't be a good investment, because a key requirement of a good currency is to have a stable value. You can not make a profit with something that has a stable value.
edit: just got banned from r/Bitcoin. So I post the reply to the next comment here:
That token needed to hold value should have a stable value in order to be a working usable currency.
So the reward for using this system should never be the rising value of that token. Such a system will never work as currency. Instead, people will treat it as a stock and use it for gambling instead to buy stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:09:14
That was like three years ago that my grandma wanted an email. No good time to invest in this new start up having this amazing idea of making letters but like for the internet.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:18:21
We can discuss if the number of new investors already peaked or did not peak already.
But can we acknowledge that it is a ponzi scheme if the success depends on the number of new investors.

"As if stocks are any different. Don't come up with the thing that makes them different."
Good one.
And no, economy is not a zero sum game.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:03:23
No. In real stocks, you have a P/E ratio and other indicators, like predictions of future earnings etc.
With bitcoin you have nothing but sheep investing in it. Be the wolf that is ahead of the sheep and you win. Thing is: You never know if you are currently the wolf or the sheep. Most people will be the sheep.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:47:33
Bitcoin went up solely on reports about it going up.
Bitcoin is all about buying before the others buy in selling before the others sell.
You are not making profit with Bitcoin. You make profit with the other guys buying Bitcoin to a worse time than you bought.

So it could be worse or better than 2014. Or the same. Who knows?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:21:58
I see no point in buying in the dips. If you think Bitcoin will go up, you go all in right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:26:23

Even more lol at the people crying for government intervention after alleged insider trade.
Last week you said that being unregulated was an advantage...
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:00:12
It is not a zero sum game.
Transactions cost power. So it is a net loss.

No. Most gold is actually used.

Damn, no! It is not the same at all. Both are stupid things to say. But the market cap of bitcoin is even more meaningless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:01:19
And this moron is you. He is right.
You should do more research.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:00:47
Lol, you really do not understand Bitcoin.
I will sell you one of my fingernails for $900. Then another for $10000. Since the current price is now $10000, you made a huge profit on the first one like the genius you are.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:54:26
The intrinsic value of gold is only a few years behind of the market value.

Are you just going through the thread insulting people that know more than you? Nice hobby, loser!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:43:39


No. You got angry because I pointed out that Bitcoins are inherently worthless and only used as a stock by teenagers who know nothing about real investing.
If you are lucky, you make a few thousand bucks from those stupid teens investing in bitcoins. If you are not lucky, you are one of these stupid teens.
There is literally, like actually 100% literally, not a single way that the average bitcoin investor makes any profit.
Get over it, kiddo. It is a fact.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:41:57
"Only realized profits are real profits"
The only reason bitcoin keeps rising is people not cashing in their profits. As soon as a considerable amount of bitcoin speculators want to cash in their profits, bitcoins will fall.
**The only way to make profit with bitcoins is if somebody else who invested in bitcoin loses money.** Fact! Keep this in mind. The other guys here investing in bitcoin are not your friends. They will either be the ones you got your thousand dollars of profit from. Or they will be the ones you lose your money to. It is just a cold hard fact.
You all see how bitcoin is rising and rising. But statistically, the vast majority of you will miss the point they should have sold. Cold maths.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:36:12
And a 90% drop? 95%?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:43:24


The value of current and possible future dividends is exactly how much a stock is worth. The question is: How much are future dividends worth? People don't know, and therefore prices change. But it is backed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:53:28
No. Regular stocks hold their value because current and expected future dividends. With stocks, you actually own a part of the company and therefore part of the profit this company makes. Bitcoin is not that way, though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:40:27
It is not important. You can google it yourself. I am not helping you to write a scientific paper.
If you wrote "I googled for information about how gold is used, but could not find anything. Can you help me?" instead "lol, you made this up!" I would probably provide a source. But not this way.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:51:56
Classic pyramid scheme: "It will work if others continue to join and I get out before the others get out."
There is literally no way that all bitcoin-"investors" will win. Every dollar profit with bitcoin is a dollar that another guy who bought bitcoins lost.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:36:58


No! Not at all!
A company can actually grow and therefore its stocks are worth more.
The value of a house can rise because rents rise. And even if the value does not rise, you get money from rent or if you live in this house, you save rent.
Bitcoin is different. Bitcoin is not even a zero sum game. Bitcoin is a loss, because electric energy costs have to be subtracted.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:59:45
Wrong. Money is perfectly usable as a currency. Bitcoin is not.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:01:08
All people here THINK they already made a huge profit.
They did not. Not even if they would sell right now. Most will NEVER cash in. It is not possible. The first 10% who start selling will cash in. The other 90% will never be able to sell to the current price.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:38:28
And some other guy puts in $5.000 in bitcoin and misses the right point to sell and will lose it. This is one guy you got your money from.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:44:45
Wait a few years... I hope you will cry!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:48:34


Nice. I buy all apple stocks for 1 Cent and get $10bio dividends per year.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:21:04
So you say normal currencies are bad because their value changes a few percent because of politics.
But bitcoin is fine despite its value is like flipping a coin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:03:06


When why do you care so much that it will rise and not crash?


The opposite is true. The price needs to be stable in order for it's adoption to grow.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:05:37
No, it is not.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:33:16


Yeah, "crashes", but no crash.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:35:09
A dollar also is not an investment.
Nobody ever tells you "Hey, you should invest in money".
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:51


You get filthy rich because you own a fucking company for free.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:10:36
This is one more reason why it will crash even bigger.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:48:20


That is how speculating works. Not investing.
For investing, you consider the actual worth of a company and its future, not what other people will think about it. In the worst case you own the whole company if everybody else thinks it is worthless. And if you are right, you make millions with this company.
It does not work that way for bitcoin. Bitcoin is purely speculating.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:34:36


It is not. And it is entirely irrelevant here.
I think you are the one who learned something. But if it helps you to cope to say otherwise, this is fine.

"You are just a smart investor and read the wiki article about the blockchain!"
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:59:04
Damn, no. Absolutely not. You have to learn the basics about investing:
* Stocks pay you money or promise to do so in the future.
* You need real estate to live in.
* Gold is an amazing material with valuable characteristics that humans needed for centuries.
Bitcoin has nothing of this. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:03:17








@_date: 2017-11-28 12:45:41
Tulips in the 17th century are the only thing that is relevant if you want to compare something with bitcoin.
Because in today's market, there is nothing else like bitcoin. It is not even just a normal bubble. A bubble is if something that has value costs too much, like houses a few years ago. Bitcoin has not inherent value at all. Pretty much like tulips in the 17th century. People only bought it because they thought they can sell this shit for even higher prices in the future. It is exactly like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:16:25
Bitcoin is either a worthless stock or an unusable currency.
Both cases are bad. And your "explanation" is just a perfect example how people who invest in a bubble think.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:48:46
That is a problem! You say it like it is a good thing. It is not. It is a reason to sell and never invest in it again.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:46:38
This is not how bitcoin work.
One million guys buy a bitcoin for $1 and never sell. Several decades later one bitcoin is worth $1mio. One guys sells it for $1mio. The other 999.999 bitcoins are suddenly worth $0. Extreme example, but the point is: You do not generate new value with bitcoin. Some guys put in $1mio. Some guys will get $1mio out (actually even less because energy costs). But it is not like people will put in $1 and later each of them will get back $10. This is simply not possible with the way bitcoins work.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:45:10
Try mining the salt. You will be rich!
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:27:09


@_date: 2017-11-28 14:59:09
Or it will crash and never go over $1 ever again. Who knows?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:37:54
You are talking about a number on a paper that says how much one bitcoin is worth. I am talking about the money you actually get for selling a bitcoin.
If you get money for a bitcoin, someone else put in exactly this amount. So the total worth is exactly the amount people put in.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:55:57


I am pretty good in making stuff up if you consider that I am only 15% off, though. Additionally, I named the two big uses of gold exactly. Or maybe my rectum is just a very good source.

OMG, I was a few percents off. So I was literally lying!
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:37:44


It is not a good thing that bitcoin is almost as stable as the currency of failing Venezuela.

* People explaining why it is totally not a pyramid scheme.
Thanks, I almost missed this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:34:19


The value is not equal to the amount put in. The value is equal to whatever someone puts in.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:56:57
Damn, bitcoin is the best example of a bubble ever in all history.
It is virtually unusable as a currency. People only buy it in hope they can sell it for a higher price in the future.
I can not think of a better example for greater fool theory ( if I tried.
I do not know if bitcoin is $1000 or $10000 or $40000 in 2018. But I know it is below $1000 by 2020. Mark my words.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:41:03
Being transferable and untraceable are not an advantage if this thing is inherently worthless.
It is not like gold. 70% of the gold is actually used for jewelry or in electronics. Only 30% is saved to hold value. Bitcoin is entirely hold to "save" value, but is inherently worthless. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:23:19


Yeah. Now imagine how bad those bubbles would be if we would not need houses at all. Then you have an idea how dangerous speculating with bitcoin is.


It is true. There is stuff much cheaper than gold that is even rarer than gold. But gold is a noble metal and an amazing conductor.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:04:13
Unfortunately, the worth of a bitcoin does not change with how much you study it. You can read about it all day. It is still inherently worthless.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:07:16
Just wait to 2020...
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:09:48
Sounds more like you want to convince yourself and not me, but okay.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:14:22
No, not at all.
And this is the problem with people speculating with bitcoins: They do not know the very basics of investing. I had to explain it a few times already. With stocks you actually own a company, with gold you have a valuable useful material, in a house you and others can live etc. It is not "just like bitcoin".
Bitcoin is gambling. And now the lucky people think they are investment geniuses...
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:49:06
Trading. And saving. Not investing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:31:16
A bitcoin is worth exactly as much as people are willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:05:50


No. You removed a factual statement and replaced it with something one can call wishful thinking at best.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:18:10
A tulip holds more value than a bitcoin, so the comparison is not that good. But you probably do not even know what a tulip is.

I did not say that it is untraceable. You replied to the wrong guy.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:48:03


This is not true. Bolivar only changed by 50% compared to the US-Dollar in the past 5 years. Bitcoin changed more.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:19:41


Because with bitcoin, you do not invest in the way you interact with money. You do not have any rights, any patents. You have nothing.
By "investing" in bitcoin, you do not make money with this idea. You make money by other people investing even more in bitcoin. For every guy who makes $1000 with bitcoin, there is another guy who lost $1050 with bitcoin (cost of enegery). On average, the bitcoin investors will lose money. **Guaranteed!**


You can do this with regular money.
