It's far too common that the most vocal soap boxers are also the least knowledgeable. It is as if they gain some sense of self-confidence in their own language preferences by spouting off utter nonsense about others.

I should be a little more clear. You are very knowledgeable about version PHP 5.3.7, which is the last time you seriously evaluated the language.

I'm all for Bitcoin adaptation, though I don't use it myself. From my understanding, there is absolutely no consumer protection when making purchases, right? I suppose the removal of the whole man-in-the-middle situation is largely the appeal, but I do enjoy some of the protections it offers me to use a credit card (theft, damage, seller fraud). I do also enjoy services like Bill Me Later, which continually offer 0% interest for 6-12 months.
The dream here then, would be to use a credit card to make all online purchases, and then bitcoin to pay the card off. If online retailers start offering discounts to use bitcoin (to avoid transaction fees and chargebacks), that might prompt me to reconsider my purchase method.
In any event, I'm glad to see bitcoiners get another big win here.

You're going to reference a closed bug from 2011 to support your argument that using PHP means a person exhibits a lack of security and sanity? That's just bizarre. You're also referring to a subset of developers that are still actually using MD5, which is boggling in and of itself for anything of importance.
I'm a full time software developer, and while PHP is far from my favorite language, I can hardly call it a poor choice for those that do opt to use it. There are plenty of great web applications that rely on a PHP backend scaling small and large. There is no reasonable web application that I can't achieve with PHP that can be achieved in other  languages with similar performance, organization, and security.
Again, if I had to handpick the language I use on a daily basis, PHP would not be it, but that is purely preference. Your insistence on being vocal regarding a topic that you know very little about is asinine. Surely there has to be a better use of your time.

Perhaps someone can answer a basic question for me. Pardon my naivety, but the value of a bitcoin seems to fluctuate more than that of the US dollar, correct? If that is the case, then how do online stores such as TigerDirect account for that? Do they have some sort of realtime link to the current market value for bitcoins, or do they just set a static price and keep it there?

Stable versions have critical bugs in all languages. Some languages have better track records than others. As ridiculous as the crypto() issue was, it doesn't highlight anything that one can't make similar arguments for regarding other languages.




Wait, are you just trolling now? File upload progress has been natively available in PHP through the $_SESSION superglobal for almost two years now. You clearly have not touched PHP since 2011, which is fine (again, I'm not fond of it either), but please update yourself before making arguments that are stale.

That's just a stupid thing to say.

It's nice to have theft protection lumped into it, which my credit card does provide. This obviously has limitations, but it has saved me on one very important occasion, and unless I desire the relative anonymity of bitcoin purchases, I probably wouldn't have a reason to opt for bitcoin.
Once again, this is not to say that bitcoin is worthless or without merit. I think it is fantastic! I'm just not so sure I need it right now in my life.
