The banks "blockchain" effort will go nowhere. Just as the the large corporations' intranets of the 90s is basically valueless when compared to the open internet. Intranets still exist, but the fools stating they will crush the internet have been silenced and since moved on to thinking the banks "blockchain" will crush Bitcoin. It's laughable how people don't learn from the past.
Societal change takes time. Trust takes time. The thing about exponential growth is it looks linear until it goes vertical. Look at any metric and Bitcoin is undergoing exponential growth.

It'll confirm just give it time. If it doesn't confirm in a few days it will be back in your wallet. You can try to re broadcast with a higher fee if you need it to confirm quickly. The higher fee will confirm first and the network will throw out the lower fee transaction as a double spend. Just be sure you don't send twice the money to somewhere you can't get it back from.

Meh I wouldn't be so quick to say quantum computers kill Bitcoin. From everything I've read it effectively makes it easier to crack. Like going from 256 bit encryption to 128 bit. And only effects broadcasted wallets. If quantum computing became a thing they would immediately go after the satoshi coins (huge central locations of bitcoins with known public addresses). After one of those addresses were compromised we would all know and core could push a patch.

I don't think you will ever be convinced out of your opinion. In ten years time, and even if Bitcoin is used by half the world population and is worth 1M$ you would still say its failed. No one controls Bitcoin. People disliked the way core was heading and decided to write their own code which looks like it may be incorporated. Show me another system where if you don't like the direction you can change it?

That's asinine. People care about value. It doesn't matter the form. Currently the dollar is perceived as strong and trust worthy but that does not mean it always will be. Good money tends to drive out the bad. If you look back at all the leading currencies of the past, the currency that held its value better always beat out the incumbent.

At age 30 you have developed as a person. You've had over a decade of living on your own. Usually married with kids already. And certainly have developed personal finance skills by then. I think 30 is a great time to get money. 
My bias of course is that I'm 29. If I got a windfall next year the only thing I would change is the massive amount of money I'm putting into retirement currently. I'm past the age of blowing money cause it's cool. By not having to contribute to retirement as much I would give myself a 20k raise. Other than that, nothing would change.

Bitcoin is important because it is a verifiable public ledger protocol that can be developed into trading anything of value. It can be developed into a network as complex as the internet with thousands of different applications. 
Bitcoin the token or currency is more important for the unbanked than it is for the first world countries. The majority of the world can't get business loans or any banking solutions. Bitcoin promises to bring banking to everyone. And cut out the middlemen to ensure affordable products. It will spur competition since the barriers to entry are much lower and bring down costs for everything from remittances to asset management.

Just remember Bitcoin sends instantly. You'll see the money leave your wallet and instantly appears in the receivers wallet. Bitcoin transaction settle at the first confirmation. Just like if you send dollars to a brokerage acct. it usually shows up in your trading account immediately but then you have to wait 3 days for the transfer to settle before you can buy stock with it.

Supply and demand. Supply is constant and demand is increasing. It's a positive feedback loop. As the price goes up especially hitting key markers like 1000 and the all time high (around 1200) it gets a lot of news coverage which leads more people to buy.

I would not put anything into Bitcoin that you need in less than a year or two as an investment (little amounts to play with or buy stuff is fine). I would choose the guaranteed 9% (if it really is guaranteed). We may be entering a bubble or maybe not, but that's the point. If you believe in Bitcoin for the long term you should invest and hold but don't only give yourself a few months because anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:59:54
Bitcoin the currency is just a representation of value of the Bitcoin network and immutable ledger. Both of which have huge implications in the future innovation of the internet. Buying one now is like buying a share of stock in the internet in the 90s. (Not a tech stock but if you could have bought a share in the internet itself). As we know now, the internet changed our entire lives and permeates all of society. Bitcoin the network/protocol is no different. When Bitcoin reaches the level of infiltration in our society as the internet has then the value of the token Bitcoin will level off and drastically reduce in volatility at which point it will be a valuable medium of exchange that could rival the dollar (maybe). This infiltration may happen in the background and might not even be obvious to most people just as most people don't know the internet runs on the TCP/IP protocol. In the meantime the Bitcoin token (of which you can buy) is a speculative asset and not really a viable currency. You are speculating that there is value in an immutable global borderless ledger backed by the largest most powerful network in the world.

Don't revise history. It was literally said for each of these technologies. Some people said the World Wide Web would never catch on because you could never find anything.

Go to coinbase or circle. Buy Bitcoin.
Then open your personal wallet like copay, Jaxx, mycelium, or breadwallet and transfer the bitcoin from the exchange (coinbase or circle) to your personal wallet.
Also you need to back up your personal wallet in case you break or lose your phone. You do that by writing down the 12 word 'seed' on a piece of paper. Your personal wallet should prompt you to do this when you set it up. Store that 'seed' somewhere safe.
