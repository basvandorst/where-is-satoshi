**This is not true!**
Here is my conversation with support at BTC-e
 My account was HACKED!
reported an hour ago
I was hacked. My password has been changed and when I try to email myself through the site to reset my password, nothing happens. I have seen that quite a few people have been hacked and robbed.

Hi Da***********es,
As i can see you are not hacked, you just have wrong email (da***************es login with it, and change to new one. I recommend you to confrim it.

This is so wrong! I wanted to log in before the crash and I was not able to. I was using "da****************es every time i tried to log in, but I kept getting banned for 30min because it said wrong password. Right when i say it was hacked, i get an immediate response and "magically" i can log in now. This is fucking unacceptable.
Can you explain why your system said I was providing the wrong password when I was not? I feel like I was scammed.
So, do you care to tell me why my password did not work this morning and now it magically works, AFTER the crash?
**TL;dr My BTC-e password did not work for 6 hours. When I reported my account hacked, all the sudden I had access to my account, AFTER the crash today...SCAM**
