some venezuelans are basically giving Bolivars cash money away begging for alms here in bogota. I guess i could help you with that if you need.

can anyone eli5 ?

you could still use candlesticks to see it, the main difference is the amount of info you are seeing (as you are watching the amount of trades made instead of bundle them in a particular time lapse). i feel its better because you can see the attempts to manipulate the market.

[like this one]( when the chart shows ticks over amount of transactions instead of over time. not sure how to explain it tho :(
Edit: put in the options tick by tick
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:39:39
Downloading, does it have tick by tick?
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:56:05
either way your app is super clean and cool. i love the minimalist functionality.
@_date: 2016-10-27 18:49:31

@_date: 2016-10-27 19:27:49

@_date: 2016-10-27 19:56:47

@_date: 2016-10-27 20:12:14
thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:09:25

@_date: 2017-06-14 22:20:38
the volume of sells is real tho
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:23:35
you know what that means :( STRONG HODL
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:01:12
ooh my bad. i wasn't aware of bitmain statement. Now that's what i wanted to hear! thanks man.
[Now im able to see]( where this drop came from
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:32:40
I'd say localbitcoin les scrpulouse
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:30:05
Its just becouse they wanted to nationalize* theyr own crypto right?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:43:45
but are you saying this "talk" includes the whole market?
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:15:49
24xx ! my man is buy time!. can anyone explain what's motivating this drop?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:41:14
not having more money?
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:44:43
im in the exact same situation, will have to empty my alts portfolio!
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:47:11
but that's like a month and a half away right? drop starting today? i'd say that's very unlikely
Edit: maybe after reaching around 3200 will drop heavily 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:46:08
i know it's nothing new, price fluctuation is part of btc. but there's always something that motivate those fluctuation 
(I know it is driven by people, but what motivate the people?)
