You're absolutely right.  It seems that a lot of supporters of burst and poc in general argue that the ability to use the hardware for other things is a good thing, in that if it goes south you haven't completely wasted your money/there's less waste of resources in general, though that does assume that they find another use for their 200+ tb of storage space xD

Potentially, but it seems there are still returns to scale to having a large mining rig, just based on stats.  If your goal is to roll at least one number that's 2 or less, that's more than twice as probable if you roll 4 dice than if you roll 2.

Ah, gotcha. Yes, I agree that's a fair point.

Couldn't this be modeled as the people who have more than the average inflation rate are taking purchasing power from those with less than the average inflation rate?
(I'm using "inflation" to mean increase in the money supply, not increase in prices.)

Maybe, but wouldn't it take a while to plot all of that?

I think this is a fair point. The marginal cost of burst is lower, but the question is how much people are willing to invest in order to try to get future profits, and that gets really complicated to analyse when interest rates are as distorted as they are right now.
