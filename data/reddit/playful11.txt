"Two officials of the Bangladesh Bank (the central monetary authority of Bangladesh) were also reported to have visited the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to demand the return of the funds that were allegedly stolen by hackers based in China from its accounts with the US Federal Reserve."

Don't down vote me for the title.  READ the article
Computer hackers hacked into the accounts at the US FED RESERVE held by Bangladesh Central Bank.  So yes, the funds were stolen from Bangladesh BAnk, but they were US FED RESERVE ACCOUNTS!
They don't want to say the Fed had been hacked as the title, perhaps?
THIS IS HUGE FOR BITCOIN!

Incredible.  This bodes well for bitcoin blockchain protocol.  Private walled garden used by R3 banking consortium is just too vulnerable to internal and external breaches.  What happens when billions of fiat $ begin to go missing?

Good article.  It appears to me that even if R3 big banks pursue the private blockchain/walled garden approach, that a multitude of smaller community banks and credit unions would utilize the bitcoin blockchain.  One monumental FAIL within the walled garden, a breakin or hack, and many people will demand the major banks move onto the public blockchain.

Woah... This needs to be highlighted and posted everywhere.  While this has to do with Mike Hearn and his resignation to jump ship and join forces with banksters to perhaps work to the demise of Bitcoin, it has much info re the underlying "thinking" of the R3 and their manipulation of regulators to their ends.  The arrogance is palpable.  Thanks for posting

Thanks for this.  I would like to believe this was the case, but I think there needs to be more investigations.  In any event, it's only a matter of time that the system becomes compromised, from either inside sources or externally through computer hacking or spying.    
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:09:00
Yes, the article obfuscates it, but the reality as I understand it is that FEDERAL RESERVE ACCOUNTS WERE HACKED!  
The accounts were held by Bangladesh and used to buy US Treauries.

Just takes another Lehman Bros belly-up event.  he banks are highly leveraged.  When they come after and confiscate individual saving accts., that's when the real fun begins.   After all, from a legal perspective, our bank acct funds are technically a loan to the bank and do not belong to us.  We have willingly loaned those assets and they reside with the bank.  Try getting them back when the caca hits the fan, derivatives explode and the leverage unravelling begins.

This Billon crypto cash intrigues me as well as causes me some consternation, as I hodl bitcoin.  As I understand this, those who use Billon do not need a bank account.  Only those who wish to convert the cryptocash back into fiat.  So like bitcoin, it creates it's own economy and can help introduce the unbanked into the cryptocash economy plus with 0 transaction fees?  I would like to know more about the power use of bitcoin as well vis a vis legacy banking overhead.  So many questions...

And if the bitcoin foundation is a non-profit, can't they get $10k-$40k of google adwords per month to promote an understanding of bitcoin and it's transformative potentials?  Great messaging here that is empowering particularly with people recently disenfranchised and unemployed by legacy institutions.  Bitcoin allows a re-design so that money and creative content is disintermediated and can be owned by the unique individual.  Calling all creatives, Burners, artists and more.... Technology can now work for you!  It's time to recreate ourselves and coherent messaging for the movement is needed.  Mark my words, if bitcoin doesn't claim this, it will be hi-jacked.  Where is the bitcoin foundation on this?  PS I feel like I'm talking to myself

Then why can folks using UK based bittylicious buy ether using euros?  They don't have to buy bitcoin first and then buy the ether.  This does not describe a peg to me.  This describes a stand-alone cryptocurrency where the use of bitcoin is not required.  To me this appears that ether could become more robust and replace bitcoin?  Somebody who knows, please set me straight?

Is the message that banks are vulnerable, insolvent etc the way to promote bitcoin? This sounds like chicken little crying the sky is falling, or crying wolf, upon the ears of the uninformed.  Instead, what messaging can be used based upon the merits of bitcoin technology and ease of use can be or will be used to promote the Internet of currency?   Does it have to be logical? Maybe it's an image problem?  If rap can do it, associate and promote thug behavior as hip, why can't bitcoin?  Just thinking out loud here...

I get it.  however, just like we have become mind-numb to the on-going banking ripoff, perhaps many numbskull innocents  become passively accepting of the hackable and insecure scenario, particularly since it can be argued as the cost of doing business.  Our enslavement has deep mental chains...?

If you think I was claiming that trolls who patent pre-existing things are the winners by default, I would like you to know that was not my intention.  My intention was to bring what little patent knowledge I have from recently being granted two software patents post-Alice decision on inventions.  With the Alice decision, it is very difficult to jump through the requirements for a software patent, and that is as it should be.  You are right, patent trolls make life difficult, and just as difficult are those huge companies which hold patents and do nothing with them  to legally preclude further 
innovations.  I was simply trying to say, pehaps albeit poorly, that if they can patent this inventiion or its new manifestations they will, and the one holding the patent will prevail assuming they can defend it.  It takes money to defend one's patent, as the court cases go on for years, and the one with the most money wins.   Banks have money.  
It's a nasty business.  Sorry if you took any offense to my

Patent applications are first to file for claiming territory.  The date stamp is what matters.  It will take at most 18 mos going fast track to get a decision and otherwise, getting a hearing is at least 2 years.  Who wants to spend their lives following all these applications and opposing them?  The best defense is an offense.  File first.   Best opposition is the date stamp and/or prior art I think.  But I don't know if open source can over-ride patent law... Probably not.  But I don't know...

Backbone to other currencies and applications,yes. What would make bitcoin the favorite?  What would cause it to be such when other currencies could be mined or used?  I hope you are right, as I am a holder, yet this has never been done before and the block chains will develop in ways unforeseen
