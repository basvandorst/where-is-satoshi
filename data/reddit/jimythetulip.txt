I feel really bad for the noob collateral damage that will result from LN implementation. Just try to educate people as much as you can before that happens. 
Ver, Jihan and McAffee are miners. They don't want LN. They want to keep everything on chain for their own benefit. The only reason BCash exists is because of LN. If LN wasn't in the works as a scaling option they wouldn't give a damn about fees and transaction times because they'd just be making more money. 
Talking about Satoshi's true vision is an effective way to swing in the noobs. If Satoshi didn't want changes to the protocol he wouldn't have made the project open source. 
In the end the market will decide.

I have a family member that works at a coin shop in Canada. He has been telling me that people have come in liquidating their personal physical holdings in hopes of purchasing bitcoin. It's annecdotal evidence but if I was a coin dealer and I was noticing the trend that people are only selling, I would think about shifting my business somehow to cater to the new demand.

There are some bad actors in this space. Ver, Jihan and McAffee are all miners. They want Bcash to be Bitcoin so that they can keep all transactions on chain and secure their mining empires. 
Bcash has been gaining ground over the last little while. This was all no big deal 
BUT 
The fact that coinbase aligned their surprise Bcash trading launch with a bitcoin difficulty adjustment PLUS they still haven't rolled out SEGWIT is very concerning. 
It makes me think that Miners + Coinbase are pushing for Bcash. 
I'm sure coinbase doesn't like the idea of atomic swaps and trading without exchanges. All of these groups are threatened by LN and the collusion and coordination between these groups has people in this space feeling very uneasy. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:52:59
I think you have it down. It's very surprising to me how people can gobble that shit up while not being suspicious of the miners that are all pushing for BCash. Ver, Jihan and McAfferr are all Miners. 
They have a financial stake with keeping everything on chain. That's it. That's the only reason we are doing any of this bullshit. 
If it wasn't for miners looking to secure more profit, no one would have any issue with LN and Segwit.

@_date: 2017-12-11 04:49:25
They can't buy actual bitcoin. They don't have the mechanisms in place to securely hold private keys as institutions without running the risk of theft or loss. 
So the only way they get to gain exposure as an institution is through the futures market. In order to do so, they need to have a willing party take the other side of the bet. 
The institutions buying a future at 18k are doing so because they believe it will be 20k but they can't just get a trader to go buy millions in actual bitcoin and trust that he holds the private keys properly.

Hey, I have no idea what will happen, I'm just not as bearish as everyone who seems to be panicking right now. I think it's not unreasonable to assume that one of the potential outcomes is that when everyone sees that the price isn't being shorted into the ground, everyone who panick sold out will FOMO back in. This price increase might in turn be viewed as wallstreet bullish on BTC and cause even higher highs. Or maybe the price takes a huge dive. who knows. Right now I am much more scared of selling than I am of hodling.

Cryptocurrencies are an asset class. Not a stock. It's also an asset class that hasn't ever existed before and now it does. So many are (correctly in my opinion) viewing this as the beginning of an entire asset class that has a frightening level of scarcity (when talking about bitcoin).

@_date: 2017-12-15 15:03:49
You should also consider who is pushing BCash. Ver, Jihan and McAffee. All of these people have large scale mining operations. 
If bitcoin successfully scales with Segwit and LN, miners will not earn as much money. So they push their big block coin because if it's successful they stand to make huge profits. 
The Satoshi's true vision narrative is just used to pull in the naive to buy their shitcoin.

This is fine. It creates volatility until it balances out. Every time a whale dumps a 1000 coins, they get spread out to new people in the market eventually stabilizing the price and reducing volatility.

From here  
Will I be able to trade bitcoin futures?
In order to buy or sell bitcoin futures contracts, you'll need to have a futures account with your broker. Brokers will make their own individual decisions about whether to allow customers to trade bitcoin futures, so you should check with your broker upfront to make sure that you'll be able to trade. Moreover, brokers can impose their own margin requirements above and beyond what the CBOE itself requires, so you'll want to ask questions about your broker's own policies when you consider using bitcoin futures.
Also, this might be helpful

This is the type of reasoning that has me worried the most. People don't realize that if it wasn't for SEGWIT and soon to be LN, Bcash wouldn't even exist. 
SEGWIT removes the ASIC advantage that Jihan has and LN will reduce the number of on chain transactions. 
They want to scale ON CHAIN to make more money and secure their empires. 
Do you really think it's a coincidence that Ver, Jihan and McAffee are all miners and they're pushing Bcash? 
There is a perversion in the crypto space happening now and it's disguised as a free market decision. 
No Segwit adoption by coinbase yet they rollout Bcash by surprise during a difficulty adjustment. There is collusion and fuckery happening now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:02:03

We will create the outcome we reward. If we reward forks we are only going to have more forks until the entire crypto space is diluted into nothing including the alts. I don't understand how some people can view this shitshow as providing an opportunity for this alt, or that alt, or this split etc. The entire space is being attacked. It helps no one but fiat and banks. You think you're going to get adoption for your alt after Bitcoin is unseated? Bullshit! Gaining adoption is hard enough as it is. It will be impossible after the media can point to the actual demise of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:16:57
nope. Not like bitcoin. A centralized blockchain in the hands of a private corporation will never be as large, secure and robust as a decentralized incentive based system.

Did you ever consider that the need to move larger quantities of money around the world to escape from restrictive governments might one day turn into buying your coffee?

You should consider moving bitcoin off exchanges and cell phone wallets. I'd recommend getting a trezor or a ledger and moving it there for added security. Hardware wallets are the way to go especially if you're not considering cashing out or trading in the near term.

The fees are temporary. The brightest minds in this space are working on this issue now without risking further centralization. What would be really stupid is to flip over the monopoly board just because you don't like the current fees. 
May I also remind you that retailers accepting visa pay 3% on their transactions and they're also exposed to chargebacks. 
You guys who keep toting the fees sound ridiculous. Liquidity is what matters. I know that I can liquidate my bitcoin anytime and there will be buyers there. It has a track record. Large scale institutions are buying in. 
No one is going to put their net worth in bcash because there is no way to know if there is going to be anyone here in 6 months willing to take it from them. 
Right now the only application Bcash has is if you are in the market to buy a mining rig from Jihan. 
Not off to a good start.

1) All the scumbags in crypto are behind it. Wu, Ver, Mcafee, Faux Satoshi 
2) The Cashening already failed last week 
3) It is a bump and dump coin. Which is exactly what everyone thought it was to begin with. It's been confirmed. You may attract people who want to make a quick buck on the weekend pumps but that's it. 
4) Everyone hates it. You'd have a better chance taking over with a coin not named bitcoin cash. Everyone is looking for any opportunity to make fun of it. It's become a joke. Bitcoin Cash Plus+ is coming out and bcash already forked and now theres Bitcoin Clashic. It's a laughing stock coin 
5) Too many people have already been financially ruined because of the travesty that took place last weekend. The people who were burned hard were the ones that lost faith in BTC when it got a bit tough. Those people all got fucked. The ones left are the hardcore BTC fans. None of the people who took massive hits will ever buy Bcash again. They'll buy BTC. You can keep your fees bro. People lost thousands. They could have paid high fees their whole lives. 
6) Every single day we are hit with awesome news about the actual bitcoin Huge tech advancements(lightning network swap between blockchains Litecoin &amp; Bitcoin) and more corp adoption (coinbase announcing enterprise accounts and not just personal + Square Cash offering. 
7) literally go and view any youtube video on bitcoin cash and then read the comments underneath. It should give you a good idea about market sentiment. 
 
8) Any other legit alt coin has a much better chance than bcash at this point. There's just too much heat on it. It started the whole thing on the wrong foot. It could have done wonders if the people behind it weren't so combative and were actually more collaborative. But if they were so, they probably wouldn't have forked off in the first place.

This is a great idea but part of me wants to see bitcoin succeed whether Warren Buffet likes it or not. Also I'd hate to see the headlines when he still thinks it's a scam.

Don't worry dude, the fees will come down. No reason to flip over the monopoly board. This is some serious shit.
Right now bitcoin is serving a market. Did you ever consider that the need to move larger quantities of money around the world to escape from oppressive governments that want to prevent capital flight, might one day turn into buying your coffee or selling a mango for a few pennies? 
I have no trouble buying coffee. Nobody in the world has problems buying coffee. I have problems with governments preventing capital flight and trying to lock me up if I move my cash. 
We are literally subverting world governments as we speak.

Did you ever consider the fact that countries that have the biggest problems with capital flight would be the ones most hostile? 
Failing economies, or economies more concerned with capital flight will be more hostile toward bitcoin. For the United States, Bitcoin is currently a vehicle for people to move their money INTO the U.S. Governments all over the world are not on the same side with perfect consensus. Some will benefit greatly from Bitcoin. I think Japan has this in mind.

Totally agree. What gives a fork value? Bitcoin in existence was mined over years and years. It cost money to power those mines and set them up. All of a sudden your fork exists and didn't cost you shit to distribute these "free" coins to everyeone? We have gotten so used to defending against the ponzi arguments that we totally miss the boat when we see one right in front of our faces. Maybe I'm off base with this but if there was no underlying work to attribute value to a coin, how does it have value? Future utility isn't enough for me.

Would you not go into the store pick up the item and deliver it in the evening if you can make some money from the transaction? Wouldn't it be a green alternative to help your neighbor out, help the environment and make some cash in the meantime? 
The highways are full of commuters, what if all those empty cars were also delivering packages?

Once you deliver the item and the receipt and receive you bitcoin payment, it's none of your business. If the buyer is unhappy with the product, they can return it to the retailer. 
As an aside, it would be a great way to anonymously accumulate bitcoin by buying consumer goods for your neighbors.

@_date: 2017-11-08 22:02:03
It's just greed masquerading as virtue signalling. Shaming you to get in because they think they got in on the ground floor. The ground floor is waaaay lower. 
We would all love to see people in 3rd world countries selling mangos for pennies using Bitcoin. Everyone wants this eventually but not at the cost of centralizing the system, not acting with consensus and reducing security. 
But the idea that they can displace Bitcoin and calling themselves Bitcoin because *It's what Satoshi would have wanted* is something I have no tolerance for. It's not up to Roger Ver's interpretation. 
This is a long game, quick fixes should be worrisome for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:13:24

It's obviously hard to say at this point. Was the internet valuable in the early days when it didn't do anything? Most people thought personal computers were a fun and useless novelty in the late nineties. In the future we may have things like car sharing programs where you walk up to a car, scan a qr code and the door unlocks and the car is enabled for you to use. The car has it's own wallet, drives to a service station and pays for it's own service. Vending machines may use their own wallets to buy their own products to sell to the public. Bitcoin has the potential to unlock an entire machine economy that is barely even conceivable at this point. What is the "intrinsic value" of that economy?

The veracity of this claim was questioned earlier today by u/smeggletoot. Here is what he said. 


The Shargh newspaper cited as being the primary source for this 'news' hasn't published (at least online) a single article mentioning bitcoin [See: Google Search "Shargdaily.ir bitcoin"]
    Iranian Deputy Minister of Information and Communication Technology, Amir Hossein Davaee
A quick Google search for Amir Hossein Davaee returns only links to financemagnates and a bunch of other non official news portals (all of which cite Amir Davaee only in relation to this bitcoin 'news' story).
Remove sites mentioning bitcoin and there are a grand total of 9 search results for "Amir Hossein Davaee" -Bitcoin none of them in relation to the Iranian ministry of ICT.
Further, there's no mention of Amir in the Wikipedia entry detailing the Iranian ICT leadership.
It appears the actual deputy of ICT is Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi.
TL;DR: Not credible information. Feel free to strike 'financemagnates.com' and associated 'news' sites carrying this 'story' off your trusted source list.

Crypto currencies will allow you to move money easily and globally. It will allow you to transact with whoever you like without a third party. I'll be able to automate my will to send my bitcoin balance to my kids when they turn 21 without the use of a bank or a lawyer. I'll be able to buy a car sitting on a lot just by scanning a QR code, have that title transferred to me through that transaction on a public blockchain. Instead of earning airmiles, loyalty programs will adobt their own crypto currencies. Joining a gym will be as simple as reading the terms and sending money to a QR code on the front door my membership will be on a public blockchain. The applications for crypto haven't even been dreamed up yet. It's like saying what's the point of the internet in 1995 when the internet didn't even do anything. The innovation that will come from crypto in the next 5 - 20 years is impossible to predict.

You can make this personal if you like but it doesn't change the fact that people should not be keeping large sums on an exchange. It's a massive security risk that we have seen play out before. If you have an argument against that, I'm sure everyone would love to hear it.

Today is very similar, it's really hard to imagine all the different ways in which bitcoin will creep and grow. There may be a time in the future when we can't imagine doing without it and the way things used to be.

From my experience traders aren't doing as well as HODLers.

You would have wider appeal with more payment options. But this system would allow for the vast majority of the cost to go directly to the delivery person. Different payment methods may be cost prohibitive in terms of transaction costs.

I hadn't thought of the implications of creating a steal on demand situation. You're right. The requirement of a receipt is an easy solution. People would want the items paid for in cash with receipts provided. Those things could be implemented into the system. A user experience voting system could be introduced at the end of the transaction. If delivery person doesn't provide receipt, they receive poor ratings and could no longer receive grabbit notifications.

I was trying to think of ways to allow people to unlock the ability to purchase common everyday items without having corporations agree to and embrace the idea of bitcoin. Let me know if you have any questions on the concept or if you have any critiques or insights of your own.

I would gladly put bitcoin all over my city if this sort of game was legit. Sort of geocaching bitcoin. Sounds like fun.

Keynes is the main reason why current central bankers have been inflating their currencies for the last 30 years. If fiat currency held it's value, there would be one less reason to own crypto. The dollar has inflated 2369.9% since the early 1900s. This inflation has been the direct result of adopting the Keynesian economic framework.
