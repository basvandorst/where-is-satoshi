And this is the comment I was hoping to see. Thank you, reddit

Ok that seems more or less what I expected. And explains why I got my SMS code (I use ATT, though I actually had to request it twice before I got it). 
It sounds like Coinbase could cause serious issues for anyone wanting to sell asap in the case of BTC going down...though all the optimism I'm hearing makes me thing that BTC going down just means it's time to invest.

Wow! Surprise there.
So you would suggest something like BTC-E for investing in btc? I do plan to make some purchases with btc but I'm definitely jumping on now with hopes to make a buck.

Hm interesting, different banks for different utilities. It's so alien to me since Banks I know work entirely differently, but that's the point.

What is that in relation to coinbase? Same thing or a tool coinbase would use? I made my account, verified my phone and started the process on my bank account recently (as I'm just now deciding to finally dive into the bitcoin hype). I am completely in the dark here.

Yeah that seems simple enough. Now I just have to understand Day Trading enough to see if it's worth it. With how volatile BTC is I feel like you sort of need that rapid access.

Banks and governments may not have done everything they can to destroy Bitcoin, but I don't think the users have done everything they can to advance Bitcoin.

The whole wallet system definitely seems the sketchiest/riskiest part of Bitcoin from what I've gathered so far. It may be fine not to worry about it now but if I want to/plan to make money out of it I want to make sure I'm not LOSING money.

Is it too late to start buying?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:34:47
Well..that makes me feel not great having just opened an account with them....

Is it still going up? I highly regret not investing when it crashed after the SR incident and was waiting for it to go down some again before reinvesting.
