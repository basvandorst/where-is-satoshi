This is Bobby from CoinGecko. The website is now back up. There were some errors on the server and we were on a long-haul flight and could not fix it earlier.

Hmm that seems odd. Can you PM me the email address used to access the dashboard? We will need to check further. Thanks

Have you tried looking at the solution offered by [BlockCypher](
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:12:17
Thanks mate! Drop me an email at bobby and let's discuss further :)

Hi guys, I'm Bobby, the co-founder of [CoinGecko]( Thank you to Coin Academy for conducting this interview. If you guys have any question feel free to ask me here :)
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:35:46
Awesome! Emailed you for my tip ;)

I would say [CoinDesk]( is the most reliable and trustworthy publication.

Hi I'm Bobby, the editor from CoinGecko. Sorry for this error by our writer. I've corrected the list.

Yup, the BTC-USD price on the price chart page is calculated as a weighted average of Bitcoin exchanges worldwide

Good job Luis!
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:03:56
Probably not with OneWeb

$116 million in funding. You tell me how to burn that much cash!
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:04:44
if the claims made by the author are true, it will be pretty devastating for the community as a whole
@_date: 2015-04-11 04:42:13
But fee for Paypal or Bitcoin are both 5%. Shouldn't it be cheaper for Bitcoin?

Bobby from [CoinGecko]( here. Corrected the header formatting to show the reasons more clearly:
1. Spam Registrations on the Namecoin Network
2. Namecoin’s Small Development Community
3. The Centralization of Mining in Namecoin

There are many! From bitcoin remittance, exchanges, ATMs, smart contracts etc

This is Bobby, co-founder of CoinGecko. We paid Kyle to write the article. No money was received from 21 Inc. at all for this article.
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:06:03
Give it some time. The 21 computer just got released. I'm sure some interesting projects will come about soon
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:10:45
I LOVE this idea! No more late to work days with this alarm clock!

I recently wrote a post on the 14 Bitcoin Blogs You Must Read To Achieve Bitcoin Enlightenment - 
Thought you might find the list of blogs useful
@_date: 2015-03-12 12:57:16
Just to add on. Here are 14+ other blogs written by other Bitcoin thought leaders
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:52:09
Some of the blogs are cryptocurrency related but there are quite a few on the list which writes very insightful things on Bitcoin such as Tim Swanson, Richard Gendal Brown, Organ of Corti, George Samman and William Mougayar. It's mostly Bitcoin people which I respect very much.
