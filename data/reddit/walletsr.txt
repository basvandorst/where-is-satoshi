What if I bring my btc back over to gdax to they cover the fee?
It seems like a good incentive, do other exchanges offer free transfers?

The weak hands are getting shaken out. That's what happens when people try to get rich quick.  As soon as there is resistance everyone fears the worst and pulls out.  
The market is just balancing itself out you have to look at longer market trends than 24 hours..... Unless you are daytrading you shouldn't react to a 5% retraction when it grew 12% over the last 7 days and only 150% for the month... (sarcasm)
These parabolic moves are unsustainable therfore, it needs to stabilize before it makes a bull or bear move...
If you lost money already then your entry was poor and you didn't understand the market.  Before investing again I would review my strategy and review what happened in the market during my holding time.

Upon further review the first few block chains may be Satoshi and contain a few thousand coins.
Its more likely that if he held the coins they would be disbursed so that it didn't gather attention.  It's more likely that If Satoshi wanted to hold Bitcoin it would have been done overtime just like everyone else.

How would someone like Satoshi or the Twins liquidate their large holdings?

I utilize multiple exchanges to get an overview of the true market price.  There are variances across coinbase, gdax.com, bitfinex, and any other exchange.  I utilize gdax.com to trade my coins.  If I want to see what the market is doing I look at exchanges such as gdax.com to see where the bids or sells  are stacking.
I would read basic trading g fundamentals on investopedia so you can understand the trading psychology and patterns

Great point, it's up to each person to set there acceptable losses before entering.  Also, remember that it can't always move up, it can go down as soon as you enter.  I tend to set my losses at previous support or resistance lines.
With an entry if sub 20k trying to go for that break of resistance, my stop loss would be at 18.2kish  as it was resistance on the 7th, 13th, and 14th.

What about when I move it off my Nano s and put it on a different exchange, I eat the mining fee?

Typically resistance is at round numbers that everyone thinks is a barrier to overcome in this case it happened to be 20k.  I also thought it would have been 25k as I believe many others did.  Looking at the price of 19616 it. I would assume you bought 16 hours ago or 27 hours ago. 
If that's so then you would had seen the resistance in the exchanges and the wall stacked at the 20k threshold.  When you look at the exchange you can see how many sells are set at a given price.  Last night there was around 1.2k btc sitting around that 20k mark.
That was a sign of resistance and would have taken either a whale purchase or a large volume increase. Neither of which happened and therefore resistance held.
The people that hold large outs of btc are more than likely financially savvy and day trade.  I would recommend looking into basic stock trading strategies
