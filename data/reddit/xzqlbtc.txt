Yes, you are correct there my friend. Bitcoin is very versatile and you only need a phone to use it and you can use it whenever, wherever even if your country is on blackout because other parts of the world will continue. If ever you need of an upcoming exchange that is fully regulated and have some educational tools, you can try this [one](

Oh yes, Crytocurrency as a whole here in our country is still not very known for there are too many poor people to give a thing about it. I would love to educate some people in bitcoin even though I’m a new in this kind of trade. When this upcoming [exchange]( becomes live, I will use its educational tool to teach some that are interested.

I won’t disagree with you man but yellow and violet combination is very royalty in style. I’m finding a good upcoming [exchange]( right now and I found this one called Bitrus that have an educational tool and it’s fully regulated.

Yes, teaching math at the age of 14 at a local academy, owns $530 worth of bitcoin that may become hundreds of thousands someday. When I’m at that age I don’t know a thing about life and just enjoying high school. Now, I own some of the crypto’s too and one of it is bitcoin and I use it to play some games [here]( and I’m enjoying it for I am winning a lot of coins.

Yes, I know that, my point is how people can buy bitcoin if their fiat money is very low and on the brink of extinction? Venezuela should start using USD for them to have a money that has worth and be able to buy bitcoin. If ever those in need of an upcoming exchange that is fair to its traders, I recommend you this one called [Bitrus](

It would be better if it’s just a single bitcoin symbol in the middle.
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:10:23
Nope, they can’t do it, the value of USD will decline like what happened to Germany after the world war, where they print so much money but unsuccessful from implementing it. In my opinion, fiat and crypto can coexist so why the hate right? I personally want use this platform called [Bitrus]( because of their signup incentives and regulations.

Oh man, that’s a very good one! But why buy 2 motorcycles? Just kidding. Those people that adopt early are very lucky if they didn’t sell their BTC. In the future, I will use this platform called [Bitrus]( because it’s a very good, it’s unique and their sign up incentive is superb.

Here in our country you won’t get charge a single centavo when withdrawing your own money in the ATM that banks provided for you, and it’s actually all around here so you’ll have no worries. But what’s true is the pin thing because keymapping is a thing and some ATM is not always regulated because few people in that area use them. I’m finding a upcoming good [exchange]( that has an educational platform because I’m kinda new to crypto and I want to learn fast as I could.
@_date: 2019-03-21 03:20:12
That is some good  way to earn man!

Yes but his mentality can work on a retail business where you can higher the price for that 8 pizza than selling the whole one as a wholesale. I remember playing a [game]( where I bet slowly but surely and didn’t bet it all. And in the end I earn more than losing in the first.

More than a thousand times in just less than a year..

If you’re low on btc I think you should buy now because bullish time is near I think. Bitcoin is really on a good track right now considering we just hit 4K last 2 weeks ago if I remember correctly. I use my btc to play this [game]( and so far I’m winning games and it’s so fun!
@_date: 2019-04-18 12:01:12
Nice art buddy, it reminds me of some fallout style. I love this particular art because it’s just so simple, it’s just like hand brushed. You got a good tip about bitcoin out there. Btw, I’m trading at coinbase and here at [Bittreo]( because it have a good OTC discounts that is up to 20%!
@_date: 2019-04-15 11:44:49
Simply because most people are afraid to lose all the hard earned money they have right now. So they will just use it on whatever they like or just simply put it in the bank. But for me I’ll take the risk if I only have a lot of spare money right now. I’m currently using Coinbase and [Bittreo]( just recently because of their high referral commission of 30% which me and my friends enjoy.

Oh, is that so? That’s why they don’t care about those fake imitations selling in Hong Kong and other countries. I hate a direct copy of a product, but that shirt of OP is cool and I want one for myself too. I’m playing this crypto casino [game]( when I saw this post and it’s actually good.
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:11:19
Good phone man nice user interface!
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:37:56
Good shirt man, but what Nike stand to this?
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:53:08
Thanks for this fella. A really cool icons and i love the design. Would love to use this for icons on my android phone.
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:58:16
Yes, considering how fast the surge is. 4K last month then 5k. Maybe 6k next few weeks. I’m lucky here in my [game]( a crypto casino, because I won btc yesterday in this time that bitcoin is getting better.
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:04:48
This is so cool man! Hope you got dog art, though. I will keep hodling for now until it reaches my personal moon or before it goes down to my buying point which is $4000. I’m using this [exchange]( called Bittreo because they have 20% discounts on otc trades.
@_date: 2019-04-01 09:09:36
Yep it’s the same. This post is satire. But it’s an eye opening post because we will not have more than 21 Million bitcoin and it’s shocking because so far the number already reached 17.5 million and the whole world doesn’t adapt yet. Some bitcoin investors gamble with their btc here in [Vegas casino]( because it’s a good site to have fun and a chance to win more bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:27:59
In my opinion, you should only invest what you can afford to lose because when any of these cryptocurrency that you invest with falls, you will not fall with it for you have save most of your money. But I also understand what other people do, specially the maximalist. They invest like there’s no tomorrow and some of them blame bitcoin when it’s falls. For me, I spend some of coins in [gaming]( and it’s a good experience.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:02:30
It is very possible that bitcoin will become parabolic again when you bought at the right time, before it reach $4,000. There’s also a chance of massive fluctuation in the next months, but I doubt it will go down at $4k again. At best, we should all hodl for our coins and just spend what we can afford to lose. For me, I spend my spare coins at some [games]( where there’s a chance of winning big and also not getting scammed.
