The whole point of bitcoin is that everyone has the entire transaction records of everyone else, keeping that anonymous is basically impossible unless you have extreme opsec. So a bank screwed up it's data destruction pipeline and basically lost a receipt ... what's the big deal? Seems like an employee just screwed up destroying a tape, this doesn't seem like a big data loss scandal.
Anyone who is clever enough can tie your identity to your bitcoin transaction history.

What's your point?

I use Sabayon which provides nice compiled versions to install from binaries for a large portion of the portage tree plus the ability to compile anything in the portage tree to my heart's content and have it work nicely with the package manager.

I was told once by a friend doing something at a Vegas show that it cost as much to overnight a crate of their stuff across the country as it did to have it moved it from the loading dock to the conference room.

What they're probably doing is replacing their code and servers which do the transaction arbitration with a bitcoin-like system entirely in house.  Maintaining stock 'wallets' on nasdaq servers for each customer - making the change mostly invisible to end users.
Maybe they have one big blockchain for all of the stocks covered, maybe one blockchain per stock.
They would obviously build in mechanisms to reverse transactions (theft or losing keys shouldn't be an issue) and it's doubtful they're having clients keep track of private keys.
The important bit is them using a blockchain for their transaction logs and probably also to arbitrate the actual trades.

You know what's dystopic?  Corporations using anonymous untraceable money to make payments between one another.
You _want_ corporations to do their business with banks, for them to have recorded transactions that can be audited, for them to be accessible to laws through the banking system.
Corporations also _want_ a third party facilitating financial transactions and fixing errors, fraud, and crime.
Wild west type shit with companies exchanging the modern equivalent of duffel bags full of cash is how you get a dystopic corporate owned future.
JP Morgan's coin isn't about consumer money, it's about making business-to-business transactions a little better.
In the west you should be more afraid of corporate power over you than government power, and giving corporations anonymous free-from-regulation money gives them more power, not you.

Everyone should know that these things happen with PayPal sometimes – their business is very explicitly dispute arbitrage, and in order to maximize their own profit (in combination with often bad customer service) they do this sort of thing.
At some point it's your own fault for not being aware that this is a risk.

Receiving stolen property is still a crime.

The actual anonymity of bitcoin is overstated. Every transaction can be followed (and eventually will connect with a person or institution in the real world) and exchanges could easily poison and refuse to exchange any coins which trace back to the ransom transaction.

Just think critically for a moment and wonder if it were possible to turn 1 btc into 100,000 so trivially why would anyone ever use bitcoin.

Bitcoin is only mildly anonymous and the blockchain is obviously public. If there is someone to track down a wallet ID gets you a long way.

The volume of BTC trades is nowhere near high enough that a single investor can't have drastic effects on the price.  There is also such a small usability of BTC tying it to actual value that there is little pressure besides speculated value driving price.

I would rather EFF spend its resources on its current issues; BTC may have an interesting future but it is not of vital importance.

Eh I caught a piece of something @ 39.8; portfolio value up 15% for the day; I'm happy.
And I didn't do it with magic, it was a limit order, sold out high a couple of days ago and had a low-ball limit order just in case of some big volitility.
