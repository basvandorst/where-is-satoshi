Very clean integration - did breadwallet create an app call that other apps can use to ask for your Bitcoin address? It's sweet.

Yea just because it exists does not mean you can't build it and make it even better. Good luck!

I listed it on  - Streamium TV Guide that handles time zones and hides old posts.

Once you have your link, make sure you add it to the  Streamium schedule - we've made a rolling "TV Guide" that handles time zones and hides your link once it ends. Not too many Streamium feeds yet so looking forward to watching!

Hey - we run a real time Streamium directory at  which shows scheduled streams adjusted for your time zone. We also aggregate any streams we find elsewhere not posted by our users.
We've seen 1-4 streams per day consistently, but hasn't taken off yet, as Streamium Devs are still rolling out great new features. It's still beta but it's getting more amazing every day especially since it's a free, open source project.

Added to  's instant Bitcoin services! Any more like this we can add?
Edit: Link fixed.

I was thinking the same thing today! So I whipped up 
Does anybody have any streamium links we can test?
I also added a few services that take advantage of Bitcoin and don't need accounts etc. Any others I can add?

Nice! And welcome to the scene! Http://Coiniko.com is doing something similar but focused on scheduled streams - so we just show streams that are happening now or in the next 48 hours.
We built a rolling real time homepage and instant submission system and are also looking for streams!
We should work on some APIs so both our sites can see pull each other's streams so we all have everything, and each offer our own unique "view".

I've setup Coiniko.com which is a rolling real time catalogue of Streamium feeds submitted by people. Keep an eye on it for current feeds!
@_date: 2015-05-26 12:53:17
Pssttt - your link is actually  (use the join link to get other people to join your stream!)
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:30:49
I'll send a few transactions then!

Hey - Android or iPhone?
Try the Chrome Browser on both - happy to test with you.

Oops, didn't like my possessive apostrophe! Fixed.

Great idea! Make sure you schedule your streams on  to get the most viewers

Hey - added to our live stream guide at  When is this live stream ending?
