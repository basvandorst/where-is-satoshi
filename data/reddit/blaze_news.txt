I was just thinking how fortunate we are that someone took the time to write out in full detail how the price is moving, because my ability to read one single number and come to the same conclusion is obviously nonexistent.

Crypto is the wild west, amigo. No such laws exist.

Yes, that's why I said "that doesn't really make sense" because to use those terms outside of margin trading doesn't quite fit the intended use. "going long" is a bit more common to express your confidence in an asset and therefore that you're investing in it, but again, the person was clearly talking about margin trading.
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:49:09
Other than on margin, "going long" on crypto would just mean investing in it. Then "shorting" crypto would be selling your crypto anticipating it to drop. However that doesn't exactly make sense and generally if you use the terms long/short you're referring to margin trading, and judging from how the other user spoke about what they wanted to do, I'm sure they're talking about margin trading.
How do you trade without exchanges? If by trade you only mean buying and selling in a basic sense, you could do peer-to-peer trades locally, depending on what the presence is in your area.  serves as an escrow basically to make trades locally, if you are genuinely interested in trading without an exchange. 
A third option are bitcoin ATMs which exist to varying degrees around the world which aren't actively dependent on an exchange (although I would imagine the operator would use an exchange to do bulk buying/selling).

We're talking about crypto hence why I'm tailoring my explanation and description to the crypto space. I'm not in any way implying you could day or swing trade on localbitcoins or an ATM, which is why I said "If by trade you only mean buying and selling in a basic sense". 
Maybe read the context of my post before you try to counter the things I said?
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:14:23
They're poorly trying to describe trading on margin with their coins and entering a "long position" - buying more bitcoin than they hold by borrowing from the exchange with their coins as collateral.

How much paper money do you hold outside of a bank?
I’m willing to bet it’s not enough to last the weekend. “Paper money” is a dying concept.

The Fed are loaning out funds literally overnight to ease a shortage of liquidity; generally speaking banks will exchange funds overnight as some banks will have taken in excess cash and others in need of cash; due to unfortunate timing it looks like the banks themselves weren't able to cover the cash requirements and the fed stepped in as a lender of last resort. This headline is being spun in a pretty alarmist way - if the lending continues for days/weeks then it would be indicative of some underlying systemic stress/failure but currently I don't believe it's as terrifying as people are acting. The loans are collateralized anyway so it's not like this is just magical money being dumped into the economy.

To be fair I day trade coins and short/long as the market moves. It's possible to do, it just has to be done carefully. Doesn't sound like dude in the post thought very hard about the position he was entering.

Here's how I know you're losing this argument: your blatant hostility and hahahahaha's. You should be able to make your point without feeling some need to tell the other guy how wrong and stupid they are, otherwise you just look immature and unconfident.
