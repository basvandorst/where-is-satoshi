I understood that perfectly thanks! I was watching TRX yesterday and didnt lock in my gains since I thought it would keep rising. I didnt put a stop loss on it because I read that a big investor could dump their shares triggering other people's stop losses and "kicking me out" of the game. Honestly this is all new to me and I will be making some newbie mistakes. I wish I did work for someone who would show me all the tricks. I just dont have the background to just apply for a trading firm position

Thanks for the advice. I was thinking about your scenario and let us say you reset your stop loss after your trade went up. On one hand you lock in the gains but on the other, if the trade dips below your stop loss momentarily and then goes up again, you are now out of the game. 


What do you mean by that? like if 1 bitcoin goes up 20%, I should use 0.5 of that BTC to buy BCH?

It was either that dude or the entire silk road operation. If you want to cherry pick, the entire silk road operation saved thousands of lives. The guy who had the hit out on him was working for the silk road until he had no choice but to cooperate in it's destruction, thus putting thousands of innocent lives in danger.

His cause is worthy and did help a lot of people

Yes, this is what my whole argument hinges on. The drug policies are draconian and unjust. Ross' biggest crime was creating a tool to allow people to circumvent these drug policies to freely trade narcotics. Was it illegal? yes. Was it immoral? no. Thousands of people die every year in the US due to drug violence. Specifically due to organized gang violence that is connected to the drug trade. Drug trade doesn't have to be so deadly if the consumer is linked directly to the producer, avoiding the violent middleman. The drugs were delivered from Mexico to Australia? Good. Whoever needed drugs got them without involving a vast criminal enterprise that kills, kidnaps, and tortures people along the way. 
Did he procure or deliver any drugs himself? No. Did he even touch any of the drugs? no. What the Feds are so butthurt about is the fact that drugs delivered via the silk road cannot be intercepted and the drug money cannot be seized like it can be when traditional routes are available. You can't seize bitcoin and you can only intercept mail which isn't attached to any individual while in transit. It was a brilliant idea. The only way to stop this was to nail the facilitator: Ross. 
Did he put hits out on people? maybe, but whoever he may have killed prevented thousands of deaths related to organized drug trafficking crime. If the war on drugs was really about preventing suffering, Ross would be at the bottom of the list of the DEA priorities. Instead, he ended up being a martyr for a good cause.

If you saw the documetary, he knew what risk he was putting himself in. He wasn't dumb and he knew people would be looking for him. But he did it because he believed is something bigger than himself and was willing to put his freedom at risk to make it happen. It wasn't about money for him and it was only criminal because the laws are criminal

Wait, you said you read the indictment and the news and all your sources didn't tell you that there wasn't enough evidence to convict him of attempted murder and the charges were dismissed? 
The charges were: 
* Criminal enterprise and drug trafficking: Okay, criminal in a sense that it facilitates free drug trade. A violation of an unfair law
*  Money laundering: Yes, when you obtain money through drugs, they must be laundered. Kind of redundant, if you ask me. 
* Computer hacking: Okay sure. 
He is not serving a life sentence because he tried to kill someone. If anything, it was the prosecution who tried to put a tint on Ross, painting him as some kind of a mafia don because if they simply charged him with drug trafficking, the public and the jury won't care. 
Lastly, he didn't traffic drugs, he facilitates a free and anonymous drug exchange. That's it. No guns, nothing else that harms people. 
It was actually the rogue secret service agents who first stole his money, then pretended to be asassins to bait him into committing a crime the public cares about. And even in that they failed. Seriously, just read the news:

There is a documentary about it, you should watch it.  See for yourself.

This is completely expected. Crypto is a great way to convert currencies without arousing suspicion. Prior to this, the scheme involved mirror trades through DB and US put an end to this. [Great article about how bitcoin could be used for the same purpose]( (For people who like long stories)

I read the indictment AND watched the documentary. I keep an open mind and view both sources with suspicion. If you are happy to believe one side and it makes your life easier, more power to ya

Sounds like an argument to NOT have a patient record. If there is no record, no one knows but you...
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:33:42
Serious question: How important is patient data, really? Do you have any allergies? Can you remember your last TB shot date? Are you on medication? 
You fill that form out every time you go to the hospital. What's the big deal?

Hey leave HSBC alone! They are just regular old joes like you and I trying to make an honest living
