QE almost explicitly gets used for buying bad debt instruments. Gold doesn't go up because it's hard money. Same for bitcoin. 
Will demand for hard money be offset by less access to money? Who knows

Considering 1.4 trillion was allocated for next year's budget on defense and 1.3 on everything else it especially feels like theft considering we police the world with it unjustly....
We have no say in how things are spent. judging by the budget the military industrial complex does though.

I think the future is way too bright to easily dismiss Bitcoins future.
Quantum disruption would be just that. A disruption. SHA 256 won't last forever, but so what. A new algo will happen eventually.
If you're discussing sustainability from a power perspective it's basically a flawed debate. The way power consumption works mining is effectively a subsidy for carbon neutral production.

I hope you can understand why it's a sore subject. Banks can have the best customer support but at the end of the day they're shoveling free and easy money. Most bitcoin supporters subscribe to somewhat Austrian school of thought as compared to the kanzian principles prescribed today.

This is amazing. 
I love Peter Schiff. He was honestly one of the first people to open my eyes about the con job that is central banking.
That being said he should understand Bitcoin. I genuinely believe his company shares prevent him from being honest about crypto. I think he sees it as a threat and won't treat it honestly.
I own both gold and bitcoin. Both will always be better money than Fiat.

There is a way to run a self directed ira. Depending on your amount it may be worth pursuing that to curtail some of the fees.
A lot of IRAs are built on debt that has questionable longevity. If you are planning to monetize this sooner than 5-10 years you're probably ok. If longer it may be worth the hit anyways. 
This is not financial advice. A financial advisor would advise strongly against my suggestions so take what I say with a grain of salt. 
However, if you can source your satoshi's from multiple streams I would do that anyways.
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:53:34

Again it's architecture built on top of a system that's broken. You won't find love defending it here.
Borrowing money to service small accounts does not pay. Borrowing tons of money to speculate and then getting bailed out does.
At the end of the day though they're pulling money from a source that makes it a line item to come into existence. Money shouldn't be soft it should be hard.
Japan Central Bank balance sheet just surpassed its annual GDP. Tell me there isn't anything wrong with that.

As a professional miner myself there are several hurdles you must cross.
If you want to do at scale generally you must qualify for industrial consumption. If you don't have the capital to scale to this that's ok but you won't be competitive (which will really hurt in down markets).
If your time preference on money is less than two years, do not mine (and probably don't be in crypto as a whole). 
And finally the knowledge gap is probably 2 years. If you can afford to pay for mistakes great! If not, get actual help from a veteran and heed their advice.
Hope this helps.

You seem to be resistant to the concept of this being harder to achieve than your portraying. It's worked for 10 years and there's been billions at stake.

You cannot have a zero Satoshi transaction. It will be invalidated by nodes. Therefore unless there is an extensively large mem pool a 1 Satoshi per byte transaction will eventually go through.
I do this a lot actually. If I know I don't need an immediate settlement I'll pay a couple cents a transaction and it'll get through in a few days or a few hours.

It constantly blows my mind that in all of these discussions miners abiding by time of use, therefore not adding load, therefore utilizing waste, therefore reducing overall cost for everyone else, is never discussed! How you utilize energy is everything in terms of your impact. Miners are most capable of TOU schedule. Yet the conversation is always "herp derp that's a lot of power"

You should mine with a GPU rig for the sake off understanding how things work first hand. Know that it's more or less a process of understanding and not a viable business model. The unfortunate truth is that mining as an industry is super large scale, slim margin, and hyper competitive. IMHO it's one of the hardest industries to compete in.

I did. What you failed to realize is that 1% of transactions even being on Bitcoin is a far stretch. How un self aware are you that you cannot recognize the irony of your own statement.

Except for the fact that the reward for security has grown exponentially while coin yield has decreased. The amount of security behind this network right now is genuinely absurd.
The fact that security becomes proportional to network value is a reassuring thing in my mind not a discouraging thing. And it also has a tapering mechanism to where it won't consume the whole earth if the earth denominates it as it's primary currency.

Learn this the hard way with my family too. You cannot help someone who does not want to help themselves. There's almost nothing you can say about  Bitcoin to convince people it's a good idea. Mainly because there are no easy comparisons. Which is exactly why it makes us sound crazy talking about it.
Part of my DCA strategy though is to set aside some for family when they do realize and show genuine interest.

You're listing the inflation rate/mining reward not accounting for the actual cost attack of said system, how to achieve the attack, and specifically labeling what the attack would do.

I literally just got done explaining its deflationary nature. 
If you had any idea how much compute secures the network now you would know that it could taper off and be just fine. 
Honestly man I think you're a moron. It's not just miners protecting the system. I really think people who see this as an all or nothing scenario genuinely do not get how this thing works.

So half the network of miners shut off. I don't understand how it's a terrible situation to be honest with you. Litecoin lost 3/4 of its network hash power and it still hasn't been attacked. Quelling the growth of network hash is not necessarily awful. We've far past what is feasibly necessary to secure it I believe.

@_date: 2019-12-17 06:05:09
In all fairness I have somewhat enjoyed your stubborn fixation on this narrow scope of an implausible attack vector. Your thesis states that we are at the whims of the Chinese government whenever they want to pull the trigger. My thesis is that they can't do s***. If they wanted to attack Bitcoin they ought to leverage the tools that they hold close and impose stopgaps on Fiat on ramps (or pick a dozen other things that are within grasp, not limited to supplying a palatable alternative to Fiat). So we are definitely polarizing in our views. 
I also genuinely believe it would be poor strategy for the Chinese government to attack hard money as a concept. They have been accumulating gold since the 70s. I think they're expanding credit as much as they can until they have to transition back to a hard money policy, to which they are better prepared than the US is.  
Also, your comment about the protocol following the heaviest chain does not apply to people. people will follow whatever protocol suits them best.
Also also, there are so many bugs in the Bitcoin protocol it's laughable. Having to build around bugs that have been around forever is part of its charm. Hell there was a bug once that allowed someone to create some billion Bitcoin. Did that kill our network? Or was concesus reached quickly proving that this is a tool that serves the will of many and not the whim of a few?
Anyways thank you for your time.

Again you're looking at this one-dimensionally. I genuinely wholeheartedly hope someone tries to attack the Bitcoin network. If that's its flaw, truly, then let it be known. 
Until then I'm very convinced that this theoretical back of the napkin calculation does not address reality.
You remember that time a bug was found and a crapload of Bitcoin we're created? There was a chain split and a consensus to move to that quickly. A bad actor cannot control a network like Bitcoin, especially when he is known.
Just finished reading the article too. It was so one-sided it was laughable. Almost every critique he has I have a counter critique. There was literally nothing of substance. Just game theory that falls short of reality.
@_date: 2019-12-14 00:41:33
Yes and then what happens to inflation in 5 months, then in 4 years, then in four more years? How do you currently measure Fiat inflation? Because we all know it's b*******.

@_date: 2019-12-16 07:44:48
Well first of all I know the mining industry very very well. A lot of big miners in China bribe officials to fly under the radar. It's a decent mechanism for capital flight as well. So you're talking about the Chinese government rounding up people that aren't even on radar. So your assumption is that the government rounds up literally everyone and then the rest of the world just throws their hands up and doesn't fight an attack which would be very publicized if every Chinese miner was forced to do something.
So what if miners collude? Congratulations you've got Bitcoin cash 2.0. Who cares. If the world wants to call a double spend chain the main chain then I guess that's our own fault. There's a global consensus element that can never be overstated. Run a node. Vote on BIPs. Do your part if you really want to protect what you value as Bitcoin.
Also you're calculating the cost of a mansion for the daily OPEX assuming 100% efficiency. Does CAPEX mean nothing to you? You're not calculating how much transformation has to exist. It took two years to build my 50 megawatt transformer (nevermind the tens of millions spent) and you're talking about assembling gigawatt hours. Do you even realize how insane that is to say? How much cable diversion has to exist?  How would you even congregate that much power density in a controlled environment without affecting existing grid operations? You're simplistic calculation doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how you would achieve this attack..
Now the even more pathetic thing is the actual attack itself could be completely subverted if a network majority decided to revert the network prior to a reorg. I imagine this is what would happen in the event of a sha 256 collision with the break of the Satoshi wallet for example. You think all the other actors are just going to sit around and do nothing? Your thought that everyone just rolls over against miners demonstrates that you do not understand how little power miners actually have. It's a very interestingly balanced system. 
And the even crazier part is you didn't really articulate what they attack actually was trying to achieve other than network dominance. So you double spend one block. You have to maintain that network position for a very long time to even achieve that, which is improbable at best even with a majority.
Just because you can string a math equation on issuance doesn't mean you can look at this picture as a whole.
I'll say it again. Do the attack. Prove that I'm an idiot.
Also final thing I'll say on this topic. The spirit of Bitcoin is not a fixed matter. If some government or someone figures out how to break the system that only teaches us how to build a better system. I still don't think anyone can pull that off but it would be fun to see what we come up with if they did.
@_date: 2019-12-26 03:16:04
So make it a public service. This is the community center open forum of our generation. Now that governments can do their bidding behind the mask of private companies (god bless the patriot act) this is a serious attack of freedom of speech. One degree of separation does not make it right.
@_date: 2019-12-15 04:39:52
I think you should go liquidate your mansion and produce enough chips to attack this network as well as coordinate all the energy required to do that. 
Or you could just buy out half the network tokens of a POS chain and attack that in the same day.
Your math doesn't account for reality sir.

Also you are stating that the protocol itself in Bitcoin is central despite it being flat and open? Does that mean any set of rules is a centralized theory? What about the fact that anyone can write a bip to change the rules?
If this is your thesis then I'm going to get to work on anarchy dollars.

@_date: 2019-12-16 00:28:59
You say no one's had incentive to attack the network but I think you're forgetting what bitcoin is. I still am curious as to why you haven't done it. It sounds like you get off to the thought of it, I can't imagine how much fun it would be for you to do it yourself. Shut me up. Prove me wrong. Go attack it.
My guess is that you're all in on debt. This 50-year experiment of money without backing doesn't end well. US dollar is the best room on the Titanic. Meanwhile we're arguing about theoretical points that have zero basis in reality.

Thank you for the response. So my synopsis is that all forms of govern whether monetary or not stem from a central point of reference. I can agree to that and any society has rules written or not.
Is it then fair to state that historically that central point required trust, and now any individual can independently verify thus a paradigm shift in trust as a whole?
