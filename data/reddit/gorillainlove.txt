Right...and what the fuck does this have to do about the uselessness of Ethereum?
Oh yeah, absolutely nothing. You're just changing the subject because you realise yourself that if you probe even slightly into your line of reasoning about what exactly a "smart contract" is useful for you come up with nada.
Hopefully you have the open-mindedness to learn once from others in a while :)
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:43:57
Why? This just sounds like superstition
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:56:12
Thanks! That's amazing, open-mindedness is a virtue.
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:32:19
Moves or no moves it's all about the technology right ��
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:48:21
I just want to add to the narrative and perhaps logic.
Imo alt coins are dragging Bitcoin down. The massive sell off of shitcoins is causing a lot of weak hands to cash out of the crypto market completely.
It’s time for Bitcoin to unpair from the shitcoins ironically like they were asking for in the 2017 bull market.
Only in this case it’s because they are dragging us down rather than the other way around.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:24:56
The problem of having too much money yeah...
@_date: 2019-07-26 05:31:02
I don't even think about you ;)
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:38:20
Everyone buy Bitcoin, every hodler adds an exponential effect to the price ;)
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:00:20
“Smart contracts”, “dapps”, “protocols”, keep saying those things over and over and over again and maybe one day they will actually mean something.
What do you actually need a “smart contract” for?
Nobody really needs any of that shit. Ethereum is a shitcoin through and through.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:20:48
Just means more cheap Bitcoin ;) and there's only 21m to go around!
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:39:35
Cryptokitties is your use case?
Jesus Christ, you shitcoiners and your delusion.
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:10:03
Bitcoin = Digital Gold + Digital Silver + Web 3.0
Litecoin = shitcoin
Ethereum = shitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:19:55
Bank transfers are so fucking slow. How is it 2019 and it still takes 1-2 business days to transfer between bank accounts?
It's pissing me off, making me miss a good part of this rally. Bitcoin would have done a million confirmations in the same period of time.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:43:55
20k feels so close at these levels
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:10:43
Why the fuck do you need gaming assets on a Blockchain?
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:55:51
It's nothing to do with 'good' or 'evil'. It's just what will eventually happen because Bitcoin is the scarcest asset and the best store of value known to mankind.
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:45:37
Truly crazy to think there is a chance we never see Bitcoin below 10k USD ever again, fingers crossed!
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:12:41
I dunno about you guys but I'm fucking bullish about Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:08:59
If it were that easy...
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:52:22
Plan B only published his article in March. I think that's the difference between at $1 and now.
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:52:31
No way u/GrapeJelly are you satoshi?!
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:18:15
What do you gain for selling for fiat? More fiat?
Why do you want more fiat?
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:24:55
Doing anything is a gamble. Bitcoin is just a particularly good one.
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:59:31
I like it when the price goes up
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:35:06
Oh boy
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:38:04
Are you not financially entertained?!
@_date: 2019-08-08 08:54:09
Have a feeling this narrowing range is going to spring us to $15k over the next few days.
Fingers crossed for fireworks this weekend.
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:18:02
One of these times will be the last time we ever see 12k again and on towards $1 million per BTC
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:10:03
Ok let's give some spurious analogy when I can't think of another use case besides crypto kitties. 
That'll really show the strength and utility of my shitcoin!!
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:20:00
Man you're so wrong on almost every time scale it's not even funny.
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:44:54
So many traders expecting a retrace but forget that we've already been to $13k and had our 35% retrace. 
I suspect we haven't seen the parabolic move of this uptrend yet which will bring us to $20k as the next stop before our next significant retrace.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:30:01
To think our market cap is still only $200B. So undervalued it's crazy..
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:15:43
With shitcoins yes but not with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:30:52
Then you don't understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:14:32
Never sell, it's stupid tbh
@_date: 2019-08-29 09:33:16
You don't need 100% of the world to believe in stock to flow for Plan B's article to have an effect.
It's certainly had an effect on my buying, and I'm sure on many others.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:45:42
Great comment btw, I've never thought about it from this perspective.
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:33:31
11k tonight?
@_date: 2019-08-25 10:54:04
Bitcoin isn't some social networking app. It will be nice to have fancy UI/UX but it's PRIMARY use case as a decentralised store of value is enough for it to be globally adopted and become worth trillions.
It doesn't matter if your friends/teacher/grandma don't get it cause it's too difficult to use.
@_date: 2019-10-10 10:21:40
Invest in yourself, increase the value you provide to the world and your earning capacity.
Stack more sats each month.
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:45:37
This is going to be a fun weekend.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:14:03
The thing is though even if it's current fair value is 8.7k, why would you not front-run if you know about stock to flow and know that the fair value will be 60k after the next halving?
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:37:16
Shitcoin is the basis for a lot of other interesting shitcoins such as shitcoin etc. isn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:10:03
Stop trying to trade. You're not a professional trader. Just make a decision to buy and hold right now and take control of your emotions through the price swings. You'll thank yourself in a few years.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:20:39
So you flipped heads a few times in a row. Can you keep doing it?
@_date: 2019-10-10 13:24:46
Not so sure about that.
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:42:39
I'll go against the grain and say just do it. If my comment convinces you, you may end up coming back and thanking me in 5 years.
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:30:14
You may have done - but can you do it again?
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:41:59
Damn thanks for saying what I've been thinking about a lot recently so eloquently.
@_date: 2019-12-14 07:10:03
So why are you anonymous and possibly a unicorn?
See how easy it is to spread baseless FUD?
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:18:40

What is the meaning of life?
@_date: 2019-12-01 12:37:05
Those are not scarce.
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:07:47
Oxygen is useful and it's free. Scarcity determines value not usefulness.
Are you slow?
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:30:14
This price action is so bullish
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:22:34
Stupid reasoning. You buy things even with a deflationary currency because you need to if you want to live.
You just don't end up buying useless things like you do with inflationary fiat. Stop spouting Keynesian nonsense.

Transactions are so cheap atm
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:00:48
I would front-run that event and buy it for cheaper hehe
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:29:35
What kind of macroeconomics? Keynesian?
If you meant that then you may say you're not anti-Bitcoin but you sure as fuck don't understand it still.
@_date: 2019-09-15 00:06:17
Umm bitcoin 10k never again?
Sorry I jinxed it again
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:24:43
Why are there so many fiat shills and trolls trying to dilute the Bitcoin message like you nowadays?
Either educate yourself or buy some Bitcoin already.
@_date: 2019-09-15 17:25:51
Anything below 10.3k is starting to look really cheap
