You absolutely do lose, since they cost you money to buy or mine in the first place.
If you *never* sell then you may as well have lost them.

Depends how much tax you don't pay.

....aaaand this is the other problem with r/bitcoin: I can't tell if you're trolling.

Actually, it does. It provides liquidity to the entire economy.
I can transfer money to my staff or suppliers nearly instantly for free.
BTC transactions cost *far* too much for it to be considered a usable currency and the[electricity costs]( are insane already.

Always? TF's the point then?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:51


That is precisely what it is.
Be worried.

It didn't really. You can downvote or report a post if you feel it necessary though.

So even after all btc have been mined, will the difficulty continue to rise?
It sounds like this will lead to some event in a hundred or so years where the fees suddenly skyrocket or the transactions become unbearably slow.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:43:01
Do you mean that the difficulty will then decrease as people pull out as we approach 21M?
I.e. will we theoretically reach a point where there are no "miners" any more, so there are only a few (centralised?!) servers online to process transactions, but they can actually do it quicker than now because the lack of "competition" will actually make that work easier then than it is now?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:37:20
Will the fees drop though? At the moment we have huge networks of distributed processing power required to run full pelt to get anywhere. If the last coin was mined right now, that network would still be required to process the next transaction.
I guess where I'm coming from is a feeling that the momentum of that network would continue. I.e. the mega coin mining operation that is currently having its costs offset by mining BTC would still have the same costs, so the fees would have to skyrocket to keep them earning the same amount OR a lot of people would simply switch off because it isn't profitable and transaction times would skyrocket instead.
This seems right. Please explain why it isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:17:35
I mean more what happens to fees/transaction speed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:55:48
I'd guess that takes account for projected advances in processing/hashing power?
What happens if we suddenly have some breakthrough in quantum computing that lets us do all of those calculations in an unexpectedly short time?
Even if we don't, the question stands: What's the future of btc in the 2200's?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:33:20
Because if it happened the other way round it would have gone as you had hoped/expected and therefore you would not feel the need to post about it as strongly.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:48:28
That's correct.


That has a misstep in logic. 
i.e. I'm a real person. My name is not actually I_Bin_Painting.  The only evidence *you* have of *me* is my Reddit account. If somebody else hacked my account it obviously wouldn't make them me, it would just mean that it would then be almost impossible for you to verify if the person using the I_Bin_Painting account was me, the original hacker or someone else entirely.
It obfuscates, it does not prove anything.

That's what I said, and pretty much the opposite of what you stated though. You said that the identity is irrelevant and that whoever has the key *is* Satoshi.
This is not to say that there aren't other ways of identifying Satoshi. The person that can demonstrate full control of the original bitcoin would be enough to convince me.
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:59:53
That's pretty wishy-washy bullshit, mate.
I don't know why you feel it is irrelevant who Satoshi is, especially in the context of some guy claiming to be him, but your claim that "Whoever has [Satoshi's private key], thus, has to be Satoshi" is patently absurd.
