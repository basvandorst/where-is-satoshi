I don't know myself but futures in crypto should be illegal.  This market is still small relatively speaking and very easy to manipulate if you have enough play money.
I know it will bounce back but many of the new people recently in the market are way too burned and will never touch this again.

Phishing link from Google search.  It was the first result in the search that has  "ad"  at the end.  The link looks genuine but it's fake with redirecting to look alike site.  They got his username, password, and 2FA info and you control of the account.  I blame Google for allowing this crap to happen.

Looks like it's 4pm eastern.  This is what the website shows which I believe answers the question.

I just googled it myself and it shows an "Ad" with the .com address..... but I am not going to click it in fear of it being a nasty page.  I don't think binance even buys ads on Google and I think it even warned me about this when I registered, but that could have been Trezor digital wallet setup that I am recalling?  
I always check to see if the page is secure before logging in.  Sorry man but hard lesson learned.  =o(

Actually I believe it expires tomorrow, the 17th.

My guess is you went to phishing site somehow.  Did you just type the address in or did you google the exact address?

Sounds like your 2FA wasn't enabled.  I just don't understand why accounts don't require it on by default?

Couldn't hacker from a phishing site log in with credentials/2FA, then change the email from victim to themselves?  They got 2 sets of 2FA so could have used the second one for withdrawal and they get the email themselves?  They could also change the 2FA while they logged in the first time?

What happens if your phone is hacked though?  At that time the hacker can get the 2FA info?  Is it advised not to use the same phone for logging into the exchange that has the 2FA info?

Going out on a limb but thinking you were on a phishing site.  The first time you entered the 2FA they used that to log in on the real binance website.... then the second time you typed it in is the code they used to withdraw?
