Nothing to read here. Bitcoin is unstoppable. Let the control freaks hold a million hearings about it. Won't matter. You can't touch this, bitches.
Next up: Replacing government. We're already working on the old guard of finance. Some humans are ready to leave the old concept of money and government behind for good. I can't wait.

Why do people care what those clowns in Washington think? We need to focus on building out Bitcoin and alternatives to corrupt government and central banks. We do not need their approval to thrive. We need systems that will eventually replace them. Bitcoin is one such thing.

Life will never perfect, but ...
1. I want to live in a society as an INDIVIDUAL. I'm sick of Americans labeling me as something I don't embrace because of my appearance. I loathe the existence of race as a social construct. It impacts every facet of life and it has no biological relevance.
2. Central banks have created trillions out of thin air while millions have died over this funny money. Society won't bother with asking simple questions like, "Where did the Federal Reserve get $16 trillion to loan temporarily to global banks?" If I can't pull a trillion from my ass on the spot, neither should a central bank.
3. Politics in America. Same bullshit each cycle. We praise and worship people we don't know because of what's read and seen. Or because we're a diehard republican or democrat. Thanks to both sides of the aisle and the people's lack of due diligence on a broad scale, our country is facing a $17 trillion national debt with 100 million unemployed. Completely absurd and unacceptable.
4. God is just another lie, but it doesn't stop billions from praying to the sky. There are so many atrocities that God could prevent. And how about those who SWEAR on the Bible before entering office? Just a big fucking sham.
Life is like a book of fiction. Sadly, it can't be closed because what man has written for us is too real. I'm sick of fighting back against the nonsense. This world could be better if more demanded it better of each other and the worthless politicians we expect to tell us how to live, think, act and shit.

This article should hit home for those who proclaim that a financed car or home is "theirs" -- it certainly isn't and government is definitely upset about Bitcoin because of the freedom and ownership it affords all without the blessing of our masters.
The new slave master is indeed government and until the masses ignore "massa", his laws and threats will continue to reign.

They ought to be investigating the Federal Reserve. Beyond fed up with government and politicians. These bastards freak when their power over society is threatened. There is no turning back. The genie is out of the bottle and no amount of legal framework can stop it.

It's all about protecting the illusion of power in paper money and herding the sheep. Control freaks are scared shitless of a world they can't control with their bullshit laws and dysfunctional governance. Fuck the old money system. It's about damn time humans wake from their slumber and realize Kings are going the way of the dinosaur.

The Federal Reserve has been poisoning our economy with "rat poison" since 1913. No other currency in the world is as valuable as Bitcoin and let's remember that TRUST, FAITH &amp; PERCEPTION in society drives the value and use of any currency.
Humanity can live without central banks and Bitcoin is showing the world it's possible to create a better currency using modern technology. We're at the beginning of a revolution in money and the more people adopt alternative currencies that aren't controlled by government -- but the PEOPLE -- the better off we'll all be.

Great news for sure. I think Coinbase's approach is excellent. Very exciting time for money.

The CFTC is useless. Try regulating the broken market that exists courtesy of the Fed and Washington.

So fucking sick and tired of the bastards in Washington. Sick of the criminals whom hide behind their own "power" from scrutiny. Sick of central banks devaluing paper monopoly money. Just sick of the entire farce we call government.
As long as people obey it in large numbers, we'll always be under the boot of thugs in society. If I could travel to a planet where life was built on logic instead of layers of lies (money, race, god, politics, etc) -- I'd do it.
