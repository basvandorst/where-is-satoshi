That makes you worse than either.

Once you invest, treat it as a sunk cost you ignore until you're ready to sell/invest more. I like the hype but it's caused me a lot of stress. Monitor the price then think about what you want before reading news like "btc about to crash/soar"

There's no way. Right now something like 40+% of the world's computing power goes to weather forecasting. [A bit dated]( but this says the official government computing power is about 5.75-6 petaflops. That's only 1 country's weather service. But even if bitcoin adds all new growth computing power to the equation wouldn't embedded processors and other IoT devices grow at a similar rate. If it ever even hit 50% of electricity consumed our society would then be placing hire value on mining btc than doing your actually job, we'd have doctors, farmers, ceos all not working to mine coins.

For the record I could definitely see something like 75-90%, of all new devices added in a year, interacting with the bitcoin protocol. But who knows maybe I'm wrong, we could literally ship every computer chip with a stripped down and/or hashed ledger up to the day the chip was cast on them, using it as a timestamp. Boom almost 100% adoption, and it's no weirder than utc.
