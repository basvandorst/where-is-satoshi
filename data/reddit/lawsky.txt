the fallacy is that inflation can be viewed by itself, the past twenty years merely looks that way because the rest lines up.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:04:40

So answer me this, how do you know green address doesn't have a 3rd key and it's actually 2 of 3? Or what happens if green address goes dark and you only have 1 of 2? No matter how you look at it, the ONLY guarantee that you coins are safe is if you make the addresses yourself.

@_date: 2015-06-04 19:48:42
Well, I'm saying they're all a risk for exactly your reasoning. Heck, even hardware wallets require an expert to verify. I prefer to just generate my own keys offline with my own software, taking all the risk onto myself. But for the majority there doesn't seem to be a good believable trust-free solution.
@_date: 2015-06-20 04:13:29
Why so people always turn to this fallacy? The part they leave out: When money was worth more, people made less. So it should be a groceries per hour worked measurement to account for inflation, pay increase, and cost of goods. Granted pay increase has indeed been lagging the other two the past twenty years...
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:50:41
I don't understand this. We are currently at 1mb per block which is about every 8-10 min. My phone could process that...... Is there some sort of exponential increase of processing power due to hash complication?? If we increased to 10mb or 100mb what kind of power would be necessary vs. current required power??
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:59:23

Learn to reload a hot wallet from offline cold addresses. Empty cold addresses completely each time you refill a hot address. Hot addresses are less secure but more convenient. It's like having multiple hidden safes and a few wallets with cash. Once you really understand it you can have a very secure system, signing your own offline transactions and such. It's actually pretty easy to do if you do it right.

Hey thanks! I have actually seen the second two documents, and the first is kind of irrelevant to my purpose. I think I have all the pieces, and the wiki link on secp256k1 is really what I'm trying to get to the bottom of. It just doesn't seem very straight forward... but then again it is cryptography. My main goal is to put the secp256k1 math along with the other crypto protocols directly into a generator app such that it is in its purest form.

How is this not practical??? You can setup almost any existing wallet to do this already. Or you could do it manually by creating a new address before each transaction. example: (old address = 1.5 btc) -&gt; (to recipient's address = 1.0) + (to new address = 0.5). Simple as that. This can easily be automated, and already is. And you really only need to tumble once, at the beginning, before all of the transactions, because any link to your identity will nullify the tumble all-together.

How large of a market cap/adoption would bitcoin need to achieve before we can have reliable bitcoin prices without looking up currency conversion rates? In other words, the price of a good displayed in bitcoin only changes when that products value changes.

This is my method, seems safer without the internet during generation:
1. Bitaddress.org files onto fresh usb directly from the Github site.
2. Ubuntu .iso image burned to disc
3. Shut down.
4. Reboot with Ubuntu live disc, disconnect hard drive first for extra security.
5. Generate addresses, use strong bip32 password.
6. Save QR codes as pdf or other document.
7. NEVER CONNECT TO THE INTERNET DURING 5 OR 6
8. Print multiple sdocumets or copy to multiple fresh usb drives and store in safe locations.
9. Store password in separate safe locations.
10. Move btc to new addresses.
11. Relax. When you need that money again, spend what you need, then repeat the process with new addresses and password.

I meant an IOU the owner can claim to anyone willing to accept it, similar to cash. Cash is essentially an IOU from the government, bitcoin is an IOU with instantly redeemable market value when an entity will accept it in return for goods or services.
I know it's not an IOU, meaning credit, but it works the same way when you go to redeem it, except an IOU would likely have very few people who would accept. Much like when a debt collector buys consumer debt contracts from companies.

I understand how the Trezor works and how it is safe to use. What keeps my private keys secure on this device? Can I back them up? Is it seed based? How many keys can it hold? Can it be hacked? Is it password protected? None of these explanations, all VERY important, are available on the website. I am VERY interested in purchasing, but the lack of info makes me skeptical/paranoid as I am sure most will be.
EDIT: So, after looking for a bit, I realized you could click the different items on the main page.

Short answer: There shouldn't be one!
Long answer: I think New York has a right to make whatever laws they want, provided their citizens approve... just as bitcoin companies have a right to not do business in New York. Hopefully another state will step up and propose a "bitfreedom" act to oppose the Lawsky Dogma, perhaps another country even. Do I think money laundering is a problem? Kinda. Do I think the bitcoin community can protect itself from Goxes? Surely. Do I think there are way better ways to catch major criminals than to stifle innovation and anonymity? Absolutely! Do I care? Yes! Do I think bitlicense will be passed as is? NO. Do I have all the answers? NO. Does the community? I hope so. Do I think bitlicense is just one more way to trap us into a police state? Absolutely!
I believe it is inevitable that the whole world will become one society. I also believe fiat's day are numbered. I believe bitcoin, so long as it keeps up with alts, IS the world currency of the future. I believe the only real crimes in the world are violence, theft, and oppression, and we can fight all three of these without controlling money, and without governments.
Do I believe in anarchy? NO! Large violent armies will form and go from town to town destroying everything. I believe we need some sort of democracy or social government, but not necessarily a "government body". I believe a world-wide decentralized democracy where everybody gets ONE vote, everybody can propose a law, and everybody can enforce the law WITH DUE PROCESS is what we NEED. How? I have no idea, but ALMOST ANYTHING is better then where I see us heading.

Bitcoin is priced by an average of the last trade on every market. (P1 + P2 + P3 .... + PN)/N = PA. Unless the last trade on every market was when someone sent someone else Bitcoin for free, Bitcoin will never be $0.

The program I wrote in python called "Python Bitcoin Keychain" (google it), so far as I know, is the shortest single-document copy-paste address generator. You could use the code as a guide. The only external reference is the 256 hashing, which is not terribly complicated. Overall, to answer your question, it really depends on how good you are at math. The elliptic curve part, and the hashing are definitely the hardest part by hand. Moreover, why would you want to?? If it's because you don't trust third parties, then learn python and use my code, it's very straightforward.

Yes, of course, and this is also compounded by the fact that a lot of private keys will be stored. That's why you shouldn't keep a lot of money in one address(among other things). The numbers I posted were to show the theoretical maximum. To put birthday logic into play here we could estimate that 23/366 of 2^116 is more likely. Therefore 2^112 years.

I am all for basic freedoms, but there are somethings that probably should be censored, you know, the extreme stuff. I think there is likely a way to implement basic censorship in a blockchain without it being too invasive. Just make it majority rule and open source, like bitcoin (hard forks, code changes, transaction reversal, etc.) and then just incorporate basic auto-censorship in the client.

No, true anarchy has no rules. Libertarianism has loose rules, based on an initial constitution, and changes can be voted in, but would require a very good reason.

You can't possibly interpret prophecy. If any of this bible-babble is real, Jesus doesn't want the world to be divided and fought over with giant earth-destroying machines, he wants peace and unity. HIS kingdom will come, and someday unite us all. For all you know, Revelations was merely a warning of "what not to do" when uniting the world, such that we may work on the behalf of the creator to make a much better world for everyone. A world no one has ever seen before. A world with NO leader besides HIMSELF, where ALL PEOPLE work together to live in harmony. Bees do it, so can we. Get your head out of your ass!

Anarchy is many things, it is everything, without a central something. 
Anarchy is the natural way, but in anarchy groups collected and powers formed. When powers gain too much power they get rejected, left behind, and overthrown. So, no anarchy is not JUST the collective implementation of defensive force, it is also EVERYTHING else. So, to say Anarchy is what we need is incorrect. We already have anarchy globally, and in such there are individual groups who work together. So, as a libertarian, one would promote a large group collaborating defense of individual safety and freedom ( a very difficult balance).

I mean, technically they could just go buy all the coins from all the exchanges and that'd do some damage. Or make millions of nodes and ruin the network. Or make thousands of fake accounts and become the majority of developers. But in the end, the community is likely going to notice, put measures in place to blacklist or reverse those actions, and call it a day. Besides, most powerful entities could probably benefit from bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-09 20:28:54

You guys are idiots if you are disagreeing with me. Bitcoins =/= $. When I say 100% to secure bitcoins, I mean you spend an extra $150 to secure a separate $150 worth of bitcoins. Total cost to obtain $150 worth of secure bitcoins = $300.
Scenario: you start with $300. Option 1: Put all into bitcoin, get hacked, lose everything. Option 2: Put half into bitcoin, half into trezor, have $150 of secure bitcoin.
In the second scenario it seems expensive, but, you can always add more bitcoins to the same wallet in the future without additional security costs. Also, in option two, your bitcoins could easily multiply in value giving you &gt;&gt;$300 worth of bitcoin&gt;&gt;$0.
Any questions?

**Lawyers' answers:**
Unfortunately, you may be in for quite a regulatory workup, depending on what precisely your business does. 
Let me ask you a follow-up: By "have a business," you mean you take local currency from clients, exchange it for Bitcoin, and then deliver the Bitcoin to the clients? If so, you fall under the definition of **"Exchanger"** based on a guidance letter published by the Treasury Department in March. 
As an "Exchanger," you would be required to follow regulations for Money Services Businesses (MSBs) under Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCen"). There are a handful of exceptions to that general rule, but only one of them appears to apply in your case: the **$1,000/person/day** exchange threshold. It seems that if you don't exceed this threshold, you won't run afoul of FinCen. 
**If you do wish to exchange currency in excess of $1,000/person/day, you would be required to register as an MSB with FinCen and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, and any other regulations imposed on MSBs.**

By definition, true libertarianism does not necessarily mean small government, it means reduced-power government. There is plenty of room for social healthcare, either by taxes or by individual groups providing for the whole. I believe a person should have the right to opt out of such taxes, but they also would opt out of the benefits.
@_date: 2014-08-13 03:05:53
For corperations on a certain level, people should demand transparency on taxes, just as transparency has been demanded of many bitcoin companies. the companies who don't comply will hopefully be shunned for their better counterparts.

You need to keep reading, from your source:
"Administrators and Exchangers of Virtual Currency: An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or **exemption** from the definition applies to the person. **FinCEN's regulations define the term "money transmitter" as a person that provides money transmission services, or any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means."** The definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies. Accepting **and transmitting** anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA. FinCEN has reviewed different activities involving virtual currency and has made determinations regarding the appropriate regulatory treatment of administrators and exchangers under three scenarios: brokers and dealers of e-currencies and e-precious metals; centralized convertible virtual currencies; and de-centralized convertible virtual currencies.
E-Currencies and E-Precious Metals: The first type of activity involves electronic trading in e-currencies or e-precious metals.13 In 2008, FinCEN issued guidance stating that as long as a broker or dealer in real currency or other commodities accepts and transmits funds solely for the purpose of effecting a bona fide purchase or sale of the real currency or other commodities for or with a customer, such person is not acting as a money transmitter under the regulations. However, if the broker or dealer transfers funds between a customer and a third party that is not part of the currency or commodity transaction, such transmission of funds is no longer a fundamental element of the actual transaction necessary to execute the contract for the purchase or sale of the currency or the other commodity. This scenario is, therefore, money transmission.15 Examples include, in part, **(1) the transfer of funds between a customer and a third party by permitting a third party to fund a customer's account; (2) the transfer of value from a customer's currency or commodity position to the account of another customer; or (3) the closing out of a customer's currency or commodity position, with a transfer of proceeds to a third party.** Since the definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies, the same rules apply to brokers and dealers of e-currency and e-precious metals."
Also, ["BSA regulations, as amended, define the term “money transmitter” to include a person that provides money transmission services, or any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. The term “money transmission services” means the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means. The regulations also stipulate that whether a person is a money transmitter is a matter of facts and circumstances, and identifies circumstances under which a person’s activities would not make such person a money transmitter."](

This is close to my concern for bitcoin. Bitcoin may be successful, but it holds promise to be separated into black and white. I'm sure if regulators had their way, anyone without 100% clarity of 100% of all activities will be found guilty of many crimes. We could very well be paving the road to a new level of police state, a new world order of law and money. Governments don't need to control the money if they control the avenues of getting and spending money. It'll be a race between giant governments and the collective unity of the tech savvy people.

Fair enough, although I think a general "suite" of bitcoin storage options should be available. Instead of having a seperate place for different options, just put them all in one spot, kinda like blockchain.info, but with vault options. Also, there should be advanced user support for those who wish to keep coins in your wallets/vaults. Allow advanced users to have access to their private keys for export, at least as an option so they could still have a "hands-off" wallet (vault) if they wish. I am liking coinbase, but I won't keep coins anywhere that I can't directly control if I wish. Also, can coinbase unlock the vault alone? Thanks!

Again, how do you measure "actual users" vs "accounts" when anonymity is allowed. I am all for anonymity, but when there is an obvious influx of unnecessary negativity and antagonizing, something needs to be done, provided, of course, we actual care about community and progress. Let's assume for a moment that mods are doing everything they can to keep up with and police the environment. If this is the case, then a bulk of the work could be automated without a downside. Sure the amount of "accounts" will be lowered, but this is a highly inflated statistic and holds no relevance to Reddit's or actual growth. For all you know, every single anonymous account is owned by three people, or one, or a hundred, or none at all (A.I.). I can respect your "extremist" views, but it's like saying if a murder happens we should either throw everyone in jail or no one at all. Ridiculous.

Keep multiple paper wallets. Each should have just enough to re-supply your hot wallet. Always empty each address completely and never re-use. It's pretty simple once you get use to it. I would keep about .5 btc in each cold address, and when my hot wallet runs low, just import .5 in. If your hot wallet gets compromised, just make a new one and start again. It's like cash in your wallet vs. cash in a safe. Just imagine each paper wallet as an individual safe with it's own code and a limited amount of cash(~$500 or less). Now imagine when your pocket-wallet gets low on funds, you just empty a safe into your wallet. You can even keep various amounts in cold storage to provide flexibility in your hot wallet.

I'll just leave this here:

Why not? The ledger merely proves that the money is not counterfeit and provides a way for you to prove a transaction took place. Bitcoin is perfectly fine without attaching names to addresses.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:54:54
The actual debate is LBC vs. Mycelium, and my point is escrow private key control is irrelevant.

I made a python key generator you could play around with, but it does not make transactions... Yet... Working on 2.0. Use at your own risk. Google "pastebin python bitcoin keychain".

For starters, I've been out of the game for a while. I stuck with good ole Coinbase to buy BTC because every other method I found was a hassle (open to suggestions). I am interested in doing some BTC/ETH trading but would like to keep my coins (BTC and ETH) in my own wallets (my keys, not theirs..) until ready to make a trade. I am looking for suggestions on exchanges, BTC wallets, and ETH wallets. Thanks!

We'll have to wait for the weak hands to exit, the awareness to sink in, the newcomers to buy, and the weak hands to rebuy.
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:45:22
like I said, I only sold a little then stopped, I have read the MSB laws. It only applies to people selling $1000 per person per day, which is waaay more that I was dealing with, and I would not have a problem with registering anyway because I want to sell them legally. 
The 10-20% is called profit, and is below par with other local sellers near me. People say they are willing to pay the markup instead of waiting for their bitcoins. One guy in particular said he wanted to buy custom stage lighting equipment from China for a discount, and BTC was the easiest way, but he didn't want to wait for coinbase. 
So to my questions: If I wanted to get legal and do this legally, how would I do it?
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:54:59
No, it doesn't.

I think this could be huge! Perhaps just a distributed ledger that could be hashed and verified. Anyone could post anything, and there would be meta tags and dates and such that could be searched for and displayed in the client. We could also vote on things. It would basically be a stripped down version of reddit but with articles instead of links.Edit: This could allow for all documents to become public forever. Also, tipping with bitcoin should be built in.

It's waaaaaaay better to pay even 100% for security than to lose 100% of your bitcoins.

btw, are you affiliated with bitsimple.com? Is that an exchange? Or is it more like coinbase? Your website is not clear on this, you need an "about" page or something.
EDIT: I found on google that you are like coinbase but you don't hold funds?? So by your definition you're a money transmitter and have paid for licensing??

Ah, so true. I am sudo-Christian. I follow the teachings as best I can, but I believe the bible is merely a human collection of different perspectives and has been overly collected and translated into a false doctrine. I believe the story of Christ is a great metaphor for many things, but I do not believe he IS GOD. If he ever actually existed, he was likely a highly enlightened human telling us we are all children of the ultimate spirit... something like that anyway.

I do not see a difference between anarchy and anarcho-capitalism. By definition, anarchy allows for capitalism. Also, if you would've read the link to the definition of aggression, it does not matter the reason. Agression can be used for defense. You can't change the meaning of words to suit your political agendas... well you can, like "republican" and "democrat" and "democracy" and "liberty" and "freedom" are all misused in today's politics.

It may say that in the King James version, but I have yet to find that exact quote in the Hebrew/Greek or older versions. Besides, if we are all children of "God", then so was he... that doesn't make him "God". Now there's also a part about him being "His only begotten son", but in reality that might have been a metaphor, who knows. The truth is, it's all just words on a page stabbing at truth. More wars have been fought over that book than anything else ever. It is a poison. If people only looked at the values, we would have a much better world. Look around you, that is where the real truth lies. We are all hideous creatures playing at something more than what is obvious and in front of us.

If you have the blockchain installed, you can have a script scan and count transactions per day/hour/week that are above 1btc, but there's no way to tell which outputs are change. I.E. If I had 3 btc and spent .5 you would see a transaction with two outputs and would have to assume the 2.5 as qualifying. Hope this helps!

Blockchain.info requires login, and I have a windows phone. But more importantly, it needs to be available to people without devices or without needing to install or learn anything.

Not that I am condoning or condemning, but I will state the obvious: THE BEAUTY OF BITCOIN IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE IT. No matter where you are, all you, or anyone else needs is internet access and the private key/s to control the coins. The trick is acquiring the coin and then liquidating, if necessary. Even if your intentions are legit, the person on the receiving end would likely want to convert to local currency.. for now. Anyway, just some OBservations.

Hi Tony, I've been waiting for a WP wallet, so thanks for that! I have installed it, seems to work, but I can't test it because all I have is my phone and bip38 WIF keys. It would be awesome if you guys would add in paper wallet support and allow qr code WIF importing. Thanks!

Perhaps converting all funds to bitcoin and having those bitcoins transferred to a cold wallet and then sign a specific transaction to prove control, all done with offline signing via fresh computers and qr code scanning. In this scenario, the only room for theft is either on the exchange account or an inside job. Clearly according to his explanation it was not the exchanges fault, bit his own. Theft or not, he and his company are solely responsible. To allow him bankruptcy would potentially allow him to run off with the money. I feel this is the central issue of third party services and is exactly why we need to make personal control of keys easy and secure for everyone (trezor???).

In the US, tax filing is voluntary and mostly unchecked until audited. Even if hiding money in crypto, there will likely be a point at which the USD was converted and can be questioned. Even if the crypto was the initial currency from some transaction, it would be no different than making up-trades with physical possessions. So long as there is evidence that you made a profit or own the money, you can be held liable.
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:50:09

I don't know why you're being downvoted. Buying offchain would only drive the price up once the seller bought back in. If you knew enough miners or bitcoin hoarders you could easily buy a million coins in a reasonable amount of time.

You should look into multi-sig. There are options where the attacker cannot take your coins no matter what they make you do. Of course this means you would have to trust at least one other person to move the coins. But they WOULD be safe if done properly. There is also the option of time-locking a transaction. If done properly it can be set up where you can only move the money during certain time periods.
@_date: 2015-04-12 04:14:45

With that much money you can add consecutive buy orders of 10000 coins. Don't buy all at once, that would be stupid, and impossible. Instead buy a few thousand, wait for the price to come back down. Buy another few thousand... Wait again, etc. Thus way you can save $ and gradually control the market upward. If people buy in rapidly and drive the price even higher, sell a few thousand. Keep doing this until you have made a substantial usd valued profit, then pocket the profits in usd and use the coins acquired to launch a country based on future tech including blockchain technologies. People will worship you and you will make billions.

Bitcoin is only a pyramid if the big bag holders bail out, but in order to permanently lower or destroy its value, people would have to stop using it. Bitcoin is useful, and the part of the bitcoin community that supports that usefulness is still secure--the core code and the block-chain, and will be secure so long as the majority of the users invested into the network want it to be. Just like the internet itself, people will doubt it right up until the point they rely on it.
EDIT: The same thing could be said about any other market. If the top bails, either everyone gets out, or the remaining recover.

Micro-payments will improve greatly with bitcoin. Your analogy is incorrect.

The important thing here is that the farmland market would tank due to the flood of supply. I suspect as a result, many existing corn farms would be re-purposed and lots of corn would also be sold, lowering the prices.

Just take a simple, open-source algorithm and place it on the transactions themselves. Per block, every "open" transaction would appear as normal, then all the "anonymous" inputs/outputs would get mixed and matched ensuring the recipient's get their coin, but they actually get them from a different sender. I'm sure this would still take time, that's why we need to start now. And so far as Dark Wallet, it's really not a good measure of the community's want for anonymity. If it were hard-coded and clear-cut, most people would accept the change.

It would be generated once two or more players are present, and perhaps use both clients to generate it. Both clients would then store it, I am not the best programmer but I know there is a way to store a password such that the user cannot see it until the program releases it. Of course they could modify the client or decypher the encryption algorithm, but that's why there would be a client to client hash check to verify clients are the same.
EDIT: For that matter, no passphrase is needed, just keep the private key hidden in the client until a winner is declared.

[A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A service mark is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods. The term "trademark" is often used to refer to both trademarks and service marks.
Must all marks be registered? No, but federal registration has several advantages, including a notice to the public of the registrant's claim of ownership of the mark, a legal presumption of ownership nationwide, and the exclusive right to use the mark on or in connection with the goods or services set forth in the registration.](

the client does. but only the winning client will release it. How is this different from storing the order of the deck? all clients need to know some secret things (private key, order of deck) without user being able to see it. Then the client releases secret to those worthy(flop cards, turn cards, then river, hole cards, etc.), so why not release the passphrase/key just like hole cards, except only after winning? and winning could be verified across clients.

I think you're trying to catch fire in a jar here. Bitcoin is great, but it's far from infallible. Like many hippies and communists, you sir are a dreamer. And for the record, most people would reject real education: looking at the facts as they are. I am not providing such education anyway, it is not worth my time to sling truths upon deaf ears.

No. He is saying using a third party to use bitcoin is the same as using bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:27:23
The coins have not moved, maybe to keep em rollin in?
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:14:48
No one. It would get generated on the spot under encryption, distributed between players before hand starts, then winner gets encryption password and private key is added to wallet. No need for third party.
1) All players must have coin in embedded wallet
2) Player1 creates table, sets rules.
3) Player2 joins/copies table
4) An encrypted address is randomly generated on one/both clients, and the random password is also encrypted(this might be the hardest part). Both clients need copy of these things in case one leaves table.
5) When players make bets they are sending coin to the generated address.
6) Once winner is declared via cards or forfeit, private key is decrypted and added to their wallet.
7) Start new hand.
8) Player can "cash out" by sending coins from wallet to wherever all at once.
I can see how it would be difficult to generate a private key without someone modifying their client code to reveal the passphrase until they win. Perhaps some sort of client hash verification should take place between the two clients to verify both legit before hand begins??
The game state/rules/encrypted key could also be distributed to other clients not at the table too for backup.
I really think this could be done.

A. The dollar wasn't designed by bankers. B. Nothing stops banks from using bitcoin like anyone else. C. Most people who will use bitcoin in the future will likely use a bank-like service to avoid the technicalities and risks (coinbase, circle, bitpay, etc.).

Same with any merchant.
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:17:05
multisig does not solve it. Once all signatures are present the attack can still take place in the transaction construction. But yes, I see your point about the separate wallet, but what if the malware waits for a larger wallet before enacting?

the control over the pot would be returned as soon as a player wins, all other players leave for a set amount of time, all other players fold, or any other end-game scenario. control would then be given to the winner. Someone would always end up with control at the end.

I just have to say, this is a true free market and manipulation does not exist in the traditional sense. We are ALL market manipulators, and whomever has the most money has the most potential influence. Inside trading, as well, only exists in a new fashion, mainly because there is no inside information in bitcoin, only the companies (including the Fed) surrounding it.

You seem to have proven yourself wrong here. We are saying avoid exchanges and services. People who hold their own coin usually do just fine.

@_date: 2015-02-22 07:13:57
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:54:53
have you considered generating/embedding an bip38 encrypted private key for each hand, then give the password and encrypted key to the winner of the hand or have it added to the winner's embedded wallet? It wouldn't be feasible to broadcast a transaction for every hand, but if someone collects private keys for each hand won, they could then generate their own transaction to move them all at once. I am interested in seeing this built. I have more ideas.
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:10:05
You do not need the blockchain to generate addresses. I want to make a scatter plot of private keys and public addresses without importing lists into matlab.

No. I am suggesting that ALL clients hold an encrypted pot.
I see what you are saying about the cards. There is no predetermined order, the cards are merely burned after being randomly drawn, and all clients keep track. So this would not work for secret key because secret key must be made before hand begins. 
That being said, which client chooses which card to draw? I imagine it would have to be a cross-client random?
Surely there is a way for all clients to keep the secret key hidden, and only when all clients agree on a winner, a hash is released to trigger ONLY the winning client (perhaps the hash is tied to that client) can unlock the key. There has to be a way, we need to think outside the box here. 
I don't have the answer, but it seems like you are giving up too early here.

IMO, protecting two keys is no different than protecting one is no different than protecting an encryption password.

It's definitely a grey area, but from what I have read, ANYONE SELLING BITCOINS IS A "MONEY SERVICE BUSINESS" AND MUST HAVE A FEDERAL LICENSE AND POSSIBLY STATE.
Please prove me wrong so I can go back to selling with peace of mind.

But let's say we couldn't trust the hardware, wouldn't it have to know which program I am using in order to modify the transaction?

I don't run out. I'm on a small budget as a student with a small income. I just barely get by with minimal food and bills. It is rough, by I manage.

Wow, I haven't seen someone be so confident and incompetent at mathmatical at the same time. Perhaps you should review permutations and combinations.

I don't feel like digging through piles of information right now, but I am curious if anyone has any info/links regarding what, if anything, had been done to prevent a 51% attack. I've seen the mining distribution charts, but it doesn't seem to far fetched for collision to happen or for a big investor to come in and dominate (like a government agency).
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:41:26
I still don't see the advantage

Yes, he could have said potato.

If we do, does coinbase have access? Or is it encrypted like BC.I?
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:41:53
Sure, I get that, cuz I make my own scripts, but what about everyone else?
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:47:53
Nope. You sir are an idiot. Securing bitcoin is simple. Coinbase is not secure.

1) I use a Windows phone, very inconvenient for BTC, but will likely be integrated into built-in wallet.2) how do we know greenaddress.it only has 1 key?

I've seen those symbols, but this one is lowercase with a horizontal slash.

I have provided plenty, you just don't get it. In order to get it you must learn thousands of things, of which I have not the time nor will to teach you. Deaf ears are those who ignore truth and fact because they are blinded by their ideals and emotions. How about instead of attacking me you explain how exactly you think your ideals will work without causing complete and utter chaos. Seriously though, one more direct attack on me and you will have proven you have no ground. Specifics or GTFO.

But they said ANYTHING legal, meaning also from companies that do not deliver.
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:35:25
Apparently not, cuz I've seen it before too.

So you need to breath?

Not all "responsibilities" are legitimate. I am a libertarian (not the Ron Paul kind), I am not a self centered douche. I am always looking to help those around me. Are you?
@_date: 2015-02-04 04:51:34
Doesn't okcupid accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:36:38
Exactly, but more importantly, anything outside the protocol itself IS NOT BITCOIN.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:59:28
You can also use coinbase, AND use your own wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:12:56
The problem with your assumptions is the misuse of the term "libertarian". I believe there should be a balance between state and liberty. Unfortunately the state is currently winning. But I am also a realist, and I realize we can't just walk away and expect things to keep on ticking.


Yes. But "need" is a very malleable term. I've seen many people abuse these systems. I have used a few, but only when I felt trapped. I think the existing social services would be much better if things like drug-testing and/or reference checking were implemented. But in reality, if more people just helped people directly, like I do, then these programs would be obsolete. But, I transgress, because people tend to be selfish, such is our survival-of-the-fittest-cause-we're-all-gonna-die nature.
Glad to see you finally hear what I am saying though, thought for sure you would never believe I was actually poor.
