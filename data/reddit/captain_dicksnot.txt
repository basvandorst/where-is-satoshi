Before Standard Oil, people used wood and coal to heat their homes.  This caused horrible air quality in every city in the USA, and people had all of the pulmonary problems that accompany it.  It was a huge problem in the industrial age.
Due to innovative practices and vertical integration, by the time Standard Oil was broken up, kerosene had become so cheap that even poor people could afford it, and most people had switched to kerosene for heating. 
Standard Oil nearly monopolized the market by delivering the best product at the lowest price.  Rockefeller was so damn good at business that his competition simply could not keep up.  Yes, he bought out competitors, and yes, he had a near monopoly at one point, but he got there by giving the consumer the best product at the lowest price.  He never did anything otherwise.  He did not gouge the public, he did not harm the consumer in any way.
And when his competitors decided they'd had enough, they ran a smear campaign to scare the public, and enlisted the help of some of their senator friends to break up Standard Oil.  The myth that Standard Oil was playing the game unfairly, that they were harmful to the public, that the government saved us from them, persists even today.  In fact, Standard Oil was incontrovertibly good for the public, but even if that were not the case, Standard's market share had already declined from 90% to 65% by the time the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed.  Why is that?  Because despite what you learned in high school sociology class, organic monopolies cannot persist to the detriment of the consumer, provided property rights are protected.  
But you go ahead and continue believing the line that the only thing standing between freedom and slavery is our benevolent old friend, Uncle Sam.  In reality, persistent monopolies in a free market are *always* government sanctioned.

People who say that are idiots, and no matter how strong your arguments, there will always be a subset of people who believe that.  It's best to ignore them.

The free market gave you literally every creature comfort that you enjoy in life.  
You are dumb.

Wrong, dipshit.  As the title says, when I bought, I paid ~10% more than the prevailing market rate on MtGox, and when I sold, I was paid ~10% less.

If you think his concerns are legitimate, you're either ignorant or stupid.

Just use both.  It's not that complicated.  Have 1k uBTC?  That's 1 mBTC.  Just like the metric system, which is what everyone's eventually going to use anyways.

Do you think that decentralized currencies spring fully formed from the forehead of Zeus?  
These things take time to be implemented.  
Now you may think it a bit harsh to call you an idiot at this point, but one has to do little more than rub two brain cells together to find answers to these concerns.  
You and the OP are either idiots or a trolls.

The early days of the wild west were wild, just like the early days of anything are, and that includes bitcoin.  Sorry you got screwed, and they obviously shouldn't have done that, but frankly, you knew (or should have known) that there was risk involved with allowing some other entity hold your bitcoin.

I've been actively trading stocks and studying finance and economics for six years.  I have enough insight into financial markets, history, economics, and human behavior to realize that your concerns are simplistic and exaggerated.  You are applying the same expectations you have for established currencies to one which is in its infancy, thus completely ignoring the context of the situation.  Yes, there are concerns, but they are minor.  No new technology is ever perfect at implementation, but if the core idea is good, it persists, and the kinks are ironed out over time.  The core idea of bitcoin is good; the concerns are minor kinks.  That you fail to realize this tells me that it is *you* who are ignorant of basic economy, history, etc, etc.  Thus, you are either being willfully ignorant for trolling purposes, or you are just an idiot, and I refuse to waste time on trolls and idiots, hence my dismissal of your concerns outright.  Now stop bothering me.

Jimmy Wales is a well-known libertarian.  I can't believe he's allowing this to occur.

* I "could" win the lottery.  
* Gravity "could" reverse itself.  
* Obama "could" be a closet Muslim homosexual antichrist.
* Anne Hathaway "could" be waiting for me when I get home tonight.
"Could" is a weasel word (google it), and means absolutely nothing.  Any time you see an article titled with the word "could," if you examine the content, you'll almost always find that the article's complete horseshit.

I've been investing in the stock market for about 7 years now, and I'm pretty successful at it.  I tried daytrading once, just to see whether I could do it, using only my gut to make trades.  Hell no.  Trading any commodity in a marketplace is one of the biggest mindfucks you can ever experience.  If you don't have a system in place, you will lose, period.

Low liquidity *is* a minor concern, you moron.  
The current state of bitcoin is inextricably tied to its future state, as they are one and the same thing.  As I've said repeatedly, to view the state of bitcoin out of context and to therefore hold it to the same standards that one would to a fully mature currency is absurd.  Only a fool or a troll would do that.
Now please: go read an article or something.

So the wallet that was created when I created the address that I told coinbase to send them to - that has the all-important key, right?  So if I understand this correctly, without that key, I can never do anything with the coins, yes?  
So the wallet doesn't store any actual bitcoins, just the keys?  And when I want to transfer my coins somewhere, I... I don't know what happens.  Can you recommend a good website which breaks down the process?

Seems everyone here's in denial that this occurs.  I'm sure I'm not the only one.  I still made a nice profit, but I'd have made ~$500 more had coinbase not ripped me off.
