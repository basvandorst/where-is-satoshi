It is only instigated when there is evidence of potential corruption. They file a suit against you to prove that it isnt. They take no action other than a court summons until proof of guilt.

Having read the article it sounds like they have prior evidence of fraud and embezzlement by the husband of the lady. The land was purchased by a bank. The unknown seems to be for those cases that can prove that their wealth is legitimate and no action against the property will be taken until it is proven otherwise. Clickbaity title but a genuine concern for how long until the wording is altered for the benefit of the state over the people.

Tbf, I was heading into the military back in 2010 and was contemplating dropping $300 on Bitcoin but I just couldn't find enough info on it at the time to feel comfortable with the investment. Fuck me I say

Internet definitely completely reinvented how we transmit and view information of all types, electricity reinvented power transmission allowing for further reach of industry thus breaking the need for hydro and steam powered items....like idk what you are talking about. Bitcoin might have been experimental at first but at the present day it feels as if it is here to stay.

Does anyone else find it concerning that in the first paragraph the representatives try to make it seem like the Federal reserve has constitutional power?
