Trust me after 10+ years of use you know its BS
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:05:07
I consider it collateral damage, would have spent the same amount if not more on drugs or gambling! Instead of gambling/buying drugs i put that money towards my bitcoin wallet instead. Up or down dont really care, the amount in my account would be 0 anyhow because i can't handle money like an adult person. (Each monthly salary i place 5% into bitcoin instead of dumb shit)
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:40:54
I do pocket some but far from greedy i sell to mostly 60+ cancer patients (illegal for them with Thc in sweden but they prefer it over opiates)
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:42:59

@_date: 2018-06-25 22:54:55

I wish i could afford to give up my job so i could spend more time helping him clear the woods around his house. (He is 90+) but still doing building projects!
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:06:08
In my excellent evaluation of bitcoin pricing i think "what would the average joe do?" in any case, and use myself as an example.
I was drunk and bought last night.
