I would recommend using [Armory]( 
I would create both a usb flash drive backup and a paper wallet at the least, but 3 or 4 of each in different very safe places would protect you even more.

1% fee to buy on Coinbase + ~.0001 BTC/transaction vs. 1%-5% cc processing fee etc.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:09:10
The cost of credit card fees are typically passed on to the customer, at least partially. Merchants must pass on some of this cost to survive in the current market. 
If cc fees are removed from the equation, pressure from competition will begin to push in the opposite direction, forcing merchants to pass on some of the *savings* to consumers. 
Discussing what is fair or what either party is entitled to is irrelevant in this situation. The "freeish" market will decide on fair allocation of credit card fee savings between merchants and consumers. Both parties will benefit in a great majority of cases.

Dooglus and others (Dean at BetKing) have returned investor funds in full and have been completely transparent about operations. There are a few sites that disappeared with bankroll funds, but I feel obligated to correct you on Dooglus' rep.

I started buying toward the top of the last big bubble, and obviously things have worked out for me. As kryptomancer said, if you believe in the value of the technology, it is worth buying a small amount on a regular schedule (dollar cost averaging). This is the only smart way to invest. The price seems high, but is about where one would expect given the exponential growth associated with network effects and tech adoption.

I agree that use of BTC in financial transactions is absolutely critical to Bitcoin's survival long term. I think that rise in price is also important at this stage of the network's development. 
Volatility in price attracts media attention, which I think can only be a good thing for Bitcoin. As long as people take the time to notice Bitcoin and try to learn something about it, most people will realize how much utility it holds and maybe buy a few mBTC or at least tell a friend they think it's a useful technology. If BTC price continues to rise, this will encourage more and more speculative buying. 
Here's the important piece of my argument: Deflation is not something to worry about. The somewhat predictable deflationary nature of Bitcoin will make merchants as interested in accepting BTC for purchases as buyers are in keeping their BTC. This will lead to merchants offering discounts on products if they are purchased in BTC, stimulating BTC spending.
[This]( is the same chart I posted in a reply above. It shows an exponential increase in number of bitpay transactions along with the exponential increase in bitcoin price. This chart only shows number of transactions, not transaction volume, so it could potentially be misleading. 
However, an increase in number of transactions signifies increased public attention and an increase in the number of people using bitcoin for transactions, which is arguably more important than volume right now. 
Does this make sense? Anyone care to respond?

I tried out [SatoshiPoker.org]( this month, and it's great. I would also recommend trying out [SealsWithClubs.eu]( The competition is a little tougher on SWC, but there are more players and higher stakes available. 
Poker is one of the only games in which long term profit is possible. This is because you are primarily playing against other players rather than the house. If you outplay your opponents, you and the house both win. gl!

The swings are going to get bigger and bigger as the price increases unless enough people adopt bitcoin (buy and hold long term). What this graph is telling you is that based on the graphs trend alone it seems like each BTC should have a value somewhere around $100-$20,000. It's impossible to nail down a value for BTC based on price charts. This is why David Woo and others perform valuation of BTC etc. using fundamentals. The idea is to calculate what a BTC is actually worth so that you can make some money off of the errors of the aggregate market. If you think you know the value of a bitcoin better than the market, buy and hold. 
The useful information contained in this graph is in the overall growth trend of BTC prices. As many others have said, BTC may well fall to $300 overnight, but imo it is extremely likely that there will be an upswing following every downswing that dwarfs all previous "crashes". This has been the result of every downward correction so far, and I believe the pattern will continue unless there is a catastrophic change in the ***fundamental*** value of the bitcoin protocol (its usefulness).

I'll check it out. That could work well. I would like to somehow offer prepaid tutoring hours that could be bought through the site directly. Any way to do that? 
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:15:30
This still wouldn't allow the customer to choose how many *hours* they would like to buy, right? I want it to be possible for someone to buy 13.5 hours or something rather than a set number like 10 or 100. Is there a way I can do that?

Yeah I know that. It's not that hard for me to change the code on the site every once in a while. I will certainly generate a new address for in person transactions. Is there any reason to do this aside from security concerns?
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:33:50
Yeah it's looking like that might be the way to go. Do you think Coinbase is easier/better than Bitpay?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:42:37
This is a great way of thinking about bitcoin. It is nowhere near a typical currency or asset. I've been thinking about how I can contribute to the development of my moon acres and the bitcoin network. I'm planning to add a bitcoin payment option to my website shortly.

Doesn't this article claim that the top ~0.1% own half the market cap of bitcoin? That seems worse than the top 2% owning half.
That said, I don't think this is a problem because: 
* Those early adopters will be selling coins faster than they buy them.
* The source of their wealth was their support of the bitcoin network in its infancy rather than control over the network as it is functioning today. The fiat 1% derive a constant revenue stream by choking it out of the financial market with their power over the means of transaction etc. This is not the case with early adopters of bitcoin. They have lots of fish, but this gives them far less power long term than would a fishing pole.
* I would guess that the world will be much better off in the hands of the bitcoin 1% than in the hands of the fiat 1%. 
Perfect systems don't exist in finance (at least in practice), but relative to fiat systems that are currently collapsing around the world, bitcoin approaches perfection.

Watching BTC/USD price on a log scale is much more useful than on a normal scale. This log scale chart is much more indicative of the pattern BTC price has followed since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin is growing exponentially as do many tech companies in the first 4 or 5 years of development. To see this pattern, you must use a log scale chart. This is explained very well at  Bitcoinwisdom.com offers log scale BTC charts under settings.

Yeah I would agree. I'll give it a try asap. Thank you very much for your help.

This. There are a lot of new speculators this month, but there are also genuine adopters of the technology and the long-term investment opportunity getting involved. A huge majority of those people bought in at above 600. 
It's important not to discount the frustration that new adopters are facing right now. If you emphasize the fact that it is up from where it was two weeks ago, this may not be very encouraging to many of the new adopters with a real interest in supporting the network. 
It might be a good idea to give them a chance to get used to what it feels like to lose 50% in a day and watch it recover and pass 1200 again as it ***will*** do in the coming weeks or months. Losing 50% if you jumped in at 1200 is a huge loss in typical investing, but it is a small loss compared to the huge potential growth of bitcoin that is still very likely. This is an investment that does not behave like anything that the public has seen in the past because bitcoin is being publicly traded so early in its development.

Could you clarify exactly what you mean by this?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:04:15
Could you please clarify what you mean by "I wouldn't say it's exponential growth"? If you mean that the exponential effect is probably due to speculation alone, I disagree.
[Transactions on Bitpay]( are keeping pace with the rising price very well. This indicates to me that the payment network and use of bitcoin is growing exponentially, supporting the same pattern in price increase. Any thoughts?

That would be the [Stochastic RSI]( I'm not sure how useful it is for trading BTC, but I've used it a lot with stocks, and it makes it easier for me to think about price trends. I would (and did) ignore technical indicators and invest long term if you think the Bitcoin technology holds value.
