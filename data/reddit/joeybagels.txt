What?  Someone who is good at one thing, thinks they are good at everything.  Inconceivable!

tl;dr; 
when will I be rich?

what do you do with these gold plated bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:01:59
I hope so.  I'm sitting on 3 BTC I was too lazy to cash out.  Sometimes laziness pays off!

Are you kidding me?  There's no way to predict.  Someone just bought a Lamborghini with ~200 BTC, which, 2-3 years ago would have seemed ***incredibly*** unlikely.

I don't doubt the wisdom of the man willing to give out blowjobs when proven wrong.

Not too impressed with Inifiniti Poker, so far.  I sent an email to their support email address yesterday and haven't heard anything.  Oh well, guess I'll stick to Seals With Clubs, but it's nice there's some competition in the Bitcoin poker space.

what if he's gay?
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:21:11
I guess I should have been more specific, are they real bitcoins or just some novelty item?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:19:21
yea, it's way more complex than mortgages and derivatives and most anything related to investing.

I tried installing the windows client and I'm getting this error:
I'm on 64-bit, windows 7
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:29:24
No worries.  I got it running on my computer at home, but not my work computer.  I think it's an issue with the .Net Framework on my work computer.
I was able to log in at home, but I couldn't find anyone playing.

What if he's a hermaphrodite?

are you going to have freerolls?
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:11:00
At first I thought this was a euphemism.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:41:09
that's pretty cool.  I was thinking if they had real coins that could be used as a wallet, that would be pretty cool.  Right now I have a paper wallet and it just doesn't feel as legit as if I had a real coin.

I think if you try to stick with the mentality that you don't actually own the money until you sell, it's easier to stick around for the long haul.  Worst case scenario is that BTC's become worthless and I'm out my initial $340 investment.  Best case scenario is they go through the roof.
