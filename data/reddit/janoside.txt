Another option for accepting bitcoin might be to use the peer-to-peer marketplace [OpenBazaar]( Version 1.0 was very recently released.

They're good questions you're asking. The answers are largely unknown...by anyone. In "traditional" stock investing, with the exception of high-frequency algorithmic trading, "wise" long-term investors (think Warren Buffet) are always trying to understand the "fundamentals" of what they're investing in and selecting based on those fundamentals. With stock investing there are different ways of evaluating the fundamentals of an investment that stock-market investors are well versed in. In the crypto space, everything is too new and too unknown for any reliable measures to exist. But, as someone who is still long bitcoin, I'll share some of the "fundamentals" measures/ideas that I see as bullish for bitcoin. These are all my personal opinion and are in no particular order:
Positive Fundamentals
- Mining investment/infrastructure. The security of the bitcoin network is unrivaled. Bitcoin has already weathered the storm while ASICs were developed/deployed which, compared to baseline Moore's law, was a very, very fast run-up. Such a fast run-up presented a major centralization risk that *should* level off now that the rate of efficiency improvement has leveled off (due to ASIC hardware matching current-generation processor architecture)
- Strong, decentralized development team. Bitcoin's first-mover advantage garnered many benefits including the interest and effort of the largest group of specialized developers from the cryptography/distributed systems/cypherpunk communities during the time when it was the only show in town. Certainly many aspects of bitcoin's first-mover advantage will be watered down with time, but this is still a "sticky" strength.
- Demonstrated resistance to change. The Great Scaling Debate/War has raged for years. Whichever side you're on, one can't deny that bitcoin has been incredibly resistant to change (segwit2x cancellation, segwit upgrade delayed by a year, bitcoin unlimited, etc) . While some may consider this a disadvantage, I, for one, consider it a crucial property as it moves toward large scale adoption and waves of uninformed investors flow into the ecosystem. The principles at the core of the system are safeguarded by this change resistance.
- Simplicity and conservatism. For my mental models Ethereum provides the best counterpoint for this issue. One can certainly make a good case for the value of excitement within the Ethereum smart-contract community. Many less experienced developers can join in the fun of the "blockchain revolution" by making little cryptocurrency toys. But for me, the term "toys" (or experiments) captures the essence of most of the development in that space. Not that it's not fun and interesting...it is, but for my money, I prefer a system that seeks to go slow and steady, building up knowledge and experience carefully as we all try to figure out the properties of this huge socio-economic experiment that is cryptocurrency. We've seen that the founders of the internet itself have been disappointed with the centralization that has crept in over the decades that it's been in operation and I'm hopeful that the technologists guiding bitcoin's development are fighting tooth and nail for decentralization at every stage of development, not giving in to the enticing slippery slope of centralization. (I often wish there were better metrics for measuring decentralization, but given the newness of this space I accept that there aren't and that a sometimes overly cautious/conservative approach is needed in terms of technology decisions).
- The fee market. One of the biggest open questions in cryptocurrency is: What happens in the long term? Bitcoin is such an attractive currency because it has a finite supply. But, how does the system stay secure when all coins are mined and the block subsidy disappears? Of course, the answer given our current knowledge is that a fee market emerges and finances mining. Despite the obvious pain that the community as a whole is feeling about high fees and long confirmation times, I'm thrilled that we've collectively come so far testing the fee-market solution to long-term security. Who knows what we might learn between now and the time that fees will be crucial, but the system has kept humming along as intended as fees have shot up. I hope for fee reduction as much as anyone and look forward to being able to use bitcoin for small transactions again in the future, but with any complex, long-term engineering project you want to do a "feasibility study" to make sure you're not running full-speed toward a brick wall.
- It's battle hardened. The system is the product of the cryptography/security/cypherpunk community which imbues it with the adversarial/defensive thinking of the people in those communities. If there's an attack, those people want to anticipate it and ensure the things they build are resilient against it. I've seen plenty of examples of current bitcoin developers employing such adversarial thinking in the design of changes to the system which gives me lots of confidence that such thinking has been enacted at every level.
- Many powerful constituencies at odds with one another. Bitcoin has many powerful people/groups invested in its success, many of whom are in conflict with one another, and many of whom are interested in it as a tool of control (e.g. market manipulators). The various constituencies within the bitcoin ecosystem (users, miners, businesses, developers, exchanges) provide natural checks and balances on one another, to the benefit of all (see "change resistance" point above).
Negative Fundamentals
- Mining centralization. Despite being hopeful about this issue in the long term, it's still in a worrying state. I hope to see more competitive ASIC hardware emerge and see hashrate spread out geographically.
 
- It's the biggest target. When you're playing King of the Hill, everyone is gunning for you when you're on top. Many smaller projects are diluting bitcoin's name recognition to the confusing detriment of new investors (who then harbor and spread resentment about the whole ecosystem), various interest groups are always trying to take over control of the system, newer projects with more "excitement" (simply by virtue of being new) may garner more interest from developers entering the space, etc. Of course, this is a double-edged sword that cuts *for* bitcoin too as, due to its adversarial core it becomes more resistant the more it's attacked.
- It's old and "boring". "Everyone knows about bitcoin. Have you heard of X?" It's hard to keep up mindshare in such a big space. This is very much a social problem and I believe a relatively small one, since the people having such conversations tend to not understand enough to be of any consequence.
- Exchange centralization. Coinbase is big and powerful and has shown themselves to be relatively poor stewards of their high position. Again, depending on your scaling-debate leanings you may be a fan of some of their recent actions, but I think everyone in the community can agree that they are and have always been dangerously poor communicators, concerning frozen funds, account closures, delayed trades, and the timing of development of new features. Many in the community periodically advocate for decentralized exchanges, but they are clearly much more difficult to use and probably have properties that make them unworkable at the large scales that the ecosystem needs. I hope I'm wrong, but I think this issue will be a constant struggle back and forth...luckily it applies to all cryptocurrency equally.
I'd love to hear more positive and negative "fundamentals".

Just want to leave this note here: seed words should never be stored in electronic form. Write them on a piece of paper and store in a safe place.

Good luck. You need to trust a lot of software en route to your (probably) safe encrypted state.

According to blockchain's accounting it's BTC.TOP. See here: 
And yes, as the other commenter said, 12.5 is the block reward and the rest are the aggregate fees of all of the transactions in the mined block.

Yea, that's fine. I'm trying to capture the ease of use - set it up, start it up, and you're good to go. Any other term you'd like to offer for the purpose? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:28:31
This is what's often referred to as a "blockchain explorer". The purpose of such tools is to browse/navigate/"explore" the blockchain, which is essentially the database that underlies the Bitcoin network. Other open source explorers exist, but often require building another internal database, aside from the Bitcoin blockchain. Building the internal database consumes a lot of storage space and requires a lot of time and processing to build. Some of the benefits of being stateless are avoiding the storage space used by a separate database and the startup time associated with building... Not to mention the operational simplicity of not needing to maintain such a database.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:55:28
As DJBunnies indicated, my use of the term stateless is not great. In this case, I'm using the term simply to mean database-free, meaning the tool does not use/build a database but instead just directly uses the data it requests from the BTC node you point it at. If you'd like to learn/understand more about the data that a BTC node offers, you can read more here:

Cool. I like "database-free" and have updated the project description accordingly. Thanks!

They know. They are intentionally muddying the water concerning the name "Bitcoin".
