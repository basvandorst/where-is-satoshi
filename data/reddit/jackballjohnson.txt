wow this is exceptional! The first person I've met that has a valuation model for Bitcoin. Could you please explain it to me? I haven't met a single person on here that can give me a valid valuation model for bitcoin..

Nope, was referring to the DeCSS and other ripping programs for DVDs that are still illegal under US and International law.

I see where you are coming from, however the lawyers and judges represent the government-  HULK SMASH is all that comes to mind. However nuanced the argument that Bitcoin is protected free speech code, those in power will not cede power, especially when it comes to the coin of the realm. I like your point, but the reality is, they will come up with a way around the first amendment argument.

No Sonny, I'm talking from years of investing experience. You go run along and trust the report made by the guys who have a huge incentive to say what they say.  I bet you trust the investment reports from banks who do the underwriting of that same company.  Gee they're taking them public and they also give them an Strong Buy rating... Must be a great investment! *Sarcasm*

And just so you understand where I'm coming from, that Facebook information about their currency was leaking out for months, that's why it moved, and that's also why when it was released publicly you saw the last bit of the bump up. Facebook is an enormous company with thousands of employees, and overtime that kind of thing will leak out, Even though it's illegal and considered insider trading, that's just how the world works.

What you think coinshare has no dog in this fight? Of course they make up some ridiculous number like that. Renewables are more expensive than coal, no one mining will sacrafice a dime of profit to use clean energy over a cheaper form when it accounts for 90% of their costs. You are very naive. I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you too.

Gold costs almost nothing to mine, the value of gold has absolutely nothing to do with the cost of it's extraction. Gold's value is mostly based on what people are willing to pay for it. It's a hedge against inflation. There are similarities to Bitcoin, but it's not a like for like. Go read about gold bugs and their newsletters, they sound a lot like this place at times.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:43:03
you do realize that this research article completely contradicts the one you sent me about clean power usage in China? Usually discrepancies like this create a problem with underlying assumptions, wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:09:29
First your logic is seriously flawed. But let's say you're right and miners in China use 80% clean energy. I don't believe that for one second, but let's for sale of argument say this is true. What you're telling me is that miners are stealing energy from other industries that must then use coal fired powerplants. The pollution issues, which the person responding to my information about gold mining brought up, are therefore worse in China precisely because Bitcoin is taking up hydro power that could be used for actual industries instead of polluting the air with CO2 from coal plants. You lose either way smart guy.  If there were no miners in China that hydro power would go to actual industries that need the power and therefore reduce the carbon footprint in China, which is growing faster than anyone in the world.  What was that snarky comment about checkmate?

Again I don't believe a word of anything from sites that are selling me, but I will read it for a laugh. I think you are foolish to cite a source that has their own interests at heart. Independent research is valuable and not free on the internet. I never called you a dumbass, or a loser. I'm a skeptic, I don't believe anything I read and especially not from a source that is selling me. Skeptics make money, I know that from experience.

Phew the heat is melting the flakes here
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:18:20
Depends how you define cost. If I told you, over the last ten years you could predictably make a profit of 400 to 1000 Per Ounce, without fail, it doesn't matter what your costs are. The key is it's predictibility.  Bitcoin fluctuates wildly, and while that may be fine with people here, gold mining has zero correlation with Bitcoin mining. The variable costs are almost zero in mining gold, the depreciation of the sunk costs (the mine and equipment) are also deductible and lower the mining company's taxes, increasing their profit and further lowering costs.   
Bitcoin is the exact opposite. The highest expense is the energy, which means it has a high variable cost and still has sunk costs (the servers, the rented space).   
Also the market for gold dwarfs Bitcoin. 
For example, last year, the MOST gold EVER was mined. 3,260 metric tons, or 124,993,240 ounces of gold. In ONE year. That's the equivalent of $176.4 Billion in a single year. Bitcoins total market cap today is about 190 billion, a little more than the yearly production of gold. The two are almost incomparable.  A high market cap for gold means that if some goldbug whale dumps a shit ton of gold in the market it barely makes a dent in the price. Bitcoin, well one whale unloads and everyone is smelling like whale shit for a month. That, also, is a cost of Bitcoin. 
So yes, there are costs to mining gold, I think I've made a good case as to why these are miniscule in comparison to Bitcoin.
That's not to say Bitcoin has no value, but to say it's value is related to it's mining costs or some sort of stored energy is hogwash.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:20:27
No, quite the contrary my friend. In fact, investing requires no faith at all.   
Faith is the surrender of reason. Or as Mark Twain said, "faith is believing what you know ain't so."   
Investing requires knowledge, which is the opposite of faith.

@_date: 2019-07-16 18:47:20
you must not be reading my replies that carefully which is fine, but if you go back and look, my original posting had nothing to do with CO2 emissions. I was replying to someone who is not that bright who claimed that gold mining was worse for the environment then the CO2 production from Bitcoin. Gold mining while not great for a local environment isn't going to destroy the entire planet.  
I'm going to be dead in 30 years, and I doubt the environment will turn into Venus by then, so I don't have a horse in this race. You might, and your children might. But I'm single, I have no ties, and my reply to his original comment is what started this whole thread. So like I say, relax Francis. And if you don't understand some of my replies, many of them are lines from movies,. Which are flying over your head. But that's okay! I'm still enjoying our conversation and hope that you can too.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:25:39
I just read it, and I will go and look at his data, but do you really feel comfortable with his theory? He even states it's a theory that's unproven. He also states multiple assumptions which I don't believe. I have friends in renewable energy here in the states, and some of his assumptions are flat out wrong about power being stranded and lost. He says he does a bottom to top analysis, but fails to provide any real conclusions. this isn't research, this is an opinion, and while I will take a look at his supposed data behind it, there are far too many assumptions in this for me to even consider it as a quantitatively or qualitatively decent report. This is hogwash, what I said in the beginning holds true. they are pushing and selling an agenda, and you buy into it because that's what you want to believe. I'm a skeptic and I will be proven right in the long run.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:05:38
I don't need to give you sources, the information is out there go look it up yourself. And also it's common sense, if someone is supporting something I mean for Christ's sakes their name is literally coinbase. You think I'm going to trust their 'research'?  It's biased, go look at your electric bill, call your provider, coal is cheaper.

I learned from your post, and there's nothing better then open inquiry for learning, so thanks for sharing your speech and your time.

bro you are so wrong! Why does everyone think I'm a boomer just because I'm a skeptic? And I wasn't referring to the environmental impacts of Bitcoin at all, that was another poster who brought that up. My reference to Bitcoin aging me was watching it fluctuate by thousands of dollars every day. The stress is driving me nuts. You said I have fomo but you have no idea how many bitcoin I own. Your assumptions are laughable which makes me realize you know nothing about anything else either. Especially not anything about me. Relax and read what I said and don't make things up in your head. I'm a Gen xer not a boomer, that is such an insult on so many levels I don't even know where to begin. And while you don't realize it yet, you are exactly the same as boomers, you're the largest generation, you're in a new era, and you are going to end up just like they are now.
