He's suggesting that people donate via Bitcoin mainly because they would have made a "profit" were they to sell the Bitcoin back for local fiat currency, and simply don't feel bad to spend the "profit" that they made no recurring action in which to earn ("free money", basically. Except it technically isn't.)
EDIT: I use "free money" in more of a laymen's conceptualization. I know there is no such thing as "free money" in currency speculation.

For regular banking needs, I use these guys:  because [they don't have any bullshit fees.](

Yes, and the only fees are those assessed by the ATM operator. They do not charge "foreign network" fees. ("foreign" here has nothing to do with countries, but refers to ATM networks your bank is not a member of, say your card is STAR and Pulse, and your bank will charge you to use a PLUS network ATM because that is a "foreign" ATM network.)
Also, because Simple is owned by BBVA, use of BBVA ATMs in Mexico and Spain are completely fee-free, since, well, you're a customer of that bank.
