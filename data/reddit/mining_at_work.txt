Bitcoin maximalism is a valid school of thought. However, as you note, the market strays from the philosophy.
So a FTFY might be:


Even [Overstock invests in altcoins]( Bitcoin antimaximalism simply presents more diverse opportunities to accumulate wealth. And accumulating wealth is what the market acts upon.

This is going to be invaluable to the Bitcoin community. People are embarrassed to ask "what is Bitcoin?" Now they can go watch an entertaining and easy to watch documentary in their own privacy and feel like they are more than moderately educated on the ~~subject.~~ phenomenon! TTM

Correct me if I'm wrong, but an app/altcoin could not be supported by any of these innovations if the economic model for the coin was hyperinflationary and required a limitless supply. Sidechains, for example, do have a limit to how many indivisible units can ever be created.
(Of course, that leads to a debate as to whether or not there'd ever be a demand for such an economic model... but that's not my point right now)

I am Bitcoin proficient, but security illiterate. This product appears to be worth my money, and I will likely purchase if someone could weigh in about:
* The potential vulnerabilities in this product/process
* What this product/process would need to make the potential vulnerabilities negligible (by both the publisher and end user)
* How we can know we can trust the publisher

I am surprised it's not been mentioned (or maybe I missed seeing it?) that **Scrypt ASICs** are being "tested" by manufacturers. I haven't looked at the volume to verify, but it seems likely that they may be mining Litecoin with them, exchanging them to BTC and then selling them for USD.

I'd really like to see bitpay open themselves up to the bitcoin community for investments. I'd love to own some equity. even if it's just a little bit. maybe do something similar to maidsafe?

I believe the counterargument would be that peers can game the algorithm by spamming the blockchain with microtransactions to drive up the block size, which would squeeze out smaller miners and lead to greater centralization.

Top comment is correct:




I haven't seen anyone post an alternative to "if you want to adopt Bitcoin, you have to accept Satoshi's shares" scenario, so I'll give one here:
If you're still concerned with Satoshi owning 5% of the network, the best alternative *might* be to jump into Litecoin (probably partially, rather than wholly). If you're interested, [here's a comparative description of Litecoin vs Bitcoin]( Litecoin is the second most secure network and it's the only other network to break the $1 Billion market cap.

I don't think that's up to the IRS. It's a personal reporting preference. You just need to be consistent when you choose which one you use. If you use FIFO one year and LIFO the next, you could be putting yourself in a position to get audited for tax evasion.

I know John says a lot of crazy stuff, but I'm having a hard time getting over how disrespectful the interviewers are. At the very least I say good on John for putting up with them. That said, [Bitcoin Dominance of total crypto market cap]( *will* decrease, but it will be nowhere near 25% in 2 years. 60% at the very lowest; though I would bet it'd be closer to 70-75%.

I hear that criticism a lot (Obviously I think otherwise, but...) Augur aside, I guess my point should have been more focused on *any* proper predictions market. Didn't intend to be promoting a "ponzi"

Yeah, in part the trend I linked to above. But also the level of development I see taking place in the "alt" ecospace. If a developer likes crypto, they are limited from contributing to Bitcoin directly (IMO). The barrier to entry to making meaningful contributions is much lower in, say, Ethereum. If you log onto or most of the meaningful discussion is actually disagreement in debate (to a degree which I believe is toxic). Cue your response:


That's not to say it's not necessary dialogue - I think it's a growing pain that in the long term is beneficial (even if I don't personally appreciate being on the receiving end of it). But, by contrast, if you log into you will see discussions widely focused on growth and development and updates and roadmaps... that seems to be attractive to a lot of developers and investors - see Fred Ehrsam. 
Idealistically, I want to be a bitcoin maximalist. But, I also think it is naive to practice as one. That said, projects like Ethereum are even more experimental and have a higher likelihood of failure, but I think they at least prove there is a desire for a more diverse ecosystem, which provides a large opportunity for growth. That is all.

Self observantly, I buy a small amount every time I viscerally realize a new and subjectively significant (not just novel) application for Bitcoin. They're nothing incredibly special and I haven't had one in a while, but some examples would be:
* While trying to get money out of my closed bank on the weekend: Bitcoin doesn't close.
* When my cross country family is trying to send everyone microtransaction from the football pool: Bitcoin can do mTx.
* While seeing altcoins and appcoins develop and gain utility and liquidity: Bitcoin is and will be the reserve cryptocurrency
* While developing DApps: Bitcoin (/cryptocurrency) is the (only and) cheapest and fastest way to finance DAO, decentralized, etc economics

Hmmm... perhaps my "100% THIS" comment is a bit strong. I think OP makes sense to an extent, but it is oversimplified. I have some ideas and could speculate all day. But that's not the point here...
For the sake of argument... I think if he *has* to choose between identifying himself as either Satoshi or a charlatan, a charlatan is, sadly, the lesser of two evils.
Edit: phrasing
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:40:16
Soooo.... I'm going to play devil's advocate and suggest this may be a scam.
I've never heard of the latter domain before. And if they're the party you are "selling", ie sending, your coin to, expect that you will not be getting "skrill" back any time soon.
All the "been doing this all day" posts on here are dummy accounts. Please be careful everybody!
