Not all votes are by secret ballot. Shareholder voting in a corporation for example - so the blockchain can work well for some types of votes.

Thanks for your work with this!
The MemoryCoin community has also raised 6000MMC (~$3000) for Sean's Outpost - 
Please add a MemoryCoin donation address and I'll ask Isaac to transfer those funds to you right away.
Also, we're awarding 1% of all funds mined to charities, directly in the blockchain, and looking for new projects to support.

Yet I must confess that if I had been consulted whether to establish a Nobel Prize in economics, I should have decidedly advised against it.
One reason was that I feared that such a prize, as I believe is true of the activities of some of the great scientific foundations, would tend to accentuate the swings of scientific fashion.
This apprehension the selection committee has brilliantly refuted by awarding the prize to one whose views are as unfashionable as mine are.
I do not yet feel equally reassured concerning my second cause of apprehension.
It is that the Nobel Prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to possess.
This does not matter in the natural sciences. Here the influence exercised by an individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts; and they will soon cut him down to size if he exceeds his competence.
But the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an influence over laymen: politicians, journalists, civil servants and the public generally.
There is no reason why a man who has made a distinctive contribution to economic science should be omnicompetent on all problems of society - as the press tends to treat him till in the end he may himself be persuaded to believe.
One is even made to feel it a public duty to pronounce on problems to which one may not have devoted special attention.
I am not sure that it is desirable to strengthen the influence of a few individual economists by such a ceremonial and eye-catching recognition of achievements, perhaps of the distant past.
I am therefore almost inclined to suggest that you require from your laureates an oath of humility, a sort of hippocratic oath, never to exceed in public pronouncements the limits of their competence.

It would be really useful to see mini-charts alongside the currencies that show the variation in price against bitcoin.
That would make it a lot easier to see which coins are moving up and down on their merits, not just because all cryptocurrencies are moving.

Uh-hu. That's exactly what I don't believe.
Krugman doesn't understand the internet. Levine doesn't understand economics. Put them together - still got nothing.

He's argued that it would be a bad idea for Bitcoin to replace the USD as a national currency. He might be right, but frankly, no smart people are asking that question, so his pieces are facile.

Hayek had this to say about Krugman. Impressively said it 33 years before Krugman won his nobel.

This. It's actually true of gold too - it also became a store of value because it worked as a good payment system.

Great article. I must send Krugman a tip. Oh yeah I can't because PK hasn't joined the CryptoCurrency revolution yet.

Indeed, if Krugman's articles came with their own laughter track, it would be very helpful for us all.

I suspect he's never tried to use Paypal, or he might be more sympathetic to the cryptocurrency revolution.
