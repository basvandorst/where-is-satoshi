My point is its pointless and immature to take random IRC logs and make it seem like he doesn't understand that bitcoin has not been around for 10 years. Its not helping anyone, it doesn't bring anything new to the table, and jumping on the hate train just makes the entire community look idiotic.

The problem is that GHash.io could be hacked, the owners manipulated/forced into doing something, etc, etc, use your imagination. 
If they had the ability to perform a 51% attack, they are a major threat, even if they themselves are kind. Very few (essentially 0) companies are perfect at computer security. They potentially have a huge target on their backs.
A single point of failure is exactly what bitcoin set out to avoid.

There's been quite a bit of push for and against this symbol, with against seeming to be the most popular from what I've seen. 
Going and editing wikipedia pages to try to send people to their own site is tasteless really, especially since their goal is to sell merchandise. I doubt it will do any harm, but its still a scummy tactic.

Yea, a lot of MtGox hate is well deserved, but jumping on the "I hate Mark" bandwagon at every opportunity isn't really helping anyone. I lost a bit of cash there as well, but I'm not jumping at every opportunity to trash him.
 Not sure how I would feel about trading there again, even if they had a few high-tier places audit them, but yea. If anything, this looks like a good sign that he's taking things seriously, and wants to move forward. In my opinion, its useless unless they refund lost funds somehow, but still overall a good thing for people who'd like to believe in MtGox.

This is an excellent point. Bitcoin, by design, is built to be relatively "slow and steady". In its current implementation, I can see it being an efficient, liquid, and global store of value, but I don't see the raw protocol being used to replace cash.  High confirmation time and an exponentially increasing blockchain are real problems. 
If we stay with bitcoin, I think eventually we will have "credit cards" managed by trsuted entities that deal with everyday, small transactions. Larger transfers, or long distance transfers are still made infinetly easier with bitcoin (and that's a huge feature, imo) but scalability for small transactions is questionable. 
The idea of cryptocurrencies isn't going away though. I can't be 100% sure bitcoin is going to be the "way of the future", but I'm quite sure something like it eventually will.

You completely missed my point. I'm not passing judgement and saying "Mark is a good person", I'm saying it's childish and pointless to take everything he says and purposefully misconstrue it to make him/MtGox look as bad as possible. I'm sure he, and everyone involved, knows full well that bitcoin hasn't been around for 10 years.

Lol, obvious troll, but I'll bite. 
Successfully hacking millions of VISA transactions is an event. That event has an acceptable risk rate. Its probably quite a bit higher than bitcoin's for the same scenario. 
Because VISA relies on a huge, technically diverse infrastructure (everything from modern day servers and desktops, to really old mainframes help process credit card transactions). Keeping every single system secure is almost impossible (even assuming you have full knowledge of security vulnerabilities, which you obviously don't [See one of the many Zero-Day exploit resellers] ). 
Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a few well known, difficult to exploit vulnerabilities, and only relies on the security of crypto to remain mostly constant (and, parts of it can be swapped out, its not 100% static). 
Why don't people target VISA? I'm sure some do, but why bother when they're processing your money? Much safer to steal cards/identities and use the system VISA has set up to your advantage, rather than to fight it and risk not having a system to exploit. 
The level of "acceptable risk" we're commonly living with really isn't acceptable, it just isn't questioned nearly as much since its convenient, widespread, and "has always been like that" for a long time. 
Ok, I'm done. You can reply with more buttcoin jokes, they're occasionally funny :)

Gold is good for preserving wealth because the price doesn't fluctuate :)
I agree that Bitcoin is a superior mechanism for transferring wealth though.

I should've been clearer, it is historically much more stable and "safe" than bitcoin.

No, its a problem with Safari. Firefox notices the security issue and notifies you of it. Safari says "fuck it,  and transparently connects you.
