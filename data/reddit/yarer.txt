They won't let me deposit without verification.

Jesus, what's next? Bitcoin clash of clans?

One transaction I sent took ~2 weeks to clear, this was around the time of the august fork. I thought it got dropped or burned by the fork until it surprisingly arrived one day, but I never got my free BTCHcoins from coins in that tx.

Damn, you got me...


Now that would be a little excessive. Honestly if I were a bitcoin merchant I would be more worried about chargebacking kids than money laundering and terrorism financing.

I haven't been at the party long enough, so for a second I thought you meant [this]( bitcoin billionaire. Oops...
Giving away $13k like that is absolutely mental, especially if he knew bitcoin would moon. Does anyone have some funny crackpot conspiracy theories on why he did it?

This folks, is why you don't keep your bitcoin on exchanges. Leaving 1 to 10% of it is OK if you day trade, but only what you're actively trading not everything. Put the rest on a hardwallet or paper wallet, or at least on an offline PC.

No one can take your coins if they dont have your private keys. Best to keep some BTC.

The only selling I'll be doing if this happens is shorting

Still need transaction accelerators to get 20c (2300 sat as of now) fees through, but we're making progress.

Huge dump on bitfinex.
Knew this was going to happen, should have opened an equally huge short before it started instead of a pathetic one.
None of this will matter if bitfinex goes gox

Pity the fool who thinks counterfeit bitcoin is the real thing

"Noob friendly"
"ID verification"
Pick one. All noobs I know prefer paying 50% fees on indacoin etc. over sending their passport to internet strangers.

Was too slow to grab at 5500, but snagged some at 6k

Welcome to the party. Why not get the other 0.0062 and become a satoshi millionaire?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:14:36
I would have bought some in the 1900 dip if the exchange didn't reject my card. Maybe I should have tried harder.

What's next, taxing it?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:11:28
So true. They also need everyone in every trollbox to know their opinion.
