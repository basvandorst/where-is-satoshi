@_date: 2018-03-26 15:20:45
exactly! I have worked in it over 30 years it is just easier to say **you can't do it** rather than technically explain it to someone that won't understand anyway.

You think the Federal Reserve is responsible for a 2008? It was lack of regulations and a housing bubble that was never put under control by the government. if anything the Federal Reserve have more power the situation would have not occurred in the first place. I have noticed most people here have no clue what the Federal Reserve does and they've been watching too many Conspiracy Theory videos. They have some circle-jerk groupthink and imagine somehow without regulation the world would be a better place. I think you're all not thinking clearly and ignore all the scams, lost funds because of wallet addresses, people not keeping their keys secure, etc. cryptocurrency  might be the wave of the future but it has got a seriously a long way to come before it's ready for the General Public .

Can the bitcoin network exist without miners? no. It shows you live in a bitcoin bubble. It costs about as much electricity to run Bitcoin as Israel uses as a country.  Give that some thought. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:59:45
well the first part of research should be that to mine bitcoin... no one uses a GPU. Many alternative coins do but I will let you DYOR
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:22:54
Step  would be cryptocurrency being stable at a relative value. You are never going to get REAL adoption when you're swinging around 70% of your buying power in a few months. Get that done and you won't have to remind people why they should use it with 200 year old presidential quotes ��

I think my only gripe is its pricey in my mind to move funds out of there. On the other hand if you use there BNB token trading various currencies is pretty cheap. You can do your own research on that token but it might be worth holding a few of them for a few years. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:38:11
and what percentage of cash usage is there per household in the US?  5%-7%? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:03:57
The Federal Reserve did not say that blockchain or in your example the telephone had no value. They are talking about a specific implementation of it. so to make that equivalency [here is bitcoin](
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:25:52
Yes and nothing against Bitcoin but you can use other coins and get it near instantly. I hesitate to use Bitcoin for this exact reason. In this day and age "hours" is ridiculous.
All the Bitcoin apologist remind me of the Blockbuster people when they said, "that streaming stuff will never catch on it uses too much bandwidth".

Arbitrary numbers are arbitrary. Go read why the Federal Reserve was created in the first place and how it was so much better it was compared to previous systems. The Federal Reserve saved the American Farmer from scummy unregulated Banks. No system is perfect but totally unregulated transactions for everything are not a great idea either. People get scammed. You can see it everyday on Twitter and even Wozniak from Apple got screwed over for 7 Bitcoins and he is pretty computer savvy.

That's not what it said at all! he doesn't believe there should be 4000 coins and anybody can make a new one and it's supposedly has value. He also says Bitcoin uses too much electricity. The Federal Reserve is very positive on blockchain technology

So you understand that prices are easily manipulated by "whales" and don't have a problem with that. Awesome. Not sure I see a difference from using a bank... Other than it cost a fuck ton of electricity that to make a transaction.
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:13:08
It differs with how much money you make but are you familiar with capital gains? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:19:14
There are a bunch of **super** technical people at the Federal Reserve You have no idea what you're talking about. Most people that work there are absolutely not bankers. I have worked there over 15 years and I have never worked in a bank previously in my life. I'm not one of the super technical but I'm no banker.

The way things are going... wait a few weeks and you might be able to buy  a whole 1 BTC for a thousand bucks ��
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:51:17
Bitcoin? yeah NO.  it will use more electricity than it will generate by 10-100 fold.  You can CPU mine Zcoin, Monero, Garlic, and a bunch of others but honestly in this market you are looking at .01-.02 cents an hour.   
   
Download this exe and run some benchmarks      
what .exe you use will depend on what CPU you have. i.e. RTFM

Better... but still pricey IMO there are lots of better options depending where you are going.

actually many banks including the Federal Reserve think [blockchain is the future]( They just think bitcoin is of shit implementation of it.

I was in my twenties and couldn't afford it. I certainly wasn't going to live with my parents so I joined the military. I believe that option is still open to most.

And you think that's good? 1.8% to send $1 and it takes 16 minutes!  Bitcoin if the slowest way to go. I only use it if I have to. I would much prefer almost anything else... even DOGE is faster. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:40:32
I bet it IS!  I have a test wallet that I just recovered using Eden yesterday. The first thing it made me do after it saw I had funds in it is a backup. It then sent me an e-mail and I thought to myself I'll have to be sure not to delete that. &lt;doh&gt; I never even thought about it. I will be moving that to an encrypted Drive ASAP.

Ah cool thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:23:57
and why exactly do you think bitcoin or any other crypto currency has value? it's because people believe it does. Other than rarity gold has no value unless you want to have solid electrical connections or have shiny jewelry. People covet it because it's rare. If I had magic machine that could generate gold bars or bitcoins both of become worthless overnight.  The idea that the Federal Reserve arbitrarily prints money is nonsense. The idea that we could return to the gold standard is ludicrous.

Because Bitcoin people like to believe it's not true but... the reality is 4 to 5% Bitcoin holders own 90 to 96% of Bitcoin.

So not paying your taxes? When you're a business you have business taxes you need to pay. There's also a fee to do business with a business license. You're splitting hairs.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:53:22
well true... but that is not "replacing banking in the very near future" like a lot of the pie-in-the-sky people like to groupthink around here. Crypto has a LONG way to go before that.

Zcoin has this problem right now. Something like +80% of mining is done on MPH. How is that not centralized?
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:14:44
Band together? The Federal Reserve alone moves $93 trillion a day. Meaning they could buy and sell the whole market, of all coins in existence, over 180 times... a day. Get a grip.

Well you can't mine Bitcoins with graphics cards or CPUs. If you mine altcoins you are looking at 3 to $5 a day per card. I'll let you do the math on your ROI. They make specialty motherboards that are designed to hold up to 13 graphics cards. I suggest you do a fuck ton of research before you drop 30k. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:24:56
lol no I think of Bitcoin like I do Blockbuster. They were very popular and made tons of money for a long time and then... something new and better came along and they cease to exist.

You **can't** mine bitcoin with your phone, you **can't** mine with a regular computer, you **can't** mine with a computer GPU. You need a specialized  ASIC computer to effectively mine bitcoin.  I would suggest you go read some more.

I think they would be more concerned about who's running the country right now. how the voting system doesn't it work as intended and how voters are manipulated by gerrymandering districts.  Also how third parties have zero chance of winning due to the sheer amount of money in politics and that corporations are allowed to "buy off" politicians that was somehow deemed legal by the Supreme Court. Bitcoin is a drop in the sea of fucked up.
