2 week old account that posts nothing but negative bitcoin comments in bitcoin you say?

They're local, haven't used it personally.  
Since they are local, I do occasionally now see a RHD car about every other day as opposed to never.  They had a Master Ace Surf van that was hideous, in an awesome way.  Kinda wanted that for a camping van.

I'll just plunk this here:
All legal for US road use.  Yay.

BitInstant; Moneygram -&gt; Generated deposit address, wait 5 minutes, bam, BTC doled to address of choice.  
Honestly, worked great.

There was a guy at work that would wear headphones when taking a piss, and be singing love songs.  
It's awkward when you're taking a shit, and 6 feet away is a guy handling his schlong singing about how he's gonna make love to you.

My brother once gave me the same advice about an obvious pump and dump on a penny stock.  Knew it was the case, but figured I could ride the wave and cash out early.  He advised against it, with the very same gambling statement.
I watched it go from 2-5 cent to 1.20 (probably would have jumped ship at 50-75 cent honestly).  A few weeks after, in a phone call, he thanked me for the advice and noted he made 5K off it.

Coinbase delay from 11-16K peak day, those funds were available today.  I'd imagine some folks wanted to realize their 3-10% gain in a week.

If your order wasn't triggered, you should have no problem canceling it.  Screenshot of your order page?

I have dreams of putting buy orders in for 100 BTC @ 0USD and someone fat fingering their sell.

Something to consider:
What you're seeing today is the result of all the coinbase delayed deposits hitting from what, last week?  So, if one invested 25,000 and realized a 4% gain in a week, they could be taking that out...if I had to speculate.
I mean, there's 1M a few dollars north of current pricing waiting to sell.  40,000 in a week ain't bad.

They're great on a track, the suspension is...firm.  Most average streets feel like a beating after a few hours.  Road trips are rough.  :o
