Please dont say you will take out your crystal ball. Just hoping to get a feel of the expectations.

 I stay in an average area , fair amount of drugs , average people , staying in flats. People dont know much about bitcoin here, tell someone you putting 4 k in rands into bitcoin they will tell you its such a huge risk. 4k is one months rental. Tell them the 4 k will grow 100% etc peoples eyes light up and put money they cant afford to lose. Its just viewed as unnecessary headache as it wont be applied everywhere. Of course more developed and elite areas may welcome this idea.However for the vast majority are just in a bad space. Every week I see beggars picking food from the bins, its thats just the state we really in, just giving him some food will brighten up his day. Though yeah elite areas, fancy places, you could implement such an idea however for most areas, highly unlikely.

Watch the price,  its been falling. Not sure when the drop will end though

Im new but I agree with this if you have less money and cant even afford a whole coin.
Ive put half my money in bitcoin no doubt but the % is not going to be huge. I've put roughly 20% in lite dash neo monero however the 30% I put in coins trading at around a dollar eg vertcoin , trading 0,x $ like ripple , $0.0x like cardano.. im a long term holder and student hence I have to hope and trust atleast something goes big, eg if 1 day I get up and cardano is 3$ my money multiplied by 100 and I would own multiple coins whereas in bit coin I merely own a tiny bit.
