Apple is not the first in a lots of things, they need to see if crypto is actually works in real life, of course it will but these big companies are waiting for smaller, more innovative conpanies to test the water,  all this takes time. Apple will accept crypto when they see that people are using it somewhere else (Samsung could give them a quick start��)

You should try places where young people go: universities, discoteques, etc, it also gives u more xposure than a small shop or restaurant

Great news, I will try it out this weekend. Although i was hoping that its the 2nd BTM in Antwerp, but I see this is the same machine which was at the Caffeelab. We need more in Belgium!

Well in Hungary they banned Uber already, just when it started to get popular, (taxi companies pressed the government to make new laws that Uber could not fulfill), I am thinking Airbnb next. They are on it now. But if not, -like this article prooves- they will regulate it and people must pay taxes when they rent out their flat becouse they make income. Bit logical. Now even if they receive their payment in BTC they will tax that anyhow.

Was just in today's news in Hungary that the tax regulators there was asking airbnb in Ireland to provide all info about the Hungarians renting out their places. Ireland sent all info, now they are checking who paid correctly their taxes, and most of them  -who did not- will be fined big time. airbnb is not anonym, dont think they will use bitcoin...same for uber

She only invested 20 bucks, i dont know why, i guess becouse it was all over the news and she wanted to be part of it ?! So i bought it for her, niw she is down :)))

Same  as you would  buy gold

Can somebody explain why the price of Bitcoin is dropping like this?   
The  technology is the same, it was not hacked, its safe, its like gold...so whats wrong?   
Is it because of the stupid Bcash fork? Who cares?   
Or is it because people who invested last year (including my 80 year old mother-in-law)   
in December lost faith seeing the prices go down, and turned away from crypto and blockchain?  
Or is it because I can not go down to the supermarket and buy milk, bread and wine with Bitcoin? Or even pay my bills? (it is actually not good for anything in real life, yet)  
Or it is because the big companies, banks, organisations are afraid to step in, because it is too volatile?   
Well, I think I just answered all my questions, but thanks for reading it this far,   
here is a smiley for you.....because we will go up sooner than you think....I don't see any reason not to  ��

Where is it? Is that on Váci street?
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:45:10
Ok,  but  how is it decentralised then....should not we be free from all these Rogers and Craigs?  
We (the technology) must be more 'stable' and not let 2 people affect things like this.....that is the original idea, I think.
@_date: 2018-11-07 10:19:08
Yea but what went down eventually must also come up
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:47:12
....so whats next Trump steps in and turns off blockchain? And price goes to 0?
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:21:32
you are absolutely right, there are usually more reason to sell (pay the bills, buy stuff) then reasons to hold (i am in for the technology etc)...what i find funny is that people really like sheeps, if it starts to go one direction all goes that way, its so funny....we need a Puli maybe to chase people around :)

@_date: 2018-12-16 07:38:29
Agreed. And with that they also f*cked up the reputation of crypto, those two idiots with their powerplay did more harm than good. They will go down in history big time.

Interesting read, thanks
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:22:28
don't get it either...all good news about blockchain adaption...etc...still price is falling...i I am thinking that it is all because of that stupid Australian satoshi guy...is he doing this? Just to prove his point to make his coin big? how can he bring the price down if all this its decentralised...?
