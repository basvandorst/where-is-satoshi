OK, but you don't have to be comfortable with Greek letters :)  µ is just part of the etymology of uBit.

But people don't use them.  In reality it's not intuitive to talk in decicents or microdollars.  We use the units we are used to.

(Not meaning to endorse any of the rudeness in this thread)
If you go onto the streets of the UK and ask what portion a micro-unit of something is, and what the SI symbol associated with it, you're not going to get correct answers.
If you show some other UK people the µ symbol, and ask how you would pronounce µAcres, and ask what proportion of an acre it would be, you're not going to get correct answers.
Nonetheless, I recommend adopting the **uBit** ("you bit") unit as one micro-Bitcoin.  That removes ambiguity as to what it actually is, while not confusing people who don't know what or how much µ is.
The intention is to use it for most prices below 1 BTC.
Example: Buy this vacuum cleaner for uB 320K

GHash were not doing a good job if they were over 40%, which they were.
This has happened before, and GHash hasn't really done anything to stop it.
Why aren't we hearing about how GHash are willing to sign an agreement with all other biggish pools, that no-one will go over 33% or face financial penalties?  Why aren't they raising fees?  They just don't seem to care.

People don't know many micrograms are in a gram.  But the microgram unit could be useful in comparing the quantities of ingredients in various drugs I suppose.
Most people have never built a PC.  Of those who have built PCs, the vast majority will not know what portion of a metre a nanometre is.  And they wouldn't have to know.

Most people don't even know what the 'micro' prefix is (µ).
And people have trouble with orders of magnitude.  People have trouble with very large and very small numbers.  People aren't going to know how many µBTC are in an mBTC.  Is it a thousand?  A hundred?
Suggest using **uBit** in place of µBTC, but using uBit for most sub-Bitcoin prices, for easier adoption.  Buy a coffee maker for uB 150K, that kind of thing.
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:22:10
Use µBitcoins, and call them uBits.  People can deal with two decimal places when it's time to do that, and so can currency trading software.
As for Bitcoins (the unit), they are useful and aren't going away.  And they're already called 'bit' by many people, especially in East Asia.

Are you an Anarchist?  I thought that Anarchists were OK with some collectivism and are not against rules.  Like when a housing association requires you to keep your lawn mowed, that's OK because it's not the government's doing, it's an agreement between private individuals.
Anyway, what rules are we making here in that you object to?


Bitcoin is what the people say is Bitcoin.  This is considered to be an improvement over the old model.

'Microbitcoin' is a long word.  'Bitcoin' is already four syllables in Japanese and Korean.
Let's call them uBits.  Koreans can call them 유비 (you-bee) for short.

'bits', no.  'uBits', OK.

Good on them for considering the network as a whole rather than damaging it by shortsightedly focusing on their own immediate interests.

Nah, it'll be 'bitties', to rhyme with 'titties'.

No, people understand it because it is physical units that they are used to.
People know how many millimetres in a centimetre, but ask how many mm in a metre, and they'll have to think for a while.  Ask how many micrometres in a metre and they'll have no idea.
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:10:02
So, the ad was on Google.  Why else might Google be to blame?

Great initiative.  Seems we need more Bitcoin nodes in South Korea, according to this:

It won't matter that he got booed.  If he gets arrested the day after the conference, the media will report that he was a Bitcoin entrepreneur who was in town to give the keynote speech at an important Bitcoin conference.

What makes you think they had tens of thousand of Bitcoins?

But it wouldn't be twice as likely with a 5-minute block time than with a 10-minute block time, would it?


But it isn't really the hashing power that makes it secure, is it?

What about uBits?  A uBit is a µBitcoin!

Unlike fiat, which is perfectly fine and safe, even though fiat currencies keep failing, and the government can just inflate away your money any day.

How would they know to do that?
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:16:01
uBits ("you-bits") is 2, and isn't something that people already call Bitcoins, and isn't already used to talk about data transfer rate, file size, or encryption strength.
It is also less confusing to attach the word 'coin' to, for physical coins.

If it was Microsoft, Google, and the NSA who were paying core devs, and they had done important work, but wanted to change the direction of the bitcoin project against popular consensus, would that be an issue?
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:23:39
So inflation is bad.  Bitcoin doesn't need to have a block reward as high as it does, at the moment.  We don't want miners producing empty blocks.  But getting political agreement to change the reward rate would be tricky.
