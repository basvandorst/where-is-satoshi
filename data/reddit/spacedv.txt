Here we have an example of the sexism that is rampant in the community. Want more women involved? Change your attitude(s). (This is coming from a man who doesn't by any means identify as a feminist, and rarely is bothered by sexism, save for a few places on the internet.)
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:36:24


And what reason is that exactly? Biological differences between men's and women's brains could probably explain a statistical difference of some size, but the actual difference is way too big to be explained by that alone - simply because there is so much variation *within* the sexes as well, that the average difference between them isn't exactly huge in comparison.

Sadly, there is no such thing as "just a joke". Even a joke tells something - or in some cases a lot - about how the person who told it thinks and views the world, and likewise for its reception and the audience. Humor does not exist as some kind of a parallel reality that is in no causal relation to actual reality. Sexist and racist jokes are often defended by them being "just funny". It's good to stop to think *why* do people find them funnier than the less mean ones.

If the miners go with 2x (still not certain), that means they think the fork will be good for Bitcoin adoption. If the miners are too stupid to act in their own financial self interest, then Bitcoin is truly hopeless.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:09:37


And that's the problem. There's no indication whatsoever that it will be. Why are you people so irrationally afraid of hard forks? If an exchange wants to offer trading of coins in an obsolete chain after a clearly advantageous protocol upgrade, then let it destroy its business. Ethereum's DAO HF was different, because it wasn't a technical upgrade.

Without any explanation where those numbers come from, I assume it's just segwit + EC signaling percentages added up, which produces almost exactly that number currently.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:52:50
I think he means that your goal must be to damage Bitcoin, if you a) imply twitter polls have any meaning here, and/or b) claim that BIP148 with only minority support is somehow better than 2MB + segwit HF. The former is actually a highly contentious HF, and anyone-can-spend can actually really be spent by miners unless a majority of them has switched to segwit (they are safe if hashing power is behind segwit as in LTC).
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:35:56
But you can afford transaction fees of over $2? 1MB Bitcoin is the Bitcoin for rich people only.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:10:59
I don't think virtually any of the actual, real Bitcoin users (both end-users and businesses) mind segwit + 2mb HF. They just aren't shouting about it as loudly and actively on reddit and twitter as the extremists on both sides.
P.S. There is no "this community" anymore, everyone should know this. Most of the real community doesn't have any sensible place to discuss Bitcoin these days.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:56:24
Let's be honest: If it was functioning as a currency, merchants would directly take BTC and pay a part of their expenses with it. Since they mostly just get cash from BitPay, it's currently a payment &amp; money transfer system and a store of value, but not really a currency, since it doesn't truly circulate. But hopefully it will get there some day.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:49:55

Just "no"? How come the guy is so sure lol. I find it a bit weird that everyone is absolutely certain that Bitcoin is not going to be big, but some other cryptocoin based on it will. They never give any good reasons.

I withdrew an amount of LTC worth over 5 BTC and it worked. I would go easier on the FUD spreading. They probably have a huge amount of increased traffic with people going crazy over altcoins.

I think it will fall lower, it just takes a few days or even weeks. There will be optimists buying on the way down, thinking the momentum will turn any moment.
I don't think the falling has much to do with gox at this point, it's just that most people see the downward trend and think it will go on, so they sell. Just like they bought irrationally while the daily trend was upwards.
In fact, if you are afraid of Mt. Gox losing your money or keeping it to themselves, it's probably better to withdraw it as coins rather than fiat, as there must be a huge amount of people requesting withdrawals right now.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:15:38
That might be confusing for many people since bit is also a unit of information and you need many bits to represent a satoshi.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:10:55
The problem may be as simple as someone having mined directly to their BTC deposit address on BTC-E, making the coins unspendable for a while. Or just something to do with moving coins from hot-wallet to cold-storage etc. Gox has had these issues for a long time but to my knowledge they have all been resolved in a few hours or a couple of days at most.
Plenty of technical reasons why it can affect BTC but not other coins. If they had ran away with people's coins, I imagine they would have taken LTC too. I would guess the total value of LTC on BTC-E doesn't fall much behind of the value of BTC there.
But I guess some paranoia is understandable.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:36:01
Decentralized cryptocurrencies will prevail long term. But the current prices are probably not sustainable if Chinese buyers are out.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:33:42
Well, presumably you could get coins any time easily from an exchange service or even an ATM. When you think about it, BTC can be even more liquid than fiat. If it really went mainstream, we would have very fast and efficient ways to buy it, for example ATMs or some kind of mobile services. The business that you buy something from can use a service like BitPay, which would mean the coins are almost *instantly* back in an exchange. Or they can send them to their deposit address on an exchange at whatever intervals they want. Thus the coins can actually move very fast from exchange to customer, customer to merchant and merchant to exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:28:17
Yes, even 1.1% might be too low. But it would definitely have a psychological effect, and speculation is all human psychology. In addition, you could have many similar block chains if the deflation gets out of hand, so better err on the smaller side maybe.

I felt very much like that in April before the crash, but I can tell you it was just greed and it made me do some bad trades and of course miss the top.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:54:18
You are making the assumption that no more than exactly the amount equaling the whole supply of BTC can change hands in a year. That's false. for example 21 million people could buy 1 BTC each in January from some exchange, then use them to buy (expensive) alpaca socks for 1 BTC. The alpaca sock retailer would then send the 1 BTC to an exchange. This process could be repeated for every month of the year, meaning that 252 [edit: stupid error] million BTC moved in that year. That's just a silly oversimplified example, but you get the picture.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:00:14
Sorry mate, I meant the paper where that $1300 is taken from:  It seems pretty objective and not overly pessmistic (but not optimistic either) and the calculations seem fine. I think everyone who holds a lot of BTC should read it and think whether to trust Winklewoss' figure of tens of thousands of dollars that they pulled out of their a$$. (It's possible we'll get to that level of adoption to warrant a price that high, but I wouldn't say it's very likely at that point.)
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:26:31
That is the best post in this thread and the most accurate description of CoinValidation I've seen so far. It's about the existing laws (that are crap, yes) and the US gov is going go as far as necessary to enforce those laws. One way or the other.

Greed, fear and stress can make people stupid and delusional. I lost more than a half of my dollar worth but I'm actually happier and calmer now than before the crash. EDIT: Didn't take a loss on my original investment though and it was an amount I could afford to lose.

There was a pretty big run up in the Chinese exchanges, they said that OKcoin is taking deposits again in BTC-e trollbox (yes, be extremely critical of this information) and gave this as a source: 
I honestly don't know what to think. Is everyone in China just as confused as us or are they trolling everyone?
EDIT: Probably a hoax, considering that the price in OKcoin totally tanked again!

@_date: 2013-12-18 14:06:48
I understand all that. Bitcoin's volatility might never decrease to acceptable levels, it's far from certain. The fixed supply and usage as store of value mean that there is basically no upper limit for the price of one BTC in theory, so speculative spikes might never end. This is why I actually think coins with some monetary inflation, like Argentum (1.1% a year after all the base supply is mined) are promising.
The comparison to the housing market bubble just was kind of flawed and I misunderstood your original comment.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:51:54
There is no national currency that is 100 or 1000 times as big per unit as a dollar, is there? You were just giving examples of currencies with very small units there. Yeah, people don't have so much problems with them and they probably wouldn't with units that are millionth of a BTC either. In addition, it would weird and annoying to count zeroes from prices of everyday stuff if BTC goes mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:03:11
Given how easy and fast it is to move coins around and sell them, I think the whole Bitcoin economy could easily run with BTC being valued at $5. The price would be volatile as fuck without any speculation (if that was somehow possible), however.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:33:39
The difference is that banks didn't let anyone buy bitcoins with 99% leverage, pack the loans to new financial products and sell them to other banks, who would have proceeded to make new financial products out of them and sell them to other leveraged buyers. If it gets even near that point, THEN bitcoin is fucked.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:12:29

Good comment there. The pushing efforts can backfire when customers and business managers start saying "we tried that bitcoin thing, but it didn't work very well" and businesses stop accepting it. It will be hard to convince them to start taking it again, if they have already had a negative experience.
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:48:47
I'm not sure I understand how exactly BDD is calculated. Let's say I have 10 BTC that are associated with public address X that ~~hasn't received any BTC in 100 days~~ were put there 100 days ago and before it was empty. If I moved all of them out of there, that would increase BDD by 100 * 10. But what I'm not sure about is what happens if I first send 1 BTC more to X and then immediately afterwards spend the 11 coins there. Is the result 100 * 10 + 0 * 1 = 1000 or is it 0 * 11 = 0? If it's the former, what happens if I spend only 1? Is it calculated to come from the "older coins" or the "new coins" first?
What I'm trying to figure out is if it's possible that some of these "old coins" are coins leaving exchanges or if they are going on exchanges and traded over-the-counter. (Can't think of much other reasons for the surge.)
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:37:41
I completely agree with you. I still sympathize with those idiots and hope they are ok.  
Idiots who are planning to kill yourself: leave at least a part of your coins in a safe place, don't sell all of them. Then go meditate for a year in the Himalayas or something.

Exactly. There's also this:
"CoinDesk has since spoken to Bobby Lee again, who  clarified that all payments from banks require third party processor involvement, and that Internet payments from banks had been possible until his relationship with TenPay and subsequently YeePay were severed. Without these relationships, it was unable to process RMB payments into its customers’ accounts."
So no direct bank transfers!

I think that's a very good point. Governments are spending massive amounts of resources - more than ever - on surveillance and many are even considering breaking the internet (SOPA, PIPA etc.) just to enforce copyrights on strings of bits. Does anyone realistically think there is any way they are going to leave such a handy way to launder money and move it anonymously (passing it through coinjoin or some other mixer) alone? I'm afraid that either they are going to outlaw it or require a tracking mechanism like CoinValidation and consider every user guilty until proven innocent. That would mean no mixing or your coins are "dirty".
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:17:30
Sucks. :(
I wouldn't blame MtGox though, same could have probably happened with any other exchange when not using 2FA. MtGox has actually done a pretty good job with 2FA support, mailing Yubikeys for free earlier and everything.

Thanks for the post. I was pretty skeptical of all the talk about China adopting BTC in here and you confirmed my suspicions.
If the Chinese government thinks it would be useful to stop Chinese people trading BTC, they can easily do so. It's an authoritarian government and they do whatever they want. They are known to not be bothered by trivialities like human rights, as long as a huge amount of people won't become very pissed. The BTC community there is apparently small enough that they can still afford to do anything with them without causing significant unrest.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:21:19

Seems we are getting a chart perfect with the dead cat bounce (right after the big fall) and a bull a bull trap (starting from the dip that happened when gox started trading again, and still going on).
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:12:49
It's actually the opposite; if people really were trying to buy low and sell high, the price would be much more stable. That's because in order to succeed with that you have to do the trades *before* the tops and bottoms or else you'll probably be late. The competition would make people sell and buy back in earlier and earlier.
The problem is people buying at *any price* greedily, hoping to become rich after holding the coins for a while.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:07:34
People were saying that before both the 2011 and the April crash. Guess what? These "everybody" didn't have enough money to keep the price from falling greatly. I'm not sure the price is that high yet, but at this rate it will soon be.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:15:43
Satoshi should be the name of the new base unit. No matter what decimal place it will represent.
The argument that normal people would be okay with using the SI multipliers as in µBTC, because they are okay with kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes is flawed for two reasons. First, those units actually *are* confusing for a lot of people. Second, people seem to find multipliers that are smaller than one a bit weird and they are less familiar with their names (milli, micro etc) than with the larger-than-one ones.
10^-6 BTC might be the best size for the new base unit in the in long run, it wouldn't realistically ever get too ~~small~~ big. What matters less is whether the conversion rate to BTC is a nice multiple of 10^-3 what some people argue for. I think the whole point is to adopt a new base unit in place of BTC which is ridiculously large now. Just like people living in the EU don't need to care about the conversion rate of euros to their old national currency units, almost nobody would need to care about the conversion rate from the new unit to BTC after a while.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:00:22
Not necessarily. As the flow of coins both in and out of the exchanges would probably fluctuate by some amount, the price would too, without anyone doing any speculative or day trading. I might be wrong but I'm guessing we might see up to 50 cent variations at 5$ on a daily or weekly basis and that would be as bad as going from 200$ to 180$ or 220$ for businesses accepting payment in BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:00:08
Some threats I've thought about:
* Scaling issues. The network can currently process something like 7 transactions per second, if I recall correctly. That number would need to be several orders of magnitude higher.
* People might not consider the benefits of using BTC instead of fiat worth the trouble of converting their fiat to BTC first. Hopefully buying BTC becomes easier and receiving wages and other payments in it becomes more commonplace. Otherwise this might be a problem.
* Governments like to have control over people and their activities. Bitcoin is hard to control so governments and central banks might feel threatened by it, afraid to lose power. If many powerful governments and/or "big money" agree to a joint effort to take bitcoin down, that will be it.
* The community might be unable to reach a decision on some important things. For example, it would be good for mainstream adoption to switch to a smaller base unit like µBTC, but it will do no good if some services switch to use mBTC while others µBTC or Satoshis and some continue with BTC. On the contrary, that would just serve to make bitcoin even more confusing. There will probably be many much more important technical issues as well.
* The community might get divided and fragmented over issues like CoinValidation. A lot of the current bitcoin owners and users might switch to different altcoins - each with a small user base of their own - that work best for them and their ideals. If nothing else, this would greatly help governments with seizing control over Bitcoin.
* And of course there might be a new altcoin that will either be technically superior or easier to manipulate and thus winning acceptance of governments and central banks.
I'm still optimistic though and a lot of my money is in BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:33:58
I suppose most people don't need to really understand it once they start to see it as just money - if we get to that point some day. I mean fairly few people understand well how banks or the economy in general works or what the numbers in your bank account really represent. But they know what they can do with money.
The fluctuation has been decreasing for the whole lifetime of bitcoin up to this point. Of course there have been and will be both more and less stable periods, but decreasing volatility is still the general trend. And there are many good theoretical reasons for that so I expect it to continue.
The rest of the problems you point out could be solved by application level services/software and added support by existing services. I bet people are working on these things even as I type this, there is a lot of potential money to be made. But we'll see.
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:50:35
That's terrible and people are going to cite it as "proof" that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:39:29
"Cryptowar"? The stupidest thing to do would be bitcoiners and litecoiners starting bashing each other publicly and DDoS:ing each other's exchanges and other services. Wait.. the former has already started. That's not going to help with positive media attention.
Yes, Litecoin doesn't bring any significant improvement on the table. But their devs and other supporters might be better at marketing and image crafting and that's why they are gaining support. That's just a part of capitalism, that we all are so fond of.
There will probably always be multiple cryptocoins and people will flock to other alternatives if  the most popular coins have deflated madly. And that's good, it'll prevent potential deflationary spirals (which might be a thing or might not, no one knows).
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:33:12
You might be right! And I really like "credits" actually.

That's an argument for the price being sustainable? It basically means that the current price is based on the assumption that 2/3 of coins in existence won't be sold. It just adds to the uncertainty of the price.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:43:49
I'm saying that when the subprime crisis happened, it was clear that was the end. There was no way things could go back to the way they were, simply because the money never was there and never could there be enough money. With bitcoin, it's not clear this is the end at all. There is still interest and there is still loads and loads of money that could go in and nothing has changed the long term prospects. If the crash continues, we'll get to a level even the Bank of America Merril Lynch might consider BTC underpriced.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:28:37
The market is simply trying to figure out a value for BTC that is lower than the expectancy value by some margin (probably dependent on the variance). Obviously different people have wildly different estimates. The price will slowly even out and rises and dips will become relatively smaller. If the new floor is going to be above 100$, this amount of volatility is nothing compared to 2011.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:12:34
I'm not an economist, but it has crossed my mind that might be best, yes. But to my knowledge, there isn't enough proof that those problems of deflation even exist. Bitcoin is going to either prove or disprove those theories and it's exciting to watch how it turns out.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:16:10
Yes. And that's why trying to boost short term investors' confidence in the price isn't needed, is it. And no need to downvote bad news (for the current price and rate of adoption) or posts and comments that say a crash or downward correction is coming, right? It doesn't help with your goal to feed irrational exuberance, as is done all the time in this sub, because we don't want to the price to overshoot the current fundamentals and crashing heavily as a result.

I'm sure Bobby Lee understands the situation better than anyone, save for some people who actually work for the Chinese government. In fact, if he hadn't been sure, he wouldn't have said anything else than advised against using it for now to avoid getting in trouble if it becomes clear it's prohibited. On the other hand, Chinese people know better than to spread false information about their government, or even correct information if it can be interpreted as criticizing.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:44:50
This is bigger than the geeks here realize. Now ordinary people and the mainstream media will perhaps finally understand the divisibility of bitcoins.

I know this won't probably happen, but I think governments should switch to taxing non-renewable and slowly renewing resources and commercial activities that exploit nature (e.g. letting harmful chemicals into waters) and nothing else. Given the nature of the (real world) mining industry and energy production for example, it would be pretty hard to hide from the taxman, even if your company takes BTC as payment. Well it would make all kinds of sense anyway I think.
The costs of the the taxation would end up being paid by pretty much everyone of course. And thats part of the point; no use to have such a complicated system when you can just tax the natural sources and let the costs propagate through the economy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:52:17

Yes, the new unit definitely needs a distinct name and "Credit" is perfect! Then we could also use kilo-Credits (kCr?) as long as price of BTC is close to $1000. With µBTC that would be really weird.
