Yeah they are having problems sending/receiving BTC. I sent btc from one wallet, to my coinbase account last night, and the transaction has 180 confirmations, yet in Coinbase it still says "Pending"

My transaction still says pending after 23 hours, every since their "UPDATE" many users have been experiencing the same thing. I have two transactions I sent almost a day ago that have been confirmed over 100 times each and they still say pending on coinbase. Their support is so shit, I don't expect my coin anytime soon.

Yeah ive been done with coinbase for about a two weeks now and it feels great.

I'm not sure but I know coinbase is having MAJOR issues for many people. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:50:18
Because the quickest transactions right now are paying over 600 per byte I believe

I'm in a different situation, I sent money from an external wallet to my coinbase wallet. it has 180+ Confirmations and it still says pending deposit 36 hours later.

my transaction still says PENDING, it has been about 36 hours

Coinbase is legit garbage.  Sometimes they take hours to even send your coin.  I would just wait a few more hours, and submit a ticket in the mean time.  But their website is just fucking trash.

Coinbase takes time to send your btc sometimes, coinbase is having major problems this past week. Be patient it should send within a couple hours.

Fuck coinbase.

Fuck PayPal and their shitty comments. They want control of your money, that is why the hate crypto

So what do u suggest I do to speed up the process
@_date: 2016-06-15 13:19:53
Ok thank you. Is there anyway to estimate how long it is going to take ?

Coinbase's support is HORRIBLE. It makes them worse than a bank. Back in October I submitted 3 different tickets for issues I was having, I recently got replies in March saying , sorry for the late reply.... It's been fucking months. I don't trust coinbase at all because their support is the worst in crypto.

I just started using cash app to buy BTC, it has been fantastic so far, give it a try
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:25:21
I recently found out you can buy BTC through the "cash app" it's very easy and low fees
