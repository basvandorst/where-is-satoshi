How can people adopt it if it has transaction fees of 20$ and takes hours to confirm? 
Forks are only happening because there isn't a clear working  roadmap for scaling issues. 
This would all be solved if all groups agreed on a block increase consensus.

So hard-fork for block increase is bad, but hard-fork for PoW change (which is only caused by the former) is not. Logics...

Increase block size....

Great questions!

Well, i'm relatively new here but i've been reading a lot about both sides in the last few weeks.
Basically, there are 2 main arguments that core supporters use:
1. decentralization
2. hard fork are dangerous
From what i've seen both have been debunked. Here is why:
1. Hardware and network capabilities have grown a lot since 2010 (when 1MB limit was implemented). Therefore the limit is outdated and will not really affect centralisation of nodes. Also, keeping a large value network has a cost and we cannot expect to continue to have the whole Bitcoin blockchain running only on small disks forever. 
2. Hard forks have proven to be successful if enough consensus is achieved. Therefore if more than 95% are in favour of block size increase, the need to hard fork is not a real problem. Also, you have to compare the challenge of an hard fork upgrade with the network congestion and high fees we are seeing right now. Which one is better?
Also, other things to consider about this arguments...
The Core supporters are supposedly about decentralization but currently there is a lot of centralization on the developer side and scaling roadmap (Core).
Also, about the hard-fork, they seem to be against it but there seem to be talkings about a PoW change hard-fork which would go directly against this.
So IMO i don't really see any plausible rational justification for not modestly increase block size in a way that doesn't risk the network. For me the best way would be to plan a roadmap for block increase for the next 5 years, and everybody would be happy again. Also, a lot of mining power going to altcoins could come back again for the bitcoin blockchain.

Interesting quote from Satoshi himself, in the times we live in...
"It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one.  Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this.  We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.  The CPU power proof-of-work vote must have the final say.  The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what."
