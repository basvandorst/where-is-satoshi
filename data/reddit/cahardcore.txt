Already got those .... come get sum :)

Sorry... lol... ask a stupid question get a stupid answer.
It’s not predictable my man. If you believe that the tech is here to stay (I do) and that because of that it will increase in value (I do) then get in now , prep for up and downs and hope that it settles above where you bought in ( which i am a believer that it will be well above the current price )

They let 15 year olds sign up on that exchange??? I always figured that the submission of a government ID was to make sure you were at least 18.

I don’t know about that... when I was in college i didn’t have any money to invest in that wasn’t for pizza, beer and trying to get chicks. Don’t have any friends that did either! Maybe I was in the wrong crowd , but we all turned out pretty darn okay....
Can’t image that much has changed and that the spring break party bus is gonna dent anything.
For the college kids that DO have money/smarts to invest, doubt those are the types to cash out for spring break

A store of value that is not centralized 
Most of these alt coins... its crypto currency but your buying them from some company , they “made” it and you paid them for it. With bitcoin you’re not buying from someone, you pay an exchange fee, but you’re getting a piece of the 21 million bitcoins that operate on the block chain which is not centralized and is a ledger of value. 
If you “buy” the new “super alt coin” you actually sent money to some guy who in turn gave you some of that coin, hence now your money is in that guys possession which is a central location

Is transferring off An exchange (gdax) to Trezor wallet as slow and fucked up as the other transactions?
Hodl’ing and want to get it into the trezor but a little apprehensive about the current slow /expensive/problematic transactions 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:04:38
Do you believe in the value of Bitcoin as a decentralized store of value ?? OR are you dreaming of lambos earned off easy crypto??
If it’s the latter go for alts, buy lottery tickets , play at the casino . Or, buy BTC and HODL
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:11:01
How did you buy at 19k and are still in profit ?
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:02:30
Exactly 86 Hours from right ...... now!
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:10:38
Lol... thanks.
Put my search terms in google and will likely end up on reddit !!
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:44:00
supply and demand. There is a limited supply of BTC and as we can see serious demand .. hence it is worth something!!!!!  It has value!!! Your three “proofs” do nothing to nullify the very most basic economic principle driving this. When all 21mil have been mined and the price has settled at say 50k, you want to be on the side lines because of your super smart 3 proofs? Or in the game because of my super basic Econ 101

We just tuck the devil horns beneath the little round cloth hat first
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:12:04
Some wallets you can set a “below “ alert so you can be notified when the price dips to the point you want  to reinvest.... I’m HODL, but add small amounts (for me) at dips

Look at the fees as a % not a $ number and they are more than you think .. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:56:15
Forcing you to not make an emotional decision!
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:20:46
Set an amount that you are willing to potentially lose in crypto .... 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:00:29
Good thing people opinions on reddit are just that
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:34:35
Bought the dip 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:07:08
I’ve always found asking about $ is rude.... even my best pal from kids is a big shot at a tech company that rhymes at Snapple.... I could ask, I could Probably find out, but why? To measure myself against him? No thanks.... we are pals since kids, shared toys, traded hats, had each other’s back. But when we hang, just the same pals that used to perv on a Victoria Secret!! I don’t even want to know, it would be awkward.... we still split the check , just like we did 25 years ago
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:14:11
Bunch of coinbase drama....
But BTC, ether and LTC look pretty steady despite 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:56:03
For sure not !!! 
Most Americans don’t have 1 month of cash savings equal to their salary yet alone 1 satoshi 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:19:11
High risk high reward....
I’m buying dips to HODL for the moon, but it’s $ that if I lose it’s not life changing 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:01:26
Good on you for that....
There are layers to this game of life, and beneath each layer there is someone whose got something to going by getting over on someone else!
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:07:43
More if you bought the dip
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:37:31
Clearly trying to pump BCH...... dirty dirty
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:50:53
I hope not 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:44:51
We expect such antics no ? HODL or use price dips to get more. Don’t be scared homie !! (But don’t play more than what’s responsible)
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:24:57
Stressful if you have all you’re eggs in one basket &amp; somehow didn’t get the memo that this is volatile and not going to just steadily climb up.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:52:08
I actually bought some ether last week and it’s crushing it right now !
I can’t say anything about biddle because I’m just not read in on it
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:01:39
Unless you blab about it.... same as the 21 year old moron making it rain in the VIP section of the club. Seen lots of guys “wake up” saying “whys my face all swollen and where is my Rolex, stack of cash and daddies blackcard”
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:48:57
Sounds like just you Kiki.... and a few others.
This is to be expected!!! It’s an opportunity to add coin at dips in prices.... if you believe 3 days ago it was still going to go over 20k and beyond, nothing has really changed , you should still believe 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:48:29
I know that there was a fundraiser for building wells in the Congo , and once it was completed they sold the BTC and built the wells. So at least in that instance the org sold and put the money to use immediately. 
You could argue either way..... wait and risk volatility for the hope of more charity...
Or put the donors money to use immediately 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:49:57
Thanks! Have a lovey day yourself dick lips
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:13:12
BTC, ether and LTC all look pretty similar to this morning/ last night.... today’s drama doesn’t seem to have shaken much 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:52:08
Or the exact opposite 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:07:12
Today’s drama barely dented what the values were before.... basically back where it was. Thought, I’m HODL and this just reassuring that it is the right move
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:13:01
You think there is a chance that bitcoin will be below 7k because that’s what you want to believe so you don’t feel bad for not hodling!! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:42:27
Yeah all that drama for nothing so far ... lucky for the aug 1 folks , hope they pump it into BTC
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:45:41
Slept like a baby because I’m a holder :-)
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:02:58
Well said !!
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:33:59
Best. Meme. Ever
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:33
Why give up at that point ? Might as well HODL or go broke
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:46:24
Got some at 15.7..... happy with that. 
It will recoup shortly &amp; then I’m HODL for the mooooon
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:16:21
I got at 12 and 11.9 :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:12:47
Fee looks normal... the price at the time of transfer for 1 BTC Must have dropped so your value went from 1970 to 1830 due to market fluctuations 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:10:44
Would y’all think if it went to 15k some would fire sale and plenty would buy ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:53:43
Push the side burn curls up there too .... all part of the Zionist plot 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:07:45
This adds to demand
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:00:09
There is an ever increasing amount of Bitcoin?????
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:04:54
Cool gift !
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:31:58
You could loose a few hundred bucks (a nice dinner out) , or gain..............? Personal choice.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:48:12
Why don’t you go on a gold forum.... that’s all you post about how great gold is and how shit BTC is.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:43:34
I have the faith it’s gonna go way way up, might have a serous correction, but I that settle point is much higher than right now . 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:17:47
That does not sound normal .... possible operator error ?
