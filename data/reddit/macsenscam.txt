if there were any new laws passed making bitcoin legal tender they would be grandfathered in.  they are just prevaricating and it's not even a plausible excuse since all the other companies are totally fine with it.  it is just a part of what apple does, look at their track record.

They are already so invested in the dollar remaining high that I believe their goals are inflexible at this point; besides, even if the dollar crashes the rich will still get richer via the many other forms of "insurance" they have such as the derivative scams and looting of the public assets.
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:35:35
Oh yea, there's all sorts of loopholes.  I was mainly referring to the amount of reserve liquidity they have to have though.  The other stuff is just (theoretically) preventative, when a run happens you either have the money or you don't.  Also keep in mind that many of these financial giants are *only* regulated by NY law, one court, one office, one DA, and the SEC is only there for assistance when they feel like it.  It's pretty much a joke and they can get away with whatever they want, as we can see in the headlines.

it will be good for bitcoin in the long-run.  for one thing it is a tacit admittance of legitimacy, or at least that it is a legitimate threat.  another factor to consider is that people tend to lust after things that are banned.  i wouldn't be surprised to see entire segments of russian society rallying behind bitcoin now.  
the adjustment we are seeing is the speculators who are trying to make quick cash off the fad, but in reality the forces that will drive bitcoin are people who have lost faith in the real-world economy.  i don't think we can interpret the day-to-day swings in a meaningful way yet, the whole thing is just too new.

What the hell are you talking about?  The "actual economy" is a sinking ship and totally screwed, BC is going to replace it soon enough as long as we can keep jackals like Lawsky from destroying it.  
Besides, Mt. Gox was a cut and dry case of fraud and those people would have gone to prison if they were in NY anyways.  What he's discussing is just a preemptive "punishment" that would apply to the guilty and innocent alike.  But hey, what can we expect from people whose house of cards is going to be torn down as soon as a feasible government-independent currency becomes a big enough idea?
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:56:03
why the hell would you want to destroy mtgox?  this would hurt bitcoin so badly when all people have to do is give them time to work some kinks out.  they are the first people to ever do this, do you think it would just happen perfectly with no errors?

every bank is leveraged on their deposits, that's why there is a bank in the first place.  
this "run" will crate the insolvency even if it wasn't there and kill the price of bitcoin as investor confidence goes to the toilet.  the big-money in bitcoin wants to be able to turn their coin into cash and if the biggest trader can't do this then there is going to be major investor flight.  it's really very silly and immature of people to devalue their money and risk losing it all just because of a technical bug.  gox should stop releasing all coin and doing transactions until the price stops plummeting.  
it's really sad to see sheeple killing their digital institutions just like they did their regular banks before there were regulations stopping runs.  the problem *is* the run, 90% of the time, but when rumors fly the herd-mentality takes over.

So we should have stricter regulations for a company like Mt Gox than for established banks who only have the tiniest fraction of their liability on hand?  
Also, punishment is designed not just for moral satisfaction, but also to deter the crime in question.  We can see by looking at the mess that is the financial system in the US what happens when laws against fraud are not enforced: investors don't know where to put their cash and the economy goes into a permanent state of crapiness.

Not really, they just mobbed the streets and chucked their democratically elected president just so they could (hopefully) get goodies from Russia-hating countries in the West.  They will probably never have democracy now since one half of the country is going to be a NATO stooge and the other half just wants to join with Russia.  Part of being a democratic country is compromising with the portion of the electorate you despise, that is why counties that are truly devoted to functioning democracy end up with *proportional representation*.

Even if the average BC holder doesn't spend money on Microsoft products and the average non-holder is extremely unlikely to convert their cash to BC just to buy a video-game or something, I still see this as a pretty major step in BC's existence.  Microsoft has an influence in reputation in addition to their actual market influence, especially when considering issues of software technology.  Further, they are historically the main foes of Apple, who has recently developed their own attempt to imitate BC's qualities with phone-payment systems.  Microsoft throwing their weight behind BC will likely be seen as an attack on Apple who have banned wallet transactions from their phones.  
Hence we can logically interpret this as Microsoft using the "viral" prestige of BC to cement their image as the "actually smart" Apple alternative that isn't so controlling about every little detail as Apple is; reversing the successful image campaign that Apple itself used against Microsoft so often in the past.
The fact, transparent enough for me anyways, that the giant of computing, the Goliath to Apple's David, has decided that BC can help them commercially obviously gives BC some more credibility.  This may not be true for people that hate Microsoft or think they are idiots, but enough people see Microsoft as techno-wizards that I think this will do a lot psychologically.

bitcoin, being the first, is going to be the most tied to speculative interests.  this will hurt the coin insome ways, but it is necessary for the wisder movement since bc is what people peg the price of all coin to.  we can't judge the success or failure of the concept based on what happens to bitcoin, it is going to behave in much the same manner as any speculative commodity.  we should keep in mind that at present there is no "correct" price for the bc and not bitch about short term losses.  the value of bitcoin will show itself when traditional currencies begin to fall like dominoes.

they're just panicking, it's a classic bank-run scenario.  people should be glad they can't get their money out temporarily because that s the only way they can avoid losing all the money..  the masses never seem to understand that if they devalue their currency in the process of trying to get it right way, they'll never get their full value back.

i think that is just a p.r. line.  there are no signs of any sort of regulation on the horizon.  what is there to regulate?  it's just people trading packets of information.  new laws would have to be written and then apple would have grandfather protection.  if anything, they could sue the government for making a law that hurts their business.
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:03:40
for one thing gates took a larger share of the market so bears more responsibility.  apple's market share has always been limited to less tech-savvy users, so the crappy interface is less of an issue because you wouldn't even try to do a lot of stuff on a mac.  windows on the other hand is a thorn in the side of tech people who are forced to use it.  but the adoption of the smart phone in it's present toy-computer state is apple's fault mostly so maybe they are more evil... i'm thinking this even more so now that they've gone and banned one of the coolest things on the internet.  wtf?
but gates has also continued his evil ways with his "charity" organizations which are really just cash funnels going into the bio-tech and pharma companies he re-invested his microsoft stock into.  that and he is also doing his best to utterly destroy the american public education system, so i think the guy is on another level of evil that goes beyond just making bad computers.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:46:06
so they don't shift one currency to another without you asking them to basically?  i thought they converted it all into bitcoin mostly and then cash.  
i guess i can see how that would be different, but in that case what is even the point of trying to "run" on them?  are people actually worried that they stole it all?  they are probably just having code problems and meanwhile the coin that remains gets slammed...

I love it, this guy thinks that we are so stupid!  Mt. Gox was chump change compared to the rip-offs that go on under this dude's nose every day with absolutely no legal actions taken.  Ah NY, I love my home-state but the government here is a total joke.  Instead of the financial big-wigs trying to "fix" CCs, the CCs need to fix the financial system.  I don't see how any further regulations could possibly help anything, I mean, fraud is already fraud and no one is questioning that.

Gimme a break, the Mt Gox collapse was a run on the bank and could have been prevented if people didn't act in a state of panic like animals.  We have only ourselves to blame for that one.  Also, there are already laws against fraud that Mt Gox could have been brought up on in this country.

your comparing apples to oranges.  if someone is stealing with bitcoin, that was already illegal and so apple could potentially get in trouble.  there is nothing illegal about bitcoin and if it were made illegal apple would have grandfather clause protection.  there is absolutely no risk for them and they are feeding us a line of bullshit.  although i suppose it is possible that apple's legal people have just not looked at any of the facts involved at all so that they could call it "murky" and not be lying...
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:54:25

"they" keep mentioning unknown legal ramifications because it's an easy way to smear the movement with a charge that people accept on a knee-jerk basis, being citizens of a highly policed society.  you have to understand that the media is controlled by massive corporate interests who fear any change that could threaten their control of the money supply.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:30:41
 but isn't the behavior essentially the same?  a glitch in the system caused massive withdrawals that overload it (this will happen to any system be it money or gold, whatever) and making technical issues worse and leading to panic trading. 
even though they aren't handing out cash, they are losing their solvency when bitcoin is withdrawn and at the same time they face solvency pressure because panic trading has caused the value of their holdings to drop drastically.  this could lead to depositors seeing a loss if the "vault" has creditor obligations that it must meet before paying out its depositors.
this scenario differs from the gold analogy only because gold has long-established value, but if the value of gold fluctuated more you could run into the same solvency issues as monetary banks do.  i think it should become common practice to avoid these panic readjustments by locking down the coin when necessary.  the very fact of it becoming standard procedure would make it less nervewracking for investors.  the foundation of the current system is just hoping that the public won't panic and if they do the taxpayer has to bail them out.  this has consistently led to less trust in the financial sector as the dirty laundry never gets aired.  
hopefully most coin owners will see it your way and stick with the coin despite the panic prices, but it still shows how vulnerable we are to the same problems of mass psychology as the fiat currency system.
