I feel stupid. I seemed to have either grossly misunderstood what I was previously told on this subject, or just got bad information. You are correct. Thanks for your comment.

There's a joke that the IRS doesn't care if you tell them you're the new Pablo Escobar as long as they get their cut lol

Well currently BTC is considered property and if you don't report your properties and pay proper taxes on them, the IRS will eat you up. That's why I'm sticking to Binance only. Can't touch a Chinese company!

I love Binance actually. I find it easy to use and I feel like they are really connected with their userbase with weekly posts and contests and stuff. Really recommend it. Also, they have very cheap fees if you use Binance's coin.
As for the withdrawals, I have no idea as I haven't tried withdrawing anything from the site (I day trade the coins so withdrawing would just waste my money).
Regarding the Chinese regulation they seem to have had no problems. The coins that they did have to stop trading kept the withdrawal function on for all of them and Binance just decided to ban Chinese IP addresses to circumvent the Chinese ban. As an American, I saw no negative effect really.

Pretty sure capital gains don't apply since the government considers Crypto as property. Meaning you need to pay taxes on every transaction regardless.
EDIT: I can't post for another 10 minutes and I don't want to wait so just know the dude below me is correct and I am wrong. Seems I am stupid.

BTC isn't capital gains, it's property. You are supposed to pay taxes each time you buy and sell, and for the totals of what you are buying and selling each time. Which adds up to be a fuckton of money if you trade regularly over a year. That's what they care about and want.

You are correct. Turns out I shouldn't have believed the dude that told me this was the case. And honestly, happy it is your way.
