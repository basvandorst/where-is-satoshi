I have. I have the original email that was sent to me when I created the wallet. In addition to that email I have transaction id’s. 
In the original email there’s nothing listing password or recovery phrase

My wife is a nurse and makes between $45,000-$50,000. I supplemented some of the losses income eBaying. 
We have three children ages 5, 3 and 7 months. The first two were planned, the third...well we had fun making her. 
We would have been fine financially with the first two, the third really changed things. Once I found out we were expecting I began searching for another job, no luck...haven’t given up though. 
This entire situation has caused problems with our marriage. My wife left 3 months and we are working thru this. It’s kind of rock bottom. 
Probably a little more info than I expected to share but feels good getting it of my chest. 
The bitcoin would help get me caught up and give me a little cushion. I’m trying.

Thanks for the message. I went from making $100k a year a few years ago to less than $20k, my reasoning...to be a stay at a home dad for my newborn children. Needed a break from corporate America. The time at home with the kids has been amazing, wonderful...however bills have not been paid. I purchased a bitcoin 3 or 4 years ago, just remembered it. 
I’ve been looking for jobs for the last 12-16 months, it’s caused my marriage to almost end. I feel great that I was able to be a Dad, but I’ve almost lost it all from the decision. I’ll bounce back...just need some time, and my password. Thanks

And I never thought it was a better option, I just wanted to be a dad. Something just made it seem right. I know it doesn’t make sense, but I had to make the move.
