@_date: 2014-08-24 14:46:21
renew the domain. save yourself a lot of headache and then later change your email.

He's basically warning you that the USD is about to lose it's status as the word's reserve currency and that the USD is gonna tank. HARD. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:27:43
But like the op said localbitcoins would be the fastest. But you'd have to buy in smaller increments at a time.

Question: Can you contact your bank and notify them that you have been the victim of fraud and have the transaction(s) reversed(especially since you have proof)???? 
@_date: 2014-09-25 01:43:56
Congrats! Maybe by some silver or gold too at some point(That's what I did)! Or just more BTC! 
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:36:07
Are you sure that email is from paypal and not a scam???
@_date: 2016-01-28 03:13:15
yes. its fucking annoying
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:36:24
**[Serious]**: what actions are cause for a person's comment being removed, or getting banned all together from this sub?? examples??
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:05:19
I see. Thanks for the detailed response!
@_date: 2015-04-03 19:17:07
alright I see now. thx.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:27:21
Why? coinbase is regulated and u wouldn't want to be anywhere near that considering what you for a living. Just do your research heavily here on before considering to use coinbase or any other online wallet/bitcoin services.
**Edit:** I understand now that what she was saying was that she will consider no longer using coinbase.
@_date: 2015-03-30 06:08:57
BUY SILVER AND GOLD TOO! 
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:39:02
Dude ignore the rude comments. Get a multibit wallet for bitcoin and a Multi-Doge wallet for dogecoin. Move your coins once you get it up and running. Then do a TON of research on bitcoin/crypto currency wallets, how to back up our dat file AND learn everything you can about cold storage and paper wallets. you can learn most of if here at r/bitcoin just by searching this subreddit. Good luck.
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:03:27
Have you downloaded the multibit wallet yet for your computer?? Have you looked into cold storage options too like paper wallets, Armory etc?? Have you gotten in contact with a laywer?? I would tell them that if this isn't handle with 7 days that you are going to get a lawyer because what you are going through is absolute bullshit. You have too much money tide up on circle when you know you didn't do anythin to have your acct frozen. Always transfer your bitcoins to a wallet that you own as soon as you receive them. Period. Never trust online wallets. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 04:18:56
Congrats! Dude just use paper wallets!!
Just download/save the page to your desktop, then burn it to a CD or Thumb_drive and then use it on a computer that isn't connected to the internet. Or at the very least make sure that u are completely disconnected from the internet and run it off of a USB or CD-R(preferably). **MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GENERATE KEYS WHILE ONLINE** I have had some coins stored on paper wallet since Nov 2013 and I just checked and they are still there! Treznor is cool if u can afford it but paper wallets are free.
@_date: 2015-02-26 23:15:59
Did u get ur coins back?
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:35:28
Thanks for info. I thought that was the case but wasn't sure.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:35:49
He's talking about this:
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:55:02
Oh wow that's just so....... mark of the beast. I think that's a swell idea and I can't wait to get chipped for my bitcoin. Yeaaah! 0_0
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:27:42
People are people know matter where they live or what government is over them. The people of china, if not now will eventually purchase goods and services with bitcoin.  They will simply make purchases 'under the table' for goods and services, and the Chinese government already knows this.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:45:08
I have litecoins. But I feel if you were to diversify it would be better to own some Bitcoin, Litcoin, Gold and silver. VERY little fiat if you can help it. Both gold and silver are undervalued and are set to explode soon. Since bitcoin is so limited in number(even if with satoshis) it would be could to spread your wealth around and diversify, but now put all of your egg into one basket.
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:05:17
What if they bought up as many bitcoins as they could now and just held onto them and not allowed them to circulate within the block-chain? To have say 40-60% monopoly. Could they maybe slow down or hinder the use of bitcoins in that way as an effort to manipulate the use of bitcoins in their favor?
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:59:21
I've also been waiting longer than usual today. Its been almost 2 hrs and still haven't had one confirmation yet(big transaction). :/
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:53:55
Make sure you are offline first before you generate addresses. You can save the website and burn it to a disk and run it offline. Test it out first by transferring a very low amount(a few cents worth) into the paper wallet. Also, make sure to learn how to properly retrieve your funds from the wallet before transferring a large amount of funds into them.
I personally like to use this app for my android phone when retrieving paper wallets. Makes it SUPER easy:
This is a more technical(and somewhat time consuming) process to retrieving a paper wallet via Bitcoin QT:
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:28:40
Well I would rather buy 1 bitcoin now at $500+ and it have the purchasing power to buy a house at $200,000 (at a later date), then buy 0.00003 btc when 1 bitcoin is now worth $200,000 and its only worth $10 in usd. What LTC is currently valued at now will not stay that way for long. No investor would miss a clear opportunity to invest in another currency(making potentially 500%-1000% return) when it already has an established network and growing community. People will be forced to look for other alternatives(while still investing in Bitcoin) in order to have more purchasing power and gain a greater return on their money.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:49:23
-Confirmation times are faster
-Higher currency cap
-Its more memory intensive so you don't need to buy those stupid expensive mining rigs.
But I'm not expecting Litecoin to ever go as high as bitcoin. Just to go for a ride along WITH bitcoin. LTC has been around longer than the other alt-coins, so they will have to establish themselves as a credible currency first just like LTC has had to do and has done. People will always invest in bitcoin. But they will look for alternatives too. And besides, once the USD(and other fiat currencies) collapse ANYthing will be better than fiat. Silver and gold will also go through the roof, so LTC will also have a chance to rise quickly because of that as well.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:56:23
I will now start referring to random strangers as "dude guy".
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:13:25
Mine to. I have only $.40 cents worth on the wallet. I wanted to verify first if i could properly transfer it out of the wallet before I used it with a larger amount. I tried using the Mycelium app from my phone and it was a no go. I didn't try anything else.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:56:39
Well the US Gov is beginning to clamp down on it and the only reason they would do that, is if they see it as a threat to the USD(which it is). Right now $500 is cheap for bitcoin. Some say its a fad or bubble and will crash.  I say its a hedge/security blanket against the USD for when it crashes soon. No one will want USDs or any other fiat currency when that happens. Youtube 'Economic Collapse'(old and new videos) and you will get alot of information there. I expect Bitcoin to rise to $10,000 minimum. LTC to go to where Bitcoin is now(or close to it) when bitcoin reaches $10,000.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:38:57
Invest now.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:21:43
In my honest opinion you should buy now. If you were lucky enough to buy over the weekend when the price was lower, that was probably you last chance to do so. The price of bitcoin and other alt-coins will go through the roof once the US dollar collapses(very soon) and you will wish you had bought in when it was $340-$370(which will be considered a steal soon). Others will probably say to wait, and let the price drop some. But then they probably don't know what coming. I say buy now before its too late and 1BTC = $1000 to $10,000 USD. :/
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:06:39
i.e. the US Dollar is one example.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:45:59
I noticed the same thing on GOX. :/ Strange. Maybe another DDOS attack!?!?
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:41:50
In my opinion, I would only cash out half(maybe even a little less than that) of your silver stash and quickly buy into bitcoin. But be quick about it. Also, Silver is only that low because its been manipulated low and should be at least $100/oz. Minimum Once the banks lose control over gold and silver manipulations, silver(like bitcoin) will also go through the roof. Also, many people don't realize that silver is actually more rare than gold because it has so many industrial, medical, etc uses in the world, the world has used up most of the above ground available silver. That too is something you can take into consideration.

[This guy accidentally]( found out what the passcode to a random brain wallet was. They say you should not use a brain wallet because of how easy they are to hack. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:49:31
Hmmm from what you stated it sounds like when your wife used your netbook and connected to the home internet connection(which she was never supposed to do) the trojan, malware, etc.. was then able to steal your coins. I'm so sorry. :(
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:20:32
what OS do you use (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux)? I'm glad that you had the rest already in cold storage. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:28:10
But you can't use the merchant terminals correct?
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:42:59
Most likely........
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:27:29
Thank you for returning the coins. You've helped to erase some of the negative karma that's within the bitcoin community today. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:38:20
Yes. :/
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:11:10
How did you get hacked? Online wallet or Locally stored?? key-logger maybe??
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:11:01
I honestly don't know what you could do unless you some how knew the location of the perp(s) who did it. I feel really bad for you man. I appreciate you posting your story and I'm learning a lot from reading posts like this of what to watch out for. I thought about selling bitcoins online at one point but I will never do that now after reading so many stories about sellers getting scammed.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:03:54
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:21:18
I'm assuming then that you can only use their service in Canada correct?
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:11:24
I understand that I am taking a big risk in investing LTC and I understand that I could be terribly wrong and if it decides to go nowhere and completely go under. Yes, right now LTC is not looking to good. But I honestly like this is a major opportunity with LTC with where it currently stands.  So I'm sticking to my guns on this one. I won't be investing in anymore crypto currencies anyways as I feel I have put a sufficient amount into them. I'm going back into investing in silver bullion. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:15:17
Ya know I've read one too many negative stories about BTC-e in the last 2 weeks. O_o That's it. I'm now officially done with them. It's like playing with fire when you use BTC-e. Though I haven't been burned by them......yet, I don't want to find out the hard way that I should have walked away but didn't. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:12:13
I referring buying bitcoin in whole amounts. Not in satoshis. Its cheaper to buy 1 whole litecoin than one whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:11:58
oh that makes a lot more sense now. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:44:50
It looks like you will be charged twice. Contact them immediately and tell them which transaction you would like to cancel and which one you want to keep.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:07:05
I asked because I thought that maybe there was some sort of announcement(like the news out of China yesterday) that drove the price down(again).
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:34:56
I use firefox too and I am always in privacy mode. When I use the bitaddres.org file, I log off the internet and then select 'Work Offline' Will it save my "sessions" then??

I feel Bitcoin will continue to rise for a number of years. But I have also diversified into Litecoin because I feel it too will continue to rise in value. I invested more in Litecoin than Bitcoin because Litecoin is only at $8+ at the moment. If you want a more safe investment with less volatility, gold or silver would be a better choice.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:18:16
Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:57:43
What happens if he instead trades them in for an litecoins, peercoins or something??? Doesn't that remove them from being traced period???
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:21:32
I think its great that your investing in BitCoin! You will be very thankful you did as the price goes up. :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:52:23
Nice cake. Happy birthday
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:04:43
Eventually it was confirmed. I don't know the amount that was paid in fees because I didn't pay(it was sent from someone else to me). But I asked and they did say that the fees were paid. They also said that the network propagation was terrible(at the time) and that another transaction he made was also very slow to confirm. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:17:04
Thanks man! You really saved the day!
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:11:13
yeah but that site that they were stolen from was an illegal site to begin with. And since you used a mixer several times, there is no "real" proof tying those coins to him. AND if he goes to say BTC-e, they are based in the Ukraine so I don't see them having to deal with authorities anyway unless its Interpol or something. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:38:59
Well [this guys boa account was canceled]( probably due to BOA's fears over bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:06:09
I have the same problem. Was it encrypted with BIP38??
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:31:08
It seems to me is all that it would take is for somebody to come along and offer the mixing of coins to remain anonymous. But instead of mixing the same coin, they could just mix different coins altogether, like BTC with LTC with PPCOIN, with Namecoin, etc. etc. How would you then trace that, and its not even an exchange? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:55:48
I feel like LTC will go up as BTC continues to rocket up. Its getting more more expensive to purchase BTC. Of course one could always by in smaller increments. But it will be a lot cheaper to buy LTC in bulk than BTC(obviously). 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:34:06
Great reply. I really liked your idea about having bitcoin being valued in Gold and silver and not in fiat. Banks are manipulating the price of GLD/SLV down in the 'paper' or stocks markets. I definitely think they would be afraid of having bitcoin be valued against gold because they can't manipulate the gold markets forever!
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:10:43
....and its back back up again.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:08:35
When I first heard about bitcoin(2011), I thought it was a good idea but that it would never go anywhere because it wasn't a "real" currency like gold or silver. So I continued to invest in precious metals as a hedge against the USD. Now I regret not investing in Bitcoin when it was stupid cheap. And I didn't because I let my ego and "logic" get the best of me. I won't make that same mistake again, which is one of many reason why I invest in LTC. I also love how confirmation times are much faster than BTC. It won't be much longer because people start taking more notice of LTC and push the price up.
