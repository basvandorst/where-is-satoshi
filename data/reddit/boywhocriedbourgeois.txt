I think it really depends on how much you have and how much time/money you're willing to put into security. Greenbits is a good Android wallet with segwit but it's a multisig wallet. If you don't know what that means then you may want to research or keep your BTC on an exchange. BTC is about empowering you to make your own decisions. Hardware wallets are great, but expensive and require some technical knowledge.

For a lot of people who don't have a large amount invested Coinbase is probably going to be more secure and less of a hastle than managing their own security. I don't think there is anything wrong with this. Eventually everything will become easier to use and more secure.

(from an American perspective) If nothing else it is a store of value that can beat inflation with a low cost of entry. USD inflates at about 2.2%/year. If you want to keep the same value (or actually gained some interest) you need to buy something like real estate, not cheap, or perhaps a previous metal, expensive and not very liquid. BTC is as cheap as you want and in the long term is very likely to retain its value.

I'm talking about savings. Something you will hold for a medium to long term. A known inflation rate and a fixed supply, along with a deflationary pressure from lost coins makes it seemingly a very good long term store of value at a low cost of entry.
Edit: not disagreeing with you.

One thing to prevent the second problem is to just have both parties put in more than they will spend. Then it is in both party's interest to behave properly. Upon opening of LN channel I want to send 50btc to party B I put in 100 and party B puts in 100. Now both parties are incentivised to transact and finish legitimately.

It's locked up until both parties agree to close out the transactions. Satoshi already talked about this with multi-sig escrow. The lightning network works on a system of trust saying if you give the funds to the next node then you get the previous funds. Unless the end seller (who is known to the buyer) chooses to screw the buyer and himself over by locking up the funds of both parties it's pretty safe and no more risk than what already exists with stores except no TTP in the middle.

Bitcoin has the most networked nodes increasing network effect. It was made with security as it's number one feature. It has the most and the most capable devs and it has many users who want to keep it safe and useful. 
However, it isn't the best because there's no definition of best. If I want a turing complete coin, then Bitcoin is not currently it. If I want a completely anonymous coin, Bitcoin is not it. Bitcoin is really good at one thing and that is its designed purpose of putting people back in charge of their money.

That's true, but they've indicated they want to add more coins, they already have engineers working on BCH, it almost seems inevitable. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:27:05
Yes, but only if Coinbase legitamizes BCH and offers it as a sellable coin. But selling it for more BTC and then moving offline is a great idea.
Edit: not my sub nor my fight, if BCH wants to exist and do whatever they want go ahead. But I won't ever hold BCH.

This is a myth by everything I can tell. Also if there were enough of a need then more ISPs would come in to the market. It's not impossible to lay fiber if people insist on using landlines, but there are many other technologies able to deliver bandwidth. Google uses weather balloons, many municipal services use line of sight, I can go on but you get the point. As far as I can tell the only thing preventing more ISPs from existing is lack of need or govt regulations.

I don't understand what about blockchain is Earth-shattering outside of decentralization? Is it just the fact that the last hash is hashed into the new block? If that's the case you need PoW and on an intranet it would be trivially easy to override the legitimate blockchain. The block chain to me seems like a wonderful key for one door and one door only and a mediocre key for a database or any other ledger.

I think it's here: 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:46:28
I can only speak for myself, but I don't think the original vision has changed. If high fees are a big concern there a few things you can do to reduce fees and wait times. First is to always manually set your fees. Letting wallets always set your fees often means you're paying an unnecessarily high fees because the wallet provider is more concerned with giving their customers a good and fast experience than necessarily a cheap one. Checking the mempool to see what fees are currently clearing is a good way of setting your fees accordingly. Also, another very important fee cutting step is to make sure all your BTC is in segwit addresses, they will usually clear faster and more cheaply than non-segwit transactions. If it is a really big concern for you then you can help participate in one of the scaling developments that are happening now. LN and Schnorr signatures are the two big ones I'm aware of. And of course there's always owning some lightcoin for super quick and low fee transactions. Hope that helps.
Edit: Just checked the mempool, it looks like around 10 sat/b are clearing so that's pretty low, something like $0.20
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:00:25

Greenbits seems to be the best to me. Segwit, it's by an established company, good design, can set your own fees.... May even be able to connect a segwit trezor on Android soon.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:05:55
True, bit simply having the option to actually own the money is worth it. Realistically everyone managing their own opsec is probsbly unrealistic unless some very clever person figures out a way to make it simple and fool-resistant.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:45:38
Also a noob here. Please don't flame me if this is entirely wrong/ignorant. 8mb blocks mean miners can get more transactions into a block and that means more transaction fees for less work. It also means that Bitcoin can have lower fees and maybe process faster. Seems like a win-win. 
The downside would be that it would take a lot more harddisk space and bandwidth to run a full node, so it would centralize the node network more by having a higher barrier of entry. No segwit because.....it's not necessary?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:52:20
I'm no expert but I think the point would be to have so many people involved in one transaction that the per person fee is small. But I could be entirely wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:23:33
90% of my BTC is in segwit addresses right now. I'm in no hurry to move anything so I pay small fees and they get moved whenever someone picks them.

How many confirmations does it have? If it shows up on your wallet then you know at least that address is correct but SoP says to use a new address each time. Also, if you're transferring from Coinbase/GDAX it will take a while, they're having some volume problems right now. I would sit tight for just a while unless you NEED to move them over.

I'm guessing more stuff is coming. The various dev communities around the above projects seem to be making advancements and milestones pretty regularly. However Bitcoin never promised to be feeless cash, in fact fees are what will sustain the blockchain more and more in the future. If you want feeless digital cash then BTC and it's derivatives may not be what you want. However if you want low friction, uncensorable cash then congratulations you're here. $0.20 is cheap and it seems it will only get cheaper.
 There's one other thing you seem to be factoring into the problem that shouldn't be there. BTC is now worth 2x what it was in terms of USD 2 months ago, but 1 BTC still equals 1 BTC. If BTC goes up 1000x then that same $0.20 fee is now $200. Fees are relative to other currencies if you price them in other currencies. That doesn't mean it's a broken system. Ideally everyone would just stop pricing things in $ and price them in BTC and then you would have a constant fee rate.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:38:12
I highly doubt they could have any effective blocking mechanism (see China), plus if they are that determined then you could just sign up with an ISP that doesn't do that. It's not hard. I would even bet that if it was a problem you would have an ISP who markets themselves as uncensored AND uses that as their market advantage.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:20:39

I've only ever bought from Coinbase/GDAX, the mycellium wallet buy feature goes through another exchange, you don't get to buy directly through the wallet and I've heard the fees are higher and slower. My opinion is it would be better to use coinbase and send to mycellium.
 My current setup is to use GDAX for transaction fee free buying and transfer it to Greenbits on my Android or my Trezor, they both support segwit addresses (faster, smaller fee).
