Please be our leader in asking for this. Bitcoin and Wikipedia belong together. There should be a public  bitcoin address and a button for lightning invoice at the bottom of every page.
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:30:26
Academia leans left. Is there any evidence that any Wikipedia bias isn't just a symptom of that?

I think it's perfectly reasonable to only accept bitcoin in the US if you're dealing with repeat or big customers. They can easily buy using platforms like Cash App. But if it's a lot of one-time customers and small amounts and they don't care about privacy, they will probably think it's too much of a pain.
Something to be aware of since you've been out of the space is BitPay. This payment processor has a large marketshare and force users to go through the BIP70 protocol. I'd avoid them if possible as BIP70 has privacy and security concerns for users, and the BitPay approach generally goes against bitcoinism. I recommend checking out BTCPay, or if you want something easy, CoinBase Commerce.
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:50:14
Yet he couldn't quite figure out privacy or scaling. That part is left for us.
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:46:43
Nice analysis but title is slightly misleading. 


Edit: Also looks like volumes are reported in BTC, not any stable currency, so average price is a big hidden factor if we're talking about actual value invested.

They said it will be on F Droid for version 1.0
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:01:30
Google Play app is appropriate because they'll likely offer these features in direct download and F-Droid versions.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:00:02
73% of these statistics are bullshit 
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:59:42
I think your point is good, but still day-to-day wallet amounts probably aren't significant to the market. I also agree itd good for the reputation too.
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:01:57
Your credit card? I'm talking about the fees merchants usually pay.
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:05:13
It's great for everyone to use bitcoin, but really mainstream adoption for day-to-day use is not critical to bitcoin changing the world. Similar to having an armed populace, everyone doesn't need to use guns regularly or even own them for it to be a factor in hostile neighbor's decision to invade, or a tyrranical government to implement oppressive policies. (You can argue about whether rifles count, but thats not the point. Picture private cannons and militias from American colonial days if it helps. Or Syria.) The point is people have it at their disposal and that ability cannot be systematically removed.
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:19:38
Yes, we should not rely on governments to protect our monetary freedom. However, better legislation makes securing our own liberty significantly easier.

Gemini is as good as it gets for storing crypto in a custodial account. Only thing more secure is owning your own bitcoin.

Nice wallet. The phone number thing is worth it for day-to-day use IMO. Open source soon, and flag BIP70 with security warning please!

So yep, this addess recieved 1.94 BTC on Jan 15. You must have a wallet problem. Have you tried recovering your wallet using a different app/software?
Edit: I see others have recommended the same. Good luck!

Incentive mechanism only breaks if certain parties have exclusive control of the quantum power and decide they'd rather destroy bitcoin than mine it.
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:35:53
Maybe someone can clarify the model used but I'm guessing the $340k only covers energy; not capital investment or opportunity cost of wasting all that hashpower. Also I don't think the logistics would work out as far as acquiring control of that much hardware. Finally, the benefit would be minimal since you'd render bitcoin worthlesss before you could double spend and cash out enough to make it worth while.
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:06:31
Tough part is updates. F Droid a good alternative though.

It's like she was going to say crypto winter and then forgot what she was typing.
@_date: 2019-01-14 03:27:09
For one, the basis of the system is sound money as opposed to state fiat. Also, since the barrier of entry is low, competition should be very tight for any custodians looking to exploit users. Custiodial wallets aren't ideal, but as long as they're part of a decentralized ecosystem I don't see a big problem for small ("wallet") amounts.
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:21:20
Cool starry brah

Sounds like its dump bag of coins, print CoinMe gift card, find CoinMe ATM, provide stool sample for KYC/AML, get bitcoin back. Not quite as sickkk.

@_date: 2019-01-08 06:20:22
Russia, China, and other powers that aren't in the US's inner circle will soon realize bitcoin is a viable alternative to both SWIFT and the USD as a reserve currency. It's only a matter of time.

I think if you're 5 just use BlueWallet for instant ultra-cheap transactions.

No but that would work too

Before anyone criticizes the cost, centralization aspect,  or fact that needing this is an issue, I want to point out that this service presents a very elegant immediate solution to one of the biggest complaints of lightning. Like exchanges, services like this will pave the way to adoptiand usability. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:07:47
Here is another option I just saw (on this sub). Thor from BitRefill will open a channel with you on demand.
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:11:27
Curious on the method if you have a minute for an ELI5
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:07:57
I know what you mean but I disagree that they're an enemy. Their mission is to make crypto palatable to the establishment, and the US is still one of the best establishments of all time. As long as they let users withdrawl funds, they're what we need. Once the masses hold crypto, the rest will be history.
Now, if you decide not to withdraw funds, that's on you.
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:15:17
Any evidence that it was a thing?
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:11:49
Probably more relevant as an illustration of how money is becoming digitized and there is a need for a decentralized solution to avoid trivially easy systematic surveillance and censorship. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:56:38
Yeah I would still want it to show up first on google. Just with that understanding. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 17:38:30
Amazon via bitrefill got card?
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:13:11
I run a node but I still don't quite understand how I'm supposed to go about receiving payments greater than what I've spent on lightning. All my channels are weighted on my side.

I do agree with his point though. It's a tough call between convenience of BitPay and the principles of security, privacy, and openness. If we cave now BitPay may never really be challenged.

Sharing seeds among wallets means your keys are only as secure as the weakest wallet.

@_date: 2018-12-28 03:36:56
These analyses are totally bogus though since one individual may own many addresses, and one address may represent many individuals.

1% on transactions plus 2% when they convert to native currency? Doesn't that end up being roughly the same cost as a credit card?
