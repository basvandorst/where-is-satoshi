Please stop posts about this scam, let it sink, and we all will be happy.
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:49:44
Thanks, but im straight and not intrested.
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:40:31
Dude google it. If you not trust me, google it. It's common knowledge that high fees of Bitcoin were because of a attack. But, anyway, i will not tell you more, you can find it.
google - "Bitcoin high transactions fees attack"

So now we have memes with ads, what's next?
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:13:11
We should stop to post here this scam. Just keep it straight Bitcoin, not altcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:25:57
It's normal. Bitcoin start it. I belive in some altcoins, they have thier place in industry, but that dosen't mean, i don't belive in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:27:22
I downvote only because it's not related to Bitcoin.

I will never want to wipe my ass with a bank note.
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:20:29
Im in bitcoin and other cryptos so long, but don't know what flippening means, can someone tell me? Im not native, maybe that's why.
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:15:56
These fees were that high, because Bitcoin was attacked.
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:21:13
Happy reddit cake day!

Data is expensive
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:44:47
There is only one thing, that keeps data, and can't be "hackable", it's a paper.
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:02:41
If you know a addres of this wallet, you can check it on blockchain, if is there something. Maybe try to sync that wallet on perfect working hdd, not corrupted or fixed.

Jokes on you guys, but actually, i would help with recover for 5% fee. Let's say there are 5000bitcoins, its 250bitcoins fee. I would help and live happy with these 250bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:50:40
I don't know why mr. jetrucci was downvoted. He telling the true. Kinda part after telling about businesses was not necessary, but still.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:28:20

I wonder, if cars like these with that plate, are actually from Bitcoin investor/hodler, or from rich guys who takes money from parents, and want to be trendy.
@_date: 2019-11-13 14:53:53
First issue i saw is when i want to select category when searching. You should be able to close "category window" when you press mouse outside it. I will try look up on your site when i will have more time.

One of the crypto rules, when you buy a dip, it's goes dipper.

Before buying any Bitcoin, you should ask if they accept it as a payment. If yes, it's okay, if not, just leave.
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:43:12
What the fuck is "thy"
edit  
HOLY HOLY i just learn new word
@_date: 2018-06-15 21:39:32
This need to stop, it's ridiculous. First site with drawing, i can understand, but this? It is like making a website, where i can put my address, and you will DONATE me for only showing your nickname on the website. How many "GAMES" they will create, it is like scams, but in this case, you agree to loose money. Should i put my twitch.tv channel, and promote it here, and says you can write something with donation? C'mon guys..

I can agree with it. It can help, you are right.
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:18:24
In Japan they have even a TV commercials about exchanges and bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:35:39
You said "Bitcoin core vs Bitcoin cash", bitcoin core is a wallet for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:26:12
You don't OWN a coinbase wallet, so in case of a hack or something, you can loose your coins.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:09:05
I don't know about commercials ban in us, but i might know why you gets ads in japan about crypto, because for example, in some countries, like US, banks want to fight against bitcoin, in Japan, banks want to involve bitcoin in thier system, to make money, with is good.

You can remember it as that, but it's not true.

I don't get it
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:14:08
Bitcoin core? A wallet attack bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:03:14
.gif is better
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:06:50
True, posts like this without anything else is just begging :/
@_date: 2019-02-27 16:16:50
Is Bitcoin needed to do that? Cuz that would be good argument for me to buy.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:42:47
This meme have less quality repost after repost
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:35:48
Very well done :D
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:14:23
It doesn't matter for these who post it here, they want more followers on twitter, so they post it on twitter and post it thier twitter here. Simple.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:10:30
Thanks man.
@_date: 2018-11-29 12:28:38
If i install Bitcoin core wallet on my raspberry pi, it sync and i have at least 8 connections, and unlock ports, that's mean i have a full working node? Is there a site or something that i can verify it?
@_date: 2018-11-04 02:56:36
This photo is from january, but still nice pic.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:10:20
Yesterday i check and it was 12connections, so might work. I didin't setup a node for years, so just checking.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:41:42
But bitcoin is isin't a bubble
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:57:54
They work, so they are not that stupid like you think.

Before it has been creeping up for months.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:00:59
I do, ofc.
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:19:54
Yes, i think it will go up, with technology, usage, adoption and ofc price, but don't ask about specific number ;)
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:17:18
Why you so sure, that price right now, is not a price manipulation?
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:51:17
Yes, my mistake.
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:01:50
Scams? I see what you tryin' to do, but you are wrong mister.
I mean, trump voters work, have a jobs.

I heard about hamsters crypto experts, but some pepole telling me that real experts are pandas. Who knows
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:49:50
Who tought, that was good idea to replace gif with this?
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:06:40
I downvote because this is not @_date: 2018-07-28 13:52:46
That was my mistake. I say "had a jobs", sorry. They have a jobs, my mistake, im not native english person.

Did you subscribe to pewdiepie?
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:35:46
Yep, this is the word i search for.
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:49:03
Do they accept Bitcoin as a payment? If not, this is unacceptable.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:30:20
/s is sarcasm?
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:52:14


This remind me about alien vs humans movies, where aliens see only USA from space. Bitcoin will take place of many other fiats, not just usd -.-

PC MASTER RACE! And also, please stop posting about other coins, let them die.

Screenshot was taken from cmc not a exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:34:44
Stop posting about this altcoin. Let this shitty scam coin die already.
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:33:33
Wrong price on screenshot.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:59:48
And this is another way to shill coins. For some reason there is iota, which is not even in top10 according to cmc. In other words, you can put there any altcoin, but pepole who create these images, put what they currently hodl.
