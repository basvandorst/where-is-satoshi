Got it. Yes, the issue is that there are no actual “bitcoins”. No units are “sent”, no units are “stored” in wallets, etc. We use these terms to simplify / abstract what is really happening, which is just the changing of numbers in the ledger.
So in reality there is no such thing as an actual bitcoin – but there is a Bitcoin ledger full of numbers, and anyone can go read it.

Don't use backticks (\`) as apostrophes (' or ’). Especially since Reddit uses markdown, wherein backticks are used to create `code blocks`.

Not entirely sure what you mean, but that's likely more due to me than you. I'm computing market cap as simply the current number of bitcoins in existence (16.8M, max 21M some time next century) times the current market value for a single bitcoin (~$15k). That would put today's market cap at ~$250B. The fact that bitcoins are constantly being bought and sold doesn't affect that figure (except by revealing the current market price of course). Volume does not directly affect cap.

What exactly is your purpose in asking this question? It seems surprising coming from someone whose history shows an awareness of what BTC is already. Is it rhetorical?
In any case, I shall answer – bitcoin is numbers associated with ID's in a global public document. Only the ID controllers are physically able to cause "their" number to go down for a corresponding increase in someone else's number. Anyone can go read this document, which is disseminated online, but nobody can change it arbitrarily.
That's it. The mathematical plumbing / proof system is very interesting, as are the economic implications / intentions. From here you can branch into "it's a global decentralized ledger based on a cryptographic blockchain using proof-of-work" or "it's a new way of paying for things online via a trustless settlement system" etc., but in concrete terms, it's numbers in a canonical shared document.

Coinbase is already a deposit institution. Coinbase users don't control their coins, they have an IOU from Coinbase to give them back their coins if they ask for them. If you have an account on Coinbase you aren't participating in BTC directly at all – only once Coinbase actually sends you BTC does the blockchain become involved. Batching would be a better way of doing that. Either way, you are trusting Coinbase to hold and/or send your coins at your request.

To clarify for other readers – is pointing out that if something at $X loses nine tenths (90%) of its value, it needs to subsequently gain ninefold (900%) just to get back to its original $X. If something loses 90% value, then gains 90% on the new low, it's still only at (1 - (1 * 0.9)) * 1.90 = 0.19, i.e. 19% of its original high.

Actually the downvote button is “supposed” (according to Reddit) to be used to mark content that doesn’t add to the discussion or sub in any meaningful way. It’s not supposed to be used for dislike or disagreement. Of course, 99% of people use it as a dislike button anyway. /shrug

No offense taken. I just used US GDP as an arbitrary point of reference, as in "do you really think that Bitcoin could end up six times bigger than the annual product of one of the worlds' wealthiest nations". If we're trying to make the comparison more apples to apples however, then someone else pointed out that money supply is a better choice than GDP anyway.

This is not in any way, shape, or form a known truth. It might turn out to be true, but there is literally no way to know this beforehand.
The video makes a good point, which is that BTC has weathered multiple bubbles at different stages of its overall price increase to date. Extrapolating that and saying "BTC will always go up" however is simply wrong – for one thing, it literally cannot go up forever.
If you're going to put money into cryptocurrencies, do it for better reasons than "well in the past it went up."

Er, it's not, though. Jan–Feb is 9% growth, Feb–Mar 13%, Mar–April 5%, skipping ahead… Oct–Nov 73%, Nov–Dec 41%, Dec–Xmas is 80% etc. It's not only not linear growth (which would be a constant slope, i.e. the percentage increase month over month would go _down_) it's also not a constant rate increase (e.g. a steady 10% month over month) – this is a somewhat wobbly higher-order growth.

Low-key fishing for random donations. That's the polite way to put it.

It is real data. It's a log chart. Not linear, every "tick" represents _multiplying_ rather than adding. For example 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 would all be equally spaced from each other. Log charts represent quadratic functions as straight line plots. This makes it easier to understand growth in terms of relative percentages rather than absolute differences.
Now, drawing a chart and then thinking you can extrapolate off the edge into the future is fundamentally unadvisable. Past trends do not dictate future performance.

An obvious problem is that for 1 BTC to be worth that much, and considering the number of BTC already mined… BTC's market cap starts to do silly, fairly unbelievable things. Things like surpass gold, surpass US GDP, surpass world GDP etc. It cannot literally grow unbounded, there is only so much value in existence.
Let's see, US GDP is $19T. Divide by 16.8M Bitcoins and you get 1.13M $/BTC. So at $6M, BTC's cap would be almost six times greater than the entire US GDP. Does that seem even remotely possible to you? It shouldn't.
Yes, I know market cap isn't a very good metric for BTC. But the point is to put things into perspective.

Good call, these comparisons are all flawed but supply makes a lot more sense than annual product.

I like how many BTC memes seem to completely ignore the implications of their source material.
[SPOILERS AHEAD]
The architect was wrongly arrogant in this scene – Neo, "The One," ended up defying expectations and winning a new future for humanity. Why would you use this imagery to suggest that a new contender is doomed to fail because previous ones failed? This scene heralds almost the exact opposite result. Also, the Architect was, if not quite a villain, at least a major antagonist. A weird stand-in for BTC on a pro-BTC sub.
I don't know anything about Bitcoin Diamond and its implications, I'm just finding the choice of imagery perplexing. I get that it's funny on a shallow level, I guess that's all memes really need, but come on…
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:12:00
Sure, there may be an element of self-fulfilling prophecy. Just wanted to understand that these charts, while accurate in portraying past data, do not scientifically guarantee anything with respect to the future.
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:41:48
I would hope not. However, the first time I read it, I misinterpreted post to refer to BTC having to gain 900% of its current ~$11.5k value to return to its ATH of ~$19.5k, which obviously would not be right. So while the mistake was mine (not seeing the full context and extrapolating his meaning), I figured if I had made that mistake, others might as well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:51:21
Thank you for this helpful answer, this makes the matter much clearer. I now understand that the gains are relative to the *value of BTC*, so 0.2 BTC for $1k represents $800 in gains compared to its original value of $200. Just required looking at it from the right perspective, now it seems quite obvious.

Just wanted to say, I think it's pretty cool that you're offering this and I hope someone can help you out. I'd maybe code a script to run the search if I was more familiar with cryptography, e.g. what algo to use to actually check candidates against the encrypted target… but I'm not, so I'll cross my fingers for you.

Having money isn't all about acquiring material possessions or indulging in luxuries. It's also about being prepared for the unexpected (repairs, health problems, disasters, whatever), being able to help others (charity, philanthropy), providing for your family (education), etc.
Your attitude towards materialism is healthy but in my humble opinion you can still treat the management of your paper wealth as a responsibility. I think a financial planner would be likely to advise you to at least rebalance your portfolio so all your eggs aren't in a single basket (BTC). I know the culture around here is all "HODL 100% BTC" memes but diversification is like wealth management 101.


The thing is… you don't actually have that knowledge. Nobody *knows* 100% that BTC will maintain its value forever. You can be bullish about BTC and continue to hold a large amount, but still be smart about mitigating risk.

Also, if you had that much power at your disposal, you'd stand far, far, far more to gain by simply mining them and legitimizing their value. Double-spending would be like killing the goose that lays the golden egg at that point.

This is actually one of the more interesting aspects to cryptocurrencies. In short, no.
Bitcoin is really just a big public ledger, distributed among a lot of computers. Transactions are recorded by taking the previous history, the current transaction, and running a very computationally intense (but meaningless) calculation to generate the next "step" in the chain. The result is designed to be very hard to produce, but easy to verify. And since each step depends on the accumulated history, nobody can go in and fake a transaction in the past (e.g. delete, modify, or add). In order to do that, you'd have to not only perform the calculation for that transaction, but every single following transaction — an insane and untenable amount of work. Nobody can solve all those equations fast enough to re-write the blockchain, which is constantly being added to.
Of course, someone needs motivation to perform these intense calculations (expensive wastes of electricity) — keeping the blockchain running. The obvious incentive is, why not make the system reward those who run the computations by giving them bitcoins. So this process is given the pithy name "mining."
Now, your next (or rather, original) question is undoubtedly… "why couldn't they make the calculations more useful? Like SETI or protein folding?"
People have looked into it, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any real-world computation problem that satisfies all the needs of BTC — being very expensive / difficult to reproduce, but easy to verify, based on previous data, iterable for new data, grows in difficulty over time, and various other cryptographic nuances.
Even worse, there is a legitimate concern that blockchain tech like this isn't at all free from an *environmental* perspective. You have massive amounts of energy going into what are essentially supercomputer farms. That power has to come from somewhere. The carbon footprint of BTC is non-trivial.

Common misconception. Anonymity was never an explicit goal of Bitcoin (decentralization, deflation, robustness, being “trust-less” etc. were). Bitcoin is pseudonymous – the ledger only holds wallet addresses, but is 100% public, and addresses can often be tracked to how they were funded (e.g. through an exchange’s records).

The value is cumulative, so it is strictly monotonic (never decreasing). Example for clarity:
Price | BTC @ Price | Cumulative BTC
$10k | 3 | 3
$11k | 1 | 4
$12k | 0 | 4
$13k | 2 | 6

Should I bet my life savings on black or red at the roulette wheel? What about horses, which one will win in the next race? Is it better to put quarters into the slot machine on Tuesday or Wednesday?
Investments are gambles. Nobody knows as a matter of _fact_ (though plenty of people have opinions) whether the value of something will go up or down. Investing is the act of making an educated bet. Guess what, you can lose bets! It's the nature of betting. Financial investments are only better than a casino because casino games are all statistically rigged against you, whereas investment opportunities can be statistically promising if you do your due diligence.
Most people here are of the opinion that bitcoin is a smart investment. Exactly ZERO of them know that for a fact. Research &amp; form your own opinion. And whatever you do, don't put all your assets into one extremely volatile class like cryptocurrencies.
