@_date: 2019-08-08 17:43:10
Lets be clear. You're not making an ach purchase of bitcoin. You're depositing funds into Gemini via ACH and then using deposited funds to buy bitcoin.
Yes, your deposited funds are immediately available in Gemini (fuck you Coinbase) for trading, and any btc you buy is available for immediate sale. 
However, you wont be able to withfraw the deposited funds, or the byc equivalent, until the ach has fully cleared.

I dont understand this. I use the Gemini exchange, and my deposits are instantly credited, even though the actual xfer can take 5 days. Is this not standard?
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:10:39
Trading Btc to Usd (and vice versa) is an instant transaction. Withdrawing btc or usd from Coinbase to your bank or snother wallet may take up to 13 days

How did you lose 50%? It only dropped about 1.5k over the lasr few days. At most you should have lost 10-13% assuming you bought at 12k. Or maybe I cant math.

Recently had a colleague refer to me with the same vitriol he usually reserves for runners.
"Shut up about Bitcoin already. Always with you it's 'bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin!' You sound like one of those damned marathoners, all you can talk about is how far you ran today, and what you're eating to prepare for tonight's run, and how great running is."
Not sure how I feel about this.

No, I was actually the FOMO in this story. Several years ago, I mined on Slush's Pool (pre-stratum days) and had ~22BTC. They sat in a wallet I had forgotten about until the 2013 spike, and I sold them @ 200USD. Didn't really have any faith the BTC would be a long-term survivor. 
Fast forward to Nov 2017, and I'm kicking myself. Can't realistically get back into mining at this point in the game.. so I bought some BTC 
Fast forward to now, where I'm kicking myself again?
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:36:00
I read the article. From my interpretation, they never even tried to touch your bitcoin. They just noted that you moved it off Coinbase, and called it money laundering. 
Nowhere in your article do you discuss how Bitcoin helped you, or how you were able to use Bitcoin to obtain goods or services while your fiat resources were seized.
Certainly you went through an ordeal, and I applaud you for getting through it without physically assaulting a government agent. I offer the highest respect to you for resolving the situation with most of your belongings intact.
But I have to wonder why this belongs in the Bitcoin subreddit.
