Lmao, if I would have just waited another year instead of 24yo me thinking that I made it big time. I didn't liquidate all of my holdings for it, but over 50% at that time.
But your right, I wouldn't trade the car now. Now it's built motor/ big turbo. She's a beast on the street. Part of that 20BTC went to building it to where it is now as well.

Better bring a shovel with you.

I spent 20BTC on my STI back when it was around 2k.... I love the car, but I would love to still have the BTC more.

@_date: 2019-11-26 18:18:06
For sure. You can never know. I was young and I got in around $200-$450 slowly. It jumped to 2K over the next 5 months. I didn't think it was sustainable, plus that money was burning a hole in my pocket for sure.

I'm sure he has many, many friends.

Lmao, come see me at VIR on the track and bring that 1 BTC. I'll come to Maryland Speedway too. 
Let me know what works for you. You're right. I've only pushed over 130MPH a few times because that's 5th gear, (Out of 6), and is technically an Overdrive gear and produces a lot of load. 
Also, 99% of the time the run is already over by the time I hit 5th.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:06:35
Definitely more a "Tuner" car IMO. I'm sure it will walk whatever shitbox he has.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:00:46
Really? Which ones? A Limited Edition STI is pretty luxurious on the inside if you haven't seen them. They retail at 45K. Also, it's the  car at holding its resale value.
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:43:16
To defend myself, All I can say is I will never be upside down on my car haha. I'll always get the USD out invested no matter what. Plus we all need depreciating assets, cars, and expenses.
Plus when BTC was 2K, the scene was a little different. It wasn't all about Lambo's and Moons. Most of us had already survived MT Gox and watch BTC go from $200 to $2000 in about a year, which was already unreal. You should use Bitcoin to buy things though.
Would I have kept it if I knew then what I know now? Definitely. But, I was able to buy and build a car I really wanted for about 10% of the cost if you really look at it.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:51:31
Horrible comparison.
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:58:19
Obviously you seem to care...
I bet it will run your car, if you even have one.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:19:16
One of the only cars I've ran that got me was a big turbo Evo 9. That dude was fast.  ������ 
Other than that I've killed an R8 in the quarter, and an M4 on the street. Respectable cars for sure and they thought I was joking trying to run. But afterwards, they were both super respectful and curious about the set up.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:19:40
Some people just don't understand.  ������
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:09:08
Hey man, before the STI I had a 2001 VR6 Jetta for a decade that I had to pay the homie to pass inspection! We've all been there! I just wasn't trying to shit on people that had better cars.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:03:05
"Run" according to Urban Dictionary.


@_date: 2019-11-26 18:07:42
Lmao, you think my car is stock horsepower with a built motor, big turbo? You must not be able to finish reading comments before replying. Come run it, 1BTC, or shut it.
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:32:04
I make a good bit of power for my weight. I wouldn't run the R8 now that he's tuned. He's in the low 10s now. I wish I was set up for road courses, my turbo is too big and takes a lot to spool. 
Good times though. Quick cars are fun, but expensive!
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:35:55
Wasn’t really an argument, just a statement. Really isn’t much more to argue then that... 
You’re average many reliable assets versus an extremely new type of asset.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:21:45
LMFAO, we're at the last resort here guys. We're pulling out the mom jokes. I'm done here. 
Go have your pity party by yourself.
@_date: 2019-11-26 19:23:19
Could have, should have, would have! At 20K it would have been worth a house, not to mention I sold before the bcash fork as well. Not like I like Bcash, but I would have sold it for sure.
I'll take it though. I'm grateful for what I have and the opportunity I had to make it possible in the first place.
I try to look at it as I got the car for about 6-7K instead of looking at it as what it could have been with perfect timing.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:36:46
I don't see how this happened. Out of all the early adopters, how did no one with good intentions grab the Bitcoin . com domain?
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:01:54
Just because you buy a domain doesn’t mean you have to use it

I didn't know Roger Ver was Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:57:41
I bought in the first time at $480 at the crash a little over a year ago but sold at $1200. Highly upset I didn't hold on to them longer. Thought I already made it big.
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:49:25
What is the size of the withdrawal? Also, since people are withdrawing for Proof of Keys they are probably trying to play it safe.
That doesn't make it okay though. If they want verification, request more verification. Don't just delay my stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:17:50
I really hope it does crash. I could use a good buy in.
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:41:52
Good catch. Unfortunately squatting domains is still huge. I wonder what Roger paid out for it.
@_date: 2019-12-10 00:40:17
Bruh, who the hell said it would expose fractal reserves? I know people have said such, but I didn’t.
Majority of people won’t move their BTC off the exchange... people are lazy.

The genesis block, which would be his own block. So even still the wording wouldn't make any sense because it's not the same block spitting out coins. It would just say, "back in my day I spit out 50 of you at once".

Shit, I had to get a SIM through Verizon and it was very difficult honestly.
