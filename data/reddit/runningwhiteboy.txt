You want pity for being stupid and not doing research prior to pretending you know how to invest properly, and you want a refund? Gtfo.

If you are looking to just day trade like that, I guess it would be fine. You won't have actual ownership of any coins though.

Bruh, 9020 is a drop from 9115.
You probably wanted to put 9015.
And in that case, you would have to calculate in the transaction fees both for buying and selling.

Fees paid for actually doing something, you don't say!

Can someone ELI5 me this please?

Don't use Robinhood! It's not a real investment in bitcoin.  You can't even spend your coins from there. No wallet, no keys, no coins. They could just pull some bs, you'll maybe get your USD back but the true investment of owning bitcoin will be gone.

The initial sync was unnecessarily slow for me as well. I ended up doing the initial on my computer and copying it over.

Best reply to this joke ever.  Now I got something new to figure out!

Still buying, I got my average cost down to almost 10k now.
