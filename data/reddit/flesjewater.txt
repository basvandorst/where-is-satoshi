This sounds like a really good idea. I already use Electrum, so a seed would be the best option then. Thanks!

I'm not a neuroscientist, so I have no idea. I read something about the body creating a certain hormone that causes hallucinations when it's about to die, that might have something to do with it.

Can you add Stochastic RSI and a horizontal screen orientation? I'd like to choose whether I have the actions menu on the top or bottom too.
Other than that it's simply great!

In the end consciousness is nothing but chemical reactions happening in the brain. It can't do that if it's frozen.

Could've bought an apartment without any mortgage at 20 years old. Ended up with almost enough to pay for driving lessons.
I regret selling so early, but don't blame myself. Hindsight is 20/20.

Yeah, getting blitzkrieg'd as a neutral country was totally our own fault. 
B. is just a fallacy. Are you going to compare an occupation on own soil, which has happened to **plenty** of countries in recent history, to BS events like that?
And what do you even mean by more peaceful? If anything the world is burning harder than it has in the last 10 years, Putin-West relations are at an all time low. I don't expect a Russian invasion per sé, but given that records are **absolutely indefinite** I'd still be cautious if I were you. Hell, I think I'd already be denied entry to the US like those folks that [posted a misinterpreted message on twitter](

Trias politica. Government has nothing to do with court institutions, at least not in the EU as far as I know.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:59:31
Browsing records last forever. Government administrations don't.
If in 50 years some totalitarian 1984-esque government takes over, you'll be the first to be strung up for thoughtcrime.
Think that's far-fetched? Think again. In the Netherlands, 1940, county administrations kept perfect record of all their citizens. Birth records, ethnicity, religion, address, everything. That sure saved the Nazis a lot of effort when they came rolling in.
@_date: 2014-09-01 06:40:00
Yeah, sure, the thieves get charged. But you still lost your shit which likely wouldn't have happened if you had a better lock. Therefore you still (at least partially) owe it to your own lack of security. Grow up.

They'll advise the CEO of course. But they don't make the final decision. The job of a CEO isn't to think of everything himself, but rather to weigh options and decide on that.
@_date: 2016-02-11 10:52:15
No - but pilots don't get to make the call on new plane acquisitions either. You think the CEO doesn't take engineer consensus into account?

Oh come on... In context of a post like this that's like saying you watch porn for the plot.

Financial value is by definition separate from what you value personally. I value my assets by what the market will pay for them like a sane person. Whether that's what the fiat market will pay for my btc or vice versa is a matter of semantics - holding through the crash made the total value of your portfolio shrink a ton no matter how you put it and that's what we call a net loss.
If you think bitcoin will go up much further, that's your speculation, but that's separate from value. You're only kidding yourself if you think holding through 2018 was a winning move.

@_date: 2019-01-29 16:41:18
No it is not. Crypto price doesn't define fiat price, I wish it would one day but right now that's a delusional thought. I price my net worth in dollars, not in apples. In context of trading 'I could've done better' is the same as 'I closed my short too late'. No, you made a conscious decision to hold on to your position and as a result your position is now worth less.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:59:23
No, but justifying your loss this way won't make you a better trader. Better suck it up and learn from it.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:40:04
In what world is it not a loss? If your investment could've bought a villa back then and only a normal apartment now? Again, at no point has OP locked in his money, he could've pulled out at any time. Please explain because I'm bewildered here.

In France they used gallows. I'm not advocating violence, those were barbaric times, but a revolution on that scale is long overdue. The US has become a full on banana republic at this point while pretending to still be a first world country IMO.
