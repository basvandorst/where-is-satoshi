the level of retardation in this thread is incredible. their own miners? miner contracts? have you read and understood anything at all about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:32:23
this is exactly the situation i was referring to. what do you do? not cash out time to time to buy groceries? get dinner? every time he needs to spend fiat from his job he will be taxed again. duh
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:14:54
have you noticed bitcoin withdrawal outages on gdax? three guesses as to why it's clogged and where those Tx's are going.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:19:04
No, because all your other shitcoins are priced in btc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:59:45
bitfinex is buying btc from legitimate exchanges worldwide so they can repay their customers who are trying to withdraw on a massive scale. they are running a fractional reserve/ponzi and need coins immediately.

No they don't. Any bank can refuse you service. Once they divulge their business and the amount of money coming in and out banks don't want to deal with it.

ledger nano requesting $15 tx fee on a segwit address. This will force everyone to use lightning. how do you feel about the majority of txs occurring off the block chain?
feels bad man.

@_date: 2017-11-12 16:35:12
lol it's just trading bots and whales it happens constantly on every exchange. it used to be thousands of btc back in the day. how long have you been trading anything at all? i'm sure coinbase will definitely get back to you :)))
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:23:51
of course.

@_date: 2017-11-27 10:37:15
actually less volume on gdax but anyones guess at this point. huge sell volume on bittrex. books are manipulated overnight, low volume gdax. bots making arbitrage trades, look at how thin the books are. much more sell volume on bittrex and bitfinex where asia is very much still awake and trading.

assuming bitfinex actually has enough btc for customers to withdraw, still doesn't take into account the amount of damage it would due to the overall btc economy and outlook, all psychological. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:56:52
implying single user nodes secure a network... not really, even at this point. and once transactions start happening off chain it's not even an issue anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:42:00
except it's used to buy bitcoin thereby getting us to its current valuation.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:20
now's the time to buy. you can't catch the bottom but you can get a discount. even if it goes to 3k... keep buying lower. it has made new ATH for the history of its existence

@_date: 2017-11-22 04:45:52
i'm not. if you're putting your life savings into bitcoin you're retarded. it's not just a savings account, not just a financial vehicle, not just a system of value transfer, it's all of those things sometimes at the same time. in the end it's simply a distributed ledger, we give it meaning outside of the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:16:35
there have been documented cases of scripts discovering private keys with english words and emptying them. obviously I think this is very unlikely that ledger would randomly generate a private key with a discoverable word so yeah probably a non issue.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:35:22
learn to play their game. the bots are there to help you, you will realize this eventually 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:47:40
why wouldn't you just use a wallet with a segwit address and specify your own low fees

use a decentralized cryptocurrency, then try to enlist help from centralized institutions to claim said cryptocurrency. that's rich

once bitcoin scales to lightning your tx will not even be on the blockchain. which would you prefer? want a full node just run a server. most people don't want to do that. a full node does not a secure network make. the majority of people who want to download the full blockchain would have to do that anyway with just 1MB blocks if btc were adopted worldwide 100% on a massive scale.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:30:12
jesus you can export a chart with proper lines on it so easily
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:09:19
Next time make sure you use payment ID.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:25:50
once bitfinex implodes you'll get another chance :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:52:47
you mean the same small group of people that controlled hash rate for btc right? the delusion here is staggering 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:33:44
copy. and when I just send USD to the exchange? sounds like if everyone wanted to withdraw coin at once they'd face the same problems a bank might. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:02:49
you're talking about a hypothetical in the very distant future. once you get to that point, and if bitcoin is still valuable, increasing block reward or switching to pos could be universally accepted. I think at that point they will have figured out this stuff or a different sha 256 protocol will stage an attack and become standard. That is what happens when you have immutable dogmatic founders of any belief system; another one comes along that fits the needs of the people, miners included. If you don't believe there is already an element of centralization in btc and even more so bcc right now you're just not right. 
don't flame me on this it's conjecture but seems probable far down the line. if and when quantum happens bitcoin pow would become insecure as well
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:42:49

you do realize bitfinex has a majority stake in tether right 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:10:44
as soon as the CFTC starts investigating bitfinex 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:08:13

Bitfinex being raided and tether evaporating. billions will be lost.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:35:12
not really sure wtf you're talking about. i just paid 2.50 for a tx and it was confirmed in minutes. i still think that's a lot but i generally pay a lot less
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:43:43
Developers and miners can certainly come to a consensus and change the protocol to allow more than 21 million coins. The idea is that they won't. Also, we don't know where Bitcoin will be by 2149. It may have overwhelming consensus to increase the block reward and coin cap. Unless there is massive worldwide adoption and the platonic ideal of decentralized mining with quantum computing, a 0 block reward becomes a real security issue.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:32:01

@_date: 2017-11-20 06:14:47
cool just sent 100k
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:55:56
this means that it's time to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:38:52
no, imagine what happens when bitfinex, who holds the majority stake in tether, is tied to a conspiracy to print fraudulent tethers to buy BTC. Bitfinex shuts down and all the money that was created to pump bitcoin was a fallacy. everyone who holds btc on bitfinex is at stake and begins to sell or run. panic, like a bank run.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:08:32
i figured, does that mean by just entering a $.01 market order they can support the price without paying a fee?
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:38:15
people sell their coins at ath, yeah, super low
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:02:29
thanks. could you help me understand how an exchange settles bitcoin transactions then? You say they happen 'off chain'. how do they acquire and disperse btc then when you make transactions or withdraw to another wallet? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:32:48
most don't believe this, including most ardent long term supporters and early adopters.

it's just a wallet address. getting loaded up heavily since dip began. also watch entire 200btc buy walls getting filled... no one is pulling those orders.  make up your own narrative :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:23:32
but on which chain will normal buyers be buying and selling on? as they buy coinbase s2x coins BTC1 may be btfo, flash crash. Whales will accumulate, s2x will crash. coinbase users will sell to avoid loss. Chaos, fud, thisisfineverythingisfine.jpg
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:53:22
You can actually get the recovery phrase from blockchain.info and import it into a bip generator and get your private keys. Now, supposedly you could retrieve your bcash with this method. I want you warn you however that I did this and every bcash wallet gave me an error saying the blockchain wallet was empty, so YMMV. Move your money to a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:04:24
they will fall in line. i think every player was waiting to hear from coinbase. b2x is dead now. sell your free coins next month

@_date: 2017-10-11 19:10:52
short answer no
long answer: if you sell before the chain forks you get nothing. if you keep it on coinbase, coinbase will likely never allow you access to bitcoin gold. they will also only follow the chain that becomes dominant and will not allow you to access the old coin.
