"It creates a bargaining situation in which the delivery of the product has no (economic) effect on the bargaining positions."
The seller puts up a deposit equal to the price of the item which they can loose if the buyer doesn't sign a refund. You might say they'll just then tell the buyer to make the payment so they get their deposit back, but as long as more than 50% will act punitively and not do so (see  ), then this form of fraud will simply result in the fraudster going bankrupt.
"2of3 ...can only steal funds by colluding with one of the two trading parties" 
Please see the slides on proxy attacks. You have no way of knowing whether or not those "two" parties are the same entity. Also, the arbitrator has no means of fairly deciding who is lying in a dispute as only the buyer and seller know what was or was not sent.

We're working on the Linux and Windows ports (using GNUstep so we only need one code base).

Hi token_dave, It sounds like you might have missed that the buyer puts up 2x the price of the item. 1x for the item, and 1x for the deposit. So if they commit fraud, they loose their deposit and if they do not, they get it back. They can only loose money by committing fraud.

There's no option in the client for anything expect full payment or full refund. There's also no means for buyer and seller communication besides sending the delivery address. Remember that in the Ultimatum Game, no communication or negotiation was allowed.

Thanks skemez1. Emailing us might be the best way to reach us.

Hey guys, we're the creators of BitMarkets.
It's an anonymous decentralized market based on two party mutual security deposit escrow, fully peer to peer (no central servers), no fees, no middle men, no altcoin, built on bitmessage and bitcoin, open protocol and source,
working today.
white paper: 
We'd be happy to answer any questions and hear your thoughts on it.
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:08:01
I've pushed a likely fix with version 0.9.1.1. Can you give it a try and let me know if it works for you? 
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:49:58


I haven't heard you make an argument for this. Once the escrow is signed, neither party can profit from defrauding the other assuming both parties are willing to act punitively. And we can expect that they will based on the results of the Ultimatum Game experiments.
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:53:13
We don't. This is free open source software based on top of the decentralized bitcoin and bitmessage networks. We don't own or run the networks on which the market runs, the users do.
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:53:49
Yes, but to be fair, OB1 and OpenBazaar are related but separate projects.

Thanks for the bug report. Can you tell me which version of OSX you're using? I'll try to repeat it - it's been I while since I installed Java.

Reputation failures are also addressed in the slides. Btw, how does an arbiter build a reputation that means anything if it has no real means of determining who is telling the truth in a dispute? Do they just get upvotes from the people who they decide in favor of, down votes from the others, and upvotes from both when there is no dispute? A coin flipping "arbiter" could do as well as any other in such a system.

Yes, Gregory Casamento, the lead of the GNUstep project is working on the port. With GNUstep we'll be able to support OSX, Windows and Linux with a single code base.

You might find the slides helpful in understanding our choice there:
Two party escrow ensures neither party can profit from fraud. Any repeated bad actors will go bankrupt. 
Compare this to 2of3 escrow markets where we see fraudsters making millions off of one exit scam after another.
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:51:41
That's right - the seller puts up 1x and the buyer puts up 2x (1x for the item and 1x for a deposit).
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:24:47
There are other markets using 2of3 and they, unfortunately, keep getting exit scammed. Tens of millions have been lost to these scams and I see no reason why this won't continue until we move to 2of2.
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:15:42
Yes, but that's all the more reason *not* to act punitively as the other person has caused no harm, has not lied and has technically committed no crime. 
The fact that people would be willing to give up a month's salary to punish such people for simply acting "unfairly" is beyond remarkable.

3rd party arbitration is impossible as the arbitrator has no means of determining who is lying. A shipping receipt is nota proof that the particular item was sent or is in working order, etc.

Yes, Bitmarkets was inspired by NashX though NashX used 2of3 and not 2of2 escrow.
Both sides putting up a deposit is something new for people to get used to. But it 
1) makes it impossible for anyone to profitably defraud them 
2) makes fair resolution of a dispute possible. This is not the case with an escrow agent as they have no means of determining who is lying. At best they can only toss a coin.
@_date: 2015-10-23 02:00:14
We're working on it.

The Ultimatum Game experiments suggest the large majority of people will act punitively when amounts are less than one month's wages:

In the situation you describe, the seller is risking 2x the price in order to potentially gain ~10%. In order for them to think that would pay off on average, they would have to estimate that fewer than 1 in 20 people would act putatively. Would you take that bet?
@_date: 2015-10-23 02:02:23
The structure also provides a strong incentive not to misrepresent a product. A seller that tries to pass of a used xbox as a new one risks loosing both the xbox and their security deposit if the buyer feels they were defrauded. What seller would take that risk?
