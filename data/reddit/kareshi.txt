Cryptography is actually very similar to Bitcoin: mathematicians are constantly mining to break currently strong cryptographic primitives, but when they are close, the "difficulty" is raised and the process continue.
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:02:07
Displaying Bitcoin as a coin everywhere is not dumb at all, but for its denomination we need to choose something smart and geeky so dumb people will not use it - way to go.
@_date: 2014-09-03 18:22:54
Well, exponential growth of the Bitcoin kinda helps. Give it a time.

Another video (he talks in English there): 
Why he looks so happy?
@_date: 2014-08-29 14:19:47
He was a successful man that greatly supported the existing system. For that he was appreciated and rewarded by that system - for most people that's more than enough. No one thinks too much about their actions and even if they do, they always find the rational justification for their actions, that's how our psychology works. No one lives and dies in vain. We can judge someone and say such things, but that's only our judgements. Everyone just tries to realize their potential. How it works out for others, no one can predict for sure.

First steps in growing up:
1. Invest in BTC what you want to save.
2. Learn to hold - never sell cheaper than you bought.
You see, it's that simple and it worked from the day Bitcoin was created. 
There was and will be a lot of FUD, provocations, threats. But, the effective weapon is very simple: 1 and 2. Stop fighting with each other - fight with the system until it's not too late.

I think, we could use "coin" instead. It's already has a meaning connected with money and it's more preferable to have a coin that just some bit.
Why we make the same mistakes one after another: Namecoin instead of Bitdns (as Satoshi suggested), bit instead of coin?
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:21:05
The good news are that we are already several steps ahead than a majority.

It's not very good news, so the price should go up, right?
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:08:41
Just try it, it will work
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:49:33
The transaction is distributed on average across the whole network in 12 seconds. It's very fast and it should be utilized to prevent a double spend. The nodes can come to consensus about transaction time that is much more accurate than 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 18:19:53
This is the best short explanation of Bitcoin I heard.
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:44:42

TIL I am dumb. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 22:22:43
Good lord. Well, I will explain it like you are 5. There can be two types of inflation:
1. Fair inflation. In this case you distribute newly created currency evenly between all users of the currency. But, what is the point of doing this? Everybody will have the same quantity of currency in relation to each other - the result is the higher prices and more savings. Imagine, all prices now would increase 10 times and at the same time everybody's savings increased also in 10 times. What would be changed? Nothing. It would be just more complex system with no purpose whatsoever.
2. Unfair inflation. This is an inflation that is currently in existence. And the ONLY reason it exists, because the new currency is received by very limited powerful people (effectively by stealing from others). They enforce existence of this system, because, obviously it's very beneficial for them. The whole economic theories has been created to serve just this purpose.
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:50:52
1. Bitcoin IS a network. And he just meant: "According to Bitcoin network". 
2. For all we know, things like Bitcoin in the future may be referenced as decentralized companies.
@_date: 2014-09-10 20:36:57
This. It seems like it's passive and unproductive, but it is one of the best way to support growth of the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:06:41
We can buy more when price is falling. Also, big Bitcoin investors should buy to prevent the falling - it's in their interest. Bitcoin is always stable, we are not. The price in USD fails because of someone's propaganda that USD is better than BTC, that's all.
@_date: 2014-08-06 12:31:26
It's not obvious. Imagine, there's only one miner and thousands of other non-mining nodes. If someone sends a transaction, what is the benefit of transmitting it through other nodes versus submitting it directly to the miner? 
@_date: 2014-09-29 11:35:53
No, no way! Are you sure you wasn't dreaming?
@_date: 2014-08-13 19:25:11
They do everything right trying to raise as much as possible. We are the ones who invest more than necessary.
@_date: 2014-11-01 11:34:25

@_date: 2014-08-04 22:35:53
Nah, it's good. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 08:13:08
No, he still can spend newly sent bitcoins. Only initial 50 BTC cannot be spent. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:46:41
This is obviously not true. You pay fees every time you buy anything with your credit card, along with the business owner. You pay fees every time you pay with cash, subsidizing credit cards users and merchants. Everybody always pays fees, except banks - they take the fees. You pay - they take. It's amazing how easy is to hide this simple fact from people.

@_date: 2014-09-21 13:32:38
Bitcoin protects you from the government's racket which forces you to spend on things you don't need or just takes money from you through money counterfeiting (aka "inflation").
Spending less and saving more is a very natural and sensible thing to do, now you have a freedom to do that.
This feature of Bitcoin is a very good reason to fully adopt Bitcoin. If you take other features into consideration - the adoption is practically guaranteed.
@_date: 2014-09-08 10:19:24
No one knows, but If you buy, you will increase the possibility that the price will grow.
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:51:06

It indeed sounds like it is an ideal system. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 13:22:06

Those who bought a year ago now have 300% profit.
EDIT: if you bought 9 months ago, you knew it was risky to buy at ATH price and wouldn't spend too much money. It may take more time to be profitable. Even if you can't sell it right now with the profit, you still can benefit later and most importantly you supported Bitcoin by investing in it, which is much better than supporting the current financial system which will fuck you hard in the future. But everyone is impatient and wants the Moon right now.
If you wasn't a certified investor, you couldn't buy shares of such prosperous companies as Microsoft, Facebook or Twitter until their IPO. Now, you can buy shares of Bitcoin. So, just do it. If it's cheaper - great, buy more.

1. Earth - the whole world. 
2. You know... 
@_date: 2014-09-21 13:09:08
That's totally wrong. Businesses should demand Bitcoin from their customres and give nice discounts to get bitcoins. Customers should spend bitcoins only if it's a really great deal. First Bitcoin killer app was right there from the beginning - it's holding. It is very simple app and it works. For now, we beg busineses to take our bitcoins as if it's some garbage that we want to get rid of. With this attitude the price will continue to fall.

Agree. Those who are panic selling now - they are not  true investors or supporters of Bitcoin, they are selling at a loss (thus ironically supporting Bitcoin anyway) and shouldn't have bought it in the first place. Eventually, Bitcoin will grow and whoever supported it, will get a fair reward for that. It's that simple.

@_date: 2014-08-31 12:42:25
The point is not to change the name, but to introduce a new simple unit of account that avoids zeroes and is not cumbersome for people. It can be "coin" or "bit". 
In fact, "dollar" is a Russian word (доля) and it means "portion" (share, part, fraction). "Bit" has a similar meaning, so there is some logic there to use "bit".
Edit: I a mathematician, non-American and I also think that mili, micro are too cumbersome. Money should be easy, no reason to bring science here.

It's not wiser - it's gambling. Instead of consolidating and supporting Bitcoin, we are trying to game each other instead of fighting Dollar. The result - Bitcoin will die, Dollar win. The irony is that we were fighting against greedy bankers and will fall because of our own greediness. This is very sad.
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:08:04

@_date: 2014-11-06 13:55:20
I must say that at this point mining isn't supportive but is HARMFUL to the Bitcoin, because you are burning your money for nothing instead of investing it in something useful.
If you really want to support the network, just buy bitcoins. Many Bitcoin startups hold their funds in bitcoins and by buying bitcoins you support them. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:55:26
Yeah, antifragility in action. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:48:52
But they are lazy and wouldn't know or buy bitcoins back then. And opposite is true - when you have some small amount of bitcoins you wouldn't bother to sell them unless they grow in value.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:09:50
Most of the people doesn't know or understand Bitcoin. Therefore are afraid it can go to 0. USD and EUR are very common for storing value. In fact, it's very hard to buy them in the crisis like this. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:21:18
As a non-native English speaker, I hate it as well. It just doesn't sound right. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:55:48

In the mean time, holding in Blockchain.info wallet should be OK.
@_date: 2014-10-20 09:12:01
Many people are actually afraid of success. They got used to hard inefficient ways of doing things. And when one time they do the right thing, it may feel that they are still doing it wrong and there is a catch somewhere.
Your intuition tells you: Bitcoin's rise is inevitable. Follow it. By buying bitcoins you take not just financial position but a political one. 
If you want to make a difference you just have to take risks. When you vote  on elections - you don't take risks and you don't make a difference. 
You shouldn't store 100% in Bitcoin, though, be sensible.
@_date: 2014-11-08 11:45:18
You should pay with Bitcoin only if you already have it and there is a discount for Bitcoin purchases. That way, using credit cards would be more expensive.  
@_date: 2014-08-28 21:13:41
It's easy: when miners stop selling their bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-07-20 17:28:32
No propaganda is correct - it's just a mechanism for one group of people to push their interests and to create an illusion that their agenda is better than everything else. If we make Bitcoin ecosystem better than fiat, and show this to everyone, then fiat will go away. If we don't - it's our fault that we couldn't push the technology that just allows us to have control on our own money.
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:20:51
Maybe, some small fees could be distributed from each block to the Bitcoin holders for providing time services. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 22:38:52
Yeah, after the recent price drop, I knew it was just some big good news.
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:41:51

There will be blood in the streets before Bitcoin is adopted. Unfortunately, there is no another way. Ukraine is first, others will follow soon. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:38:51
What a surprise! Who would have thought they could do that?
@_date: 2014-10-13 19:58:20
Good try, Peter. But no, you are not gonna get bitcoins at $300.
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:32:57
To all holders through deflation.

It is boring. I am glad Gavin's prediction comes into reality so soon.
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:37:42
You are genious 
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:51:59
But I do. I am confused now) 
@_date: 2014-09-21 13:14:56
I hope that will not see the demand because anyone who wants to pay in Bitcoin just switches to other companies which take bitcoins and give you a discount.
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:04:03
Maybe proof of stake could be used for this?
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:29:39
No worry, its just redistribution of bitcoins and shaking weak hands - business as usual. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 17:45:22
There is also proof of burn. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:39:53
Honestly, no.

I wish there were more ads like this.

Sure, some will start buying instead of mining - price will go up and they will start mining again.
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:35:22
Use IPTorrents instead.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:59:35
That's because traders think they can trade instead of just being a VC supporting Bitcoin. Winning side, of course, are always big whales.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:06:39
Couldn't agree more with you: it has been already life changing for a lot of people.

I bought BTC with the credit card. I can't believe it.
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:11:43
I generally agree, but gram can be used without any prefixes - it already has a defined quantity. Coin can work the same way. The only question is to choose a correct quantity for one coin.

Double-spend is a problem and it it could be solved more efficiently and reliably if there was a time-stamp for each transaction (realized by additional consensus mechanism). 
Currently the block solves two problems: 
- saving history of transactions (work fine);
- preventing double-spend (works poorly);
There is no reason to solve two different problems with one nail.
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:13:03
Yeah, If only there was a way for the Bitcoin protocol to evolve...
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:58:42
Wow, sounds cool! Any bits for me?
@_date: 2014-02-02 10:08:58
What's your criteria for bitcoin's price affordability?
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:35:02
But the CEO of Bitcoin really likes to play with rather expensive mining hardware.
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:23:39
And no moon, it's so frustrating. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:44:41
I've figured it out - we need merchants that hoard bitcoins as much as possible.
@_date: 2014-08-20 22:38:54
No one will accept dollars after 2016.

Blocks work well. That doesn't mean that it cannot be improved with addition of other security layers. It can and it should.
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:04:37
Maybe, proof of stake could work for this particular problem. So, people without mining power could at least add some protection layer for the double-spend problem.
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:35:16
He's already deeply involved. So, at least he should benefit from it!
@_date: 2014-09-05 17:12:05
He did the hard part. Our responsibility is just to deliver it..  you know where to.

But you have to admit that receiving JLaw pics is much more exciting than receiving some bits. We need something in the middle.

The most important bit and what I always said:
BM: What do you think is the greatest threat to Bitcoin?
BL: Great question, thank you for giving me an opportunity to answer this.
Bitcoin is what people want to make of it. And I think the greatest threat to Bitcoin is apathy. If people, I mean broadly people, humanity, if they give up on Bitcoin then Bitcoin will die. That’s what it comes down to. If we give up, if we as human people, as citizens of the world, if we individually or collectively as a group give up on Bitcoin then Bitcoin will die. Period. And that’s at the most core.
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:37:17
This is history
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:14:18
You are very positive person.
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:44:59
Don't worry, soon shit will hit the fan in a lot of other countries, so you'll not be bored.
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:46:27
Or construct a decentralized one. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:00:00
Bitcoin is also used by terrorists and by drug dealers, not even mentioning child porn.
But, seriously, for me Bitcoin is stable enough - my local currency lost almost 50% of value for the last half a year and you cannot trust banks to store your money, and there are limited possibilities to buy USD. Just remember that US is not the only country and Bitcoin was created for the whole world.
@_date: 2014-08-13 17:18:33
Yeah, If we want bitcoin price to grow, we should hold our bitcoins, not to send them to every project in existence that takes them.
@_date: 2014-09-03 00:06:35
That was the reason why I stopped watching their show.
@_date: 2014-09-05 13:33:42
Imagine several DACs negotiating with each other, making deals, sometimes going to war with each other, hiring military forces, wait... we are back where we were.

@_date: 2014-08-24 23:46:32
Why to call it UltraCoin if it's not the coin and it is not an alternative to the Bitcoin? This is nonsense.
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:36:23
He told us, so don't complain later if you miss out.
@_date: 2014-07-31 22:04:52
Yes, and tell us how it will work out. Ganbatte! 
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:34:55
You forget about numerous "developing" countries and their local currencies going to zero. In those places people see Bitcoin safer than their local currency. Source: I live in Ukraine.
And no, you can't easily buy dollars here. Recently, a directive was passed that forces all exporters to sell 100% of the foreign currency to the state for gryvnya.

If people invested more than they could afford to lose, the Bitcoin would grow faster and they wouldn't lose anything.
@_date: 2014-10-21 09:35:05
Exactly. It's so bad, people can't even believe it. Even 0% inflation would be very bad, because with all the progress we have in technology there should be strong deflation.
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:31:41
With BTC-e you could buy bitcoins instantly if you are customer of Privat bank (most popular bank in Ukraine)

@_date: 2014-10-14 08:02:25
Yeah, and having 50 BTC doesn't help much.
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:50:21
People don't value it until they completely lose it.

US government continues seizing every bitcoin they can lay their hands on. First, Silk Road, now MTGox. They know what's up. The winter for USD is coming. Hold on to your bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:48:52
They will shake the market until they get the majority of all bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-14 16:15:27
weaknesses is a very light word, I would say
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:49:37
That's great, now is the time for non-traders to buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 09:13:36
The point is not what YOU want, but how others perceive what you want. We should stay calm and let merchants take their time and start fighting for our bitcoins. We never should spend our bitcoins unless there is a big discount or it is particularly convenient in the concrete situation.
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:33:46
No one will admit it, of course, but we are at war with the current financial system. The weaker it becomes - the better for Bitcoin. They attack Bitcoin by spreading FUD and trying to "regulate" it. We need to think not only about how to develop Bitcoin technology, but also how to attack the current financial system. Every their failure is an opportunity for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-09 09:33:47
I agree. I read it hoping to find real arguments about weaknesses of Bitcoin. But only found that for someone Bitcoin isn't growing fast enough, which is just ridiculous thing to say.
@_date: 2014-08-29 15:48:15
Why wouldn't they? It's not that you ask them to give You something - you ask them to Take something from you. We should be very surprised that someone doesn't take bitcoins for donations.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:15:07
That's how Bitcoin works!
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:13:27
Silicon Valley investors are waiting until their Bitcoin businesses are ready to serve customers. Until then they don't want any boom because their potential customers would go to other, less professional companies and fuck-ups like MtGox will happen. Of course such events would have a bad influence on Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related companies. 
So, the current strategy for investors - don't rush things, they already go very fast. That's the reason they say things like: "I invested only in Bitcoin companies, not bitcoins itself", "Bitcoin is not a threat to national currencies and they can co-exist".
But, when the time is right, they will launch an incredible advertisement company and the boom will happen.
@_date: 2014-08-31 21:48:51
No, it's a common knowledge for a long time. Watch Max Kaiser's show.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:37:26
It is. But, 100 grand - another story. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 00:20:01
So, is there any help to the network if you don't actually mine? Or you are hurting it because now the network is more cluttered and it takes more time for the transaction to go through all pseudo-nodes to get to the real ones - the ones who mine.
@_date: 2014-09-19 20:19:58
It was a solid advice though. If more people followed it, the price would be $10000 now.
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:45:08
The great music did the trick! 
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:22:44
Or 10000. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:58:15
It may turn out to be the best diversification strategy.
@_date: 2015-07-13 11:52:20
Why the price is falling again? 
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:34:10
Someone had to say it. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:06:51
But, but, I thought... never mind. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:02:27

Gold is created when two stars collide with each other. That is enormous energy - much bigger than any distributed network on Earth can produce. So, it's indeed very reliable and impossible to counterfeit.
Gold is much more universal as it is likely to be accepted by other creatures in the Universe, Bitcoin - is local to the Earth. Also, gold will be accepted after apocalypse, Bitcoin will not.
