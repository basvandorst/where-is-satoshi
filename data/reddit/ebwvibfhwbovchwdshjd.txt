This is big. Even Hal Finney suggested Bitcoin will eventually be a back-end currency and will facilitate new "banks" which will be custodians of one's bitcoins and allow for transactions taking place off chain. 
It is an unlikely player in this field, but an extremely potent one, since Square is a merchant POS system (as in - point of sale). 
Square essentially has the "rails" in place for allowing millions of business to accept Bitcoin with "one click". This process will have no learning curve for the business and will require no work (or even be aware) from their side.

it is as safe as giving any company your ID - Coinbase, Gemini, Circle, Uphold. All of these are well known companies with seed investments from top tier investors and with known founders. 
So the answer is - YES.

It seems every btc debit card has exactly the same conversion fee. I actually check. But OneBit seems to be changing this: 
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:16:36
How do U know this is from Asia? 
Didn't even know Gemini operates in the east. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:34:19
I don't know if they raised money or whatnot, but we should all donate to this amazing project!!! Thanks Bitsquare.

That's true. This sub is more of a cheerleader team. Of girls.

It's a mind job, but not coherent. No circle. No conclusion. He just bombs you with facts. Which is ok, I guess. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:41:27
I'd wait for $800. Anyone's guess though 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:59:45
Margin Trading allows a client to make a bet which is 3x his actual btc worth? 
So if I have 1BTC at GDAX, I can gamble with 3BTC? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:35:44
Very informative! Thank you for taking the time to write this. 
I I may: So is 1 = BU and 2 = Core? 
Or am I mixing things up here? 
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:22:56
It actually is a sign. A sign of falling decaying institutions that people are sick of. Good luck!

For this idiots among us (so me, basically): so this vid is showing a successful transaction taking place on the LN network (off-chain or off-block)? 
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:59:13
On top of that (same issue here - between one Coinbase user to another), getting weird split address: any clue why?
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:27:17
Very very cool! Thank you
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:36:48
that's true. can't think of now though. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 20:45:22
Good feeling about these guys in the long run...
@_date: 2017-01-17 20:49:07
Good call!

clueless: if segwit2x splits, will bitcoin (not the segwit2x-coin) have segwit as well? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:10:38
That's amazing customer service from Gemini. Time and again they prove to be 1st in the industry. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:02:45
Crazy how outdated this is. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 20:45:58
I wonder if anyone can comment about their app - secure to store btc?

*"we are currently working on a technical implementation for a one-time withdrawal of BCC for our customers"*
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:03:35
Someone offered to do a reset to the app. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:30:32
Gemini. By far. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:58:40
Hi. Sorry to hear this. Really. Can you explain how TeamViewer alone compromised your device? So I assume it was running without you knowing about it, and once you logged in to LastPass they literally saw your seed? Is this what happened? Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:14:09
Interesting. If you will that's really great of them, since they might say your bitcoin was not yet held by them. Interesting. Would be nice if you'll update on this. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:12:58
but what about seeing the tech in action? when will we "feel" it? 
@_date: 2016-12-19 13:54:03
They do require your SSN though
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:20:06
This one is really good:

haha :)
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:50:15


hahaha true (:
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:22:21
Isn't that expensive? Circle did not charge any fee for this. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:30:19
Very true. Not sure what their real reasons for closing this operation. Perhaps they were losing money. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:33:08
great job!!!! every one of us is the advertisment for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:31:37
Absolutely not! 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:32:21


Oh. Did not know this. Ok then. That's something at least. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:31:48
They accept cell phone bill. Worth a try. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:53:38
the same interest-driven ppl who run them now. they will make $ from validation

What about Xapo for buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:53:32

Don't spend it. Keep it. It will teach you a lot in life. Learn what it means to hold your funds and to be patient. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:50:35
I actually thought about this. This startup is dead IMHO. No one needs another wallet app. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:54:38
Can U screenshot this? 
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:41:34
What about a company named Uphold? 
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:24:05
The problem I have with bitsquare is to purchase small amounts fast. I wish they will succeed tough. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:53:35
In their email notifying users they say *"Our new focus is on this next-gen blockchain technology, rather than bitcoin."*. 
What is the next-gen block tech???
@_date: 2016-11-14 11:58:42
What does that mean? If tomorrow the US says no merchant is allowed to accept bitcoin, what is left?
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:31:22
tldr: what service (company) did he use to accept btc? bitpay? 
update: 
They are using Coinify through Payssion for those who are interested. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 14:26:17
This is good to know. Important too. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:21:30


pardon me, but what does this mean? slow to move on the network? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:13:28
This is HUGE. In fact, it outshines Coinbase in terms of how easy and available this is! 
These are the biggest news perhaps this year in terms of user-adoption possibility. 
Here is the app in action: 
And here is the app available to download: 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:46:11
u can think of miners as validators. they validate blocks, and so update the ledger. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:40:20
Which app is this? Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:19:05
You are missing the point. 95% of adoption of the general public will be from users who will NEVER hold their PK. If Bitcoin's adoption needs to happen by users holding their PK, adoption will never happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:36:52
This is how bitcoin goes mainstream.

LBC does this function? How? Do U happen to have a link for me? Thank you 
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:55:30


Thanks for that. I am learning. I was under the impression that POS does not allocated more voting power based on amount held. Just on holding in general. Are you sure this is the case? 
(you are probably way more informed than me - just curious about this point though)
thanks! 
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:10:14
but how do I post my wishlist? I don't see such option to look for specifically for these, so how will someone which is willing to do this find my listing?

He makes a solid point. We still have no clue how the govt will react to serious adoption or usage.

What OS? Thank you. Sorry for your coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:45:30
Pardon my ignorance, but this is impressive compared to what? What was it before segwit? Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:27:12
Curious here: can't the job of serving "these" people move to other chains (litecoin, bitcoin cash, eth, or even IOTA)? 
Is this a problem?

You mean via ZKCP? Or on Bitcoin itself? Doen't ZKCP contains all the logic off-chain? Can't this be seen as both a positive (privacy) but also negative (since any defect in the logic will be hidden from visibility to the rest of the community since it's off-chain)?
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:34:31
Sorry to jump in, but isn't the "bitcoin-competitor" actually see the fact that the transaction is done on-chain as a benefit? 
@_date: 2016-10-16 12:36:21

They don't ask you to do this.

since this device is more expensive than the Ledger, what makes one choose this over the Nano S? Curious.

Make sure U give them your litecoin address though (and also - in case transaction fails - your refund address (this would be your btc address that you send from)
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:50:14
It's so f'd up that U literally feel U have the name Ethereum "number2". not your fault. This sub is a cult. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:00:52
How do you deal with a lost/broken phone though?
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:38:08
I am very sorry for your loss here. Which OS if I may ask? 
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:12:19
but again - this just takes us back to Authy - which allows for backups. And is free. Unless I am missing something. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:38:19
So LastPass Authenticator is also good in that regard? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:23:26
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:25:03
It is illegal to deny you of electricity under state laws. Contact a lawyer about this!

i was under the impression macos is bulletproof.  how on earth did such a malware got to your mac? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:14:07
ohhh. So **Google Auth**, **Auth+** and **LastPass Auth** are NOT tied to your phone number - which is a plus. 
But Authy is - which is less secure. 
Good point! Thanks for clarifying!!! 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:37:16
THIS is a beginning. The uncoupling. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:14:18
authenticator plus? it was linked above...
