Sitting on a 980 but would like to upgrade for better FPS at 1440p and in (future versions of) VR.    
Gonna try and wait it out for proof-of-work crypto to blow over first.

Not selling but I am trying to send out of coinbase to a wallet.     
Gonna be waiting a while for it to clear I think.

I'm not selling, but I am trying to take about 0.1BTC out of Coinbase into a wallet. I think I'm gonna be waiting a little while for it to clear...

Still climbing. I think I'll check it in the morning.     
At least my ETH went through. Seems like the cryptokitty thing has calmed a little.

So anyone who doesn't believe that the One True Coin is perfect and has no issues is a troll?

Ah well. Such is life when you hodl.     
I cashed out my initial investment a few months back so I can never lose out. Left the rest in there.     
Just keep my arms inside the car and hold on for the ride.

ELI5 what happens if a hardware wallet breaks or a software wallet is on a device that dies? Can you "back up" a wallet?

Bought in today. Train seems to keep going, might as well have a little bit of cargo on it.
