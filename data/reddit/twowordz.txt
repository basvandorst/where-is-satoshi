I've noticed that they always announce new funds when bitcoin price is up.

haha I can feel the excitement.

I really don't care who it is. I'm just saying we should assume everyone is innocent until they are proven guilty.  
You wrongfully assume I use drugs and love bitcoin too. What else are you wrong about?
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:03:16
I'm selling my GTI for bitcoins in Ontario... :)
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:43:47
How about innocent until proven guilty?
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:39:32
I think you have step 1 and 2 backwards, we can't buy guns here.

the ephemeral private key bit values, but they are not clustered but in positions spread through the length of
the ephemeral private key.   
As a result, we only obtain for each signature a few (maybe only one) consecutive
bits of the ECDSA ephemeral private key, and so the technique described in [25] does not appear at ﬁrst
sight to be instantly applicable. The main contribution of this work is to combine and adapt the FLUSH+
RELOAD attack and the lattice techniques. The FLUSH+RELOAD attack is reﬁned to optimise the proportion
of information which can be obtained, then the lattice techniques are adapted to utilise the information in
the acquired in an optimal manner. The result is that we are able to reconstruct secret keys for 256 bit elliptic
curves with high probability, and low work effort, after obtaining less than 256 signatures.  
  
That sounds scary.  
  


times a private key is used within the Bitcoin protocol. Each wallet corresponds to a public/private key pair,
so this essentially limits the number of times one can spend from a given wallet. Thus, by creating a chain
of wallets and transferring Bitcoins from one wallet to the next it is easy to limit the number of signing
operations carried out by a single private key

You could be right but there is no **obvious** evidence that they stole the funds.  
In reality, you don't know shit.  
Maybe they figure that it will be more profitable to make money on the transaction fees in the long run.  
The evidence of this *is actually obvious* since they are refunding people using transaction fees and it took them only a few months to do so.

They would pay a set fee outside of the exchange automated billing process. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:41:49
That's my kind of bet.  
I would think that the odds of bitcoin reaching $100 are better than reaching $1000 though.

My point is there are still people buying, I still believe that it could go big and I remember that what I have invested in bitcoin, I can afford to lose and the gamble is the same as the first day.

ElGreatScott is using Controversial's record as a measure of his credibility which in my opinion is *fair* and would not constitute an Ad Hominem attack.

I bought more coins when SR went down now with this run up, I think we will see the same as last time when it went up to $280, people will start cashing out and it might lead to panic sell. I'm hoping to get back in around $120. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:51:52
I'm trading on cavirtex, which was stable around $122-128 before the uptrend. Sorry about the confusion.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:43:20
Thanks. I already have an account, I read their FAQ but I couldn't find how the payment works. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:35:22
Honestly, fuck memes.
@_date: 2013-06-10 12:26:49
You make a good point.  
The issue right now is that is(was?) one of the most visited subreddit and there are people with with a stake in bitcoin that could benefit from swaying other people's opinion one way or another.  
I am not saying it's the case here but I feel there is a bit of a negative about feel OP's post.
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:32:08
No, but the change might go to a new address depending on your bitcoin client configuration.

Isn't it 1% now on virtex?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:42:04
I was stuck in a meeting all day. I checked my phone a couple of times and saw BTC drop to $130 on cavirtex and I though holy shit I have to sell, then I was thinking no... the fundamentals are the same as yesterday... I have to buy more BTC to improve my position, the market is going to bounce back... I just got out of there and now it's back at $220... Missed opportunity!

I mean, how are you getting paid, as a shareholder?
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:42:27
I was wondering if you provide them an address where they can send the dividends. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:52:51
Damn right, I sold all my coins last week and I'm just waiting for people to cash out to buy again.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:08:36
With bitcoin's popularity, it won't take long before this sub becomes just a series of stupid memes, screenshots and DAE posts...
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:01:13
you can buy it as an investment and don't believe it will overtake the US as the main currency...
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:22:38
No way.

Half the cost of virtex for transactions under 100 btc... nice.

Almost all of reddit is just memes and stupid image posts. Can we keep at a decent intellectual level?
