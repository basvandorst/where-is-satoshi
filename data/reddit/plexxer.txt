Once he deletes the account, it becomes permanent (aside from someone with control of the site modifying it).
I am not sure what happens to the post of the subreddit gets disabled for some reason. Do the direct links/shortlinks still work?

Could this also could potentially mean a huge risk for the blockchain, as trying to gain control over it (via a &gt;50% control) is now more lucrative?

I had never heard of this as well and had to Google it. It isn't used to impersonate you or to access your account. As far as I understand it, to get a free Google Voice number when you sign up, you have to supply a forwarding number. The scammers do this in order to get that free number that they will use for other purposes, and engage you in the manner of the OP as a pawn to authorize the forwarding number and then remove it from their new Google Voice account. At least that is how I understand the scam/Google Voice (I do not have a Google Voice account.)

This sounds like a good project for a web page. I wish I had more free time...

A calculator that can show projected ROI based on starting parameters (coin price, initial mining investment, difficulty, mining work rate) and selected growth rates (linear, exponential). 
There is more to it, but I will have to reply when I can get to a workstation (currently on a phone.)

ROI is hard to quantify as well because the R and I can be based on separate currencies with an unpredictable and volatile relationship.
