He is a mouth piece for the establishment we're trying to slow down the migration to cryptocurrencies. the infrastructure isn't quite ready yet.  so Bill Gates Warren Buffett and others were chosen to slow it down for the good of entire cryptocurrency structure. That is why it doesn't make sense to you guys. Your not thinking that you have been lied to ever since you entered the world. You got to realize you have been

@_date: 2018-06-22 21:58:20
Haha what does anyone have against that guy. A lovable guy with a desire to make Litecoin useful to the masses. A guy who is trying to break a monopoly of the bitcoin miners

The charts shown the end of a long wedge pattern. However it has become OBE with the market decline. I was hopeful litcoin will moon when bitcoin runs.

That is a great way to Take on risks. You made your decision and if you let it all go you know you are on the right track.  Hold on loose
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:30:01

Pay policy can insure the cripto why doesn't anyone see this it's PAL.  Why can't the exchanges buy the insurance they are making billions.  Protect us when we use your service

Have you ever wondered why that thing has to be so  big. I I can fit 4 Time as meny coins in my Trezor and I can fit that on my key chain.. So what do they have in there.  extra wires ? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:29:28
I like that you're honest 
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:07:55
That makes sense.  for when you punch in your password and such. Thoughtfully designed.
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:01:02
People on exchanges buy and sell based on TA even the nubes are using it. So you can't say TA is irrelevant. Nice try though. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:43:03
I was able to call the low of bitcoin and if this wave is epic meaning large I would have called it last year .
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:34:54
Just think of all that media could be paid for on demand and instantly with a Tron Token. Haters are going to hate but it's the truth.  Guys TRON is no joke  it has to be Marketed 24/7 because it's has to reach the masses. Unlike Etherium or Icon That only need to reach B2B. TRON is a big.  It's run by the foundation that is well connected. That timesquare advertising stunt was to show that they have the reach and influence.  That particular add spot has a year long waiting list. To get to cut in line shows they have influence. You guys don't Know that because your a bunch of Investors who don't think. So pull your head out of the crowd think and open your eyes. Or guys like me will end up eating your lunch.

Yes is all psychological that these patterns happen because that is how we monkeys think. We think the bannanas will  run out at 10 for some reason on bitcoin because  subconsciously we have seen it before so we get spooked again. Good work on finding the pattern. You got your head in the game and thank you for sharing this.
