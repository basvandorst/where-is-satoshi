You are right. I would add that those being vocally loud and abrasive over the issue likely have the most to lose, be that control over discussion media or the 'power' over developing the main client.
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:22:40
Unfortunately whilst in general terms you are correct, you are not completely right.
In new bitcoin with an artificial fee market and where transaction demand is now abutting the maximum blocksize simply submitting a transaction with a non-zero fee may not be sufficient to ensure confirmation.
If transaction volumes continue to rise then gradually the failure of transactions to be confirmed with ejection from the mempool will become more and more commonplace (for the first time since 2009!). 
The thought process of those who set the Core roadmap seems to be that if you really want to use the bitcoin network then you should be 'willing to pay for it'. Quite how that works for everyone when everyone is willing to pay for it but there isn't room doesn't seem to have been through through as the natural consequence is a bidding war for transactions which rapidly makes bitcoin artificially and unnecessarily expensive compared to other payment media - not to mention unreliable as a payment tool.
The next argument put forward is that most transactions are spam and don't matter so relax we have ages to sort this out. But that is absolutely wrong in my opinion. No fee paying transaction can be categorised as spam in bitcoin without breaking a base feature of bitcoin - that it is open and trustless. When developers start deciding who can and cannot transact over the network it is the beginning of the end for the experiment.

Like any functioning market. 
The attack dogs arguing with you on here know they hold a minority view.
We have truth and majority opinion on our side so let's censor and ban those who disagree with us aggressively - said no one ever..

Given it is a minor fork of Core 0.11 to simply increase the maximum blocksize from 1mb to 2mb I suggest you tone down your rhetoric..
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:37:50
Core has had over a year knowing this was coming..
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:43:19
Excellent post. 
1) 0 fee transactions are no longer relevant. 
2) how can a fee market develop which supports mining if the userbase stops growing? After all there is only so much room in each block..And please don't parrot lightning network as some kind of saviour for this.

Why are you obsessing about developers from a single bitcoin reference client quitting? There are plenty of other functional implementations and only yesterday this entire subreddit was filled with bile filled posts denigrating Hearn for rage quitting..
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:27:31
You are just scaremongering. Of course if we have a fork then the users will want 42 million coins! Nonsense. 
The facts are that the 1mb limit was a temporary spam measure which is now being used to change network/economic behaviour of the system by those who develop the reference client. 
I care about decentralisation but it is a balance between continued growth of the network and maintaining acceptable levels of decentralisation. As I said most reasonable people would agree that a 2mb blocksize limit is very much acceptable if it allows 2 more years of network growth.
Ultimately the market will decide - and that is the reason this reddit is creeping with downvoted sock puppets on every single thread related to these topics - those controlling the reference client are truly worried that they are about to lose their exalted position. There would be no reason for censorship otherwise.
The beauty of this argument is that both of us obviously care deeply about bitcoin and only one will be proven right. i favour the users and market based solutions. You favour extreme decentralisation and artificial centrally planned economics. Lets see!

@_date: 2016-01-21 20:54:46
Why brand anything? So people can see a choice and make a selection. 
This juncture is a political decision for the community.
Either bitcoin chooses to scale on chain to gain global adoption but at the cost of some decentralisation of nodes. Or bitcoin remains decentralised but becomes more expensive, less useful as a payment layer and reaches a hard transactions cap. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:52:28
Being contrarian is not a reliable strategy.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:36:45


Er no. 
If the market wants more bitcoin network capacity then the market will get it. There is overwhelming support to increase the blocksize and support more users whilst keeping transactions cheap. No reasonable person is suggesting that raising the blocksize to 2mb will sacrifice decentralisation in any meaningful way whatsoever.
Either Core provides that solution or a fork will do so. You cannot stop the market and your attempts to price out the common user from bitcoin will fail badly.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:01:48
Yes I think raising the blocksize 20x represents scaling. 
It allows 20x as many users to transact with bitcoin now and if bitcoin has reached that many people then it is a success. 
Crippling bitcoin into a settlement layer system whilst additional payment layers have not even been tested is just stupid.
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:38:33
So any of this decentralised group can merge changes they want to the codebase.. or not?
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:36:34
Consensus is a fluid construct. I don't speak for either side but the extreme polarisation forced on this subreddit is unhealthy to debate. 
If a potential hard fork occurs it will be between two versions of Core which are almost identical apart from some minor maximum blocksize code. Vitally important differences based upon the future of the network philosophically, but essentially identical implementations in every other regard. This narrow difference between the two camps should be kept in mind.
@_date: 2016-01-23 12:03:12
Literally every other reply to this thread (apart from OP) miss the point. I wonder why? Oh yeah it's the Core fanclub brigading every new thread which dares question the status quo..again.

If you are calling people you disagree with 'idiot' then you have already lost the  argument.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:54:57
How many nodes run the latest version of Core? How many will run the more contentious 0.12?

2) multi-sig and distribute. 
3) bip38 and distribute..
4) steganography

@_date: 2016-01-23 21:10:44
I think you are missing the point. You or I do not get to say what 'transactions of very little economic significance' are. People are free to use the network to move a penny or a million dollars worth of bitcoin as long as they pay a transaction fee. 
If the network were unable technically to process any more transactions then we should be having this debate and pushing transactions off chain. But we are nowhere near that point yet!
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:24:25
We don't need to raise it 20x today. Just 2x.
This is the same flawed argument as makes below this that VISA has x transactions right now. Who cares how many transactions VISA has? 
Bitcoin simply needs to have enough capacity to keep the network growing and right now and for the next few years that is easily achievable on chain. 
Will some nodes decide not to run bitcoin as the traffic requirements rise? Possibly. Will lots more nodes be run by businesses and other affiliated users as bitcoin becomes more widespread? Possibly.

Yet another thread saying the same thing..at least space them out through the day a bit more..
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:29:24
You like to have it both ways don't you.
So we should trust Core to implement a scaling solution but now suddenly there aren't enough 'dev volunteers' for something as trivial as deciding a transaction fee?
The cold reality is that if we didn't have a totally unnecessary artificial fee market and insufficient blockspace because the maximum blocksize is set too low then no transactions would be delayed and a simple flat transaction fee could be used by everyone.
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:43:59

@_date: 2016-01-21 20:45:51
Why should fees scale with demand? That wasn't the case previously, nor is it the case in most of the world. It is ridiculous to implement such an artificial system, especially in the context of fixed blockspace and growing transaction volumes.
Bitcoin might as well roll over and pass on the baton to the next cryptocurrency to take it's throne..

Advocating a single monolithic reference client which can arbitrarily set the rules of the network is central planning.
When the economic majority agrees with the developers controlling that client then everything is fine. Until they start to make changes which the majority may find detrimental to network utility or to the value structure of the network. 
I want bitcoin to scale. I think additional payment layers will be the standard way people use or interact with bitcoin in the future. But right now instituting changes which limits network/user growth will stifle bitcoin before it even needs such payment layers.
No one wants a hostile fork. Those supporting such direct action can see how potentially catastrophic failing to act right now could be to global bitcoin adoption. Failing to act now also alters the basic economics of the network to an unknown scenario which is untested and could kill bitcoin off in favour of other solutions.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:01:08
That is a matter of opinion. 
Do not forget that the block reward renders such discussions in 2016 largely irrelevant until at least 2020. 
Bitcoin was designed with an exponentially falling block reward for a reason. This part of the curve is where the network should be concentrating upon growth, growth and more growth such that a critical mass of transactions and fees can offset the falling block reward in the coming years.
Choosing high fees and limiting on chain transactions now is suicide to bitcoin and virtually guarantees another usurper chain will eventually take its first mover advantage.
edit: Oh and fees are not an anti-spam mechanism. There is no such thing as spam, simply transactions which pay fees and those which do not. If you pay the fee then you are free to use the network.
