That's like saying when someone lands on my hotel on Park Place in Monopoly it means nothing, hell no, it's fun!
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:06:04
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:09:31
You sound like my asshole older brother, give this guy a break, there is nothing wrong with letting other people know when some crazy shit goes down.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:08:00


I'm down for Ganymede, lets at least set up a visitors center there and maybe we can start selling plots.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:17:22
Im talking about the guy saying that Op is whining what are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:18:20
God No! once I buy my precious coin its mine forever! I will never sell!!!!

Thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:05:57
How do you know the core is dead? and if so is that a big deal?
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:12:37
I have learned to chill out when things get rough, i.e., dips, FUD, and what not. I have invested a little bit of money in Bitcoin and I am legitimately  excited about crypto's especially Bitcoin. I have even started a blog, please don't go there it sucks but it's fun when I get a chance to mess with it. Just kidding go there right now or you will hurt my feelings. Http://iquestinfo.com

I asked my wife and she knows everything and she said $3500. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:19:38
I just created this bad boy 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:28:12
how you know?
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:43:02
I think Coinbase is like Paypal, you use it for stuff, pays some fees for the service, but you don't store your wealth there. I think its common since right? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:27:42
yeah but the moon.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:40:20
Send me 1 bitcoin @  and we can talk.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:31:40
Sorry , im too lazy to look it up myself, what's with the chicken references on the litecoin subreddit? 
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:41:22
Now if mainstream media would just pick this up it's the kind of story that could give Bitcoin some good press.
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:01:24
I have ordered from here with good results, same stuff you get from India but takes only days vs weeks.
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:17:38
Ill check these out thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:55:47
So in essence I will have some sort of new free altcoin called BCC sounds like a good thing to me.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:39:15
I agree, I see a time in the future when you pay your mortgage, etc. with Bitcoin that's why I'm hodling like all the other OG's here.
@_date: 2017-07-14 09:45:34
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:12:22
Great cause, these guys come back from seeing allot of bad shit but usually have to deal with it without any support. Way too many of these men and women end up committing suicide. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:29:46
No insult taken but whenever someone uses the word whining its generally derogatory. I agree that this guy was giving good advice but I feel it was in a shitty way. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:30:51
So If I have a paper wallet with like $50 worth of bitcoin on it does that mean I will also have $50 worth of BCC as well after the split?
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:03:27
For someone sitting at home with a bank account or a credit card, how do they buy Bitcoin? You need someone like Coinbase to make it easy to buy Bitcoin. Just like you need Paypal to be able to buy your crap on eBay.

For some reason it seems to be the next best place for humans to re-locate after the earth. The fact that water is there makes it a possibility for habitation. I think this song sums it up:  (not really I just think its a cool song) remember I'm high right now.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:38:46
Its been a while so its time.
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:39:13
If I knew the answer to that I would be rich.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:52:04
You are a very nice person. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:44:14
Hellz Ya!
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:40:45
Best damn post I've read here in a long time!
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:34:41
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:41:43
I think people are starting to see that this thing is real and has potential.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:36:38
Rich and fit, that would be amazing.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:44:12
Also, we could get overtaken by aliens and then what? Aliens don't give a shit about Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:30:50
yeah... I'm doing them anyway but I was really hoping for $3000 today :-(
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:39:01
Oh God not this again, someone PM me when we get to $3000! I don't have enough money laying around to keep buying the dips.
