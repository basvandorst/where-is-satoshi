The article literally says “It means that investors will be able to buy and sell "future" contracts in Bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price.” 
How confusing is that?

Should really be part of the “discouraged topics here or anywhere on the sub.”
But yeah! Bragging about your .0076BTC is a thing.

A really “scientific”1 (look he has charts) analysis says that we will see a correction in price soon. 
Do you think the way old media is covering bitcoin will come to pass in a month or two or it’s here to stay? 
1.

Right answer is what is the amount you won’t miss and can recover from. 
throwaway account for privacy. I too have 600k in my bank account and the maximum risk I am willing to take is 5% or 30k. So far I have invested less than  18k in bitcoin, although through sheer luck my initial investment has become 60k but, it could quite easily be 3k tomorrow morning. 
I am considering selling some and reducing my exposure.
Don’t let the $$ signs blind you. Don’t let the memes and craziness of this subs echo chamber make you take foolish decisions you will regret. 
Bitcoin is extremely speculative and there can easily be a 80-90% correction. Don’t put more than you can afford to lose.
