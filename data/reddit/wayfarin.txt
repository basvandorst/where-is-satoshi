Terrible idea. Tie bitcoin to the sort of "5 dollar iPad!" scammy/spammy/pop-up image these sites have when we are trying to mainstream the currency.

I'm a pretty staunch conservative and I think I would vote for him over a big government republican any day. This is particularly brave, considering the democratic donner base: 
"Allowing more funding and expanding charter schools and compensating teachers in part based on their students’ performance."

Never has a currency or equity failed after a whopping 7 years. NEVER

There is absolutely nothing wrong with trade imbalances.

I've heard this a lot. What context can any of this be considered ok? Unless he made edits like "I want to illegally bus people around *snip* said my really corrupt friend who totally isn't me."
Seems like releasing full unedited versions of things is a standard usually applied to the right. I definitely don't remember a 60 hour version of bowling for columbine.

The store my wife and i run definitely would, but while shopify and bitpay work easily together, there isn't a very easy way to discount bitcoin payments specifically. We could have a discount code and advertise it to the community, but anyone could use it at checkout even if they're paying with visa. I would love to pass the savings on. The 1% bitpay transaction fee is way better than what we dish to PayPal on a yearly basis.
If someone has advise on this for small merchants, or shopify stores, let me know.

Gotta love people who use Mexicans and illegal immigrants interchangeably. Never gets old.

Is the site not live yet? My wife's store is participating and I can't find the vendor list anywhere. Shouldn't it have been posted at midnight?
Also, are bitcoinblackfriday.com and .info run by the same people?
Edit: we signed up for the .com list. Just got an email reminder that "bitcoin black Friday is the 28th!" Must be the form email from last year and they forgot to change the date. Not a great sign.

American citizens literally collect your trash from your streets for a great wage, and you don't think they would do it in a comfortable indoor setting? Boy oh boy.

Damn. We signed up for the .com list. No idea who gets more traffic.
Bright side: Ashton Kutcher tweeted the .com link. Must be legit. /s

Sweet! Thanks. I'll check in tomorrow morning.
