What confuses me sometimes is that if people really think Bitcoin is going to the moon, why would you want to buy a cup of coffee with it.

Does it though? Considering every transfer of bitcoin is a taxable event and the transaction fees involved (present day)?
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:08:36
That is not true. Taxable gain is taxable gain no matter how big or small. If small, it may not be reported so you may easy evade taxes, but technically it is still taxable event. Furthermore, if held less than a year it would be taxed at ordinary income rates.

Well presumably the theory is that it would stabilize at some point, but that question is the main hurdle to adoption as a currency
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:09:33
Yeah one would think

I have no doubt that is true for those sitting on millions in BTC, but the exception doesn’t make the rule.

Why wouldn’t you just buy the coffee with fiat, a currency being devalued, rather than with something that could potentially be worth 100x in two years.  Going to look back and wonder why you paid $500 for that cup of coffee.

Okay? The research was done by a crypto asset management firm.

Not to mention if you sent that amount of bitcoin yesterday it would be worth $67.69 today BEFORE fees

Don’t seem to have that problem with my bank 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:29:09
Correct.

You forgot “to have no recourse when someone hacks into the exchange and steals half a billion of our money” 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:51:22
You do realize the bandwagoners were what drove the price up to begin with.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:42:51
Is it though? It’s only unusual if you make the assumption that crypto acts as a safe haven, which is a theory that has rarely been tested

If they can’t comprehend this they shouldn’t be investing their own money.
