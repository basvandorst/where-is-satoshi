Let's play a funny game: how you would mix such portfolio for a gift?

Doesn't make sense to compare trezor with cash/credit card.
Trezor is like your bank account, you keep most of your money there, feel secure about it.
If you want a simple cash wallet that's easy to use, just install an android wallet into your phone and move a small portion of money from your thezor there. And go to the pub with that.
Or do you keep all your money in your cash wallet too?

Wow. This will make a great collective item in few decades :)

I'm using it probably once peer weekly, mostly to load my android wallet and trade on bitstamp and never had a single issue so far.

People need to loose bcoins in order to finally invest in a decent hardware wallet :(
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:53:27
People, please use hardware wallets such as trezor.

Bitcoin is not perfect...

Well, I think you guys don't understand about what the problem "seems" to be. Yes, back-door in firmware is possible, but we have the community for that. Yes, few coins can be lost until the community identifies the backdoor, but you keep your release hygiene well, you're the the first to jump and get the new firmware but wait a little until it is tested a little, right?

You're right, better keep all my bitcoins in ze cloudz!

I think it will take a lot of time until I start trusting my smart phone with my money.

probably a better idea is to support and push for devices like [bitcoin trezor]( these are much more secure
@_date: 2013-05-10 17:33:31
Buy the bitcoin trezor, you can have your bitcoins with you and most importantly secure.

The crowd souring network failed before, just because the wireless requires too much energy. Plus their video is totally vaporware.
