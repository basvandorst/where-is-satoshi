Outputs per day is a better indicator of overall economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain than transactions per day. Since one transaction can include multiple outputs, the number of total outputs is more important than the number of transactions themselves.

Dear Mr. Maxwell, thanks for this opportunity to get some insights into your intensions about the future development of the Bitcoin architecture. I was acting in the 1990s in the chip design &amp; verification industry (Matra-MHS, Quickturn &amp; Mentor Graphics) and verification engineers were fighting with challenges like "Who tests the test" and how to manage design complexity. In fact the cost pressure for any so called 'tape-out' was huge and in the order of several millions $US per redesign, requiring additional tape-outs. In more &amp; more ASIC projects each successful ASIC required more &amp; more several of such tape-outs. The outcome of this cost-pressure dilemma was the innovative path of then upcoming 'Free-Programmable-Gate-Array's ... so called FPGAs. I'm a layman concerning Bitcoin, but this innovative path of 'Sidechain's reminds me back to my time in the 1990s fighting complexity of chip-design ... Cutting a long story short ... you might find in research papers of that time (1985 .. 1995, years BEFORE the then upcoming FPGAs) ideas, concepts &amp; strategies for avoidance of design failures of very complex designs ... in order to tackle the huge cost pressure of additional tape-outs ...﻿
