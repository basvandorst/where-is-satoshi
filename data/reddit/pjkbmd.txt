That would be great. I have a 27sat/byte transaction waiting for about a week.

Any idea what the bandwidth demand is in general? If I have the standard low tier internet package from Comcast will I run into issues?

I'd like to be able to go one full day in 2016 using bitcoin as my only payment.

That reddit post was a great read.
For those that are unfamiliar with Magic: The Gathering, it is a well established collectible card game. The guy offering up the money has spent a decent amount of time buying up the supply of a specific card. He even went as far as to pay people to burn copies of the card and videotape it for proof. Now he is trying to enact his master plan. He wants a professional player to do well on the ProTour, an invitation only professional tournament, while using a deck that heavily features the specific card he has been hoarding. This will hopefully spike demand for that card and he will profit. The card price was around $0.15 when he was buying them. If the deck became popular a card of this rarity could be worth a decent amount, say $20. Seems insane. If you think bitcoin is volatile, look at trading card economy. 
tldr: guy is trying to artificially influence the economy of a trading card game.

If the tether market did collapse would it effect bitcoin more than other cryptocurrencies?

Feature, not a bug.

If this dude has such a grand scheme for a better digital currency why isn't he working on making it? Isn't that was academics like him are supposed to do?
Instead he just bashes bitcoin with the same lame arguments that have been made over and over. More of the same...
