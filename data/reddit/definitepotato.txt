I tried this app, doesn’t give me any option to send the sats to a personal wallet, I only have the option to “spend” sats I’ve earned on discounts within the Fold app. Sounds shady to me. Are people actually earning bitcoin or is this just another point system?

Fair enough, thanks for the info. I’ll have to listen to that podcast. I didn’t know they offered a prepaid credit card, that’s interesting.

It's not a Bitcoin research thing.  Highs are always unknown because the potential number is infinite.  The low is always known, it's 0, that's the bottom.  To see each year that Bitcoin is establishing a new bottom that's nearly double from the last year, it shows that Bitcoin traders are less willing to part with their Bitcoin, it means confidence is strengthening.  What this also means is that when a new bottom/low is established, in general, the currency/asset should only do one of two things, move sideways and stay stagnant or go up and establish new highs.

I recommend  and  and  as a starting point.  Impulse, desperation and faith are not good markers or metrics to decide where to put your money.  Educate yourself and ask questions constantly, seek answers and make decisions based on fact.

The internet is a weird place, don't be afraid of asking questions, otherwise you'll never get answers.  Ignore the trolls.

I booted a clean tails and tested your theory, it appears you are correct.  I upgraded trezor library and still had an issue, though not a clear error as to why.  I then installed the trezor bridge and bingo, device appears. Running Electrum in a terminal shows a WebUSB error failing to connect to the device.  Now I want to go back and test without upgrading trezor library.

The trezor library available in the official tails repo is version 0.9.0, the latest as of this comment is 0.11.5.  Electrum as of version 3.3.x will complain about the old 0.9.0 library being used and ask for a more recent version, at least 0.11.0.  You'll have to manually install trezor 0.11.x using pip3 to get it to work until the official repo upgrades.
Edit: Correction, this once worked for me just a few days ago, but now fails without first installing the trezor bridge.

That's odd.  It works for me after I install the updated trezor library.  You're using Tails 4.1?
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:22:23
I did.  In order to install those packages you’ll need an internet connection. Why you can’t connect is a different issue you may want to ask in the Tails subreddit.

Okay I booted a clean Tails 4.1.1 and did the following to successfully connect the trezor:
* Install Trezor Bridge: dpkg -i trezor-bridge_2.0.27_amd64.deb
* Install Python3 Dependencies: sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
* Upgrade Trezor Python Libraries: torsocks pip3 install setuptools trezor==0.11.5
Edit: Download trezor bridge from 
Edit2: If you get an error about a missing "safe_t" library you'll have to add a few more things:
* Install GCC: sudo apt install gcc
* Install Additional Python3 Dependency: torsocks pip3 install safet
