Yaas! The most important lesson of them all!
In the late 90's, my rule after rendering my Linux box unbootable, was, 'You shall never compile your Linux kernel late at night when tired".
Now, it's, "Don't fuck with your bitcoin while tired or drunk".

Yes! Justin's personal story is one of sacrifice, and he has accomplished amazing things and helped the "forgotten" people of the Congo.

Well. How did your plan go? Well, I hope :)

Not sure but I know it takes a lot of disk space

My bad! You’re rad!

That’s awesome man. Can’t wait to see it!

I️t took them 2weeks to get back to me on a support ticket. But otherwise, I’ve used them for probably 10 transactions and everything has been perfect. My support ticket was due to my mistake.

But Yas Marina Blue is so damn pretty. I have the M3 in it :)

Buried my stickers in the bottom of my garbage right away.

Please be careful when donating to charities that are too small to be rated by Charity Navigator, Charity Watch or the other charity review organizations. There are a shitload of bad charities that fly under the radar due to their size. 
I will volunteer to evaluate charities using the same methodology as Charity Navigator before you give, as I have experience doing this with my local charities.

Coinbase rocks. They say 2-4 days but it shows as "pending" the next day. I'm impressed

It's the opposite with me. My employees mocked me when I was buying BTC back in 2015. They finally got in the game in 2017. lol.

Congratulations for meeting your goals! I would always keep your goals in mind when thinking of reinvesting. If there is spare money to reinvest, then do it.

That's really cool. I didn't know about silver's rise and fall.

Feels pretty cheap right now, to be honest. Although I have bought much, much cheaper in the past.

Transferred BCH from Coinbase to GDAX to binance. Sold for BTC :)
