Fees have skyrocketed and so have settling times 
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:26:00
That’s incredibly dumb though, maybe the amount they were worth back then
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:44:27
Why assume It’s money we can’t afford to lose ? 0% credit cards are a great example
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:39:17
Neither is a tech support agent.... 
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:23:10
Very 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:47:06
Why wouldn’t they? I buy a game and send crypto by the time it settles I might need a bit note since the price fell, so now i need to send just a bit more but at a huge fee and I must wait for it to settle. Cycle continues 
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:34:54
I meant if you bought 100k of them, give him a 100k now instead of the coins 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:19:32
I mean you can’t spell should I not take you serious ? High time someone ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:08:07
Sounds like jealousy but nothing morbid. Continue on with the salt 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:39:27
How's paying fees on everything frugal ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:45:57
He's a good host, his job is to ask the questions the average user is thinking or needs to know. Great ending !
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:31:03
Oh I meant your comment about waiting to see people lose money, that's not a normal statement. I don't believe in certain stocks like Tesla but I don't wish to see people lose their money.
I wish the best for people even if they disagree with me ha
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:57:18
True he should have just read this fanatic subreddit ;) super unbiased.
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:54:07
I mean it has to sell just throw crypto in there :) 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:29:21
i dnno,i feel as if the majority of people that used this were bigger idiots eh?
The amount of inconpetence shown is amazing, yet people put thousands in there....
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:48:20

@_date: 2017-08-01 15:41:29
If your taking advice on Reddit .... 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:41:36
It's called support levels, I like how your actually making fun of it haha 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:42:41
You can still profit on things you don't support, look at most people's stock investments lol
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:35:18
 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:46:17
That's not really remotely close to what I was saying. You can fire such person then when they open a company you can invest on it .
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:49:40
Two years ago it was 1500
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:19:55
If you owned a Bitcoin before the last fork, and you had it on a cold storage wallet or one of the exchanges that supported the split then you could now turn any Bitcoin into both Bitcoin and BitcoinCash.
If you bought a Bitcoin after the fork, then you only bought a Bitcoin and the BitcoinCash it came from it was already split from it.
With this new fork, whenever it happens you will get the exact amount of Bitcoin you have in this new BitcoinSilver. If you own .5 Bitcoins, you will be able to get .5 BitcoinSilvers.
Double value? maybe but doubtful, the new coin will have its own price, so its not going to be worth the same as a Bitcoin, it could be more or less. the last split, BitcoinCash is now worth roughly $600 while Bitcoin sits at $7k, so people did not double their money, but they got some 'free money'.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:05:52
no worries! super common, either way this $ could be benefiting us :(
And still a big BULL on BTC :D
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:39:43
well thats the great thing and value prop for BTC, it has limited supply. Unlike other tokens/coins which keep pumping out supplies, BTC is finite.
You might have heard of the 21 club, owning 21 BTC would give you a 1/1miilionth piece of Bitcoin, in practice only 1 million people can own 21 bitcoins.
I think we all think there will be no more to mine and coin will be used for its value, we will see transactions at the .000001BTC level. People will keep losing keys and the overall supply will go down :) Each BTC will hit $100k and we will all be happy campers.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:11:56
not a problem! were all BTC fans here and this stuff can be intimidating at first! happy tradings
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:11:02
But that's what your doing with this post..... lol why did we not call btc gold an attack? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:08:17
But at an all time high !?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:54:47
its not sarcasm, but its my understand (and correct me if i'm wrong) that they are avoiding taxes, not evading.
You and i avoid taxes, i sure do. Last year i had a ton of tax credits and rebates that allowed me to avoid a ton of taxation. Do these papers show that apple *evaded* taxes?
Avoid and Evade are different things btw
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:16:46
apologies, i did say bitcoin gold! :( i meant bitcoin cash though
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:12:28
Either way crazy lol.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:03:41
so you will need to google that, im not sure what Ledger is doing but Coinbase and Trezor for example are supporting the fork, although it sounds like its going to be harder to split it (not automatically).
unfortunately im not sure what Ledger's stance is, what is CB? sorry!
Cold storage is likely best if your uncertain, then wait for people to figure out how to split and do so then.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:39:36
So we cried last time and we cry now... what can they do 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:31:51
You mean make a $5 profit ?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:01:01
Lets use actual tax definitions? and we can see your title is misleading.
Tax avoidance is the legitimate minimizing of taxes, using methods approved by the IRS. Businesses avoid taxes by taking all legitimate deductions and by sheltering income from taxes by setting up employee retirement plans and other means, all legal and under the Internal Revenue Code or state tax codes.
Tax evasion, on the other hand, is the illegal practice of not paying taxes, by not reporting income, reporting expenses not legally allowed, or by not paying taxes owed.
It does not seem like you really understand the difference one and the other which is super common.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:07:56
Google bro.
Coinmarketcap is good for prices, bitcoin gold was the last split and it's around $500 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:04:19
Where did you look? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:08:52
Yep! and yes Coinbase said they would support i believe. This is why you want to own your keys for the most part, the keys will allow you to 'cash' this new coin.
If you own one bitcoin with code (1234), then after the fork you can do something like:
* Send from Wallat A to Wallet B - 1 Bitcoin with code (1234)
* Send from Wallet A to Wallet B - 1 Bitcoinsilver with code (1234)
And thats the basics of it obviously there are a lot of technical parts to it.
And yes about cold storage, but do read notes to make sure the companies will support the split, its 90%+ likely they will.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:06:39
We all believe this monster will hit 15k or more but with split coming expect some pullbacks but don't panic! 
Cheers 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:51:34
currently sitting at $609.94	
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:16:00
I believe coinbase stated you would get your coins around January if you had them pre fork! So fear not! 
As far as selling? Well people think that the price went up only because of the fork and expect it to drop. They wanted to ride it up and sell before the split where it can tank back down.
It's a gamble but could pay off, sell at 7500 and rebuy at 5000? Then missing out on a free coin isn't so bad.
Also people think alt coins lost value because people sold them to buy bitcoin. So another strategy is to sell bitcoin high and rebuy alt coins. People will sell bitcoin and rebuy alts bringing their price back up .
If you get it right all of these can make you money, if I knew myself I'd be rich haha
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:41:04
It just says they are monitoring, what if suddenly miners are still interested, we would crucify Coinbase for not monitoring the community to follow general interest.
Everyone here thinks we speak for all users 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:57:33
Wait!!?? They evade taxes ??? That's news to me. Seriously 
Let's stop spreading misinformation to legitimize bitcoin makes us look bad.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:37:34
That's irrelevant to this conversation though 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:49:11
How profitable are they 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:26:24
not really, the definition of relevant:
closely connected or appropriate to what is being done or considered.
which you seem to not grasp
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:54:26
About to purchase some BTC personally, enjoy the dive!!
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:44:10
you are buying at the highest, so while we all think this will moon be ready to see some pullbacks
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:30:25
But you didn't buy it all at its low? So how can all of it have 10x? You would have bought many coins at its highs 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:27:08
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:53:28
not really relevant, i just mean why compare yourself to something completely different.
All im asking
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:57:50
im asking to understand if thats how it works, im not confident enough to know if thats how it works. 
If its my intitial investment i wasnt sure if it would be considered a profit or just taking back my investment.
then down the line when i took out the rest, those would all be counted as profits and taxed
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:54:13
Alright so this thread was me explaining that using dollar cost average means you wouldn't get the max upswing.
So how is your comment relevant ?
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:51:12
Just like Coinbase it's convenience, Coinbase is probably not the best place to purchase but it's simple so people eat the fees. If you have cash and you want a bitcoin these atms seems quick and easy 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:45:11
I know what it is and how it works, but due to it you wouldn't enjoy the 10x we've seen from low to high. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:40:03
Okay but apple has revenue how does btc generate revenue ? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:13:39
Yes but it’s taken I guarantee 
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:44:28
Eh a bunch of people have alerts to sell at certain points. Sure you would pump but also a good amount would be dumped, it’ll come down to which wins 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:21:21
" it was created to make some things less corrupt and more easier." uh.....
not sure if serious
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:58:32
1btc = 1btc is very false, 1btc = what it can buy you, in any currency/good. Whether its $250 or .1g of gold. Value deals with the ability to purchase and trade for goods.
So when people dont think 1btc is worth jack, even if 1btc = 1btc. Garbage will be garbage.
Everyone buying this is doing it as an investment, stop this non-sense of decentralizing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:19:50
yee! my 1st tag
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:56:03
decentralizing currency is far from reducing corruption though. It is a bit of the opposite, but i can see the argument for it
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:45:13
i am not disagreeing that the current system is corrupt. But decentralizing information takes away soooo much transparency and liability away.
In case of a major attack that would threaten the system, who would fall responsible?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:54:36
:/ its a harsh world, and i hate seeing bad advice too. I worked in Bankruptcies... so i saw hundreds of people lose everything due to shitty advice... and not just on stocks.... but buying homes/cars and living beyond their means.
:( its a sad fucking world :( now im sadder lol
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:14:11
neither do you, none of you do!!! stop acting like you undestand exchange processes, the fact of the matter is that this "decentralized" currency does not have to follow any rules.
That is your whole point of bitcoin, to not be centralized and thus have little to no oversight. So yes, traditional rules would limit people getting ripped off, but Bitcoin isnt regulated!!! why is it so hard to get?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:47:52
Honestly, you cant ask people to filter their opinions. If you are making a life changing decision based on reddit, then you have no one to blame.
I could care less if 90% of reddit said i should invest in Bitcoin, at the end of the day its my own choice. Yes, we provide quite a bit of stupid BS, but a fool will soon be parted from his money, no matter what.
Do not DO what others tell you, be an educated person, learn why they are doing what their doing, and you will either agree or disagree with their logic.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:12:36
see, this is the issue i have with most Bitcoin Investers. they make their own rules.
If i had made a call on a stock at $1300 and it dropped down to $500 range, i would admitt i was wrong. And figure out a new strategy.
Most BitCoin people seem to be too prideful to admitt they had no clue what they were doing. And simply continue to digg themselves deeper.
Best of luck tho!

having worked in Bankruptcy, its almost as good as being 100% dischargeable. The type of disability you need would be... well enough to render you useless to work and do day-to-day activities

it appeared on my front page, is it solvent? i found it intersting and replied
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:57:06
i go into investing with a target in mind. I know why the commodity is undervalued, and how much return i can get on it. I go in knowing that im looking for that 30-50% and i am out.
If i get it in one day? I will sell, and look for the next underperforming comoddity. I often do buy intending to hold for a year, knowing it can take that long. But getting this type of returns and not cashing out some is a bit of a mistake.
But then again, most Bitcoin investers are really just gambling, they just bought and didnt know when to sell, they kinda had no idea how to time the market or capitalize on gains.
Gambling does not equate to tradiing
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:28:33
the fact you have so many positive comments show the type of investors here. Everyone is okay knowing their money is gone lol
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:19:05
If you go into BK and you have had any type of holdings like Bitcoins, the creditors will nom nom those.
Also applying for BK and having active investments in the last 6 months while you already have debt... might not be the best idea
