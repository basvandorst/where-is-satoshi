Correct, but there's no standard implementation. That means that in X years I could have a bunch of shares and no way to combine them
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:05:22
Dude, it's a theoretical discussion on security measures.
Ideally the draft Shamir39 or SLIP-0039 standards would be adopted and we wouldn't need to have this conversation. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:16:29
That's exactly what I want, but there's no standardized version, which means I'd need to save the source code as well, which starts getting dodgy.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:39:27
but you also have to account for order of words, calculation and derivation time, checking if the addresses generated are populated (can't be sure the first bitcoin address you check will have a history- not every hardware wallet has stored BTC)...
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:34:16
The idea is redundancy - I'll need 2 out of 3 (any 2 out of 3) to restore the wallet, and I won't have a single point of failure.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:43:48
Sure, but 'spensive
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:09:33
I'm not clear on how you got to that conclusion... I don't see cracking time for number of words but rather for entropy
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:51:39
Wait, I'm not sure I understand... If the attacker knows words 1-8 and 17-24 AND knows which words s/he's missing, it is or is not brute forcible?
What kind of time/effort/computational power is necessary? Does the 24th word checksum assist the attacker? 
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:09:48
That's true of anything... 
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:00:16
Then you probably don't have one. You have to specially set it up. The PIN is specific to the device installation, so if you restore from seed because you forgot your PIN you're fine. The seed is the thing, and the password is part of the seed - a 25th word.
If you need to test if your seed is good you can either get a second ledger and restore to it OR use wipeable PC that is offline to run the following page:  and see if you get the same public addresses. Then completely wipe the PC. Chromebooks are good for this, because "powerwashing" a chromebook takes like 3 minutes and leaves you with a fresh install.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:40:17
There is, under settings, security, passphrase. Note that the passphrase creates a new wallet... it's like a 24th word in your mnemonic.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:11:44
The issue with that is that it needs to be recognized as important (so won't get destroyed) but useless without additional information.
What I'd really like is a secure way to split up the seed, like shamir's secret sharing scheme, but there's no standardized version that I can trust will still be around in say a decade
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:40:02
Yes yes, but that wasn't what I was asking.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:43:21
Cloud won't necessarily stay up, not to mention my inheritors won't necessarily know about it.

I just got a Coldti - you use a metal stamping kit to stamp your seed into titanium plates. That's my plan with this post.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:50:32
Here they barely exist at all and it's hundreds of dollars.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:51:01
You mean your 24 word seed? Do you have that?
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:06:06
So you recovered the wallet?

Maybe not worthless, but it's not up to my standards. Until something is enshrined by the community I won't assume it'll be workable in 20 years, and I won't assume there aren't vulnerabilities (though I doubt it) or bugs, or that the implementation won't change and old versions will disappear.
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:36:34
I'm honestly not knowledgeable enough to understand this
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:54:00
they're called ColdTi.  Good stuff, and cheap. Get 2 kits, one with the stamps and one without, and you have a spare plate for mistakes. If you make a simple one digit mistake, just stamp over it twice with a 1 in an X pattern.
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:34:47
Yes, I use that. Still, imagine your family finds your seeds and doesn't know what to do with them, then goes online and gets scammed into revealing it. Best to have the instructions ready to go with the seed.
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:51:56

This means there's a single point of failure, though. One share lost, all is lost.

I'm not familiar with any good solutions for multisig HD wallet seeds
@_date: 2018-06-05 00:17:13
I love shamir39! Unfortunately, there is no accepted standard implementation, which means I can't have any real confidence in family being able to find this or the other potential implementation (SLIP-0039) to assemble the seed. I really would love it if someone would complete a standard that could then be ratified, but no one seems to be paying any attention to it.
Although you are of course correct that the fewer words someone needs to solve for the weaker the security, 8 words is still quite a bit.
8^2048 is 3.375*10^1849... a BIG number (1850 digits!) Considering that it's relatively computationally expensive (relative to simple math calculations) to derive a seed from the mnemonic, and considering that each of the resultant seeds then needs to be compared to the blockchain to see if there's any crypto we can expect any non-govt attacker to take months to years of brute forcing before they find the correct seed.
This isn't meant to be perfect, but rather to help reduce the odds of theft while not increasing the odds of loss too much.
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:21:56
None of them would be interested right now, and they likely won't remember if they don't use this stuff regularly.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:50:03
Ah, but that's the beauty... Here two have to be lost for all to be lost. There's redundancy

Israel. Dunno... as far as I can tell from cursory internet searches they're basically extinct. There's a private company that charges around 1k usd per year, but it's not even in my city.
Honestly though, I don't think it's necessary. What I really want is a standard implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Ian Coleman was working on Shamir39, but he seems to have abandoned it. Satoshi Labs (creators of the Trezor) were working on SLIP-0039 but they seemed to have abandoned that, too. If it's not standardized, I can't assume it'll be available in 20 years. That's my minimum relevance threshold.

Multisig allows for 2 of 6 or 3 of 5 and so on? So not all keys are needed? Cool...
Would I be able to do this with a seed for a ledger nano s or whatever? So a single set of sigs could manage a whole portfolio?
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:56:10
Yeah, that low fee was set by an exchange. Don't know why they went so low and didn't give options to increase it. Still, got a good price (for the time) for the btc.

@_date: 2018-04-29 15:35:19
Thanks, I get it now
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:45:35
Sure, I get that. But maybe I don't fully understand the tech. The background is basically static, right? I get a bunch of identical static backgrounds and I print out my own card on transparent plastic (like for overhead projectors) and then place one on top of the other? Then what, I hide them all over?

Hey thanks again. You were spot on. The second one just confirmed 11.5 hours after tx. :)
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:39:06
Sure, but I want this to be a seed for multiple wallets. I want to do this with a portfolio (a la ledger nano s or trezor)
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:42:10
Yeah, this is another option. I'm just always concerned that part of it will be lost.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:38:02
Sure, I love coleman's implementation, but I can't trust that archive.org will still exist or that the USB's will work. I don't find that to be reliable enough.
BIP39 has been accepted as a standard, so I can rest assured that as long as blockchain is a thing BIP39 will exist. But Shamir39? It's been abandoned. I'm concerned about this stuff.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:28:09
Yeah, I get it now. Now all I need is a guide on this topic for the ledger nano S. In the settings I see passphrase and "temporary pin". If I add a passphrase does that create a new wallet? Will I be asked to give a new pin for the new wallet?
Thanks for the elucidation
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:01:08
I see - so I have a nice bip39 seed (24 word mnemonic). I engrave that and give it to family and put a modest amount of cash on there. I create a second seed which is the same 24 word mnemonic plus the passphrase which will generate a new seed and so be secure.
That's pretty great! The one disadvantage is that I'd be giving complete access to my family members immediately. I trust them, but I also value my privacy.
Still, this is better than anything else I've heard. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:44:34
Can you explain further? This sounds appropriate
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:02:54
From what I've read that's massively bruteforceable
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:43:03
Except that wouldn't allow for loss of some of the keys and also wouldn't allow for active management.
