Hi Matias, thanks for the info. Glad to see a recovery tool is being developed, the solution I ended up using can get *very* tedious depending on how many addresses have been generated in the shared wallet. I still think having an expire time is a great safety feature that doesn't overly complicate things as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2015-06-07 05:23:30
Coolest of beans, thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:12:50
I was put off by having to register an account for Coinkite and having to sideload APKs on my Android for Electrum, as far as multisig-capable wallets are concerned. I admit to overestimating Copay's software quality by not testing it using testcoins first. Sorry for upsetting you.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:53:10
Looks promising, thanks!

Nah I'm just stingy. It was taking a little long so I just broadcasted another one with a fee. All is good now :)
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:10:11


And if they did I can't afford it anyway. ;)
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:09:18
There we go, returned to sender:  (may disappear due to no fees but whatever)
The decryption page was handy, but what really saved my ass were those magical derivation paths, I'm curious to know where did they come from. You deserve a beer or something just for that. 1 beer An aside: I did not find any coins in the addresses from each xprv individually, which was expected since I only sent to a P2SH address. So it was a matter of finding the right combination of 3 pubkeys that resulted in the same address.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:29:34
I like this strategy, the trouble I'm having now is finding a suitable tool for extracting private keys from Copay backups (I didn't provide my own master keys for devices A and B), need to keep digging or start writing one myself. From there I guess I'll need to somehow reconstruct the same multisig address in a bitcoin-core wallet and spend it from there.

I see, TIL!

That was before the whole Mt. Gox fiasco, I won't be surprised if they decided to wait another year to test the waters again.

It's okay guys, they said they're working on solutions. [Stay tuned™](  
Seriously though, anyone knows of any Bitcoin forks implementing the 2-phase POW algorithms suggested when GHash last reached 50%? (e.g. [this]( or [this]( I'd like to follow some real progress.

Not even a real screenshot. My gameboy had more pixels than that.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:00:03
Yup, just do what CoinBase does and show the QR code next to it. Verify with phone.
I guess then the malware could replace the QR code as well, but having QR-generating code should give it a much larger profile for detection.
@_date: 2014-07-31 13:02:48
In your post, yes.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:33:23
Why would a non-SW miner leave out SW transactions? Don't all SW transactions still appear valid to non-SW nodes due to it being a soft-fork?
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:25:38
A system in which the rules never change to meet user demands is not what I would call "immutable"... "soon-to-be obsolete" is more appropriate.
HFs are indeed difficult, but that ensures only the best fork implementation survives based on mandatory voting by users and miners. If they decide that one of bitcoin's rules (e.g. max blocksize) is no longer important nor beneficial, so be it.
SWSF changes bitcoin's important rules anyway by circumventing the HF process. This is the basis of existing general (in addition to [technical]( advice against it.
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:09:05
I agree, particularly in response to core devs implementing SWSF.
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:55:05
How about chain B on which transactions never confirm? How much is that worth?
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:26:17
There's ample speculation as to why, but what happens next is simple: we [fire the developers](
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:02:52
A miner could claim to not recognize SW transactions, and therefore be unable to reject them.
Besides, have miners been known to turn away profit for "political" reasons?
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:40:28
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:07:22
Segwit is not active. Any segwit transaction you send now will be spendable by anyone.
If it were active, there is no majority support from miners. So the anyone-can-spend chain wins.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:28:34
"Sure FOO256 is bulletproof, but let's continue accepting SHA256 blocks indefinitely, and implement a soft fork that disguises FOO256 blocks so they still validate correctly on old nodes."
yet people are surprised when it doesn't get unanimous support.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:06:49
For completeness, the paragraphs which mention the blocksize increase:


Miners don't feel it is appropriate to openly oppose Segwit, as it does solve the transaction malleability bug. To them a more straightforward solution is to defer Segwit and first increase the blocksize.


Why increase the blocksize? Because when on-chain transaction fees are kept within reasonable limits, layer-2 solutions become less compelling to users.


Take the international crude oil market for example. When OPEC had a monopoly over the market, they raised prices over 100 USD. This incentivized the research of alternative technologies, namely shale oil mining, thus breaking OPEC oil-producing countries' [??]. Had OPEC maintained a lower price level, e.g. 50 USD, shale oil mining would have been less appealing and likely would not have been commercialized. Now it remains established even though traditional oil-producing countries have suppressed the price to 30 Yuan, much to their own detriment. Miners fear meeting a similar fate.

Spot on. All these mental gymnastics just because some people want blocks to be capped at 1MB.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:21:02


Could someone elaborate or link to more info on why is this so?
If we're referring to the ETH fork following the DAO hack, breaking immutability happens to be *exactly what that HF was designed to do*.
All Bitcoin HFs that have been proposed so far are scalability upgrades, no transactions that are confirmed at the forking point are going to be reversed.

Way too late

Might be true if a bunch of dipshits hadn't done something to piss them off.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:13:29
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:24:26
I see what you mean.
In that case, from SW nodes point of view: we have a crippled chain with only ~25% of the original hash power and ~40 minute block times. How do you keep your remaining miners from jumping back to the majority chain to protect their profits?
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:25:08


Both big blocks and LN will run into the same problem. The difference is whether Bitcoin will be a "peer-to-peer electronic cash system", or a "hub-and-spoke electronic settlement layer".
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:30:34
Didn't you know? Between running `sudo apt-get upgrade` vs. having a non-functional node, most organic people would choose the latter!

Got the same email from my VPS provider last month, replied as false positive and they said they'll forward my comment to CERTSI. Looks like CERTSI hasn't gotten around to fixing things.
For better credibility, consider including a link to the source code showing the relevant domain names:

You're right, we should never change a single line of code in Bitcoin Core ever again because it may cause a fork. /s

Why not just link to a QR code like [this]( in the video description?

That's a long way of saying "just raise the blocksize limit".
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:34:03
Because this is actual progress.

Unfortunately it's not that simple, as there is no unified communication protocol when it comes to LCDs, even over USB. Many de-facto/pseudo-standards exist and there will always be implementation differences between manufacturers that the software needs to be aware of. The closest thing you will find that is pre-compiled is a hardware abstraction layer such as [LCD4Linux]( and [LCDproc]( which you will need to somehow incorporate into your own program to be able to control a supported LCD.
If you want minimal effort, you're better off using RPi-specific LCD accessories such as [PiFace Control &amp; Display]( and the [Adafruit Pi Plate]( as they come with Python libraries and some tutorials to get them up and running. From there it shouldn't be too difficult to write a Python script to periodically query Bitstamp's [API]( and write the result to LCD.
