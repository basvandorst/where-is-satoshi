It means (based on my understanding from the video) that 2.5KiB of data can be used hide the amounts being transferred within a transaction from the verification network (the world).
That same 2.5KiB can then be reused (at 80% efficiency) on any number of transactions again, making the cost about 500B per transaction.

He is right. If the hashrate is 1000/min, that is 5000 for five minutes, and 10000 for ten. For the same security as one ten minute block, you have to wait for two five minute blocks.
Time to first confirmation is reduced, but it still is twice as easy to reorg out of.

No you can't. Nobody (unless perhaps they are running the code in question) will accept your blocks.

This is a great observation.


This is a true statement, but a lot of folks around here will infer that it is the fault of core devs, which I think is false.
If you look back through logs of discussions with devs in the past, long before the block size debate became a hot topic, you'll not find them making any kinds of long term guarantees about the system's future, and you'll never see them claiming it will always be free or cheap to use. You *will* see them emphasizing the limitations of the system, tempering the eagerness of prospective investors, etc.
If you take a dozen news articles (from any time span), you'll likely find a dozen or more technically incorrect statements, implications, or assumptions. Many of these kinds of statements are along the lines of, "bitcoin is cheap, fast, anonymous," and many people have read these statements and assumed they were correct. The article writers were not intentionally misleading, they just lack the technical understanding to be completely accurate because bitcoin is difficult to understand.

Unless, say, relaying is what consumes the bandwidth.

This is a terrific idea -- in the long run defense against every type of attack is important.
This is the only effort to defend bitcoin against legal attacks that I'm aware of at this point.

Google Maps that address... the building looks like a government building. So either Guns Under 500 is sharing a building with the Meriweather County Tax Authority, or they are lying.
Using street view doesn't give the appearance of it being a real store.
