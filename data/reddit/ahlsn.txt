I feel sorry for the regular people in Greece that got screwed up in this but I don't agree with the sentiment to blame EU for it. Greece is a democracy, isn't it? You voted for these politicans. What I remember from when all this uncovered is that Greece had the lowest age of pension in EU and barely anybody payed taxes. Jumping in and out of EU whenever it's comfortable is not really the idea behind the union.

Greece did this on them self. The rest of us EU countries have poured a lot of money into Greece in order to save them. Money we will probably never see again.

You have a 50% chance of being correct. Either it happens or not.

In Sweden we have been able to do transfers like this in local currency person to person instantly on mobile with out fees for a couple of years already.

I heard about Bitcoins back in 2011 when a friend sent me this link [Why I'm putting all my savings into Bitcoin]( I thought I should put some money in but never did.
I have work mates that bought bitcoins in 2013 and made some money before the crash and they still have some left. All this time I never put money in my self until now a week ago.
It's easy to feel regret but it doesn't help. I'm glad I'm in now instead and I've already gained 50% in a week.

You can buy it for market value and sell it for market value. Simple as that.
