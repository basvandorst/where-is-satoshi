Agreed, except when they ban accounts for no reason, like they did to ours just because their bot detected ''bitcoin'' or whatever. We tried fighting the silly claim, but still no luck. If anyone has an idea how to fight this let me know please.

I've been in direct contact with Tor Project guys, and Bitcoin community raised this month more than the total Tor brought in from individuals in July 2018. We should all be proud.
If you can't donate that's fine, spread the word, would be nice if a exchanges or other Bitcoin businesses could help up raise that last $1800 to break the milestone.

Love this one. Quite original.
I have my own version of [Bitcoin artworks in my store]( if anyone is interested.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:44:24
Sweet pic. We have slightly different type of [Bitcoin Xmas sweatshirt]( in our store, though it's printed. 
@_date: 2019-07-16 05:47:25
Not true, a mistake in the article. BTCPay is not related or similar to BitPay in any way other than having 100% compatible API.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:55:55
Awesome progress, been following this for a while. Once it's  live, if you need testers, we'd gladly try it out [in our store]( just pm me.

Howdy Redditors.
I'm part of the BTCPay community, seeing this on the front made my day, especially because of the time some of us invested into BTCPay lately.
I'd like to invite everyone to [join our friendly community on Slack]( where we'll happily answer your questions or just chat about the stuff that can be done. There's also IRC channel  connected to the slack.
Let me share some helpful resources for those who never heard of BTCPay before.
* [BTCPay FAQ]( - provides a very good overview on what is BTCPay and why is it important
* [Merchants Guide to BTCPay]( - gives a bit of info on how BTCPay works.
* [How to create your online store and accept Bitcoin]( through BTCPay - a guide which explains step by step how you can create your e-commerce store in 8 steps and use BTCPay. [There are 18 videos]( if you're adventurous and would like to build your own self-sovereign empire.
* [BTCPay on GitHub](
* [List of stores, charities and free-btcpay hosts]( using BTCPay
Quite briefly, BTCPay Server is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive payments in Bitcoin (on-chain and via the Lightning Network) and altcoins directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.
There are many ways in which you can contribute to an open-source project like BTCPay.
The easiest way is to use the software, provide feedback and report any bugs or issues you or your customers encounter. If you're a developer, you can help us develop and improve the software by contributing on the GitHub. Translating BTCPay into your native language, helping us with documentation writing are ways in which you can help us out, even if you're not a developer or tech-savvy.
Feel free to ask any sort of questions here or on Slack, I'll be checking in a bit later to reply to your queries.
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:11:40
It has certain limitations, such as no Lightning Network and you're depending on their node, but it's still conivinient solution for very small businesses on a shoe-string budget.
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:34:27
I recently updated the FAQ, which is a very good starting point for absolute newbies 
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:17:36
Okay, now you're just embarassing yourself and your service looks even more like a joke. I would never ever trust a company which spreads missinfornation and FUD, not to mention talks about full nodes like they are the issue.
It takes 20days to sync a node? No. It takes 2-5 depending on your setup.
You're spreading FUD to shill your service. Well guess what? With BTCPay I can allow others to attach to my node and receive payments, hosting unlimited amount of stores for free. No middleman, no fees.
You are just scared of BTCPay. You should be.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:49:06
We reached the softcap goal of 10k in 25 hours. Bitcoin community, be proud of what you achieved.
Please, the campaign will keep running for 13 more days, so if you have some spare sats, keep donating to the campaign. Protecting our privacy online requires a lot more, and it would be great if we can surpass that initial goal.
@_date: 2018-09-02 09:25:46
It does not require any sort of registration. You can install it as a plugin from your WordPress site. Dashboard &gt; Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; type "Woocommerce".
You can download it manually and upload to manually 
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:11:42
I remember Nicolas mentioning it a while ago on Slack. Perhaps it can be bundled with BTCPay and reduce the hops for merchants who have to install it themselves. 
It would be good to have an easy way for merchants to use full node wallets.
Anything which reduces the complexity and hops. Most of the store owners on BTCPay Slack use Electrum.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:49:04


Not sure what you're referring to?


In a few days there will be a very easy way of to launch BTCPay in 2 steps and 1 click.


Man you do realize BitPay is  on that list?
Here's a non-shitty list 
EDIT: Okay, after taking a closer look, I see BitPay is not on a list. I also noticed you're from Blockonomics, it's also good payment processor imho.
@_date: 2018-09-28 16:21:23


Not exactly true. Merchants can use free third-party hosts, but there are certain limitations like no Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:08:36
You need to give us a little bit more info:
* Online or brick and mortar business?
* Do you need POS
* Do you want to accept Bitcoin or convert it into fiat after your customer pays?
* Subscription business?
There are many options, and you gave us so little information that it's hard for us to save you some time and direct you properly.
Give more details for better answers.
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:49:08
Gosh, so many lame recommendations here.


BTCPay is the only processor which meets all the requirements.
I wrote quite a lot of stuff and recorded some videos, so here's step by step.
* [Start here and inform yourself - FAQ](
* Decide if you want to run your own BTCPay server or use a third-party host
* [Install BTCPay WP plugin](
* [Connect your Woo store with a third-party host](
* [Connect BTCPay to your wallet](
* [Test payments before going live](
* [Install your own BTCPay instance]( (optional, but recommended)
* [Helpful BTCPay and WooCoommerce links](
* [Join the community on Slack if you get stuck somewhere](
@_date: 2018-09-05 13:32:52
I'd love to see this integrated into BTCPay Server somehow, would help merchants rely on their node. 
Thanks for all the work you do!
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:38:29
Hahahah. Fuck off you shilling piece of scum. It's BTCPay not BitPay.


What on earth are you talking about? BTCPay is a separate "site"


You can host it on 5$ VPS. It's far cheaper than you middleman taking fees from merchants per transaction. Plus people can use free BTCPay third-party host and receive payments to their wallet.


THAT'S BAD? AAAAAA. Businesses running full node is a fucking priority you ignorant shill. But if a small business does not want to they can use a third-party host. No maintenance required, except for updating BTCPay when the new version is out.


NO. Your private keys are never-ever updated to the server. 
I had to reply to you, because you're just spammer, liar and shill spreading FUD to try to shill your own lame service.
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:22:47
Just register, first created account is admin :-)
@_date: 2018-09-08 10:01:12
You'd have to give us a little bit more context. What are you trying to do with BitPay?
If you need a payment processor and privacy is a concern, as u/belcher_ mentioned, give BTCPay a try.
Just 3 hours ago I submitted a pull request (not yet merged) - [BTCPay FAQ]( should give you a pretty good overview of why is it different and how it works.
No fiat conversion though, but since you're concerned about the privacy, you do know that there's no privacy with BTC-fiat unless it's a cash transaction.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:38:24

Supporting smaller charities would be good. Damn, you're doing awesome work. We donate a portion of profit of our btc store to BitGive also. Felt quite awesome about it until I saw you donated half million to them, wow. Keep it up, world needs more people like you.

Awesome! Will add you to the list.
@_date: 2018-09-27 15:51:03
It's actually the first payment processor which implemented LN ;) 
You can use BTCPay to launch LND or c-lightning node, it's quite easy. Soon to become even easier.
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:53:04
It's very unclear what you're trying to do, but you can use BTCPay payment button (invoice created with each click on the button on the amount you determined).
For more complex e-commerce type of business, you can use Woocommerce and BTCPay 
1 address for 1 friend can work, but it's tiresome to manage, you need an invoicing system, and that's what BTCPay is. 
If you just simply explained what sort of business it is, it would be way easier to properly direct you.
It looks like you're running some sort of subscription business. That feature is on to-do list for BTCPay afaik.
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:54:07
[With this setup]( you can run your own BTCPay (Bitcoin Full Node and LND) for 8.8$. If you have experience with VPS, you can run it on even cheaper VPS [Minimal Requirments here](
You can't run it on Shared Hosting.  You can host your site on shared and BTCPay on a VPS.
But if you're on a budget, there are free [third-party hosts]( which allow you to connect your store to their BTCPay Server. Here's an example of how it works for [WooCommerce]( 
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:15:24
Join the slack and ask questions there 
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:43:53

@_date: 2018-08-19 06:59:36
Yes it does. Both LND and c-lightning implementations.
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:49:21
Let me know if you make your store. You can sell service not only products ;)
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:21:38
SiteGround (hosting I used) has a 1-click deploy. If you take away the customization, it comes down to doing the deployment, installing the theme and connecting to BTCPay by registering with a free host and connecting it via the plugin.
This tutorial, however, goes into detail, explains to people how to create products, variations, contact pages, customize the appearance and so on. Wanted the full experience. I agree that less complexity for all of this, in general, is needed. But you can't build a business with a single button, yet. 
If you have any feedback, let me know.
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:12:36
A system that is free, open-source and reduces the complexity for merchants and increases the privacy (no address re-use). Yeah, you're right. Let's agree we disagree and move on.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:28:32
This is my attempt to help the adoption.

From what I understand, you'd like to know how Opendime works? I wrote a [comprehensive guide and review of Opendime 3.0]( with plenty of illustrations, I'm sure that that'll be enough to understand it.

When ICO?
With all due respect Cobra, even though it looks better than earlier mockups, it's just not in the spirit of Bitcoin.
I don't like the price ticker remove that one. The overall website experience is not focused on the content. 
I remember when I first started browsing.org I was thinking how simple and to the point it is.  There were not distracting stuff. I consumed content because it was well-written, organized and without distractions. "It tackles such a complex topic, but the website is so easy to consume and jump from one article to another" - those were my thoughts.
I think you're missing your target audience and as someone mentioned, it looks like ICO marketing bullshit. Educate, don't market it. The typical Bitcoin.org user is a newbie who needs to be focused and not overwhelmed. Like it's not enough that Bitcoin itself is complex for newbies, let's make the website make it look ever more complex and out-of-space.
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:47:56
Oh wow, 100 stores! I guess I'm the one that should be thanking you - thank you, for helping the adoption.
If my tutorial helps a fraction of people you've helped I'd be at peace.
EDIT: I'd love to see the docs you have, feel free to pm me if you don't want to share it here.

I know that the author of the art is at the Consensus now, so I'll chime in.
You can read more about the artwork on [CryptoPop blog post.](




I know how much time it took u/helloluis to create this as we've been in touch ever since he started sketching it. 
I love how he emphasized and honored artists like u/cryptograffiti and coin_artist which are the inspiration for all of us.
The author sells this as a framed posted, which [you can buy here](
In collaboration with u/helloluis we at BitcoinShirt.co launched his awesome illustration on two products which you can pay in Bitcoin and on second-layer on a Lightning Network :
* [T-Shirt](
* [15 oz Mug](
We're seeing so much great artists latelely in the sub! 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:27:39
Dope art man. Like many I was a bit suspicious when this was first posted but after checking your site and insta it looked legit. 
Dunno if you ever decide to make digital art, we can put it on some merch we sell in [our store](
You can also set up a Lightning Network donation, would be dope and would increase your donations I'm sure since plenty of guys here are looking for a ways to test the LN and send some satoshi over.
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:31:17
Thanks! Been working quite a lot on our node liquidity and connectivity. So far there are no issues for a higher-valued items on the LN, processed a few of those orders without problems.
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:19:27
You don't understand how BTCPay works nor how things work on merchant side.
You're saying me it's easier for me to manually check email, reply to a customer with an address and verify that they made a payment compared to my customer checking out and me getting a notification to ship the order with payment arriving directly to my wallet P2P. 
[Start here to understand BTCPay]( a bit better. It's a guide I wrote. I'm not saying the method your friend is using is bad or wrong, I'm just telling you it does not work well if a store has more than a few orders. It's a nightmare to manage.
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:04:00
Thanks for the kind words, much appreciated ��
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:30:09
You're an inspiration. Thanks for everything you've done and good luck Pine!
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:23:38
Thanks! If you or someone you know end up with making a store that accepts BTC by following it, please let me know, it would make my day :-)
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:07:39


There's no middleman. With BTCPay you're either your own processor and the payments go directly into your wallet, no fees, no third-party. So you don't understand :) Read the guide I linked above if you're interested in learning more.
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:43:59
You have no idea how happy I am to hear that. If you're having any troubles, just ping me, I'll be happy to help out. It's a new tech, and we're all learning. People also use Eclair wallet quite a lot.
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:07:18
tl;dr In past, hosting BTCPay server required $60 on Azure per month, which was a huge barrier for smaller shop owners. 
Serious progress was made in optimizing the software and pruning nodes. 
The article provides step by step instructions on how to launch BTCPay Server for as little as 5.14$ per month (you can pay the particular hosting provider in Bitcoin).
If you have a store on one of the following platforms: Woocommerce, Drupal, Magneto or PrestaShop and would like to learn more about BTCPay and how it works, you can start with a [BTCPay guide]( I wrote a few months back, which I still try to keep up to date.
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:45:44
Well, it really depends how you look at it. For me, HODL marks the belief in the whole protocol. The point of this specific poster was to show how hodling pays off, to show that this is a marathon.
I admit it, we probably can relaunch the poster itself and improve it -  feel free to post some ideas if you wish. I was on my phone so I just downloaded the poster from our store and posted it.
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:11:21
Of course, you can do it that way, but if you had more than a few orders a day paid in Bitcoin, it's a messy system.
BTCPay offers a complete, automated invoicing system among many many other things. It's like a swiss knife of payment processing. Has so many features.
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:53:52
I mentioned in the video that you need to enter the URL property, including the https when using a host. Glad you figured it out. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:05:52

@_date: 2018-05-01 17:35:24

I know it's not a perfect product showcase, but I'm quite new to video making and editing. Watched few tutorials online and started. 
The camera I used is Sony A6000 which I borrowed from a friend. I've used two type of lens for this one, a close-up, and the pancake lens. Recorded it in the daylight for better light, but the mistake here is that I had no tripod, so it was all recorded in hand and turned out a bit shaky, which I tried to fix in post-production.
Anyway, feedback is welcome. If there are any experienced videographers here, please feel free to chime in. It's far from those corporate product showcases.
More images and the info on the backpack can be found in my online store 
EDIT: I'm not quite sure but I think that the music I used is a bit too aggressive for some, not really sure if it even fits in the showcase video.
@_date: 2018-08-31 21:53:29
BTCPay generates the address out of your xpub key. I used Electrum to generate a private key and import the public key (xpub) into BTCPay so that it can derive addresses from it.

I'm posting this here, mostly because I still see Redditors complain about btcpay being expensive to run, hard to deploy etc, hopefully, this clears some confusion, it's pretty basic, nothing too technical.
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:16:48
Thanks, was supposed to be a light read. I actually now think that some misconceptions may come from outdated [Guide to BTCPay]( I posted in thus sub, months ago, should probably update it. :)
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:45:55
Woke up today and decided to make a short but boring video to try to explain the concept behind btcpay in under a minute. (ended up 1:04)
I really have no idea if this kind of "boring" format is confusing or useful. I thought it may be fun, but not so sure.
Anyway, hopefully, it clears out some things, let me know, if people like it, I'll continue to add these to btcpay's youtube, wanted to add a few more on the software architecture, etc.
Used just photoshop to create motion. I borrowed the inspiration from the guy on youtube called savjee.
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:33:42
One thing you guys should know (I am not saying that's the case here) but Bitcoin businesses are heavily censored on ad platforms. You can't post your ad on Google, Facebook, Reddit if it's Bitcoin business without having to go through the hell of appeals, support tickets/cases, etc , even then you'll be rejected in most cases.
I think we as a community should encourage merchants and point out how they can improve. Let's try to help and not attack right away, most of the people who accept BTC lack knowledge.
@_date: 2019-03-31 11:09:38
I said already, just photoshop :)
@_date: 2019-03-19 08:20:06
Nice, let's hope they keep that promise. Still, their current setup is terrible, but at least a step forward.
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:36:45
I think this release shows that BTCPay is not just a payment processor.
It is definitely a tech-stack on top of which enterprise can build things or individuals can use as a self-sovereign tool at home. A platform.
If any of you guys have questions about the new release or want to contribute, there are tons of us on [chat.btcpayserver.org]( willing to help you.
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:51:17
Actually, there are what we call third-party providers that integrated themselves that allow you to do that if you enable it.
But, it's a bit pricey since they take fees (customer pays with CC you get BTC) and also the UI there is quite bad. There's been a discussion about it [here]( we're trying to figure out a way to allow people to do this in an easier way.
Though if your issue is privacy, introducing a trusted third-party during this process won't do any good, quite the opposite. I'm not sure but on your end you may have to do KYC with providers such as CoinSwitch or Changelly to be able to use it, I've never personally used it but there are people who do. It should be under Server Settings &gt; Services &gt; Third Party Providers then you need to pair the API etc.
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:03:56

Actually fiat conversion is possible, through [payment forwarders,]( exchanges that offer xpubkey (I don't know any that does) or [BTC-Transmuter]( which is still in early alpha.
If there are people that want to help us iron out the transmuter, feel free to join BTCPay community chat or provide feedback in appropriate gitub repo. MrKukks, who created the Tranmsuter recently [did a presentation]( on, it in case anyone is interested. We still don't advertise it as released, it's in development, so use it for testing and on your own risk for now.
It's important to mention that with btcpay it's your keys always, so fiat conversion was always possible, just had to be manual or figured out on merchant's end.
@_date: 2019-03-19 07:32:48
Unfortunately, the title is misleading.
* They are still using BitPay on their /donate page when you click "Want to donate Bitcoin, Stock, or via snail mail?" with 
* They're now re-using addresses, which is terrible.
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:56:50
Transmuter, like btcpay is self-hosted open-source software. You as a merchant would have to do KYC with your exchange, provide liquidity and transmuter would then forward it and auto sell for you. It basically automates funds for you, you can send to cold storage, send % here, % there, it's way more than a way to convert to fiat.
We provide you the tools, it's up to you to figure out how to KYC or not and customize for your own use-case.

Agreed. That's why at the end the article we sent an open invitation to all providers offering free help during the process as we did with LunaNode.
If anyone knows a hosting provider that might be interested in creating similar deployment wizard, let us know! The entire tool is open-source on GitHub. Kudos to LunaNode for pushing open-source approach as we never asked them to do it.
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:40:15


Actually, there's already a [video tutorial on how to do this](
Basically, you just have to deploy BTCPay and wait for it to sync. (Make sure to select LND from the Wizard). You can download Zap wallet. And [follow this guide]( You basically have to copy paste a configuration from BTCPay into Zap.
Bam you're using Lightning Network via your own node!

Yes. BTCPay is the first payment processor that implemented Lightning Network payments and currently support (c-lightning and LND). Use the demo links to check it out.
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:18:47
Where did you come up with that number? It's 8.8$/month with this particular host. Devs did an insane amount of optimization. When BTCPay started the easiest way to deploy cost 65$/month via Azure. Read the article.
If you're a technical user you can use whatever VPS you want which meets the minimal requirements and deploy with a docker or other offered method.
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:47:33
This is now fixed. Ty.
@_date: 2018-10-03 10:58:13
Not really sure what you mean?
BTCPay can be set on any VPS [see this](
If you're a VPS provider, we'd be happy to give you a hand, though LunaNode script is also open-source.

BTCPay comes with a full node bundled in already, while you can connect a remote node, it's way easier to use the one that's bundled in btcpay. Here's an better look at what's behind the scenes [

Use Google Chrome, that's the one working with U2F and Ledger. You can try Firefox but I don't think it works correctly (at least it did not work for me, even after enabling U2F in about:config).
I think Yubico deleted that page. We should probably say use Google Chrome only if you want to use the internal wallet with Ledger.

BTCPay is a fork of BitPay.
EDIT: Actually, it's more an open-source implementation of BitPay, that exposes almost identical API (so that people can transfer easily).
@_date: 2019-11-03 10:40:08
Consider setting up BTCPay Server on Raspberry Pi.  
It's a wallet, a lightning node and you can connect to it remotely over the Tor. It also has bunch of other things bundled in and pretty decent UI  imo. [

Hey, Shopify is one of the most requested integrations. 
I'm afraid it's very hard to get into a centralized and closed system like Shopify. They expect you to be a company. BTCPay is not a company. It's a free and open-source payment processor, and they just don't get that. We had one guy who tried to somehow register BTCPay via is own company and plugin for Shopify, but we never heard from him.
 
If there's someone here who can help us with Shopify process, please let me know. So the answer your question, currently BTCPay does not have Shopify integration.
Also, if there are people who would like to help with OpenCart, Easy Digital Download, and other CMS feel free to join on Slack.
@_date: 2018-10-02 20:35:16
Hey man! Been fried myself, know what you mean.
So BTCPay is an open-source and free payment processor for merchants. But it's also a tool regular people use (to receive donations, use LN, soon chain-swaps, and God knows what Nicolas Dorier will implement). 
I am not 100% sure, but isn't Eclair using their LN node? Or they allow users to connect their own nodes? Not quite sure as it's been a while I used it. Nevertheless, to support BTCPay - the easiest way is to use the software, provide feedback and report any bugs or issues you or maybe if you're merchant your customers encounter. If you're a developer, you can help us develop and improve the software by contributing on the GitHub. Translating BTCPay into your native language, helping us with documentation writing are ways in which you can help us out, even if you're not a developer or tech-savvy.
@_date: 2018-10-13 20:17:08
The thing with books is they quickly get outdated. Bitcoin tech moves quite quickly, so online resources are better.
Besides mentioned resources and books, one that covers quite a lot of stuff you asked (and is quite up-to-date) is [Owning Bitcoin]( by Bitzuma blog. It's not a light read, but not boring either. It's probably the most underestimated books out there.
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:26:32
It really depends what you're trying to accomplish? BTCPay is not only LND+Full node tool, but it's also a complete merchant system and a payment processor, so a bit more complex and versatile.
If your goal is LN on a hardware device, go with Stadicus's tutorial.
There are people selling [BTCPay on hardware devices]( but there are also free tutorials [this one]( and [this one](
I'd also recommend you read [BTCPay FAQ](

You can currently use POS or Payment button for fixed invoices. In Apps, create a list of items "Service 1, Service 2, Service 3. Each time a customer clicks they will have a new invoice.

My point is that the value might go down or stagnate if people do not spend it. I am a newbie , so perhaps I am under the wrong impression that people are buying crypto currency as an investment rather than to use it for what it really is. Just trying to get opinions on this.

Howdy Reddit! One more of my posts about BTCPay.
It all began with my Merchants Guide to BTCPay. The general feedback was that the free and open-source payment software is cool, but the installation is complicated. With [this Deployment Web Wizard]( we solved that issue. If you have the time I would appreciate any feedback that you might have. 
Now you can deploy full Bitcoin node and LND in under a minute. You can use [Zap wallet integration]( and have your own Lightning Node.
Let me share some helpful resources for those who never heard of BTCPay before.
* [BTCPay FAQ]( - provides a very good overview on what is BTCPay and why is it important
* [Merchants Guide to BTCPay]( - gives a bit of info on how BTCPay works.
* [How to create your online store and accept Bitcoin]( through BTCPay - a guide which explains step by step how you can create your e-commerce store in 8 steps and use BTCPay. [There are 18 videos]( if you're adventurous and would like to build your own self-sovereign empire.
* [BTCPay on GitHub](
* [List of stores, charities and free-btcpay hosts]( using BTCPay
Quite briefly, BTCPay Server is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which allows you to receive payments in Bitcoin (on-chain and via the Lightning Network) and altcoins directly, with no fees, transaction cost or a middleman.
Feel free to ask any sort of questions here or on [BTCPay Slack]( I'll be checking the post regularly throughout the day.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:32:18
Would it make any sense to have my payments directly to a wallet and then load the BTC to a credit card and pay my suppliers? It's probably not as automated as it looks, but it eliminates the third party which some Bitcoin users might not trust. Just an idea, not sure if it's possible to make it work.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:46:12
That's quite interesting. Inflation tax. Not sure if that solves the problem though.
I began learning and am fascinated by Bitcoin and other crypto currencies, but I just don't see how they will take off if nobody is spending. Wouldn't lack of transactions make mining useless or am I wrong?
Perhaps people are actually spending?
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:07:22
Burner? I think it's more for security 2FA or something, but you can easily bypass that. One of the VPS we tried along the way actually asked for the ID!

I'm not sure what your suggestion is, but you're probably referring to fiat conversion. That's something that we talked about on Slack. The plan is to create an easy pluggable way in which exchanges can connect and merchants can choose local exchanges so that their bitcoin can be converted in full or partially into fiat to mitigate the volatility risk. I'm not sure when it's coming.
BTCPay integrates into many e-commerce systems and is displayed next to fiat, paypal, etc if that's what you're referring to.
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:08:45
Theoretically yes, but the updates take only a few seconds anyway, so I don't think it's worth the hassle.

Welcome to the BTCPay Family!
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:44:12
Thanks so much for an in-depth reply, it really provides some valuable information on how to approach this "issue". It'll be a lot more complicated than I expected, but if I do a research and a math properly I might be able to find a solution and avoid third-party merchants. It kinda kills the whole point of a BitCoin if we have to use such service. However, if the costs of BitPay are lower than this whole process (having a direct payment to an HD wallet and than transfer to an exchange, withdraw the money in USD, upload it to PayPal to pay the supplier) I might go with that, though I'd really hate to do it.
Thanks once again, if you happen to have any other ideas, I'd love to hear back from you.

Well, BTCPay comes with LN node built in. Connecting your BTCPay to a remote node is a bit complicated and not really documented anywhere. I'd recommend that you just self-host your instance.

Appreciate the tips, if you have some other suggestions, I'd really like to hear them.
@_date: 2019-08-28 11:40:19
It's easier those running all those things separately. 
Because it makes no sense, btcpay comes with things bundled in, it's really useless /hard for non-tech savvy to host things separately.
You can also buy nodl and similar hardware devices that already have btcpay installed, it's really not that hard to self-host on RPI, provided that you have some basic RPI knowledge.
@_date: 2019-10-10 13:06:03
It's on by default, they forgot to turn it off it seems, we're disusing to disable it by default in the next version, while some merchants find this useful (those that don't have CMS), for charities it mostly makes no sense to have it. You can of course enter anything, but it's not a good UX for sure.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:03:24

@_date: 2019-08-17 09:57:55
You can easily identify the payments on the blockchain. However, for merchants, you need an automated payment processor that will do this for you. [This]( video explains that in under a minute. Then, [this]( video explains how btcpay works under the hood.

[Web wallet in BTCPay]( relies on your own full node,  requires xpub only, even if compromised, your keys are offline, since it only needs xpubkey and uses a hardware wallet to sign a transaction. It's probably not a typical wallet a newbie would use, but definitely those points are not valid for it.

It's not BIP70. It's a payment request that ties all of the invoices to it. Each time you click the button, it generates a new invoice and ties makes sure rates are correct. Give it a try, it makes more sense to see it in action that way :)

Depending on what kind of website?
You can use payment requests without having a website, just deploy btcpay server and share links. There are plugins that allow your to connect your BTCPay to CMS, like WordPress, Presta, Magento, etc. See [plugins list](
The easiest way to test btcpay is to use our demo or some of the [third-party hosts]( If you want to be self-sovereign and get all the features, you can [self-host it]( and [launch it in 1-click](
For e-commerce store, I wrote a gigantic article that teaches people how to [make a website from scratch + use btcpay]( (there are also [19 videos I recorded]( it's really for newbies and teaches every single detail)
For blogs, you can use WordPress + Lightning publisher to charge for the article, [demo here]( [tutorial here](
For donations, you can use payment buttons  [demo]( [tutorial]( ), or even customize web point of sale app to get tips, [demo]( [tutorial](

You're 15 and interested in Bitcoin means your very intelligent for your age.
Bitcoin itself, unlike banks does not care about age, race or anything, it does not discriminate.
 
Everyone can own it, regardless of age, race, etc.
I would recommend that you do some reading first. Bitcoin.org is a great starting point, you have pretty good guides in the sidebar of this sub.
Once you understand Bitcoin, the easiest way would be either to use your parents credit card/paypal and buy it online (check the sidebar for recommendation) or to buy it via localbitcoins.com as u/haroldcatch said. In that case make sure to have someone older with you when making the transaction.
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, it's a technology which once you understand you'll be thrilled. I understand that you're young and want to get fast into this, but you should probably do a research.
You can also watch aantonop on YouTube.
Hope this helps.

I've seen those battery charging heat-mugs, those are very neat, I have an idea of what I want, but it might be hard to find a partial heat-activated mug or whatever thse are :)
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:41:04
Behind in what way?
BTCPay literally gives you a technology to become OpenNode or any other processor and process payments for others if you want. I don't see any of them as competition in any way.
This PR has been on GitHub for more than 2 months, we just merged it now. Many other processors have something similar already. I actually got inspired by Blockonomics feature when I opened an issue on GitHub 4-5 months ago.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:18:59
Just a tip, tell him to add Bitcoin accepted here in the footer for instance. And also if he can make it clearer in the checkout that would be nice.
Good job for educating your friend!

I know some guys might if they're allowed to use this as a phone wallpaper, and the answer is absolutely. I made this design for my Bitcoin Store and the artwork posters I sell, but you guys are allowed to use it non-commercially. As the matter a fact I have a whole collection of these I made for free use and phone wallpapers check out this post  
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:10:28
Nice artwork fellow artist!
I'm not sure which software you're using for your website, but you can accept BTC directly, there are bunch of integration out there. This will reduce the hassle of customer having to send you screen shoot. We use one such integration in our Bitcoin store and it works really great. 
We have some cryptoposter ourselves you can check them here 
Good luck and please think about integrating BTC payments, your customers will appreciate it, I know ours did.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:23:13
This is not about the specific example ffs. People (especially newbies) should be aware that there are scammers out there and that they should be careful. Let's post another Rollercoaster guy meme instead.

Does BitPay share data with Chainalysis?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:11:02
From what I see there are two videos on youtube one cca 55 min, this one I shared is 1 hour 28min.
I've never hired a translator, but it would be great if we can find it online for free, if not, if there are few more people interested maybe we can gather up and pay. It's just an idea for now, not ready to finance this all by myself.
The doc seems really well-made and it's probably something educational.

This is awesome news, I really love when small business owners accept BTC. 
Best of luck to your friend. Any idea how he handles the payments in the checkout?
As a merchant accepting Bitcoin myself, I know it can be tricky to set it up, depending on the website platform.
We're using CoinGate on [our website]( and what I really like about them is that they allow us to transfer Bitcoin to our HD wallet, do not need to convert to fiat right away.

Roger underestimated  John. He did not expect someone way smarter, better prepared than him in the debate. Richard H had too much of a respect for Ver in their debate.

u/Bitcoin-Yoda have you been using this plugin? We've been thinking about adding it but it looks kinda outdated. Not really sure how secure it is and if it takes any middleman fees?
One of the reasons we're using third party is ability to accept multiple coins, coingate allows us 30+ coina integration through ShapeShift.

Hooray, thanks once again! :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:05:03
Like you I became interested into Bitcoin as an investment or getting rich quick scheme. I believe 99% of people in this sub did.
I would recommend that you first explore this awesome technology we have. Learn, learn and learn.
Once you become aware of what it is, how it works and what are it's possibilities you will not care nor look at it as an investment. You'll see it's the thing that can change the world, and you'll buy Bitcoins because who the fuck does not want to be the part of an  ecosystem which can change the fucking world, right?
So, start with the links in the sidebar. I'd recommend Bitcoin.org, plenty of easy-to-understand info for newbies there.
Invest in knowledge first, than play with your 10K.
Welcome and good luck.

Today we released a new version of BTCPay 1.0.3.65:
The highlight of the release is a brand-new feature called - Payment Request. 
This is a new type of time-sensitive invoice pages built into BTCPay that allow you to get paid in cryptocurrency just by sharing a simple URL.
To understand the feature better, we made a video 
If you're an existing BTPay user, to update go to Server Settings &gt; Maintenance &gt; Update.
For those who have no idea what BTCPay is but want to give it a quick try, [we have a demo server](
1. Register account
2. Create a store
3. Add wallet xpubkey (no private keys, public key, your keys your btc)
4. Create a payment request
BTCPay is an open-source, self-hosted Bitcoin payment processor. You can deploy it everywhere from [VPS in a cloud to Rasberry Pi](
Anyway, feel free to explore it and if you have any questions, feel free to ping me to answer them. We also have a great community on [Mattermost]( and [Telegram](
Really excited about this new feature. If you have any feedback, please share it, it'll be very helpful for us to further improve it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:46:55
You can try OpenBazaar.

We actually had normal BIP70 support, not the loco one. 
Tagging u/NicolasDorier to explain the reasoning we removed it. 
My guess is because nobody used it. I'm really not familiar, he'll explain it better.

* How much it costs? It's free. [See this](
* For physical stores, you can use the [Point of Sale app]( or integrate into existing infrastructure.
Nothing has to be purchased from btcpay, you just use it like you use Bitcoin, BTCPay is an open-source software, not a company.
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:10:29
A few days ago I posted [BTCPay simply explained]( while it explained how BTCPay is different, it did not touch what happens under the hood.
So I decided to record a little bit of technical video which explains stuff from deploying btcpay to receiving payment.
I hope you guys will like it. I tried to explain it in plain English, but if something is unclear, let me know and I'll try to explain it.
@_date: 2019-12-11 08:10:13
Thanks for all the love &amp; support Muffin. BTCPay Server grew from one man hobby project to a community, only because of r/Bitcoin, this is where it all started and  people on this sub still direct other people to the project daily.

No, BTCPay did not sponsor or ask for this in any way. We were surprised as everyone else and found out about it like everybody else - on Twitter. Russel is using BTCPay in his store, so he liked it and decided to promote it, completely on his own.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:28:32
Thanks for sharing this, saw it on Twitter earlier. 
"Just before someone says this is not for an average  Joe, BTCPay is hard is install"... 
It's not; this is just one of the many available methods.
Check out the deployment page 
There's everything from 1-click web deployment for absolute newbies to deploying BTCPay on your own hardware like a badass.
I'll add the link in the docs to this excellent article, fantastic effort.

To be precise, depending on your dishwasher, you'll be safe with the "top shelf", it's actually drying that can mess things up. 
So we recommend hand-washing them, and once you see how fun it is you'll want to wash it that way regardless.
If you're like really lazy, you can wash it in, it's just not recommended.
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:00:50
Well, I don't think this plugin is convenient for e-commerce, it's more like ebook sales or other things, though I haven't tried it. Check BTCPay; I wrote a decent [guide for merchants on Reddit]( about it a while ago, you might find it handy, also join forkbitpay on slack, plenty of merchants there who are accepting Bitcoin directly, with no intermediates. 
No matter what people say, there are customers who want to spend BTC; merchants are willing to accept it and spread the adoption without just converting it right away.
I hope to see your idea becoming a reality, good luck. I'd be happy to spend my crypto once it's up. Be aware that it's still risky, but I would never change it for anything, I wake up every morning not feeling like a merchant, I'm feeling like a part of groundbreaking technology and community, that's huge. Start small, you'll adapt easier and faster to the changes.

To tell you the truth, the best way to try is to actually use it. It's still a bit hard for those who aren't tech savvy, but it's so much fun, you'll understand it much better that way, at least that's how I learned the best.

I'm sure the reply would be like what most hardware wallet companies say, if you can make it work we will integrate it. 
I'm not a part of the programming team, I'm just assuming this can be the case. Of course, there is an option of going through services like ShapeShift, etc and convert coins, but I'm really just listing the options here, none of these are implemented nor considered at this moment. Just saw this [request on Github](

Yup, fixed again, ty.
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:30:38
u/btchip said on numerous occasions that they'd be happy to transfer to BTCPay or similar processors when and if they find everything that fits their current ecosystem without making any breaking changes. Big companies are far less-flexible and I completely understand why they're so slow and haven't moved yet.
BTCPay has everything they need (compatible API), except fiat integration which is, it appears essential for Ledger (because of accounting and taxes as they said).  We're progressing quite a lot on that fiat-integration, just be patient.
Feel free to join us on Slack anytime, I'm sure we can make it happen and at the same time save you guys some money because there are no fees and you'll be providing better privacy for your customers as well.
Oh yes and BTCPay internal wallet directly integrates with Ledger.
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:55:58
Nope, via [our store]( We accept Bitcoin and also payments via the Lightning Network.

Hey OP thanks for re-posting it. Last time this failed to get bigger traction as apparently, it was more important how someone's wife mixes [hodling with hatching]( which really pissed me off.

Regardless we managed to change the mindset of 2 or 3 stores.

@_date: 2018-03-15 23:35:49
Uh, you seem to mix the payment processor with the CMS. But to answer you're a question, you'll certainly know when the customer paid for the order, it's market automatically as paid inside Woocommerce. I know, if you're not actually a merchant this explanation makes not much sense. 
Take a look at the guide I wrote for newbie (from a newbie)  might be able to clear some confusion.

BTCPay is not a business.

Yeah, you have to toggle "advanced" mode (it's [hidden]( like Easter Egg), which is, again console, hopefully, Spark's UI will improve in future. As the matter a fact, I've noticed a few issues about the UI and on-chain wallet on their GitHub.
I've passed along your feedback to devs, they all found it very helpful.

@_date: 2018-03-23 18:55:56
We set a the test item yesterday in our store, so far c-lightning to lightning was smooth, not so much with an LND if you want to test here's a [dummy item]( In theory you can use it for any other item, but please don't since we're still testing the implementation and all of our other items are over 10$. If you do try it out let me know if you experienced any problems as feedback is crucial here.
@_date: 2019-01-31 14:56:26
This tutorial is experimental. It is also not made for complete newbies. You should have some basic command line  and WordPress knowledge. The goal is to have a simple, small store with a few products. This method for the specific hosting provider also uses a method of validating a full node by fast syncing it from a trusted node. 
Please approach this tutorial as a proof of concept. It works, but if you can find a VPS that has a little bit more power than the one used, you can have the woocommerce + btcpay on a single server without having to sync from a trusted full node.
Anyway, if you're a newbie and have no idea how to customize the store afterward add products, take a look at the [video series and article I posted]( a while ago.
If you have any questions, fire away.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:51:59
Besides those mentioned, once you get a bit of understanding, I strongly recommend the Owning Bitcoin by the guy who's the author of Bitzuma blog. An advanced read, but in-depth and targets some quite complicated issues. It can only be bought on his blog. Excellent book IMHO.
You can read few articles from his blog to see if you like the style and how he explains technicalities. 
While I read most of the important books about Bitcoin, I'd recommend that you use plenty of online resources available at  Jameson also has a book list, so there you have it.
Books are great, but the technology is changing too fast, so some info in the books might be outdated.

Awesome. In all honesty that depends on the jurisdiction quite a lot, but, you should write a blog post about it and explain how bigger companies deal with problems Ledger mentioned.
It would be something beneficial for the entire community and may motivate other people to do the same.

This is not wallet vs. server issue. This is your server vs. someone else's server issue. In both cases, there's a wallet. Just in the case of BTCPay, you're the owner of the private keys to that wallet, not a third party.


In the case of BTCPay, there is room for this. Since its open-source, I'm sure people can contribute to their integrations. There is already litecoin support. 
If you can be a bit clearer on what sort of platform this is happening and what do you mean by "more coins" I can be a bit more specific.
@_date: 2018-03-13 07:56:12
This is a good list 
Also bitcoin.org
Andreas videos as mentioned
If you like books : ''The Internet of Money","Digital Gold" and once you get through the basics, I really enjoyed "Owning Bitcoin", also "Mastering Bitcoin"
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:30:56
Could you be more specific about what parts need a bit of work? BTCPay devs are quite opened to feedback, recently there was a remarkable thread where a user pointed out the flaws.
To be honest, I'd more like to see "Roast BTCPay" threads than this, for developers such feedback is far more important than the praise, not saying it does not feel good, but critiques improve the software.
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:04:22
Good idea - added. 
Feel free to add more suggestions, I'll keep editing it.

u/btchip now that we're at it, it would be really helpful if you can roll out that Firefox fix that'd allow peeps to use Nano S and FF with the internal wallet.
And if at any time you have a free dev feel free to send them our way to help us improve the UX/UI (seems you have some good people in that field) or even [Internal wallet](
IMO, if bigger companies can't use BTCPay at this point, any form of dev help would really help us improve and adapt the software at an even faster pace.

I am not sure why I even tried it. I hate it also. 
Yes, my account was funded by using the credit card. I thought about that as the last solution. They are indeed keeping my money for over 3 weeks now and I am unable to close the account and get it back, unable to contact them without getting robot reply, really frustrating.
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:14:31
Excellent. It's late in my timezone, and I'm calling it a night. I'll re-read all of your comments in the morning fresh, and I'll pass on the feedback to devs as there are some great suggestions here.


I completely agree. Improving the UI is something we discussed in the community, I think it'll be done at some point for sure.


Spot on. Again, there are devs working on a new BTCPay API, since BitPay's is not good enough,  that's why the lack of documentation, we just say people go read BitPay's docs for now.


So btcpay uses noseedbackup, so you can’t back up your LN wallet.
This is because in the Lightning Network there’s still no solution for backing up funds in channels (yet, but it's coming soon afaik) just in your on-chain wallet.
If BTCPay provided a way to back up the LN wallet, it would provide a false sense of security to users, since most of the funds in LN are in channels anyway. Imagine someone being confident that he can simply delete everything. So for now, we just scare the shit out of users with warnings and we really do our best to educate about the risks trough documentation and UI. I must say so far it worked.


Correct, LN and regular store on-chain wallet are separate for now. 
For c-lightning specifically, there's now a very slick UX with Spark wallet, [check it out]( It allows you to control your c-lightning right from the btcpay.No need to  SSH and it just works. However, I agree that at some point LN wallet and store wallet should unify. That's coming soon on wallets like Electrum, etc so I'm sure we can do the same. Right now it's just best to warn users that LN is alpha and to be careful when playing.
I wish you the best of luck. Let's hope in a few years things will change with adoption, it's still the early days whether we like it or not, the adoption needs to come organically. Even though i said it few times, thanks for taking time to provide detailed feedback, it helps devs improve BTCPay.
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:41:55
Lucky  on the list :)
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:45:43


I don't see the purpose in discussing with you. Thanks for the feedback and gtfo.
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:05:28
Great feedback. Thanks once again.
It looks like you believe in BTC, but your customers don't quite understand it or don't want to spend it.
What's interesting to me personally, is that you integrated BTCPay so well into your system.
As a contributor to BTCPay, I don't often get a chance to get great feedback like this, so I hope you don't mind me asking:
- What was the best/worst thing about BTCPay?
- What pissed you off the most?
- What can be improved that would make your experience better?
I wanted to ask if you use LN (people at this stage really tend to spend BTC via LN, at least to experiment, LN is now the major payment method in our store) but looking at the transaction values you mentioned, it's probably not a good idea.
Can't help you much with marketing, but if you want, I can add you to [the list of BTCPay merchants]( also there are a few good resources that help Bitcoin businesses market, like directories, etc.
About the legal things, can't say for EU, but there's a very interesting fiat bridge coming in BTCPay very soon, that will allow merchants to connect to their local exchanges to convert to fiat instantly (a portion or a whole amount), which may help with accounting and "legal crap". It will be really decentralized in a sense that merchant will select the exchange and connect it to BTCPay. But the bridge itself can be used for plenty of other things. It'll be interesting.

Hey u/TheGreatMuffin
Please share the links to the stores once you set them up. I'd like to keep my [BTCPay Guide and merchant list](  to date.
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:53:48
Bitcoin-Yoda gave some important guidelines, and trust me even though it may sound harsh it is the truth and he has the point. 
I see that your major concern is the cost. Well, I can tell you that they are working on finding a workaround. Also Microsoft Azure gives you 200$ so you can use it to cover the cost of at least 2-3 months. 
There is also a solution where you can connect to another stores' server if they have it opened. We have that opened in our store, so you can get payments to your wallet and it will be processed through that node. 
If you're really interested in BTCPay, join merchants, devs, and enthusiasts on Slack, I assure you it's becoming very big deal and that more and more people looking to spend BTC prefer privacy and would rather pay through BTCPay than any other third-party processor.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I know how it feels and how confusing it is when you start, that's why I'd like to help you.
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:00:03
Besides those mentioned, [Noded]( sounds promising.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:14:19


Good point I agree with this. While I don't agree with some of their decisions it's still an exciting project with really healty community.
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:14:28
If you take a look at [librepatron]( which is Patreon alternative using BTCPay, the developer handles re-occurring payments like this:


There's an on-going discussion our BTCPay Slack as I type this to use something similar in the Crowdfund app. The developer of the app said he'll implement a similar system next week.
The ideal subscription payments in Lightning would probably have to be solved with a new proposal or within the wallets themselves.
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:53:48
Librepatron is in alpha, as the page says, go to their slack or github and provide feedback. UX has ways to go is not helpful at all.
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:54:26
Congratulations! Adam
A few users requested Liquid in BTCPay. We even had a [discussion on Twitter]( which showed people don't understand it quite yet.
Could you maybe quickly comment on potential use-cases for BTCPay users or merchants in general?
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:16:30
Just to clarify, this is not poster shilling. This poster was designed for CoinJournal which is the media partner for an awesome crypto event taking place in the UK, Manchester on the April 5th,6th,7th 2018. 
Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the organizers, but my store gave away few items for their raffles.
I am amazed at the amount of passion these guys invest in this event, which is by the way free to attend, so how not to help them? 
Check it out the event you're in the UK.

Not really sure about the native integration, I'll ping Sam, lead dev, perhaps he can give better info on XMR integration on OB u/CC_EF_JTF
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:49:42
More stories like this, please! This guy might be the Pineapple Fund guy, you never know... :)
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:51:45
Yes, I'm running a multiple product shop and Woocommerce (ecom platform I'm using) and BTCPay are doing all the heavy lifting.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:22:12
Exactly my point.
I'd encourage everyone to TRY OB. 
Do not judge the platform based on what people say or based on toxic fights.
I do not agree with the view of some of their devs but they are not forcing me to do anything. I can still accept bitcoin, I still only accept bitcoin.  The view of one or two devs is not the view of the projects itself. They are trying to spread the adoption, you can't blame them for trying to get more people to use their platform. More people &gt; More feedback &gt; better OB. 
Plus trust me, these guys are working very hard on the OB, I've been following their slack for a while now.
They day I am forced to accept certain coin is the day I will stop using OB. Until I have the freedom, I'll continue to use it.
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:20:00
Corrected, ty.
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:07:57
BTCPay is open-source and customizable if you want to become a custodial service and offer multi-sigs, escrow where a bunch of unknown people would transact you can do that, you can develop something like that inside, now by thinking about it, I'm quite certain it wouldn't take much effort either, by looking at features we already have.
For example, right now with BTCPay you can already allow people to register and use your server. Each of them would be receiving payments to their wallet but through your full node. [Read this for example]( That's the beauty of BTCPay imo, you can tear it apart and develop whatever fits your particular use-case.
No refunds is what you do when buying things with Bitcoin anyway, you're trusting the merchant and his reputation in most cases.
The core of the software is to be universal and free people from third-parties, bring back freedom... But you can customize it and use it in unimaginable ways.
We just had people in the community asking for an easy way to raise money as developers, content-creators, etc and we build it. But you can always expand. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 07:15:56

Thanks for the feedback. It really means a lot. 
Great suggestion, I'll have to take a look into that. I'm not sure but the CMS I am using currently has only flat currencies. But I am sure there' a way to have a BTC price, I'll have to find it, you already gave me a good direction for it.
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:28:03
That sounds awesome and a bit worrying, but I'd love to see it if you can post an image, yup, I'm obsessed.

Good news. We used CoinGate before switching to BTCPay. My experience is they are a good group of people.

@_date: 2017-09-20 09:08:08
Great, thank you for support and feedback. I'll continue to improve the designs and add more minimalist and niche stuff. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:04:16
Interesting perspective, thanks for sharing.
Payment processors help people with high enough transaction volume to automate things. A merchant with only 2-3 Bitcoin transactions per week can use just simple address and do it all via email, but once the volume grows, payment processors automate things to an incredible extent.
Also, there are [free BTCPay hosts]( so for small merchants that can't justify 3-5$/month, they do the job even though trusting a third party is not ideal, but it's free.
About integrating BTCPay with your accounting system, care to share a little bit what you did? BTCPay has invoice CSV export and from recently a QuickBooks plugin so it's quite easy to load necessary data to your accountant. Really curious about that one.
Great post and feedback, I completely agree, it depends on your customers.
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:29:10
Amazing idea. My store,  accepts bitcoin, you can add it if you want.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:06:09


Once you understand what Bitcoin is how it works and why it exist, you'll understand how dumb this statement is. 
For starters  
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:12:34
You slightly misunderstood what BTCPay is.
BTCPay is a self-hosted payment processor. You host it yourself. You're your own bank.
The easiest way to deploy BTCPay is 1-click web deployment  (by the way you can host BTCPay on anything you imagine, there are tons of guides in the documentation, but this is the most newbie-friendly).
If you don't want to self-host BTCPay, there are people who allow others to create an account on their server (by the way anyone can become so-called "host for others" only thing needed it to enable registration for others). Here's a list of third-party hosts. But please read the docs on pros and cons of hosting with a third party 
So BTCPay does not provide any "service". We give you tools that you can use for particular use-case.

It's not in the next release, LN is already on BTCPay for a week or so.  We've been testing it in our store, however, c-lightning implementation still needs to be updated by the Blockstream devs.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:58:52
Well of course this has been asked before. Where did you buy them? If you're newbie you can use an exchange you're comfortable with. Localbitcoins is great place, and if you want to sell it in an decentralized exchange, give Bisq a try.

@_date: 2018-02-19 09:26:05

Hi, they are habdled through Coingate 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:41:35

@_date: 2018-03-04 23:40:43
Yes, but with Azure there is one click deployment, if you have technical knowledge, I don't see why not.

I still haven't decided on other crypto's, sorry about that. For now I'm focused on Bitcoin only, but perhaps in future I can expand the offer.  It's not that it's hard to add it, but I just want to have more focused offer, at least in the early days.
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:47:00


You are probably the first store to use BTCPay, wish I discovered it earlier :) Congratulations!
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:44:53
The way BTCPay works as an open-source project is - you need it you either implement it or at least request it :-) 
There are no roadmaps and everything, for now, goes quite organically.
Could you open an issue requesting this? I think that way a dev who finds it interesting may implement it.
I think one way in which BTCPay can improve is - integrations, so if there are devs here wanting to help out, feel free to come to our Slack.

I remember trying to get bitmerch.com and it was taken, I completely forgot about [BitMerch]( completely.
It was quite hard to find .com domains, I assume re-sellers got to them first, so I went with this generic bitcoinshirt.co I admit it wasn't much creative approach.
Thanks for the feedback. May I ask your opinion on the products themselves? I don't mind criticism, I can take it.

Good idea about the sky. I actually have a tiny site which sells these designs of mine, but don't want to share the link, as I really do not want this to be a self promotion post. Just want to see if the community likes what I made. 
Okay, brace yourself ( it's a copy paste from my website, didn't actually type all of this )
The story
All of us in the crypto community are on a rollercoaster. We should be thankful for being a part of a disruptive technology which will change the world we live in. The journey we are all part of is not always easy. It has ups and downs. Even though we don’t know if tomorrow we will have ups or downs, one thing is sure, this ride is going to the Moon, sooner or later.
With this illustration, we wanted to represent the diversity of a Bitcoin and pretty much any other blockchain and crypto currency community. We are different. We invest with different beliefs and goals. And all of that is fine. As long as we are together.
The Bitcoin roller-coaster illustration is based on a famous Bitcoin rollercoaster gif. While we love this gif, we wanted to create our own version of the Bitcoin community and add as many different characters as we could. On the rollercoaster ride which is heading to the moon you can see different members of the community.
In the front seat, we have the programmers who were the part of the cypherpunk movement. The early adopters. People without whom none of us would be here. This honors all the contributors of the Bitcoin community.
Behind them is an investor. Either greedy one or just an angel investor who had a strong belief that this is all possible.
The baby Bitcoin represent all the newbies who are eagerly learning and asking questions, making the community live and active.
The Liberator represents the community members who believe in decentralization and the better world. It was hard to find a stereotype for them, so we represented them with a famous Anonymous mask, riding with both hands in the air, representing free-spirit and freedom.
Criminal Bitcoin – like it or not, one of the earliest adopters of crypto currencies were people using it for illegal activities.
Panic seller – the last but not the least is the panic seller, representing all of those guys who do not HODL. They quickly get rid of their BTC as soon as the price goes down. We represented them with a scared facial expression, holding a calculator, waiting to jump out of the roller-coaster as soon as their calculations are good.

It's a risky business. Luckily managed to persuade one supplier to take BTC, so it's easier when we don't need to convert to fiat.
If you're referring to specific actions here's how  I do it. I have a "fiat part". This is the "safe part" It's used to pay suppliers who don't accept crypto and in case of a refund, to refund the buyer who paid with fiat. I never keep it lower than the estimated amount. It's our safe zone.
The other part is bitcoin. I try to keep it in the economy. It's never converted right away. I tiny on it and use it to pay with it whenever I can (VPN, openbazaar, web designer, the crypto supplier). Whenever my fiat safe zone goes below the "safe amount" I sell the portion of bitcoin to keep mitigate the risk.  From recently, I'm using Bisq for selling.
We are also giving away a portion of our crypto profits to charities and crypto projects.
The store is very small with only a few orders per week, so we quickly adapt. I admire the larger companies.
When there are massive ups and downs, people rarely pay in bitcoin. So far my experience is that the stable periods are the best for our business.

I was not aware they were pro SegWit2x to be honest, I haven't seen them announcing it, but I'll make sure to ask the developers on Slack. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:22:26
If you are a Redditor who owns an online business accepting crypto, leave a comment, a link to your store, your physical store location, your OpenBaazar ID, anything. 
Edit : Perhaps we can have a list of Redditors who own a business and we can post it tomorrow or something (just an idea)
Edit 2 : Anoher way to find Redditor accepting bitcoin is through the search, try something like this

I asked the developers on Slack about this and got the reply.


This is not an official announcement or anything, just a view of one of the developers. I am in no way affiliated to OB, I am just a seller and a user of the platform.

We call it the crowdfund, but it can be used for donations and even voting. Users can vote for features or support their favorite dev or content creator. It's quite customizable, there are few demo examples in that article.
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:24:03
Thanks, watching it right now, somehow I missed that video.
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:22:41
Thanks for this insightful comment. I'll save it.
The problem with Cryptoowoo is that it requires a GMP extension and PHP 5.6, most of the sharing plans do not support GMP anyway, it's always a cloud or a dedicated. 
I have PHP 7.0 on my shared, but for cloud options, they offer GMP on 5.4. Which was a deal-breaker, since it appears I can only use a dedicated server in order to run it.
After doing some research I was really happy to discover 
They indeed take 1% fee, but there are no withdrawal fees or monthly fees.
Do you have any similar suggestions like Coingate?
My problem is also that I have to pay my suppliers in the USD, so when withdrawing BTC to my Trezor, I will probably need a debit card solution to pay my supplier directly.
Coingate WAS a perfect match since they have 1% transaction fee and from what I read, no fee on withdrawals on SEPA in EUR which was PERFECT for me, but after further reading in order to withdraw anything but BTC, you need to be a business and have a business address.

Someone suggested that I should try to manually deactivate an entire account and that in theory, they will refund. I'll try to do that. If not, I'll charge back. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:41:35
They just need more people to test it and use it, provide feedback, etc. I'm hoping to really make an offer on Openbazaar different with these designs of mine. Can't wait for the 2.0 honestly.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:40:59
I'm trying to keep a track of merchants who publicly shared they process their payments through BTCPay. It's getting harder and harder to track, please if someone is aware of other stores ping me.
From the guide I recently published on Reddit :
Note: If you're a merchant accepting BTCPay and would like to be listed here, just comment. The list is in alphabetical order.
* [9bravos.com](
* [bitcoinshirt.co](
* [Coincards.ca](
* [CryptoAsylum.com](
* [halongmining.com](
* [ludvigart.com](
* [ynotek.com](
I agree, there sould be a more convinient way of keeping a track. 
EDIT : Added 2 more, keep pinging people.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:36:06
Was it from my store? If so, please get in touch via PM, we'll sort it out. Though we only recently launched sweatshirts, literally a few days ago.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:25:31
One of the reasons is that it's written by someone who's livining and breathing crypto, not by someone who just researched the subject. He has a blog, check it out. Also whenever I was "okay that makes sense, but he forgot..." I realized he did not forget to explain it. It was 25$ if I remember well, thought it was pricey, but then realized why, it's really well-written. The only thing I did not like is that o his website he sells it through Gumroad platorm, so no Bitcoin payments, was quite weird not being able to pay in btc for it.

Sorry, didn't mean to sound mean, but this is true. For my taste most of the store designs were bad with no story. I never came across your store. I like things you're doing. Keep it up and good luck.

That makes sense, I'll try to create one T-shirt tomorrow.

Finally, people are starting to wake up. It's good that Peter and others are pointing out to the errors in the crypto space. I posted last week [a guide to accepting BTCPay]( on Reddit and it got a little traction, we managed to get 2-3 new merchants to embrace BTCPay.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:56:27
This was actually made for my store  so I do sell them. But I like how this one particularly looked, so thought to give it away to great community here.

Thanks for the feedback. I'm a cartoonist, so that's why I went with this design. There are already tons of stuff out there, and I wanted to have something different what tells a story.  I understand this kind of design might not be appealing to everyone (well apparently majority) and I will try to think of something different and clean as well. If you have any further suggestions, I'd love to hear them. Thanks once again.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:08:26
If I am not mistaken the search engine works only for OB1, not the 2.0 version, but the most sellers are switching to 2.0 so it's probably the best to download a desktop app and play with it. In my opinion OB 2.0 is way better and way more user-friendly to 1.0

I wanted to support people behind crypto projects, but things like this are also a good idea, thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:59:23
It's a valid argument. I am thinking of removing the domain name from designs, at the time of creating these I thought that bitcoin.org is Core's website. Thanks for the suggestion. Bitcoin.org was the website which helped me learn a lot about BTC, so I thought to give a little "PR" as you call it. I'm not affiliated with them if that's what you're referring to. But a portion of profits goes to organizations like this. I am thinking of donating to Luke JR this month, due to the damages his house suffered in the Irma hurricane.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:51:47

As a way of changing the world.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:10:40
Hm, the title is a bit misleading. 
As someone who's been using OB for 5-6 months now, I still do not understand the number of shit community gives to their team.
Of course, I as a seller do not agree with their altcoin change, but we have to understand that :
1. BTC is still a default wallet in OB. Sellers do not have to choose their store to accept cash or other shit coins.
2. OB needs buyers and people to spend their coins. I can confirm that Bitcoin holders do not like spending their coins, so I am sure they based their decision on that.
But seriously, I encourage you to download the platform and try it out. It has its problems, but it's getting better. My view is that they should not waste time on altcoins, but we can't blame them for trying to get more buyers and usability on their platform. Once again, nobody is forced to use any of those shitcoins and Bitcoin is the default wallet. As a seller, I was really pissed off when they announced cash, but I realized I just have an OPTION. I am not required to accept it and I won't accept it.

There have been questions about other color options, I have them in my store, but they are all separate listings :
* [White Version](
* [Black Minimalist version -white logos ](
* [White Minimalist version -black logos](
I'd like to thank everyone for the support, I'm humbled by the support and even got few orders, two paid with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:00:23
I still haven't decided on other crypto's, sorry about that. For now I'm focused on Bitcoin only, but perhaps in future I can expand the offer.  It's not that it's hard to add it, but I just want to have more focused offer, at least in the early days.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:25:16
Thanks man��
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:02:59
Well, payment is held with moderator until the order is received, I am not quite sure how it works, to be honest, still have to research it. There are moderators which I as a seller select and then they are like an escrow. It's far from perfect, but I assume it's the best for a decentralized system like this. Moderators usually take small fee 1-2%, but I haven't set any moderators for my store yet, the transaction can be direct as well. I hope this helps.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:38:56
You'd be surprised, but there are few more merchants there. I'm not sure if they are all running a live store, but I assume some are.
 Was really happy to see the community where merchants and in some case competitors help each other out just to spread the adoption.

I just found this article perhaps it'll be helpful for getting you started 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:31:15
That's probably the dumbest complaint I've ever heard. 
The reason the prices are in the USD is due to BTC volatility. Don't tell me you would have never looked up how much are you actually paying for a T-Shirt.
If your complaint is regarding Bitcoin conversion in Fiat, we do not do that, we actually receive BTC on our end.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:05:39

Congratulations to winners and better luck next time to all the participants. Would you like me to organize more giveaways like this?
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:58:58
If you have a dedicated server Cryptowoo looks great, but won't work (to my knowledge) with 90% of shared hostings out there which do not support a thing called GMP extension and at least PHP 5.6 which for me was a bummer.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:38:45
Why Squarespace if you don't mind?
I have a [WordPress store](  accepting bitcoin, we also had troubles finding a perfect solution, but eventually found it through guys at CoinGate.
Anyhow, good to know you find a way to manage payments, such dedication is always good, even though it may get cumbersome for you at one point. 
Good luck with your business, I know how hard it can be, but it's always good waking up knowing your business makes crypto grow even as an ultra tiny part of the ecosystem.

For now it's 3% of profits split between bitcoin.org and OpenBaazar, you can read about it here 
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:09:59
This will cut the cost for us in the long run, when we have more sales, so the decision is not based on the costs, as at this moment it would be cheaper to stay with a third party, but I'd like to use the BTC the way it's supposed to be used, I know my customers would appreciate the decision, so it's a win-win.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:15:48
Because I believe in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:03:41
Good point, will correct it.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:59:07
Honestly, right now it's small and in development, but the potential is huge. If you jump in early you can become a reputable seller later when the market grows, which I'm sure will happen. 2.0 is still in beta version, they should release the full version soon.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:22:30
Wow, thanks so much :)
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:28:48
Woocommerce is greatly but it requires some work to make it work with Bitcoin. I accept both PayPal and bitcoin. There are bunch of extension out there to accept Bitcoin, and I found Coingate to be the most suitable thought it takes 1% fee. There is extension called Cryptowoo but it requires a powerful hosting which at the moment is not cost effective. Just start slowly, there are tons of free resources to learn.

Basically, I wanted to represent all of the BTC enemies as a bank, an evil bank. If you take a closer look at the illustration you will notice plenty of hidden stuff. First of all, the Bank has dropped its weapons, it looks weak, though it can still fight back. The shield which the bank character holds is slowly cracking. Our Bitcoin Knight holds a powerful sword, which should resemble the Bitcoin price chart. The war is not over. We will win sooner or later. To the Moon!
Oh yes, NO2X had to be added.

Hey, thanks everyone for participating, the winners have been announced here 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:24:49
I do, but as I said, we don't determine the price of the international shipping. Have you thought about choosing the cheaper method? Pillows and mugs are something we're looking into sorting, as shipping for those is always a bit more.  We have some items in EU fulfillment center for our EU customers, that's why I asked where are you based.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:49:37
imho this is what spreads the adoption. But for people who earn bitcoin, there's sometimes no other option. I'm happy to say I managed to persuade few people including my web dev to accept it, just by asking, "hey can I pay you in BTC".
If you ever need to buy some gifts or some bitcoin merch, I accept Bitcoin in [my store](
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:59:06


Bitcoin ≠ Bitcoin traders. Bitcoin  ≠ all of us, believers. I think your topic is incredibly dumb, sorry. You're refering to it as a drug. If a groundbreaking technology is a drug to you, gimme more of that Sir! It would be much better if journalists like yourself would spent time learning about Bitcoin and why it matters instead of writing crappy articles. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:48:24
Sorry, didn't mean to sound mean, but this is true. For my taste most of the store designs were bad with no story. I never came across your store. I like things you're doing. Keep it up and good luck.
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:44:55
Good job OP.
If anyone prefers crypto payments and a bit different design, check out my work 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:26:47
Heather colors contain 10% polyester, but regular colors are 100% ring spun cotton :-)
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:48:45
I do, even the IRC, but the video would become a daily routine instead of the morning one ☕
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:26:48
You're not the first one requesting this, so I am seriously considering at least adding an option or a variation for users to choose designs with or without the domain. I still haven't set it up, but if you want it no domain, send me a PM and I'll make a design for you without the web address. Really appreciate the suggestion. I'm thinking of having only "bitcoin" as a sign as well.
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:54:40
That's not true. 
Our payments through CoinGate are received in Bitcoins and are withdrawn to our Trezor each week. I'd recommend you to check out CoinGate.
We tried to use CryptoWoo to accept payments directly, but that, however, is not possible with the current hosting we have.
It's necessary to go to a third party for now, but your claim that we do not accept bitcoins simple makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:46:30
Thank you. Obviously people have different taste. I will try to have more clean stuff added. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:04:20
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll fix that as soon as I'm on my desktop.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:38:24
I am really happy that you like the design. Some people may find cartoons childish and prefer the aggressive meme stuff. I just want to have a design which will be educational in a way and also make people wonder what is it that you're wearing and once you begin to explain the story behind it they might fall in love with BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:29:47
Thanks for being honest. In that case, I will put a link to my openbaazar store and have OB logo in the footer to promote the project.
Once I open the store, I'll most certainly post the feedback. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:36:26
No worries, you deserved it for the typing at least. I am so glad that it's obvious for people in community to notice who is who :)
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:53:04
I love Nordic design.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:09:54
Most of these are Unisex. My girlfriend and I tried out the same size, check it out here  , if she knows how to wear it, it can look good even if it's bigger. Indeed I plan to add more ladies shirts, not just the unisex ones we have already. Good suggestion, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:58:17
You should post this on Bitcointalk, as entries will be there.

Hey, u/tellman1257 I'm the owner of the Bitcoin merchandise store  and we accept Bitcoin and few other altcoins. If you can, please add it to the list.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:10:27
Thanks for the feedback, some members here earlier told me to go with the simple design, so I made this quite simple. Embroidery is hard to be complicated. It's hard to make a sensible design on such small space and with the machines, I am working with. 
I indeed have some cartoon-like designs, like this one for shirts   is this what you prefer? Just looking to gather as much feedback as possible I appreciate your comment.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:01:34
Hey, I don't mind even if you open one, it's a free market out there :) I used Wordpress as a Content Managment System (CMS) combined with an addition called Woocommerce for a website itself. Hope this helps. We need more BTC stores, so if you need any help, feel free to let me know. To The Moon!
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:21:04
I hope you don't mind me not wanting to share the stuff I made until I am done completely, I promise, I'll post it here in few weeks. It's crypto related.
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:44:58
Haha, good one! :)
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:10:21
They are available on OpenBazaar (store ID QmRCbNSaYb5LU4DXQWZ65AQr1G9EzUsedTiWceVdVtBJa6 or on my site 
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:42:34
I am sure someone can clarify this better than I can, but for instance, my first order was indeed a P.O box. So a customer used P.O I guess it can be a good idea. I personally do not care for it as you said since I use a business address for returns. 
For privacy, they allow the usage through TOR, though this has nothing to do with your question.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:28:16
Superb list! Saving this.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:04:02
Believer or not you're late to the party since we closed the competition yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:11:00
Our suppliers do not accept Bitcoin. I'm sure you can't understand what a struggle and a risk that can be.
It's up to us to offer options for people to pay. 50% of our customer orders so far were paid with PayPal. 
The ecosystem still needs to rely on fiat, unfortunately. It will change, but it takes time I guess. 
Our payments through the third party take us 1% fee, trust me if there was a way which integrates with current software we use, I'd gladly take it, but there's none at the moment. I mentioned CryptoWoo earlier, but it requires us to move to a VPS, which is not cost-effective yet, as soon as it becomes I'll be switching right away.
The claim that I am an opportunist cashing in on a fad is disgraceful and you should be ashamed. I just don't understand people like you. 
Thanks for your feedback, while I understand some of your points, I think you're being to harsh and a bit unfair.
To conclude, if you prefer direct crypto payments with no third party checkout (I personally don't see anything wrong with that), we have a store on OpenBaazar (ID QmRCbNSaYb5LU4DXQWZ65AQr1G9EzUsedTiWceVdVtBJa6) , so that solves it.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:02:03
True adoption, good work!
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:44:27
Thanks for the feedback. I'm a cartoonist, so that's why I went with this design. There are already tons of stuff out there, and I wanted to have something different what tells a story.  I understand this kind of design might not be appealing to everyone (well apparently majority) and I will try to think of something different and clean as well. If you have any further suggestions, I'd love to hear them. Thanks once again.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:08:44
Small business owner accepting Bitcoin here. My site is 
I spent few weeks researching this topic. Here are two very best things I found.
First, It depends on the technology your site/app is build with. We use CoinGate. They don't convert our bitcoins, but allow us the option to do it if necessary, which is great. They don't charge us withdrawal fees. You can sell your Bitcoins with them. Basically it's the system we found the best for our type of business. We can get our payments to our hardware wallet and sell them with the exchange we like if necessary, this takes time, but small businesses like ours are flexible and can adapt to this. I assume it's harder for a larger business.
There is a plugin called cryptowoo which allows you to accept Bitcoin directly to your HD wallet, but it requires very complex server, which in our case was not cost effective.
You can use other third party integrations like Stripe, Bitpay (please don't) and others. But if you truly believe in Bitcoin, and you want to hodl it, use it to pay with it, just use an integration which won't convert your Bitcoin right away.
We accept Bitcoin because we believe in it. We convert it to fiat only when we need to pay our suppliers. It's hard, it's risky but I wake up every day, proud to be the part of this ecosystem and I'm doing my tiny tiny roll in changing the world.
If you want to read my first month of accepting Bitcoin you can read it here 
Hope you'll change your perspective of converting to fiat right away, because true supporters will do their best HODL it, and convert only when absolutely needed.

Why would you listen to whatever people say? It's a free platform, give it a try. I'm sure you'll find it exciting.
It has its problems, but with each release, it's improving. Been on OB for 6 months now. From time to time it's frustrating, slow and has bugs, but it's also exciting and decentralized.

Thanks for the input. When I first started out learning about Bitcoin, that website helped me a lot. My idea is to help newbies who might get interested btc, give them a direction of some sort. But I can probably make a version without the URL.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:01:22
The book in question is called "The Age of Cryptocurrency".
I also managed to find some info on who was the first one to suggest it (apparently it's the SmokesTooMuch user on Bitcointalk forums). [source](


What is more interesting is that Satoshi himself was against it, at least postponing it as much as possible


But I was unable to find if the  [Laszlo Hanyecz]( was the first one to use it.

Hi guys,
Here's another giveaway.
**The rules are simple** :
Just leave a comment and I'll choose 1 random winner.
To make everything transparent, like in my previous giveaways, I will make a video. Winner will be chosen completely randomly via random.org 
Write whatever you want in the comments.
I will send this worldwide, but if any custom office fees happen, you'll have to take care of that. By submitting a comment, you agree with the rules.
If by any chance you're interested in snapback specs, you can [check them out on my store](
If you want to make sure this is not a fake giveaway, check out previous giveaways I did on reddit ( [giveaway 1]( [giveaway 2]( [giveaway 3]) and some of the winners even posted a photo of the prize ( [Reddit proof]( | [BitcoinTalk proof](

Sure thing, I accept btc.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:39:49
It's basically a software, a wallet which helps sync transaction all over the network, you can download it from the bitcoin core website, and from what I know it helps the system. I hope more advanced user can give a bit more technical explanation if that's what you're requesting.
Edit: This helped me understand a Full Node better 
From what I know Trezor is okay to keep the BTC in, I have my there as well.
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:08:15
I still have a few typos and grammar errors to iron out. I'm still adding info, but published it and will improve it based on the feedback. It's quite detailed, so you can use the sidebar reading progress bar to jump to the sections that interest you the most.
Feel free to let me know if you spot anything that needs fixing or you have a question/suggestion.

For starters, run a 0.15.0  full node and keep your BTC on reliable  hardware wallet or paper wallet. 
Email companies supportive of 2X and tell them that they suck ( or even better tell them you're no longer use their service if they support the attack on Bitcoin).
Just spread the word and help other newbies.
I believe that's all we as newbies and users can do.
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:27:47
Will do, I just need to figure out the differences between different versions and decide which one to grab.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:58:37


Thank you, I really appreciate that.
It was a funny experience and I certainly regret for not getting into cryptocurrency earlier, but I guess what matters is that I'm all in now and that it's something that motivates me to learn and explore.

I know this is not exactly what you had in mind, but it has a rollercoaster :-) 
Each of these characters represents a type of Bitcoin community users. If you're really curious I can write what each of these represents.
The heat sensitive mug is amazing idea, I am not quite sure how the manufacturers of these can be found.

Me too, was looking forward to this but can't find it nor in stream one or after lunch stream :(
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:20:33
Great list. Been using CoinGate, true Bitcoin believers, good supoort and easy to set up. 
For site owners who'd like to hodl like myself you can get Bitcoin, for those who prefer fiat, they allow you to sell/buy through them, great for newbies. I'll probably move to BTCpay, since I'd like to further improve the privacy of my customers, but it's a bit harder to set up. Blockonimics appears to be good as well, though at the time I opened my store they were fairly unknown. Anyway, if anyone would like yo check how coingate looks and works, take a look at their demo site or my store 
This was great article by the way.

Great suggestion, I'll have to take a look into that. I'm not sure but the CMS I am using currently has only flat currencies. But I am sure there' a way to have a BTC price, I'll have to find it, you already gave me a good direction for it.

There's no "the best" since each tries to fill a different gap in the market. I recommend that you do own research and try to understand your needs and try to fit that into a budget.
We've reviewed popular HW wallets here  so you can use those as a resource in learning. 
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:49:39
It should probably be "sticky" like yesterday.

@_date: 2018-07-25 09:12:57
tl;dr : u/NicolasDorier wants to create an integration to a hosting/domain services which accept Bitcoin, so that merchants can pay for their server hosting with BTC.
This will not only lower the entry barrier and maintenance costs but also spread the adoption and support companies who accept Bitcoin.
If you own such business or know a reputable business which we can use to integrate with BTCPay, please let us know.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:56:28
Haha, thanks man!
I do, worldwide shipping.
As for the cost, I made a live rate shipping calculator which will offer you live rates, lowest possible ones, just add whatever you wish to cart and check it out, it was way better than having a flat rate.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:54:34

Merchants need an organized payment processing system. BTCPay lets us receive payments to our hardware wallet while creating the address for each invoice, keeping the track of the confirmations and automatically updates the payment status so that we can ship the item. It runs on our own full node and there are no intermediades, it's open-soure, free and protects the privacy of our customers.  Oh, and did I mention it has LN support? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:10:58
Thank you :)

What are your thoughts on Bitpay Fork - BTC Pay?
@_date: 2018-07-01 16:59:33
Quite sophisticated attack considering they were not able to identify the attack vector yet.
One more proof why we need a stand-alone software or the compatibility with the Core wallet and not web-wallets.

It does not, but it's something devs are working on. [The Merchant's guide]( mentions this though.

This is huge! The main problem for us as a merchant using c-lightning through BTCPaywas the UI and the inability to track the balance and channels with ease. Let's hope the two can work together.
Edit: Confirmed, u/NicolasDorier never sleeps, just seen his comment about BTCPay and Fulmo.

A while ago I had a bunch of hardware wallets sitting on my desk, so I decided to write about them in an easy to understand way with no distractions. I created a website called the Bitcoinwalletguy. However it was getting harder and harder to balance between that blog and the store I run, so I decided to merge them.
Upcoming reviews :
* Trezor T
* ColdCard 
* Secalot 
* Ecomi wallet (discovered this one today)
If you guys know any other wallet that would be interesting to review, let me know.
I still have to update my Ledger review (they now have new built-in software wallet) and probably DigitalBitbox (they're launching their 2.0 software from what I've heard soon).

I am particularly interested in how latest LND 0.41 will work with c-lightning. In past there were some hiccups. I highly recommend that you first use the test item if you ever plan to go crazy and pay for a higher-valued invoice.
If you paid for a test item, post an invoice and I'll pay it back. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 23:07:46
For starters you are the bank, no intermediates,  improved privacy, P2P, no fees.

@_date: 2018-07-02 09:12:41
u/johnturtle - this is cool!
Once the payment is made, shouldn't the checkout pop-up close or provide notification it's been processed? I believe I've sent multiple payments from my node without even knowing if it succeeded or not, until I refreshed the homepage of yours.
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:39:23
I'll try to do that, have to find their URI.
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:30:40
Yeah, I originally thought his questions was about the local hosting, which I know u/LudvigBitcoinArt mentioned. But yeah, the BTCPay is running on Linux. Don't confuse Microsoft azure server hosting with windows.

It's added now! Hooray!
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:13:08
Best of luck man, great story!
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:36:21
That's correct! What is great with BTCPay is that they allow for merchants to help others receive payments through their node. We have our page opened so that other woomerchants can give it a try, though it's the best for them to run their own node. Good news is that there are people in BTCPay community working on Shopify integration, but it's harder due to closed nature of Shopify opposed to open Woo.
@_date: 2018-07-13 20:11:47
Awesome news, just found the original [post on their blog]( 
Added them right away to the [list of merchants using BTCPay](
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:20:30
I know devs behind the OpenNode are true Bitcoiners and good guys, I've even helped them test their early Woocommerce plugin in my store when it was in beta and they helped me understand the LN much better.
However, it's unfair to claim that they are the first payment processor when BTCPay has had the LN support for 2-3 months already.
OpenNode is the first LN to fiat processor, and maybe the first processor to use the LND implementation of the Lightning Network, BTCPay uses c-lightning and should soon support LND as well.
If I am not mistaken so far these are the Lighting Network processors :
* BTCPay
* OpenNode
* CoinGate
* Strike Acinq
* Globee
EDIT: I've just realized there's one more payment processor, thanks u/bitusher 
EDIT2: There's one more, 5 in total!
I was lucky to use all 3! We ended up choosing the BTCPay, but in essence, they are all great in their own way.
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:25:54

Hey someone earlier reported successful eclair wallet transaction. I've not tested eclair yet, but if it has logs it would be helpful to further troubleshoot it. I'm just guessing but it's possible it can't find a route, in that case you can try and open a direct channel (this is just a guess as I'm not familiar with Eclair yet).
If someone familiar with Eclair can chime in and provide information about the error that would be great.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:37:02
Good news, thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:01:10
Neat, I tried to donate over LN, but you only have the QR code, it would be handy to have actual copy/paste invoice.
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:10:49
For LN, you have to be the server admin as far as I know. For on-chain transactions, you can connect to any of the free hosts, the btcpay main2 site, or even normal stores, like ours, we have our server open so that others can connect.

It's actually quite easy and since smaller merchants want to save money, they always prefer figuring it out themselves. The community on slack is always there to help. There are docs and step by step video tutorials. I was not technical, yet after 3 hours I was able to have it up and running. I'm sure there are people who can do it for a fee. There are some guys who host their own BTCPay servers and allow others to connect to them, it requires few minutes to connect your store. We're not in that business but we have our server open for other smaller merchants to connect for free.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:47:34

Yeah, that's why I'm mostly interested in seeing if people with 0.4.1 can checkout. I remember there were some issues with 0.4.0 but it worked in some cases. The issue I was getting the most, is [this one]( which Andreas ] opened on GitHub. C-lightning to c-lighting worked in most cases.
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:27:23
Yup, this is a list of stores using BTCPay as a payment processor, it does not mean that the store running BTCPay uses LN. I love your site and list by the way.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:25:50
Care to share order id, I'd like to take a look at it on my end just to make sure they are getting through. Are you on 0.4.1 LND?
You can pm me.

EDIT: never-mind, I think I figured it out, I'm certainly seeing it on my end now. Perfect!

So here's what happened.
1. A third-party company on behalf of some YouTuber selling shitty courses reached out to Reddit, sent DMCA.
2. Reddit, without any fact-checking, removed the post.
3. Bashco and Belcher (admins) helped us reach out to Reddit and try to explain how stupid this whole situation is.
4. The only way for us to find out who submitted a DMCA, (Reddit didn't want to tell us) is to issue a legal request to Reddit, which one of our community members did.
5. We submitted counter DMCA, and the user has 10 days to reply otherwise, Reddit brings the post back online, but this means we've entered the legal process with the scammer.
6. 10 business days deadline expired yesterday, still waiting to hear back from Reddit.
The whole situation is comic, but we must learn to fight back these bullies.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:54:32
I hate to say it but your constant nagging and in a way aggressiveness s towards our store when we started made me re-think and adapt so that we really do run like a Bitcoin store.
In a way, it's because of your constant "Fuck you and your store" did I try to find a best strategy that may satisfy true Bitcoiners. On another hand that lead me to discover BTCPay, so I'm now more involved into helping others understand BTCPay better and use it, than maintaining our small store :)
@_date: 2018-12-31 10:08:59


Read this 
1. Address re-use is a terrible privacy practice
2. How would you know who paid you? I'd have to let you know I paid? Put yourself in the shoes of someone receiving hundreds of payments. How do you manage all that chaos? 
BTCPay automates things, provide a different address for each invoice.
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:41:28
Yup, you can do it right out of the box via the checkout page. Just select the coin from the drop-down. But since you like LN, take a look at [BTCPay and Joule integration]( it's seriously cool. It's off-topic, but I really love it so sharing it.
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:26:52
Quite easy to implement as well, for any existing news site or blog.
For starters, it would be nice if crypto news sites started using this instead of spamming the sub asking for clicks, they'd have to write a hell of good content.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:19:44
Yes this is a re-post, but before you downvote it, let me explain why I'm posting this again:
* Article is updated. It's now easier to deploy BTCPay server (1 minute compared to 20 min than before)
* BTCPay now has a plugin in official WP repo so it's much easier to connect to WordPress
* I've noticed an increased amount of posts about merchants wanting to accept Bitcoin lately, so I decided to clean things up.
* During the holidays, people usually want to start a new business and have new ideas, so thought to share this
Now, besides this article, I've recorded over 18 videos. Videos are also translated into French. 
I also noticed people posting quite a lot about BTCPay lately, and I thought all those videos may be a bit confusing for true newbs, so this wraps everything into one easy to understand series.
You [can find video playlist here]( but please note that Deploying BTCPay Server video (STEP 7.2) is now replaced [with this new method]( which takes less than 1 minute to deploy BTCPay from the web-interface.
If you're considering this and need some help, feel free to reply here. I'll be happy to help you out. I am not shilling any course, I'm not asking for donations or anything, I just want more merchants in this space.
I'm available on BTCPay Slack, there's a channel  there so if you need help, just ping me

Also recently, a developer built a bookkeeping [integration for BTCPay and QuickBooks]( if there are any BTCPay merchants lurking here, you may find his screencast handy.

@_date: 2018-12-14 19:28:46
This is just one way to handle fiat conversion. Devs are working with few exchanges so there will be more options soon. It's great that merchants can have the freedom to chose how they want their BTC to be converted. While this solution is not something I *personally* prefer, I applaud Blockonomics for their efforts, it's great to see people building stuff on top of BTPay.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:51:52


Correct, my philosophy is that instant fiat conversion does nothing to the ecosystem. It's just another way of selling Bitcoin. But it's easy for me to play smart-pants when I don't' run a large business. 
We keep it and try to keep it in the ecosystem as long as possible. However, the store is tiny, with just a few orders per week so for us I must say it's easy. We also did many other things to minimize the risks (for example one of our suppliers was persuaded to take BTC, we also try to manufacture the order on demand). When we sell, I try to use decentralized exchanges like Bisq.
I know this all sounds great, but for bigger systems, this way of doing business is just too cumbersome and risky. We're small, so we adjusted quickly. Also, our customer are true Bitcoiners who appreciate and understand our business model, so it's easy to explain to them why their order takes more time to process, etc.
Does that help? I'm not sure if I was clear enough.

What are you talking about?
Why do you judge by a title of a Reddit post.
Have you even read the article?
A third party company completely unrelated to BTCPay project implemented a way for merchants to convert to fiat which can be used in BTCPay.
Come on...

Awesome, there are lots of tutorials in the docs and also videos community is making. If you need any help feel free to drop by on [BTCPay Slack]( nearly 1000 members there, I'm sure you'll get good help there.

Uhh, this is a complex topic. There are so many factors. It depends, simple as that.
I'm thinking about merchant adoption almost every day. Unfortunately, BitcoinShirt is new, tiny business, with low volume and risks. To illustrate the scale, there are only 2 of us behind it. So it's easy to adapt, be flexible. Also, the customer base are tech people, familiar with Bitcoin, so we really don't see that many problems, but some pointed out in the article are valid.
What is needed is merchant education. Why there is no a non-profit that would provide a legal and accounting help, lobby and resources. Information that we have on bitcoin.org and other sites are too generic, it's just theory and does not apply in practice. Why aren't these billion dollar exchanges engaged in this? It would benefit them as well since merchants mostly convert BTC for now. Oh yes, they are busy patenting BUIDL...
In the ideal world, there would be some sort of organization that would provide resources, give-away free POS (for example BTCPay POS with the full node) and be funded by huge exchanges who benefit from the economy. Hell, I would even tell merchants that if they want all this, they can convert to fiat, but need to have at least 1% in BTC and spread it through their supply chain. But this is not how decentralized systems work I'm afraid.
EDIT: Just to clarify I don't think adoption can be forced, merchants who already decided they want to accept Bitcoin may need a bit more help and resources and with time that will come hopefully.
I think Sergej from Bitrefill does a good job at trying to spread the adoption and actually talks about problems and hardships.
The good thing about Bitcoin is that if small guys who want to do commerce, they don't have to give damn about anything, however, for legal businesses, it's tricky...they need to integrate it into their day to day, they need help understanding.
I'm sorry this was a huge rant.  The merchant adoption question is very complex and I fail at conveying my ideas via Reddit most of the times.
Edit 2: Even though my post may seem as pessimistic, I am quite optimistic about what the future hodls. There are so many great adoption examples and projects I witnessed lately. We're just not ready for mass adoption yet. One day. It just seems that so many resources both human and financial went to wrong this in this space for the past few years, but I think that'll fix itself very soon.

It's actually not just a way for newbies. There are probably easier custodial ways for newbies to accept payments. What BTCPay does, is it frees newbies, by getting rid of a third party. You're your own payment processor. You control customers data (PayPal leaks data to 600 companies) there are no processing fees (you wouldn't charge fees to yourself would you?), you're running a full Bitcoin node and on top of that getting bunch of innovative features. This is just a rant. For more refer to [BTCPay extensive documentation]( Hope that helps.
I think the website covers the basics well? No?

BTCPay is not doing any conversion nor will it EVER do it. It will probably let exchanges plug in their own solutions.
There's a link to their article in the tweet, where any sane person would understand this plugin or however you want to call it, has nothing to do with BTCPay, nor did any BTCPay community members provided a way for them to plug in. Blockonomics took their time and created their own solution that fits into BTCPay.
But this way of decentralizing options for merchants is good for several reasons:
1. The merchant can select an exchange/solution which helps him with local laws
2. The Merchant has a freedom of choice to choose an exchange which is most cost-effective and coherent with business philosophy.
In BTCPay merchants were always owners of their own keys and fiat exchange was ALWAYS possible, but it was not instant. When you own your keys, you have the freedom to decide when, where and how to convert, if conversion is your thing.
There are several independents teams working on different solutions afaik, not really my field of interest. As for Blockonomics technical questions, you'd have to ask them, I haven't tried it as it does not fit my philosophy and needs, but perhaps someone will find it useful.

Cool, I don't think it was rude at all just had to be more specific.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:16:52
Okay, there's a much easier way if anyone else wants to try.
* Setup BTCPay server in 2 minutes make sure to select c-lightning implementation 
* BTCPay and Spark integration works out of the box, acccess it from btcpay (browser) or QR scan and it's on your phone.

It doesn't relate at all, two completely different things. You're referring to Eclair wallet, btcpay is a full node that has LN implementation on top.
You can get payments from eclair wallet in your shop if that's your concern.

That's centralized to be fair. How you charge transaction fees if it's decentralized? It's not private either.
Don't get me wrong, more payment processors = great
But don't use false marketing and buzzwords which aren't correct.
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:53:11
If you can deplatform a customer, it's not decentralized. If users are not running a node it's not private. If you claim something that's not true, that's false advertising.
Kudos for non-custodial though. As I said the more processors the better.

@_date: 2018-12-18 21:57:01
That's quite accurate.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:52:34
This is now fixed, thanks again.
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:31:43
Good ideas, maybe good for a future post, though I'm sure such post would require joint effort of several merchants, so if anyone wants to help, ping me.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:42:26
We already know who the person is, since they were legally obligated to tell us that from the start, but we had to submit a formal letter anyways.
The status: waiting for Reddit to bring the post back online if the person does not reply.
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:29:08
Decentralized and private apparently but process payments through a centralized node?

There are tons of visualisers, [see this list](

Nice catch, I was able to replicate it, only happens with 1$, thanks a lot, will open an issue on GitHub for this. 
Edit: it happens with few more values, will tell someone in the community to look into it, thanks again.
