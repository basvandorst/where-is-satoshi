buying something is using a currency.

You know what sends the exact same message to apple, simply recycling your iphone and buying a fucking android. Apple does not give a shit about what people on this subreddit do and I don't know why anyone would think they do. This might get some articles on a few no-name blogs but other than that this is strictly a circlejerk for the sake of of the worst kind.

If that's the case then this is probably a good move. I'd rather them continue there streak of not screwing up than have to divert their attention to something they deem unnecessary.

except that's an enormous pain in the ass if I would rather sit in fiat after a huge rise and chances are prices are going to drop.

Dude I will be the first to say it, barring iTunes and some early computer related things Apple doesn't invent much of anything, they take the idea of a product from someone and make it 10x better then they could've made it. As a consumer I do not give a single fuck about who invented the idea, I want the best iteration of a product I can buy. If that means I buy it from someone who took the idea from someone else then so be it, it's not my problem as a consumer.

I love how apple fanboys are considered to be the worst people on the internet and then people like you exist. I can't even tell if you're a troll honestly.

No. They just don't feel the need to start a thread every time someone starts accepting btc for some obscure thing no one gives a fuck about.

"Oh oh I know what to do! I'll put a picture of him and his home along with his estimated net worth on the internet."

when it's volatile it's an investment and when it's stable it's a currency, and sometimes it's commodity and I think on tuesday nights it dresses up as payment system but we don't like to talk about that.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:37:14
So you can't prove it is him and you can't prove it's not him. So just to be safe you decided to put all of his personal information on the internet along with the fact that he has hundreds of millions of dollars in an untraceable currency?

Pretty big car guy. I daily a G37s but I'm starting to think about importing an R32 GTS (I'm a rwd guy) to the U.S now that their legal. Absolutely love those things.

a legion a of people who think a 6 month old meme is still funny
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:06:39
What exactly was bullshit about that statement?
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:22:30
It reflects how that one redditor thinks, not the majority. Which is why you see garbage getting on the front page pretty consistently.

I also use bitfinex but that was not very reassuring, imo. When the largest exchange goes under you should expect people to be wary of doing business with any exchange. Providing a little reassurance seems like it would be worth, for them, in the long run.

That happened long before these stupid videos.

Winamp worked/looked like total garbage, all of the mp3 players looked and worked like garbage, blackberries were ok but a totally different beast compared to iphones, iPad looked and worked leagues better than anything on the market. 
I will gladly pay more money for things that work and look better.
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:05:35
I did infact have to use multiple mp3 players and win amp back in the day. Even used a zune at one point.  And yes, Apple didn't invent the idea of the tablet much like Toyota or Honda didn't invent the idea of the motor vehicle. Did you look at the picture in the article? It looks shows no resemblance whatsoever except for the name which wasn't rightfully there's because


So LG had a concept of a tablet before Apple, cool.

Wow dude you're a complete dick bag. you either have no social skills in the real world or you're just an internet asshole. delete this shit.
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:08:43
this is pretty funny coming from someone just regurgitating shit they read on the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:10:28


Even before this event, if you asked people outside of this sub what they think of this was their response. This just made it worse.
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:29:49




lmao good one dude
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:25:13
Why are some people trolls? Why does anyone lie on the internet ever? 


It makes his e-weiner feel huuge.
@_date: 2013-10-03 12:57:57


I also think this. But does it matter? The fact that it's on record that he was "willing" to have someone killed for money is enough, isn't it?

You also have to verify your identity, and in my case they have fucked up information from whatever database they pull from. Been trying to get verified for the past month and half now.
