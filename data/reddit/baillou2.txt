I'd be just as excited. 
We all stand to become wealthy in ways that have nothing to do with currency as a result of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin allows us to transact VALUE, whatever that may be for an individual. Money is just a middle-man.
My hope is that cryptocurrency will make money obsolete as in "a non-issue". 
What if we lived in a world where financial wealth was no longer an issue? Would you be sad or happy? Many people would be sad because their lives would be without purpose, which is itself a sad fact.
Life is meant to be lived, not subsidized.

Indeed Mt Gox and all other exchanges don't even manage private keys "on your behalf", they simple keep a ledger of who bought what and for how much.
It's only when you cash out that anything moves. This is why an exchange can be completely insolvent and still facilitate millions of dollars in transactions (so long as no one tries to withdraw". Because it's all just numbers.

If Gox really does disappear for good I don't see it as being that big a deal for the growing market.
It's a brick wall for those of us already in the Bitcoin space, but the rest of the world either won't hear about this, or won't know what they're hearing. Certainly not enough to worry them permanently into a state of perpetual fear of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has had all kinds of bad news over the years, and it's still here. Things change quickly in this space.

Here's hoping it stays dead. FOREVER!

It's a cultural difference.
1. Linux users tend to be more tech-savvy and secure.
2. tech-savvy people are more likely to use Bitcoin.
At the same time remember that Linux makes up a very small percentage of OS's in the world so it's not surprising that there's so little malware.
I think that if Linux users made up 21% of all desktops in the world then we'd see much higher incidents of malware with Bitcoin.
When it comes to malware the old adage should be "There's danger in numbers" as in a nice big easily infected target. Linux users are spread out and thin on the ground making it much harder to infect the herd.

What I meant was it's fair with respect to the target commodity. You may have stolen a ton of Bitcoin, but the only way to get my own awesomeCoin is to send to a one-way address, and that goes for me as well.
In this way it's not possible for me to hoard my own self-invented currency.
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:14:48
Okay. So it's not completely random. Though it could be just about anything, so I would say it qualifies as salt.
Maybe the passphrase is:
in the deepest oxean the bottom of the sea
-replace all "C"s with "X".
From your POV it is random to be sure.

True. But nonetheless it would never be hacked. If it's long enough repeated sequences of that type are statistically never going to be found. 
If they could be then my own brainwallets would have been stolen a long time ago since I use actual words (mostly). My current brainwallets are 1,000's of times easier to find by comparison, and yet they never have.
I've tested the threshold of what's secure many times. I do it for fun with small amounts of BTC. I can guarantee that the above phrase is way more than enough entropy.

I'm still not convinced these dips are due to panic, but rather they are just an unspoken coordinated sell-off in order to buy back in low at the expense of those who don't watch the news 24/7.
Speculators do this ALL THE TIME. No one's panicking. They're just playing the game.
If I had the time and was willing to make BTC my life I'd probably do the same thing.

@_date: 2014-01-27 17:44:18
Perhaps. But really I think it's a way for those "in the know" to coordinate a sell-off in order to buy in low.
It's a great way for everyone to get on the same page without having to orchestrate a sell-off among so many disparate investors. 
The easiest way to see that this is the case is to watch go right back up within a few hours (a day at most). I'd pretty damn amazed if BTC wasn't back in the 800's Bistamp price by tomorrow.

So I created an account and put about 5 addresses in it. I really like it. The only thing I might like to see is a ticker or whatever it's called that shows the aggregate value of the addresses according to Bitstamp or other exchanges. btcbalance.net has that feature, and it's a little thing that's nice to have.
What you have so far is already better since there are no weird bugs like btcbalance. I had no trouble adding and labeling my addresses.
I'm sure you're going to do a lot of cosmetic stuff once you get going so I won't bother saying anything about that.
Overall it's nice, and I hope you decide to keep it up. I'll definitely use it constantly!

No, it's a refund.
The original transaction cannot be undone, but yes, of course you can always send the BTC back to the customer.
It sounds like a technical difference, but it's a VERY important one. Credit card transactions CAN be reversed. Bitcoin transactions are solely one way. You can only ever "give it back", you can't un-give it.

If I were suspected of stealing $10.00 you would just want $10.00 dollars back, right?
I seriously doubt you would say "no, not that ten bucks, but the other one that has this particular serial number on it."
At any rate, I agree the silk road users should get their money back, but who cares which bitcoins are used. I CANNOT see what difference that makes. If John Smith had 5 BTC taken from him, then the USMS should give him back 5 BTC because THEY are the ones who took it.
Whoever bought the BTC at the auction is not relevant in the least to reimbursing the silk road users. The Gov't took the BTC so the gov't should give it back.
A huge majority of American green backs are used for all types of crimes and nefarious purposes. Should I go through my wallet and find out who had which bills stolen and then try to give the money back? 
The money I have is from my paycheck, so does my employer have to return particular bills that have once been used in a crime? Where does this end? Seriously, what's the endgame here?
If you think the BTC should be returned to it's rightful owners then go tell the USMS, not some dude who bought BTC at an auction.

So if I buy a new flat screen TV from Best Buy with cash, does the government know where that money came from? I'm guessing not. We already enjoy a great deal of anonymity with fiat when compared to Bitcoin. That's the sad reality. This DOES need to be fixed. Compliance will become a non-issue when governments have no choice. This is a long view but it's the right one. It may hinder the value of BTC in the short term, but some things are more important than speculating Wall Street douchebags.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:14:29
I agree with your last sentence. Bitcoin needs to spread enough to not get caught in such huge chunks in one place. I suppose that will take time.
And while Mt Gox very often was the word most often associated with Bitcoin, now that it's gone, HURRAY, the fucking media will just have to use new words, maybe even explain a little more exactly what Gox's role was in relation to Bitcoin.
I realize it can be difficult when the media is only interested in sound bites for a half-listening public.
It reminds me A LOT of when the shuttle program was canceled at NASA. Everyone (including TV personalities) was saying that NASA was canceled. It was too hard for the public to disassociate a vehicle from a government agency. That might happen here too, but it'll be okay in the long run.j
I think people generally believe NASA still exists, and the shuttle is fading into the past. Gox will too.

But every panic seller is potentially doing the same thing you are. The only "dumb" thing that one can do is not buy back in at/near the bottom.

One question for you though. Why wouldn't the salt need to be hidden? If I get your password and the salt is stored as plain text, then I'd be able to hash the two and get your private key. Right?

I'd say it's a combination of hubris, and laziness.
There are clearly a lot of people who got in on Bitcoin quite early, and have since discovered huge amounts of wealth as a result, but they didn't really work for it. It's not their life savings. It's their little hobby that just happened to blow up in value.
And so what do you do when you come across huge sums of money out of the blue, well, you do stupid shit.

If it's as good as you say it is then you really wouldn't need to try. The benefit would be self evident.

Are you seriously gonna tell me that what I just typed in the previous post risks being duplicated somewhere?
As a side note. I use brainwallets all the time. Mostly for long term cold storage, and I've never had a single satoshi stolen. And I DO use passphrases, just not ones you or anyone else will ever crack. I understand the importance of entropy and probability, and the difference between the two.
I would agree with most people that brainwallets are dangerous for most people, BUT if you know what you're doing they are perfectly safe. I've heard agruments against brainwallets a hundred times in this subreddit, and most of them are good ones, but only if you don't know what you're doing, which I'll grant is most people.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:12:16
I know all about the sport of brainwallet cracking.
But the math and physics don't lie. Even something like:
sDSGFRT %%GFGT sksdgjuytrertytrevbv)87 where you can probably spot how lazy I was with the keyboard is NEVER going to be cracked. I just won't be. 
I once put a small amount of BTC in a brainwallet created from one word of only 10 characters in length, then I changed one of the letters randomly: ex "ecosystebs"
and it took about a month for someone to finally take it. Bear in mind that there are many hackers out there with rigs that run 24/7, and it STILL took a month.
It can be hard to grasp how VAST the scale of entropy is.
It would be like comparing how long it takes to walk a million miles versus walking a trillion. One is a much larger distance, but you have no hope of walking either.

I get what you're saying. But that actually surprises me then. How is Sourceforge as popular as it is? It seems like one is taking a HUGE risk downloading from them.
I agree with the OP that Github would be a better idea.
I suppose sites like Sourceforge aren't bad for most things. But Bitcoin software is like the Grand daddy of targets these days. 
In retrospect we should have been surprised if this DIDN'T happen.
I don't think I'm exaggerating by saying that. Where Bitcoin is involved, if it can be hacked, it will be, as sure as the sun will rise.

Joe seems like a genuinely nice guy who has a huge amount of interest in many things, but he lacks the critical thinking skills to evaluate subject matter.
I think of him as a would-be scientist/philosopher who never grasped the importance of evidence based research and arguing from first principles. As a result he goes on tangents about some pretty ridiculous stuff.

No way of knowing. It's probably a lot of things.
But I'd say the fall of Mt Gox is a big part of it.
After all, anyone dumb enough to use that exchange was probably also trigger-happy with their trades.
Just a month ago we could read that "maybe this or that company will accept Bitcoin" and the price would fluctuate wildly.
Nowadays it's like all the good or bad news in the world has no effect. My guess is that it's because the Gox traders are gone. They were the wild ones. And now they're dead.

I think it would be an awesome idea. I really want a site (or client) that does this well.
Unless I'm doing something wrong Blockchain.info only allows the watch only addresses to be incorporated with the funds you actually have and so you can't tell the difference. Also there's no way of undoing it that I've found.
Then there's btcbalance.net. This site is almost perfect but it's a little buggy. I have the worst time labeling the addresses, which is a must for me. Otherwise I quickly lose track of which addresses have the BTC. 
Let me know if you get it up for public use.

Also if you DO have your life savings in Bitcoin DON'T keep it all at one address, DON'T move it all in one lump sum. DON'T use software that isn't guaranteed to be free of malware.

It amazes the lengths people will go to in order to store their Bitcoin when the easiest (AND MOST SECURE) thing you can do is just put it on paper wallets.
WHY, WHY, why would you transfer such an insane amount of money to someone you don't know in order to get shiny coins.
What happened sucks, but I almost have no sympathy.
My theory on why these things happen so often is that the ones losing vast amounts of Bitcoin never really earned them.

You would import the private key that you derived from the passphrase into a bitcoin client and then send it wherever you want. You could do it with a blockchain.info wallet, or the bitcoin.qt client, or an electrum wallet etc.
@_date: 2014-01-26 15:58:00
Yes, you can add/replace/move characters. But the majority/if not all the original characters are there. So that should help narrow things down. And the salt would never be something like, say, adding 54jkfj5kmn after each word. If there is anything added to the passphrase it would be significantly smaller than that.
Maybe it is a fools errand. I'm not sure myself since I don't crack passphrases for a living.
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:24:11

I agree with everything you said. Maybe this is more of a real-life experiment which will yield empirical data on how secure a passphrase can be.
Had I made a post saying:
Here is my passphrase and I'll salt by doing X, I'm sure I'd get a SHIT-TON of comments saying how bad of an idea that would be; that I'd be asking to get my BTC stolen. But as we can see that's hardly true.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:15:58
That's what I'm hoping too.
I'd like to see it go even further down. I need a few months to buy up and meet my goal; from there I hold for a LONG time.
But I'll probably never get the chance. So everyone stop complaining. Bitcoin will be shooting up soon enough. Whoever doesn't own a whole Bitcoin now, and isn't in a high income bracket probably has one last chance over the next few months before it becomes impossible to acquire one.
@_date: 2014-06-25 13:03:49

Wow. Good to know this about brainwallet.org.
Personally if I were to use that functionality I'd probably cut and paste a bunch of gobbledygook into the passphrase field and use that.
I never had any real suspicions that brainwallet.org was shady, but as you can see it's still not truly secure.
If randomness is what you want then it's always best to generate it yourself. And don't listen to those who will tell you that your randomness isn't random enough. It's quite easy just so long as you're not stupid and type something short and/or common.
Another thing though. Since all 18 wallets were swiped it's clear that the "random" addresses are generated in a deterministic fashion from the first one. That sure as hell isn't random.

I agree with what you say.
But I'd point out that Reddit is very often NOT the place to get informed, well reasoned arguments.
My best suggestion would be bitcointalk.org. The real stuff that's going to move Bitcoin and other cryptos into the mainstream is most likely stuff that neither you or I would understand. 
People on this subreddit like to talk a lot about Bitcoin the currency. But there's way more to it than that, and it's rarely ever discussed. What I pay attention to is the layers of abstraction and infrastructure being built on top of the Bitcoin protocol. I could care less about what new business is accepting it. 
Anyway I'm going on. Sorry to rant.
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:29:47
That won't happen until around 2141. I don't mean to put off a valid argument, but my guess is that by that time (with any luck) we will have something FAR better than either Bitcoin OR fiat in place.
Maybe money won't even exist. I know it sounds crazy, but the world changes faster than most realize because our lives are so short.
Also Bitcoin won't be the only cryptocurrency. There will be many others designed for various uses. So I'm not saying that Bitcoin specifically will be the future, but cryptocurrencies will.

What makes Bitcoin so secure and resistant to attacks of various types is that it is decentralized, specifically it's the block chain that needs to be decentralized. So the more copies of the block chain there are the harder it is for an attacker to focus on a handful of running nodes because there would be literally (potentially) millions of PC's across the planet, all of them with the same copy of the block chain. It would be exceedingly hard to subvert such a network, if not completely impossible for all practical purposes.

Well I don't have a better term than salt. But to be clear "salt" as you describe is also a possibility. If changing the length by adding more characters is salting, then yes, it could be that.
Think about it. Maybe the system is: add "lol" before all the words, or every other word. In a previous post I did point out that in order to keep it reasonably crackable the salt would not be something like 45fkkdhh409, a length of characters that long would be extremely difficult to crack even by itself, never mind adding it somewhere in a passphrase.

Yes, anyone can see what amount is at that address by going to blockchain.info and pasting the address into the "Look up" field, or whatever it's called.
One reason you don't see addresses posted here is because it's against this subreddit's policy. 
Look on the right side of the screen and you'll see the following:
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

Mining produces more bitcoin because that's how the Bitcoin protocol was designed. What's equally important about miners is that they secure the network by the very act of mining. This is because in order to mine bitcoin you have to confirm transactions. These confirmations are what prevent double spending. It's obviously more technical than that, but that's the gist of it.

I do something similar too. What I do for all my brainwallets is use the same passphrase for all of them, but I add a word/number to the end of that phrase to generate new wallets.
That way I can essentially store the info I need (the word at the end) in a dropbox folder labeled "Bitcoin passphrases", and no one would be able to crack my wallets because all they get is the last word. The bulk of the main passphrase is only stored in my head.
This may end up being a bad idea if the value of Bitcoin goes up to $5,000 per coin as I would want to leave it to family if I got hit by a bus, and they wouldn't have a chance of guessing the passphrase. But for now it's a risk I'm willing to take.
@_date: 2014-01-26 06:37:12
Which is exactly why I personally believe a little salt goes a long way, even for the worst of passphrases.

As far as I can reckon, here's what would happen.
I want to buy a property worth 40 million BTC (valued at around $450.00 per Bitcoin).
So I take my massive USD bank account and start buying up Bitcoin, the value starts to skyrocket as a consequence. At some point the value of the Bitcoin I own will equal the amount I need in USD (whatever that is: I don't have a calculator handy). 
So voila! It might even be a good idea to do this since you probably wouldn't need to spend as much money. As the value of a Bitcoin goes up the Bitcoin you've already purchased at the lower price go up.
In other words you'd never need to spend 40 million Bitcoin. You'd only need to spend as many as you need to make the purchase, and that amount will go up as you buy up.

The idea that "this money here" is worth less than "that money over there" because someone you don't like held it for a while is a dangerous idea. VERY BAD IDEA!

People send you Bitcoin by sending it to that address. Once you have it, and let's say you want to spend it, you will need the private key which I assume you have.

I think it would be pretty easy to confirm though. Something that shows what blocks are being mined and by which computers. There must be some way to be certain about this. It would be in their benefit to gain the trust of the community.
Also, from the CEO's perspective it doesn't matter if there's 1, 2 or 500 separate pools. Either way they collect fees for their service, so why not be fair and trustworthy? All the more subscribers if they can verify this.

I agree, but I thought you were the one saying it fluctuates on bad news, which it does. I was just saying in order for it to be worth much more it will have to have already overcome such market fickleness. And I think it will. 
There's still a long way to go. The total market cap is only in the 8 billion dollar range. Of course it will have to grow much more, and of course critics will say "see, it's too damn volatile." But that's okay. That's part of the growth process.
I don't wanna go off on a tangent, but I can never fathom why economists hate the volatility so much when they MUST know it's a nascent and growing technology. 
It's like saying teenagers are too volatile because they're constantly growing out of their clothes and changing their tastes in music, and therefore they should be done away with. Such myopic views.

I would never call you an idiot based on your passion for Bitcoin. I share it.
I would however say you were lucky, for multiple reasons, but the biggest is that no one could have known for sure if this thing would really take off. We still don't know if it'll be around a year from now.
Personally I'm bullish, but we just don't know.
But like they say, luck is when preparation meets opportunity, or something like that. 
You weren't randomly lucky, you took a calculated risk, and it paid off, which is still luck to some extent, but it's also the result of your understanding of something few others could grasp at the time. And most, I imagine still can't.
I wish I would have know about Bitcoin even just a year ago, unfortunately I had never heard of it until April. So I was unlucky in that sense, but I was also lucky to be smart enough to get that this was something big.
Anyway, semantics. Don't listen to those people. They still don't get it, which is why they will continue to be, shall we say, "unlucky". :-)

Well, if they were stolen then they would still be in circulation, just stolen.
But I do often wonder how many coins are gone forever due to lost keys. That would be something to know.
It highlights just how small the market really is. I wouldn't be surprised if an 8 billion dollar market cap is really somewhere around 7 billion.

True, but it's easier to label the problem as MT Gox since it's the most visible part of the process.

If so I'm all for it.
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:18:07
Mes means month in Spanish, but the word comes from Moon. I'm not sure how far back one has to go, maybe proto-Latin or somewhere around there. Basically the words moon, month, mes, myasets (russian), mond (German for moon), monat (german for month), minas (greek for month) etc... you get the idea.
So anyway I just thought it was interesting that the Aztec word for moon was metztli, that's freakily close to the indo-european word for moon/month.

That's not what net neutrality means at all. No one has a problem with first class internet, and indeed there should be a price difference. Some ISP's are better than others and that's fine. The problem is that once you're using the internet, do they control what you can and can't do? 
It's like paying a lot of money for a really NICE sports car (no problem there), but then being told where you can drive it, and how fast, and how often etc.

Because fixing it might put a dent in the value. Getting in line with regulators and governments makes everyone feel safe and happy that it won't be outlawed.
But I do think one way or another it will be fixed. The question is will Bitcoin be fixed, or will we all end up switching to another currency that maintains anonymity? 
It should be fixed yesterday by the core developers, but they're busy bending over for Fincen.

I honestly have no idea.

@_date: 2014-02-04 06:20:09
I was just thinking a few hours ago that with a price around $800.00 the Bitcoin economy essentially grows by 3 million dollars per day, give or take because of the newly mined coins every ten minutes (on average).
So wouldn't this mean that the Bitcoin ecosystem could grow 3 million dollars per day and yet never go up in value per BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-25 01:03:31
Does anyone think that the growing velocity of Bitcoin is contributing its lack of growth in value?
I honestly have no idea. Of course USING Bitcoin is awesome, that's the whole point. But it would seem to me that these vendors are just converting Bitcoin to fiat through Bitpay and the others. And I assume Bitpay just puts the BTC back on the market.
I'm not complaining about price, I was just wondering if this could be the reason.

You make a good point about the stem for all my wallets. I have full confidence in the entropy of the stem, so my only concern would be malware that might log my keystrokes.

You're probably right. I don't want to tell everyone to give up, but I don't want anyone to waste their time either.
The real point of doing this is to show how secure a teeny bit of entropy can be, even when used with a known passphrase.
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:14:08
One would have to use a coin mixer of some sort. Even then it wouldn't be completely anonymous.
I don't know enough details to guess how doable complete anonymity would be. For examply you could use a site like Satoshi dice, make a 97% bet (still risky) and get the coin back, but it wouldn't be the ones you put in. BUT you would still be receiving the BTC at the same address it was sent from.
So.... yeah, I have no idea....
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:31:04
Thanks for all the help.
So M would represent the minimum number of necessary keys to make a transaction?
And N is simply the total number.

So I won't say. Sorry.
If a full month goes by with no winner, I gotta say, I'm gonna be much more confrontational with passphrase detractors who love going on about how horrible such methods are.
So in my best car salesman voice: I'm practically giving this 0.5 BTC away! Don't miss your chance to own it!
Maybe for an encore I'll give the "salt" and the challenge will be to guess the initial passphrase which will be something a lot of people may know (like a song lyric). Seems there would be a good chance no one would get that one either.
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:39:41

@_date: 2014-01-26 19:47:57
The rule is simple.
For my personal brainwallets I don't use a rule, but rather I use a unique passphrase that is always the same, and then add a word to the end of it to generate new wallets. So I keep track of the words at the end and I never write down the main passphrase. I actually store my words in my Dropbox account. It wouldn't matter if it were hacked because the hacker wouldn't have the passphrase. I don't write that down anywhere.
At the moment all my BTC is kept under: never, bull, black, joke, moon. Now you'd just have to guess the long-ass passphrase that precedes the words. But good luck with that. lol

@_date: 2013-11-05 09:30:02
A brain wallet is perfectly secure so long as your passphrase cannot be guessed against all conceivable odds.
A simple method would be a lengthy memorable phrase WITH some sort of salt or randomizing change.
I love cats because they can't spell = bad pass phrase
I lover catsd becauser theyu can'ty spell; = good pass phrase
See the pattern? :-)
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:09:50
The idea is that once it's printed you CAN'T access it. At least not without importing the private key, at which point the paper wallet is no longer secure, indeed it's no longer a paper wallet by definition.
Paper wallets are for storing BTC. Like putting something in one of those U-Store places. You can't use your flat screen tv if it's in storage, but you can retrieve it when you need it.

I store my BTC in a brainwallet. No HDD, no paper.

A couple weeks ago, for some random fluke reason, I was able to purchase 0.07 BTC from Coinbase. The price was around $250 or whatever it was. But then the next day I tried to buy 0.07 and I got the usual message about there being a 0.1 BTC minimum amount.

Unless someone breaks into my house, attaches a neural scanner to my brain, fires up the delta-wave-inversion-transmogifier and extracts the passphrase from my mind...   oh shit, never mind a gun to the head. This is worse. 
Now what do we do???? I'm so scared.

Something that will allow people secure access to their bitcoin whilst simultaneously making it almost impossible for them to lose it, e.g. phone lost/HDD crashed/forgot passphrase.
Bitcoin MUST be recoverable even in the worst case scenarios. I've heard of WAY TOO MANY Bitcoin savvy enthusiasts who lost BTC due to something like this.
What chance does the general public have?
EDIT: I'm not talking about charge reversals or anything like that. Just making BTC as idiotproof as humanely possible.

No. Or yes, depending on how you look at it. In order to challenge your address they would have to challenge all others by necessity. Indeed, not just all addresses on the blockchain, but all possible addresses, which is a number too big to comprehend even if you had an extra-terrestrial aliens brain.
Knowing your address tells me nothing about the possible passphrase that could have generated it. It's a ONE WAY road.

I'm witcha, homie.

@_date: 2013-12-16 16:46:29
But the math works out in my case. I've already used more than I've put in. The rest is icing on the cake.
If I gave you $100.00 and you decided to gamble with it and you lost, did you lose a hundred dollars? Maybe, but considering that I gave it to you it's just as correct to say that you never really had it in the first place, and that I'm the one who lost the money.
@_date: 2013-09-15 05:40:39
I use the same passphrase and just change the last word. I don't think remembering should be too hard. If it is then you have a poor imagination. 
People get hung up on making it "unique", but really it just needs to be highly unlikely to be guessed which kinda the same thing. 
There are phrases all around us. Maybe I choose to make my passphrases lines from a book starting on page one. As long as I can remember that the book is the key I'm good.
Maybe lyrics to a song with a little $%) thrown in at the end. How often do you forget lyrics to your favorite songs? And if so how hard is it to look it up? The possibilities are endless. It's not that hard. It just requires a little creative thinking.
@_date: 2013-09-29 22:22:59
That's a good way of putting it. 
I should have said "get a feel" and I could have avoided all the grief.
My data is very limited, but it is empirical. Some phrases were cracked, others weren't. I leave it up to you to draw your own conclusions. I can only conclude that not a single bot was able to get my BTC for certain phrases after a week's time. To me, this means that those trying to swipe BTC aren't able to in certain cases when certain types of passphrases are used.
What it means to you is up to you.
I wonder if I put BTC in a passphrase such as "salle de bain" and a year goes by without it being cracked. Would that mean it's secure? I really don't know. I would say it's not. But the results don't lie. Strange paradox.
@_date: 2013-09-20 03:34:41
I don't know. It is a concern depending on how paranoid you are. I would prefer complete anonymity but I'm too lazy to do anything else. Coinbase is just so easy. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:40:58
What you say is all true.
But I would add:
Remember, Bitcoin is a protocol, and it's the best protocol for storing and exchanging value/ownership. This in itself IS valuable. This is what makes it worth something. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 21:14:05
The best thing to do to prevent this is to "have your affairs in order" as they say. Maybe a safety deposit box with your passphrases or something like that.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:15:09
Because it would require changing certain properties of the universe with respect to energy and time in order to do so.
@_date: 2013-05-07 03:33:42
So at blockchain.info when you look at an address you can also see how much is there.
For instance someone gives you $40.00 in bitcoin, and then I can check your address where it was sent and see how much is there?
@_date: 2013-10-25 03:17:28
Dude, just create your own addresses. If you want to be "random" and you don't trust yourself with a unique passphrase, you can go to brainwallet.org and type in, I dunno, aldkjsflkjsd4i58u8{ewwWWrtM&lt;&gt;LI08
that'll do you just fine.
And you can kill your internet once you're on the page just to be comfortable.
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:06:22
These scenarios are getting crazy. I don't know what to say.
I use a brain wallet, but I suppose the thief could just say "Tell me the passphrase or I'll shoot".
BTW This hypothetical robber is really well informed AND willing to risk murder. If I were him, like most thieves, I'd just break in and steel what I wanted. Way easier.
@_date: 2013-11-01 06:09:10
Satoshi is a wild card. There's just no way of knowing what he'll/they'll do. Satoshi doesn't have wealth tied up in equity. My theory is that his BTC will never move. But it's just a gut feeling. The Winklevii will be prudent, I'm sure, so I'm less worried about them.
But in any case I just wonder if that much LimboBitcoin is enough to damage the confidence that other investors would otherwise have in the currency.
@_date: 2013-10-26 18:05:23
I like conducting little experiments with brainwallets and small amounts of BTC. 
Right now I have an address I generated from 10 characters. It's a word that has one letter misspelled and so far it hasn't been swiped.
I would NEVER suggest doing this for storing BTC, but it is interesting how all these "billions of addresses" generated by bots patrolling the blockchain don't include such a shitty passphrase anywhere in their list.
I guess I'll agree with everyone else so I don't catch hell, but brainwallets are fine if you're creative enough.
The real trick isn't memorizing phrases, it's memorizing how you generate entropy. 
A good start for example might be to always:
1. Change all A's to X's.
2. Capitalize 3rd letter where applicable.
3. Put all passphrases within (({...}))
Now, to whoever is in the business of cracking brainwallets, get off your lazy ass and crack MINE! I made it super-fucking-easy.
Sorry, I'm just not impressed. I can't give these BTC away. And I'm trying!

I think your math is a little off there.

Right, so does anyone think this can happen on a large scale?
I don't know how many people own more than 1 or two BTC at the moment. But I would guess it's AT LEAST a couple hundred thousand. Are they all to become millionaires and billionaires? Is that how the world works? Like, every neighborhood in the country will have that one guy who has more money than he knows what to do with? That's a realistic scenario? People in China right now are going to be richer than most Americans. People in America and Europe are going to be richer than most Greek Gods?

@_date: 2013-11-01 02:55:21
What you said in the first sentence is how I think things will actually work. Only it will happen a LOT sooner in the process than most Bitcoin fans think. 
They all seem to think (myself included sometimes) that they will be able to hold onto the 5 BTC they bought once they reach 10,000 in value, and STILL hold on when the price hits 50,000, and even STILL hold on, well you get the idea.
My prediction (if BTC rises in a huge way), is that for every substantial - or even modest - rise in value there will be that many more people cashing out or spending the BTC, which will bring the value down slightly, but now distributed among more people.
In other words - if I'm honest with my broke-ass-self), if a single bitcoin goes up to $5,000 in value, yeah, I'm spending a little of that. I don't want to, but I probably would, and so will everyone else.
I'm gonna try and hold though.
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:50:59
A more realistic scenario would be VISA and the like reducing their tx fees. That would be a good thing.
I would echo what a lot of people have already said here, and I would add that Bitcoin is EXTREMELY UNIQUE in that it started out as the first and therefore almost worthless cryptocurrency. This is important because it has allowed BTC to grow organically in value. There's always bubbles and so on, but nothing like what you need to overcome with a VisaCoin, which would end up being so unstable that no one would trust it.
As it is, a lot of people don't trust Bitcoin because it's so volatile, but that's okay. There is no corporation that's going to lose anything because of this.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:03:48
I would say that it either helps or doesn't hurt. The usual argument is that hoarding will lead to a rapid sell-off and the value will plummet to zero. Normally this would be true, but Bitcoin is so damn fluid that I don't see hoarding as being nearly as big a problem as people make it out to be.
Hoarding gold is easy coz it's a bitch to spend on a new smartphone or take with you on an airplane. Bitcoin on the other hand is right there when you need it. 
Also by letting them sit the value goes up enough to expand the "market cap" which in turn allows for larger transactions that can be supported by the more robust value. Granted it's all sorta fake in that it's relying on value generated by speculation, but as I said it'll never be more than is prudent or reasonable because Bitcoin is Roadrunner of currencies. It gets around.
Just look at this most recent dip in price. The market is already correcting itself, and will continue to do so. 
To me it's a bit like worrying about a stagnant ocean of water, except water is well, water, it's not concrete or dirt. It's liquid and it flows, evaporates, mixes, rains down. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:36:11
Well said.
And more to the point, it will enable financial transactions where really none existed in the first place. You can monetize just about anything with Bitcoin. At first this sounds scary, imagine virtual tole booths to streamline traffic patterns, but that's just a mundane example of the kinds of innovations that are possible with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:49:09
This is the crux of value growth (is that a real term?).
As far as I can reason BTC will grow, but only steadily, never too fast. A huge jump in value would precipitate a sell off which would bring the value back down again. There are no short cuts. The over-all economy has to grow, and Bitcoin will only ever be as valuable as the economy is big.

You don't have to worry about losing your private key. Just remember the passphrase.
A lot of people think this is a bad idea because often a person will create an easily guessed passphrase and will have their BTC stolen. I wouldn't recommend passphrases to a beginner who doesn't understand how entropy and probability works. But if you do have a good grasp on what is truly secure and what isn't then passphrases are fine. 
Everyone will disagree with me, but math is math. The tricky part is not doing something stupid like using a line from a poem (sorry). If you do it would be infinitely more secure to do it like this:
smewheRe I haVe nevEr travellEd gladLy bbeyNd aNy experienCe
In this instance I capitalized the second to last letter of each word, removed all the O's and doubled every instance of B.
You could also add stuff like you date of birth or whatever else. Create a system and stick to it. Write down your passphrase, but NEVER your method.

Even though I think Bitcoin is already revolutionary and worthy of attention I'd be much happier if money were being put into projects that exploit and explore its potential.
If you build it they will come. There will be no need for billboards and all that stuff. The problem (being worked on as we speak by coders everywhere) is that right now Bitcoin is primarily used as a speculative investment and occasional currency. It should be a whole lot more. I'm confident that it will be.
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:44:00

Though I think Bitcoin itself will go up for other reasons as well. The dropping value of the dollar being one of them.

No. But you would have to write out the dialogue anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:40:57
That sounds pretty safe. But just ask yourself: what's the worst case scenario and could I survive that?"
Me, I use a brainwallet, but I know how to create strong passphrases. Worst case scenario, I get brain dammage and forget, or I die. In both cases losing my BTC is trivial in comparison, and I'll have bigger stuff to worry about at that point, like being a vegetable or being dead (wouldn't matter at all then).
If my BTC is valued at 10's of thousands of dollars some day I will have to take measures to make sure it's passed on to loved ones, but that's a bridge I'll cross when I come to it.
Now in your case, is it possible that something could happen to your computer that might destroy that bitcoin forever? Or could you get a new computer, put in a passphrase and get it all back? If not you might want to look at other options.
@_date: 2013-10-07 22:40:51

I can afford to lose $20.00 a week or so if the possible reward is much greater.
I also believe in Bitcoin's potential for various reasons I won't bore you with. I don't gamble, ever. Basically I think Bitcoin IS a sound financial decision. I realize you probably strongly disagree with me, but that's how I see it. So I'm approaching all of this in the wisest way to my mind.
Had I been asked 2 years ago to invest in Bitcoin I would have said no, because it's too risky and it'll probably never work. But time has shown it is working. It's hard to gauge something that is without precedent, but things have changed a lot in just the past 6 months. It seems there is something unique and world changing that is underway.
Could be wrong of course. But I'll take that risk. It's a personal choice.

I just meant that since everyone seems to value bitcoin at its current price then that must be the correct value. In other words empirical data shows us how the value has increased over a given amount of time, but if you look at the bubbles you get a very different picture. But bubbles are temporary and eventually "self-correct". What you're left with afterward is the "real" value more or less.
I'm not saying that Bitcoin shouldn't be valued much more than it is, but apparently not enough other people agree, and so we've all settled on $140-ish at present time.

Coinbase is good for buying and selling BTC, NOT for making everyday transactions.

So yeah, it could be better, but that big ass number up there really says it all if you have some from of reference.
For example: a piece of paper folded 200 time (if it were large enough to fold so many times) would be as thick as the observable known universe.

You point out something important, which is that an attacker can ONLY attack the entire space. There's no way of knowing if a particular address is derived from a passphrase or not. SHA256 doesn't work that way. So I agree with that point.
However, in order for a hacker to miss my weak wallet they would have to assume that no one has ever created one that is so vulnerable. That's a pretty big assumption, and an incorrect one. I know that weak wallets get swiped all the time. Ask btcrobinhood.
You say my mangling is specific to me, and I guess it is, but that goes for anyone else who takes 10 seconds to come up with something.
If it becomes common for people to employ techniques that they read on some website then yeah, that's dumb. But that's not what I'm talking about. I realize the potential for carelessness, but the only point that I continually try to make is that it's not that difficult to create strong passphrases if you're a little creative.
I went to that website for testing passwords and typed in 10 random letters. It said that it would take 9 hours for a standard pc to crack, so I would imagine that it would take a bad-ass rig a lot less time. My guess is that it would be such a short amount of time that it could be breezed through and swiped in minutes. So maybe it's true that hackers just aren't even putting in the effort.

I disagree. I'm invested in BTC and I have all kinds of debt. 
The thing is, I'd have that debt even if I had never heard of Bitcoin. So what's the difference? I could pay off most of it, if not all of it, but hey, I've lived my whole adult life with bills and loans. I'm used to it; bring it on. 
I'm holding.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:07:55
Here's the trick: Don't sell. Just buy.
Only sell if you're paying for something else as in a good or service, which I think is fine because that's kinda the whole point of Bitcoin.
But yeah, I'm holding onto mine, but when I absolutely need it, I'll use it.
This happened a few weeks ago when I had to move to a new place and needed first and last month's rent, plus a security deposit, plus all the other costs that go into moving. I sold only as much as I had to. The beauty of it is that I only ever put maybe $800.00 into Bitcoin since I started buying, and I've already cashed out $1,300.00 for expenses, and I still have the majority of my investment.
So even if Bitcoin goes to ZERO tomorrow, I've already gotten a practical ROI that went towards my not being homeless.
@_date: 2013-10-09 06:05:11
I don't believe Coinbase is a true exchange. I could be wrong, but coinbase simply allows you to buy and sell bitcoin at "their" rate. You trade like on other exchanges.

It has to be normal because we're talking about how people transact value and make their living through earning this currency. When whole economies and people's financial well-being are at stake, there will be no voluntary fucking around.
It's one thing for the government to fuck you over, but for people to say "yeah, I'd like to pour the value of the work I do into something that could plummet in value at any moment", it just seems unlikely.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:32:29
Not sure what you're implying, but the Streisand effect may play a huge role here.
I wouldn't be surprised if ANY kind of attention from the government causes a spike in value. Bitcoin is the kind of thing that a lot of people are looking for, but just don't know about yet. And I would have to agree with Throwahoymatie that government condemnation makes it all the more attractive.
It certainly perks up my ears.

@_date: 2013-10-17 16:46:08
What it REALLY comes down to is wider adoption. Insofar as the above reasons promote it we will see a greater value.
If however it's more or less the same number of users shuffling BTC around on exchanges then no, there will be no increase. Indeed if growth grinds to a halt then the value will drop as well.

You say they don't need to know until it happens, but THEY are the ones who will make it happen. Bitcoin enthusiasts don't live in a vacuum. In fact a decent percentage of the current BTC value is speculation on our part that THEY will adopt it too.
This is an economy/market that I think will grow very organically because it has to. It'll be a slow and steady march to global mindshare as more of THEM take part in the BTC economy.

I won't make a judgement on whether it's a wise investment ( I don't give financial advice). Personally I'm bullish on Bitcoin, but I've only invested a relatively small amount. I'm also more or less broke, so it's not like I have the ability. I only hope you're prepared to lose that 20k. I don't think you will, but still...
At any rate I would buy in increments over a few weeks, just to be sure nothing goes wrong with a single BIG transaction. You never know in the Bitcoin space. It's still early days.
Once you have the BTC. I HIGHLY recommend offline storage. Create a rock-solid passphrase and generate several wallets based on it.
and so on.
Keep the passphrase in a secure place with the proper protocols necessary if you die and want it left to a loved-one. Maybe a safety deposit box.
NEVER write down the private key (no need).
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:43:47
That's true. I think there's a huge Streisand effect inherent in BTC. 
Indeed I think that the reason Bitcoin hasn't experienced nearly as much blow back and we think it will is because the Government, Mastercard, BoA, all those guys know damn well if they even bring their name into the same sentence as Bitcoin, it's over....

First learn how it works. Understand what a private key is and how you must keep it secret, and not lose it. If you do, you're S.O.L.

I have no idea how many have been lost so far, it's not really possible to know, but my guess is that the number is already a couple 100,000. 
Also I believe Satoshi Nakamoto is sitting on something like 10% of all BTC, and who knows if those coins will ever move.

I've been buying small amounts of BTC for months now, and I gotta say that I'm glad I did. If I need USD I just use Coinbase, and I get more out than I put in. 
That could change of course, but it's a risk that I'm willing to take. So far it's worked out nicely.
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:45:38
Every address is vulnerable, yes. But the bots don't "march up and down the blockchain challenging addresses". You have to understand that there's nothing to challenge except for the possibility that ANY address has BTC.
In other words there's no way of knowing if the most recent block has an address derived from a weak passphrase, not until after the fact when it's cracked. The encryption algorithm is a "one way" process. You can't infer what the passphrase to an address is by looking at it.
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:22:58

Well, completionacknowledged was cracked in seconds, so I'm not convinced that ANY pair or three letter passphrase is secure. It's probably just within computational possibility to monitor all possible combos in the english language of two and maybe three word long passphrases.
I also wouldn't trust "to picke or not to be". I'm sure it would stand up to being swiped for a while, but these days it could happen faster than you think, and BAM it's gone. After all "to be or not to be" is a well known phrase, so it would make sense to add variations on this.

But there's always local bitcoins and so on.

Well, that was my question. I'm not familiar with that rule of humanity, but I think that it DOES apply perfectly to currency or commodities in general.
So I agree with you. I don't know if it'll be $650.00 or 5 grand, but the market will have to correct itself.
P.S. I don't think BTC will be worthless, just that it'll take a lot longer than we think for the value to go up as much as we'd like. 
After all there's 1,000's of us who would love to be filthy rich, and that's what's going to keep the value of BTC relatively low for a goodish long time. We have to wait for all the heavy spending of the new-found wealth before BTC becomes realistically stable enough for truly mass adoption.
Think about a whole lot of people just took Bitcoin seriously as of a few days ago as a result of the ATM story. If that number of people were enough to drive the price up to 1,000 dollars, then wouldn't a SHIT TON of people spend it or put back on the exchange?

There is no such thing as "western medicine". There is only "medicine".
There is such a thing as the placebo effect.
And after a thousand years of practice it still isn't accepted as legit medicine, not to mention that even the chinese are leaving it in droves for what you call "western medicine" because it works. Recently it's only poorer people who use acupuncture.
But there is a chance a needle in the eye stops it twitching. That actually kinda makes sense.

I would say that after a year or two the other passphrases would have likely to be taken as well.

I just recently had a problem (partially my fault) with Coinbase. I purchased 2 Bitcoins which I received instantly as always, but Coinbase took its time charging my bank account. A whole week went by, by which time my bank automatically withdrew a payment for a car loan that wasn't supposed to transfer for another couple days. I changed to payment date, but they (NFCU) still charged me early. Anyway once Coinbase got around to charging my account there were insufficient funds.
Now I realize I should have had the funds in place until payment finally cleared, but still, why does Coinbase wait upwards of a week to charge me for a purchase? It doesn't seem safe from their point of view. You would think they would want the USD in their accounts before ever letting go of a couple thousand dollars.
Sorry about ranting so much. So now I have sent an email asking what to do. I still have the BTC that I was never charged for because of the bounce back of insufficient funds. I'll gladly return the BTC or pay what is owed. So far no response form anyone there. 
Meanwhile my instant purchase ability has been canceled. It says I don't have a verified credit card. I did have one, but they've deleted it apparently.
Oh such hassle. And all I want to do is buy Bitcoin in a timely fashion, AND PAY FOR IT at the same instant.

As for myself, Bitcoin has sent me down a long road of economic fundamentals. Before Bitcoin I didn't know or care that much about how the economy works. Now I take note every time I see an article about QE and all that stuff.

Oh, well never mind. 
I thought it was published within the blockchain since I recall the message "this will be permanent public record" or something like that. But really it's not permanent then is it? Only as long as blockchain.info is up and running. Well that blows.
But now I'm thinking that a decentralized ledger of website-type information would be useful. Certainly easier than having to use TOR and all that mess.
After all how could the government shut down Silk Road if it existed on 100,000 computers across the world? I supposed that's the essence of current p2p networks, but can you "share" websites like you do files?

The key word is "charge back", not reversal of charges which, yes, would not be possible, no more possible than ungiving someone money. Instead they would give it BACK. This seems to be a system that streamlines that protocol with an abstraction layer of protocol on top of the bitcoin one. I think...

True, but the OP didn't say that. If so, then a little more info on the specific area of the BTC economy would be helpful.

You're already looking better than me, sorta.
Your problems happening all at once like that suck (was it all related somehow).
Me I gotta be out of my current place in a week, and if I want to keep my job I need to find a place in town. And this is proving to be more difficult than I had thought.
Also the extra cash I'll need for rent/deposit/all that shit will most likely come out of my BTC savings. I had plans on keeping it for years.  Life and all its curve balls can go f**k itself.
Anyway, glad you're doing better.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:41:49
I agree. Until there is a better convention for sending to frequent addresses I don't think first bits is safe, at least not for sending BTC. Maybe for looking up an address, but not sending to one.
Maybe they should create a feature where you can label addresses. Or does this already exist?
First Bits, NO.

The question is, who are the other peers? 
What are the details of the methodology? I can tell you now it's not blinded and certainly not double blinded. It says so in the abstract.
Has this study been independently replicated with similar results (not that it should be as the methodology may be flawed).
Bottom line is, no one disputes well established medicine that yields positive results time after time, and has been studied up the wazoo. But when a particular treatment is "tested" by an organization who has a vested interest in seeing it validated I have to be suspicious.
"Medicine" is not a specific treatment, acupuncture is.
And as you say, it's the only study. That right there means it's not a complete one.
@_date: 2013-09-15 05:34:08
There's really no need to store anywhere other than in your head. You don't need electrum. Just use brainwallet.org.
What I do is memorize a long enough phrase and just tack on another word or number at the end. It's much easier than memorizing 12 random words.
For example I might choose " somewhere i have never traveled gladly beyond /1" , the first line of an ee cummings poem. And of course you can create tons of addresses just by changing the number 2, 3, 4, etc...
You could argue that this might be cracked, but in reality the chances are slim. Also it's just a crappy example. You can think of something a little more unique.
Hope that helps.
But as already stated, the issue of being hit by a bus is problematic. If you want to pass on the BTC to a family member or friend you might want to store the passphrase on a piece of paper in a safe deposit box.

I want to know when they plan on lowering their minimum buy amount.
As of right now the least you can buy on Coinbase will cost you about $31.00. If the value continues to go up at this rate no one will be able to buy any except for the wealthier among us.
I miss being able to throw $10.00 here and $12.00 there. It seems that pretty soon I'm gonna have to save up for weeks just to buy my 0.10 BTC, if I can even keep up with it, that is.
@_date: 2013-10-23 04:57:18
considering how steep the climb in value has been I would buy BTC and pull out of MT. Gox. From there I could go to Bitstamp or one of the better exchanges.
That said, you have a good point.
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:15:14
In this case I would recommend writing down the passphrase on paper (paper wallet).
CAUTION! If you're gonna use a passphrase, make sure it's secure. If you don't know what a secure passphrase is then you either need to learn or not use it at all.
Someone recently used a line from an obscure poem as a passphrase and it was stolen, not good enough.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:28:22
Once you've bought it, put in cold storage, keep that piece of paper in a safe place. 
And leave it there.
P.S. Just in case you don't know. You can send more BTC to that same paper wallet.
DON'T USE ONLINE WALLETS!

That doesn't sound like an economy that will actually work in a reliable sustainable way. But rather one where several hundred thousand people routinely throw massive wrenches into the economy by spending a Bitcoin here and there.
It just doesn't seem like it could work.

@_date: 2013-07-29 06:19:12
Well, seeing how popular Satoshi dice is I would have expected tens of thousands of transactions per hour. Also like I said, you can watch transactions roll by on blockchain.info. I've never counted them, but it sure does look like they're flying by at more than just a few thousand per hour. Maybe not though.
@_date: 2013-06-17 15:41:59
So this would require a fairly strict standardization of what the transaction fee will be. After all the customer doesn't HAVE to pay a transaction fee, though getting a confirmation would be very hard which the vendor wouldn't like. 
It would seem there would need to be some meta system or protocol in place to make sure that millions of transactions per day all follow the same fee rate and so forth in order to streamline the process.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:30:46
Write that one down. 
It's pithy.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:39:12
Correct. Just remember to store the private key somewhere safe or your BTC is gone forever, i.e. stuck at that address forever. You can send as much to that same address as you want.
But once you import the private key into a Bitcoin client (online or something that runs on your computer) you will then have to send the remainder to a new address.
I use the Electrum wallet. It's probably the best there is out there.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:21:47
I'm tempted to find out. I wanna buy a little, but I really shouldn't be spending any money (or rather converting any). I need to pay rent and all.
And I have a rule of not selling my BTC, especially since I'm not on any exchange, and frequent back and forth on Coinbase apparently will get you flagged for all sorts of shit, if not by them then at least by your bank. And I don't want to take that risk.

This is true. But I would recommend it to someone who understands what a strong passphrase is. But there's no way of knowing that. 
Basically Brainwallets are awesome if you know what you're doing, and they're awful if you don't.
Perhaps if Bitcoin becomes popular among the general public there will be a "raising of consciousness" among people as to what a strong passphrase - or password - is. 
It's not that people are stupid, just that they don't fully understand what the probabilities are. These days hardly anyone leaves home without locking their door. We just need the internet version of that kind of awareness.

I think that's all true. I guess my point is just that it might be a while before Bitcoin gains any astronomical value BECAUSE of how valuable it will become.
The real factor here is TIME. More specifically steady/rocky growth over a lengthy period of time. One way or another the Bitcoin economy will HAVE to grow gradually. I can't see how it will suddenly burst forth.
Granted that's exactly what happened for those who bought BTC back in 2009.

I totally agree that Bitcoin needs a handful of abstraction layers to make it more usable and palatable to a general public.
But in the long run I don't think it'll be that hard to understand. It's just different, not complicated. Our current banking system is a THOUSAND times more complicated. Bitcoin by comparison is fischer price.

I would NEVER advise doing this. I just like performing the experiments. 
But just for clarification lets take the word "installing" as our example. I believe the possibilities for this one word (or any other are) 25x10 which is 250, now multiply this times the number of 10 letter words in english, and that should be the number of possibilities.
That sum is relatively small and could easily be hacked. But now lets take this word and add to a list of 4 other words, correctly spelled, and work out the possible combinations. Actually I'm too lazy to try, but it's big. That's for damn sure. You're using your normal set of all possible 4 word combinations multiplied by all possible 10 letter words multiplied by 250.
And this is still way easier than what I would (and do) use.

I'm glad you're transaction went through though. This is ridiculous. I've also tried a number of other sites as an alternative, but they're all down for one reason or another.
Given all that I'm guessing that the reason why the value of bitcoin has been declining these past few days is because no one can actually buy any.
@_date: 2013-10-05 04:59:39
I can't believe that there's NO ONE who's working on a client with all these features. It boggles my mind. 
So many tech savvy Bitcoin enthusiasts and not a one seems to give a crap about enabling all the things that will make bitcoin truly usable. I must be missing something.
Maybe it's that this type of software would have to be opensource and free, and well, dev's gotta get paid too. But if they own any bitcoin you'd think it would be in their interest make this a priority.
Either all that stuff I just said, or coding for these features is FREAKISHLY hard to do. Like quantum mechanics or something.
Whatever. I love bitcoin myself. I just get angry when I hear talk about how big it's gonna be, but no one mentions the layers of GUI and such that will be necessary to do it.

Yes, but the scary part is when they decide to sell it all off. Imagine if BTC were the dominant currency of the world, and we had savings in it, received our paychecks in it, payed for groceries with it.

I completely agree that entropy depends on the method used. That's one of the points I like to make.
However I would say that this method is more than sound.
My offer still stands, if you can name that dialogue you get 0.5 BTC. 
I think there's a lot of what skeptics and scientists call pareidolia with respect to passphrases or entropy more generally. You see patterns where there are none, and infer a genuine passphrases hackability based solely on the fact that it's a passphrase.
If I gave you a passphrase such as fghtrecfiru7vuhi you might say that's a STRONG passphrase, and you'd be absolutely correct. I just typed that out randomly.
However if I took a few minutes to make something of it (find a pattern where one doesn't exist) then you'd say that it's not very strong.
The truth is passphrase attackers can only realistically account for so many methods and iterations. If they weren't limited in this way then even truly random passphrases or just plain old random keys wouldn't be sufficient. 
The divide between randomness and patterns ALWAYS breaks down if you look hard enough and make shit up. But from the POV of math it doesn't.

You're talking about blockchain.info. The blockchain itself is decentralized. I have a copy as do many 1,000's of people around the world. The blockchain.info website is nothing more than a website/wallet service. It's not important unless you're using it as you're only wallet service (and there's already dozens out there).
Also blockchain.info is not a bank. The guys who run the site don't have access to any of your information. The wallet is generated locally within the browser. They simply act as a relay.
It's like saying " is centralizing the internet". No, it isn't....

You can hoard if you want, and hopefully be rewarded, but if everyone does it then bitcoin is worthless even if it's worth $500,000 per coin because no one is spending it. What's the point in having currency at all if no one uses it?

I'm not sure what you mean.
If you're saying my passphrase isn't secure, I'd like to see you try and crack it. My BTC is still there and it ain't going anywhere without some alien overlord computing power. And it's not that hard to remember.
I get the feeling that a lot of people are... well, not very imaginative when it comes to brainwallets. I mean how FUCKING hard is it to remember a unique phrase of some sort. Even with random numbers and letters thrown in, those numbers and letters can mean something to you. BE CREATIVE! 
I think if we were all 7 years old we'd have this down without a problem. Kids are much better with their imaginations. As far as I can tell the average adult creates passphrases by stringing together random words that don't mean anything even to them. 
But maybe I'm unique in that regard. I've been a life-long lover of language (and alliteration), so I'm pretty good at playing with words/meaning/morphemes/ciphers and the like.

@_date: 2013-10-05 16:45:05
Not because I want to, but how does one attach a public note to a transaction? Is it something that only exists within the blockchain.info site? Or can I read it if I dive into my bitcoin-qt client?
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:29:17
They don't know what to look for. All anyone can do is guess. So a hacker would use specific software that generates hashes of various word combinations and common phrases (lines of poetry and so on), and then see which addresses contain Bitcoin.
Because the hashing function is ONE WAY there is no way of knowing if a public address or private key were derived from a passphrase. All you can do is check every passphrase you can generate with a powerful enough computer.
Basically, the best a hacker can do to crack a brainwallet/passphrase generated wallet is to make millions of random guesses and see if any of them hit money.
For you to be safe with a brainwallet you have to create a passphrase that no one will ever think of, or generate with software. This means it has to be long and random. I would use a system where, for example, I change all the E's in my passphrase to 6's, or something along those lines. Chances are close to nill that anyone will take into account a passphrase like: this is only a s6curity t6st of wall6ts.

At any rate those idiots definitely do not remain with more money in their pockets. They remain with roughly the same amount they started with. Maybe calling them idiots is harsh. They're not stupid. They're prudent and wise, and have no business messing with bitcoins in the first place (which is where the idiot part does come in).
Bitcoin is and will remain very volatile. But two weeks or two months just isn't a long time. I'd rather wait another two years and then we'll assess the game.
But I'm dodging the main issue which is that one shouldn't speculate on bitcoin. That's not really what it's for and you'll get bitten if you try it.

First of all; GET 'EM WHILE THEIR CHEAP. It won't last that long.
And secondly, I'd rather the government not have that much of the life-blood of our future economy. That is sketchy to say the least.
It's one thing if the gov sells off the BTC and the price drops to $15, but quite another when BTC is valued at, say, $10,000 because it's the medium of exchange and store of wealth for billions of people. A rapid sell-off, or even slow one could have severe consequences.
The problem (among others) is that the government didn't "earn" that money that might one day be worth so much more.
Let me put it another way: if the gov seized a hundred million dollars from someone, big deal. That money will be worth less in 10 years, and it's not a lot in the grand scheme of things.
However a hundred thousand BTC in the hands of a gov't that may do FUCK KNOWS WHAT with them at any time in the future, that's terrifying.

Back in April for a minute Bitcoin was selling for upwards of $200.00. So some sellers put in an order to sell at, say, $170.00 if anyone were willing to pay that price. Well Bitcoin hasn't been valued that high in a long time, so the seller's offer has never been taken; obviously you can buy Bitcoin for less. 
But NOW the price of BTC is inching back up into that ballpark, so anyone who STILL has that offer on the books will soon have their request fulfilled.
Get it? 
Or were you being sarcastic? :-)
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:12:49
You make a good point. I've made some intentionally bad passphrases that haven't been hacked. I've been told it's because there isn't enough BTC in them.
I suppose it could be that the passphrase was discovered and the hacker is deciding to wait and see if any more money goes in. But I HIGHLY doubt this. I've had other passphrases hacked with very small amounts and they were swiped within seconds of hitting the blockchain.
Here's one that was just recently swiped after 15 days. 
P.S. I gave hints and everything and it's only a 10 letter passphrase with one letter changed.
@_date: 2013-09-29 21:11:13
A brainwallet is a term that means an address created from a passphrase.
A brainwallet is an option. It's not something that all addresses are created from.
Most of the time a brain wallet is only used for long-term offline storage. In other words NOT in you wallet.dat file. However you could create an address derived from a passphrase (brainwallet) and then import the private key into your Bitcoin-qt client. But this is kind of defeats the purpose of a brainwallet. Why use a brainwallet which is meant for cold-storage if you're gonna just put it back into play, thus creating a chance it might be stolen by malicious software. Also your wallet.dat file is what your Bitcoin client uses. The client creates lots of other addresses on the fly, and your brainwallet address would only be one of many that may or may not be used.

You said there are 2^96 possible keys for each address. So every address that is possible definitely has 2^96 keys that correspond to it even though we could never feasibly know what they are, right?
So the question I pose is: Say I give you an address and I ask "what are the odds you can guess (any) of the private keys that will give you access to the BTC?"
What would those odds be?
The answer is 2^160, right?

I know these transactions were intentional.
Indeed Mom and Dad aren't writing raw transactions. YET!
If I gave my Mom access to my Bitcoin client with a substantial amount, I wouldn't be surprised if she mucked something up. Of course by the time the average Joe is using Bitcoin in large numbers there will hopefully be some slick new software to make the process easy. But there is bound to be mistakes.
Right now it's only us - and we should know better - who occasionally do something stupid. If enthusiastic early adopters can't always get it right I'm guessing new users will have no hope. And it won't do Bitcoin any favors when people are losing money left and right because of lost keys and oversized tx fees. Keep in mind when I say "left and right" I mean 1 out of every 100,000 transactions which would still be a large amount if Bitcoin started gaining massive penetration. 
In other words there will be this clumsy transition period (it's inevitable) where lots of people are using something they don't fully know how to use. It happened with the internet back in the day. It'll happen here to.
Anyway I'm rambling.

Speaking of Coinbase, do you think that they will lower their minimum buy amount as the value goes up.
Right now it's 0.10 BTC, but when that amount costs twice as much as it did a few weeks ago, shouldn't they lower that minimum??
What if a year from now a single bitcoin goes for $600. Does that mean I have to spend a minimum of $60 to make a purchase?
@_date: 2013-10-19 04:45:16
I'm guessing no one accepts MT Gox prices. On Mt. Gox your dollars are worth less, and you want to spend in Bitcoin so it's not in anyone's interest to accept a rate that reflects as being worth less than what you get in dollars. 
In other words, buy this widget for $100.00 OR buy it for $70.00 worth of Bitcoin. Why would anyone do that?
Mt. Gox does NOT reflect true value. Why ANYBODY pays any attention to it baffles me. That exchange rate only exists for people who use Mt Gox and CAN'T get their cash out, so what use is it?
I can start an exchange that values BTC at 10,000 dollars, but just one catch: you can't get your USD out, so who cares. That's Mt. Gox.

The passphrase doesn't enter the block chain. The address that was created from it enters the block chain. And only then when there is an actual transaction. You can't add an address with 0 btc to the block chain. 
The brain wallet is discovered when the hacker tries a particular passphrase and lo and behold there's btc at the address that was created from said passphrase. 
There's no point in searching the block chain for anything. Only trying out pass phrases whose addresses have btc in them. You only use the block chain to verify that the address has the btc.

I see what you mean, but presumably anyone willing to develop for Mastercoin would already have BTC, and the more useful the BTC ecosystem becomes the more the value will go up. 
It seems a little like short-term thinking to want to create a currency and thus value from a unique product rather than "investing" in the Bitcoin ecosystem by way of making it more useful and eventually more valuable.
To use an analogy, if I owned land on top of a massive oil field with millions of barrels of crude it would be in my interest to put money into designing the best oil extraction technology and then giving it away, open-sourcing the design and so forth. The last thing I'd want to do is charge top-dollar for one of my rigs. That's not where the real money is.

Coinbase seems pretty professional. I'm hoping that if I'm proactive and work with them to correct the issue (give them the USD or BTC that is due) then they will work with me in getting my instant buy back. As it is the amount that is due to them is sitting in my Coinbase account. They can take it whenever they want. So far they haven't. I'm assuming they just haven't gotten around to it because they are in the hole $700.00 with respect to my purchase.

The sample is indeed small. But I highly doubt that it's chance that two words such as "perfume invisible" were hacked instantly, but "threaded claRity" wasn't. My guess is that it's the capital letter. This makes sense. After all one would have to run all possible combinations of two or three words AS WELL as all capitalizing combinations. This would be exceedingly hard to do.
Shuffles39 wasn't taken. Of course this is a weak passphrase. But think about it. To find it one would have to check an address generated by every word in the english language in combination with every number between - lets say - 1 - 1000. In some sense it's a lot stronger than you think, but not really in the long run.

Maybe I don't understand because it seems like a large number to me.
In this example, knowing it's a 10 letter word in english, if I got a list of all 10 letter words in english, and then replaced every letter in every word with the other 25 possible letters, would that not be a rather large number?
Keep in mind this is MEANT to be easy to crack. I would never suggest one word with one letter changed. I'm just saying it works out to be a lot of possible addresses.
Hell even if you knew which letter was being replaced, it still might take a while.

Does anyone else think that at some point in the future - for the sake of average users unintentionally doing this - that the protocol should be modified in some way so as to allow a maximum fee? Perhaps a percentage of the total sent?
So if I send 1 BTC I would only be able to include a fee of .01 at most. If I'm sending 100 BTC, maybe 1 whole BTC at most. Would this be a good idea or not?

Well, never mind the denomination or terminology. 
What I'm asking is if someone who owns, say, 5 BTC right now going to have the purchasing power of a millionaire in 10 years or so? Or rather I'm wondering if this would ever be possible given how concentrated and lopsided the market is right now.
The only tenable economy for bitcoin in the future would be one where most of the hoarding has since been spent along the way (which I'm sure will happen anyway). 
I'M JUST SAYIN', If the Winklevii own 1% of the market now, and Bitcoin becomes huge, then they will have between the two of them more money than Steve Jobs+Bill Gates+Warren Buffett+Oprah+whoeverthefuckelse combined. Does that seem normal to anyone?

I'm already verified and I've made a purchase of bitcoins. Its just that the status of the transaction shows as awaiting payment which isn't true since I paid with Google wallet immediately. 
Google wallet shows the transaction as pending but that's because it has to be accepted on btcquick's side before it's final. And so far I've heard nothing from them.
@_date: 2013-10-07 03:10:39
To a much MUCH smaller degree I see this as what's happening to bitcoins themselves.
We think we're saving/hoarding money - and we are - but it's much more than that. What we're really doing, though I suspect it will be some time before it becomes relevant, is squatting on top of precious Bitcoins that will be abstracted à la Colorcoin for use in all manner of stuff.
I think that Bitcoin truly is valuable in this regard, much more than people give it credit for, maybe because they don't see its potential. So yeah, it's kinda like we're trading Domain names as a currency, but eventually people are going to want to attach websites to them, or in the case of bitcoin some form of decentralized verification of ownership. 
THAT is what this is all about.  Sorry for the ramble.

Oh, yes it can.

If I crack a wallet that is "orders of magnitude" more difficult to find, and let's say it has 2 BTC, do I wait and see if the owner adds more, or do I take right there and then because the next attacker will most likely get to it and take it. Or can I be reasonably certain no one else will find what I've found?

You'd have to withdraw at the Mt. Gox price which is quite a bit higher than any other exchange for USD. So you'd get less bit for you buck.

Could be. If they decide to suddenly spend it all. I'm not saying they will, but the possibility is a looming threat for people who might be investing real money in the currency in the not so far-off future.
For now, WE would love to see it happen. It would be a great opportunity to buy. But when Bitcoin becomes a larger part of the economy it could be quite harmful to a lot of businesses and people to be so volatile.
I don't even want to think about a 500 billion dollar economy where Satoshi does... well... god-knows-what will his share of BTC. One can only hope he will one day reappear and donate all of it to worthy causes. That would awesome.
As the economy grows the volatility will subside, but Satoshi will always own a SHIT-TON of Bitcoin, and that's all we can know for sure. What will become of it? No one knows. What a pleasant, reassuring thought.

Day trading is not advised.
Paper wallets are highly recommended.
A paper wallet is just a term used to describe a private key/public address pair in which the private key has NEVER TOUCHED the internet. In other words you created the pair offline for all intents and purposes. Since the private key has never been used/transmitted it would be all but impossible for the Bitcoin to be stolen.
A trusted site is  To be safe you can go to the site then turn off your internet; the application runs locally within the browser so no internet is needed. From there you can print out the paper wallet (hence the "paper" part), and keep it somewhere safe.
I use brainwallets which is basically the same principle, but brainwallets are not recommended unless you know what you're doing.

It seems to me that whenever there is rapid change in price (like today) Coinbase hedges the volatility by creating a larger buffer between the going rate and what THEY will charge.

What do you mean by "clever schemes"? Are you referring to my ideas on generating entropy? Because they are by no means limited. Quite the opposite. 
I could make up around a 100 off the top of my head right now. It's not that hard.
How about a passphrase with the addition of, say, adding 10 spaces before beginning it, and removing all vowels?
I have less secure ideas than that being tested with just one word, and it's still there. Just saying. 
Math don't lie. Run the numbers and you'll see that we're talking about addresses in the 1.3x10^19 just for all the possibilities of one word, in english, 10 letters long, and 1 letter changed.

Think about it. A BUNCH of chinese are making money playing this market. And just like anyone they'll cash out when the price is right. The important thing is that new people take an interest in the market. This is what leads to real growth.
If Bitcoin soared to $400.00 in the next 24 hours I SERIOUSLY doubt everyone would just hold on to their BTC and wait for it to go higher. That ain't how it works. The price would plummit back down within hours, but hopefully just above where it left off before the bubble. (not saying this is a bubble BTW).

I don't think a 51% attack will ever happen, because that would compromise the network, which would devalue the coins down to almost nothing, in which case why bother doing it. 
All miners have a vested interest in NOT gaining 51% of the network. And for the government to do it on its own is well beyond the realm of possibility. Let's just say it would cost many hundreds of millions of dollars and it would be no small project. Word would get out within days and it would be front page news. Not to mention a SERIOUS waste of tax payer money.

Well, I was never able to either except for yesterday. 
Maybe it was a fluke.
At some point they have to change their minimum amount. If BTC goes up to $500 (that'd be nice) then fewer people would be able to afford even the minimum. That would cost them business, I would think.

@_date: 2013-11-09 06:46:08
Exactly. People like Gavin and other core devs are the real hope for this new economy.
If all work on improving the Bitcoin Space stopped today I'm sure this would all come to a grinding halt eventually. But luckily there are very smart people figuring out how to actually make this worth something. And they do it by making it better at storing and transmitting that which we assign worthiness too.
It's a strange kind of tautology, but it makes sense. Bitcoin is the essence of bootstrapping if nothing else. This is not a flaw, it's a strength.
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:24:03
So you know of compromised wallets that haven't been swiped?
If so I can only guess it's because whoever cracked the passphrase is the only one so far and is deciding to wait based on the amount in the wallet. Because there are others out there. Do hackers all know each other and coordinate their efforts or something? 
I don't think I could create a weak wallet that wouldn't be swiped within seconds. I've tried this multiple times. Every time with about 0.01 BTC. Perhaps that's too high. If it were less than the necessary tx fee, then yeah. But otherwise it'll get taken. There are just too many competing bots out there.

Thanks for the links. Very interesting stuff.
An even crazier idea is storing data that is itself decentralized on the blockchain, in other words, a couple hundred thousand addresses that when combined and interpolated by a blockchain browser render a complete website.
Maybe even utilize some of the raw data in clever ways, kinda like how compression software works. It's all gobbledygook until it's decompressed. So in this case you'd have to first "find" the info to decompress and point to it. There are so many 1's 0's and abc's in the blockchain I wouldn't be surpised if it were possible to "retro-encode" data in this way.

Are they just spamming the blockchain with tiny transactions?
@_date: 2013-10-07 03:01:55
A certificate authority is a centralized "authority" and is not nearly as secure as the proof of work for verification, so there's no change there. But a CA does make it easier for merchants which is good. I see this as a good thing.
Also it's not as if one HAS to use a CA and all that other stuff. We're using the bare bones architecture right now. So if we wanted to bypass all that fancy stuff we could (and many will), and so again we still need protection from double spending which the protocol already does, and must continue to do no matter what is built on top of it.
@_date: 2013-10-08 03:05:34
I can attest that indeed MANY people on this very subreddit say that people are lazy and stupid and don't know how to take the right precautions in creating passphrases.
At any rate, knowing what is truly secure (enough entropy) is simply a matter of pure mathematics. We don't have to guess or ballpark anything. If you create enough entropy you are secure against all conceivable odds. And it doesn't take much. I even ran a little experiment to see what the minimum entropy could be. Surprisingly phrases like "threaded claRity" will work for a LONG time (never was swiped until I moved it back to my wallet). I've done it. "threaded clarity" however would be swiped in less than 4 seconds by a bot.
So if I did "Samm is a redd reDDit rabitt flying on the 1701 4 fun" , I'd be well beyond secure. I'd bet anything this wouldn't be compromised. It's many orders of magnitude beyond the capabilities of current supercomputers.

Well, they are all week passphrases, but I CAN conclude that certain passphrases were swiped while others were not after a week.
I knew if I posted this someone would say "You should have waited a couple years" etc..... , but that wasn't my goal.
All I know is you'll get your BTC taken in less than a minute if you're passphrase is as week as bookshelfwaterreplay, but you're safe for a week or so if the phrase is typewriter51 or typewRiter. From this small sample you can extrapolate your own conclusions. I plan on doing this again with more passphrases of specific types.

That may be true, but Bitcoin is still VERY useful.
What no one seems to understand, including a lot of Bitcoin fans, is that the real "INTRINSIC" value lies in the Bitcoin protocol. There is SOOO much that can be done with it, and I mean stuff no one has thought of yet.
Even if the value leveled out tomorrow and bitcoin never gained any more value than it has today I guarantee that an increasing amount of people would continue to use it for anything where fiat/banking systems fail.

@_date: 2013-10-26 19:27:01
But just to be clear, the way this works is, in order for that passphrase I posted to be cracked the attacker would have had to generated the address from the passphrase itself, right?
In other words is there a way of generating keys that doesn't involve hashing the passphrase even though you're looking for keys generated from passphrases?
If that's not the case I doubt it would be cracked. It's possible I suppose. But like I keep saying, I got way easier ones than that with small amounts in them, and no one has gotten to them yet.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:57:57

I agree Bitcoin isn't pump and dump. One reason this won't happen is that Bitcoin is limited, and the value will go up so long as there are people who have "faith" in it as a currency. And this is how all currencies work, and Bitcoin deserves more faith than any other.
More importantly - and this is never really mentioned by anyone - Bitcoin, if nothing else is a really good way to store value. Maybe it'll never be a means of exchange. Maybe I'll never be able to buy socks at Target with my bitcoin wallet. But you know what? I can keep money in Bitcoin. And it can't be devalued by a government or anyone. That in itself is worth something. It's a bit of a paradox, but basically it's valuable because it's limited and goes up in value over time. And so people buy it and keep it. 
It would be wrong to call it an IOU, but it is sorta like a UO-ME. I'm probably way off on that last remark. :-P

I'm starting to understand a little how Mastercoin works. One question though: why the need for 4,700 coins? 
If a Mastercoin represents a more robust, feature rich version of Bitcoin why not just transact a mastercoin on top of however much BTC you want to use rather than transacting as a completely separate currency?
I'm not sure that made sense. I'm still trying to get a grasp on how Mastercoin works. I relistened to your interview on Let's Talk Bitcoin to see what I could glean from that. I'll keep trying.

I'll try to find a good link, but in the meantime just know this:
There is NO WAY to single out your public address and challenge IT specifically because the public address offers NOTHING to challenge. It's the private key that you want.
Public addresses are generated FROM the private keys in a way that you can't infer ANYTHING about the private key by knowing the address. So in order to "challenge your address" one would have to go through all the possible private keys that could ever exist and see which one matches your public address. This would take trillions of years.
@_date: 2013-09-22 01:31:38
Yeah, I would like to know HOW they justify that. Maybe there is something going on in the back-end that makes credit cards more difficult, but I can't imagine what that could be.
Seriously, shouldn't it be the other way around. You should have to pay a fee for using a check, not a credit card. The only thing I can guess is that they have to absorb the transaction fee of the credit card, but this would probably not be enough to justify the hassle of dealing with a check these days. 
A CHECK! They PREFER it??

The part you're missing is where the money gets spent. If not there's a lot of really rich people living off food stamps and taking the bus to work at Walmart. I don't know why anyone would want to have money that ends up being useless because they don't spend it. 
Hoarding is one of those mythical concepts that doesn't exist in reality. I haven't done exhaustive research but from what I gather it's more of a made up Bigfoot of economics. 
If people do hoard and never spend then they must be idiots. Effectively they'd be poor and the money would be worthless.

Acquiring Bitcoin is just a teeny bit easier than acquiring gold if I may be so bold.
If Bitcoin does become a mainstay of commodities investment I foresee this company doing badly rather than well. Because everyone is gonna quickly catch on that all you need is a bank account and the ability to save private keys. If you can't do that much yourself then you missing a french fry from your happy meal.

But even in the chart you just posted it shows the transactions varying between 30,000 and 40,000 on average, NOT 1,600 which is about where bitcoinwatch always has it. I never thought it was accurate. So weird.

All the effort than can be made IS being made at this very moment. There is no way for a passphrase hacker to have any idea at all what addresses represent weak or strong passphrases, or if they represent any passphrase at all. That's how the SHA-256 algorithm works.
If no one is trying to proactively hack weak passphrases they're missing out on a lot of potential money. And I'm not naive enough to think they would abstain because of any ethical issues.

The blockchain would make no distinction. If by chance someone else generated the same address then you would both have access to the same wallet and everything in it.
HOWEVER, if it's a truly randomly generated wallet the chances of that happening are beyond astronomical. You could try to accidentally generate an address and key pair that has already been used, but it would take you hundreds of trillions of years, or something in that ballpark.

There a website called btcbalance that lets you monitor public addresses. I use it a lot. But there's a 50 address max per account.
As far as the wallets themselves. I'd pick a really good strong passphrase (emphasis on strong), and simply append it with a /1, /2, /3 and so on. That way you only need to keep track of one passphrase and not hundreds of private keys, which you'd have to have printed somewhere.

And in this regard it is worth more than any fiat currency. But for now most of its value is being maintained through speculation. 
So the price may still drop until we have a true value based on bitcoins use, which if its used by more people will go up in the long run.

You're absolutely right. I agree that security is THE BIGGEST FLIPPING ISSUE that faces Bitcoin.
The way I see it there is going to have to be some kind of layered protocol that makes it more secure and manageable. I don't know what it will be and how it will work. But it's going to have to happen. This is not optional.
Anyone have any ideas?

I'm arguing that it's perfectly okay to save Bitcoin, much as one saves money.
The Bitcoin that I've put aside in cold storage over the past six months has saved my ass when I needed money. Had I just spent it as soon as I bought it, well it wouldn't have been there.

Addressing your last paragraph. The question I have isn't about Bitcoins worth compared to dollars in 20 years. But rather Bitcoin's PURCHASING POWER in 20 years.
I don't care about the comparison to fiat, maybe I shouldn't have even used the term millionaire. My apologies.
Forget dollars, euros, yen, whatever. I just want to know: Is it realistic to expect the several hundred thousand of us who own BTC now to be able to buy yachts and football teams in 20 years?"
That's the question.

Not sure what you mean, but I will say this:
My investment in Bitcoin saved me when I had to be out of my last residence and moved into another within a few weeks. It was that or be homeless. I'd rather be in debt with a roof over my head than without bills but homeless.
I really do take issue with anyone who would tell me to get rid of money I've saved, even if to pay off debt. I live just about paycheck to paycheck. Having a buffer when the shit hits the fan is a good thing.

I love your point about Bitcoin being a protocol. Not many understand this, or rather what it means in the long run.
I recently responded to a criticism with the same point.
The internet has changed DRASTICALLY in the past 20 years, but it still runs on TCP/IP which has been around since the 70's. Bitcoin is that protocol, BTCP if you like. Everyone is arguing over Bitcoin while ignoring what will be built on top of it, a bit like debating the pros and cons of a giant slab of concrete until some guy comes along and builds a skyscraper on it. OHHHH, that's what you can do with it!
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:28:38
Your last paragraph is the most important. There really does need to be safeguards against that sort of thing. Bitcoin's greatest strength is also is greatest weakness at the moment, that it moves like water through a sieve if you're not careful.
I recall one of the hosts of Lets Talk Bitcoin saying that Bitcoin will most likely have its "AOL" day when millions of noobs logged onto the internet for the first time in their lives and everything got clusterfucked. Unfortunately in the case of Bitcoin we're talking about money, not just clumsy nettiquette, so it's a real issue that HAS to be addressed if Bitcoin is to have any chance of being a usable currency.

I'd say that's pretty safe. Mine is similar. I use variations on the same "main passphrase" by adding a word at the end to distinguish one wallet from another. My passphrase is a relatively obscure lyric with some more entropy thrown in PLUS the final word or number which is completey random. Some might say it's not based on the fact that there's a known phrase in it (not well known), but add another twenty random characters and some random capitalization and I think it's pretty solid.

I've made brainwallets with small amounts that HAVE been swiped, and it's an automatic process that takes between 4 and 20 seconds according to blockchain.info's tx log. 
Maybe there are other hackers out there who prefer to wait, but they will NEVER get anywhere since the guy who steels first gets the BTC. btcrobinhood has a bot that does this. It doesn't wait.
EDIT: Indeed the whole idea of "waiting" is a false notion for this reason. I wish people would stop speculating on it. That's not how it works. Any and all possible hacks are being tried NOW as we speak and are not waiting.

@_date: 2013-09-29 20:57:39
Yes, it's an escalating race. 
BTW, this is why a more comprehensive analysis of pass phrase security is only marginally possible, and only then in the short term. 
Someone posted that my sample size was too small, which is true to some extent, but first off: there's no point in repeating similar methods. eg. "waterfall28" and "completion87" are equally likely to be hacked in my opinion. And secondly once waterfall28 IS found the bot will be modified to search all words with numbers 1 - 100 attached to them. So there's no way of really knowing.
It's the Heisenberg principle of passphrase hacking (just made that up). I change the probabilities by challenging them.
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:31:43
I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Brainwallets are a good idea provided you understand what makes a REAL strong passphrase. Perhaps that's a whole other issue.
I myself get a little worried about losing private keys no matter how careful I am. So it's much easier to keep them in your head essentially. If you don't know what a brainwallet is you'll have to look that up to.
But yes, use offline wallets, brain or otherwise. OFFLINE IS KEY!
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:06:50
If you had simply salted it a little, even just capitalizing the 2nd letter of the first and last word it would almost certainly have not been hacked.

@_date: 2013-09-15 14:28:24
You are technically correct. But do a little experiment and collect all recorded phrases in the history of media (just in english for our purposes), in both written and audio form. Now calculate every possible length of a phrase within any of the given media - maybe an old episode of Frasier if it sticks in your head, WHATEVER - and THEN add a dash of randomness in the form of a few numbers or letters, maybe your initials, maybe a * or a 
In reality it won't get cracked. There just isn't the computing power. The words might as well be random at that level. The importance is the length more than anything, not so much the content. Obviously choosing a passphrase like "it was the best of times it was the worst of times" might be pushing it. But if I use "Nonetheless fiery dreams did fade and inside rooms made" which is from a Tom Robbins novel: page 81, line 34 of Jitterbug Perfume, I doubt it will EVER be tested. And that's without the dash of salt ($$$***).
But it would make a good experiment. Now I'm thinking I'll put a small amount of coin in a well known phrase and see how long it takes for it to be found, if ever. It would be fun.
I'll let the bitcoin subreddit know how it goes.

I share your caution with all things regarding BTC passphrases. I don't want anyone thinking that "threaded claRity" is a strong passphrase. 
I'm just saying it DID make a difference as it wasn't swiped compared to other word combinations that didn't have a capitalized letter. The whole idea of doing this little ad hoc experiment was to find the threshold of security in passphrases. 
It's not a coincidence that certain passphrases were found and others weren't. The bots that sweep these addresses are very thorough, or at least as thorough as they can possibly be without not being worth the effort. That could easily change in another few months. But for now, these were my results. I'll do more.

Honestly I'm just holding mine in offline wallets. Yes, I'm speculating a little, but my main reason for doing so is that it's a good way to save money because: 1. Bitcoin tends to go up in value whereas the dollar goes down. and 2. I'm less likely to go to the trouble of cashing out, even though it's quite easy with coinbase.
I think of it a bit like stock options. You have them, but you don't use them on a daily basis because it takes a week to get the money. 
I realize Bitcoin is significantly easier to exchange for dollars, but don't tell ME that! I'm trying to save money.
So long story short. It's how I save money for rainy days.
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:40:53
It's not that the addresses are protected by brain wallets, but that they are "generated" from them. So if I guess your passphrase I get your private key which unlocks your public address.
A public address is created with an algorithm that takes a private key which is the 51 character long string and creates the corresponding public address.
But if you want you can use the exact same algorithm and enter a passphrase which will then create the private key, which will THEN create the public address. 
Get it?
Also if a public address/private key pair isn't generated by a pass phrase that just means it was generated from some other source of high entropy (randomness). For example 45kkdsksjekrj984vnFe33v33ekd8Uy can be used to make a private key. You could think of it as a pass phrase, but it's hardly memorable. I'd just call it randomness.

So this might be a basic question, but this post reminds me of a question I've been meaning to ask.
How are the fees allocated to the miners. I know it has to do with adding transactions to the blockchain (the ones with higher fees are preferable). But aren't most miners in this game to "mine" coins?? No one ever talks about the transaction fees. If there is money to be made there then is it really important to have a huge ASIC rig? Couldn't you just collect transaction fees?
What am I missing?
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:08:20
No way of knowing. Seriously no one can possibly know.
My only advice would be to buy small amounts over a longer period of time. This is the most prudent way if you're someone who doesn't have a lot of disposable income.
But just remember to never invest more than you can afford to lose (common disclaimer).
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:39:59
That's exactly what I'm suggesting. It's just that it would be stored offline, but still on your phone or computer. The important part is that at no point is the private key moved online except to perform a transaction, and even then it would be the smallest amount necessary (a series of small amounts if need be).
Storing bitcoins offline on PAPER is great for holding/hoarding, but it sure ain't convenient for an everyday spender about town.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:26:02
If it makes you feel any better I've already gotten my money's worth, if you will, by having already spent more than what I've invested.
So while it may be imprudent to not cash out entirely on "free money" and pay off all my debt, I can't say that I don't deserve to face the consequences of taking that risk. 
I realize I'm looking at this in retrospect, but if I invest $100.00, watch it grow to a thousand, spend $500.00, is it a bad idea to keep the other $500.00 in BTC? I only put in $100.00. I've ALREADY obviated the risk by spending more than I put in. It almost seems "greedy" to cash out. Of course holding onto my BTC might increase my wealth by several thousand dollars, but at least I'm also taking a risk. I could lose it all, but if I did I would STILL be ahead in the grand scheme.
It would be one thing if I worked hard for that money and put it all on the line, but I didn't, I just invested early enough to see a nice return. But I didn't really earn it. So I feel that I'm in no obligation to be "responsible" with something that I didn't earn.
