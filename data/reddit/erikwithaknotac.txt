@_date: 2014-07-03 12:13:13
You can use the price of consumer goods as a source. For example, a Nike drifit shirt has gone up (msrp) about a dollar a year. 2009 it was $20, now it's $25. That's about 5% increase every year.

Seriously. Bitquick.co should be on there. It is a much better way to get coins than localbitcoins as the escrow service eliminates a lot of scammers and the customer support is always replying to me in minutes if I have a question.

More like prediction, not really opinion. Predictions can be proved/disproved, and posting that shit on a public forum makes you wide open to criticism and ridicule. Or if you were correct, cite it in an "I told you so" post for sweet sweet props and Karma.

Yea, I had this as a direct import clone of my Ebay store. 
I guess I could have put more time into it. The items are all mine tho, and the discount is what eBay would have taken if I sold the item with them.
Edit: I'm bad at making sites, erikesales.com for example, but thank you for pointing that out. The About US page is not as DEFAULTy looking anymore.

-is being passionate a bad thing? No. The bitcoin community is outspoken and activist. 
-as an unregulated market, the bitcoin economy has been doing a good job weeding out bad companies. The media just somehow makes a failure of a bad company seem to reflect negatively on bitcoin as a whole. While any of the millions of failed restaurants every year do not reflect the same way with any economy they represent.

I saw this and called someone who is an expert on official policy at TSA. Conclusion: "WTF is bitcoin?" This is overblown.

Also a safe store of value, discounts from merchants, ease of transactions. Ability to get into premium porn sites without worrying that they will force you into a monthy recurring charge.

Companies that decided to accept Bitcoin have taken  some risk, especially if they decided to hold Bitcoin, to gain a competitive edge against competition. When Bitcoin acceptance reaches saturation, the need to offer additional perks seems necessary to maintain that edge.

Ok. I'll bite. The amount of bitcoins mined is a controlled rate. As more miners join the network, difficulty gets harder, allowing that controlled pace of newly minted coins to remain the same. Over time, the amount of coins released to miners gets halved and halved and halved, until the last fraction of a bitcoin is mined 100+ years from now.
The price goes up when the demand is more than the amount mined. As it has been stable for a while, growth is about equal to demand.

I was explaining why it recovered. And why it will recover after the next crash, and the next one. I bought early, and have been through these cycles many times before. Bitcoin has surpassed every investment I have ever made, including my own business. Your making fun of a temporary downslope is part of every slide, but you'll mysteriously keep quiet once it passes the high of 2 months ago.

If they integrated Bitcoin, they would also open up the doorway for users to realize they don't even need paypal once they get fmailiar with Bitcoin. So they're fucked both ways.
@_date: 2014-03-19 09:49:17
Well, you made a bet on a risky exchange with a risky currency and now want to be bailed out. You are the type of person that will destroy bitcoin.

Probably true. I did throw some money at genesis-mining, in case you're wrong.

No one denies economic darwinism will happen. Shitty companies will fail, but companies that actually offer something innovative will make it. Bitcoin is no different than any other sector. I doubt there will be a a crash like you say.

I wanted to see if I could make some money on my coins just having them sit there, but after some consideration, pulled them back into cold storage. The amount I made wasn't worth the risk.

That charter is such a bs talking point, like when they say Iran wants to eliminate Israel off the map. If you look into it, it's not as bad as it seems. But you don't want to hear about that. Keep saying they're unreasonable animals that must continue to be caged. I guess that will nake you feel better when you see those pictures of dead children.

In order for the price to go up, people have to sell to people buying. Everyone has a price, and not everyone will hold the same amount of btc when it is a million. 
A lot of those top addresses are exchanges so the amount will.fluctuate with time. You should stop spending your bitcoin on hatorade and hodl.

High Market cap=Larger amount of money able to be transferred.
Also the ability to purchase a large amount of Bitcoins at a certain price point is much more possible with a higher price. For example: The BearWhale incident could never have happened when Bitcoin was $1. There wouldn't be enough Bitcoins to provide that much of a $9 million dollar sell wall.
@_date: 2014-05-24 21:30:42
Every 2 weeks, the mining difficulty has gone up by 30%. EVERY WEEK. So yeah if you waited, it's too late to make money mining. Most of the big players just reinvest their money into more hardware trying to keep up with the mining arms race.

Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. And I'm happy, tonight.

Her business license, more bs paperwork, more regulation requirements, especially with the.new tax rules. They're just waiting for the more adventurous business owners to dip their feet. Once they see they have no issues, the more cautious will follow. Keep in mind, while Bitcoin may be a nice hobby or sidejob for us, this is their entire careers. Patience. I guess. Let's hope there are no more speed bumps to more adoption.

38 bitcoin.... How is $8700 15 years of income? You can make that back in a few months doing a few hustles, don't kill yourself, you can make a lot more money.
Early on, I sold Bitcoin through Google Checkout. I was dumb and got charged back about 200 Bitcoins worth at $15 each. I didn't give up on Bitcoin, though. I kept buying and made that money back. Take it as a lesson learned and move on.
Your roomates admitted stealing? Call the cops.

I remember thats where pirateat40 stock traded, it was locked out, and people that had access to it created passthrough stocks, so people that were late to the party could buy in and trade. I think he paid out like 7% a week. Passthrough stocks paid out like 6% in dividends. It was a ridiculous time.
You can search through old reddit posts about it. It was the paycoin of its time.

A lot of local Bitcoin meetups, we end up meeting and doing the transaction off the books for less fees. I'd say that actual volume is actually more than triple because of this under-reporting.

Can you make 4% a year with your bitcoin? Then why don't you just get a mortgage and use profits only to pay off the interest and/or principal. 
Also. In 30 years, 360 payments, 1.388 bitcoin if paid up front each month, but  by year 30, you might need to only sell .005btc to make a payment, Saving you a ton of BTC

Foxconn gets a lot of shit, but the people lining up to work there are still there. You can't compare work conditions of differing economies like they're the same. We had our industrial revolution and it was worse. As a country gets more of a middle class, worker's rights evolve.

So what would this do to bitcoin? Would the blocks splinter up? 
@_date: 2016-09-06 19:26:38
Poor can't benefit from Bitcoin. 
You're poor because 
1. Mentally/physically  deficient 
2. Poorly or not educated to take advantage of opportunities. 
3. Bad decisions and a lot of debt. 
So unless Bitcoin is as easy to understand as a crumbly rolled up dollar, the poor have other shit to worry about than finding Internet moneys.
Also, being poor means you're at or close to subsistence living. If you did redeem that dollar, it would be used up to feed kids, pay rent, or other pending emergency. The benefits of an inflation-proof currency would be lost on those that cannot understand what an investment is, much less even delay gratification or even necessity to have one.

I buy my weekly amount of btc with my paycheck. That btc comes from miners, if that amount halves, and my weekly buy is the same, then it becomes more expensive. People CAN anticipate this, buy I can only buy so much at a time. If this is the case for thousands more people, then yeah. It's not priced in. We don't have the ability to buy puts and calls to further price in supply shortages.

Your comment was so bad, it made me angry. No offense, but go fuck yourself.
1. if serious- Satoshi is known to have millions of coins to his name, and would not make himself public. 
2. If you're joking as a pro-Bitcoiner, you're saying Satoshi would try to gain a larger share of Bitcoin, making a worse Bitcoin ecosystem. 
3. If you're a troll, you're saying Satoshi, probably NSA with pockets large enough to make a bid, sees Bitcoin as a system that will become powerful and has a need to own a larger share, nullifying your point of trolling Bitcoin. 
On all fronts a shitty comment. And has enraged me. I'll finish my wine now.

The Russian Government takes bitcoin as a threat to public
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation plans to take all necessary measures for the introduction of penalties for the use of Cryptocurrency in the country.
This was recently said Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev . Recently, the situation around Bitcoin in Russia has deteriorated significantly, and if earlier statements by the authorities were more warning character, but now it turned quite differently.
POLICE WILL NOT THROW OBJECTIONABLE BAG WITH DRUGS, AND USB FLASH DRIVE WITH BITCOIN WALLETS
Especially for Forklog situation commented Artem Kozlyuk, one of the founders of the movement against censorship on the Internet:
"I suppose that this law, like all previous ones, aimed at state regulation of the network and interact in it will work in manual mode. I do not think that the CBR or some other agency will be downright spud Internet in search of those who use Cryptocurrency. But this law can touch the specific persons who have been instructed to "Bite!". That is introduced another virtual hatchet, which can fall on the head of anyone, but I do not think that all at the same time " .
It is likely that this law be limited to a point of law enforcement, and in conditions of Russian reality unscrupulous police will not objectionable toss a bag of drugs, and the stick-with Bitcoin wallet.
However, because of the specific technology Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency users in Russia will not disappear. And promising, albeit informal, the Russian market will get Western companies. A similar situation arose in connection with retaliatory sanctions from Russia to the Western countries: import substitution appeared a distant dream, but the lion's share of the liberated market is gradually coming under the influence of China. For example, the company recently Alibaba began working in Russia as a result of what to expect mass replacement of European goods to the Chinese, with complete lack of competitiveness of Russian products.
"The law on surrogate currencies put an end to the final desired different kinds of companies to accept Cryptocurrency. While this is just an undesirable factor, and after leading law already may suffer for them and direct punishment ", - said Artem Kozlyuk.
STATE PERCEIVES THIS AS A THREAT TO ITS EXISTENCE
Judging by the news of this year, a similar outcome for Bitcoins in Russia was obvious. One gets the impression that the Russian authorities are very consistent and warn of their intentions in advance. Since the beginning of this year there was a blokirovaka bitcoin resources , and some time later the deputy from the Liberal Democratic Party, which is implicitly considered the mouthpiece of the ruling party, said that bitcoin - a CIA plot against Russia .
"Yes, it's another step to regress and repressive measures on the web. This artificial inhibition of the progress of knowledge and active network of human interaction in different forms. State perceives this as a threat to its existence. That it is impossible to control and understand the official in his head - to forbid! "

Not back their currency per say, I think a country will build up reserves in Bitcoin first. Like the IMF advised a few years back. Then it will be a buying race. We should place bets on who will buy first.

Money transfers. Run a business and see how much you spend on credit card and online transactions. Bitcoin means cheaper prices once merchants see the savings, they'll pass those savings on to you if you pay with bitcoin.
Ever try wiring money to another country? It's a pain in the ass, and the fees are ridiculous. Bitcoin eliminates all this.
Even not considering it's appreciation of value, it can store value in places like Africa where most people do not have a bank account, but most people have cell phones. No need to hold bulky stacks of trillion dollar bills when moving around, now it can be on your phone, password protected.

This is complementary. Poor and non-tech people send Western Union all the time. Adopting Bitcoin as the transmission backbone brings those NOT in Bitcoin's target demographic that much closer to it. It is a simplifier. People don't need to know about the nuances of cryptocurrency and blockchains, they just need to know that their money will get to where they want it to go.

You can't hold their hands on being rich. Fuck them. You shouldn't feel guilty. I have resorted to just giving people money in bitcoins in small amounts. They choose to buy more, cool, if not. They need to slit their own throats, not direct their anger at you. 
Fuck you guy for not being convincing enough. Fuck you for not taking money out of your pocket and taking the risk for me because i'm too much of a pussy. Fuck you for telling me about the opportunity of a lifetime and fuck you for me not taking a risk. That is their thinking and you shouldn't feel bad for their stupidity.

Using the coins for things is great for the bitcoin economy but that alone does not drive up the price, it is when people spend their country's money to buy bitcoins that drives the price up. Commerce with bitcoins only strengthens the scope and acceptance of bitcoins (what we really need more than speculation) and that MIGHT eventually make more demand for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:33:31
THAT is why the price dropped after Black Friday!

This is pretty one sided. 
1. It's not completely anonymous, 
2. going from 1200 to 700 is still up for the month, 
3. no one was actually killed in Ulbrich's hits. 
4. Most of the top wallets are abandoned and have not seen activity in years, and the US gov't has the most. 
5. Why attack the main fact that bitcoin wallets are like cash? you lose it, you lose your cash. Why no stories of dumbfucks that get drunk and lose their real wallets as a case against fiat? 
6. The greedy miner case was quickly debunked, why would miners want to destabilize their investment? maybe when it was done with desktops, but now miners pay lots of cash up front for these miners, why fuck that up? Also this happens over time as theoretically more miners join the cheating pool, Gavin could see that coming and tell them to knock it off or get ignored by the system.
This is something right wing talk radio does, tell half the story to uninformed listeners.

You can't quote 'historical trends' if it is only 4 years old. It's like saying children grow teeth their first 5 years and lose teeth the next 5 years and grow and lose them every 5 years 'historically'

Without the early supporters, Bitcoin wouldn't be a thing. If anything the halvingtells you to get in on it now before it halves again. a 1/3 decrease puts less urgency on it, something deadly for a new tech.

@_date: 2013-11-02 10:51:21
I buy bitcoins with my disposable income. When I eventually do want to buy something, like my xbox , the money I put away over time makes buying it with bitcoin cheap. I will always buy more bitcoins on payday, so Its cheaper to buy with bitcoin and replace your spendings when you can. 
For example, that soda is $1 but actually  $ .75 if you bought bitcoin last month and pay with bitcoin. It takes a bit of budgeting to buy next month's stuff with bitcoin, but it cones out cheaper.

Edit: not saying bitcoin isn't the adaptive scrappy underdog now, just that inertia is a real thing once you're at the top.

A 'terrorist attack' either prevented just in time, or actually executed, when the news reports on how they organized it, Feds just say funding was facilitated by Bitcoin.

Sold with Google Checkout, made some decent returns, most people were legit, 30% were scammers. One long time customer (3 months of buying) who never had chargebacks wanted me to sell him more and more bitcoins each week. I said sure, he hadn't charged me back. He passed the google checkout verify test and i was guaranteed google would cover chargebacks if they did happen. Two months into this, hundreds of bitcoins a week, I get the first chargeback from this guy. 5 months after the transaction. i call google, they say yeah, they'll cover it, as long as I have proof of shipping. I show them the blockchan, they laugh. I show them USPS packages I sent to him as well, its outside the US, so tracking stops at US customs, they say that it is not enough. I would have been a bitcoin millionaire by now If i hadn;t lost those bitcoins and the money i had to pay back. There is NO protection for you. NO FUCKING protection at all.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:33:19
I bought as the first crash happened. I bought all the way down to $2. I bought some nice stuff at the top, made a nice cut on my initial investment.. I didn't sell the rest. I plan on buying all the way down here as well.
