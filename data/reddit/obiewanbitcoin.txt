That's right. I almost forgot about airbitz. I'm not sure why but it's not one of my favorite apps. I've given it several fair attempts. Thanks for the feedback.

We spend a year telling the community they're going to have to get rid of the idea of smooth and cheap transactions, then we're confused when they pay fees higher than the network requires. How many posts have berated people for not including enough in fees?

Two of my officemates were pretty much turned off to bitcoin after waiting for it do its thing. I hope it improves, but I currently prefer Mycelium by a wide margin.

Pretty surprising to me. I don't own an iOS device, but Mycelium is my favoirte wallet by far and I recommend it to iOS users.. is there a competitive wallet for iOS? There was lots of talk about breadwallet, but it was slow and clunky.

I'd say it's more likely that many people have had their voice removed by banning or censorship and the remaining voices can only be heard through voting. Their votes reflect attitudes toward the moderation here. Users are frustrated because the groupthink you just cited as a tool against is actually promoted by the management of this Reddit against the community.

Because bitcoin has a governance crisis that many people refuse to acknowledge.

Just a few quick questions: 
1. Who is We? 
2. Am **I** "We"? 
3. If I am "We", where can I get my share of the coins that I will definitely hand out to children?
This really is a great idea, I've had similar thoughts but never carried it this far. We should talk about doing things like this more often.

Sounds about right. Bitcoin had the keys to the castle but allowed nefarious actors to steer it in the wrong direction. Here's to the future of the blockchain!
