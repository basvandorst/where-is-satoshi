No one can "print" new bitcoins out of nowhere like we do with fiat money, see zimbabwe, venezuela or even the US itself when we bailed out the bank, create more debt, etc. Whenever we do that, it means that the government is devaluing the value of your money, of your past work to help correct the system. Now, you may have noticed that our governments are not that good at this and that there whenever the system fails, there doesn't seem to be new incentives for those that are bailed out to correct themselves. So why trust them with the control of money if they have no skin in the game?
Meanwhile, all new bitcoins come from a costly mining operation and there are a finite amount of bitcoins, I believe 21 millions or something of which 17 millions have already been mined. Basically, everyone plays by the same rule, there is no central authority that has dictatorial power like the federal reserve.

Yes it is a conspiracy theory as far as the "official" information available is concerned. The fact of the matter is a lot of weird shit and coincidences happened in 2016, especially in October when Assange was isolated. Questioning the official narrative is perfectly normal and healthy.

Tbh, it's probably going to the CIA at this point. All the top Wikileaks people "died" in 2016 and Assange is not in charge. The last Wikileaks release was also a complete dud, user manuals for CIA hacking tools that had already been leaked on the dark web at the time.

He only published the material he was sent and there is no evidence he ever refused to publish material he was received. Accusing him of bias and wanting to "stick it to the us" is straight bs at this point.

The Wikileaks insurance files were also all changed with new hashes shortly after Assange was "isolated" in oct 2016. It isn't outside the realm of possibilities that perhaps they were faking that Assange was still in control afterwards while controlling the wikileaks twitter account, etc. Assange's tweeting starting when he randomly finally created his personal twitter instead of always using the Wikileaks one in 2017 always seemed a bit off and unlike him to me. 
Plus it's not like the CIA and other intel agencies haven't done far more complex schemes in the past.
Imagine secretly being in control of Wikileaks for them, they get to receive potentially huge leaks ahead of time and potentially get to act to shut them down before they go public.

You're a dumb fuck if you're using coinbase anyway.

So tired of these neocon boomers and their obsession with Iran holy shit could I give less of a fuck about what is fucking going on over there. All these old fucks are bought and paid for by AIPAC, completely fucking disgraceful.
