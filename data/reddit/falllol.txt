If various antivirus software start complaining when you enter reddit (or just boot up your computer) because of it, then yes, people will be scared.

You are talking like we have never seen deflationary spiral play out in the real world and that it is just a theory and when it happens it will work?
You are aware that we *have* seen what a deflationary economy is like right?

Sigh forgot you guys were incapable of doing modicum amount of research to save your lives.
Have you ever heard of the Great Depression? It's not a story whitepaper.pdf would tell you.
You probably have ADHD too so do a ctrl+f for deflation.
Or ever heard of the Japanese Lost Decade? Which eventually became Lost 20 years? Which then became Lost 30 years? And is a still current phenomenon Japan is still trying to recover from after decades?

Your post doesn't explain how it might have happened per the information OP gave us.
He says he didn't make a transaction. He didn't enter the password. He had an encrypted wallet, he opened the official client (which doesn't need you to enter your password to see your funds) and he saw the transaction from there. OP said he didn't make a transaction (which requires the password to be typed) before seeing his bitcoins gone.
