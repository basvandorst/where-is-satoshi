I do understand many printers put invisible dots on the printed pages so any document can be traced back to the printer. Thats not such a concern as networked data.

I suppose it could have went there, but my questions directly concern paper wallets.

Mine is a consumer Canon Pixma, although the question is directed to printers in general. I'm certain there is no hard drive in mine, but there could be a memory buffer or temporary place for recent data. I'm more concerned about data being sent out over the internet.

IMHO that defeats the purpose of printing a cold storage wallet, because now you must keep that password secure somewhere else. We are talking about plain text private keys  (or seed) we can store in a safe deposit box or home safe.

If you want to go that route just stick to old non-network printers, or write down the sensitive data instead of using a printer. I'm willing to bet the average joe won't be thinking about the security of his printer.

So if I understand this correctly the security of your bitcoin has been reduced from a 12 word random lettered phrase to 12 random letters. Although quite secure, not nearly as secure as the phrase itself.

Convenience is the last priority for large stashes of coins, security is. Keep online only what you need for daily transactions and you'll sleep better ;)
