An interesting point in the press release from CBR is that using virtual currencies in Russia will be treated by authorities as potential involvement into money laundering and terrorism.
In view of recent sharp fall of Rouble, this doesn't really surprise me.

IANAL, but I guess that by "surrogates" they mean something like MMM shares (a Ponzi-like story from 90s).

Банк России предупреждает, что предоставление российскими юридическими лицами услуг по обмену «виртуальных валют» на рубли и иностранную валюту, а также на товары (работы, услуги) будет рассматриваться как потенциальная вовлеченность в осуществление сомнительных операций в соответствии с законодательством о противодействии легализации (отмыванию) доходов, полученных преступным путем, и финансированию терроризма.
For those who don't read Russian:
The Bank of Russia warns that legal entities providing services of exchanging virtual currencies into Rouble or foreign currencies or goods or services will be considered as potentially involved into doubtful operations in accordance with the laws on prevention money laundering and financing terrorism.

Thanks. Can you tell us about your background? How did you end up working with Bitcoin?

Thanks, this is quite good point, indeed. People are probably willing to pay some extra for privacy.

A question about Bitcoin BTMs your company is installing in Finland. What is, in your opinion, the major customer need that these machines are addressing?

Your name doesn't sound Finnish, so: are you a Finn?

How come the URL in blockchain.info points to this sub?

Hey, it's simply awesome that you have this kind of relationship with your dad. You are both good people, and I wish I was that close to my parents when they were still alive. How old are you, btw?
Say hello to your dad. Love you both.
Edit: don't listen to all those stupid fucks who say negative things in this thread. You both are infinitely better than any of them.
