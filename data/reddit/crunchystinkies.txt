I agree, there is demand. But the BOTTOM line is they CANNOT back it up with **BLOOD**. ALL respected currencies are backed with BLOOD. Claiming you don't realize this, IS conclusive evidence of a CON GAME, given the current KNOWN circumstances.

There is NOTHING backing/supporting it (like an army). It will end in tears due to hipster manipulators who are manipulating YOU at this very minute with talk about "venture capital" infusions. this is basically Ivey league robs the shit out of the stupid, greedy, dufus's as usual. takes the inside track, leaves the unsophisticated sucker in the weeds...again. Thye're still trying to draw suckers in (with the support of their %1'er parents no doubt!) at this point.

Oh... honor...sheesh. The powers that be want CONTROL. They use gold and silver. They will NOT allow you to introduce "tree bark" or "used tampons" into the mix, it would dilute their power.

WRONG! Fatty. Gold has no more value (other than practical) than a fiat currency.
Bitcoin....Shitcoin....it can ONLY end in tears. Don't come running to me when that happens.

See the armies of the world. That would be THEM.

You're a lovely person on the inside.
Yes, I agree, BUT that is ALWAYS backed in BLOOD..
Wheels is EXACTLY the point! Currency is linked to wheels and BLOOD.
bitcoin is linked to evil (anonymous).
DEATH to weasals.

Not necessary. Ever hear of "pump and dump"?  That's what's happening here.
