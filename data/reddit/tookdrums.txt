Bon travail Bruno !

I works because it is a race to bottom.
As an example:
If fee were high then I would change my node to a lightning node and offer cheaper fee for for rooting... 
Since everybody thinks like that, it works.

Every channel is only between 2 users: from A to B.
But if A has a channel with B and B has a channel with C, then A (assuming she has the fund available) can pay a lightning transaction to C.
The biggest use case I see is every few months open a channel with a "payment hub/lightning node" with a few hundreds mbtc and use that to pay my future coffee with instant almost free transactions.
It's already possible to use it for peer to peer payment assuming there is a route available through the lightning network. But so far receiving money through lightning channel has more requirement to be 100% secure and trust-less (one of this requirement is having or trusting a node monitoring the blockchain at least once a day to check the the lightning channel wasn't unilaterally closed with an outdated state which doesn't reflect the last payment you received)
If you only spend then in every old state of the channel you have a bigger balance so there is not this need to monitor the blockchain.

From my try with the testnet.
Transaction took about 1-4 seconds. Most of it is due to routing.
There is no need to wait for confirmation.

LN doesn't require segwit, but a secure LN requires it (or a least another malleability fix).
Segwit fix the malleability problem (same transaction but different transaction ID) which is important to fix to have a secure LN.

More than raw sync time there is also the bandwidth usage that comes with a block increase.

That is a good advice overall but not protecting against meltdown or spectre as the point of those attack is to read the memory from other processes.

Unless you can compute hash with a pen and paper I don't see it happening.
You can generate a transaction safely using this tool
you don't need to expose the private key, only the public address.
Of course that creates an unsigned transaction, to sign it you can use the same tool on an airgapped clean computer.

@_date: 2017-12-28 08:30:19
Okay I see so let's assume it pays alice 0.9 then unilaterally close the channel. 
Then the answer to your problem is statistic. with one day in blocktime for alice to post a you-lied-i-get-everything-transaction (in the same mempool/fee condition as bob's closing transaction) 
Then it is very likely that Alice will post that transaction and 99% of chance to lose 0.1BTC versus 1% winning 0.9 BTC is not worth it.
The risk can be also mitigated by:
 1 only using lighning to send payment (like the eclair testnet wallet) that way zero risk all outofdate states will be in your favor.
 2 Do not do a transaction (within the channel) that would make the other party balance go below the fee you would have to pay to force a set-te-record-transaction.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:43:50
I don't quite follow your reasoning.
 I just think the original comment makes sense because IMHO, there should be in the automated test suite a test where a block containing a transaction with duplicate inputs is deemed invalid.
@_date: 2018-09-27 13:50:36
You can create an infinity of hidden wallet though. (although on the ledger you can only attach a pin to a second one, but you can open the others temporarily by retyping your passphrases)
As long as you never publicly reveal how much you own you should be good.
Of course being a little aware about what kind of information is available on the blockchain helps. Your coins are much more traceable than originally thought even with change addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:44:14
the testnet eclair wallet on android informed me of a good way to mitigate that risk:
They do not provide payment receive on the lighning address for now. That way you only use your eclair channel to send bitcoins (and close it when you are done). That way any outdated state of the channel that could be maliciously posted would be in your favor (Doesn't contains your last payments).
This is not perfect but it allows instant very low fee transactions, which makes the bitcoin coffee possible.

@_date: 2018-09-27 14:42:43
Here the duplicated fund when to the fees. Would it be possible to create another 0.1 tBTC output or it has to go to the fee to avoid some kind of test on the transaction.
@_date: 2018-09-28 17:43:51
Between satochi or BTC, bit byte vByte or weightunit there are plenty of different ways to display your fee.
The minimum fee is:
1 satochi/VB
or 0.250 satochi/WU
or 	0.00001 BTC/kVB
Blockchain.info shows something different because it shows byte and note vByte (which include the size of the signature data removed by segwit)
Can I ask you which wallet are you using ? (I'm curious about the one supporting bech32 addresses (starts with bc1)
@_date: 2018-09-27 18:09:03
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:32:06
It is not locked.
You can unilateraly close a channel in case the other party goes offline like here.
The drawback is, it is gonna wait for one day (in block time) before the coins are sent back to you.

I'm trying the android eclair wallet.

Quick my blockoccino is gonna be cold.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:54:54
If the other party unilaterally close the channel with an out of date state then you pay the fee to publish a set-record-straight transaction and it will always worth it because you gain all the BTC of the channel not just the discrepancy. 
On the testnet you had one day of block time to receive btc after a channel is unilaterally closed.
So with the right transaction fee it shoudn't bee a problem. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:09:17
Correct me if I'm wrong but in my mind the transaction is being broadcasted:
 * You create a transaction with your wallet
 * You broadcast it to a node who puts it in his mempool
 * The miners are the one taking transaction from the mempool to create a block
 * the mined block is itself broadcasted.
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:28:16
Am I right in thinking that since both input are exact duplicate it would mean that you could create a transaction with more than twice the same inputs?
One rogue block could temporary create an infinity of bitcoins.
And all this because one Boolean in the code was turned From false to TRUE for the sake of optimization.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:13:43
A channel is only between 2 people.
Then there is lightning rooting which would work this way:
if A as a channel with B and B has a channel with C then A can pay something to C (through 2 lightning transactions)
So your Bob sends 0.9 BTC via the channel, e.g. to some exchange or merchant is not possible.
those 1 BTC stay between Alice and Bob 
Technicaly if Alice has an open channel with the said "exchange or Marchant" then Bob could send them the .9 btc (by sending them to alice and alice sending 0.9 btc to the exchanges)

My comment wasn't to blame the guy at all. 
I have the utmost respect for everyone who contributed time to this project.
@_date: 2018-09-21 19:48:45


How would a miner do that ?
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:27:14
The code was there.
It was an optimization error where someone removed the test in order to speed up the process of validating a block.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:34:20
Except here it was not a typo, the developer  consciously removed the test for duplicate inputs to speed up the process of validating a block.
It was a smart idea as the input is marked as unclean (or something) when is it used in another transaction in the same block it just so happened that he (and everybody else until a few days ago) didn't realize that you could use the same input twice in the same transaction.
I can see how my comment appeared to be blaming the guy when all I meant is that he must feel bad. And I like you hope he can reframe their persective, I'm sure he is also responsible for plenty of others changes immensely valuable to the software.
@_date: 2018-09-28 17:08:21
this transaction was validated this morning
You are using segwit address here so what is important is the satochi/weight unit.
I think the minimum included by miners is at 0.250 satochi/weight unit which correspond to the 1 satochi/byte you are use to.
more information here:
So don't worry your transaction will go through as soon as the mempool is small enough.

Yes, the name is tether coin. They back every tether coin with one actual dollar in reserve. Its price always stays at $1.
The catch is sometime there is not enough liquidity so the usd price might differ a little bit. But still, it is a great way to protect against bitcoin dip without generating capital gain.

So if I hear you right that is the set up phase that annoys you. But you really only do it once like 2 on chain transactions max. That seems like such a small price to pay to stay in control of your coins no?
You say you don't see any advantage in non custodial but to me the  most amazing part about bitcoin is not having to trust anybody. Using a custodial wallet to save 60 minutes of time at set up sound contrary to what bitcoin represent to me.
I'm curious if you tried the wallets I'm mentioning. Is the experience different from bluewallet? I must say I installed bluewallet but never actually used it once I realized it was custodial but the interface looked similar to me.

 Bitcoin lightning wallet is a non custodial android wallet who allows receiving fairly easily. They have a watch tower service and several other nice features. LNBIG will open an incoming channel to you for free (albeit they have more fee than the usual channels so it is better to open a channel to another node and spend a little so you have room for incoming payment).
If you have more than $1 you can always use something like the zig zag exchange that will send you on chain BTC for the same amount in lightning minus the transaction fee.

The address where the funds are stored starts by 3.
This means this is a p2sh address or pay to script hash.
On the contrary address starting by 1 are p2pk (pay to private key)
There is a standard to sign and verify message associated to p2pk address. But there is no standard with p2sh address. Some wallets like electrum created something to mimic the p2pk signing process but it is not bitcoin standardized yet.
A more in depth explication of why it is not standard is that although a lot of the p2sh address are just verifying that you hold the private key associated to a specific public key, not all of them are, you could in theory create a script for a p2sh address that is not linked to any private key. (it could be just a time check or something) and in this case a signed message wouldn't make sense.

* All my coins in eclair are locked in channels except for a few sats
* I send 15$ to my eclair p2sh address
* I use eclair to send the 0.002 btc or so to bitcoin lightning wallet
* I want to start a channel fund available 235 000 sats minimum channel required 300 000

For anything lower than 0.1 BTC if I were a marchant, I would accept 0-conf as long as the transaction has rbf disable and the fee are bigger than the upper 1Mb traansaction from the mempool. I wish there was a point of sale system that would generate transaction QR code encoding this options:

I am yet to find someone who actually tried eclair or BLW and find it actually hard to set up. Of course you will have to first move bitcoin to the wallet and then open a channel so it can take a while to get initially set up (usually a channel require 6 confirmation) but that something you only have to do once.

I don't know about you, but I'm writing here because I will take any opportunity to learn something, so feel free to correct me if anything I say is wrong.


to me accepting 0-conf definitely means accepting the transaction (as in letting the shopper get out of the shop with his product) without waiting for a confirmation.
My understanding toward (RBF) replace by fee is that any well behaving node will not accept another transaction that spend the same input as long as it has already one in its mempool.
I was under the impression that to double spend an input used in a non RBF transaction you would need to be a miner that would include the new (overly categorized as the illegal one for most of the nodes) transaction and including in your block.
So (and again feel free to correct me if anything I say is wrong) if I am a merchant who doesn't want to have every client waiting around 10 minutes for a first block validation my choice are:
*  without RBF basically I'm betting on the fact that the client is not the director of one of the mining pool.
* With RBF ( I absolutely have to wait for the first confirmation) as otherwise there is nothing that would prevent the client as soon as he leaves the store to create another transaction spending the same inputs but sending them to himself with a bigger fee. Since the first transaction as RBF enabled this second transaction would become the legitimate one and replace the first one in the mempool of most node.

Adding an additional passphrase greatly increase the security of your back up (at the cost of having to remember the passphrase or setting up a different back up process for it) .
If you don't own a safe to hide your back up word seed and rely on dissemination, then this provide a reliable extra security.
With it you can also for example store a back up at your family or friends for safekeeping and they cannot access your funds.

thank you.
I have been playing with lightning for a while now but just received my first payment!
Payout successful!
5897 satoshi or 0.38 USD has been paid out to your account! 
I was wondering, since you seem knowledgeable in lighning.
Is there an easy way to open a channel that is balanced 50% 50% with the node?
Because I'm thinking that if a marchant just set up his node and lightning network to be able to receive payments he needs to have incoming flow possible on existing channels. 
Otherwise the buyers needs to open a new channel maybe directly to the seller. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:51:27
I think I understand your analogy, but i think it is missing a big difference between banks and lightning network. 
Even though lightning can use hubs to transfer the money, those hubs are not in control of the money. There is no censorship possible and your actual bitcoin are yours and can only be sent to their intended destination.
Worst case scenario you have to wait one day to close the channel and receive your coins in case you have to unilaterally close the channel.

They are non custodial wallets which means you control your private key (unlike blockchain wallet i think).

For your full stack I recommend mycelium, samourai wallet or better à hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:57:21
Thanks. Honestly I love this wallet. It is open source. They already have great services like watch towers. You can and should create a back up of your channel state that you encrypt with your private key and upload to both google drive or one of their olympus server.
That way you can restore both your on chain funds and your lightning channels just with the mnemonics of the private key (and the encrypted backup)

But if the tricked party just enforce the newer state then there is no punishment for the party that tried to cheat so he basically has nothing to loose to try to cheat no?
The way I see it with the punishment in place the watch tower are almost not necessary because who would try to cheat if it means losing fund of the whole channel in the likely event that the tricked party will go online in the next 2 weeks.

Bitcoin lightning wallet (android) is a good example of a non-custodial (You maintain the private key) lightning wallet.
It is crucial to understand that BLW is a standalone app, it is not a thin client to a centralized service.
This most importantly means that your money is stored right on your phone and nowhere else which gives you a ultimate censorship resistance: no one can ‘freeze your account’ or cancel your transactions, but at the same time this makes you the only one responsible for securing your funds.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:36:03

Sorry I don't know about the specific of trezor, I'm pretty sure you can use electrum too.
For me the point about a hardware wallet is to never have the seed (or private key) leaving the wallet. 
(except at the initial set up when you carve your seed words on metal and hide it in your gransma's safe). 
To expand on the not safe part I said :


What I meant by it is using an offline machine where you would use a tool like coleman bip39 to write your 24 word seed and get the specific private key you need.
I consider a word seed compromised the minute you type it on a keyboard...(any keyboard)
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:48:57
shnorr signatures is mostly advantageous to the case when you have several inputs being signed with the same private keys.
For example if you have a BTC donation address and receive plenty of small donation to this address then spending all those inputs in a transaction would require only one signature instead of one by inputs saving a considerable amount of size hence fee.
The splicing discussed here have more effect on the different outputs a transaction can have so shnorr is less relevant here. Even in the case of batching where there are a lot of inputs the private key are different so here again shnorr play a little role.

There is another actual very good protection for new coins that want to use the same hashing algo. It is called merged mining. In simplified terms when you mine a block you also create a transaction with the hash of the block in it that you broadcast to the bigger coin blockchain creating a checkpoint.
That way you benefit from the security of the bigger chain. more and more new coins start using it. Feel free to ask if you have question about it.

This chapter by Andreas has all the information you are looking for:
I assume you know about derivation path? something like : m/44'/0'/0'/0/1
Think of it like the PATH/list of operation you apply to your seed to get to a specific public/private key
An interesting tool from hierachical wallet is the xpub It allows you to have a watch only wallet that can compute all the public key but not the private key.
The drawback of that is that if you leak a private key You can compute the rest of the private keys by using it with the xpub with two exceptions:
 * You cannot go back up the derivation tree because there is a hash involved in the computation so you can only go lower down the derivation tree
 * Some of the tree branch have " ' " in them that means it is a hardened derivation that requires the original seed/to be able to go through it down the derivation tree.
But really read the chapter I send you and send a BTC tip to Andreas for the awesome job he did/is doing

Listen to the most upvoted comments here, it's safe but have some drawbacks.
The biggest missing piece of information though is that you cannot sign message with ledger live now.
And even offline exprting your private key to sign a message is definitely not safe.
So The easiest way I can think of tho do it is to install electrum on desktop.
Set up a wallet with your ledger.
Follow this tutorial to sign a message with the right address (there is still no standard for segwit p2sh ot bech32 address so YMMV)
That way to you can sign a message while keeping the private key (and wordseed) completely safe inside the ledger.

You are wrong on the bruteforce attack on the ledger.
I was worried about it too so I asked and checked.
They are 2 different counters.
If you are forced to give a pin give the first one (no passphrase)
the hidden passphrase counter will be reset only after a succesfull log into this one. After 3 failed test the hidden pass will be erased leaving only the original wordseed (without passphrase)

modify you bitcoin.conf file and add
    dbcache="put half of your memory in MB ex:4000 if you have 8 Go"
    par=-1 "This should make it uses all your cores but one"
With this and an old laptop it took me about 4 days to sync everything.
People never realized that this is why having bigger blocks is a bad idea for now. We need to make sure that the initial sync time of BTC doesn't grow prohibitively long. Otherwise there can be now new nodes meaning no new real BTC user. (In the don't trust verify sense)
We only got one shot at this.
If segwit2x had passed the initial sync time would probably almost be double what it is now. We need to make sure its coomputational time grow at a similar speed as the hardware/software improvement.
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:16:54
dbcache is the size in MB of some in-memory cache. It is especially useful for the initial sync time and also the fast validation of blocks if you are a miner or such. if you are not a miner you can lower back after the initial sync.
Par is the number of validating threads used by the program the more the better but don't use more than the number of virtual cores of your system. (apparently it defaults to using par=-1 no it might not be needed to change it)

Although the paper is well written I cannot recommend enough to watch this video 
Of Poelstra's *presentation. It explains well what is at stakes, where we are now, what are schnorr signatures what changes were necessary to schnorr to create the musig protocol.
They even explain a way how the changes could be made in retrocompatible way.
But in short musig is:
 * Faster check of the signature (algorithm is more efficient)
 * Better privacy (n of m, m of m or regular transaction looks the same) even when the utxo is spent.
 * Way smaller signature and key agregation which means the public keys of the signee aren't revealed and the size of transactions hence the miner fee are smaller.

It's volatile because there is a bidding war going every 10 minutes or so to get in the next block.
If for one reason or the other people are in a hurry to send transactions the bids will go up and so will the fee.

Do you have any solution for that?
I'm thinking about it but I cannot think of one, it seems impossible to force someone who designed a puzzle to forget about the solution.
The closest think I could think of was when one of the main BTC dev created some bounty for hash colision in BTC UTXO.
The solution was not known to the creator and the funds were unlocked by submitting the solution in DATA form to the btc transaction with the right script.
But even that wouldn't work now because it is now impossible to mine a transaction by himself and every mining pool who saw such transaction would replace it by one sending the fund to its own address.
It was Peter Todd

Ideally the customer would be left with 2 choices:
Pay without RBF the recommended satochi/bytes and you can leave with your coffee to go.
Choose a smaller fee am/or RBF and we wait together for a confirmation.
But I only see it working if wallets start accepting a new kind of QR code enclosing the fee rate.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:26:31


That is the opposite of the trustless and decentralized version that I (imho) have for Bitcoin.
And even if that makes it easier to sync it nowadays, the point here is to ensure a future to BTC and making sure that blockchain sync time doesn't grow exponentially.
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:46:23
Alternatively there is this one which I find a little clearer.
Use the 3rd graph (the one in Mb size of the mempool)
Mouseover the right end of the graph and it provides the cumulative distribution of the fee/rate currently in the mempool
right now : 5 or 6 satoshi/bytes.
 
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:58:14
Basically it would work this way:
Right now the limit to be in the next block (with current transaction in the mempool is 4 satochi/bytes)
Pay without RBF those 4 satochi/bytes and you can leave with your coffee to go
Choose a smaller fee am/or RBF and we wait together for a confirmation.

An important point here is the different level of system complexity required between emission of information versus reception.
It is extremely easy and cheap to receive radio wave. long distance emission isn't that trivial. 
I find the fact that radiowave block broadcasting would allow trustless reception of funds already tremendous.

I think an even bigger problem is CPU time.
If the time it takes for a consumer grade CPU to verify the blockchain from scratch keep increasing. (meaning blockchain size grow faster than code optimization and CPU improvement) then in the future this time will be prohibitively too big and prevent the apparition of new node: killing decentralization.

1 Are you working on a mempool based approach for the fee estimation? From my experience they provide the lowest viable fee estimation.
2 RBF would be great
3 From a power user point of view your autmatic batching sounds great but I don't like the idea of a transaction being crafted and modified behind the scene, I think the "Dumb" approach were people would just enter a list of destination addresses and amount would find a bigger public. (again this is purely my intuition). I like to know exactly what is going on regarding fee/change address/ inputs used 
4 Take your time in implementing segwit but do it well, the hardware support with the ledger is top notch. maybe a first step towards segwit could be the support of p2sh segwit HD public key.  
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:43:14
The difference is that your private key was created and never ever leave the hardware wallet (besides your 24 words seed backup you should have written or stamped not digitally).
Your solution can work too but How do you know that the computer you use to encrypt it doesn't run a key-logger or a screengrab.
Regarding which hardware wallet I'm partial of the ledger.
I find the firmware checking of the ledger more relevant than non-tampering sticker used buy trezor.
And like other said before the trezor did show some vulnerabilties that could have results in stolen private keys.

Yes exactly. 
To be fully trustless you have to revalidate the whole blockchain. Meaning you start from the genesis block and revalidate everything from there. The difference with pruning is that you don't keep the old blocks on your hard drive so as long as your limit is something like 5 GB or more it should never be surpassed.

Think of a simple lightning network channel like a private ledger between two party. Where we keep track of our balance together:
 A: 1BTC      B:0BTC
after A paid B 0.5BTC
 A: 0.5BTC      B:0.5BTC
Every transaction between us we multisign a force close transaction (that we don't broadcast which would  send our remaining ammount of BTC to our on chain address, this transaction has a one day delay after being broadcast)
If we close the channel cooperatively ( A and B agree to close the channel)  then we create a new transaction that is valid instantly and use the last state.
If B goes offline and A want to get his BTC back on the main chain he can use the force close transaction... that will take one day to arrive but it doesn't need B to go back online.
If A is malicious and use the first force close transaction (where he still has a full btc) then he gets back the 0.5 btc he paid B.
The security is that there is a delay (usualy a day) for the transaction to be valid on the blockchain and if B prove that the force close transaction wasn't the last one ( by showing the last one) then he gets all of the amount of the channel for himself.

Questions: Which wallet did you use to send the transaction?
Did you set the exact fee amount in sat, or the satochi/byte to 0.4?
Did you send the transaction to your node?a random node? A node you checked didn't have a rule to not relay less than 1 s/byte transaction?
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:19:27
Another issue I haven't seen described to you yet is relative to decentralization. 
In the sense that if you or me want to start a bitcoin full node on the network then we need to start downloading and verifying the whole blockchain. (since we verify everything we don't have to trust anybody). The problem is that the more the blockchain is big the longer it takes to verify it. (took me more than one week a few month ago with a raspberry pi)
To keep this decentralization going we need to make sure that new nodes can appear trustlessly so we need to have the computation time it takes to verify the blockchain on a consumer computer/CPU to grow at the same speed or faster than the blockchain itself.

Benefits of Schnorr over ECDSA: 
 * **Security proof:** The security of Schnorr signatures is easily provable in the random oracle model assuming the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is hard. Such a proof does not exist for ECDSA.
 * **Non-malleability:** ECDSA signatures are inherently malleable; a third party without access to the private key can alter an existing valid signature for a given public key and message into another signature that is valid for the same key and message. This issue is discussed in BIP62. On the other hand, Schnorr signatures are provably non-malleable.[1]
 * **Linearity:** Schnorr signatures have the remarkable property that multiple parties can collaborate to produce a signature that is valid for the sum of their public keys. This is the building block for various higher-level constructions that improve efficiency and privacy, such as multisignatures and others (see Applications below).

Was mycelium rebroadcasting without me asking?
is there some node that purposefully rebroadcast uncofirmed transaction ... (why?)

for this kind of website I would recommend to not to have obfuscated javascript, the small size difference isn't worth it.


 Yes that would work and would definitely be simpler, the server should display its server seed hash, then the client runs random() to create and send his seed. But the client needs to renew and create a new client seed every hand, right now its stayed the same.
The perfect trace in the log should be something like
    script.min.js:1 SERVER SEED HASH for next game is: ff2a91805524abf1563205be12f5f3419a83addecf289a04da2391e58e21e92e5d179f7c85abf0042680e7542aa8193ab9c0aee94a144d18c4776894cc3a8c08

maybe even add those two lines in the log for more transparency

@_date: 2019-05-01 19:21:36
Thinking about it more even my solution is not perfect because in the same way the server could create a master seed that would give the dealer better hands.
Man being provably fair is hard.
So here is my solution, the server would need to display the hash of its master seed before knowing the client seed. Also for the server not to be able to know the client seed it needs to be chosen by the client. 
So in short here is how I think you could make your game perfectly provably fair:
 * The server randomly picks a master key Mk
 * The server display the Hash of its master key hash(Mk)
 * The client randomly mash his numpad keyboard to create a string of character bigger than 32 characters Cstr
 * The truncated hash of Cstr is the client seed for the session Cs
 * The server seed for the first game is a truncated hash of the masterkey + the client seed:  hash(M+Cs)=Ss1
 * we play one game with Cs and Ss1
 * The server seed for the next game is hash(M+Ss1)=Ss2
 * we play one game with Cs and Ss2
 * The server seed for the next game is hash(M+Ss2)=Ss3
 * When the user wants he can request the Master seed M to check the hash matches, this also create a new master seed M2 for the next session.
And Voila

Nope I was referring to the encryption of the "on disk" wallet data. That I could do in setting after creating a wallet.

Hey paper wallets are real bitcoins.
We need another term than "paper bitcoins" "bitcoins IOU".

But even though I would like to trust myself building my own custom airgapped wallet using qr code a camera and an offline raspberry pi signing transaction, I am too paranoiac to trust myself enough not to mess up somewhere. 
Unless you are very good with sand and a soldering iron you will have to place your trust somewhere, be it the chip manufacturers, the developers, even code reviewers if the project is open source.

If you have an old android lying arround you can use 	
Bither - Bitcoin Wallet 
Use the old android that stay in airplane mode and use bither as a cold wallet on it.
You use the real phone as a hot wallet.
When you need the spend BTC you create the transaction on the hot wallet and you scan a qr code with the cold wallet to sign the transaction. 
You scan the new qr code of the signed transaction with the hot wallet.
It is a little complicated but you can easily get the hang of it.
The point is that the private key are inside the old android phone and the online data coming in is unsigned transaction and data coming out is signed transaction.

Theoricaly you gain on fee and on privacy.
The network reduce its utxo size.
But it feel strange because you pay the first guy give him a tx hash, but when you pay a second guy the tx hash will change to a new more confusing transaction.

The migration of my wallet went perfectly fine. 
The derivation path used is the one expected.
Congratulation @_date: 2019-05-01 18:04:10
So the sha512 of my recovery key is 
    3e7aef02af9fb285d6934dbdd03174b9e54dc0ccab428c34a925a9f29ace812fc2e9627b2ae3a602c089cf1ed7d16f64a8a5ee080bc7ec1b152abb96ade9708f
I tried to withdraw my 16250 sats, mybank went to 0 but the lightning invoice wasn't paid...
Also I have a reserve on the provably fair part that maybe we can discuss.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:08:08
I'll play with it once the on chain fees calm down a little.
My first impression is good, interface looks clean.
Encryption should be mandatory (maybe provide a pin option)
The spinning wheel to wait feels a different style than the rest of the app.
Maybe you should display a message to backup the seed at wallet creation too.

!lntip 100 -good banter
In my humble understanding, although the code of the secure element is closed source, all the code handling inputs and outputs of the ledger is open source. (think what goes through the usb cable)
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:11:42
Here is my problem regarding the provably fair part. Although the way you draw cards seems good the fact that there is no information on the way you pick the server seed makes the game not provably fair.
Since the server knows the client seed from the beginning it could try some server seed and only use those who deals Ace or blackjack to the dealer. One way you could fix that is to compute the server seed deterministically like you do the cards. You could reveal at the beginning of a session the hash of a master server seed and for each game the new server seed is the truncated sha512 of (old serverseed + master seed) at the end of a session the user could if he wants to check ask the server for the master seed to check that the hash match and that the history of the server seed was clean and unaltered.

Nice. 


   transaction, new payments will be added to that transaction,
   instead of creating new transactions.
I'm glad this is an opt-in feature, I get this could be helpful for batching but this feels so unnatural.

And you can pay with lightning network on bitrefill !lntip 100
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:17:45
If you receive a big enough tip to warrant a on chain transaction without having a lightning wallet, you can use this exchange [ZigZag]( 
which will allow you without account to paste the lighning payment invoice (that the bot sends you) and your on chain BTC address to receive the funds.

Could that be a way to launder/clean your bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:31:31
!lntip 30 - it is a BTC tip using the lightning network. It is more convenient tu use than on chain transaction as there is almost no fee and transactions takes 2 seconds.

There are visa cards that you can pay back at the end of the month with crypto.

Most of the comments here are about SHA-256 security, the video here talks about 256 bit security, not the SHA-256 algorithm.
This video is more relevant to the brute force hacking of a BTC private key that is 256 bit.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:41:14
Not yours the one who opens and close channel.
But thinking about it more it doesn't work to well to launder as the dirty BTC would sit on the other side of a channel either way and you would need to control both node.
