What’s the market cap of STD at the moment? I must have missed the ICO.

This is "Bitcoin Ticker". I have it on iOS.

Good for you. But 6000£ is hardly life altering.

Firstly, how could you reasonably estimate how many BTC are lost and destroyed? Secondly, do the other currencies include their lost and destroyed coins?
In my opinion the first is a difficult problem, so I understand why they chose not to consider that issue. For the second; I'm quite sure all the currencies include lost and destroyed coins so then the comparison is fair.

I can't believe my retirement plan relies on somebody who says "amazeballs" being right.

I can think of two options for doing this with Bitcoins
(I) give an empty bitcoin wallet now but say that .5 bitcoin etc will be automatically transferred to this wallet when he turns 18. You transfer your 0.5 bitcoin to another wallet today and manually send to his wallet in the future. 
(II) transfer the bitcoins to a wallet, but give only the public address so that the child can watch and monitor how the evaluation changes. Then arrange for the private key to be given on the day of the 18th birthday. 
Honestly, I'm not 100% happy with any of these options.

Frequently one goes directly from one crypto currency to another. Then the software should figure out the conversion so the the user don't need to calculate the dollar exchange rate manually.

There absolutely is a fee, but it’s paid by the shop, not by the user directly. 
It’s not uncommon for shops to refuse payment by credit card if the amount is small, e.g. less than 10€ personally witnessed in shops in Rome, because then the fee may be larger than the profit margin of shop.

The Ledger Blue has Bluetooth connectivity, but that would not help the Nano S

You, sir, are a better man than most. Certainly better than me. ��
