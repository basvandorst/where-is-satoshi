So for the 30 of you that actually fucking spend your Bitcoins and then go trumpet about adoption this is precisely why adoption cannot increase through the normal people community because they look at what it takes to actually use Bitcoin and are immediately turned off because there's no fucking point for them to do it

What does using inflation well look like?

I posted this elsewhere in the thread but the idea that I would take Fiat money to buy Bitcoin and then take Bitcoin to buy gift cards and then take gift cards to buy a thing when I could have cut out those middle two steps in the first place is why Bitcoin is fucking stupid for transactions in First World countries and why all of you guys are morons when you say this
Can we all really please acknowledge where Bitcoin is truly useful and stop making up all this extra bullshit trying to pretend that it's fucking better than it is
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:10:11
Yeah no thanks I'll just use my debit card.  actually USING bitcoin is a fucking hassle that solves precisely zero problems for the average person and only introduces extra steps in the process of transacting

That inflation is necessary for economic growth

The Fed doesnt print money.  Thats the Mint.  If youre going to be an idiot and disregard his central point, I will do the same

What the fuck is a full discount
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:19:29
If you have a better idea on how to manage inflation, I am sure the Fed would love to hear it.
If you think they just say "print 2% more money so we have 2% inflation" you are wrong

We use percentages for a reason you fuckin jackass.  How do you even know what market capitalization is if you do not understand the fundamental logical error you are making

Cool Ill just buy btc with my fiat then buy gift cards with btc then buy sandwiches with gift cards.  THAT IS COMPLETELY REASONABLE

You are continually shifting the conversations focus by introducing additional elements that all have significant levels of complexity. This has two primary effects. The first is continually sidestepping the original main point regarding the value in utility of inflation itself. You concede that inflation is necessary for the growth of the economy, yet maintain a position that is wildly anti-inflation. The second involves the mental gymnastics through which you form arguments resulting in this type of perspective. You are also the kind of person that asks a question not to obtain the answer but to use the question itself as an argument. I would encourage you to actually find the answers to your questions. Though this would require a significant effort at an academic level which I do not suspect you would be willing to undertake given that you are certainly a "self-educated" person.

So the problem with inflation isn't inflation.  Okay well, thanks for agreeing.  If you want to steer the conversation to some anti-central bank bullshit, that's your prerogative but I know better than to play around in the shallow end with the helmet heads.

And this is where you look like a fucking moron. While everyone is entitled to their opinion, some people should keep their opinions to themselves.  If you want to politicize the Fed, you are a moron.
By the way the cognitive dissonance that exists in the opinions you express is phenomenal. You clearly concede that inflation itself is not the problem yet you continually claim that it is a massive tax on people.  So which one is it? Is inflation a tool for encouraging economic growth? Or is it a burdensome tax that is used by those in power to maintain control over those at the bottom?

Fucking god damnit thank you.  One of the biggest turn offs to crypto is the community.  I am glad to see at least a few of you have a god damn clue
