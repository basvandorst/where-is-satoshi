The address is correct yes, do you mean my bitcoin wallet address should be in the transaction ID?
@_date: 2016-03-15 06:02:39
They're very handy reads and websites thank you for your time man!

I never had the resources to earn BTC, I never could afford a computer to mine, maybe i'm missing the point here but that's the only way I thought I could earn the coins. It's clear to see i'm not too clued up on bitcoins so to my knowledge I thought it was nearly impossible now to mine coins so the only way I could obtain them would be to buy or invest? If you could show me some other ways to obtain bitcoins I'd be highly appreciative.
Thank you.

That's a good point, if the price were to sky rocket I would only be annoyed that I didn't have any!
@_date: 2016-03-14 10:34:13
Thank you very much for your help it is really appreciated!
I'll look into these apps and hopefully give it a go, I understand what you're saying and you are completely correct there is no way to know if its too late to buy so hopefully I'm making a good decision and wont end up losing all the money I work for, thank you for your time friend!

Thank you for your response.
So if I was to buy bitcoins where would you recommend I buy them, or does that not really matter? And is it easy to just transfer them to a mobile  wallet? I'd mainly do all my buying and trading from my phone as I do most things from there anyway.

Thank you very much for your help mate, I'll check out the article now!
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:05:35
Wow, thanks dude! Saved me there, Can I ask how come the official bitcoin website promotes cloud mining through genesis mining?
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:46:04
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:39:14
That's good to know thank you
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:30:51
Yeah I realised that everyone here wants the price to go up so they'd all tell me now is a good time, thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:45:21
What makes you say that?

Is mining not worth while at all? or is it just at this time? If I was to buy a rig to mine with It wouldn't just be for the sole purpose of mining it would also be for everyday daily use &amp; I know I wouldn't mine a lot from a rig like this but It would be some steady money?
@_date: 2016-03-15 05:57:57
Thank you! I'm gonna stick to only spending a small amount of my income on them and go from there
@_date: 2016-03-14 10:37:19
Thank you for your advice, its more than likely that I too will only have modest amounts of BTC because although I'm earning a steady wage from my job the coins are still a bit expensive for the amount I'm earning so I wont have a lot of coins maybe only a couple I think it was working out around £400 per coin when I was looking so its' a lot of money for me to invest
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:58:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-03-15 12:56:34
I did wonder how a cloud mining company could offer me a one of payment plan and in return give me a daily income and I have thought this to be slightly fishy if you were, if you don't mind could you elaborate as to why this is a scam just so I can back up why it is when friends ask me?
Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:24:24
Ok, thanks for your help.
@_date: 2016-03-15 06:04:32
I've got it wrote down in one safe place at the moment and I'll make sure to back it up and keep it in more safe places around my house, thanks dude 
@_date: 2016-03-14 10:11:59
Thank you for your help!
When you say don't use an exchange or web wallet to store my coins does this mean use either a wallet on my phone or download one to my PC? Preferably I'd like an app that is safe to keep my coins in and buy/trade coins so I could do it all on my phone as I spend a lot of my time on the move.
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:18:18
Thank you, I've just started actually, I'm using bread wallet for my wallet and localbitcoins to trade! Hopefully I can make some money haha
@_date: 2016-03-14 10:22:52
Thank you very much!
I was un-aware that I could use different apps to trade and for a wallet I thought it all had to be done on one app.
How does this work then do I just trade on one and then send them to my wallet is there like a serial number for my wallet or something that I'd use to put my coins from the trading app to the wallet?
Sorry if that's a bit confusing I'm new to this, from what I have understood from yourself is that it is not too late to start buying bitcoins? As i'm sure you're aware i'm looking into this for financial gain is this still possible or have I missed the boat?
Thanks dude!
@_date: 2016-03-15 06:03:03
That's actually really good! Thank you for your help
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:59:38
Yeah, It would probably cost more than its worth to try and start mining myself I think i'll just stick to buying them outright and hope they increase in price!
@_date: 2016-03-14 09:58:31
How would I control the private keys? It seems I need to do a lot more researching and learning.
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:39:23
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:00:03
Yeah that is a fair point, thanks man
@_date: 2016-03-14 10:31:39
Thank you for your help!
If you don't mind me asking what is it you do to work for these bitcoins? I am intrigued on how I could work for bitcoins as I think that would be a cool idea!
And so you're saying there is around 4 million BTC left to enter the circulation? Does this mean you think it would be a good idea for me to look to try and obtain some?
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:43:11
Does this work in the UK? I checked it out and it mainly seemed to work for american workers
@_date: 2016-03-14 11:23:29
Thank you very much makes me feel better about starting up
@_date: 2016-03-14 12:55:56
Really? What makes you say that? Do you think they're going to go up soon?
@_date: 2016-03-15 05:58:39
Thanks for the advice I've got it wrote down in a safe place at the moment and I'll write it down in other places aswell for a back up 
@_date: 2016-03-15 06:05:23
Haha I'll give it a go
@_date: 2016-03-14 10:10:04
Like I mentioned earlier I'd like to be able to do everything from my iPhone, is there any way off doing this? So is there any sites that offer a wallet of my own where I can control my Keys and be able to buy/sell the coins through that one app, I've seen a few people mention mycelium and I was wondering if that would fulfill what I was looking for?
Again thank you for your time and help.
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:58:35
Thank you, I'll put a bit of money into it over the coming weeks and see how it goes.
@_date: 2016-03-15 06:03:54
Thank you for your help! Appreciated
@_date: 2016-03-15 06:05:15
That's what I'm thinking of doing, set aside a percentage of my weekly wage to gain a few bits and then hopefully they'll increase over time 
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:38:56
i'm new to all of this so is there any more information you can give me about the "Halvening" in July?
@_date: 2016-03-14 10:18:43
Thank you very much! Ill keep researching I don't want to make any rash decisions and end up regretting everything at the minute MyCelium seems like It could offer everything I'm looking for.
Again thank you and have a nice day!!
@_date: 2016-03-14 15:14:26
Thank you for your help, I'm going to budget a small amount from my wages to invest and hopefully spin a profit in the future.
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:12:50
Gah, That's awful :(
