My coins lost 1/3rd of their value in TWO months and this is happening?
I'm out. I consider myself lucky I didn't lose everything. No one is going to adopt something that loses 1/3 of it's value in 2 months and can't be held in useful place without a high risk of being stolen.
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:52:16
oops we just lost 5 million dollars! Oh well though right? Too the moon!
I pulled out today and I am never coming back. What the hell kind of currency drops 1/3 in value in two months? At least you can explain why the ruble is falling. Nonsense speculators screwing with the value of the coin constantly. I bet on good news shoring up the price. It did the opposite. Now something bad happens and it holds. What the fuck?
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:11:43
I had not only not been around then, but I felt like a lot of positive news was coming around. I also had some places in my area that I could actually use it.

That's funny. I swear I've seen this post many times. But... The support line keeps getting flatter.

As someone who works in public health, specifically trash:
FUCK Occupy wallstreet. It was a disgrace on that regard.

If online wallets dont work then bitcoin doesn't work. End of story. It has to be easy. Posts like this give me grave concerns. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:09:47
Thanks dude. As if the millions of dollars in thefts and uncertainty didn't influence my decision.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:33:28

Put your money in vanguard IRA index funds. Even though you're 25-35 years old. 
Is it better then holding cash? Yes. Is it smart? Not if you want to change economic classes.

Stiglitz is a Georgist who doesn't believe in private land ownership and assumes the government cannot act in a corrupt manner, which is why many of this theories fall apart with socio-political criticism. 
What did anyone expect? He's highly intelligent and respected. But he's also an ideologue.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:22:02
It's just not risky. Risk sucks, but it's not going to do much besides provide for a retirement. Maybe. Possibly. 
I like riskier investments.

How is that an ad hominem attack? 
There are piles of books, papers and articles which heavily criticize his work.


How is that ad hominem?


He is by definition an ideologue. He adheres to a rigid school of economic thought. "Stiglitz is a Georgist who doesn't believe in private land ownership and assumes the government cannot act in a corrupt manner".

No cock gobbler.
The recent thefts spooked me pretty hard. I also still have trouble embracing a Currency that's super volatile. The whole point of currency is stability.

Bitcoin is an emergent property. We simply don't know what it CAN do fully yet. Or how it will ultimately change our society.
At the most fundamental level, I think it will replace gold. Which is awesome.
