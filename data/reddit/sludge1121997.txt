Last I checked a backlog of 178k transactions is a lot. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:59:33
I hope it does. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:36:28
What solution do I have? I have contacted the website and they said it might take a week or so and they would make sure it gets through. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:24:03
I have no idea how but the transaction got confirmed. Thank you for your help.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:12:47
Will give it a shot, would have to read a bit. Any useful links would be great. Thank you.

Is there any way I could pay some extra fees and get the transaction through?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:05:58
Already tried it, says fees too low.

Do you have any idea how long that would take?

The thing is I don’t have the private keys so it isn’t really possible for me to CPFP 
Also I requested this as a payout via a website and was receiving it to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:38:43
It’s really irritating that there is nothing I can do about it. Also I get it via btc works for the community and all but if my transaction had enough fees why would I want to accelerate it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:32:36
Also how is it begging when I’m asking for a solution and am ready to pay for it? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:02
Pretty sure almost all regular followers of r/Bitcoin have seen the price on the first page lmao.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:38
I'm pretty sure it wasn't. I am totally in love with Bitcoin but paying $3 fees on transactions is kinda hurting me a bit these days.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:07:06
I do know CPFP but like can I do it for an address which I don't control the private keys? The address to which the money is sent to is an exchange.

HODL what you can afford to lose. Corrected that for you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:30:12
I did try via btc but it says fees too low 
I tried confirm TX with no luck 
BTC.com is charging me $300 for a $260 transaction 
Do you know anymore? 
I was able to find out BTCspeedy which charges $10 but is probably a scam.

Hope for the best.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:26:55
Thank you so much :) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:29:54
TBH I invested what I was willing to lose since I am just learning about bitcoin. Also a 5% change didn't affect me a lot, I am just trying to understand and learn when to invest and when not to.
Edit: HODL for life.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:25:47
I was waiting to buy them from a week or so but some of my friends said 3.3k was an ath and I should not buy them. Now, I was so excited to invest that I thought it would rise and end up at 5k. This is why I bought them at an ath.
Also thank you for your advice, I am using a Paper Wallet imported  on blockchain.info.

Only if you want to sell them, yes it needs to verify your documents. Probably abiding by legal rules and regulations. A company won't be able to operate if it doesn't abide by the rules.

Well, you only have to pay tax on your profits.
