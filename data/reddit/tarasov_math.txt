You talking theoretically.  During civil disorder, civil wars and wars, you need some weapon only to protect from bandits. Group of people usually can more or less enough weapons. Anyway weapon will not protect you from any serious. In other hand,  matches soap and salt are necessary for everybody every day. They are compact and easy to store. Russians had a lot of survival practice during 20 century andcknow it very well. May be you can change matches into lighters and salt into some modern conservant, but I am not sure.

Brass and lead? It will not help you to survive at all. Every Russian knows: soap, salt, matches. Also cereals and canned goods.

You can became bandit,  but its one way road, and usually finish by dearth or prison, even during civil disorder. Most people do not like thiscway and prefer matches. But some people going this way.

Negative percents are quite normal thing. I think in future will be safe bitcoin sotrages also with negative percents. It is just pay for safety.
