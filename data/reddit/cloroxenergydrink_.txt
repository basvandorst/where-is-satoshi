Around £5 back in around 2015 lol. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

I’m honestly sceptical of this but if it actually did happen then definitely do get the police involved.

Plot twist that thing is worth 6.15 BTC
@_date: 2019-08-31 05:38:57
Why get 6.15, just get 6.16 and that'll piss him off.

For starters I think you should create a paper wallet in an offline environment as you have your own private key untouched by companies. If you don’t own the private key, it’s not your wallet. Also consider getting a hardware wallet.

Still underrated.
@_date: 2019-08-24 02:06:15
Man that’s such a scummy move.
@_date: 2019-12-18 01:35:59
Bitcoin founder. Lol.
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:11:19
You’re new aren’t you?

Welcome aboard. Don’t panic when it drops and just go with the flow. Consider getting a hardware wallet too, especially if you are planning on holding great amounts. Make sure you hold the private keys to your wallets.
@_date: 2019-12-29 13:31:05
Yeah that would be interesting.

Instead of going around saying OK boomer to others I’m gonna have to suggest you to rethink your crypto choices right there. You shouldn’t trust organisations that are not 100% open-source as crypto in the first place is about anonymity, transparency, security, and reciprocity. If Exodus cannot fully be open-source then stay away from it. Use a hardware wallet to ensure fully secure storage.

I doubt it will be a problem. You don’t require super high internet speed in order to run a full node. Just go for it.

Lmao Tether. Great job making the video lol.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:05:16
Holy shit. Good luck. Not all heroes wear capes.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:06:23
You're awesome. Keep it up.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:20:59
I'd say sell a portion of it since you need the cash. It is not 100% confirmed that Bitcoin will dip soon, so just hold the rest until it blows up straight towards the moon.
@_date: 2018-03-24 11:42:03
Fuck the Fed. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:04:41
I'm definitely paying with Bitcoin if I ever get on your bus. Great work btw.
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:23:24
This is one hell of a rollercoaster ride.
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:27:01
Username checks out.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:42:14
Aye nice!
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:11:43
Very nice! Props to you for the hard work. Keep it up.

I’m sceptical. Did you randomly put $5M into your bank account out of nowhere and still have no one to ask you about anything regarding it?
