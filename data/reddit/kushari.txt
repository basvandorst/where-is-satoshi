It doesn't take months to get verified for any level. It depends on people's luck. I was approved for one exchange to a higher level in literally a few hours. So many factors depend on how fast you get verified. It might have been true in your case, but there's no standard approval time.

Whereas with BTC, you could be in the hole 40% or up 100% incredible amounts of volatility, is not responsible. Why do you think people say, only put in as much as you're willing to lose, but don't say the same thing for a house?

99% (a number I made up) of malware is for Windows pcs. The likelyhood that it would infect a mac are very low. Also pwn2own are people that are sitting there actively trying to find new security holes, so the likelyhood that they find one is high and then it usually gets closed soon after. Where as websites that distribute malware will usually use already known exploits. Two very different things.

You’re basically running a node on the network. Which means you will be helping the bitcoin network. You don’t really get any reward per say, like you would if you mined. But to mine, you need to invest money, effort, spend lots on electricity etc. running a node just add another computer to the network to verify and help distribute the ledger.

You're absolutely wrong. Electric cars have half the emissions tail end to tail end, if you're using coal. And I'm in Canada, most of our electricity is renewable, so it's close to 0 after the car is made. Might want to watch this:

Fuck, why does the hydrogen argument keep coming up. It’s pointless, it’s being pushed by big oil. It’s not efficient, most of the time it’s made using gas, so it’s not clean anyway. Electric cars are no where near as bad as gas or hydrogen. Read my other replies in this thread I can’t keep posting the same information. And for the coal argument check out the YouTube video Adam fails to ruin Tesla. I’m in Canada and our power is mostly renewable, so 0 impact. An electric car gets cleaner as the grid gets cleaner. Hydrogen not so much in most cases and even if it does it’s a huge loss of efficiency. Gas cars not possible to get cleaner.

I actually like the interface. Easy to see all balances while trading, without going to another page. Their infrastructure sucks, and maybe it's not coded well?
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:24:34
All your points are moot. The charging network, they've mentioned other brands can use it if they pitch in. So far no one has taken them up on it. Why should Tesla invest 200 Million dollars and allow others to congest their network, and use the electricity they pay for? And as I mentioned before in this thread, name another car that you can upgrade after you've bought it? None. You'd have to sell it and lose a lot of money and buy the better one. The 60 (which isn't offered anymore anyway) allows people to get into a Tesla for cheaper, and upgrade when/if they have the money later. It offers flexibility. Remember Tesla doesn't owe you a discount.

It's not anticonsumer. They don't owe you a discount. They are offering you A at price A, if you don't like it don't buy it. They are then offering you B at price B. What other car can you upgrade after you've bought it? None.

It's not scummy. It's actually pretty awesome. First of all it's not all the cars, it was the newer 60 versions that were software locked 75s. The reasons for this are as following. It lowers manufacturing costs because you have less variations of the product. Secondly it allows people to buy a Tesla for cheaper and then upgrade later when they have the money. What other car can you get a smaller engine and then upgrade after you've bought it? None. You'd have to sell the car, lose a lot of money, and then re buy the one with the bigger engine. It's actually a great thing for people, highers their resale value.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:25:28
That’s not the point. If you get into an accident, they will find out. Not worth the risk. I made .001 of a bitcoin but insurance didn’t pay out for my totaled car. Sounds like a great idea to me.

That’s incorrect, because I have a 1Gbps connection and it was starved and downloading slowly. So that’s one point debunked. Also this is from 2016. A lot has happened in the space since then, especially the attack from bch and forks etc. That’s like linking to an article about gas cars, 10 years from now when all cars are electric and making claims based on those old facts. Which mentioned in your link, security of the network, not the security of the person running it. It seems you can’t read, and are stupid. If my internet connection didn’t have an issue finding nodes to saturate the connection to download I would have downloaded the entire ledger in an hour or two. It’s been downloading for the last 4 hours. Again you have no idea what you’re talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:21:58
Email them and let them know, this will make them care more. I did. The more people that move their money out and specifically tell them why, makes the more likely to invest into actually fixing the issue rather than apologizing every time you're pissed at them.

That report is based on old bullshit or old information that wasn't updated. Watch the video for more correct and updated info. Even look at the link the damn article references and highlight Battery electric vehicles, it's the lowest emissions on the website. 
I don't know if you know this, but there are a lot of interests paying for articles against electric cars and specifically Tesla. There's a lot of FUD and outdated facts. Google how the Koch brothers are paying 10M dollars to have articles written about electric cars being bad. Also batteries can be recycled endlessly. So once the damage is done once, it’s done mostly.

That site was referenced by one of the articles someone wrote to me about the same thing you did and it clearly shows battery electric as being the lowest emissions in its lifetime. It’s from MIT.

@_date: 2019-01-03 16:40:52
Oh ok, Linux is good. For btc I’d go for the bitcoin core wallet (original core developers). Website is bitcoin.org. Don’t trust anyone including me, so don’t copy paste that as pshishers use characters that look like letters but are not that letter like a c with a dot on top etc. so I say type in the address yourself, never copy paste from Reddit or a website. Same for eth official website is ethereum.org. These wallets are not light wallets, so you’ll have to download the entire blockchain. The bitcoin one is close to 200GB, but they are the best wallets from a security perspective. Also as soon as you install the wallet, encrypt it from the options menu with a strong password, don’t forget that password as you won’t be able to use the wallet. But encrypting it right away makes it so there are no copies of the wallet that can be used to send your funds anytime. Because if I get a copy of your wallet file before you encrypt it. Doesn’t matter if you encrypt it later, I have your seed, and don’t have encryption and can send your funds.

Again not possible to arbitrage. Happened too fast to move from one place to another.

Quick question: If a business accepts bitcoins doesn't the fluctuation have the potential to really lower the income? Sorry not sure how to word that correctly, but hopefully someone will understand what I mean.

Just wondering what you meant about kicking people off, at 51%?

Quick question. It was crashing when I was confirming my orders. Does the status change to *processing* after you accept?

Yeah, so it's a gamble really. That's what I thought. But just wondering why a business would under go that? I guess because they believe in bitcoin and want to support it's growth, which eventually would help stabilize it more.

Isn't it cyanogenmod telling you that?

Why would they do so?
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:57:59
I mean in terms of everyday things. Like taking a payment you know. But yeah I know they take large risks.
