Gemini really use uncompressed public keys? Wow. They were founded years after public key compression became the norm for Bitcoin transactions, there's really no excuse for that.

Space might be cheap, but IOPS aren't. Syncing the blockchain with a mechanical hard disk is already painful. If any chain ever goes above say about 30-50 tx/sec you can completely forget about trying to run a node from one, maybe even lower, because you won't be able to update the transaction database fast enough to keep up. Ethereum is already having some issues with this.

Anything that low was probably pushed out of the memory pool of most nodes by all the higher-fee transactions, so you might be able to get away with abandoning it and broadcasting a new transaction spending the same inputs with a higher fee.

I'm not convinced this was just normal traffic. The average transaction size in the 100-120 satoshis/byte stripe seems unusually high and I'm not sure why that should be.

Think about it this way: if you sell 20% now and the price goes to the moon, you'll only lose out by about 20%. If you don't sell now and it plummets you'll lose 99% of your savings. There's a reason theymos suggests rebalancing your portfolio on big price increases like this.

Last I heard, Bitcoin has the second highest transaction volume of all the cryptocurrencies that are at all decentralised, and the number one is Etherium which is having its own capacity issues. It's possible that others could do better but we really don't know right now.

I'm not sure what's going on with BTC/GBP, but there's no way to deposit or withdraw GBP to GDAX for quite some time now so you should probably be using BTC/EUR which is available in the UK.

Remember, a block size increase requires writing software too, and it had better be done right because we're pretty limited in what can be done to change it after it's deployed. The last attempt to increase it (Segwit2x) was rushed and had bugs that would've caused a fair amount of chaos and disruption if it wasn't called off at the last minute. Plus doing so requires everyone to upgrade. If we can't even get SegWit developed, deployed and in widespread use, we certainly shouldn't consider a block size increase to be a feasible alternative.

Every working BCH wallet and client has to have about half of a working SegWit implementation in it, plus a couple of dubious and poorly-specified difficulty algorithm changes. Some of them inevitably screwed this up.

Worse, he thinks that this ability to reach into people's pockets and take their money away is a feature: "Currently, the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates during tough economic times, but the Fed is practically limited at the zero bound because it is difficult to impose negative interest rates (regardless of whether that would be good policy). Suppose bonds were issued with a negative interest rate of 2 percent, making it expensive for investors to hold them. Who would buy them? Why not hold cash, which has a zero percent interest rate? With a national cryptocurrency, whose supply is controlled by the central bank, rates can be negative."

No-one seems to be using it though... transaction volume's been much lower than Bitcoin, except for briefly when Coinbase announced support and it reached the same kind of volume as Bitcoin for a day or two.

If the superior, high-capacity alternative to Bitcoin being pushed is IOTA - which is not only centralized and a security trainwreck but currently collapsing under its own scaling problems, because the developers handwaved the issue of how well it would actually scale - then that kind of does matter.

Just temporarily upgrade every node to change the Bitcoin consensus rules in a way that's never been done before? Yeah, that's not really an option, and even if it were possible there's not really any fast way to do it. Block size increases pretty much have to be a long term thing.
In the short term, more SegWit adoption would probably solve the immediate problems and be a lot easier to carry out. That doesn't require everyone to upgrade, just a reasonably-sized minority of the people producing the transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:07:28
Given the timing, it's likely that a lot of the transaction volume was caused by speculation related to the recent price increases. That isn't healthy or sustainable in the long run and it was horribly disruptive to anyone wanting to use Bitcoin for anything else, such as actually buying stuff. Once the rapid doubling stopped and all the speculators willing to pay tens or hundreds of dollars per transaction went away after pricing out the normal users, what would we be left with?

Stop loss orders have their downsides in markets as volatile as Bitcoin. Suppose you bought in at around $10k a few days ago and set up a stop-loss order at $8k. The flash crash a few days back down to $7.5k would've liquidated your position for a loss at around $8k, and the fact that the price recovered fairly rapidly would be no consolation to you at all.

Bitstamp seem to use some kind of custom transaction processing setup that uses multisig addresses for deposits, even before they added Segwit support. The discount is also bigger for multisig so they had more incentive to add support.

Dollar cost averaging works a hell of a lot better than tossing everything in at the all-time high.

The trading volumes reported between BCH and Korean won are astounding. I did the math and it worked out to be equal to about half the entire economic output of South Korea over the same time period. Someone over on r/btc claims that Bithumb offers zero trading fees to some customers, which might explain it. In any case you should take those figures with a giant grain of salt.
Also, I believe that Bitfinex's "USD" (4th largest volume right below the Koreans) is actually USDT in practice because it can only be withdrawn in the form of USDT right now. There's supposedly some evidence that Tether is owned and operated by Bitfinex too.

Obviously the SegWit transactions don't get verified by old nodes that don't know about SegWit transactions, just like P2SH transactions didn't get verified by old nodes back when those were introduced. As far as nodes which support SegWit are concerned though the witness data is just as much a part of the block as all the other transaction data, and there's a commitment to the contents of the witness data in the scriptsig which ensures it's fixed at the point when the block is mined and cannot be changed.

Even for SPV wallets, since they're meant to check the difficulty rules. This was one of the things that made the BCH fork more difficult to carry out in the first place.

The GDAX BTC/EUR market is at about 8.750 € right now, whereas the GDAX BTC/USD market is at $9600 which converts to right around 8.041€. I have no idea why, but it's been going on all day to some extent.

It's impossible for mere mortals to deposit USD on Bitfinex, so that's probably why.

The only thing they validate is that some miner was willing to include the transactions to them in a block. For all they know, the miners could've conjured those coins from nowhere or stolen them from Satoshi himself without a valid signature; SPV nodes have no way to tell. They're effectively 100% reliant on full nodes, and ultimately on miners.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:42:18
You're stretching the definition of peer-to-peer past the breaking point here, I think. SPV nodes rely on full nodes to do pretty much all of the hard lifting: finding relevant transactions, validating them, checking if they're part of the longest valid chain, validating and rebroadcasting any transactions the SPV nodes create. SPV nodes don't provide any kind of services to any other nodes; they don't help with forwarding blocks and transactions to other nodes like all full nodes do, because they can't validate those blocks and transactions in any meaningful way. It's a pure client-server model.
