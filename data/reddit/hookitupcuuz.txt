Lmao. How? Very few alts are traded against ETH currently. 
Right now the means for measure is BTC since that is what the majority is being traded against. The best gains are when you’re not hoping for your own proposed future and working off what is happening at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:21:16
Not to mention ALTs are traded against BTC. If BTC had no worth, ALTs would be significantly worth much less to the dollar amount.

Solid meme coin that has potential. No real use, but could still be worth alot like how collectable trading cards can be worth alot now a days. It could earn me money but I consider DOGE more of a gamble coin than a guaranteed coin. I use the word guaranteed in terms of a single trade, not long term profits.
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:07:16
I’m very selective with my choice of alts. I accredit them for part of the reason I have a tenth. Trading has only been a success for me so I plan to stick with it.
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:02:15
Thanks my man I’ve been arguing with them ALL day. Overall I’m happy with myself.
@_date: 2019-11-16 07:27:10
Why are you against alt coins? They brought me significant profit so far. They have a purpose too and offer different forms of the blockchain for different purposes.
@_date: 2019-11-09 23:54:24
Oh so you just know everything about me huh? Please do tell me more about myself.

It’s an app in the app store. Check it out. I’m currently googling all the information I can on it.
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:04:32
The fuck? You’re actually going to assume someone has a mental illness over the internet? You got some shit wrong with YOU not me. I pay bills. I have payments. I can’t afford to throw money at Bitcoin every check. I consider myself successful because I traded myself part of the way up to where I am with my investments. How is this a joke? It’s not where you start, it’s about where you end.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:48:30
What’s so good about CHZ. I was checking it out for a possible pump and dumb but unless it’s some ground breaking technology I probably wouldn’t invest long term into it.

You’re spot on.
@_date: 2019-11-09 21:57:12
For short term trades yes if I’m day trading, depending on the trends and graphs determines if I make a trade or not. So yes I CAN but I’m not going to.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:54:07
That’s one alt I have really checked into actually. My apologies.
@_date: 2019-11-09 21:49:56
You do understand that you make mere dollars only trading $500? I have .1 Bitcoin but that’s not all my money.

@_date: 2019-11-09 13:24:34
I don’t consider crypto a gamble, I consider it a currency and store of wealth. If I wanted to throw away money I would go to the casino. I am an experienced trader bud. Trading isn’t gambling. It’s learning how to read graphs, trends, news, numbers. If I felt as if it was a gamble I wouldn’t be trading. Apparently luck IS on my side, no scratch that, skill and knowledge is. 
With your logic walking down the street is a gamble now a days, you can get shot, hit by a car, etc,  or is it just sub conscious paranoia over factors you have no control over.
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:11:16
Thank you!

No I pay my own bills.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:01:16
Why? I’m ecstatic. Nobody could figure out any real life details about me. I’m not paranoid like some others I read on here. I know what I’m doing. Is someone going to waste their time to hack my shit which no reddit user can do to get information they can’t use? Makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-11-10 01:58:26
I’m actually in college.
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:02:40
In time my friend. Bills come first.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:47:13
No. Don’t plan on it until they come knocking on my door.
@_date: 2019-11-11 01:59:19
You understand that I work and pay bills and I trade because I watch the market 24/7 right?

$880. No I didn’t.

About a year and a half. I use Binance because the fees are low so you can actually make profit whereas with Coinbase Pro(GDAX) their fees are extremely high and almost negate any profit you would make. Now I buy the bitcoin through Coinbase then transfer it into Binance to trade.
@_date: 2019-11-07 02:39:19
How much on average did you earn?
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:02:12
I think the bull is getting ready
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:10:37
Did you not read what I just said? Trading and alts are the reason I even have a tenth. I’ve only had success with minor losses.
@_date: 2019-11-10 01:47:52
The fact you’re still replying and not losing weight like your fat ugly ass should be doing.
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:25:39
Absolutely. Will probably be up about 300%. There’s alt coins then shit coins. I don’t buy shit coins. I buy alts.
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:00:58
I have a job. Stop assuming things.
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:00:55
No shit... huh wow everyone must be born rich by this subreddits standards.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:15:09
Yes that is right. Do you know how much you make when you trade amounts less than $1,000? Dollars. Mere dollars. If you get lucky with the price you might make $10 on a rare day, but most trades under $1,000 make you dollars. Now I probably made $3-400 through trading and bought the rest so mind you I was only trading with $500.
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:52:10
Thank you my friend. I wish more people would learn. Don’t get me wrong when I first started trading I had no idea what I was doing and lost some, but at that time I was only trading small amounts, money that I WOULD gamble with and take to the casino, money I’m not afraid to lose.
Overtime, after staring at graphs for days, watching the market, and the most important step, removing emotion, I begin to have success. I self taught myself how to trade crypto currency successfully. I make sure to take the guaranteed trade with smaller profit than the risky one with higher profit. It has worked every time for me.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:08:36
You are correct. Thank you for posting this reply.

You’re a fucking idiot. Nobody can figure anything out about me. Nothing personal is attached to my reddit and nobody is going to waste their time for $900 to go through the trouble of getting personal information with two step verifications they can’t use. Go get some medication for your paranoia or something I don’t deal with your kind.

Still can’t identify me.
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:16:59
Your kind act like everyone loses when trading or buying alts. Your kind are wrong. I have been successful, do you know what that word means? At any point I don’t feel comfortable trading or I begin to suffer loses I will quit, until then the best advice is do what makes you happy (and money) which for me is trading. I know how to read graphs. I don’t make any unpredictable trades or gambles. Shouldn’t have to defend my actions to your kind. 
Who are you to say if I am experienced or not? You don’t know me. I do so happen to be a experienced trader albeit I’ve practiced with smaller amounts for over a year.
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:13:47
Well like other commentators have said “Don’t let the haters get to you and keep doing you” which I’m going to do because profit no matter how big or how small is still profit and success. The crypto market is a gift compared to the stock market. Much more volatile therefore easier to make money. 
You can go elsewhere and attack someone else.
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:57:47
Success isn’t valued nor measured in money. It’s actually more like $980. If you knew anything about crypto (which you obviously don’t even know the price of bitcoin otherwise you would not have said $800 you would have said $900 something) you would know that a tenth rounds up to about $900 plus. 
Do you know how much you make when you trade amounts less than $1,000? Dollars. Mere dollars. You know nothing about trading.
What I consider success is that I kept earning those dollars over and over which hence is why I have a tenth now. You should educate yourself on trading crypto currency more.

@_date: 2019-06-22 14:29:01
I don’t think it’s going below 8.5k but it’s definitely pulling back sooner than later. Can’t go up without going down. Like Ying and Yang but for trading.

That’s anytime amirite?
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:15:21
Yes coinbase is actually one of if not the most trustworthy exchange. And yes one Bitcoin is now worth $11k USD.

All mine came from 7-9k so I’m in the clear, still interesting af to watch
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:03:05
Because the price is above where I bought
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:34:45
You can keep it on Coinbase you will be fine. I don’t use wallets so I can’t recommend you one. My apologies.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:31:46
up it looks like
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:34:16
You’re in the clear if you’re above what you bought at. You’re telling me things I already know.
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:00:00
I already know that but where can I print them out into stickers?
@_date: 2019-06-13 05:09:03
I’m only located on Coinbase for the moment. Haven’t felt the need for storage elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:23:03
only in the UK
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:02:34
shhh don’t tell nobody

@_date: 2019-05-10 15:33:42
I have the same question.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:54:45
Coinbase is your best bet.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:30:07
I think it will drop once more then settle around $10k.
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:52:46
I wouldn’t say another year or lower lows. It’s already at its adjustment price from the last bull run. If anything it steadys around $10k and slowly moves up towards $20k.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:23:04
Even if I only keep it on an exchange for a couple hundred? Doesn’t make sense.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:35:30
It’s kind of like electric cars and replacing fossil fuels to compare it. Replacing paper money with something completely digital. Either way I see it being worth enough to sell a good amount at some point. It’s just something that’s always going to have worth no matter what happens to it. Especially when it is implemented to have use with mobile devices somehow. It can really be used any way. It’s another currency at this point. Until the internet dies Bitcoin won’t.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:08:19
Good question
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:17:01
Your best bet at least with what it’s doing RIGHT now would be to HODL. Wait for it to be more steady before choosing to sell.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:09:56
I think it will steady at this price for a while, then jump up to about 10k in another month. Even if it dumps it will just return at some point.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:50:00
Definitely helps, thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:01:49
Same question

Do what he said. My stash got smaller and smaller at first.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:46:08
Interesting, thanks. I don’t make that much right now but just for later.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:00:36
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:08:40
Sell to USD. Unless you want to avoid tax.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:36:49
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:24:09
if you’re talking about actual crypto, there is multiple things on the internet that you can and I wait until it’s implemented in more places eventually. investing in the possible future it could have down the road is what most people do.
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:40:17
what’s all this mean and what’s it for
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:10:24
Correct to what? 10k? 20k?
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:45:47
If you can afford the worst case scenario, yes.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:13:51
this was perfectly said
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:55:53
We’ll get it there.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:29:03
That’s such a small amount it’s not worth it. If you insist try coinbase.
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:45:39
Definitely not $100k but I’d say it could reach $20k again
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:41:12
bullish means up, not down
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:20:17
That’s what I had originally thought. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:16:58
I mean hey we broke $20k...
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:06:22
About what I’m expecting.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:32:28
Essentially yes.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:47:45
Oo, I make nowhere near that much, not enough to report then. I do keep some log work but other than that I don’t keep much around.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:24:46
