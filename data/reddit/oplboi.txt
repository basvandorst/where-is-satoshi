You can still buy in now its not like it isnt going to rise a lot more.

You're so mad about people making money ahaha. I wont lie the numbers have dropped a tiny amount but still making a lot more than you say.

I've never seen someone get so jealous over something like this. If you can't afford to buy an S9 okay but don't go crying to other people and saying they're shit.

You really are a wasteman ahaha. Do you need me to take pictures of the profit we're making?

You're simply jealous that you can't have one so you try and put other people off of buying them. However I have also amended the numbers as they have gone done slightly in the last few days which you're not taking in. Now please stop replying to me I don't like jealous people.

When I first made my blockchain account it took a day to get the email so i'd day dont panic.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:46:24
Dude i am telling you what i see... The numbers don't lie.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:31:27
I've seen the daily earnings... You're clueless pal. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:19:07
It's making over £1k a month right now.

My parents wont stop asking about it now. Having to explain the risk and that it isn't a get rich quick scheme. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:48:18
I went in last week when it was at all time high felt like an idiot but i also managed to go in at pretty much the bottom of the dip. However now even though I went in at the all time high it has surpassed that now and I am in profit even from that. Lesson so far is that it will always go back up. Just be prepared to see it go down. If you can't lose the money don't take the risk.

Yes we have an S9 at work running on no electric cost and its making good money, probably over £10k Profit in a year if it stays at the rate it is mining.

@_date: 2017-11-17 10:23:43
Please go get a job, save up for an S9 and see for yourself the profit you can make. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:54:36
This is really cool!
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:16:44
The way I read the email was they have to be ready just in case it does happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:37:09
I don't know why you are arguing when I can go see the income daily and it clearly tells me how much it is making currently. Maybe over time it will go down or even up if btc becomes worth more. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:15:36
By no means an expert but from gut feeling/reddit im saying its going to reach new highs
