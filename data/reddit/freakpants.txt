Are we really going to correct the guy who said that he is glad that for once people can see past the prejudice, by explaining to him how the prejudice, which he is glad people are seeing past, is wrong?
Don't you think he knows that prejudice is wrong? Don't you think that's what he was referring to? Don't you think we are all smart enough to understand what he's saying?

@_date: 2014-01-01 08:57:48
Because while he is technically correct, it does still increase adoption when there are more places to spend your bitcoin. It won't become practical for most companies to actually hold bitcoin until the value stabilizes. Bitpay is an excellent compromise and increases adoption.
To expect everybody in the world to suddenly accept, use and hold BTC instantly is crazy. Until the adoption is widespread enough and prize stable enough, compromises need to be made.
At some point, companies will start to **want** to hold BTC, at which point Bitpay will slowly fade out of relevance because companies will be looking to eliminate their fees.

I stayed for about a month after the issues began. I didn't take all the frantic warnings serious at first. When I got concerned I tried to withdraw a test amount myself. When this withdrawal didn't go through for 2 weeks I decided it wasn't worth the risk, withdrew to bitcoin and got the hell out of dodge. Lucky for me, since validating my bitstamp account took forever and there was a huge boost at that time (about 100-200 upwards) i actually even gained a lot from that transfer (since I bought the btc on gox before my bitstamp account was validated).

Except the purpose of a Bitcoin ATM isn't the same as a regular ATM.
A regular ATM serves to convert your digital balance into cash. That's a process which isn't needed once you actually have Bitcoin. Once you have your balance, you're in direct control of it.
A Bitcoin ATM is a way to obtain BTC, and you pay a fee because this is an alternative, easier way of obtaining it. BTC ATM's are not the ideal way of obtaining bitcoin, and just like other services, are just a crutch until it is more widespread. Bitcoin doesn't really ***need*** ATM's, it's just easier to get more people into it with methods they are familiar with.

Considering the speed of this current upward trend, there will most likely be another correction soon. Should drop to somewhere between 140-170 easily and then it will start a slower climb again. 
**note**: those numbers are pulled out of my ass. It could easily fall more/less. It's just what the price would normally be at considering the growth of the last 5 months. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:33:19
I do look at them as opportunities, don't get me wrong. It's just that people usually use the argument "it's a bubble" to mean that the current price is too high and cant be sustained. Personally I don't think we will hit 266 again before another plop.

Of course it is. But greed is the reason people stayed in, when they could have cashed out to a profit earlier.

Believers in goxbucks think the mtgox price is irrelevant and should be completely ignored, as there is no way of actually getting that cash out. They coined the term to say that money in Gox is not real money.
As usual, the reality is a bit less extreme.
If you can think a bit less dramatic than that, you could have predicted that stamp would also hit 200 sooner or later.

I'm already cashed out. Last time I bought in was at $124, so I was pretty happy to sell at around $192. If the price crashes right now, I'm still up on my initial investment. And I will continue to hold 16 coins which were pretty much a free side effect of my speculation so far, in case we really are "going to the moon".
For your information, 7 days ago Mtgox was at 150.75 and bitstamp was at 135. So, no people haven't been saying this for a week.
There will be a correction, the only question is how dramatic it will be. There has been a slow, steady growth since the crash in April, and there is no specific reason for the current boost at the current speed. I think what you need to accept is the fact that this isn't a bad thing. As with most bubbles so far, the value after the burst is going to be higher than after it's start.

I'm not saying the theory doesn't make sense. This could be the reason. But anything else could have happened as well.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:16:33
Honestly, I got lucky. I've been doing quite well in general, but this worked out so well because I was planning on migrating to bitstamp anyway, so I had an unrelated reason to go all in. And then I had some issues with getting my account verified, so I got to see the current boost in full effect without being able to sell.
Yes, "when" is also a question, but to me that doesn't matter as much. Considering the speed of the the current rise, it's probably soon. (next 10 days)
"early July" - I actually consider that aftershocks from the main crash. Subjective of course.
"China" - yeah... from what I hear their boom is supposedly based on the baidu news, which in turn isn't actually as big as a deal as they think.
We're going too fast. I guess you think what we're seeing right now is sustainable, healthy growth. I don't ;) It's hyped up, and people will wake up at some point and panic. They always have. Heck, Silkroad crashed the price by $20 even though it was rather obvious that this wouldn't mean the end of bitcoin. For every guy that has experience and patience and won't panic, because they learned, 2 new guys have arrived who have no clue/self esteem and will panic at the slightest sign of trouble :) And that's awesome, because when the dust settles, I will hold even more coins for the future :)

Anarchocapitalism. Ending Democracy. Conspiracy theories. Go read some of the stuff, I dare you.
If calling out crazy for what it is makes me an asshole, then I guess I am. Bitcoin is a very rational and sensible idea. People like that will only hurt it's credibility. I'm sorry if that offends you.
Also, in case you haven't noticed, I started a serious discussion with the guy who I called out for being a nutbag. I even made steps towards his position. I'm still waiting on an explanation how anarchy is a good solution when evil or lazy people exist.
I'm all for critizing the current system, a lot of shit is broken and unfair. But if your plan of action is abolishing government I can't take you serious.

Maybe, just maybe people are optimistic about the future of bitcoin. You can keep attributing every jump upwards as insecurity towards mt gox, but when bitstamp keeps adapting the same jumps each and every time it just becomes more and more obvious that isn't what's happening.
To clarify: Obviously there IS insecurity towards Mt. Gox. I'm just very much in doubt that was the reason for these two huge jumps of 10$ each this week.

I think the current rise is the first time I really saw bitstamp decouple significantly from the mtgox price. But I think most of it can be attributed to the speed of it all. Sometimes mtgox would minispike and then minicrash, whereas bitstamp did not, but ultimately ended up in the same place. Mtgox is still leading the rallies and crashes for the USD. It might not be followed entirely the same way on an hourly basis, but on a day-by-day basis the graph always looks pretty much the same. I'm very interested to see whether or not we will ever see a complete decoupling.

First of all, I'm not even from america, so we are already making bad assumptions. I mentioned elsewhere in this discussion that america has a rather bad 2-party system. Surprisingly it scores rather high in various democracy ratings. There is definitely something going wrong in american politics. I'm not going to dispute that.
What Anenome5 is trying to say though that democracy in itself is bad, because it enforces rules on minorities. His alternative seems to be no rules, which is obviously an even worse solution.

Someone else is downvoting you, sorry for that. In any case, I don't see any (increased) reason for panic. Let's not forget that bitstamp keeps on following all of these upswings reliably.
This either means arbitrage is possible (which would mean that withdrawals DO happen) or that the increased price is more related to growing confidence in bitcoin than to mt. gox panic.

To be fair, there is a difference between just getting your money (which yes, you can do whenever you damn well please) and asking thousands of others to do it at the same time. obviously this is going to cause problems because every bank has a limited amount of cash.
This will lead to people being denied at some point which in turn will cause a snowball effect because people think that the bank is in trouble (when it probably isn't).

Volatility doesn't matter. Bitpay. Done. Just as other systems like Paysafecard offer tools that are easy to integrate, so does Bitpay. Considering Riot likes to offer many different payment options, even for different countries, they seem predestined to also adopt Bitcoin as a payment option.

I'm not blaming anything...
@_date: 2013-05-11 06:05:50
What I'm trying to say is that the market would perhaps react differently to lost coins than to hoarded coins - both are not in circulation but with hoarded coins there is always the implication that they can be used at some point. but since we don't know the difference between hoarded and   lost coins the market can't react to it. Right now the amount of lost coins is irrelevant because there are still new coins being made. But when the point is reached where you can't actually get a new coin easily this changes. At this point estimates of lost/hoarded coins will factor into the speculation about the price point. But at this point these two types of coins become the same, because there is no guaranteed way to know that a coin is actually lost.
Understand where I'm coming from? :)

 I think that's wrong. I currently buy my RP with Paysafecard, because I don't want to own a credit card. Bitcoin could eliminate the step of getting a paysafe card. (I have to leave the house for it) Because I'm holding BTC mostly as an investment, if BTC was available I'd probably use it, because, well, I'm buying RP anyway and ***I would feel obligated to use it to demonstrate it's worth***. I can pay with some of the coins I'm already holding and buy new coins.

Lets ignore fees for this example (they can be calculated in)
Let's say you invest 100$ at 5$. 
The prize raises to 6$. You now have 120$. Cash out 110$ - you made a profit, but you still got 2 bitcoins riding. 
Of course greed will tell you this is not an acceptable scenario, because you made **only** 10$, and if you leave everything in it might raise to 10$. So you leave everything in, it goes down to 4$, and you feel silly. While if you cash out and it raises to 10$, you also feel a bit silly, but you didn't lose anything.

Because they have been around for a very long time now, and if they were actually going to fold, it would have happened already. Or for arbitrage. Pick your poison.
**edit:** you also have to consider that transitioning from gox to another exchange right now also probably means that you will have to take a substantial hit because of the price difference. if you're ok with your money being inflexible and trust gox to come out on the other side of their issues, staying makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:09:03
if you're going to do this again and again, at least mention the fact that they don't have to hold bitcoin, they can have them converted by a service like bitpay. Otherwise the same old argument "it's too volatile" will keep coming back.
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:27:12
well there is an unknown component to it. we don't know how much mtgox is telling us is true, for one. and they're not telling us much to begin with. the difference in price isn't really a good indicator of the actual risk. in reality, it's probably influenced much more by arbitrage which in turn is dependent on withdrawal delays, fees, slippage, etc...
the only thing I am confident enough to say right now is that a dollar in mtgox isn't worthless.
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:13:28
