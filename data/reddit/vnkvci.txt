part that starts with "—–BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK—– and ends with —–END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK—–" save in text file, change extension from .txt to .asc and open it with PGP software to import key

thank you! :) when should I expect btc on bityes account?
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:19:34
Nothing like 10,000btc for pizza, but I purchased xbox 360 and few games for 16+ btc, and over 50btc spent on gambling and virtual miners. I'm not sorry for xbox but I'm sorry for gambling and miners :/ I would spend it wisely nowadays, but guess I learned my lesson.
