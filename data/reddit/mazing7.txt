I made a lot of cash from like a $500 investment. When you make 100x no one talks shit and everyone wants to know how to get in. But when you lose 20% of your earnings everyone thinks you’re an idiot. I don’t tell anyone anything and honestly if anyone is making fun of you for investing in crypto just stop being their friends cause they clearly don’t support you and they’re probably not your real friends. I’d consider leaving your girlfriend too and look into getting a cat. With all the money you’re going to be making in crypto you’ll have enough for all the cocaine hookers and lambos money can buy.

Dude bought 85k of a coin that doesn't exist yet and now will never exist. He bought it thinking it would overtake bitcoin since he paid 1000 per coin that investment could of turned into 700k in a few months . Instead now he has about 10k

The OP is trying to get a payout requesting donations and shit talking projects. It’s going to create discredit crypto even further. Man can we get just one person who doesn’t have secret motives to actually defend blockchain publicly
