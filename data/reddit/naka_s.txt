Gold !!!!

What you are going through is a phenomenon called PANIC SELLING and FOMO.... it is obvious in the current stage ..... HODL !!!

13.2K, it moves like a rocket.... and falls like a stone !!
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:54:17
what is your view ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:57:53
It's a risk we all knew might come in the journey.... Patience is the virtue we need to keep... HODL !!!
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:05:34
you have to do it from your debit card, I guess prepaid cards don't get accepted, especially if you are a new customer with less transactions
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:25:17
I guess if you are a n00b, you should go with coinbase and if you know what you are doing, go with GDAX

Picked up again.... hope it continues now.... It's been very long time since my balls are in my throat :D
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:15:52
I guess it will keep sinking... X-mas is important than HODL for few folks who are cashing. I can understand the sentiments but they would feel like fools after new year !!!

Also take a look on this,it may be what you say

1. BIP38 address : encrypt privkey with a password 
2. multisignature : you can use pubkeys to create a multisignature address  
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:03:13
Send all to a different wallet for which you have the seed and make sure you have saved it. It would incur a transactional cost... but better safe than sorry...

This is a friend's blog... I'll share the feedback...

The way it is doing down, seems like a dead cat bounce... but the shrink is not big.... This means a good potential to be back to 15K range anytime. I think it would regain on 26-29th Dec with a dip on 30th-1Jan..... post which it would blast off to moon....
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:01:07






We are in it together mate, we have survived, and panic sells are common, depends on your risk appetite... so HODL whatever is left and look for dip, if there are significant ones.... I don't forsee a big drop any soon, but I may be wrong !!
