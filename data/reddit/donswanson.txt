Cmon Barra swap. Those japanese sixes are so early 2000s.

Yeah they have for a while. They have their own check out lanes for BTC.

Thanks for using it. Hope you bought back in using the fiat equivalent. Gotta keep the market rolling.

Sorry, didn't see your comment. I've never used them. I don't see a need for a small amount of bitcoin. You can do it yourself with a few addresses. They seem professional, but how much can you really trust a stranger with money you don't want to lose.

I had not. Looks interesting. Thanks!

They have not heard of bitcoin fog?

Visiting Japan atm. There is BTC billboards and magazines and atms all over the place. Can also buy using BTC at one of their biggest department stores BIC camera.

You fucked up, and bittrex fucked up. Hope they can recognize that and make compensations.

Loved them vettes when I was a kid. Good thing you bought it yesterday.....

I'm from Australia. What are those ones after adsl?

Bic camera takes BTC as well! It's a department store with heaps of large stores. Crypto is very healthy in Japan.

I've heard a bit about Bakkt. Never really  researched into it much. It's a payment processor by the looks of it. How would a Joe Blow invest in it?

And my axe!

Promise I'm not an anti-shill 
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:47:24
Damn. I'm in Melbourne. I'm more inclined to drop a LTC sign though. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 04:20:36
Thanks for the info. 
Another good reason for privately controlled wallets

Why don't we all use litecoin then? Sick of spending $2.5 to move btc
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:04:25
In truth I do use it. It's way better for moving around and I pay with it whenever possible. I don't get why people ignore it so much. It's boring and dependable. Exactly what is needed as a currency.
@_date: 2016-05-10 03:58:08
Well I haven't heard anything bad about coinjar. Should I have? 
I use them for all my exchanges and have had no problems. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:19:30
I keep buying when I think we are low enough. It keeps dropping. I'm sorry.
I'll stop soon I promise.
