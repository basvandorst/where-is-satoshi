As a (post-Dell merge) alienware owner, you should not buy alienware.

I *DON'T* know what I'm talking about, but when I was mining, I don't remember that taking up massive space.

I can dig that. 
Let me make a quick guess.  You finally heard about or finally decided to dive into the BTC game within the past, say, 48 hours.  Great!  Glad to have you.  And China.  And your neighbors.  And a major investors.  And some US companies.  All buying in.  All at once.
All at once.
Once things calm down (I'd give it a few weeks) it'll get better.

I remember when I was in middle-school.

Yeah, but we took down so much contact information back them.  Many places still don't do credit card because of the hassle.
This is why I've invested in LTC as well.  That faster block time makes it more desirable to brick-and-mortars, if it catches on.

Sorry, I assumed when you said, and this is a quote, "If you are "pro-Bitcoin"... and you aren't using Gyft, you're just a detriment to the community at this point," that you meant "If you are "pro-Bitcoin"... and you aren't using Gyft, you're just a detriment to the community at this point."

So what you're saying is basically. . . 
Even if you support the BTC network, run a full blockchain node, promote BTC awareness, accept BTC at your place of work, and lobby for acceptance of BTC, but don't use GYFT, you're a detriment to the community.
What a douche.

Thought about it, but for the sake of coherence, I decided to keep the word 'slightly' in the clarification.  Saying "infinitesimally slightly" wouldn't make any sense.

This is pretty much why my businesses will (probably) never accept BTC.  I'm not going to assume that the customer paid, I want proof.
It just doesn't fit with certain business types.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:23:20
just keep trying.  Took me, like, 10-15 attempts.

Thanks to you, my coins are worth slightly (near-infinitely slightly) more than they'd otherwise be.  Cheers.

As a successful businessperson, I've always followed the principle of "get more money, not less".

Nothing except money from people who wouldn't otherwise buy a Tesla.
Now admittedly, a for-profit company should be completely uninterested in bringing in money.  It's not even on the priority list for them.
I can see why you wouldn't list that as one of the possible gains.
