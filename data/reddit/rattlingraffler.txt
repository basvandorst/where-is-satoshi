You couldn't just read one of the 100s of threads that have been made about this over the past 6 months? Or are you being disingenuous and are just here to FUD?

$2-$10 in fees to do what? Move thousands? What are you buying with bitcoin at this moment in time? Why WOULD you buy anything right now when the price can shoot up tomorrow? We won't need scaling on chain unless we had mass adoption, and price stabilization, something like Amazon taking bitcoin. We have plenty of time to wait for LN. This fee argument makes no sense when you start to peel it apart.

Thank you.

You do realize investors don't get to dictate and control everything that happens with their money, right? Otherwise it would be called buying, not investing? And that they are one of many investors? Do YOU think for yourself? Or do you just read some bullshit on and take is as gospel? You are a moron.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:31:43
Why? Why right now? This is a bullshit argument with 0 substance. Nothing is needed RIGHT NOW.

Bingo. Bcash pumpers fail to acknowledge this central point.

Dude are you serious with this Bilderberg shit? You think they are controlling blockstream? Yeah, thats a conspiracy.

BItcoin went up over 800% this year, why bother with trading if you are just in it for the long term? I don't have time to actively trade. Its just a long term investment for me.

We didn’t have net neutrality until the end of the Obama administratiom and the Internet thrived just fine. Sick of you statist net neutrality FUDders.

No, it uses a bloom filter to prevent revealing your addresses.

You can’t donate to save money. Donating is just a deduction, so at best you get back 39% of your donation, but you still spent 61% more than if you had just paid those taxes.

Thats how the quote ends actually “even if it’s your own”

We just had great support for crypto from the US gov. South Korea was FUD and is not banning. India FUD was false. Japan treating it as a currency. Governments seem to be if not increasingly embracing, at the very least accepting the inevitability of crypto’s rise.

You could have just added some line breaks instead of deleting it! Now I feel bad lol

Only while BTC is not a dominant or near dominant currency. As soon as you can spend your BTC everywhere, you don't have to peg salaries to fiat anymore.

Electrum isn’t a hardware wallet, its software. Hardware wallets are physical devices like the Trezor or Ledger Nano.

Please read A Random Walk Down Wall Street. Elliot Wave is the equivalent of a witch doctor. Do not rely on anything he or other technical analysts say. If they end up being right, its by accident. Beware.
