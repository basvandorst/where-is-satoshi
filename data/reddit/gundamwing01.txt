+1 bro. i hate getting raped. especially up the butt and out my mouth. worst feeling ever...
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:27:34
BUT.. the real question is, will it run Minecraft?
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:03:14
thank you. great input.
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:05:24
thank you for the suggestion. i thought there would be more "pro" level people in general in the BTC forum so i posted here.
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:17:24
All good points from both sides, but my input (or question rather) would be "how does this stack up against other vendors with 'insurance'"? Is Coinbase industry standard or no? Because if insurance companies wont insure all that offline storage then isnt it true for most other wallet vendors too? Maybe Xapo is "real" insurance?
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:02:51
great link! this is what "school" should be all about!!
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:06:41


thank you for the reply. i see that you are absolutely correct. I have to learn how to "learn BTC" and obtain knowledge from various sources. Cant be a Doctor just by reading one comprehensive book.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:36:47
Off topic, but is the Bitcoin Financial Association still active?
I know its all volunteers, but I haven't really seen any updates. Just wondering!
BTC Fo Lyfe!
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:27:57
Nice! Hope the acquisition was paid for via BTC. Also, Vitalik Buterin is DA MAN!
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:45:41
yes. for now, just wait it out and just keep reading. the ledger was split and now there are two copies. meaning ur shit isnt going anywhere. its not lost unless u lose the keys. so dont worry about it for now. just keep reading and getting more comfortable with the wallets you want to use and be careful of how you import ur address and matching keys. u will have 2 wallets with 2 currencies. thats why pple are saying "free money" cuz ur money just got split.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:43:20
haha. but BTC is made by strangers for strangers...
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:58:54
o i c. haha. now its kinda funny.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:54:50
so if we have a BTC fork, then maybe a BTC spoon will come next?
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:52:02
no dude. ur not getting what im saying. thats fine. no reason to argue on the internet really. whats the point?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:40:11
except to dream about oceans of cake...
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:48:09
pWned! haha..
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:41:04
damn! lucky! so ur at George Washington? Michigan? Dubai?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:49:18
technically, all subs could be considered for beginners, but when you look at the threads, its clear that some subs are better for beginners than others. this sub is very very "all general". its not the best place, but its not wrong. check out the beginner BTC sub. its a good place.  
  
but my comment was more about you doing shit that may cause u to lose money faster than a mofo stealing that shit. just keep reading and be careful out there man.
check this out too:

and there is also an eerie thick mist limiting your vision. you can barely see a foot in front of you and hear a faint female scream off in the distance. and here you thought this was Silent Hill...
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:17:03
dude. i will be straight up with you since youre lucky that so many people here are so nice to u and willing to help out.  
  
what you just posted is exactly whats wrong with the current crypto hype. not sure how much u have invested, but this is real money.  
  
so basically, you have no idea what youre doing, but you posted a solo thread crying for help since u decided to YOLO due to FOMO and engaged in probably one of the most complex financial instruments during a civil war era. seriously? SMH.  
  
anyway, this is only the beginning. meaning, shits gonna get real all the way to da moon and u better study until your eyes fall out. no joke. but looks like some are already answering ur questions. nice.  
  
also FYI. many questions can be asked: r/BitcoinBeginners
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:45:55
wat does your response have anything to do with what i said? im talking about people just joining crypto because they think its a get rich quick scheme and asking crazy questions when their own financial health is at stake.  
  
when you see noobs ask "just bought tons of BTC, so now what? where do I put it?". that to me is a huge issue.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:05:46
haha exactly...
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:14:46
always fukn knew they were untrustworthy mofos... wish I could claim OP of this post from 3 damn years ago, but this guy fucks...
[Reminder: BTC-E is shady as fuck](
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:59:51
doesnt matter. the ledger was split as of today at a certain time. whatever u had before is copied to both. that stays. ur keys will unlock the snapshot of whatever it was before the split. so now after the split, whatever you do to one will NOT be copied to the other. u mix on one chain, but thats no different than what u did before. just dont think of BTC vs BCC, make up ur own name so ur not confused because thats how different it is. u can call it CCC or AAA or whatever, maybe even BROAIDS.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:40:55
what? u know its aug 1st right? past the UTC time when the fork was scheduled? right now you dont do shit. you HODL. all the BTC moving to private wallets should have been long awhile back before today. not sure where ur funds are now, but they should be fine where they are. i assume its in a wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:13:48
because this is what happens when plebs just want to join the bandwagon frenzy based on social media when they have no business talking about any crypto. haters back in the day now ask how to get in. fukem.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:31:16
ok. so youre saying you thot BCC was going downhill and didnt invest correctly? i dont get it man. theres no way anyone can understand your thoughts from just a screenshot...
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:46:40
god dammit youre so right.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:33:35
what do you mean? how are you trying to buy it?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:50:49

@_date: 2017-08-29 07:49:43
yea but you could at least buy Heranus. just saying...
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:40:47
well, lets just see what happens when Google/FB/AMZN/IBM data centers decide to get involved and even upgrade to quantum computing then shits gonna get REALz...  
  
but they probably have no interest. given the cost and the size of the network, they wouldnt be able to overtake it, but would be very interesting to see them get involved.
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:50:04
thats the idea, but honestly, just keep it in ur wallet until the storm is over. u still own China BTC when u control the keys, and if China comes out ahead u can bring back to kraken. otherwise, your shit is stuck at kraken offchain. u dont control jack.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:06:08
no wonder. i was like where you at bro. in da moon obviously...
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:31:58
basically its the 1st min of the 1st quarter. doesnt mean shit yet and theres always too much talk and speculation to fill the airtime early on. we just gotta wait for the naked halftime show and then the last quarter, all in, no backing out...

haha. glad i am not the only one seeing the stupidity around here.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:35:11
this is exactly the kind of shit where people jump on the bandwagon and creates the current zombie fever level for crypto without knowing jack shit. coinbase loving it like mcDs right now. more n00bs the better.  
  
yea, your username checks out. i would educate their asses because this happens for everything like the lottery as well. Powerball now at $700MM? damn, better buy a ticket! give no fucks about the odds.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:57:23
cant imagine whats being sold at 2300 and where...
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:48:18
bro. sorry about ur situation but u cant compare coinbase to an overseas scam company. its the not the same. ur advice is fine in general but it just depends.
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:53:48
how do u have access to a bloom terminal? thats what i wanna know. if ur at an investment bank, give us the deets on the water cooler talk bro!

@_date: 2017-08-23 04:36:19
aw. did you just buy BTC too because the internet told you to? if you cant handle real talk then BTC is not for you. BTC is still the wild wild west and crypto is fukn hard to understand. you dont just come on this forum "asking for help" when the wiki and the internet is already exploding with info. now there is a gold rush. everyone and their dogs want in. meaning plenty of people jump in without knowing WTF they are doing. when you get burned, dont cry about it. you see the Polo exchange forums? or how about people who got raped by BTCe. give me a break. do your research.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:11:03
well, its recovery from hitting ridic levels at $3k, but its not recovery back to our all time highs. so yea, I would love to see $5k too, but the FUD Force is out. believers are getting a beat down. we may stay at this level for awhile.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:57:33
yep. pretty much.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:56:37
nice. u get the bottles and ill get the models. everyone's invited...
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:32:55
gawd. finally. someone busting out r/wallstreetbets. altho i would say u were still pretty kind in your delivery.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:51:21
ur joking right? use a damn reputable escrow service dude.
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:19:59
u broke the chain brah! now u have to give us 100 oranges!
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:11:29

why u trying to be Sad Panda?
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:00:06
where can i find the video of the inside like MTV Cribs? cant believe you built that for your dog. fukn nice man.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:35:36
this is why we fucking need a private BTC lounge just like reddit gold. having multiple tiers would help filter out stupid HODL shitposts.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:02:51
yes. exactly like those. amazon has a great selection and I buy a lot from amazon. [recently bought this one.](  
  
you dont need to look too far to see how crazy the BTC shirt game is. tons of vendors out there now. just copy it or do better. or even be the damn walmart/costco of everything. meaning something for everyone. the lovers and the haters. the subtle and super pimp daddy arrogant. even have something for the shit talkers who wanna clown on tapout shirts.  
  
i know u have ur own vision and have a certain style, but the question depends on how large the market share is and size of the target demographic. are there enough who like ur certain style to massively grow ur business? not sure. just do many many trial runs. 10-20 shirts each and see. keep it LIMITED EDITION. who says u only need 5 designs and go ALL IN. no man. just keep testing and see what pple like. build scarcity.  
  
just be careful not to listen to shit talkers who would never buy a damn shirt anyway. pet peeve of mine is someone who loves talking shit, but would never buy even when its perfect.  
  
primarily, i have bought from:  
1) Amazon  
2) bitgear.co  
3) bitcointshirtstore.com  
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:13:23
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:17:42
yea, thats because BTC is still the Wild Wild West man. I mean what did you expect? i hope ur not naive to think the USA has the infrastructure to support everything related to BTC. not just talking about attorneys, but its the same with CPAs, the facking IRS, etc etc.  
  
what exactly is your situation? whats the problem?  
  
also, if you really want good BTC attorneys then you need to go research ALL the BTC related lawsuits and those who went to prison for BTC scams. All those lawyers know some shit about BTC. hire the same attorneys. Im talking about Silk Road and the Shremlin and etc. There are many of them. Go find it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:54:26
and not just the tip...
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:10:42
yes. hence the panic selling. big daddy china volume is still huge and people still peg it at 95%+ of the global BTC trade volume. even still, China govt doesnt own the blockchain. if it did, BTC wouldve died long ago.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:12:50
yes. LBC has escrow services, but many dont trust it because of all the scams thats possible. go look it up. hence just find and use a better one online. you want USA prices right? and dont use paypal. u will get banned.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:25:07
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:42:26
good. here is the straight talk.  
  
1) personally, your shit sucks. (for now)  
  
2) im not gonna wear orange cartoons on my shirt basically confirming to everyone that i dont get any pussy  
  
3) dont fall for the trap of loving your own work. YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN CUSTOMER. meaning, for something so damn subjective as clothing, u need to have something for everyone whos not into orange cartoons on their shirt.  
  
4) you need to have another section for BEAST MODE (aka I fukn bought BTC and now i have a yacht with bottles and models, so go fuck yourself)  
  
5) you need more shit that is just CLEAN and straight up like your hat and beanie. i like those. i can wear that with fukn pride and open conversations. not a damn pizza.  
  
6) look at skater shirts. thats the kinda concepts you should also have. nice and clean. not fukn BS sponge bob square pants on my damn shirt. i dont want bitches seeing that shit making me look like a Big Beta Cunt. i mean hotties may want these shirts too, so give them some cartoons, but not us dudes.  
  
7) where are FOMO and YOLO BTC shirts? you need more variety. some want to stay subtle and some want to say "fuck you haters". so having both will be good.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:02:33
dude. we need to move the massive traffic to r/BitcoinBeginners...
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:58:54
if it doesnt, you will thank urself when it goes back to 5k.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:04:02
well u didnt sound mean and u dont need to apologize. its called competition. u have ur own vision. so just make shit better. thats it.

@_date: 2017-09-16 08:49:57
well thats pretty much 99% of this sub so...
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:17:21
if the right people read your post and want to bother giving advice then maybe. but experienced investors are tired with this sub. its just trash.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:25:07
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:59:26
well then just hold on tight.  
  
u will become powered up panda real quick in a few months if the current $1k recovery is any indication.  
  
RIP those losers who sold at $3k screaming BTC was a scam...
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:19:56
then thats the key problem. youre working with scum. how can they say ur money is not worth their time? wtf is that about? I want an actual bank to say that which will be met with a lawsuit. unfortunately, this is the Wild Wild West aka WWW internet. meaning these exchanges can do whatever they fuck want because they are not banks.  
  
go negotiate with them. ask them to speak to a manager and escalate and demand retrieval. however, offer to pay a fee. paying a fee for retrieval is legit since it was ur fault.
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:13:12
dude. you did it wrong. just bust out the "O" after my "L"...
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:07:00
good article.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:31:15
this guy uses Alipay. think about that. Coinbase and verification is out of the question for this weak hands n00b who is "$500 poorer"...
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:05:55
go to r/BitcoinBeginners
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:59:56
haha. thats probably it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:46:45
fuck. finally someone smart here. thot it was just me...
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:15:17
everyone on this sub should have watched this many times over but n00bs will always stay n00bs. its a rule.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:32:22
would be nice if you provided more detail. i mean you just sound like someone in panic mode...
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:45:08
yes. very true. we will see dude, but if it goes to $2k, im selling everything i own and going homeless to buy more...
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:22:41
well u can do the analysis urself. so say China bans all BTC. and BTC crashes and now its worth $1. so what then? u just give up? miners all give up? coinbase and kraken just closes up and says "welp. we tried..." and all the haters just come out from the forest and say "i told you so!" and then what? blockchain just gets deleted? and Jamie Dimon says "Ha! You bitches!" just run the scenario in your head dude. cmon. people are in panic mode. if BTC went to $1 I would sell everything i fucking owned and invest in BTC and live fukn homeless for years until BTC skyrockets again cuz i know it will.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:32:13
you didnt lose shit if you dont realize the loss...
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:28:51
ok ok. lets redo this. the blockchain was broken.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:14:07
yea. everyone should know this. people must understand that CHINA does NOT equal BTC. meaning, the whole fukn point of BTC is so that governments like China cant do exactly what they are trying to do right now. people who understand BTC is not caring about wtf is going on except seeing Walmart discount Black Friday sale prices. if that money cant stay in China, guess where its gonna go? just disappear? youre kidding urself...
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:38:33
ur overreacting brah. there is nothing wrong with BTC. this is just a dumb dump. buy more on the dip.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:17:42
yea, thats because BTC is still the Wild Wild West man. I mean what did you expect? i hope ur not naive to think the USA has the infrastructure to support everything related to BTC. not just talking about attorneys, but its the same with CPAs, the facking IRS, etc etc.  
  
what exactly is your situation? whats the problem?  
  
also, if you really want good BTC attorneys then you need to go research ALL the BTC related lawsuits and those who went to prison for BTC scams. All those lawyers know some shit about BTC. hire the same attorneys. Im talking about Silk Road and the Shremlin and etc. There are many of them. Go find it.
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:59:45
haha. exactly.  
  
OP, you need to give us more detail about the exchanges and the banks you are using or maybe using. you can get into deep shit because BTC is being tracked heavily in the US and it not anonymous. arbitrage is fine, but if it looks like money laundering, then your accounts may get shut down. so let us know what youre working with.  
  
US BSA and AML/KYC laws are very strict. im pretty sure in Brazil you can go YOLO and not give a fuck, but i am talking about about your family. i assume they will use Coinbase.  
  
also, just letting you know, this thought process is constantly used with people have who multiple accounts at multiple exchanges. there are crazy ass spreads between the same exact currency. not even talking about arbitrage exchange rates. meaning straight BTC costs $4k at one place and $4.1k somewhere else for example. so its def possible.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:33:43
can confirm. i also just spoke to the Chinese government about these rumors. but they put me on hold and I had to dial 0 for the operator and I finally got through after about 15 min. then they started talking shit about BTC and said BCH has a bigger horse deek, so I three-wayed conference called Big D Trump because I believe this to be a presidential matter, but Trump said he was busy with Pudding Putin. So I actually had no choice but to send an E-Mail to Kim Jong cuz i dont have his number. He hasnt responded yet cuz hes at a missile test launch site all day. So I had to end the call with China prematurely. Will report back when I get updates.
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:29:01
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:48:47
nice nice nice...
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:29:12
well if you KNOW BTC is going to skyrocket in the future then any lower price is a good time to buy. yes. you cant always implement the same strategy for other financial instruments like equities because that stock may never go back up.  
  
But are you saying BTC will always be lower and will never reach 5k? dont scare urself dude. if you want to have such limiting beliefs then yea, dont buy shit right now and just sit there watching BTC go down even more and always be wondering if it will keep going down. But what if skyrockets from here and when it becomes 4500 in just 1HR then you can go read my comment again cuz its the same answer to ur question.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:53:24
no problem brah...
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:06:42
keep averaging down dude. BTC 5k cmon!
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:29:15
u dont. but n00bs care. u saw the post by the dad who invested with his daughters college fund without telling his wife and shitted all over himself and sold it when btc crashed to $3k saying bitcoin is a scam? he said the news sources convinced him btc will be 10k next month and thot was a sure bet.  
  
what a fucking idiot clown. thats the kind of shit im talking about. nobody listens to anyone here except YouTube. apparently its the only credible news source for millennials.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:10:23
whenever i go to the bunny ranch, they also ask me about my hard wallets and soft wallets too. but i always tell them its temporary and I just need a break...
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:05:04
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:02:07
well thats the problem with the 99% of n00bs on this sub. BTC is a investment vehicle with a purpose. meaning, you dont fucking just come here, pay money for BTC like youre buying fucking underwear and get to keep it without shit happening. same for buying a car or groceries. n00bs are used to buying something and just expect it to be there afterwards.  
  
no. THIS IS A FUCKING VOLATILE ERUPTION STOCK. Dont come here with weak hands and weak minds thinking you will get rick quick because of all the lambos you see on YouTube. Those fucking cunts. They are seriously creating the frenzy and making people lose money...
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:48:01
yea. nothing to fear here. price will recover.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:53:27
i love it when they edge it. omgaw...
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:43:44
omg. never ending stream of n00bs... so you invested your kids college fund into BTC without knowing jack shit? well lucky for you, you didnt make a mistake. so go have a drink.  
  
you said ur kid goes to college next year? then you have plenty of time for BTC to skyrocket back. stop being a little bitch. you think this is end game for crypto? dont be retarded. either learn more or get ur money out when BTC goes back up. ur not ready for this shit.  
  
EDIT: HOLY SHIT. YOU SOLD IT CUZ YOU DIDNT WANT TO LOSE MORE MONEY? wow. good luck to you...  
  
EDIT 2: HOLY SHIT. $1k BTC Recovery in 24HRS. This is why you HODL. Damn you for selling your kids college fund so early. Next time, dont be such an idiot. Oh wait. There is no next time. You now think BTC is a scam based on your comments. Hope you read this shit with your other primary Reddit accounts cuz you need to create a post TIFU...
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:45:34
thats why u have to use escrow services. no 1:1 exchanges. too risky.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:14:07
yea. everyone should know this. people must understand that CHINA does NOT equal BTC. meaning, the whole fukn point of BTC is so that governments like China cant do exactly what they are trying to do right now. people who understand BTC is not caring about wtf is going on except seeing Walmart discount Black Friday sale prices. if that money cant stay in China, guess where its gonna go? just disappear? youre kidding urself...
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:19:23
but will it explode?
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:13:12
dude. you did it wrong. just bust out the "O" after my "L"...
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:34:03
u should know by now this sub is just 99% n00bs who bought BTC last week yelling HODL when they sold everything at $3k last month screaming BTC is wack...
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:31:15
this guy uses Alipay. think about that. Coinbase and verification is out of the question for this weak hands n00b who is "$500 poorer"...
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:27:51
haha. no brah... we were students. not n00bs. key difference. we actually learn and modify our behavior accordingly. hence ur right about the total n00b fever frenzy going on now and getting fucked in the process.  
  
always love the posts "just bought BTC, but now what?! what do I do with it?!" or "about to buy BTC but where do I also access my BCH?"  
  
like, are you fuking joking dude? gtfo of here...
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:40:27
well i would never consider spraying temp particle wood covering windows as vandalism. that shits gonna get removed and dumped anyway. BUT, the C4 putty all around the door may be vandalism...
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:15:17
everyone on this sub should have watched this many times over but n00bs will always stay n00bs. its a rule.

sorry. wont take anything seriously from a nasty Smegma Cracker...
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:42:26
good. here is the straight talk.  
  
1) personally, your shit sucks. (for now)  
  
2) im not gonna wear orange cartoons on my shirt basically confirming to everyone that i dont get any pussy  
  
3) dont fall for the trap of loving your own work. YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN CUSTOMER. meaning, for something so damn subjective as clothing, u need to have something for everyone whos not into orange cartoons on their shirt.  
  
4) you need to have another section for BEAST MODE (aka I fukn bought BTC and now i have a yacht with bottles and models, so go fuck yourself)  
  
5) you need more shit that is just CLEAN and straight up like your hat and beanie. i like those. i can wear that with fukn pride and open conversations. not a damn pizza.  
  
6) look at skater shirts. thats the kinda concepts you should also have. nice and clean. not fukn BS sponge bob square pants on my damn shirt. i dont want bitches seeing that shit making me look like a Big Beta cunt. i mean hotties may want these shirts too, so give them some cartoons, but not us dudes.  
  
7) where are FOMO and YOLO BTC shirts? you need more variety. some want to stay subtle and some want to say "fuck you haters". so having both will be good.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:40:09
based on my calculations, i also see a Boner In Wet Vag pattern. i recommend hold the thighs tight and go YOLO.
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:19:31
haha. stay sharp man and make those gainz.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:02:43
wow. there goes another one...

why are we still discussing what that dickless fucktard says? this forum shouldnt care anymore.  
  
but i just want to hit up his daughter Laura Dimon. fucking hottie skank. yuummzzz dude...
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:09:41
cmon dude. anytime is a buy time. if you dont get that yet, then GLTA. this price is a steal. if it goes lower, then buy more. goes even lower? BUY EVEN MORE.  
  
the answer is the same for investors and day traders. you buy the dip if you believe BTC is valuable. u continue to keep averaging down because BTC will go straight to the moon. when? who the fuck knows. who cares unless you need the money short term. if you need the money short term, you should not be in the game cuz BTC maybe $1 by the time u need it and you sell too early.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:45:58
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:51:44
oh. i see it now. stupid joke. we dont need anymore shitposts. too many already after BTC crossed $2k. funny to see haters now coming out of the forest who want in.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:12:50
yes. LBC has escrow services, but many dont trust it because of all the scams thats possible. go look it up. hence just find and use a better one online. you want USA prices right? and dont use paypal. u will get banned.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:02:33

@_date: 2017-09-14 21:00:14
so i guess im the only one not assuming what exactly you did. you didnt explain what you did man. give more details dude. i can understand the frustration fury, but explain ur shit brah.  
  
based on the comments, everyone thinks you transferred online vendor controlled BTC to an online BCC address? and you dont have the private keys for any of them? is that what you did?  
  
if so, its up to the vendors to help you. can they? they can absolutely help. why? because they control the private keys. they have your money and they control the money. BTC and BCC addresses are the same fukn thing. you can have BOTH BTC and BCC sit in the same damn address, but if you dont control the keys then its useless.  
  
so its company policy to not help you? thats your problem. youre working with bullshit fuckers who dont wanna give your money back even tho they technically could.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:00:06
where can i find the video of the inside like MTV Cribs? cant believe you built that for your dog. fukn nice man.

if ur really not a scammer and ur legit but just hate how ur commy government is abusing its citizens and shit then use a BTC escrow service to prove ur legit. anyone would buy from u ASAP.

@_date: 2017-09-15 05:47:40
dude. let me just be frank with you cuz i think you need the straight talk. after reading all your updates which shouldve been in the OP to begin with, you sound like a total n00b in life.  
  
when I originally read your OP, i was actually concerned for you. as if someone stole your BTC or you got jacked somehow and fucked up your life. hence the tone of urgency in ur OP. i was interested to help, but actually you just want to create a fukn online BTC gambling casino. give me a fukn break dude. youre not the first. why did you make ur OP sound like ur in trouble? this is also a repost. you had already asked this many times before and nobody gave a damn fuck for good reason.  
  
also your comment of "who knows if someone actually finds me the perfect lawyer for this..." and "if it proves to solve my problem then you will be rewarded well..." just makes you sound like an idiot who cant do research himself.

@_date: 2017-10-10 01:42:19
actually, most sluts should support S2X. just saying...
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:22:41
well u can do the analysis urself. so say China bans all BTC. and BTC crashes and now its worth $1. so what then? u just give up? miners all give up? coinbase and kraken just closes up and says "welp. we tried..." and all the haters just come out from the forest and say "i told you so!" and then what? blockchain just gets deleted? and Jamie Dimon says "Ha! You bitches!" just run the scenario in your head dude. cmon. people are in panic mode. if BTC went to $1 I would sell everything i fucking owned and invest in BTC and live fukn homeless for years until BTC skyrockets again cuz i know it will.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:21:40
I hate using them. I get dick rash.

@_date: 2017-09-15 08:48:25
wow. ur retarded...
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:35:45
just like the Master said, youre question just proved ur point. youre not even close to ready. when you want to make lightening trades on the dip or sell on the spikes and etc, you MUST HAVE MONEY/ASSETS ON DECK ready to be deployed. same day ACH or wire? no way brah. give me a break. that shit should already be sitting in your account. cant afford it? thats ok. then dont trade. simple as that.  
  
one off topic example are those rich fuckers who had money on deck during USA 2009-10. wow. fukn Walmart prices on homes. wish i was ready then. will not make that same mistake on the next one.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:36:15

@_date: 2017-10-09 19:24:08
4) not eating popcorn. too damn busy typing and telling stupid idiots stop selling when BTC hits $3k and calling BTC a scam like the JPM cunt and press the damn buy button. sell ur house. ur wives. ur cars. sell everything. and buy the FUTURE.  
  
Also, how many damn times do I have to tell people [BITCOIN HAS HAPPENED BEFORE...](
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:56:54
okay. but how is the spoon and the spork related? i dont get that part. do you think a knife would ever be introduced? i would expect to see all the key utensils a critical part of the crypto family. just wondering.
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:41:07
its good you mention this cuz its no joke. its real. people need to use credit unions ONLY. and for those who use JPM Chase, youre fukn outta ur mind...
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:36:47
its means your girlfriend had a nice orgasm...
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:18:29
haha. there are too many of them after bitcoin past $2k...
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:19:18
then its clear u just started like 99% of this sub or u dont trade and just HODL blindly.  
  
1) CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index provides the bitcoin price using an average from various exchanges. what does that mean? it means its price is shit.  
  
2) i have more real time alerts directly tracking all major alts and exchanges than a nuclear missile command center. i never look at the CoinDesk price tracker. if polo or GDAX or bitstamp shows 4200 then im gonna shit my pants.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:14:59

@_date: 2017-09-15 00:29:12
well if you KNOW BTC is going to skyrocket in the future then any lower price is a good time to buy. yes. you cant always implement the same strategy for other financial instruments like equities because that stock may never go back up.  
  
But are you saying BTC will always be lower and will never reach 5k? dont scare urself dude. if you want to have such limiting beliefs then yea, dont buy shit right now and just sit there watching BTC go down even more and always be wondering if it will keep going down. But what if skyrockets from here and when it becomes 4500 in just 1HR then you can go read my comment again cuz its the same answer to ur question.
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:33:23
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:27:51
haha. no brah... we were students. not n00bs. key difference. we actually learn and modify our behavior accordingly. hence ur right about the total n00b fever frenzy going on now and getting fucked in the process.  
  
always love the posts "just bought BTC, but now what?! what do I do with it?!" or "about to buy BTC but where do I also access my BCH?"

omg. never ending stream of n00bs... so you invested your kids college fund into BTC without knowing jack shit? well lucky for you, you didnt make a mistake. so go have a drink.  
  
you said ur kid goes to college next year? then you have plenty of time for BTC to skyrocket back. stop being a little bitch. you think this is end game for crypto? dont be retarded. either learn more or get ur money out when BTC goes back up. ur not ready for this shit.  
  
EDIT: HOLY SHIT. YOU SOLD IT CUZ YOU DIDNT WANT TO LOSE MORE MONEY? wow. good luck to you...

@_date: 2017-09-08 23:26:00
ok n00b children. here is the straight talk.  
  
STOP connecting your damn debit cards to coinbase. initiate an ACH PULL FROM Coinbase to your bank using a bank account and routing number. You can also choose wire, but I ALWAYS recommend ACH PULL first to build trust history then wire if really needed or your accounts will get shut down for fraud shit. debit cards has too many limitations and banks dont like seeing like crypto activity.  
  
this BTC goldrush has created full retard mode behaviors as if everything should work smoothly the first time for a technology crippled with Silk Road and Magic The Gathering. now the SEC and IRS are all over this shit like hard penis in wet vagina. if u dont even know wtf I am talking about then its cuz your first phone you ever had was the iPhone 11.  
  
just be careful out there man. do more research.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:03:29

@_date: 2017-09-15 03:10:42
yes. hence the panic selling. big daddy china volume is still huge and people still peg it at 95%+ of the global BTC trade volume. even still, China govt doesnt own the blockchain. if it did, BTC wouldve died long ago.

cmon dude. anytime is a buy time. if you dont get that yet, then GLTA. this price is a steal. if it goes lower, then buy more. goes even lower? BUY EVEN MORE.  
  
the answer is the same for investors and day traders. you buy the dip if you believe BTC is valuable. u continue to keep averaging down because BTC will go straight to the moon. when? who the fuck knows. who cares unless you need the money short term. if you need the money short term, you should not be in the game cuz BTC maybe $1 by the time u need it and you sell too early.

I want an actual bank to say that which will be met with a lawsuit. unfortunately, this is the Wild Wild West aka WWW internet. meaning these exchanges can do whatever they fuck want because they are not banks.  
  
go negotiate with them. ask them to speak to a manager and escalate and demand retrieval. however, offer to pay a fee. paying a fee for retrieval is legit since it was ur fault.

the good shit is called self study and go to crypto conferences where people like Andreas Antonopoulos go to speak. you will get nothing here. go look at this sub. its trash. shitposts 24/7. u know what looks like this sub? facebook newsfeed from all your random 5k max "friends".  
  
i monitor this sub for some random links that i have not read before. ie crowdsourcing news. thats it.  
  
just keep on buying the dips but u should sell all your possessions right now. its worth it.
