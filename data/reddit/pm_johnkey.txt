Which country are you referring too? 
most OECD nations have experienced close to a decade relatively low inflation.

There is allot of info to go through, but if the fed could "print-free-money" as this implies, we would have sky-rocket inflation. 
Yes the Fed prints money, but to say the Fed "prints-free-money" is incorrect, unless you want to find yourself in a situation like Zimbabwe not long ago (and many others).

That’s not how economics work
Edit: Since allot of people have shown interest in my comment let me be clear with what I meant. Yes I agree that the Fed can print money at virtually no cost as the cost of ink, machinery and man-power to physically print the cash is insignificant relative to how much money is created. 
Though, the notion that the Fed "prints-free-money" implies the Fed can willy nilly decide to print money without consequences, Which is false. 
To sum, yes the Fed can create money at no cost, but the consequences could be more costly than the amount printed.

Interesting I never knew there was a bureau for the actual process of printing the money. Where I am from our Centralbank is also responsible for the creation itself.
I don't know why you are getting down-voted.

Hey I am a little confused and interested in your view of how the 2008 GFC could have been avoided. Can you elaborate on that please? Thanks
@_date: 2018-07-22 22:41:27
I 100% agree with you dude.

Dude I'm two months away from graduating with a major in Economics and Finance.
I'm not uneducated in Economics man.

As parasitic the system is (which I do agree with), would you not say Bitcoins has its own major shortfalls which render it incapable to be a stable national currency? 
I do not mean to come across condescending, I am an economics students with a keen interest in the rise of crypto-currency and trying to learn as much as I can.

Yea it does.
Your second paragraph was very thought provoking. A majority of  Bitcoin supporters (whom I've encountered) tend to believe Bitcoins should be the primary and only currency in a nation, which I think is a recipe for disaster. Though the role you explained it can play actually makes sense and is quite thought provoking.
Thanks Stranger

Yes I agree with you. When it will end is another question.

You talking about the CPI? Yea items get moved into and out of the basket of goods all the time to reflect societies purchasing habits. Some items simply aren’t important anymore and skew the results.
I would argue that this doesn’t mean that the inflation’s rate are so inaccurate that they would reflect healthy inflation when indeed it’s not.
