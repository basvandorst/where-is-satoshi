Gee, great thanks for telling us. What do you want as a prize from the community: a dildo up your butt or what?

The community decides where to mine, not some fags here. So stop trolling and go away.

Sooner or later a scumbag shows his true colors and Marc Andreessen is no exception. He's no champion of bitcoin as his comments on CNBC proved yesterday. He's just a tool of the US government, a leach who is more upset that Snowden affected how much money his tech companies make rather than the morality of what these scum tech firms are doing with our data and privacy.

You mean like porn stars? what with all their bank accounts being closed by the Obama-led US sharia government?

So what's the point? We should all start running or what? Sorry, I don't get it.

So totally worth it... Many benefits:
1. If the price of BTC stays relatively low, it keeps noobs from buying mining equipment and thus keeps difficulty increments at a manageable 10-15% jumps. More ROI for us, baby
2. No fees at Ghash.io ... so very unlike your BTCGuild which makes nickles and dimes off you
3. By having the price low, it gets us a chance to cheaply accumulate before the greater fools jump in later at higher prices.
4. Yeah sure, choose small pools, so you can suck at finding blocks! Mining at a small pool is the same as using a usb miner to try to find a block.
5. I love Ghash.io ... never had any issues with them. All my 10 antminers are pointed at them and I'm getting another 5 soon to point there as well.

We don't CARE. Now stop trolling. If the 47% of the community is fine with mining at Ghash.io, so am I.
