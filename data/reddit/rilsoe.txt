Story checks out. Am completely chill (but secretly enjoying all the panic). Every time I've checked this sub today it's been with a smile on my face. Human condition manifested :-)

That's it though. Why spend so much time here? What's your motivation? The amount of negative posts and your point of view have clearly been stated and circulated since the crash post December. You cannot be serious that you feel prosecuted here as a nay-sayer when that is now the primary content being upvoted. 
The fact that you don't even believe in it enough to be part of it makes it even more confusing that you want to spend so much energy spreading uncertainty and division. The motivation is confusing and it all seems borderline orchestrated. We get it; you don't believe in crypto. Perhaps go focus on something you do believe in? It's a bit like the meat eater trolling vegan forums repeatedly. 
How can you be the judge of when something is fanatic? What's the line between strong faith in a technology and group mentality? What's your end game? Pulling out investors? And why?

Major difference being that Bitcoin can evolve and adapt because it's code. MP3 players got merged with phones.

You just wrote a statement. I can do the same: "Pigs on LSD will take over the world within 2018."

I don't proclaim to do that either. And neither are these posts you call 'moronic'. This is a subreddit where you share thoughts, ideas and news about a technology heavily driven by enthusiasm, passion AND idealism. If you truly feel like idealism is a "no-no" word in this context, I don't think you fully grasp some of the intentions and goals with e.g. Bitcoin. As if idealism hasn't been a major factor in the global monetary system we see today. 
You call it "scathing blind delusion" or "moronic statements". That again, says a lot about the height of the horse you feel like you're entitled to sit on. All of your statements would directly apply to regular stock market investments as well, and therefore it merely is sitting at a distance firing shots at something that per definition is impossible to predict. It is very, very easy to do and you will absolutely not achieve what you set out to do by just repeatedly shouting "no one knows what's gonna happen".

I am not a native English speaker so apologies for any misspellings (since you felt the need to point it out).
The easiest thing in the world is to sit from a distance and pull something apart. You've been here for 3 days and yet you claim to be an expert in the social mechanics and hysteria of the BC community. You cannot truly emphasize with how it feels to be in on BC, because you chose not to be. Trying to preach that stance to a majority of stakeholders is just... A little sad. Or some type of a saviour complex. You want to make us 'wiser' - can't you hear how self-entitled that sounds? 
Crypto are nothing without idealists and early investors. It took us to 20k and back. Your point of view would just kill the entire tech. Why is that relevant to us? You don't believe in it - good for you and godspeed.

That blockchain could potentially be the future of financial transactions and in that reality there is more than enough room for competition. Or in the same terms you used: there's still both Microsoft and Apple.

People worldwide would not jump at the chance to get paid with bitcoin. No data suggests so. The above blanket statement is complete nonsense.
