OH SNAP! April Fools ... Nice orange sneaks.

So did Chase release the lock after you called them? I had completed several instant buys of $100 at a time previously, but this time, Chase told me: 
"Uh yea, um we really don't like OUR funds being used where they can't be tracked" 
My goal for those funds was to invest in medical research by purchasing CureCoin on the exchanges - instead I suspect I'm now flagged as a drug addict in their system.
Ahhh, the irony of it all.

If one thinks of distributed computing and computational biology as an engine - Curecoin can provide the turbocharger. 
With the right valuation, Curecoin can even fund future research through a feedback loop of donations, thereby allowing it to fund the creation of new work units.
They've had a fledgling effort to crowdfund a Endometriosis Pilot Study using computational biology. Although the project fell short of funding goals, it's collected funds are used as donations to support work sever upgrades for the Pande Group's existing research projects - which is still proving the system works.
Discoveries from protein folding research are just beggining to filter into pharmaceutical design:
The goal is exa-scale computing which means 10x the current participation levels. The question now is, does the community just step up philanthropically, or use CURE et al as incentives, or does F resort to charity from institutional cloud computing donors (which is not as efficient, predictable, distributed or decentralized as global participation from individuals would be).
