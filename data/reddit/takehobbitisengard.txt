lol you guys always default back to these absurd examples.  "hurr durr you don't like firemen and roads?!?"
No genius, we're not saying we don't want to pay any taxes for anything.  There's a grand canyon of difference between paying taxes for roads and firemen and most of the shit the government blows money on nowadays.
Plus most of those actual useful tax sources are state level, not federal.

64% of the budget is blown on social programs, ~15% on the military.  Point your righteous indignation in the correct direction
Edit: downvoters, here ya go.  You're been fed only "discretionary spending" to make it seem like all we do is spend on military, here is the actual total.  My numbers are right.

and who've been working for decades longer then millenials, and who have benefited from a ripping stock market for decades longer, who have been getting a huge transfer of wealth from the great generation (young people in WW2 era) who themselves benefited from a rippin stock market and good economys, etc.

yeah last I heard the IRS's crypto division was like, a couple dozen agents strong.  You gotta be moving around 6-7 figures of crypto/crypto gains to get noticed I'd imagine

who says this is a bull market?  It's still internal of the previous macro high...  bull rally sure, bull market nah, too soon to be making that call.  
This retrace will help decide that, if it finds support and pivots somewhere bullish then it'll be much more settled then it is right now

sigh.  Your salt is showing buddy, you tried to hide it in your last post.  Can't handle how wrong you were.
Literally the first result on google, took 10 seconds to find.  Scroll down to the bottom for the total.

Did you reply to the wrong post or something, lmao, was just pointing out their huge stash of the wealth is about a lot more then "they bought houses awhile ago".
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:38:41
you're right, everyone on the planet knows about bitcoin.
lol.  Your tiny personal anecdote does not make a overarching point my dude.  There's a metric shitload of people even in the western developed world who would go "wut?" if you randomly asked them about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:20:33
not with that attitude it isn't
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:16:37
Could also be right now, tons of people still have no clue what bitcoin is

That's discretionary spending, not the total spending.  A typical bitch move for people who wanna shit on military spending.
Look at the TOTAL spending.

oh well, guess we gotta rely on news articles posted on it instead

nah bro they'll target you for the crypto, which is easily and irreparably moved to their own wallets while they got you and your gf/family tied up and tortured.
Shit has happened a lot already, you would not be the first or the last.  Don't broadcast 6 figure crypto ownership online.

risk vs reward.  Safe and lucrative rarely co-exist.

you aren't actually storing the btc on the usb stick, the bitcoin is on the block chain.... the usb is just the security device for that btc, basically.
@_date: 2019-11-05 13:53:05
you need to fucking delete everything, this thread, all your comments, this reddit account, throw out the computer you used, change your IP address, move the crypto off that robinhood acct for fuck's sake.  Burn it all to the fucking ground then keep your goddamn mouth shut about your crypto holdings.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:41:43
what was your excuse when bitcoin dumped 85% while traditional markets pumped?
Bet you were reallll quiet then, lmao.
They aren't correlated, AKA they do their own things irrespective of one another.
@_date: 2019-08-10 03:11:50
I still contend that they kicked off the BTC bear.  They stripped away all the korean exchanges without warning at once and dropped the marketcap significantly overnight.
Looking at the MC chart at the time it went from nice and smooth/stable to chaos and dumpage after they did that, totally unsettled the market and it never recovered, basically shanked it's confidence.
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:21:44
it is a coincidence.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:00:15


shorting is always limited in it's return capability vs longing, that goes for all assets/trade-able things.
In a extreme example that illustrates the point, if you short something to 0 you'll have a whole lot of 0.

@_date: 2019-08-06 02:34:24
did you seriously just try to claim that money moving out of bitcoin pumped the traditional markets?  Pls tell me you didn't do that, lmao.
Apple alone is a trillion dollar market cap company (not anymore but was at one point).... bitcoin is nothing to the traditionals, a little tiny speck.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:52:42
all dumps start somewhere ;)
Besides why use 3k as a metric, who tf would still be positive if it went back to like 4k.. "still up from 3k bud, sry"
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:04:15
your misunderstanding of market cap vs the actual amount of USD invested into btc solidifies that
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:35:57
nah I'm good, only reason I stuck around this long was to bury you with my screenshot reply since you were being such a childish insufferable douchebag about it.  
I made my point and now I'm gone, some friendly advice though from someone who's almost assuredly fucked more women and has a way larger net worth:  Grow the fuck up, quality women don't like broke manbabies that can't even handle getting proven wrong by a random stranger on the internet.

you sad, sad little person.  It's a video of her legit saying it, it's not a CT it's just there for all to see. 
You don't want to see it because it'll fuck over your little echo chamber bubble's worldview where the left is a paragon of virtue and it's only the big bad Russians and the right who would dare meddle in an election.
Also, do you know who came up with the term conspiracy theory?
The CIA.  To help discredit anyone who got too close to figuring out all the evil twisted shit they were up to.  You're not in good company throwing that around lmao
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:25:37
I notice you totally side stepped the rest of my point re: Google and the censoring fascist left.
And sry CIA didn't literally invent the term, but they popularized it.

Hillary Clinton wanted to open up firearm companies to suits/fines/penalties when their products were used in a mass shooting/crime, and half the country did their damndest to elect her potus soo.... maybe a lot of people are kinda stupid lol.  Might as well do the same to car companies over drunk driving, the precedent it would've set would be ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:55:40
what part of "she didn't deny it" do you not understand?
Why are you defending google planning to meddle in our elections?  Are you okay with it, cheering it on even?  
I bet you have talked alllll kinds of shit about Russia having some small troll farms in '16 messing w/ our election.  Suddenly not so fun now that it's your crew doing it, eh?

the tether part is tinfoil hat theory but the CME one is verified, one of the big wigs admitted that the Trump admin greenlit the futures to pop the bubble by introducing wall st shorters to the market which up till then was full of moonboys/long biased people.

very little btc was exchanged at the tippy top, c'mon people....
Majority of the topping volume was right where btc ran into a brick wall on this last pump: 12-14k
@_date: 2019-12-06 14:35:15
devil's advocate:  If you had this approach after the '14 washout you would be selling and getting rekt for years as price bull ran it's way to 20k.
Sometimes there just are no more weak hands and you're in a new bull cycle, we'll see with where we're at rn but I'll tell ya this, if price capitulates down into 4.5-5.5k you better fucking buy
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:58:17
did you, or did you not watch the video of the google exec.....?
Simple question.  She flat out said that shit, it wasn't doctored.  She didn't deny it.

lemme guess, you think market cap is actual fiat money that's invested right?
Cause that's not how it works at all.  
Also what broken market trends are you referring too?
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:04:01


why tf would they think that?  You realistically don't "lose" more then ~2% a year holding USD, bitcoin can tank 50% plus ez
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:51:04
People fly those drones you dumb fuck.  They don't fly themselves.
And you can't control a population with drones, you do that with boots on the ground.
You are severely underestimating the power of 100 million+ well armed and unified people fighting on their home turf with the support of a fractured off military (yes, the U.S military would not unify around a tyrannical government ordering it to bomb/murder U.S civilians).  But as I said you're clearly a dumbass with zero real world knowledge on this topic so shouldn't be surprised.
@_date: 2019-09-09 14:26:41


lmfao do you even Afghan war bro?  Bunch of uneducated towelheads in caves with AK-47s have been giving the U.S military issues for a decade+.
North Vietnamese are also having a laugh at you.
You clearly know absolute fuck all about this topic, should probably just refrain from pretending otherwise.
Pro tip:  Military can't control anyone with fighter jets and tanks, that requires soldiers on the corner and marching the street to keep order and oppression.  And the more they'd bomb American citizens with those jets the less support they would have and the more unified the People would become.  Also, if they went full total war on America they would end up ruling over a ash heap.  They wouldn't destroy their own infrastructure and country.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:08:21
lmfao what is this garbage....


Literally what the U.S is.  Castle doctrine, in most places in the U.S you would be within your legal rights to blow this guy away as soon as he got into your house.  Just camp out with a AR-15 aimed at the door, he breaks in, dump 30 rounds into him and you're fine.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:58:58
who said that's it's only purpose?  Shit can have more then one use/meaning ya know...
100 million well armed people will take down a tyrannical government with it's 1 million soldiers (at best, since a lot will defect/refuse to follow orders).
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:07:42
thanks I just caught autism from this post.
Just admit that you are uncomfortable with the fact that you are a peasant serf living under the rule of your government with zero way to change that if the government doesn't want it to be changed and move the fuck on, this is just sad.
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:03:02
yeh castle doctrine seems like a no-brainer law that every free country should have on the books.  Don't break into other people's homes and you won't have a issue.
