I got my funds recover from bitfinex. If you messed up at bittrix exchange under 5k it's 70 percent a lost. You can try to get ahold of them on Reddit and twitter. Post up your ticket number there hopefully they get back to you

I've sent all my bch to my btc bitfinex wallet awhile ago, Once I notice I made the mistake after 30 mins I sent a support ticket to bitfinex, they were really backed up at the time. I messaged them on Reddit and on twitter, after 2 days I got back a reply from them saying they will try to recover it for me but not all funds are recoverable and I was having a hard time sleeping because I screwed up really bad on this one. 3 days later still no reply or update on recovering my funds, I went on reddit again and saw a guy complaining about his mistake too and he got his funds recovered after a few hours of his post. I wrote my support ticket number under his and asked nicely if they can help me check up on my recovery status, 3 hours later I received all my bch back and they just took 25 bucks fee from my big mistake. I wish you the best of luck on recovering your funds

About a month ago I did the same mistake. I've sent bch to btc wallet on bitfinex, the amount was nerve wrecking and I couldn't sleep the whole week because it was a huge deal, lucky bitfinex got back to me in a few days and helped me recover my funds and they charged me 25 fee. I was incrediablly lucky to get it all back. Best of luck to you on getting your funds back, I've learn my lesson
