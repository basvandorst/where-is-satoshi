“Stealing hashpower” is an interesting way to put it. The problem is BTC has been slow before the BCH fork, so that theory doesn’t really hold up. You are still not getting the basic market appeal to Bitcoin Cash which is that the transactions are objectively faster and cheaper, adoption will naturally occur because of lower costs and convenience. But yeah let’s just keep ignoring simple economics and stick with the theory that Roger Ver has launched an attack on BTC where 80% of his own assets are held lol

What were you able to buy with Bitcoin from 2008 - 2011?

The title of Satoshi’s white paper is “Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System”. Nowhere in the white paper does it mention a store of value or digital gold. Now if you start using Bitcoin in the way Satoshi intended, you’d go broke from paying absurd transaction fees. Fun fact: it’s cheaper and more efficient to use Visa or Western Union instead of Bitcoin to make transactions.

Why would anyone want to own bitcoin they can actually use to buy things with that doesn't cost more in transaction fees than the product they are buying? Fuckin fraudsters!

Hodlers have to hodl cuz they would go broke if they actually used bitcoin to make transactions, which is what its original intent was. So you are right that it serves no utility other than being a digital store of value.

Yet here we are still buying the narrative that he is plotting an attack against BTC, where 80% of his assets are held, just so he can increase the value of a coin where less than 20% of his assets are held...makes sense.

You know, Dash and ETC also pumped up to 40% while BCH was pumping, were the same boogeymen behind those pumps too? Also if it was meant as a plotted attack against Bitcoin, why haven't any of those tokens dumped yet?

Yes pretty much useless as a means of digital cash. This is why it’s only a store of value at this point.

That slogan is based on the economic principle I just mentioned. It’s not about Starbucks not accepting BCH. It’s about transaction fees in general. “Try to donate $20 to someone and see how much of it they actually receive”

Fun fact: it’s cheaper and more efficient to use Visa or Western Union instead of Bitcoin to send money to someone . Literally the title of Satoshi’s white paper is “Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System”. Nowhere in the white paper does it mention a store of value or digital gold. Now if you start using Bitcoin in the way Satoshi intended, you’d go broke from paying absurd transaction fees.

No its not, the main argument is that its way cheaper and faster to make transactions, regardless of what type of transaction. Would you rather pay less than a cent to donate $20 to someone or donate $20 and have them only receive $14 of it? It's a matter of basic economics really.
