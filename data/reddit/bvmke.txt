Who's insecure?  You don't know me or what I'm worth and that's how normal society functions.

Naturally I could ask the same thing.  I'm guessing you dont casually bring up your net worth at dinner parties though, just on r/Bitcoin.  You should try it though, I think your friends will love it.

Inflation arguments aside, money does actually buy more happiness when you're young and healthy.

((12 months of HODLing) AND (Mom's basement) OR (Trust fund)) = $237,000 net worth at 27.  Either way, posting your balance sheet on reddit is braggadocio.  This should be talked about with friends and advisors, not posted publically.  Zero class.

Or bright minds crack crypto currency like they've cracked every cryptography prior.
That said, keep your hypothetical portfolio balanced and you should be fine

Aaaand now the real point of your humblebrag post comes out.  Did I question what rich is?  Did anyone?  You're bringing that up just like you brought your fake balance sheet to a Bitcoin forum.  You even worked in that you have a high income, in fact the only thing you failed to add is that you have a huge dick and a hot girlfriend. 
"Here's what happens if you speculated in Bitcoin a year ago.  Also my family has millions in wealth and I'm amassing my own wealth and feel compelled to share this shit with anonymous people for validation"
Uncouth.
