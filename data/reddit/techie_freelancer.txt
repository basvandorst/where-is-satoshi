I recently purchased an FPV simulator with Bitcoin,

I think people are scared to sell their Bitcoin in case they can't get them back at the same price?  It really is very similar to gold.

Call me a conspiracy theorist but if I didn't know better I'd say that this is an attempt by certain intelligence agencies to manipulate the Bitcoin market.

I have a Jeep too but mine is a TJ.  Awesome car I love it so much.

Same here where is this?
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:49:31
Haha it got me too.

I'm thinking January / February.  There's only 7 1/2 weeks left of the year and the dips can take a while to recover from.

Real Estate is the big one to be disrupted in my opinion.  Why would anyone want to own an investment property that they have to repair, insure, look after tenants etc when they now have a safe storage of money that realises capital gains in their pocket?  
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:54:49
I think it makes sense because if people are selling their other assets to buy bitcoin then you will see the correction in gold, real estate etc while btc goes to the moon.

Watch the Antopoulos video from Ubud Bali he talks about scaling and reaching a point where transactions can be streamed, as someone who works in distributed computing I think he was spot on with this talk.

I really respect that you have taken the time to make this response!  Different scenarios is precisely what I'm trying to calculate.  Now I can easily add this to a spreadsheet with the carry over, thanks!
Edit: In case anyone is wondering this [works a treat](  In D2 put `=((A2+B2)*C2)` and A3 `=D2`, paste into 12 rows, fill in the blanks and you can play around with the scenarios.

Por que no los dos?

Man this is such an awesome thing to do.  I wonder do they do a body building camp?  
Edit: Looking at the website it looks like they do, cool.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:24:00
Yes but not in the way you think.

Thanks for the warning, much appreciated!

Hopefully in 3 years a bank will no longer be necessary...  Good luck regardless!

Any legit company that's operating transparently can still be taxed.   Only thing that will change is that the government can't just print money to pay for things.

Independent Reserve, not for any particular reason but they were the first to verify me so I stuck with them.  Just checked and the limit is indeed $5000 with Poli deposits:

I do it because it's fun :)

I ordered a card from Xapo and one day after it arrived they sent me an email saying that all cards to non-Euro citizens will be revoked in October.  No mention of a refund or anything.
Bitpay isn't much better, as I ordered two cards from them and only one of them arrived.
Note that neither of these companies responded to my emails to support.  Is there a better option?  TenX perhaps?

Sure they're pretty scammy but it's better to have crowdfunded ICOs than it is to depend on VC investment from a small select group of people who will put their own interests ahead of everything else.
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:07:20


Doesn't sound correct to me, when I last signed up to an exchange pretty sure I had a $5000AUD daily limit...?  Are you properly verifying yourself or trying to stay anonymous?
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:48:28
Nobody actually possesses physical Bitcoins in the form of data, rather it's a ledger system that delegates ownership to a unique private key.  So really the private key on the paper just proves your ownership and rights to them, it's not actually a Bitcoin.  I think everyone gets confused by this at first, myself included :)
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:06:06
Wow this looks very cool thanks

I was there for four years across almost all countries (except Venezuela sadly) and I don't think I ever saw anywhere that let you put toilet paper in the toilet.

You can put half the private key or seed in a safe deposit box, if something happens to you they will give the contents to your next of kin (I believe).

This is me pretty much haha.

Is this why my TV keeps crashing everytime I go to a streaming site?  Started about a week ago, it's happening on my phone as well when I try to stream but my laptop has no issue.

IMO we're long overdue for a global economic crisis and this will drive a lot of people towards Bitcoin.  So much debt right now and interest rates are going up next year for sure.  I think what you'll see is people selling their assets, buying Bitcoin and declaring themselves bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:43:25
If you get paid in Bitcoin then you will have to spend it.  At the moment it doesn't make much sense to buy Bitcoin with your cash then use it to buy other things, unless Bitcoin is the only option to make the purchase.

To be fair, they're cruisers made for cruising.  Very tractable torque but heavy and low horsepower compared to any kind of sport bikes.
