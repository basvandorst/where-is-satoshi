It is pretty nice for your geeky side, I use it on a change wallet.

I wonder if they get to spam for them. They are good at it.
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:40:22
I'll have to agree on this one. I have dealt with coinurl and they do pay as promised, but really not worth the hassle when there are far better ways to monetize webpages. If $5-10 worth of BTC is your thing though, enjoy.

So what are your thoughts on reddcoin barfing out a few billion coins the first few blocks and calling it a IPCO?

Jefrey Smith with his liberal arts degree is the most rogue employee there.

I'll give you $5 in BTC for it.

Mr. Smith and CEX are not fond of making spontaneous statements. They must be trite and prepared.

Attention to those little details, (i.e. reducing spam) is what makes it such a great app.
@_date: 2014-07-22 15:12:58
That is part of it's charm. But that's just me, I am a if it isn't broken don't fix it type.

It doesn't always, I grant you that, but the discussion of why premined coins are a bad idea have been discussed here and on bitcointalk more than I care to remember.  is the latest I could find with a cursory search.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:21:58
A great number of coins were produced in the first few blocks, pretty much making it a premine.
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:24:26
I imagined you saying that like this: 
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:39:40
35 BTC and the website is made with Weebly. ROFL
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:06:44
Same here, I was all ready to try a new platform but obviously someone broke it before I got the chance.
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:58:28
in b4 bowtie run.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:57:35
That liberal arts degree from a defunct Ukranian university sure has served you well, Smith.

They are trying to set a record for the biggest tl;dr in reddit history.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:44:17
So too like Gox they shall fall.
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:09:09
I am just shocked to see a great, in-depth article from Techcrunch. ^^
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:01:30
Like TradeFortress and inputs.io You can't make your authority/network.
@_date: 2014-07-10 10:42:23
I have to agree on the headings, if you don't do away with them, at least make them scroll or something. But not at all the worst site I have seen. Had a guy in here yesterday attempting to sell a weebly site for the equivalent of $25,000 US.
@_date: 2014-07-10 11:43:56
Seems people still haven't learned the lessons that instawallet and inputs.io taught.
