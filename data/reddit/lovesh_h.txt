Intro to the Bulletproofs API from dalek's implementation and some example circuits like proving a number is in certain bound [a, b], set membership, set non-membership, etc

Yes but that would require a ECDSA signature verification circuit which can be expensive. The idea would be to select a "bunch of bitcoin addresses", all with balance &gt;= "certain amount of bitcoin" and then prove that you **know** the signature on a challenge and the signature can be verified using one of the public keys. It is important to prove that you know but not reveal the signature as revealing the signature would reveal the public key too. Larger the "bunch of bitcoin addresses", greater the privacy but also worse the performance as signature verification happens for each address. Secondly, the challenge can be a hash of the anonymity set, i.e. "bunch of bitcoin addresses" to make it non-interactive

It is indeed called "discreet" as the contract details are hidden from the chain.

No worries.

Yes, you are correct. Thank you. I fixed my post.

Would bulletproofs be efficient for range proofs other than interval \[0, 2\^n), like prove 3 &lt; x &lt; 15 or 18 &lt; x &lt; 100
