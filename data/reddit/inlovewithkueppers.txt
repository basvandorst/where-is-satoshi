Is see certain parallels with the dudes trying to block pirate websites.
If these guys truly stand for open software, they wouldn't be doing shit like that.

That was exactly my first experience.
Asked for help in a Java forum and detailed what I had tried out, what could've worked, but didn't and what exactly I was having trouble with. Furthermore I stated even a pointer in the right direction would be very helpful.  
What I got was condescending responses and a "holier than though" attitude from the users.
Next one came in some linux forum where I asked a question in the same manner and got vile responses. Then a patch to mercurial was ridiculed and "corrected" - the correction just added more variables and had a longer commit message.  
Mercurial is dead to me now, no matter how easy it is to use. Fuck it and it's devs - that dev in particular. Long live git.
I also spoke to people at linux user groups and they really didn't like noobs. Most of them talked about how stupid people were for using Mac or Windows, but insulted them in the same breath for attempting to switch to Linux. "We don't need noobs and lusers".  
I will never understand the linux community and might rile against them till my dieing day. But yeah... fuck Mac and Windows.

Why do so many people take nudes of themselves?

From what I understand, this one has quite a few subsidiaries.
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:36:45
Good. I hope they confirm this.
Fuck those guys. They took 1k off me for a product that lasted a week. Fuck them.

Looks like a few bank accounts will be moving in the near future.

Sent them an RMA, but I want a refund. It'll take them another lifetime to produce and ship. By then the hash power will be ridiculous compared to whatever will be on the market (3TH by KnCMining).
The way I see it, it's either they spend money making a new one or simply send the money to me.

That's exactly wtf I'm going to do. BFL is destroying the bitcoin experience for so many people and just making bad press for those interested in it. They should be ashamed.

Lucky you. Mine broke a week after beginning to mine &gt;_&lt;

Do I understand this correctly, it's basically a Greasemonkey script to browser extension uh... compiler?
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:04:41
What's reasoning and sense behind this? Aren't they just donating money?
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:19:01
BFL is basically spoiling the bitcoin experience. Got mine recently and I'll be earning shit with it. But at least I'll learn how to setup a server and securing it, so I've got that going for me. Other than that, fuck that company.
Could we please put up a notice/advisory against buying their shit for everyone to see on this subreddit?

Magnanimous, munificent, magnificent mondays!
I ain't complaining just voicing an impression.
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:41:35


Yes, that'll get them asking questions!
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:39:04
First time I've seen it. It might just be me, but it seems unfitting to call a day "moronic" then tell people not to feel stupid when asking questions. Why else would the day be moronic, if the only clue you gave to it's uh.. moronicness / foolishness was a quite possibly snarky and sarcastic one about stupid questions.
It's like saying "This day sucks, because of your foolish questions, but go on, ask them without feeling stupid." With a mischievous grin on your face.

I wasn't aware Greasemonkey was obsolete :S I'm pretty out of the loop there.
Is the code for the example project ("sink") up? I'd just like to get a clearer idea of it.

Does this get you a refund?
