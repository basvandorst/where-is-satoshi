And what a revolution in decentralization it's promising to be. :(

Giving good definitions of words helps immensely when communicating and when discussing things. 
Redefining words can sometimes be useful, but if you don't make it explicit, it's only confusing.

No, because ASCII doesn't describe the notion of an eighth bit, or multiple bytes. 
His descriptions of forwards and backwards compatibility read like textbook examples of the concepts. If soft-forks started using another definition of backward compatibility that makes that version correct, that wasn't a smart choice.

If a fork was backwards-incompatible, it would fail to parse the ledger from the start, so of course it's going to be backwards compatible.
The "cool" feature is when older clients can still read the newer transactions. Excel95 not crashing when it's able to read excel97-files isn't good enough, it should also be able to compute the formulas correctly (or with the same results). If that were to work, the changes in the file-format would be forward-compatible.
If you can't guarantee that the formulas will be correct, then you're not doing anyone a favor by making a file-format that will leave excel95 reading the file, unaware that it's broken (and not summing correctly). You're better off having excel95 say "This file is too new, please buy excel97". Excel97 can still read the .x95 files, since excel97 is backwards compatible.
With a soft-fork, the transactions get new behavior, old-versioned software might not compute the correct results, but will not complain. They'll just think they received money when actually they missed the 'crossed-my-fingers-so-i-could-lie'-bit.

Isn't that because the rate of transactions is too low? If within 3 minutes 1TB of transactions arrive (8MB would be less futuristic), wouldn't many miners merge these into their block? and build on that with the next 8MB of transactions minutes later? Why would these get orphaned?

It's still open source. If at any point bitcoin-core realizes they want BIP101 too (either because XT got supermajority, or maybe the workshops revealed some new information), they can just copy the patch over and have it too.
If Gavin and Hearn get in a disagreement, one can kick the other and the other can start Bitcoin-AT, and you could see who upgrades on which path. All implementation that "lose" a hardfork implement the feature and are back business. 
All of this works better if the various developers (core, XT, AT) are on speaking terms, but as long as they communicate through BIPs, and their source is available, it's easy and acceptable to copy some parts over.

As a complete bystander, i think it does matter. You need some indication of technical merit and involvement. If the others have been working full-time on it, that works in their favor.
In the end the open source motto "show me the code" is a very good one to me. You don't need just the philosophers and the amateur-experts, you need people who can make it work, and who can explain why they made their design choices. Bitcoin XT seems more mature in that respect. For monetary systems to collapse because of inaction and political debates, we don't need bitcoin to repeat that experiment.

A $400 smartphone is not expensive. An iPhone, or top of the line Samsung is double that.
I'd say it's a midrange cellphone.

Thanks for the clarification!

To have a point with your starttime, have others done more than Gavin or Hearn?

If the growth of bitcoin is small, there will just be no blocks that are close to max size?
What's the downside of allowing 16MB blocks in 2019 when only 3kb blocks are generated because there weren't more transactions? (Compared to allowing 2 MB blocks which also isn't reached).
@_date: 2015-09-03 06:22:38
So it's not about *time used* or *work done*, but about knowing the system more deeply now?
From some talks I saw with Hearn (years ago), he seemed to have a pretty thorough understanding of how it works technically, and he had very compelling ideas about what might be done in the future. As lead-maintainer for a long time, I'm sure Gavins technical-knowledge on bitcoin must be almost unparalleled. Maybe their knowledge is getting outdated, but I'd be surprised if they don't read all BIPs that get produced (but that goes for way more people).
Even then, personally, I have a lot of respect for people who started working on bitcoin when it wasn't popular yet, and basically enabled it to become as popular as it is now. People who jump in on a successful product, they might do enormous amounts of work,  but to me that work will indeed seem insignificant to the work that was done early days.
Similarly, if Satoshi showed up with an opinion, I'd consider that a very important opinion, despite the fact that they didn't do anything for the last years.
I can see why it generates bad blood with the new people though, because to bystanders their opinion won't be as relevant, and it's a gateway to [Argumenting from Authority].(
I think for the BIPs, it doesn't matter as much where you are now, it matters how you see the bitcoin-economy to be in 5 years. Everything/most on main chain, do small  things externally. 
All sides should probably write some good accessible medium-articles about how they envision the future of bitcoin, how the various BIPs connect to that.
