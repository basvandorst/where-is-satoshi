The bitcoin is meant to be spent and exchanged, just like the dragon is born to fly and burn things to ashes.

Before you start working on your husband's computer (or any other electronic media he could have used to store the wallet), make sure to create a bit-by-bit copy (two of them) and store them in a secure location, accessible only by you. Because HDDs, SSDs and flash drives fail quite often. Second, its computer might offer other passwords and/or password hints (evidence of account ownership at bitcoin exchanges, links to places with backup copies of his wallet, etc.), which you may need to seek.
Then, to your question.

Things can go very wrong, if the substantial amount of bitcoin is discovered. Imagine that your husband had a 100 of them. A smart thief would give you 1-2 and go away with the rest. A greedy thief would go away with the whole sum... and you won't be able to prove anything.
\&gt;For example, is it possible to accidentally lock the account? 
Which account? An e-mail account can be restored by answering a secret question or by e-mailing a 'password reset' link to a backup e-mail. In the worst case scenario you can always approach an e-mail services provider and request ownership over your husband's account.
\&gt;My family member did contact Bitgo for me to ask about what a widow can do in these situations and they didn't sound very helpful. 
I believe you may sue them. Even a threat of this can make them very helpful.
\&gt;Obviously, I would be able to provide a death certificate, if necessary, but I don't know that that even seems to matter. 
It matters at the court.
