I don't think you understand how this works. ChangeTip is still centralized IOU system, they funds are stored away in multisig addresses. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:24:37
Trying this out now!
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:01:38
I've been looking for the video, it's been taken down.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:27:44
I get your point, I just wish we didn't reward the "IOU" with "no privacy" options just because they have lots of VC money to look legit. Let's get everyone a fair chance.
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:07:16
Sweet, there is quite a bit in there. I will be looking out for reviews when it launches. Very likely to get one. I want to use it to generate and hold my multisig keys.
@_date: 2014-12-08 04:38:22
Hi, will this work with Multi-signature wallets like Coinkite, Bitgo and Greenaddress?
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:21:09
Move to a multi-signature wallet and start sleeping better.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:14:03
Great job Under **Securing your bitcoin** you should list all the wallets here  this would be more fare, I could make the case that Circle and Coinbase are IOU systems and the coins are not yours.
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:50:31
It was taken down, do you have another link? 
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:37:47
It's not compromised, the issue is incompetence with the sites using it.
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:13:53
What is the price?
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:42:28
Nice! Easy and secure wallets with privacy and a couple options of how to spend. 
should make this exact bullet points the top most thing on the sticky FAQ. 
You deserve some gold!
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:26:40
199, pricey. What else do I get with it? Pitch :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:46:32
Wasn't from me
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:54:24
Stop using phone apps for money you can't lose. Use a more robust multisig wallet like Coinkite or Electrum. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:15:41
This is very disappointing
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:53:55
Sweet. I had just finished my original 3 pack. Ordered another 12! 
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:45:23
Ok Mr Localbitcoin, ROFL @ dowry.
@_date: 2015-04-01 03:17:07
Get a better wallet, see [here]( and [here](
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:02:07
I believe it does. I think BTChip/HW.1/Ledger are all the same hardware. You need the new firmware, just RTFM.
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:40:52
Buy on Circle =&gt; Multsig elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:55:57
Wrote to him, explain why he should.
Try Privacy Badger from the EFF, works very well.
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:00:48
Thanks for the update
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:40:19
Thanks this is helpful.
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:05:28
This is a link bait. You cannot tell how bitcoin is being used from the public ledger. Transaction volume has consistently increased and the number of startups is growing everyday. Just looks at  and 
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:41:36
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:11:06
Nice. I saw a bunch on smaller subs, when was the original here? I missed it. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 14:09:14
Now just imagine if a state in the USA tried to ban the EURO because they didn't like it. Nice to have a currency that can't be controlled by guns.
@_date: 2015-03-29 13:02:49
No one uses it. 
Would love to but i have to give them Facebook or Twitter access, no privacy.
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:02:35
WTF are you talking about, people are using, more apps are bring created and transaction volume is growing!
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:20:09
I really hope these two get the ETF out, it will make a huge price bump.
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:18:20
Nice to see Toronto locals pushing the envelope, I hope to see you guys at Tonight's meetup! 
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:56:30
Cool, I will see you there Anthony!
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:29:24
had a [great discussion yesterday]( on this






@_date: 2015-03-02 19:04:37
Neat, how can I setup a escrow transactions using this?
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:50:24
Big fan of Armory and [Coinkite]( Multi-signaure is the only way going forward!
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:09:06
It's a true border-less currency that governments can't control.
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:05:07
Finally! Works great on mobile safari for me.
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:47:46
Buy on Quadriga store on Coinkite multisig.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:54:48
I do use 3/6 a lot, neat system. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:56:12
There are hundreds. Mostly brick and mortar exchanges and there are companies white labeling the terminals so it's not listed on the map.
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:12:08
Neat the payment pages work with Tor.
