When I was reading about it, bitcoin-qt needed to download gigabytes of data to work, whereas Electrum didn't.

What's the danger in having more than two transactions per public address?

I see, so that's 'change' as in the stuff that gets lost down your couch.

Forgive me if I'm reluctant to give out addresses at this point, as I'm not 100% confident in what I'm meant to keep to myself, and what is meant to be made public.

All I needed was patience. It's taken about 45 minutes, with Electrum being connected the whole time, but my balance is now back to what I started with.
The address in the 'Imported' directory is at 0 BTC, and the first address in the 'Receiving' directory has all my bitcoins.
Just to clarify then, Electrum has created a *wallet*, which is a file that exists only on my PC, which includes five *public addresses* which I can freely distribute to solicit payments? I'm still getting my head around all these mixed metaphors.

blockchain.info says the transaction has 11 confirmations, and lo-and-behold it's back in my wallet.

My think the issue is I didn't fully understand the UI of Electrum, and which strings of text meant what.
Who have I sent those bitcoins to? What are the five addresses in the 'Receiving' directory for? The same questions applies for the addresses in the 'Change' directory.

Patience was all I needed, it seems. Do transactions into my public address normally take around 45 minutes to propagate around the network and back?

You'll have to explain that proof part to me, I don't understand :/

Because I want to use local software on my PC. I tend to avoid the cloud where I can.
