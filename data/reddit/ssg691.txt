i agree with you and i too have zero cost basis btc .but only problem is i have to now pay taxes on the bitcoin i hold so if it goes to zero i loose the money i paid in tax , say i hold 1m$ of btc i have to pay ~30-40% of that as taxes this year . so if btc goes to zero i will loose 300k,400k
@_date: 2017-02-16 19:19:54
yea i get you. i should do that i have like 16 btc atm . thanks a lot mate 
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:00:05

@_date: 2017-02-08 13:17:52

@_date: 2017-02-03 20:14:41
ok thanks for clearing it up. i was confused . :)
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:55:55
i dont have to send manually . i have to send via api . that means whenever somebody send goods to me i get notification via api . now i want to trigger sending of bitcoins i have the following variables (address to send , amount of btc , fees ) now  i need to send the bitcoin to the address automatically thats why i need api . coinbase has one but it uses default fees automatically i need to change fees .
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:02:56
  this transaction
15AxG8xoxP8AsFmBVtxE1ijz7cNS5AL52u senders address
mine address 1JKFiPLzW23ZKJ6FsvTsrCc9W91skzTp8n 
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:26:14
yea i think u are right its utxo . but the fees on my transaction is highest among all the unconfirmed ones . and it should be confirmed in 1 block like others . but still it hasnt 
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:20:46
but the fees is much high if u see bitcoin21fees . the transaction should confirm in 1  block . and 5-6 blocks have been mined after that transaction .
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:34:04
i submitted the other transaction to viabtc accelerator . not mine cause the accelerator said my tx was not valid . in the next block the other tx got confirmed and the guy sent me another payment .
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:55:32
shows the same with me
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:19:58
**SH ?
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:23:52
yea thats mine transaction . according to bitcoin21fees it should confirm in 1 block . theres already been 10 blocks after that transaction . he sent me 3 other transaction as well with same fees and all confirmed in 1 block .
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:14:52

Download electrum on a vps ? setup a wallet and then  i will transfer some bits to that wallet.  now i just need to send payments to some addresses sometimes .

bro i came to realise after i posted . calm down . i have been reading about bitcoin the whole day cause of this failure . these comments helped me understand .
@_date: 2016-06-15 08:21:24
bro i get it i payed less fees . thats my first time this happened . i am never gonna pay this less of a fees ever .
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:55:52
mine also has . i am too stingy i choose the lowest fees . now i regret .

@_date: 2016-06-15 11:13:20
ya bro . i didnt know earlier now i will . Mempool has increased significantly from last few days .
@_date: 2016-06-15 08:21:56
any way i can cancel this and send a new one :(
@_date: 2016-06-15 08:24:28
0.0002 . i have had higher transaction at less fess going through easily . didnt know this gonna happen . For this consider this transaction a higher transaction at 0.0001 fees went through its mine . thats why i didnt give more fees cause i thought it well get through as well .
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:26:06
nice man . i use bitcoins to buy and sell "some things" i had around 3 btc when the bitcoin hit 630$ so now i am selling everything and buying bitcoins 
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:19:53
i delibrately choose the low fees option . which i guess shouldnt do it for large transaction . now what should i do just wait ? or anyway to cancel it ?
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:13:42
i have 2 questions it will be great if you can answer or provide a source to read.
2.2 sat/byte!? why did the miners mine this transaction? did they keep aside their economic incentives and just did it to show that block size can be increased by including this transaction ? Or will fees really go down to this level ?
Also if segwit actually increases the block size then why not just increase the block size to 2 mb and lets not get segwit ? cause we were not increasing the size so that it remain decentralised right ?
Edit: thanks for downvotes people cant even answer questions in this know it all subreddit
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:17:42
i think the problem is mainly due to wallets not telling people exactly what they are gonna do . they should tell people . that sir u must pay this much fees to confirm . else it might take this much hours.  if only this happened there wouldnt be a problem .
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:30:54
no but how long does it take to gradually delete from a netowrk ?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:44:31
do you mean this ?  
is there any example code i can work on pybitcointools had such an easy example to get me started .
@_date: 2017-01-24 12:04:39
how did u prove that u made the transaction ?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:56:33
how can i see that ?
@_date: 2017-01-24 14:42:10
ok thanks . didnt know that.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:36:09
seriously man this guy wasted my 5 minutes reading through that site only to discover a product that is nothing less then a bitcoin/alt wallet .

hi . i am an indian here . and i am buying stuff in india and selling it online for btc and cashing it . Trying to figure out how i can send a wire deposit to bitstamp and buy btc from there .
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:01:43
sarcasm ?
@_date: 2016-11-06 06:51:38
i have access to lots of people willing to sell and buy bitcoin from me . Also if the answer of this question is that the 3rd party apis are reliable enough . then i could code the exchange in a week . Also i have learnt that one of the exchanges in my country is using bitgo since 2 years .  Also i believe in learning and building rather then give up .
@_date: 2016-11-02 20:54:37
@_date: 2016-11-09 03:36:03
i think bitcoin literacy in india is low as of now so it shouldnt affect bitcoin .

i am unable to create segwit transactions with the library i use . ( i hope somebody extends this library so i can start using segwit .
@_date: 2016-11-06 07:26:56
the third party apis also give the confirmations count of each txID . i could use that to confirm the transactions ? 3 confirmations is good enough ?
@_date: 2016-11-02 08:28:43
too much fees 6% makes my plan goes waste but thanks

@_date: 2016-11-08 15:47:42
how will it affect bitcoin ?
@_date: 2016-11-03 15:48:23
But will it wait 10 mins for 1 confirmation?
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:15:04
before the fork there is just one btc so. you cant invest in wrong one .
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:51:11
thanks for the method now all i have to do is to keep sending btc to my addresses and hope sometimes i get one on this address and other on that .
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:48:06
oh i see . it may seem pain in the ass right now but if needed people can make tools to do this easily . wow then we are getting 2 coins afterall.
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:26:57
rate is high plus unreliable . looking to get 2-3 sellers who i can trust and buy regularly .
@_date: 2016-02-25 14:03:05
i just read somewhere and had no basis for saying that . sorry for that .
My preference is too deal with 1-2 guys regularly since it will involve sending payments directly to his account without even reaching me . my clients will send money directly to him . and i will take the bitcoins . 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:26:22
you dont even need to buy a new one .the seed can generate your private keys and you can use any other wallet to spend them . but buying a new one is the most easiest technical way .
