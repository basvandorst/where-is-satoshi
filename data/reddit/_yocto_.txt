thanks, and lets hope for the best.

1) you wanna bet?
2) value has nothing to do with Casinos. Its supply and demand.
There are X new Bitcoins available per day. The more people buy them, the more value they get. The less people buy them, the less value they have.
In time, the price should stabilize; which price? I have no idea!!

@_date: 2013-12-12 08:52:54
yes. Trading with Bitcoin brings off a big part of transactional costs. In a global economy, where Banks are moving all the money between currencies, Bitcoin would leave them off the chain, reducing costs, and either increasing the profits or indeed, decreasing the price.

It is hard to say and argue. Mostly because many people are buying and selling the same Bitcoins every 15 minutes. We could in theory hit the 50bm mark next month or by next summer, who knows.
I think the key is acceptance by ordinary business: movie theaters, stadiums, concerts, restaurants, you name it.
As long as Bitcoin remains mainly for trading and not actually for buying, you can bring a couch and sit cozy, because it´s gonna take a while
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:02:55
Not really, since new Bitcoins are mined every day and sold to whoever offers the most in an open free global market. As more people buy and the price goes up, those who sell will have more ROI and less Bitcoins.
In other words... (I think I could use some help here)  =)
Or can they??

I think you should get a couple of friends, get your recording device and upload to youtube! It might be a hit.
Then, at the end of the video and in the comments section, you add your Bitcoin address, and not ask for "Thumbs up", but for a small donation if they liked the video.
Im still wondering why is it that nobody is doing that yet in youtube...

Bitcoin? no! Hop in!
Minning? probably. you need super expensive HW to be profitable, and maybe a pool.
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:34:38

but again, I still cant figure out the swing thing. Maybe you know better?
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:55:44
It wont...
or does it?
well, at some point, you will have so many miners that the profits will decline; some will even loose money. Those miners will jump off the business and with fewer miners, profits will go a bit up.
in the long run, people will be making just enough money to stay in business, but not much.
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:53:37
When I was a little kid, I saw my father got REALLY upset when the government announced a major devaluation of the national currency. 
Having contract business signed in dollars, bankrupt not only the family business, but literally (and not virtually) most of the country economy. 
I didn´t quite get it a the time, but I´ll never forget my father that day.

I read the article, is cool. But I missed the part about Bitcoin  :S
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:03:58
hard to say, because although it is the first (and the one Im betting on), there is this other Coin which is "environmentally friendly". Using less resources to generate coins, and being faster than Bitcoin confirming transactions.
CryptoCoins are still babies, who knows which will become the bigger child.

Actually, Kraken has nowadays under 30 employees (according to wiki); I think they might be young and have understood the opportunity to create a webcoin friendly bank before the giants wake up (I guess they also had the connections, not only youth and vision).
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:24:31
Im not sure I agree on all. (a very interesting analysis, btw.)
2. It will not threaten any currency, since there are services to convert immediately BTC to Dollar (I guess to yuan too), so there is zero risk here.
3. Yes, they are banned and for good reasons. I Bitcoin fails, the whole economy fails. But, for private citizens to take the risk, if they fail, then it is their own fault.
6. I think that people in China will be "free" (whatever that means) at some point. It is a process. The US had slaves in the past. The europeans had their colonies...
Getting to a "perfect" world is a process, and China is well on the right path (I must add that Ive never been to China, so take this from an ignorant online). China has done a very good job catching with the West on technology (Space Program, Aviation, Automotive, etc); it is still behind, but just still. China has taken out +200-300 million people from poverty to middle class. That is more people than most countries have.
Give it time. I swear I have faith that China will make a good country out for itself.
Edit: Numbers are 2, 3 and 6 (instead of 1, 2 and 3) but reddit somehow changed the numbers all by itself.

I dont get why are getting vote down.
I was seriously reading every new comment, because the first question could have been mine...
so anyway, there I am, reading about code, updates, miners and miners striking refusing to use the new release, and suddenly Im laughing out of your comment.
Id vote you up  =)
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:21:00
ok, here I go again.
We are doing development in Germany, we buy supplies from everywhere, from Asia, the middle east, Europe and America. We are manufacturing in Mexico, Romania and China; we are selling all over the world. Our suppliers are thousands of companies from all over the place. Our customers are mainly european, americans and asian..
Now, I do not want to buy a beer with this money. I want the company to kick down its transactional costs. Imagine all the money that we move, and every time we have a currency change, the Banks take a bit.
And there is no monopole in this type of coin. The miners will be the companies involved. Even people outside could mine, but keep in mind that this eCoin would be used for electronic components and stuff.... not for pizzas...
So basically, we would mine by independent location, of all the people involved. In America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, opens source (a copy paste of Bitcoin if you will). The price will be set of course by demand and supply. 
If savings are indeed to be gain, more companies in the supply chain will participate.
etc. etc. etc.

what you have not get is that we work together all the time, for many projects. We move money from A to B and from B to A all the time. The idea of this eCoin is to save the cost of moving money through the financial institutions.

0) I think you should send us your article and ask for tips and ideas on how to improve it. Seems like you want reddit to do your HW. Anyway, a couple of tips...
1) transaction fee is close to zero.
2) non reversible
3) you buy in Bitcoins, regardless of the currency, so there are no cost of changing currency.

@_date: 2013-12-14 12:59:32
Im no expert. I think that to know the balance of an address, you need the whole chain, sort of to prove where its Bitcoin come from. Something along that line.
Bitcoins are mined into an address, and from there they go here and there. If you do not have the history, someone could fake/hack an address with 1million Bitcoins and sell them... 
Just a sec... some expert will comment soon  =)
