Thank you very much!

That is my current understanding, hence my question :)

Out of curiosity: why do you prefer Trezor over Ledger?

You can absolutely make it easier for people to be interested in certain things, though.

You can hold any number of different assets with the Nano S - you just need to have the right app installed whenever you want to interact with a certain chain.
@_date: 2019-03-10 16:15:13
This is correct. As long as your seed stays the same, you can install and uninstall apps at will without it having anything to do with your coins or wallets. So one Ledger Nano S can hold aaaaall the coins.

I appreciate your warning. But my message was more going at 'buying anything I want to play', not making more money off of it. Just going with the joke :)

I am with you in this.
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:23:37
I came to the same conclusions. But part of the feeling remains ;) 
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:56:57
I was too afraid of all the possible mistakes I could do during the process you described - so I bought a second one. I feel dumb but safe.

Oh, I was assuming that the phrase was known and 'only' the 25th word has to be cracked.
Thank you for your explanations, I did indeed sell it short and stand corrected.

Yeah, I feel this is overlooked way too often. The additional password (or 25th word) just adds inconvenience for the attacker, but no real security. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:31:11
I know - it should still be easy though, as long as people use bad passwords (as most still do). has a point though, the password can be long enough to actually do its job.

Preferably after you have moved the BTC. Otherwise you have another set of tools/websites to worry about.
