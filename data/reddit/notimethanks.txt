Strange. I think it looks worse now. They could easily move them a little close together to fit it. The fee warning at the bottom is what's crowding it up. :p

Electrum also has a "do not use change addresses" option, if they confuse you.  It's less anonymous, but easier to wrap your head around.

 for a very reasonable price.

I see plenty of $ clothing. I think people buy it for the general symbol of wealth though and not in support of the US dollar as a currency lol, but I do see your point.

It's only for receiving payments. You just bring up the receive page and the NFC/QR changes dynamically when/if you enter a request amount and/or label. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:10:41
If you use electrum you can turn change addresses off if you don't want to deal with them.

Apparently his roommates didn't even know his real name. They knew him as josh. I think his setup was intended to hide himself as much as possible.

Awesome! I would consider pulling more stuff from blockchain.Info. They have a bunch of neat stats in the api that would be useful. ex. Market cap, total btc in circulation, difficulty,latest transactins at a given address, and it would be nice to pull all the chart data they have. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:03:25
They do. Well the android bitcoin wallet does. Qr, NFC, and even offline Bluetooth transactions. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 05:27:55
I don't like you.

Not sure, but you should come next week same time and place.

I can't even imagine. That's awesome to have that happen and be able to suddenly give so much.
