I believe that depends on various things, but I think you can double spend by sending a transaction to 0.8 clients and re-spend the same bitcoins by sending the same bitcoins to yourself on the 0.7 chain. For the next hour(s) 0.8 clients will believe you paid them, but as soon as the 0.7 chain will be longest, you will get the bitcoins back again. EDIT: This would be very hard to pull off, but I'm pretty sure it is technical possible (definitely not easily, but possible)

... and is probably the strongest (well tested and analyzed) hash function we have.
Cryptographers spottet the (potential for a hidden) backdoor in Dual_EC_DRBG right off. SHA2 was first published 2001, and so far no one has found anything "suspicious".

And why would Satoshi "come back from the dead" after 3~4 years without a word, post a "fake" email, not sign his message(!!) and then disappear again without a word... that make no sense at all.
The person doing this is without doubt not an amatur, but Satoshi? Nah (we have no evidence and it doesn't make sense that he should suddenly post one not very important message and then disappear again).

You said the 0.7 fork would win, but the 0.8 had the most mining power ( = it was longest and would have been the longest if nothing was done) and at some point people would have to change to a newer bitcoind version (&gt;=0.8), so in the end the 0.8-fork would have won.

MD5 and SHA1,2,3 is all made to hash huge amount of data, so they are not suited for hashing passwords (i.e. they are too fast). What you can do is use something like pbkdf2 (**P**assword-**B**ased **K**ey **D**erivation **F**unction **2**) to hash the password over and over again (e.g.  *for(i=0;i&lt;10.000;i++){ hash = algo(hash.pass.salt) }*  ).
But just replacing md5 with sha3 will not solve anything, regarding password hashing.
@_date: 2013-05-28 15:17:23
A salt protect against attacking many password hashes at once (i.e. precomputed "rainbow table" because the salt will make each password unique, so you can't precompute a list of hashes and their plaintext), but does not protect against brute-forcing a single password, because all you need to do is add the salt to the "password guess".
To give an example:
I have a list of MD5 password hashes (without salts):
To brute-force this list, I will first make a "password guess" (what I think one of the passwords might be). I begin with the guess "password1", hash it (takes time and use "a lot" of computer power): 7c6a180b36896a0a8c02787eeafb0e4c and match it against my list (easy and does not use a lot of computer power). None of the hashes match my hash, so none of the passwords is "password1".
To see how many people that use the password "password1" on a list of 10M hashes, all I need to do is calculate the hash of "password1" once, and match it with list.
Now take the same list, but with salts (hash:salt):
I create my password guess: password1 then I append the first hash (r4&amp;bo!ph) and calculate the md5 of "password1r4&amp;bo!ph" (335d77555925020a80a69ac6e9dcb2c0) and match it against the first hash. Then I calculate the md5 of "password18iU=le*i" (d172499bf58e5f8e4f4438579fffb1d9) and match against the second hash, and then "password10O$stoa&amp;" (ae03590a3a104a8357e726885c9040a9) and match against the last hash.
So to attack a list of 10M password hashes, I would need to calculate the md5 hash of "password guess + unique salt" 10M times.
The salt protect against precomputing (rainbow tables) and attacking many hashes at once, but will not protect against brute-forcing a single hash.

There is no such thing as "free bitcoins", just like with "*real*" money ;-)
Some websites will show you ads/steal your mail/whatever, but thats usually not worth more than ~0.0001 BTC, so you will need to do a lot of "watching ads" before you can ever get 31 BTC (at the currently price of bitcoins vs dollars it will take you around one billion years).
(if you wanna get some free bitcoins, then take a look at this website:  , remember to uncheck "*Delay payment to minimize transaction fees*" if you want the bitcoins fast)

A powerfull quantum computer would break some(all?) asymmetric encryption algorithms, but symmetric (and hashing algorithms like SHA2) would still remain "safe" (they will however only be 'half as strong' for the quantum computer, e.g. 256 bit key would be as strong as a 128 bit key).
Also no, we probably wouldn't "change" SHA2 for SHA3, as SHA3 isn't (necessary) better than SHA2. (Do a search on why Keccak was chosen as SHA3). By the time quantum computers become a "danger" (which is far in the future), then we'll hopefully have better/stronger/faster hashing (and encryption) algorithms.
(edit: I am in no way a math/crypto-expert)

Faster block generation time = more orphaned blocks = longer (orphaned) blockchain forks = you would need more "confirms" (blocks) to trust a transaction.
So "faster block generation time" != "shorter confirmation times". You do not get the same level of security for one bitcoin confirm (10 min) and one litecoin "confirm" (2.5 min).
Also; more blocks = more bloat (you don't "feel" this in the bitcoin forks, simply because they are not as used as bitcoin).

I think some of your arguments are wrong. All modern browsers can view the active DOM, so checking the source (with AJAX modifications/etc) is easy. And anyone knowing how to check the source, would also know how to spoof their User-Agent, so bitzino wouldn't know when it's talking to an iPhone Safari user and when it's talking to me with a highly modified Firefox browser ;)
Also I think many of the attacks are more social engineering the user than actually exploiting a flaw in the design (and most of the "exploits" require that the user (or an addon in the browser) doesn't check the source/DOM while playing, which would already be a huge mistake).

Transaction fee protect the network of someone spamming it. Also, each time a miner chose to include a transaction, he will use time/cpu to process the transaction, and when he finds a block the risk of getting forked is higher if the block has many transactions in it.
So to compensate for this, you are recommended to pay a small fee. Some miners will choose to include transactions for free and some choose not to include any transactions at all. I believe the default behavior for bitcoind means that usually 0.0005 btc is enough to be "accepted".
When you create a transaction you select input and output addresses, the bitcoins left, e.g. input&gt;output, will automatic go to the miner ("the fee")

Faster block generation time = more orphaned blocks = longer (orphaned) blockchain forks = you would need more "confirms" (blocks) to trust a transaction.
So "faster block generation time" != "shorter confirmation times". You do not get the same level of security for one bitcoin confirm (10 min) and one litecoin "confirm" (2.5 min).
Please note that litecoin DOES confirm transactions faster than bitcoin (not 2.5 vs 10, but slightly faster), however litecoin is still WAY to slow for any "instant" POS system (just like bitcoin).
Also; more blocks = more bloat (you don't "feel" this in the bitcoin forks, simply because they are not as used as bitcoin).
Scaling in bitcoin is going to be hard, but scaling in litecoin is going to be even harder (e.g. it might end up killing litecoin, if litecoin ever become very popular).
The other major different between bitcoin and litecoin is "scrypt vs SHA256". IMO this was a bad choice from the litecoin developer. Bitcoin is protected by the mining power of ASICs, this means that someone wanting to do something bad (e.g. hacker with a botnet or NSA with supercomputer) can't do much against bitcoin, but litecoin is very vulnerable to any attacks from botnets/NSA. Also people investing in ASIC have economic incentive to just mine 24/7 (you can't really say the same thing about litecoin miners).
I believe litecoin isn't much more than a bitcoin fork for the people that "missed the boat" (first when GPU's took over mining and litecoin was branded as "CPU only", then when people wrote code to mine litecoins on GPU it was changed to "protect against the 'ohh' so dangerous ASICs").
IMO: Litecoin doesn't add anything new or exciting, it is only a (outdated) fork of bitcoin with a few changes to it.

You can't really simplify it like this. First, "breaking" something in cryptography just means "finding a faster solution". Anyone finding a flaw in SHA-256 will most likely not mean anything to bitcoin, as the 'difficulty' will just increase (which is bad for currently ASIC miners, but thats it).
Second, SHA-256 has proven to be a very strong algorithm. Just look at the reason why Keccak was chosen to the SHA3 winner (because SHA2 had no serious flaws, so we didn't need a new 'sha2'-ish algorithm just to replace the currently SHA2). Also listen to all the brainiacs at the RSA '13 conference - cryptography today is so strong, that all problems we see today is related to "side-channel attacks". Math is great, but it can't protect against the 'Rubber-hose'.
I'm not saying that we wont see a "major" attack against bitcoin (just like people tend to find a major flaw in SSL once a year), but IF anything ever happend, then I would be surprised if the bitcoin community wouldn't be able to fix it quickly.
Third, it is much more likely that someone will find a flaw in ECDSA. But most users are already protected, because Bitcoin-QT uses a new addresses for each transaction, so nobody know your public key for your stored/saved bitcoins.

The first argument of PBKDF2 is the PRF (hash function) you want to use, this could be SHA2 :-) And the standard was written in 2000, so it's older than SHA2 (and also very known, so don't worry about that).
Applying SHA2 several times will lose some entropy (this is why you should use PBKDF2 instead of just a "sha(sha(sha..))"-loop), but it will also be much slower, which we like when we need to store passwords.

Not only for privacy reasons. Like dbug said, a hash (of a hash) of a public key is much much harder to break than just the public key.

0.8 had the most mining power, but the 0.7 blockchain was accepted by both 0.7 and 0.8 clients/miners, so by downgrading to the 0.7 blockchain we will make sure that the blockchain will continue to be accepted by **all** clients and miners.

Well, if there was no pools, then we still couldn't know if most miners would use 0.7 or 0.8 :) But pools exist and pools has the majority of the hashing power, so in the end 0.8 would have won if nothing was done.
It would have been very, (very!), very bad for bitcoin, if all 0.7 clients was left behind (because 0.8 would have been the winner), but luckily the guys at  was fast and got most of the miners to downgrade to 0.7

You make it sound like bitcoin is "controlled" by a group of people (*"the developers"*), but really everyone can join  (freenode), everyone can submit patches to github, etc. Everyone can become an 'official' bitcoin developer.
However someone needs to control the "alert key" to bitcoind. Someone needs to check and accept the patches on github. And yes this is what a small group of people does (gavin+crew). Without them bitcoin wouldn't exist. Without them someone would submit patches to bitcoin which, in the end, would be the dead of bitcoin. "The developers" (gavin+crew) want the best for bitcoin, and know the most about bitcoin, so really we should be glad that they spend som much time making bitcoin even better.

Just to clear something up: my first "no" was not to "wrong conclusion" but to "0.7 would automatically win". Looking at  we can see that there is most 0.7 clients, but big mining pools only count as óne 0.8 client (even though one pool = many people).
I believe that most miners will always use the newest client (because "new = better, faster, etc"), so without mining pools we should see more 0.8 clients. Looking at the two forks, 0.8 was faster, so assuming 'no pools' would still mean that 0.8 was faster (and thus 'win'), this would mean that all shops/merchant using a custom 0.7-solution would be in risk of double spending, until a patch is developed (which hasn't happened yet) or that they upgrade to 0.8. This would be very, very, very bad for bitcoins reputation (think about all the "you can't trust &gt;6 confirms" post we would see then) and is very likely to happen:
