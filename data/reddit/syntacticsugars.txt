BTC :
* has the most history/processing power(thus more secure)
* has the most peer reviewed testing than any other system
* network effects. interacting with other institution that are already using btc is seamless.  compared to creating propitiatory chains.
we will definitely see private chains, but i predict they will be very short lived.

easy 
just run it over http. they only way to stop something is to kill the physical infrastructure.  which is a very unlikely scenario.
not to mention that banks are most likely going to end up doing settlements on btc's blockchain, and not a private chains.

ahh yes them capitalistic monopolies.  what the fuck? yeah you lost, you where fighting fire with fire. (centralized system vs centralized system) ofcourse they shut you down.  along with popcorntime/aruose/trackers/etc,  all still rely on a 3rd parties. once you remove the need, problem solved. 
*side note i dont remeber the last time i needed a tracker. DHT ftw
which lead to the fact that yeah HTTP is broke. finding data base on location is kinda dumb(for this day and age)  [ipfs]( and [cjdns]( are worth looking into.
also  severing html/javascrip via bittorent.
 theres plenty of work being done for making web 3.0

i think you misinterpreted.
its scalability. its hard to govern more things than less of them. but we have new ways of scaling, systems that theoretically could scale to all of humanity. 
this "singleton system"  is not a centralized structurer, but is a unified one.  
we don't drive for more entropy, we settle to equilibrium.  look over the past 10000 years of governance. less crazy, more people.

decentralized exchanges in a dao formate are in the works. it would reduce down to dealing with individuals. not perfect, but makes regulating muchmuhc harder and more expensive

no, its the darkest life

Explain darker net markets, or who satoshi is
@_date: 2016-11-30 06:15:37
well you dont know that.  the pub key that we know belongs to satoshi hasnt moved any funds for a long time. but i bet there are plently other keys satoshi owns we dont not know are his/hers/theirs. and no, venders ahve been caught form shit opsec not fiat exhange

would we call this possibly a point of increased centralization? whom ever runs the pool is calling the shots, not the miners them selves. the miners could "pull out" but theres economic incentives at play.
