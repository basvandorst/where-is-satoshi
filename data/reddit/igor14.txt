At the monent it's clear, that already there is a competition and it looks like it will be increasing. Till the end of this year positions of the main players most probably will remain unchainged, but it's difficult to predict the future.

A good one about regulators: "Given all the hoopla, it’s not so much of a surprise that regulators are finally stepping in."

Looks like till the end of the year we could see increase of technological and market competition of cryptocurrencies and some breakthroughs in the bitcoin and competitors technologies , which could affect bitcoin position at the market and it's exchange rate

Liking or disliking this comment won't influence this process and final winner at all)))  as in many other cases the technology, which has significant advantages has more chances to win. Technical progress could be artificially delayed, but could not be stopped at all))) It's impossible to predict now who will finally win from point of view of technology, but it looks like competition is already intense and I would assume, that dislikes of my initial comment above it's in a sense an evidence of this competition)

looks like it's a nice toy, but from protection and reliability points of view protection with long password and some shockresistant and waterproof housing could do the job better.)

it would be interesting to see who is pushing this post down. May be those who plan to issue some API tokens or other tokens which are not worth buying)

At the moment we see the process of bitcoin technical improvement and also a number of competitors who promise to provide significant technical advantages in comparison with bitcoin. Looks like finally one of the projects will be the winner or also possible, that several major cryptocurrencies will exist at the same time as it is now.

 0.79% of total wallets contain 89,28% of total coins, as a result bitcoin price depends very much on the activities of relatively small number of market participants. It looks like they could control bitcoin price and such situation increases risks of investing in Bitcoin.

As an alternative to buying a mining account one could consider participation in ICO.  But it's clear that it's very risky and make sense only in case if expected returns are very high and if all available measures are taken to reduce risks .  There are several ICOs of mining datacenters and it looks like it's a good idea and if it will be implemented properly and successfully,  it could work for the investors also. At the stage of ICO there are real risks that it could be a scam and also a risk, that people will do their best, but the project will fail due to some reasons. The risk could be reduced in case of investing into several carefully selected and analysed projects. In case of ICO it's important to pay special attention to what kind of tokens is offered during ICO and what kind of benefits token owners could get.

looks like splitting undermines one of fundamental initial ideas behind the bitcoin - the definite and limited number of available coins. In situation, when splitting is allowed and possible and happens from time to time we got infinite number of coins.

looks like it's too risky to keep coins in exchange wallet. why people are doing this? Isn't it safer to keep coins in own local wallet or better hardware wallet and transfer to the exchange only when it will be needed.

Looks like at the moment it is not clear yet if gold will be completely replaced by bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency or not, but if it will happen it will be great. Costs of keeping and transfering gold are quite high and shift from gold to cryptocurrency will help to reduce these costs significantly. looks like it's a great potencial in cryptocurrencies backed by gold. And even if a good solution for replacement of gold by cryptocurrency isn't  found we could expect, that in many cases cryptocurrencies backed by gold will be used instead of gold.

"This weekend's centralized Chinese miner attack on  has shown that ironically,  relatively low network capacity and, consequently, slow transaction speed serves well to protect its price against flash crashes. Most competent investors store large amounts of  in off-line cold storage wallets. To sell, they first need to transfer the  to an exchange via the  blockchain, which can only handle 7 transactions per second. Once the waive of selling starts, the bitcoin network gets immediately clogged with a large number of transfers (115,000 this weekend) and the transfers to exchanges take hours to confirm. Moreover, Chinese miners unwisely withdrew the hashpower from the  network this weekend, which slowed the transaction speed even more. That gave the market plenty of time to recover and prevented the planned crash. Once the rigged price and volume data from Bithumb was excluded from the Bitcoin Cash price index, BCH price fell to the actual lrvrls and the attack was over. On the other hand, most stocks are kept on exchanges and can be sold immediately." Pavel Pogodin posted on FB

" China has ordered a halt on all ICO financing, effective immediately. Moreover, token issuers who have completed ICOs are required to provide refunds to token buyers. Trading platforms have been restricted from providing price information and conducting any exchange between fiat and virtual currencies"
