Since when has unrealized capital gains been part of GDP?....
Capital gains has never been part of GDP. This is all nonsense. GDP is ‘production’. If investments factored into it you really think the US would’ve only seen 3% growth this year?

Well I didn't buy any for investment purposes but I'd gamble the vast majority of bitcoin was purchased because people were hoping to make money off of it.

Tell that to all the people who bought bitcoin and lost money. I know more who lost money than made money off of it.

No I don't own any bitcoin whatsoever. I never invested in it.

Yeah, no one can really predict that bitcoin will hit 100k. Anyone who does is an idiot.

Wouldn’t make sense. You’d be better off mining Monero since it’s CPU intensive and JavaScript can’t leverage your GPU for mining.
It’s why tons of sites have JavaScript monero miners and none have bitcoin.

From what I’ve heard a ton of sellers get defrauded since eBay typically sides with the consumer.

As soon as I looked at that painting I assumed the data was in those flames. It’s still got a few more levels of difficulty to it past that though.

I thought they owned PayPal?

Not me, I don't think there''s enough on there to be worth the time. But if someone from a poorer country sees it they could get a few days wages potentially from decoding it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:28:37
Seriously. Or someone will spend 5 minutes figuring out how to decode that.
