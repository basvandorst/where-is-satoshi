An ugly article written by spoilt man child.  
I personally wish Jon Matonis would never speak another word about bitcoin again, he comes across as an arrogant condescending bitocin fanboy.

Spoken like an ignorant idiot or a shill - pick one.

BFL are yet to be an ASIC vendor, their main product they currently sell is BullShit.  
They are definitely not cheap if you consider the price of bitcoins 8 months ago when orders were placed compared to now.
Avalon is not the only ASIC manufacturer, ASICMiner will be releasing usb stick miners soon, ideal entry point for everyone :)

I nearly ordered 10x of their singles, thank god I took my time to research it.  Things for me started stinking when I realised they were massively behind on filing pre-orders 6-8 months old and were still advertising it as a finished product that would be delivered in 2-6 weeks.
The same trick they pulled for their ASIC's.
Then I found out Sonny Veilsides is on parole for ~$20 million dollars worth of fraud from a mail order scam he perpetrated on senior citizens. I could not run in the opposite direction fast enough.

spoken like a butt hurt greedy "Im gonna get rich quick" bitcoin investor.

bitinstant has been accused of using new orders to pay for old orders for nearly a month now.
Its most likely a ponzi scheme at this point, if new funds stop coming in orders will stop being filled.

sure if you feel like loaning BFL your bitcoins for ~8-14 months and then getting a product that doesnt meet the specifications they sold you.
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:09:12
Honestly I think we will be lucky to see it hold $100, $50 is a much more realistic price.

They are following the BFL model:
1) Sell working product.  
2) attempt to build working product.  
3) excuses......

he will ride high until he makes that 1 bad trade he can never recover from.  
I wont laugh at him but I may put a few bitcents in his begging bowl :D

lol yer no such thing as free speech - better make a bet to back up your every claim lol. &lt;/s&gt;
Silly child.

BFL dubstep ?
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:31:38
Im not worried about ROI but network security.
Given power consumption can be written off for anyone that leaves their PC on, I think the usb asic's are ideal.
Bitcoin is not a "get rich quick scheme" despite the way BFL marketed their ~~scam~~ products.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:31:53
Pretty much.  
Honestly 2 douches like that having large amounts of bitcoin is enough to put me off the idea all together.
PPC here I come !!!

Between unknowns, Id be happy with 1 confirmation myself.

yes they are,  there was even trading done while they were supposedly offline.

I didnt claim that he is, but he is a convicted conman and a poor excuse for a human being.  For him to be involved at any level rings alarm bells, the previous con he was involved in was also a family affair.
Right up until some very pointed questions were asked, Sonny was acting as CEO for BFL.  
If you wish to trust a convicted con man who is selling you an unfinished product as finished then by all means, throw good money after bad.


Yes they are.
* They have continued to advertise incomplete/ nonexistent products as complete and ready for order.   
* They have blatantly lied about shipping times for over 1 year, purposefully leading clients to believe the products were built and ready to be shipped not "still testing and failing to meet advertised specs ie power consumption".  
I could go on.....

You mean you cant just spout your uninformed opinions while presenting yourself as an authority on the  topic ?
