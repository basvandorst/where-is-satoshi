what sparked the change?

You could use tor or a similar scheme to pass that burden on. Otherwise I think most hotspots today have different means of signing up and paying. If we could get those 10 minutes automated or at least down to a couple of seconds they would be useful for not just stranded tourists.

you would probably be more interested in stacking low fees on top of each other to get speedier inclusion

you pay a bitclouder to deliver your packets to the internet. this bitclouder has an internet subscription. you can deliver your packets to the bitclouder with wifi or bluetooth for example. this does not have to be one hop.

Mediagoblin requires an ISP.
_As far as I understand_ bitcloud is more low-level. They want people to be able to sell bandwidth on the Transport layer (after the OSI model). That would be awesome.
edit: not sure if transport layer is the right one

The other miners could stop sending the blocks they find to ghash

0.8% fee compared to 1.35% on kapiton.se

I think you just put the harlem shake script down

I think systems like cjdns solves some of that. [projectmeshnet.org](
@_date: 2013-07-08 11:49:47
Maybe [appfog.com]( or [dotcloud.com]( would be cheaper than heroku

I just hope it wont be full of enthusiastic western shop-owners or a monologue bitcoin 101. I'm more interested in particularities and edge-cases.

I think I would be interested in seeing a logarithmic version of the bitcoin trading volume by currency chart, if it's even possible.

they should have went for btcb.uy instead imo :)

If I get the gist of your post I think we would both like a solution where you could stack fees on top of each other, for pending transactions. Very much like how I believe you can add together small transactions today to finally make a multiple send transaction. Something that was intended to help micro transactions.
This would produce a good market balance where people with time can push the price down.

I'd really love to get all my change in bitcoins. Even if I would pay with fiat. Imagine to be completely free of all those worthless metal coins.

No, because computing operations are not stored in arrays with a length of 8, which however the data storage form bits are, making up a Byte afaik

I think what people mean with a centralized government is rather a hierarchical government where the lower ranks doesn't have any power. (isn't centralization the whole idea of governments?) I agree with lf11, that in the context of every (currently existing) financial system bitcoin is destabilizing, or at least a factor of uncertainty. In a high and far ruling position, with little insight into the scenario that could unfold banning is in favor.

You could also tether your way to p2p heaven

But loan interest and usd inflation have historically been lower than bitcoin's value increase even if combined, right?
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:38:16
There is a [dmca page](
Actually there has been a seemingly similar situation to this before related to solidcoin. I don't know what came out of it though.

Perfect candidate for a javascript library imo. Generating it automatically from address on canvas.
@_date: 2013-08-07 12:14:23
Some ideas:
* Increase bet and counter-bet during game
* Keyboard controls. 1, 2, 3, 4 for towers, shift for multiple placements and space for send creeps. These are standard controls to my experience.
* See tower attack radius during placement
* Make tower red (or something) when trying to place on prohibited ground

It works for me on chrome 27 and firefox 21, running windows 8. Maybe try another or newer browser, or just download the video instead.

perhaps gpu miners might sell their devices and put some of the return in bitcoins
@_date: 2013-05-22 11:22:36
There is also much cryptography going on in the system. Client side I believe.
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:52:10
A better fitting question would be how many [getworks]( it can serve for pool miners to hash away on
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:31:21
I found some typos




I would also advice against using 'id="ad1"', my (not very heavy) adblocking removed it.

The fees are 3% and 1% for btcguild and bitminter respectively.
Distribution at last top (2013-05-10 17:30:32):
btcguild 14.40 THs, now at 11.11
bitminter 6.53 THs, now at 6.32
Good call migrating from btcguild first, if so!

it does for the track but not the edge of map, so maybe not a problem.

Mike Hearn has talked some on how you could make a decentralized exchange system together with ripple by using its lending capabilities. The application/deal algorithm performs a huge graph exploration to settle a deal and (probably) multiple loans. Somewhat of a hastle to use perhaps, but it should work, and very resiliently. 
It's also explained in the wiki:

It would be cool to sell bandwidth with bitcoins in this manner. In the future, that is.

btcnCNY closing in on mtgoxEUR on 30 day volume. Notice the almost double 24 hour volume.
