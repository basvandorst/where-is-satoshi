How were they able to use your fingerprint / passcode to confirm the purchase / payment?

There's no docket number, so I have no idea.

What a brilliant idea... bring up the youth the right way!

It might just be they are hitting their limits

Oh my god, hahah love it!

100% use Cash App. 
Nearly instant, allows withdrawals at 0.001
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:40:34
If you are looking for a software wallet many people recommend Electrum.
I use Exodus and a Ledger Nano S(hardware wallet) as my main wallets.
@_date: 2019-03-21 13:51:10
CashApp if you are already verified.

Wow, My brain is confused by this photo.
@_date: 2019-03-26 16:50:47
I've only heard bad things about it.
@_date: 2019-03-26 11:51:33
Care to give some more information on [Blockchain.com](

Why was she standing still?
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:14:58
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:49:52
Ok, now that seems nuts. I've never had that issue.
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:57:05
I believe you have to create a new wallet unfortunately. Select legacy when creating the wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:58:59
These can be bought for $1 on Aliexpress. I hope they purchased decent ones to give out.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:02:55
 
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:47:28
You need to use a legacy address in Electrum to be able to withdraw from CashApp.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:41:06
Yeah, I think it defaults to segwit, just select legacy when creating the new one and it will work!
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:28:11
haha, right? lol!
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:02:14
They are probably hitting people who post in crypto subs
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:22:00
Ever heard of the $5 wrench attack? If I beat you senseless I can get your seed. - This is the main opponent to memorization.

Done. I figured people here wouldn't be stupid enough to sign up. - Guess I was wrong.
Edit: I'm not going to bitch.

User sends btc to bch address - Fail
User then loses access to the only verifiable part of his account - his email. - Fail
User expects Shapeshift to give information to another email address and change their security policy. - Fail
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:49:51
Right? Sign me up!

Now this is how you teach security.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:02:47
Sorry for my tone haha, 
I'm an ass sometimes when I react to things. It's all good man.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:42:36
haha, right? I wish you the moon! :P
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:39:06
Setup an electrum wallet with legacy addresses.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:34:44
I guess if you had an exchange ready to go that domain would end up paying for itself.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:40:05
No problem, it's an option when you create the wallet. You probably selected segwit
@_date: 2019-04-29 17:13:15
Run from Bitpay.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:32:38
100% legit obviously!

The "Proof of concept" for this has already been shown. Amateur Radio (Hams) users have sent crypto over radio waves. They are also technically able to send pictures, tv, and other data.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:54:42
Memorized keys cannot be detected, correct. BUT, they can be beaten out of you.
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:17:22
By designed, do you mean took from Sega? lol Just messin.
They look sweet.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:31:31
This was my first time getting it, knew immediately it was garbage but figured I would share it so people know it's going around.
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:14:00
Never enter your seed words anywhere unless you are restoring an account. Never. Ever.
Your money is gone and there's nothing you can  do now unfortunately. Please research Bitcoin more before getting back into it.
@_date: 2019-04-19 12:47:40
I do not have any resources but I remember people mentioning the chance of the same private key being generated twice is damn low. I think so low that it's a non-issue. I could be wrong though...
@_date: 2019-04-18 18:24:43
Love the teletype feel!!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:09:28
Did it have the seal over the device itself?
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:30:08
BitPay. Meh
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:38:13
I apologize, my explanation was weak and swapped words and understanding several times. I was simply trying to give a general overview for someone who knew nothing.
Obviously, I have much more to learn.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:12:23
I wasn't the "name" it was the type of paper written.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:23:57
Use a different wallet software. The 24 words can be entered into any wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:38:21
I did something similar, mine says HODL and then has the BTC symbol
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:49:07
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:47:25
100% scam and it has nothing to do with anything you have done recently other than getting interested in BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:49:26
There are only 2048 words on the list.

@_date: 2019-05-14 13:50:55
when you got the app again did you use your restore seed?
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:02:31
As an amateur radio ham the idea of transferring BTC transactions via radio is fascinating. Hams transfer data all the time over the bands so this isn't far from becoming a new hobby for hams.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:49:43
plus that last word acts as a checksum right?
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:00:33
As a general suggestion, people do not recommend giving out your public addresses. While this technically doesn't leave you open to any attacks it provides a target. People can look up your address and find out how much is in it to determine if you are a target or not.
Don't tell people how much you have, don't tell people you even have any if possible.
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:23:19
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:24:24
OK, I apologize. I went way too deep for your current knowledge. Look into Deterministic wallets and how they work.
There's a private key from which all of your public keys are generated. It's a must to completely protect the private key, and it's recommended to protect your public keys.
Don't give your public addresses out to anyone, unless you are being given BTC by them.
You HAVE to provide your public address to receive funds, it's just not recommended to spout them all over the internet as the balance of any address and easily and quickly be looked up.
