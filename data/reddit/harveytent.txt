it really comes down to the journal, if its real then he pretty much deserves what he gets for being that stupid, if its fake then it was the perfect way to not only prosecute him but make him look like your traditional drug dealer scum bag. I think really it all comes down to the journal. I'm sure its what got his prosecuted.

it was happening sadly. The forum made it very clear. There were unexperienced teens getting shooting advice and even bragging about all the heroin they were doing. I don't know how widespread it was but there was a huge heroin thread that you could look at and see. There were crack and meth threads too which I assume had the same stuff going on. teens are more likely to be vocal on forums I think so with out some kind of info from the site its hard to know how bad it was. I've always been quite prodrugs but I do believe silkroad may have ruined some lives by giving antisocial people the ability to get any drug they could imagine. it made me rethink the drug issue a bit I think. Now I think that hard drugs are just too powerfully addictive and until we have a better option for treatment of addicts atleast that we should keep trying to keep them away from people. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:24:54
I'm amazed the silkroad didn't receive more attention. It was literally an example of what happens when drugs are legalized. The government should have put some money into studying it before shutting it down. Governments have no way to study the effects of drug legalization, silkroad was the perfect opportunity for them to do so. The owner of silkroad should have made certain statistics open for scientific purposes. So much could have been learned from that place. The way people react when given the availability to any drug is really something that should have been studied. The forums were interesting but it seemed like mostly the younger people used it. I'm not sure if that was a fair representation of the silkroad users. Seeing teenagers getting hooked on heroin was quite sickening, I wonder how often that occurred and if it would have happened without silk road. Would love to know what percentage of people slowly moved to heavier drugs as they because more comfortable with the site.

the thing people forget is bitcoin isn't just in America. The best thing bitcoin has going for it is its world wide. Its free western union with no limits. The American side seems inflated currently just because America has been the hotbed for technology for so long. This is proven technology that will be most usefull outside of America. so America can do whatever they want. The rest of the world will not do what the IRS tells them. How the hell is the IRS even going to know how many bitcoins you own. are you going to tell them? Think about Doge with charity. I don't donate to charities in general because they spend more on fundraising then on helping people. If I could use bitcoin to get the money directly to the people that need it then I would. Funnily bitcoin will become a way for many people in the world to avoid America, no longer having to deal with American banks or special interests. we can go around them with bitcoin. American cant buy and sell this currency to control it like it does so many others.

he wont be extradited for civil suits. Has to be criminal. Best bet would be to work with getting him charged. Either for money laundering from before MTgox demanded ID or for the theft of the money. Otherwise he isn't going anywhere. he can claim he wont come to America because if he does he could be arrested for money laundering which is true. Mt Gox certainly used to be used to launder money from silkroad. you used to be able to access it through tor and needed no ID or anything to use it.

I imagine the system matches the current highest bid to current lowest offer when ever possible. When their is a difference in those numbers one would have to be chosen. It doesn't seem that odd to me that the offer price is chosen over the bid price, I would imagine who ever had the highest bid price at the time got a good deal.

Bitcoin used to be about anonymity. when that changed then everything changed. When gox started demanding ID's from traders that was pretty much the end. Up until then the only exchanges that asked for ID died shortly after. The nerve of an exchange asking for ID for bitcoin was huge but once gox started doing it then it became acceptable and once bitcoin became about just being internet money instead of being anonymous money then it became mainstream and now we are essentially just waiting for the governements to declare bitcoin illegal so it can go back to being anonymous again because once its illegal then no one will ask for id again and it will revert back to what it was. it wont die it will just revert. Gox really controlled bitcoin for a long time and had the power to steer it where they wanted too. And as we can see now gox was not the kind of place that should have had that much power. we put the power in the wrong persons hand and are now reaping the rewards. Hopefully the next person to wield that kind of power over bitcoin will be a better person. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:29:24
Banks talking trash about bitcoin but not mentioning the fact cash is printed randomly and has no real use. It's almost like they are bias. I think one of the major issues with bitcoin going forward will be banks. They make a lot of money from wire transfers and exchange fees and interest and will have the most reason next to governements to go against bitcoin and I think are more liklely to be listened to by its customers then citizens listening to governents. I think the problem is people have money in banks so are inclined to listen when they say something. A government saying something isn't a big deal, they say so much junk no one pays any attention.  This made me realize we need a bitcoin lender. We have exchanges that could double as banks but we have no bitcoin lenders. Bitcoin loans are a market we have no one going after. We will need that to happen at some point. Most fiat is totally based on loans so we need bitcoin loans to be legit. We need say some people living in big cities to start up bitcoin loan services. Imagine people getting mortgages in bitcoins. that would really be something.

he could easily be arrested for money laundering in America. Gox used to be anonymous, you didn't need id and could access it through tor. He could be charged for that time period. I doubt he will ever step foot in America again. It would be far too risky.

I posted "accepting bitcoin" sign at the apartment building I work at over the weekend. Came in on Monday and sure enough some guy is there lecturing one of my employees how bitcoins went bankrupt. I told him bitcoins are not what you think they are clearly, but he was adamant that they just went bankrupt. I was thinking the other day with the Mt Gox thing that no publicity is bad publicity which I'm not sure is right or wrong in this case. the guy saying bitcoin went bankrupt wouldn't have heard of them if not for gox but he thought they were bankrupt so not exactly a good impression of them. either way you can now rent a place to live with bitcoins in my town. Got that going for them. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:46:57
so long as they don't push laws regarding it then they can allow each agency to deal with it how they want. It's ideal for them. ideally people would force the government to legislate exactly what It is and how it should be treated but the government is better off leaving it in a gray area and we risk a lot by forcing the government to legistlate exactly what it is since if they issue bad laws against it that would be bad for everyone so it will stay in the gray zone until enough law makers are mobilized to do something one way or another.

obviously it would have to be a one off thing. Fork the chain and kill the large government wallets. A proof of stake vote of somekind could be held. people prove how many bitcoins they have and then can vote in favor or not of killing the wallets. Bitcoins are not money, I don't see a problem with taking advantage of that. it would be best for everyone if those coins were just deleted. Its not like that's a common thing to say. We all know whos coins those were, I think its a fair assumption he would want those coins deleted. perhaps he could be asked. if those coins had no value it would help DPR's legal battle as he could claim they never had value and thus he never sold anything.

to me its good news. to others its bad. Some people want it to be a proper currency and others like me would rather it not be. I think long term bitcoin users probably would prefer the government stay as far away as possible from it and news like this is great. Other people seem to think bitcoin will become some kind of official currency and think it will make them super rich and anytime its not referred to as a proper currency they get pissed. noncentralized and nonregulated is good with me though. So yay texas. Hopefully bitcoin people will start pushing lawsuits through the government of texas to get them to officialy state its not a currency, if we have a chance at overturning the IRS ruling on bitcoins texas is probably the place.

If I posted bitcoins for sale for $600, would they not sell for $600? Surely if someone accidentally lists their bitcoins for a low amount they would sell for that amount? I wouldn't imagine the system would say ok you are only asking for 600 but heres 700. Correct me if I'm wrong but when ever selling bitcoins I'm certainly very carefull about what price I put in, if this isn't the case then it wouldn't matter you would never get less then current highest bids. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:18:09
bitcoin went to hell when it stopped being anonymous. when exchanges turned tail and started demanding ID. The exchanges failed us. They were too greedy and didn't want to risk getting into trouble with America. It has wrecked bitcoin as a currency. Why use bitcoin to buy stuff if you have no anonymity, its already hard enough to buy and you have to pay enough fees but to lose anonymity was the end. we were willing to pay to have anonymity but with out it why pay the transferr fees and exchange fees to just buy stuff you can but with fiat.

If the bitcoins volume is about to overtake paypal then I guess money laundering is more likely to become a bigger part and all I can say to that is "BRING ON YOUR SWEET SWEET FAILED DRUG WAR MONIES!", like I give a damn what type of currency the drug lords use, might as well be bitcoin. Not like they didn't sell drugs before bitcoin. Some of you may not like what I say but does it really matter if bitcoins are used for laundering. The more money invested in bitcoins the harder it is for any single country or agency to damage it. Money buys influence, even drug lords have politicians in their pockets. The more money in bitcoin the more protection will come along with it. When the CIA starts funding secret ops in bitcoin we will have it made. We just need to have a high enough volume and cash out abilities that they can use.

bitcoins are still pretty anonymous. the exchanges are the problem. We used to buy bitcoins anonymously once upon a time. Currently bitcoins are mostly a first world thing which is why exchanges get stricter and stricter. Bitcoins could return to the shadows again one day, or just in certain countries were there are no real regulations. Volume has been one of the main issues, there just was not enough to do any major fund transfers. buying coins to transferr huge sums would hugely effect the market. Once the volume gets high enough then large sums can move around and we can see new uses for bitcoins for high value transations. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:30:18
you have to look at time and cost. How long did it take you to transferr the money, how much was the transferr, then the transaction fees. Bitcoin has a long way to go. Its stuck in a shitty place right now where it doesn't know how official it wants to be. all the exchanges are trying so hard to protect themselves that it takes days for verifications and transfers, it just doesn't make much sense. I feel like some people especially the large investors want to take bitcoin mainstream while the user base would rather stay as anonymous as possible. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:17:52
the only issue is why would you get a popup asking you to turn off 2FA. That screen shot does not say anything about needing to turn off 2FA to log on. If you got the popup telling you you had to turn it off before you could access your funds then they are in the wrong but I just can't see them having a system set up that would tell people to turn it off. Perhaps its what someone else mentioned that you were on a fake phishing site. Without proof of the popup they will probably just say you turned it off its your fault which is the case really. You should have questioned them telling you to turn it off after making such a big deal about having it in the first place. When it comes to the English being bad its clearly a mulitlanguage site so they can't really be blamed for a few typos. If the English was such a big deal you should have pulled your funds the first change you could which would have prevented this in the first place. You actually claim to have logged on on the first before whomever stole the funds. if you have activated 2fa again then this wouldn't have happened, if you had pulled your funds this wouldn't have happened. there was a lot of badluck for this to occur so I just can't blame the site, especially without proof they made you turn it off.

You can register a numbered company for very cheap 100% online. then you can take the documents to the bank and get a company account. this way if the bank turns on you there is no reason it should effect your personal account. you can then just open a new company or just take your companies business to a new bank. you should be able to register a company for 100 bucks or so totally online.

and how many large bitcoin thefts have there been? and how many have been recovered? Not anonymous you say? Name a drug seller who was caught due to bitcoin tracking. Bitcoin was designed to be as anonymous as possible while still being secure. if blocks didn't need to be compared to each other to prevent fake transactions then they wouldn't be. the creator of bitcoin was anonymous for gods sake, he used encryption where possible signing with pgp. Just because you can track a transaction to a wallet is meaningless. the creators never intended for bitcoin to be traded on exchanges that demand ID from everyone. the exchanges are the only thing that removed anonymity from bitcoin and its still very anonymous as proven by lack of anyone ever getting arrested for bitcoin theft no matter how large and bitcoins still being used for illegal activities. The future of bitcoin could easily go back to being fully anonymous. if bitcoins are heavily regulated or made illegal you think it will just die or it will go back to the shadows where it started? The exchanges are only taking id's because of liberty reserve getting busted and they are scared of laundering charges. The more money you make the less you want to be trapped to anonymity so exchanges got greedy and wanted to make legit money so forced bitcoin to go legit. Bitcoin has 2 things going for it. anonymity and nearly free world wide transfers but with transfers now taking a long ass time its not even that ideal for fast transfers anymore. you think retailers are going to love bitcoin when it could lose 10% of its value before they can cash it in. anonymity could easily end up back as bitcoins main asset. if price increases high enough it could become more and more ideal for laundering.

the worst thing that ever happened to bitcoin in my opinion is its value increasing so much. So many people now see it as purely an investment. If the value had been stable since inception at say 1 dollar or something then bitcoin could have grown as a currency instead of primarily as an investment option. Bitcoin needs to stabalize and drop its value as in investment and increase its value as a currency/transferr system.

well I don't see those being very popular. Who the hell is paying for those things, they will maybe get used the first day and then no one will touch them. The only way for bitcoins to take off as actual currency is for them to not count as currency but as an object. Then you are just buying something you can trade for something else. by trying to accept it as a currency and make ATM's they are screwing the pooch. They should be selling bitcoin giftcards. Say one card is .1btc and sell them at market price out of the machine. we should be trying to fight anyone that says its a currency. it's future does not lay in the heavily regulated currency market.

If you think Satoshi wanted to be treated like some founding father who people think could see the future you are nuts. The whole world is held back by outdated crap like the bible/constitution/governement agencies. Bitcoin was supposed to evolve and he didnt know where it would go so I'm sure he's happy that there is public involvement and would preferr we not take his words as from god.

article says the business paid for it. Clearly this is just viral advertising for the start up he talks about. Then again free pizza is the best pizza.

How many people will get stuck with a voucher they can't use because they don't have the docs needed to buy bitcoin at the atm's and figured they could just go turn it in for bitcoin no questions asked. Anyone that happens to will be turned off bitcoin for life after being forced to wait for an account to buy and cash out the coins.

I wish I had read this before I deposited money. unreal you can deposit and trade but not withdraw. I feel like i'm screwed now. I cant imagine why they would still be allowed deposits and not withdrawls unless they are scamming.

sounds more like going out of business so selling all their customers info, real comforting.

yea i got my money eventually. I think they may have rushed to reopen and gone alittle fast but they seem to have caught up now. Now their twitter/facebook is upto date and everything i think they are good to go. Kind of my fault for jumping in to trade as soon as i saw trades posted instead of waiting a day for things to get settled.

The more I think about it the more I believe that Obama honestly thought he had somehow fixed the middle east and his Arab Spring was going to fix everything. When the Arab Spring hit Syria and failed hes just been bitter ever since. The only reason i can see for them pushing so hard still for Assad to go even though it would certainly result in Daesh taking the entire country is revenge. When everyone voted for him they assumed he wouldnt be driven by revenge but here we are.

as i prepared to very easily prove who I am I decided that I am not strong enough but am strong enough to do press interviews, hire PR firms and pressure others into believing my lies. 
makes a ton of sense that moving some coins is the hardest part right

ah that  makes sense, he just can't lift them high enough to slide them into his wallet. It is all clear now.
