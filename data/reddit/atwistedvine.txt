Idk why reading this made me so happy. I guess it’s just nice to see a regular person become a millionaire without knowing it!  (Also I didn’t know people still played Eve ��)

It’s not a stupid question!  You can only lose up to the amount you put in. Think of it like a slot machine in that sense.  (That is just an anology, and many will argue not to think of Bitcoin this way.  It just seemed an easy way to explain.) 
Even through corrections or crashes, Bitcoin will always have value as long as someone out there finds value in it. Just like paper money.

I’m LOLing

So if all goes according to their plan... there won’t be any real negative effect on BTC holders?

[Spam Email Example](
I don’t see that one specifically, but I noticed lately I’ve gotten a lot of bitcoin spam suddenly. I only have a Coinbase account, and signed up two weeks ago.  I (naively?) believed it was just because bitcoin is all over the news lately.

I can’t pay attention to tv because I’m just staring at that wall. ��

There is definitely a dip atm, and no one is sure what tomorrow will bring. If it makes you feel better about buying, you could do $50 today and then $50 tomorrow evening once we see what futures will do to the price.  (Yes, you will pay more in fees doing two transactions.)
Just a thought. Definitely research, but as far as price, no one knows what will happen.

I think it’s a smart move.  Removed that ball and chain, and now you’re free!  I hope I’m there some day as well.

What do you think could be the fallout from the Tether fraud (if it is fraud at all)?
Sorry if this has been asked a hundred times/is ignorant.

I have also failed at hodling. Now I have a baby bit of bitcoin left, but determined to hodl ;)

So if there is a huge wall on the right/red side for example, it means a huge amount of bitcoin is for sale at that price?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:59:28
You don’t have to transfer first on Coinbase. You can buy directly with your bank account, and it will lock in the price you bought at.  It takes 7-10 days to clear, but your buy in price doesn’t change.

Silly question, probably. I’ve seen a lot of speculation on big money buying in to Bitcoin so they can short it when futures unroll. 
Assuming we can see the amount of BTC in wallets, has anyone pointed out where some new wallet suddenly has a huge amount of coin?  Like wallets that went from 0 to 100 etc recently?  (Maybe this isn’t possible or maybe this happens all the time anyway so it wouldn’t stand out. I’m just curious!) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:09
I feel like that’s true 90% of time. Market follows BTC.

Here’s a pretty good explanation:
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:47:33
I don’t believe it matters, you’re not bound to the pair you buy with. (Disclaimer I could be 100% wrong.)  I personally moved over ETH I already had to binance, but also because I didn’t wanna move my btc anywhere yet.

Just need to share. 
My dad keeps seeing BTC on the news and is very excited about it.  I was trying to discuss with my dad Bitcoin’s current fees, and how everyone is excited for Lightning network coming.  He keeps cutting me off and telling me that with BTC coming to some ETFs (exchange traded funds) you won’t have to pay these fees. 
I’m like Dad, nah, that’s different. Those ETFs aren’t moving BTC around, they’re like the futures. Bitcoin is on a Blockchain etc. He just kept shutting me down and told me to “look it up.” LOOOL Can anyone else share their frustrating experiences talking to fam about crypto? :(

This. I was waffling and was like, shit. I’ve spent more money on a slot machine.
