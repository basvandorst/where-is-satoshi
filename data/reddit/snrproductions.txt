Figured I'd chime in here.  I run SNR Productions, Inc.  I believe we were the first major cam site to adopt Bitcoins on   After some time (and a successful trial run on ClassyCams) I decided to also add them to  and   We wont be removing them any time soon.  I'm a big advocate of crypto currencies.  I even mine Litecoin as a hobby now :)

I fixed the link, thank you.  I typed it on a plane and I needed a nap haha.
Glad it worked out for you...sort of.  Some of the models are cheaper than others.

If you don't mind, will you email me at steve and tell me your IP address?  I want to find out why it's doing that...especially if you've never visited the site before.

No.  Once the credits are purchased there is no going back.  At least not at this time.

If Bitcoins work out as a payment method, we will be adding it as a payment option on    and  as well.  Keep in mind, if you deposit at  you can use your credits on any site listed above.  So far we are pleased with the response in the short amount of time it has been on the site.  It has brought quite a few new customers who wouldn't normally have been paying customers.

I use chase and buy/sell Bitcoins through coinbase without any problems.
