Thanks again for this, it seems I'm in a catch 22. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but, I was under the impression that a wallet is just the 'doorway' to my coins on the Blockchain - so I could delete the app and my Bitcoins will still be on secure, then I use my seed to 'access' them once a known Core wallet is available?

Thanks for all the insight. Taking the above into consideration, which would then be the best picks for a Core node iOS wallet for those of us who are fairly new and hodling? 
Or are their verified Core nodes we can tether to?

Phenomenal, thanks again for the willingness to share knowledge. Another question: if the best way to secure BTC is running a Core node and using the built-in wallet, why all the fuss over hardware wallets?

Phenomenal. That's great to hear and thank for the feedback! So, theoretically, you could run any number of different wallets with the same seed on the same device?

Hi, you may or may not have already addressed this - I'm fairly new to crypto. Could you tell me whether the GreenAddress wallet for iOS will be following the Bitcoin Core chain post Nov S2X fork? Would like to move my BTC from Bread to GA. Thanks for your input.

Thanks Bruno, that would be a great help. Thinking that running my own Core node is the only option now - it's a bit daunting to think this is the type of barriers to entry noobs should have to jump through, although, it has been a fantastic leaning curve and I've picked up great skills in the interim. How do you propose I go from here?

Thanks so much, man. Just so I understand correctly, what you're saying is, regardless of what client (Breadwallet, paper wallet, Trezor etc.) I'm using to access the Blockchain as long as I'm not transacting (only HODLING) there will be no possibility of losing coins or 'following' the S2X chain?

Thanks for all the feedback. I literally just became a hodler a few weeks back and as such my technical knowledge is lacking in many aspects. Would you be willing to help me get up and running as well as making the process known to the greater community of newish users?

I would recommend Coinbase first, if not, try Coinmama (though you will approx. 10% in fees) and get it off of the exchange as fast as possible - this means you need to get a good storage device for your Private Key (Seed) which, ultimately, is your access to the Bitcoin. 
Get a Ledger Nano S (it comes highly recommended and I just ordered one) then send your Bitcoin from Coinbase/Mama to the Nano S and let it sit there - it will be safe and you have the added bonus of getting coins from future forks. 
Do some research into the above and always try the process with a small amount first. If you make any mistakes it's only a small price to pay.

TIA = Thanks in Advance.

Would you be able to post a step-by-step guide on setting up your Core node as well as securing your BTC? I've heard the Core node client should only be downloaded via Tor?
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:12:38
If they add support for it then, yes, you have the option to access forked coins.

Wow, this keeps getting more complicated the deeper I dig. Thanks for the input, though. Say I download and install a BTC client from Bitcoin Core - how would I use the 'pruning' function?
