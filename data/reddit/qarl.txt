heh... ok, let me spell it out for you.
the guy i was talking to was using hyperbole ("he did it") and i used hyperbole to answer him ("he didn't do it").  it was obvious to everyone reading that we were not being literal.
i'm sorry you got confused.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:23:37
absolutely not.  that subreddit contains illegal material.  you may not link to it.
because that subreddit is part of reddit, you may not link to reddit either.
in fact, you must now delete your account.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:29:05
sorry, but no.  calling something an "aspect" does not imply it's a "bug".
don't make me pull out a dictionary.
bye now.
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:51:46
there is no solution here. if we encrypt everything, the ISPs will degrade all encrypted communication leading to exactly the same problem.
the fast lanes will simply require unencrypted data.
@_date: 2014-11-24 09:03:49


you just said you agreed to the opposite of that statement ("i mean, yeah i guess that's true".)  so now i am confused, too.
how can steganography be used to prevent comcast from throttling all data except for its video stream to one of its customers?
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:04:12
no seriously, he told me too.
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:18:44
and neither did Ross.
yet you keep insisting he did, and cannot even admit the mistakes in your own arguments.  meanwhile, Ross has never said anything bad about you.
Ross:1, you:0.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:31:47


@_date: 2014-02-18 15:19:46


yes.  but that was poor implementation.  and if it caused problems, it was the programmer's fault, not IP's fault.  amazon never said "we sent your books to the wrong place because IP has a bug.  why are you blaming us?"
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:30:54


my point is that you cannot use steganography to defeat fast lanes.
i proved this by providing an example of a fast lane that cannot be defeated with steganography.
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:41:30
but who would want to be able to hack all the crypto on the planet?
@_date: 2014-03-15 17:37:32
aaaaaah.  now i see.  i think you and i are just going to have to agree to disagree.
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:21:26


would you also agree that steganography cannot be used to prevent an ISP from throttling traffic that originates at another IP?  (comcast giving preferential treatment to netflix's traffic?)
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:48:31
so you can get the same effect here on reddit by removing the mods and replacing them with no one.
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:38:08
bye now.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:55:52
i could not disagree more strongly.
reddit mods are not omnipotent.  in most cases, they are barely competent.  they should not be empowered to police the postings any more than is barely needed.
YOU need to simply unlearn your expectation that people here won't lie to you.  they will.
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:37:12
yes it is.  perhaps you could ask your english teacher?
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:14:45
please understand that he is not indicted for the "hits".  they were mysterious dropped from his arraignment.
by repeating this fallacy, you're contributing to the misinformation campaign against him.
@_date: 2014-11-24 02:24:23
my argument that steganography cannot be used to prevent your ISP from throttling has nothing to do with steganography?  i think that's pretty trivially incorrect.
the whole point of this post is that cryptography can be used to prevent throttling.  my point is that that is incorrect.  and i cannot imagine why you're having trouble understanding my point (nevermind my argument.)
EDIT: did you perhaps miss the part about net neutrality in the title?
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:00:07


yes.  the obliviousness is breathtaking.
@_date: 2014-11-22 13:11:57

they want to block applepay because applepay keeps your identity private from them.  it won't allow them to track you by CC number anymore.  that's HUGE income for them (analytics on their customers.)
in this fight, applepay and bitcoin are fighting on the same side: privacy.
@_date: 2014-11-22 13:12:53
right.  and so only the big players will be able to have fast connections to the bitcoin network.

that's perfect, actually.  i've rented many houses in my life, about half the time i learn that i don't like the landlord.  (there's something wrong with landlords, it seems.)
it's much easier to work with the existing landlord than to move.
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:19:34
yes - that story was spread at the time of his arrest.  mysteriously, the charges have been dropped.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:49:37
it's not a back burner - they keep repeatedly saying i've sent the wrong documents when in fact i've sent them all the right documents over and over and over again.  when i ask for an explanation i get no response.
it's a scam now, pure and simple.  the lawsuit will be delicious.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:27:32
you want the US to treat bitcoin differently than any other foreign currency?
the reason the US doesn't tax gains on the dollar is because the dollar cannot gain on itself.  one dollar is always worth one dollar.

@_date: 2014-03-15 01:23:22
you seem to think there's some kind of "cost" to bitcoins having value, and that people will move to "less expensive" coins because they're less expensive.
do you understand that when you use a crypto currency to send $5 to your friend Joe, it does not matter in the least what the currency itself costs per unit?  it will still cost you $5 if your use bitcoin or dogecoin or litecoin.
unless the alternate currencies provide some seriously tangible reason for use - why would anyone bother using them?  the cost of a bitcoin is entirely immaterial.  entirely.
there is no pressure whatsoever to switch from bitcoin because of its cost per unit.  none.
@_date: 2014-03-15 10:31:44
heh... it sounds like you think the US dollar bill is a mirage, too.
(yes, taxes.  that's nonsense, the dollar's value comes from the same network effects you think are worthless.)
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:53:51
heh... sadly, i'm a bit tired of fighting the good fight.  you'll have to go insult someone else.  luckily you're vastly outnumbered, so i'm confident the truth will still come out.
take care.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:56:32
yes.  and like the wild west people are banding together to bring order.
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:43:01
i use betting to quiet blowhards.
when there is no cost to spewing nonsense - nonsense gets spewn.  add a cost and it suddenly vanishes.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:24:28
you seem to be unaware that people banding together can affect change.  which is odd... because that's exactly what the bitcoin community does every day.

i understand the desire the eliminate regulations.  regulations are created and enforced by humans in an inconsistent and messy way that is very often inefficient and often becomes corrupt.

on the contrary, nothing that happened here was unintended.

this has got to be one of the top 10 most twisted libertarian arguments i've ever heard.  allow me to rephrase slightly so that the absurdity here is obvious:
the US regulates the markets for safety - so people who want unsafe markets have to go elsewhere.  but those markets are unregulated and unsafe, and so those people got burned.
clearly the US regulations are to blame.  if they didn't exist, people could have gone to unregulated markets in the US and gotten burned there, instead.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:17:59

that's a metaphor.  specifically, a simile.  i did not mean it literally.
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:41:09


and that is still true.
BTC-E took about an hour to update their wallet.  it wasn't broken before, but they wanted to make extra sure there would be no problem with the DDOS.
the devs are scrambling now to eliminate any PERCEIVED problem with the client software.  they would not have to scramble if mtgox had not gotten the community so riled up.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:43:33
thanks for the clarification.  i was in shock when i first read the headline.
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:42:02
the spirit of the bet is "bitcoin will outperform BRK-A".
so yes, if bitcoin beats BRK-A by even 0.00001% that's still a win.
and BRK-A need only beat bitcoin by 0.000001% to win.
that's not in the least bit skewed.

to keep with the non-metricness of using the word "bit" instead of "micro" - i suggest that a bit **NOT** be a millionth of a bitcoin.  instead make it 1/1776th of a bitcoin (to celebrate the US declaration of independence.)

there's a theory that many non-programmers (like Buffett, etc.) don't understand that bitcoin-the-currency cannot be separated from bitcoin-the-transaction network.  they naively believe that dollars could be inserted here (which would be true if the bitcoin network were more like traditional financial networks, which are currency independent.)
and so they believe that bitcoin-the-currency is worthless while bitcoin-the-network has value.  despite the fact that you cannot have one without the other, and so the network GIVES value to the currency.

relative value is the only thing that makes any sense.  it's the expected interpretation any time anyone who knows anything about finance compares performance.
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:59:53
you know - there's another option to walking away and restarting everything.  and since walking away and restarting everything requires so much work, it's usually the preferred option.
for example, when you're bedroom is too hot, do you: a) turn down the thermostat or b) move to a new home?
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:59:13
fair point.
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:29:49
speaking of which - how do we get him removed?  surely there's a vote or something, yes?
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:45:45
why do you feel linear is more appropriate here?
the best way to visual long term growth is with a log scale.  otherwise the low end is flat.  growth is an exponential process.
EDIT: to elaborate - growth and performance are nearly always measured as a percentage change.  on a log graph changes in scale are remapped to linear, so that you can make sense of them despite the orders of magnitude difference across long timeframes. if i tell you that an asset has gone up $1 in value that is meaningless without a reference point.  if i tell you it has gone up 10% that's immediately understandable.
in summary - i believe you are full of crapola.
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:56:06

the problem is they started lying about it.  lying to our faces, a lot, about big things.  that's why they're going to jail.

yes, that's the tip-off that it's hyperbole.  like when someone says "that thing weighs a ton!" but it cannot possibly weigh a ton.

i think the family is still reeling from the dropped murder charges, and that's what they mean when they say "he could never have done it".
and regarding those charges, i don't think our community would say "there's nothing wrong with what he did."  if he did indeed try to hire a killer, i believe he should sit in a jail for a long long time.
but i don't believe he did that.  
sadly, it's very difficult to get to the main issue (the silk road itself) with all the swirling FUD.  
very similar to the Assange rape charges, now that i think of it.  curious, that.
@_date: 2014-03-15 10:26:38
agreed.  but after 20 years, i still primarily use the same old SMTP email.
if in 20 years i'm still using bitcoin, it will still have its value.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:44:00
yes, and i showed you that all regulations create these same bad outcomes.  even for laws you like, like those outlawing murder, arson, theft, tax evasion, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:26:18


you are correct.  but why on earth would anyone bother?  who cares what a bitcoin costs - it is still just as effective and INEXPENSIVE to send $5 to my friend.
likewise, someone could run a mail agent on port 26, and call it SMTP2.  but no one would do this because there is no need or advantage and until you have mass adoption, it's useless.

i've been trying to withdraw USD since the end of october.  mtgox refuses to verify my account, despite the fact i've sent them dozens of perfectly valid documents.

@_date: 2014-03-01 22:20:20
your argument hinges on the laws being unjust.  and so it cannot be used to show the laws are unjust.  that's circular.
the murder example proves this.  the murder laws create a black market and violence.  but you feel that's ok, because you feel the murder laws are just.
@_date: 2014-01-22 01:38:19
because that's how you write headlines.  i learned the rules when i was 10 years old - well before becoming a teenager, actually.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:24:43


given that it was a well documented situation - i believe the onus is on mtgox to 1) know about it and 2) work around it.  as a professional organization handling large sums of money, they are obliged to do both.  they did neither.
@_date: 2014-12-01 06:31:09
since you agree that:
1. cryptography and steganography cannot be used to prevent fastlanes
2. fastlanes are a violation of net neutrality
do you agree that cryptography and stenography cannot be used to enforce net neutrality?
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:19:54
right.  and the very next thing i said was about this.

specifically: you mention GLBSE.  perhaps it will have a competitor GLBSE2.  what's to stop these two from forming a duopoly identical to the republicans/democrats?  and hence bring us squarely back to where we are?

@_date: 2012-08-17 16:29:39


yes, exactly, you need to take the probabilities into account.  but that just improves my argument -
because bitcoin is going up, more and more people want to make money, so they're buying more, so it's going up.  the 1% and 99% in your example are reversed.  which makes even more people buy.  it's a feedback loop.
honestly, it's the economic singularity.

no - you were objectively wrong about the odds for &lt;32000.  seems odd that others would agree with you.


yes, you receive exactly 1/75% - the risk:1/reward ratio is exactly the same - as it is will all their bets.  there is no "better" bet.
@_date: 2012-12-23 19:04:24


you'd never use bitcoins to buy potatoes.  you use them to buy drugs, guns, the services of a criminal, or to pay-off an extortionist.
i.e. things that you cannot otherwise buy because of restrictions placed on online financial transactions.
that's why they have value.

@_date: 2012-10-06 04:07:21
no - the simple fact is that if you ignore these "magical papers" as you call them - you might very well find your freedom taken away.
i'm hard pressed to think of anything more relevant to a person - so i can only assume you are using a bad definition of "relevant" as i said - or perhaps you're delusional (seeming more likely.)

@_date: 2012-11-30 03:58:03
i hear what you're saying - start small and grow.
and in general i agree with that strategy.  however i think it is a poor one when looking at issues of crypto/security.  you better know before you begin whether it will work - piecemeal solutions tacked on the side do not go well.
i'd rather not be yet another example of a hacked bitcoin system.
@_date: 2012-08-03 18:57:54
as pointed out elsewhere, now that bitcoin price is in the double digits - it is impossible that it will crash to 0.
also, consider that the most bitcoin can go down is $11, whereas it can go up $12, $13, $20, $100 or even $1,000,000.
it is clear that the only logical choice is to purchase more bitcoin.

once bitcoin takes off - if there is indeed intelligent life in the universe - they will likely invest in bitcoin as well.
there is literally no limit to the upside here.
@_date: 2012-11-29 19:17:35

@_date: 2012-08-10 16:53:24
no - he's right - it is logically impossible right now for the price to go down - due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin and Obecalp's law.
my calculations show the price going to $20 by next week.
@_date: 2012-08-06 18:14:55
according to Obecalp's law - the price of bitcoin should at least double when the reward drops.

no friend, you're being ridiculous.  let's assume you're right, and the people you're describing are indeed sociopaths.  sociopaths who can imprison and maim and kill you.
what they do, what motivates them, how they hurt you is EXTREMELY relevant to your life.  ESPECIALLY if you feel they are unjust and irrational.
you're just using words wrong ("irrelevant" in this case) because you think it makes you look like a deep thinker.  trust me - you'll do a much better job at that if you just spend a moment to actually think deeply.

no, i understand i will not get SL's volume from day one.  however, i'd like to spend a little time planning the development path and understanding the limitations of the system.  if i found there was no way to overcome the 10 minute limitation, i don't think i'd try to use bitcoin as the backbone.
and no - i really don't think spending a day here talking about bitcoin's fundamentals is overplanning.


actually, no, that would be a dealbreaker.  try imagining a slot machine that takes 10 minutes to decide whether you've won or not.  it's not a system people would use.

you understand that with this much money in a large system, parallel attacks from botnets is a given.  it is not hard at all to create 10,000 accounts and have them act in synchrony.
furthermore, the game allows for arbitrary transfers.  so it is not necessary that the money is spent on virtual items - it is entirely possible that the money could be transferred out of the game entirely.

@_date: 2012-12-24 02:48:36
that's one way of interpreting him.  if that's what he meant, then he is incorrect - the silk road came online in feb 2011, when 1 BTC was worth about 0.2 USD.
but if that's what he meant, he's being ridiculous - the value of each unit weach other is utterly meaningless.  i could define my own currency QTC equal to 10000 BTC - and then claim that because 1 QTC is worth $100,000 - it must be a huge success!
or he might have meant abstractly - that due to its intrinsic nature, BTC is more valuable than USD.  but of course BTC is chock full of risk - much worse than USD.  so again he's being ridiculous.
and then there's his general premise - that illegal activities aren't important to the value of BTC.  which again is ridiculous - the silk road is doing business hand-over-fist - they easily account for the lion's share of BTC retail.
not even to mention that BTC became a household word when gawker ran the silk road article.
so.  nonsense all around.  but hey, that seems par for the course in this community.

@_date: 2012-11-29 17:04:41
i looked seriously at using bitcoin for the open source version of second life (opensim).  i believe the second life economy is the single greatest reason people continue to give second life its money ($100M a year) rather than move to a mostly equivalent open source project.
the problem i see is that transactions like these need to occur quickly - less than 10 seconds.  and bitcoin is substantially slower than that (10 minutes.)

@_date: 2012-11-29 21:11:27
right - but again you're describing throttling per user to mitigate damage. (keys, set of keys, etc.)  which isn't doable - a user may generate individual keys for each of his 10,000 $1 transactions... no?

yes.  "sending" bitcoins is just the act of announcing to the world that account A is sending X coins to account B.  in that announcement, account A proves he's the owner of the account with A's private key.  that announcement is recorded in the blockchain by all the miners.
so no, account B need not run any software to "receive" the coins.
@_date: 2011-06-10 16:01:22
yes - that's why i provided both pro and anti bit coin versions in my examples, above.

yes.  i'm talking about the "true" technological revolutions (email, web, etc.)  and i consider bitcoin to be on par with them.  if for no other reason than it's incredibly useful - and because no one "owns" it - which makes it very attractive to developers (like email and the web.)

@_date: 2011-06-25 13:40:40
well - no.  the issue is that if you use plain old arithmetic, you can rule out a LOT of cases because the integer coefficients will need to be divisible with the other constants.
in a finite field, all the integers are divisible.
@_date: 2011-08-13 00:30:04

agree or disagree: his/my argument holds if you don't use a finite field.
agree or disagree: the OP did not specify to use a finite field.
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:43:00
now don't be like that.  everyone makes mistakes from time to time.  talking about it will help give us closure.
@_date: 2011-06-07 21:12:31


you've got it backwards - his argument claims that people will hold on to dollars because they are increasing in value with respect to computers.
and yes, dollars are "deflationary" with respect to computers.  and yes, they are **currency**.  and yes, people still use them to buy computers despite the fact that if they held on to their dollars for just a little longer, they could get twice the computer.
@_date: 2011-06-21 03:15:31


to be fair, i think Kevin should wait until a judge or similar makes this decision before relinquishing his claim.
@_date: 2011-06-09 16:43:31

@_date: 2011-11-05 21:36:52
at 6 confirms, an attacker with 10% of the network has only 0.001% chance of succeeding at a double spend.
if you are comfortable with a lower level of confidence, then go for it.  the guy below claiming that 0 confirms is adequate is retarded.
@_date: 2011-08-09 15:55:40
the most damning thing here, IMHO, is that they cannot point to the transaction(s) that were theft.  if they really refuse to do so - there's no other explanation here than scam.

i'm going to guess you have no experience with distributed algorithms.
yes - this is a common property of them.  if you truly want no central bank, there are limitations, like this.  sorry, that's math.  1+1 does not equal 3 no matter how fair you think it'd be.
@_date: 2011-06-14 19:04:42
crazy much?
@_date: 2011-06-08 13:17:52
well - i'm not saying there can't be different rates of inflation/deflation.  and i'm not saying you can't switch out of it.
ok.  starting again - many people are arguing that no one will spend bitcoins because they are deflationary.
if that's true - then no one will hold dollars, either, because that's effectively the same.  so it won't be possible to buy things with dollars, because no one will have any dollars, because if they're too afraid to spend their deflationary currency on goods, they certainly won't buy dollars.  so in order to buy the goods with dollars, they'll have to first buy dollars with bitcoins.  which is just as bad as buying the goods with bitcoins to begin with.
a secondary currency does no good to escape the "no one will spend a deflationary currency" trap.
so the modern bitcoin IS analogously deflationary to the gold coins of yore.
@_date: 2011-07-07 01:40:11
as has been pointed out numerous times now - the US dollar is deflationary with respect to computer hardware: if you wait twelve months before purchasing, you can buy twice as much for the same amount.
and yet, people still buy computers.  the industry does quite well, in fact.
like many economic theories - deflationary hoarding sounds nice on paper - but doesn't actually work that way in the real world.
@_date: 2011-06-14 16:33:06


actually, i bought at $5 and sold half at $20 - effectively doubling my initial investment and keeping a bunch to play with.
@_date: 2011-07-04 14:50:35
i wonder at the hate.
@_date: 2011-06-25 15:25:58

@_date: 2011-06-20 03:07:06

@_date: 2011-06-25 01:03:48
well - my first concern is that if you know the coefficients are integers (or some other discrete unit) - does that give you "extra" information which you could use to crack the keys. seems closely related to diophantine equations - about which i (admittedly) know little.
@_date: 2011-10-07 15:48:53

@_date: 2011-06-08 00:31:51


you realize that if you spend your bitcoins to get dollars, and then use those dollars to buy goods - you have the same "deflationary" loss as you would if you used bitcoins to buy the goods directly.
having a secondary currency doesn't help you.
i guess you could say "no, i won't use bitcoins to buy dollars, i'll just have dollars lying around to use."  but that's not a possible save either - leaving your assets in dollars is the same deflationary loss, too.
@_date: 2011-06-09 03:00:52
yeah, except that doesn't describe the situation at all.
your hysteria speaks volumes for the legitimacy of your position.

but will that be practical once transaction volume is huge?
@_date: 2011-08-01 14:25:54
yeah, see, real developers create systems that can be tested.
it's why etrade, amazon, ebay, paypal, google, etc, etc, etc, etc don't have to roll-back transactions like mtgox does.
@_date: 2011-06-30 15:21:48
ahhh... truth.  how sweet it tastes.
@_date: 2011-06-25 17:28:08
agree or disagree: when someone asks "does 8+3=11" the most reasonable answer is "yes", not "i don't know, is that addition in the real field or a finite field?"
(the construction leaks information on the reals as well as the integers, as well as the rationals, as well as the complex field.  the crux is in divisibility of integers, as i said way back at the beginning, which does not affect finite fields as all the integers in a finite field are divisible by all the other integers.)
@_date: 2011-06-20 14:33:43

a problem is that mtgox has blind pools - basically bid/asks that are invisible to those charts.
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:00:07


yes, that's how salts work.  you misunderstand salts if you think otherwise.


@_date: 2011-09-01 14:12:27
@_date: 2011-08-12 19:06:32
yes, many MANY institutions extend the first month, six months, year, for free.  how can they give so much money away?!
this is because it's financially worthwhile - despite you're insulting tone, most consumers out there are "stupid" enough to use them as a long term cash lender, and giving the first month free is similar to the first one is free from the local drug dealer.
tl;dr - extending a line of credit is extremely lucrative for credit card companies - it is not something that costs them; it is something that generates them much revenue.
@_date: 2011-06-21 14:01:11

@_date: 2011-08-03 22:25:03

* you didn't (and still don't apparently) see what this issue is.


his argument is based on regular integer arithmetic - which is what the OP described, which is what i voiced my objection to.  and his argument (and mine) is valid: using integer arithmetic - the above construction leaks information, and attack against an unknown key is significantly aided by eliminating indivisible cases.

those transfers do not indicate transfer of ownership - just transfer of account.
the client aggressively creates new accounts - for instance, when making change.  nearly every payment creates a new account and transfers money into it.
so "transfers" in bitcoin have little resemblance to transfers in the real world.
@_date: 2011-09-09 02:00:08
you're an idiot.
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:33:02
you can quibble, i suppose, about whether the early adopters deserve this reward.  but keep in mind that successful internet inventors tend to (on occasion) reap massive rewards and we don't really fault them for it.
REGARDLESS -  there is way too much momentum behind bitcoin as it stands now for anything like this to change without fracturing/destroying the community.  it's silly to think otherwise.

@_date: 2011-10-13 02:33:36

you provide no arguments - just that "it feels like."  that's fine - but realize that "it feels like" invariable misses the revolutions.

it's why etrade, amazon, ebay, paypal, google, etc, etc, etc, etc don't have to roll-back transactions like mtgox does.
@_date: 2011-08-09 19:11:22
they should be able to, yes:
a double-spend transaction deposited funds into the thief's account.  the thief then withdrew those funds.
but the blockchain rejected the deposit since it was doublespent.
the admins need only look for deposits which are not present in the blockchain, and then see where those funds were transferred.

a technique i've been working on with GAs/fitness goes like this:
you have a few different scoring functions - you combine them into a single fitness function with simple multiplication and pow().
then when simulating - you arbitrarily shift the weights in the pow().  this effectively "tilts" the landscape of the fitness topology, and helps "jiggle" your GA free from any troublesome local minima.
this technique has helped me a LOT for getting out of local minima.
not sure how you'd implement it with this data, tho...

i didn't look very closely - but i think i understand:
he's just spending money out of a big pot.  that's how the protocol works - when you make a payment you take EVERYTHING out of the address and send it to two new addresses: one is the payee, and one is your own (new) address with the remaining amount.
EDIT:  yeah, i just looked again.  that's what it is.  maybe that's the pot at one of the exchanges and he's making payouts.

my apologies for the misunderstanding.
i don't think language choice is a terribly important decision here.  obviously security is the most important consideration - so you'd want to design the service to be intrinsically secure - so that even if the security of your language/execution environment fails entirely, damage is minimized.

if a node rejects transactions (which contain payment) they will make less money than a node which accepts such transactions.  in a survival of the fittest way - accepting nodes will be more successful and come to dominate the network.

well - if we assume that he's acting undemocratically (over half his users want a change but he ignores them) then it's safe to assume that gives him a competitive disadvantage against subreddits which will give the users what they want.
then why exactly should he expect to succeed?  one reason is his solitary claim to the subreddit name "bitcoin".  which means he succeeds unfairly.

when a person twists logic to support their irrational desires, it's called "rationalization".  this is what is happening when you make arguments that taxes are theft.
people rationalize things all the time.  the scientologists, for example, willfully believe that Xenu the space alien is the cause of all their problems.  there is no limit to what people can make themselves believe.
i have no interest in trying to argue against your rationalizations - such arguments will always fail because the rationalizer is already lying to himself, and has no problem creating new self-lies to cover the problems with the old self-lies.  and so the process is unending.
instead i typically end the conversation by saying:
shut up and pay your taxes you freeloading hippy.
you take care now.

i'm curious - do you believe there is a responsibility on the theater to ensure you have some place to go to when you leave?
or must he allow you to stay (for free, no less) until you find a home you find acceptable?
what a funny set of entitlements you come with, libertarian.

i like to think of proof-of-work like this:
the bitcoin algorithm is democratic.  the way it works is similar to voting - when a large group agrees on a decision - that's the decision which is "taken".
but it's not voting exactly.  it's probabilist voting.  instead of tallying-up everyone's vote to see who wins - instead one of the voters is chosen at random, and his decision is taken.  so it behaves very much like voting
; if 99% of the people agree, it's 99% likely that will happen.
but how do we "weight" these votes?  one per person?  one per computer?  one per IP address?  one per bitcoin address?
none of these are any good - each one can be cheated in one way or another.
instead, we weight by "one per unit of computational work".
it's not ideal, but it's immune to cheating.  if you can think of a better way, you're the next Satoshi.
EDIT: yes, i know the analogy isn't perfect.

do you understand that there is absolutely no way you can "filter" an entity effectively?
do you understand that satoshi dice has already paid tens of thousands of dollars to miners for their trouble?  much moreso than the freeloaders?

shall i assume you concede my point about exclusive use of the name "bitcoin"?
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:21:32
ummm... it's impossible to evaluate its strengths without knowing it's algorithm and code.  of course i know it's open source.  it's common knowledge.
that in no way makes it immune to flaws.  distributed algorithms are notoriously difficult to write.  this one is extremely complex.  it's almost certain it still has many undiscovered flaws.  the only question is how bad are they.
so no sir, you are completely and entirely incorrect when you say adoption is the only thing on which bitcoin's success rests.

my analogy for game theory in economics:
it's like using the elastic collision equations to  determine the behavior of people packed into a subway at rush hour on a hot day.

i'm arguing that if you don't own the trademark for "bitcoin" you ought not profit from its exclusive usage.

it proves that BTC will be at $500 by christmas.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:31:48


yes.  mtgox should have done that.
and that's exactly why they are to blame.
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:44:37
honestly, we're used to seeing the saturation blown-out in our graphics.  
if anything, you need blue.

yes. if you can think of a better way, you're the next Satoshi.
EDIT: i'll assume by your downvote that you are unable to think of a better way.  don't feel so bad, no one can.  that's why we're stuck with what we've got. 
@_date: 2013-03-17 16:18:02


it's infinitely divisible.  if 1 satoshi ever becomes too small, we'll increase the resolution.  so it doesn't matter what numbers you pick.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:46:52
the main difference here is that the taxable event for bitcoin is the conversion to dollars.  so it's not possible to get caught in the middle like this poor chump.
that said - the moral still holds.  talk to a tax guy.  it would suck to make a million dollars being smart with bitcoin and then lose it all being dumb with finances.
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:36:07
umm... tell you what - why don't you email the reddit admins and see if they agree with you.

clearly he's trying to steal all the bitcoin profit for himself.
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:42:17
well, it sounds very much like you are personally advocating these claims.
if you are not - then don't take my comments personally - i am targeting the claims only.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:50:30


i know you feel that way; you've said that.  i disagree.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:21:37
regardless of the inherit strength of a technology/stock/commodity -
when the value shoots up like bitcoin's has - people will buy it simply because it's shooting up.  these people will then dump it quickly when it falters.
a bubble is inevitable, IMO.
@_date: 2013-07-27 17:57:41
fair enough.  take care.

not really.  everyone here says "i guess".
i'd prefer an "i know".

heh... there's a lot to take issue with here.  but i'm just going to pick just my favorite:


do you realize that a large number of people opt to not have income?  i dare say more people opt out of working than opt out of purchasing.

nope, never said that.  maybe you're hearing things?
take care now.

dammit - i had by buy at $32.
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:46:54
to be clear on my side, i'm not specifying how he will defend himself.  only that he will not be convicted of putting out a hit.  agree that a plea nullifies the bet.
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:47:19
i think the more likely explanation is that he feels giving the rich more power than the poor is a problem.  but i suppose we won't know until he weighs in.
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:22:02
you're assuming it doesn't have some yet undiscovered tragic flaw.
that's a big assumption.
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:22:15
i don't understand why anyone would take sides in the coinlab vs. mtgox fight.
coinlab is new and untested.  mtgox is old and corrupt and incompetent.  if one should step down, they both should. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 19:32:05
i agree.  i'm just trying to get the facts straight.  if anyone can tell me definitively whether SD is currently paying transaction fees (and what %) i'd be much obliged.
@_date: 2013-03-17 19:08:10
i know.
the bitcoin community is chock-full of people who speak with authority despite being mostly ignorant.  it's a pet-peeve of mine.
@_date: 2013-01-13 11:44:59
no, actually, i understand that completely.
i also understand that is full of imbeciles who are dying to look smart by criticizing each other.   not unlike a room full of grammar nazis.
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:56:26


so by your logic, because police need guns to enforce murder laws - that means people don't like murder laws?  is this also a sign of tyranny?
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:14:30
i'd like to point out that if we'd done absolutely nothing - everything here would have worked out anyway.
the bitcoin algorithm isn't so fragile that a couple bugs can take it out.
@_date: 2013-07-27 04:58:18
heh.  well, can't argue with that logic.
@_date: 2013-07-26 18:52:27
the mod.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:20:31
you're absolutely right - this will never burst.  you should borrow against your house and invest it ALL in bitcoin, right now.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:50:33


the name of the phenomenon, if you're not already aware:
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:01:07
can we all please remember that once mtgox gets your money, they won't give it back:
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:09:36


the reason i like to point out mtgox's failings is not because i am a troll - it's because not too long ago they let their password file get stolen - and instead of taking the blame said "we didn't lose our password file, the guy we sent it to did."
and now today i get targeted phishing email because i was unlucky enough to have been one of their users.
@_date: 2013-07-26 15:54:19
and that itself is a problem.  when did we get a dictator?

here you go - make any rules you want.
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:24:43
if 75% of the market is backing the rigged system, why would it crash?
and even if it did - that would be a slow process - the rich would be able to use it until the crash, and then transfer their power to the new system and milk it.  repeat.
that's what's happening with the banks today, right?


i don't understand your question.  which part do you see as infeasible?
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:55:37


precisely.  bitcoin works BECAUSE people will act selfishly.  asking people to act unselfishly creates the wrong impression: that we must all cooperate for this thing to work.  that's entirely untrue.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:15:15
i have this piece of poop i'd like to sell you.  it only costs $10,000.
since no one will ever buy it from you - you'll have lost nothing!  i'll even give you back $1000 after we're done, and you'll have MADE MONEY!  and POOP!
EDIT: what, you don't want my poop?  c'mon, my poop is going to make you rich.  don't blow this opportunity.
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:36:54
no, it was not.  when you purchase property encumbered with an HOA you get it whether you want it or not.  likewise the governmental encumbrances.
@_date: 2013-05-25 17:07:46
hey - i thought libertarians preferred free market solutions to rules imposed from above.  i guess not.
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:37:46
the situation here is complicated.  if the head mod had created the trademark "bitcoin" i would feel differently.  but it is not his.
