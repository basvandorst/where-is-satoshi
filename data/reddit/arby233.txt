What happens when the supply caps? Who (or what) will secure the network?

I mine Doge, but if I need to buy something with BTC, then I will exchange. I still support Bitcoin and am always watching where we'll go. Bitcoin will explode in popularity in the near future.

I was watching CNN's Marketplace Middle East (IIRC), and they said that Iran is "one of the few untapped markets left in the world..." Now, because Bitcoin transcends international borders and sanctions, think of the possibilities that could be unlocked with a Bitcoin revolution in Iran.

So... the transaction fees are "recycled" for use in mining?

The cover art designer didn't do their research... :(

Calling for a NASCAR… as a Dogecoiner and a Bitcoiner, will root for the 98 and the 23! Vroom vroom!

A few of those anti-Bitcoin people legitimately have good arguments against it, but these are crowded out by those who flat-out reject any chance of Bitcoin's viability.

Litecoin, Doge, Darkcoin, and other top coins are not on the cover?
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:25:59
No, I checked on the magazine's website and none of those were on there.

Regardless, since Bitcoin doesn't have rules on who you can send money to, so Bitcoin makes sanctions irrelevant.

Nice work!

If only I had any Bitcoin...

m'bitcoin sponsors le REAL sports!!!!!!!
But seriously, the Bitcoin community itself can pull enough money to sponsor a DOTA player. Bitpay is a private company, so they can do whatever they want.

Kyle Busch, top-series driver in the 18 car and owner of the 54 truck, could become a big advocate of Bitcoin. He's one of the more polarizing figures in NASCAR, so a lot of attention goes to him. Anyways, a truck sponsor is probably around $30,000-$50,000, and so far, it's only one race.
Kyle Busch could be an interesting figure in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:05:22
He could still support it and possibly tweet about it.

They are two different series, and Doge only raised $10k this time around. Don't know what will happen, but PPR could put the Doge on the back for a race.

Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, hmm... No, that's impossible!

Went to 'Dega to see both times. NASCAR fans take to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram quite a bit. Everyone's taking pictures and videos with smartphones, so they have a huge communication bonus.
