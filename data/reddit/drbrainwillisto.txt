It was about volatility 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:56:11
The money is flowing today boys!
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:36:48
Bitcoin the wrong crypto for that. You want monero 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:54:52
I've been holding since it was $30 nothing new for me 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:29:51
Rip 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:11:19
Count me in! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:54:56
My thoughts exactly 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:54:36
Yep. A Mt.Gox branded one. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:15:32
That's .6 percent. That's nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:11:17
Check this out, just found out about this today after some googling! The unlock codes for it were leaked in 2014, so it can be used again for other applications now. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 03:23:17
This is a portrait of a man named Satoshi. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 17:18:25
Muslim isint even a race anyway. It's a bullshit religion. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:12:15
And yet here we are today. They attacked and Bitcoin recognized the fault, repaired itself, and ejected the bad transaction via a fork. The way the attack was handled is truly what shows how resilient bitcoin is. Even if it does get hacked, it won't be too long before everything gets repaired and reset. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:31:02
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:04:58
Nailed it 
@_date: 2014-11-15 14:37:05
You are a fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 03:22:29
Here is 12 fps if anyone is interested.  
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:13:20
You would think a company this size could spare a little more than .2 Bitcoin lol. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:56:53
Shhhh don't disturb the Bitcoin bull 
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:57:37
The point is, the one that honored the smart contract in this case is clearly the corrupted one. On a small scale, there would be no talk of this intervention. This was a major event that happened while Etherium is still in its infancy. Having human intervention is justifiable and demonstrates that in extreme cases, humans can intervene and make the correct decision.  
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:57:56
You're a scam. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:11:38
You are suppose to. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:59:01
I highly doubt we will see $1000 again. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:47:49
Shit I’m getting 12k memes ready at this pace
@_date: 2017-04-18 02:55:07
Sure, there is room enough for etherium and bitcoin to coexist. They serve different purposes. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:21:55
Bitcoin is backed by its utility and faith in the system, just as most other currencies are. The deflationary nature of its code drives long speculation, driving the price upwards over time. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 18:20:39
Just so everyone is aware, it went from 2¢ per gallon to 94¢ per gallon 
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:41:06
No. Firstly because the issue is already being addressed by segwit. Secondly the fees are still very cheap for standard transactions, just no longer feasible for micro transactions. There are plenty of altcoins that are great for that, bitcoin does not need to address every single issue crypto currencies have the potential to solve. It has proven itself to be a very solid long investment thus far, and that is enough to continually drive the price upwards imo. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:28:41
Well it's price has increased so its utility as a store of value has improved. New applications are being made daily. More and more people are joining the system. Its utility has only increased so far. Fast clearing transactions are only a small part of what bitcoin is good for. It's at a stage where people don't want to rush any changes, understandably. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 13:36:22
Underdeveloped compared to the us? Lmao 
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:06:18
Bitcoin doesn't really need to have fast clearing times. Alt coins can carry that burden. Bitcoin is the store of value crypto. As a comparison, consider the value of the entire gold trade, a market cap of 7.75 trillion. If you order gold online it an take a week before it arrives.

Dilly dilly 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:11:03
Title gore
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:56:52
Literally that dude is a fat fuck
@_date: 2015-11-21 16:33:19
I have no desire to profiting of this. The devs get their own cheap hardware and assemble it themselves. This is just the cop out script kiddie version. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 13:00:40
Actually you can lmao owned 
@_date: 2015-11-21 12:51:42
Right. What a piece of trash. 400 bucks for something you can assemble yourself for 100. Can't wait till this shit company folds up in the coming years. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:27:08
All the stuff you need to assemble yourself already exists under 100. I'm just saying this is pointless. I don't intend to try and one up them lol. Nice try though. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:34:03
I think he's talking about spending 50k USD LOL
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:19:13
No, it was butterfly labs. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 13:02:46
Open source or die. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:52:43
Exactly. So dumb. I'm glad there is Bitcoin tipping here. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:33:36
I don't get it. You buy "bits" to spend real money on "cheers" which is just a little animated symbol that pops op in the chat? Can the streamer cash the "cheer" in and exchange it for real money? Or does twitch just keep the money? This seems so dumb 
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:28:29
We don't need an update every 5 mins... We get it. Price is going up. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:58:15
Warning! Death screech that auto plays in this link.

1599.99 on btc china seemed to be the limit for tonight 
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:29:36
perfectly legal.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:56:10
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:50:28
Sure did recover fast though :)
@_date: 2013-09-20 05:20:26
If its using thermal paper, don't expect it to last more than 2 years once printed. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:04:54
I am in the process of implementing it already. Just trying to judge what the reaction will be. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:45:13
Nice! I will definitely do that.
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:48:51
2 TH/s and lets say 10000 watts @ .12 cents a watt. That comes out to $11156.22 a week. That seems pretty fucking profitable to me...
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:47:26
Good point. It definitely can't hurt anything. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:00:13
Tank so I can buy more plz :)

@_date: 2013-10-04 14:20:13
Coinbase I believe, I have accounts for both. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 19:07:18
That is the lagiest fucking site ever. I had to stop reading. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:19:32
I will give a 15 percent discount for paying with bitcoin. Does that sound reasonable? 
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:21:08
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:33:45
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:24:43
lol thats what I figured. The blast is a piece of shit. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:09:46
You mean 269.79?
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:17:49
how does bitcoin tip work?
