I bought at 8000$ on wednesday. It dropped to 7500 Thursday, so i bought some more. I wake up today at 7000$ and I really want to buy more, but my i cant bring myself to. Im supposed to be buying once a week, not once a day

I buy crypto weekly from my RBC bank account, so yeah I believe him

I use dca very generally. I buy btc weekly and i dont even consider the transaction fees as theyre negligible on kraken. Im more worried about the fees i pay to get my money ON kraken

When recessions hit people look to hedge their money in a store of value. Stocks are falling. Banks offer negative interest rates. Fiat value is falling. What do you do? Gold. Bitcoin, maybe.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:28:16
Didnt know that. If wallets actually deny invalid wallets, you just taught me something new
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:53:01
Jumping and moving around 3% daily isnt a great store of value though, theyre right
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:57:39
I dont even keep track of how much btc i have exactly. I just buy a certain amount every Wednesday or Thursday.
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:43:18
Also cant buy the dip if youre already all in

Its not, but i was arguing against the cheap fees on the comment above mine
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:55:16
How many people do you know that have 250k sitting in their bank account? Unless that figure includes investments made with the bank, i cant imagine more than a couple hundred people actually lost any money
That being said, how many wallets were lost and how many transfers were made to wrong addresses? Yes its the users fault,  but its awfully easy to mess things up with the current state of wallets  
I can guarantee more money was lost from lost btc than failed banks
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:31:01
No, i just put the same amount in on kraken every week and move it off into my private wallet every month or so. I guess kraken logs my deposits so maybe that is what I’d use to track my savings? To be honest i dont pay much attention to it because its an accumulation stage anyway, one month price will be 10k, the next 8k, the next maybe 12 and the one after maybe 6. It doesnt matter in the long run. Just keep dca-ing
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:09:50
I got a student loan last week.. if it hits 6k im putting it all in. If not, ill just dca it as i always do

For on the spot transfers, e-transfers are still cheaper (free) though. Bitcoin isnt bad, its just not better than the current system. Unless of course youre moving big amounts like this guy

LN isnt widespread and can be very complicated to get into, so you cant use LN as the example of bitcoin transactions. If were talking for the common joe, the most he could do would be downloading a wallet on his phone and using his and others’ public keys to send funds, the usual way. 
As for ‘not really your money’, banks have a track record of not-messing-up your funds, generally anyway. Snags will happen with any centralized system and Im sure youd have a really cool story about how the bank left you on hold for a while, but realistically, its not as big a hassle as youd make it sound and the safety, user-friendliness and comfort a bank offers is, for now, more appealable to the average guy. Its not a matter of messing up 1 character out of 50 and losing your entire transfer irreversibly.

The picture is basically showing how much of the worlds population could have 1 btc each (its the number of bitcoin in yellow overlayed on the esrths population in blue). 
As the population grows, the blue area will get bigger, while the yellow area stays the same, meaning less and less of the population (proportionately) will own btc. 
Long story short; more time= more population = more scarcity = more money for those who hodl

You can use an id without the address maybe? Or get a “bad” fake id for 20-50$ just for the kyc. If you inow anyone that is good with photoshop that could work too. Not the most ethical way but hey, its *your* btc

Actually in canada, i go to a canada post and use a QR code to fill my account. Im relatively sure this is anonymous for the bank (it shows up as canada post on my bank account, not kraken) and the fees are only a couple percent, maybe 4% after CP and kraken? Not too bad
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:37:14
Not an increase in demand, the demand is the same but the price increases as the supply slows down. Atleast theoretically thats what would happen

He paid a small fee so the transfer most likely took a while, so for a long time he might be stressing about accidentally sending the 49M to the wrong wallet

He means not to have investments as he suspects the market will crash. 
That being said, time in market&gt;timing the market. We might see a recession this year, or in another 5. Nobody can accurately time the market and doing so consistently is nothing but gambling

Im not sure. By my math itl take 8 months for me to achieve my btc goal. It makes more sense to buy bigger amounts now that im very happy with the price. Even if i double my dca, in 4 months the price could easily be sitting at 15k

You really had to keep it going? By definition an opinion can’t be wrong or right; its a personal perspective. Such you seemed to have an opinion at first, but now youre just an asshole
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:17:39
Opinion: *a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.*
Your opinion cannot be wrong because it is your own perspective of a situation (gravity in this case). Although your judgement being made without prior knowledge is obviously wrong, now were getting into the details which obviously isnt what my point was
I was more referring to opinions on subjective issues like TA, where you can be equally as successful with or without it. You can find TA useful or useless, either way, youre not wrong.

Couple days i reckon. 
In all seriousness, Venezuela is only the beginning. Btc has the potential to replace the weaker fiat currencies slowly but surely as well as serving as a store of value for others, etc. Even if bitcoin never becomes a universal currency, just by it being used in 3rd world countries you’ll see a lot of growth. It will prove that bitcoin CAN infact be used as currency over fiat. It will help clear negativity surrounding “crypto” or btc. 
Not to mention the more btc is used, more stable it is.. which ultimately is why a lot of people dont use it.

Ive been holding on to my bags for over a year and a half now, not everyone is in a financial situation where they can do the same. 
I have alts that I bought at 8 cents, that hit 70+ and that are now a fraction of a cent because I held for the “long term”. I believe(d) in the project and look where that got me. The average person doesnt believe in or understand the importance of cryptocurrency and as so as an investment, crypto has been a really shitty one lately. Hopefully thatll change relatively soon
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:57:58
I bought a half bitcoin when it was worth 15,000USD. Everyone from my own mother to friends and others have told me cut my losses and sell what i have. They were probably right, but if you invest in bitcoin you better be confident that itll serve a real life purpose. Or else youll just have weekly heart attacks

This saddens me. I know, thats just what capitalism is, but EVERYTIME you make a good trade, its because someone else made a bad one. It hurts to think of those who bought in at 20,000+ only to sell at a fraction of the price.

First rule of TA is that we cannot predict the future, but it CAN help understand certain situations better than without it. A golden cross doesnt been BTC to the moon, but it DOES mean BTC has been doing better now than the longterm trend, which could lead to higher highs and lower lows. 
Use it, dont use it, it doesnt matter. It is ignorant to say it is useless considering the sheer amount of people that have success solely on TA. That on its own should be enough to change your opinion

With icos its always been sell earlier than you think you should. 
Ive got close friends who have made hundreds of thousands (before crash) just off of the pyramid scheme icos (bitconnect-esque ones). 
Lets not lie to ourselves. When crypto goes maisntream, you get idiot investors coming in who follow anything with hype. Shitcoins who have no reason to go up except for youtube videos hyping them will make u loads of cash just for that reason
