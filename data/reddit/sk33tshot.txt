Yeah, no. There's no point in living forever if we don't have anywhere to live on. Also, the world would be better for the majority if a few people alive today bit the dust.

Actually, because of staggering climate change, polar bears are being forced south from the melting tundra of northern Canadian territories and into forested areas of Manitoba and Ontario. So, technically, polar bears too :)

I was down on my fiat investment for 2 years before I saw any gains. Take the time to learn the tech and take comfort in that.

You're going to need a safe and an armed guard of if you buy this and ship it to the address where your trezor is. Even if you're keys are in a different location. A loaded gun pointed at your head will "hack" a physical wallet. I wouldn't want to trust a third party with a database of trezor locations to keep that info private.

I think you're missing the point. People are not hyped on the tech. People are hyped on the fact that a major traditional institution is not resisting crypto, but finding ways to embrace it and move in the right direction. It's easier than fighting a revolution if the tech is accepted as evolution.

No it is not. Holding an asset that has the potential to increase in value is hardly illogical. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:13:42
I don't care if Bitcoin grows longterm. I'm holding for investment purposes. It is an alternative asset, like gold, in my portfolio. When it's time to sell, I will cash out. This might be counter to your views, but is far from illogical. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 23:26:03
I'm holding until I achieve a 15% gain, then out. It is a prediction, but I assume that will be short term. I don't care if the tech grows, all I care about it market price.  
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:44:12
No argument on spending. You said holding was illogical. I disagree.

Why do an AMA when you can't ask you anything? This seems like a publicity stunt to proactively try to keep the angry hordes of claimants at bay, while you know the probable outcome will not instruct you to disperse the lost coins.

Curious about this. Can you provide me details?
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:40:04
Yep. Utilizing it for transactions is fine, but utilizing/selling it as an investment is not. My question for this is the person who buys 100 BTC "solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services", but it just happens to increase in value. Do they want a person to report cap gains on each transaction? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:55:12
You'd gain extra heat generated. That could be a good or bad thing depending on the application of the machine and the geography of the user.

If I buy apple stock (in a non tax-sheltered account) and it appreciates in value, and I sell it at a gain, then I just triggered a taxable event (cap gains). As a Canadian, if I buy USD or an investment that tracks USD (ETF) and it appreciates in value, and I sell it - I triggered a taxable event ([cap gains]( I may be ignorant, but what is the difference between buying a foreign currency (USD) or BTC? If I use bitcoin for a purchase is that different than me selling it on an exchange for fiat? Any help would be awesome.
