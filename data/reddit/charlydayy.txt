Which is **exactly** what they're worried about...

Steve Jobs was a business man that totally believed in censorship, and keeping technologies proprietary. Fuck all the lemmings that think he was some how anything other than interested in how much profit he could make. 
Sure, I'll give him the fact that he did care about his products, but that only goes so far.

Adam Beck is a piece of shit who has no technical fortitude is the problem. I can't understand why they want to run BTC into the ground. People are jumping ship quickly, they need to do something before we all lose out on the one true BTC! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:30:14
LOL... Good luck doing this for all crypto currencies. Monero? IOTA? The point is... these fuckers opened a can of worms they can't possibly comprehend, let alone put borders around.
Let them think they can... their ignorance will only create more opportunities. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:10
Somebody *boo* this man! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:34:49
That's fine and all... but god damn, the dev team needs to really consider how to scale the motherfucker and be TRANSPARENT about it. There is literally NO roadmap other than Lightening (which is very exciting btw). We need a team that has vision, and a plan to get there while sharing that to market to the masses. 
Planning and PR has been done VERY poorly from Core, which is exactly why loud mouth Ver is gaining momentum. Andreas is our hero, but nobody on MSN is inviting him. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:23
But increasing block size is unsustainable with regards to commercial transactions. So L2 has to be the solution.

He's paranoid b/c he's forced to pay his hard earned money to a racket of criminals? What?
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:15:30
The Revolutionary War was fought over a 3% tax. I pay on average 35% in taxes. Enough is enough. I don't need all of your shit, I need my money to be spent the way I decide it to be spent. Not all taxes are bad, but to the extent that they are today, it's borderline slavery. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 01:25:49
Agreed. We don't need to be barring anything... the only thing it does is increase awareness, and desire to procure it at that point. 
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:29:23
It's the crystal!!

Chump change for this guy... but still cool none the less. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:27:14
Jesus Christ thats scary. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 22:18:58
Wow! 
@_date: 2018-10-25 15:58:21
Ever heard of 'cold storage'? Its really simple to take your money offline and put it in a place even more secure than your bank. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:50:58
This is pretty compelling and powerful news. I'll be interested to see if this benefits Crypto as a whole, or a select few heavy hands from the banks. 
Seems like a good opportunity for banks to get involved with moving money without oversight.

Who brought the jew?
@_date: 2019-08-11 21:51:47
Genius idea! I need this stamp so i can do the same.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:40:46
Havent tried. Going to consider converting, problem is that i use Outlook App and Microsoft has made it a bitch to connect less than known 3rd party email systems.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:40:12
This has been onesy twosey emails. Def not a mass email.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:27:02


Not even close...
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:47:45
So we're all excited about more future's? I don't understand. That shit destroyed BTC last time, which is the reason it was implemented last time and passed regulatory systems so quickly. They needed a tool to tame the beast. 
Future's are bullshit.
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:16:40
Yea maybe in 2017. lol
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:33:39
Every email I'm sending without it is going through. The ones with it, are not. I'll make a video and share.

@_date: 2019-10-20 21:27:26
Local Bitcoins is very unique isn't it? Considering every other avenue to acquire Bitcion, it stands out to me, most in particular the crackdown that I assume governments are planning with it.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:14:55
Please elaborate... you've failed to make a point.
@_date: 2019-12-15 17:55:38
Yes. This dude is legit, the devils right hand.
@_date: 2019-12-09 13:40:41
Why is this the "worst"? Don't you want topline security?
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:47:13
So how does socialism empower the masses then? It's still an elected body (the few) who have power over the majority. How do you consider this to be any different than what you have today? You can call the US a "capitalist" country all you want. The cold-hard truth is that its a Democratic Socialist country. Its exactly what you want...
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:13:38
Keeping living in your fantasy world dude. 
The biggest country of democratic-socialism the world over is The United States Of America. 
Its not new, its not hip, its dangerous and DOES NOT WORK IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE MASSES. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:58:54
Personal freedom and sovereignty is all that matters... nothing else.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:23:08
According to LinkedIn and WSJ... Bitcoin is the deadest it's ever been based on trading volume. 
Maybe what they're not seeing is that more and more people are holding everyday.
@_date: 2019-12-08 16:58:18
The banks rule the world. We know this, its not anything new. 
With that knowledge, we know also that they are the ones who rule our Governments. 
So my question is this... why then, have these banks not lobbied to make crypto completely illegal? Why are they so quiet about it?
The only answer I can think of is that they're smart enough to know that if you make something illegal, it only increases its value due to the black market? 
Still having a hard time wrapping my head around why they've been so relatively quiet about it as a whole. Anyone have good insight on this?
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:20:39
Don't play the halving game... I bought LTC months in advance of the halving only to see the price be the one cut in half (or more). Its a market that's heavy-handed with a few controlling sources. Play it safe boys.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:41:47
Exactly. People are worried about Bitcoin causing global warming while they drive around in their suburbans, eat at Chickfila, and live in their oversized home.
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:56:37
It's wheelbarrals here in OK too kind sir. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:58:45
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:25:12
Exactly. Bitcoin is a protocol, not a product or service
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:18:29
Do you believe that remains true for any crypto that is trying to be a SOV, or form of digital cash? 
Is it possible that the market will choose to have two options, one as a SOV and the other as a transactional/cash-like option? Curious.
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:47:44
This makes sense. Great insight.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:32:33
Yes, that means, anti-socialism. If it were pro-socialism it would empower the Government. 
Stop romanticizing about socialism. Thanks
@_date: 2019-12-14 17:56:54
This moron has a special place in hell.

Not only would we be much safer, but we would all be much richer, and have FAR LESS OF A POLICE STATE.
The only crime is a violent crime I've always said. Good luck convincing the lemmings though.
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:57:40
Why "least likely" by US curiously?
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:56:54
I like that this guy comes to a Bitcoin subreddit just to let everyone know how bad it is. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:17:12
Its really not that low still. We're holding fine IMO

Everyone here is acting like we have NO influence of law. And while I fully relate and understand that feeling, if we can convince the minds of people that BC is beneficial to them, then what's to stop us? Public opinion is the greatest influence. Unfortunately the corporate media had them pretty engrained to their narrative. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:53:54
Morons would sell anywhere above $1000.

What is the hashtag  supposed to stand for?  
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:41:11
You would think this would create scarcity, thus creating demand for a black market. Bitcoin isn't illegal in China, it's just ICO's I thought?
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:37:32
Okay, chill out there Kurzweil. Nobody here is advocating for technology overlords

Curious, why do we HAVE to move to 2x? Aren't there enough devs not wanting to implement?

So does that mean another split of the coin? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:21:39
Can someone explain to me how they are able to sell their BCH? I'd like to sell it, but I dont want to screw up by using my private keys that were from before and then not having BTC anymore. It's so confusing on how I could have TWO different coins and money in both out of thin air?

Can someone tell me why McAfee would be on here? Hes a huge proponent of BTC.

Cronyism does not = capitalism. Cronyism = capitalism + government regulation/intervention.

Yea... just like i said. Future's are dangerous. I have no doubts this will bounce back, but the question is... when?

FUCK YOU BAKKT! You could have done this last year and saved the goddamn bear market, but you didnt. You're a little pussy who doesnt deserve our attention anymore. PEACE.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:56:25
That was bullshit... they pulled out due to price drop, not to "regulatory" anything. Its all lipservice.
