Here are some key points either quoted or paraphrased:
- Individual Bitcoin users aren't MSBs
- "being a financial institution comes with certain responsibilities"
- Liberty Reserve "deliberately designed to avoid regulatory scrutiny and tailored its services to illicit actors looking to launder their ill-gotten gains." 
- Some criminials used Liberty Reserve to engage in "credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, narcotics trafficking, and most relevant for today’s purposes, child pornography."
- "With this [Liberty Reserve] action we were not painting with a broad brush against an entire industry. I do not think that is fair to any industry in any situation, let alone this one."
- "One of those obligations is a responsibility to put effective AML controls in place 
so that the type of criminal actors that showed up in the Liberty Reserve case are not able to 
operate with impunity in the U.S. financial system."
- Closing statement: " However, I would like to close with a challenge to our great 
innovators: extend your focus to devising creative solutions for preventing the abuse of virtual 
currencies by criminals, such as those who would exploit children. We all stand to benefit from 
such innovation, and the related transparency and integrity to our financial system."

It sounds like you're referring to a device-managed wallet (like the original Bitcoin-QT software) vs. a web-based wallet. That's an important distinction to make when you're using the b-word.

Page 46: you might want to mention that US States have individualized Money Transmitter Regulations. FinCEN registration is quick and simple. The real beast would be state money transmitter license approval. For example, California has a very broad interpretation of what constitutes money transmission. See news on the Bitcoin Foundation cease and desist letter. Additionally, there's a lot of variability in surety bond requirements from state to state. It's worth its own slide if you ask me.

I'll take a stab.
Faucets can take up to a day before your transaction shows. These transactions are done in bulk to save on transaction fees.
