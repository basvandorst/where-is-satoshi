Yeah, that's true
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:13:06
I noticed the same thing while watching the news the other day. I wasnt watching long but might be something.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:50:19
cool, cheers!
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:05:58
that was really really good dude
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:25:58
I believe it's growth but I want it to be a bubble so I can buy for a ripe price.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:34:40
u got me question marking dude (( ???? ))
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:30:04
i'd store your bitcoin on blockchain.info/wallet until your hardware wallet arrives, and i'd keep your recovery phrases on paper, enabled 2-step authentication, second wallet password, etc. used blockchain.info's wallet since october 2016, never had an issue. will be fine as long as your computer is clean! (i recommend the ledger nano S, mine just arrived and i love everything about it)
as for buying, i recommend coinfloor.co.uk - all in all i've bought 3 bitcoins from these guys in total, they're really good. never once had an issue with them. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:44:08
thats true, thanks for letting me know. will consider this when i store the other half!
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:25:16
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:29:47
isn't electrum meant to be good?
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:11:19
thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:41:31
Coinfloor. Can't recommend them enough.
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:24:50
something like this maybe  ? or you could just accept bitcoin and shapeshift.io the btc into whatever you want. other than that i aint too sure, sry bro
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:50:16
your average user thats new to bitcoin isn't going to want to splash out on a hardware wallet straight away. open source online wallets with 2FA enabled on a secure PC is more than enough imo.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:52:41
haha for sure
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:01:07
what blessedbt said. i'd move your bitcoin off of coinbase asap, you currently don't own that bitcoin.
i strongly recommend moving your funds on to an open source wallet where you control the private keys until your hardware wallet arrives.
for mobile devices i've heard good things about mycelium and coinomi. i personally used coinomi and never had an issue with it. mycelium is also good from what i've heard.
people also speak highly of electrum - i personally used blockchain.info's wallet for awhile without issues though.
good luck=)
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:57:31
seems it aint done just yet B) coming though, im feeling it

i'd recommend the ledger nano s, got mine not too long ago and im really happy with it. if they were to go under, it wouldn't matter - you could restore your coins on most other wallets using your recovery phrases.
when it comes to storing your bitcoin seed, keeping it on paper isn't the worst idea, however - i would personally use the operating system Tails with all networking disabled and have your seed in the KeepassX password database on board the O.S.
Tails is most commonly used by whistle blowers and is designed around security and privacy. for an extra layer of security you could use the virtual keyboard on the OS in the rare event of the keyboard you're currently on containing a hardware keylogger.
i'd then back that up and keep the backups with family in anti-static bags, maybe with a piece of paper containing hints to your password only you would know.

Gwerks71 is satoshi confirmed
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:06:23
Yeah wouldn't recommend Coinbase. Been a huge ball ache for me. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:50:04
I have used Coinomi in the past and I liked it. Might be what you need. :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:48:41
I highly recommend Coinfloor. Been using them for the better part of a year with no issues what so ever. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:25:30
yeah blockchains wallet has been around awhile and is completely open source. you can buy bitcoin on the wallet using your card, and the fee is only 3% (average fee) but you are limited to £200 daily purchases until your provide ID to the people running that integrated exchange (Coinify)
i only just moved my 3 coins from blockchains wallet, not bad at all dude, its what you make of it. if you have all the security stuff enabled and your pc is clean &amp; your phrases are written down, ur absolutely fine. :) 
if you can get verified on coinfloor you'll be laughing, they're no hassle at all. they even have a no-fee exchange, but it requires a minimum 1k deposit :(. express buy orders have the box standard 3% fee though

@_date: 2017-05-09 23:18:04
i used coinomi and i quite liked its simplicity and it seemed quite secure. i've heard good things about samourai wallet too, looks to have more emphasis on privacy and security:
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:20:32
I've been using Coinfloor for a really long time without any issues, I really couldn't recommend them more. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:18:55
ledger nano s - got mine last week. it's small and sturdy, powers on with a USB cable, and super secure. i love it.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:38:09
thanks guys :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:56:52
no problem, glad i can help =)
The pin is what allows you access to your ledger, so its just as important. :) The 24 recovery words allow you to restore your bitcoins anywhere, if you gave me those words for example, i could restore your coins and take them for myself.
Some wallets are 12 and others are 24, cant remember why that is though!
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:52:47
thank you :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:49:13
yea pretty much, plus the benefit to having a hardware wallet like the ledger is that you can plug it in to a computer riddled with viruses and you'd still be fine with it. if you were to have the btc stored in a web wallet, or a wallet on your computer, you're opened up to way more risks. that ledger will keep your bitcoins are tight. (same goes for other hardware wallets) 
and 
What if I lose my Ledger Wallet?
In case of loss or theft of your Ledger Wallet - or at any time - you can restore your entire balance either
on another Ledger Wallet
or on any BIP39 compatible software wallet such as Multibit HD or Mycelium
thanks to the 24 words you copied on the Recovery sheet. These 24 words are paramount, they are what provides you the ownership of your coins. You must never reveal them, and never loose them.
Without the PIN code (and the second factor card for Nano and HW.1), a thief cannot access your bitcoins. If you have any doubt about compromise of your PIN code and/or second factor card, you should immediately transfer your balance to another wallet.
(  )
What if Ledger goes out of business?
If Ledger shuts down all its activities, the Ledger Chrome app will most probably stop to function as our API servers would be stopped. However, this would only be an inconvenience, as your bitcoins would stay completely safe.
With your recovery sheet, and your 24 words, you can any time restore your balance to another BIP39 compatible wallet.

bitpay i think?
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:59:36
wonder if they'll give us a bitcoin each?
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:15:45
ahhh i didn't know :( best of luck anyways=)
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:51:54
i'm sorry but im not entirely sure because i've never used it. all i know is electrum is highly spoken of in the community. :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:29:01
ledger B)
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:33:59
I'd recommend Keepass instead :)
(offline password manager)
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:17:25
lol isn't exodus closed source?
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:39:32
i'd recommend using electrum, regardless of aug 1. wouldn't hurt to branch out to a hardware wallet if you have the £ spare.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:34:34
Where are you from by the way?
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:56:58
cant wait for this :))
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:14:26
i personally use a ledger and cant think of anything bad to say about it, i really like it. i keep both litecoin and bitcoin on it and i've had no problem. i like the size and sturdiness of it, its not so different from a usb. doesn't feel flimsy at all. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:27:23
coinfloor is a really good exchange. never once had a problem with them. good luck
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:54:49
if i were you i'd buy directly from blockchain.info's wallet, you dont need ID or anything else and you can pay using a debit card, you are limited to £200/daily without ID but you could buy £200 today and £100 tomorrow. thats what i did when i needed to buy fast. just register a wallet with them and you can buy straight away; they also only charge a 3% fee, which is average. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:24:50
i might be wrong though
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:24:29
yeah, coinfloor will be fine for you. i think the minimum amount you can buy is £20 or £30 though. i think its £30.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:16:02
blockchain.info's wallet has a built in service that allows you to buy £200 bitcoin daily with a 3% fee
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:58:48
where are you from?
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:48:39
coinbase or gemini. i personally recommend gemini since its highly spoken of. coinbase never seems to work for me when i want to buy. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:18:51
could try purchase directly from blockchain.info's wallet, you are limited to £200/daily but the fees are respectable at 3%.  no id requried
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:27:05
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:09:13
Yeah, when you buy Bitcoin through the standard express buy, the amount bitcoin was worth at the time you clicked purchase will be locked in for 30 minutes, if you leave it for more than 30 minutes the trade will expire. And yeah you buy through a bank transfer. 
Which bank are you with by the way?
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:04:55
Coinfloor are really good, I have used them a lot in the past. Hard to find anything bad said about them. They only deal in Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:25:54
can i have 1
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:25:58
Thank you as well!
