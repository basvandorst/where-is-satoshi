Shit. I am waiting for a sepa withdrawal from that site.
Luckily it's not a big amount of money, but there's a huge amount of other people money there.

dude, you tipped $13,000? or am i missing something here?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:07:08
too bad i only have 1 upvote to give

it depends on the country you live in. I know that the thing is pretty straightforward for americans (at least based on what i read here) but for example we Italians have basically no clue about how to pay taxes on bitcoin gains.

i get it, being able to give without a second thought must be the best thing about being filthy rich, the worst thing is that if you do that, shitty people are going to surround you in no time.
maybe the tipping system would benefit from anonymity?

"cool, it's low, i'm gonna buy some in a while"
"fuckfuckfuck it's rising, better buy now"
"shitshitshit it was a peak and now it's falling, better sell before it's too late!"
"well, better sell my laptop to pay the rent."

PROTIP: take any advice with a grain of salt.

Yeah, but you also don't know how much the guy is risking.
Plus, this Simon guy has been "missing" for a few days at least, as far as i understand, and people had been complaining about disservices for days (see the guy in this thread who's been waiting for a wire transfer for 10+ days). 
A public statement from him would be HIGHLY appreciated. I understand that he is probably a good guy and that the pressure must have been (and still is) huge in the last few days, but still.

english is my second language and i mix british and american spelling all the time.
Mostly because i have absolutely no idea about what is british and what is american in the first place, except perhaps for color vs. colour.

sold and bought again. at first it went kinda bad and i messed it up, then it went pretty good, but then i messed it up a little bit again.
Right now i'm doing decently, i bought low, i got more coins than ever before, but if and when the rollercoaster decides to stop for a while i'm going to sell something to cash out the initial investment and go long with the rest.

The recent peak most probably was.
This doesn't mean that bitcoin itself is going to die or become worthless in no time, it just mean that in the short therm it's value is going to settle at a value well below the peaks we saw a few days ago.
I think it's probably going to continue with this rollercoaster for a while, but then it's going to continue with the growth trend it had before (maybe even some more than that, i think some of the new people are going to stay, like me). 
If we take the dotcom bubble as an example: not everything went to shit. Take amazon, for example, it dropped to the floor along with the other stocks, but it's still here going strong. It was overvalued at the time, but it wasn't devoid of value.
If you take a look at the charts, and ignore what happened this month, you can see that a price between $100-$130 it's very plausible. What we need right now is for things to settle down a bit; also we need exchanges to roll up their sleeves and learn from what happened in the past few days.
I had to sell most of my bitcoins, because i couldn't afford to loose those money, but i can guarantee that i'm gonna stay here and contribute. I'm a freelance web developer, i'm going to spend the following months looking for ways to contribute with some work, and i'm going to start accepting bitcoin as soon as humanly possible. And i'm going to cash out as little as possible what i'll earn through this. I'm still sorting things out (as i said i'm one of the noob speculators that arrived here recently) but i'm quite sure about the long term potential of crypto currencies and i'm going to do what i can to contribute to their success.
edit: added a couple things
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:16:34
There's no contradiction. it all depends on when you bought and what kind of money you used to buy.
In fact, i can still tell you to buy and hold (maybe try to avoid buying just after it spiked, just saying) while telling you to don't do stupid things like taking loans to buy coins hoping to get super rich in no time.
So, guys: buy low and hold, but don't use money you can't afford to loose.
