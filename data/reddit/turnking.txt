There was a post not long ago about how most of the core bitcoin developers are all on the same external payroll... let me find it.
[Here it is](
In essence, there are very large, moneyed interests attempting to control the bitcoin dev system.  These large, wealthy, interests also, clearly, do not completely understand the crypto ecosystem.
So they've got most of the core dev team, but it's the miners who run things.  So I'm not too worried long-term about how this'll pan out, still, the thought of a centralized (((banking))) power managing the core dev team kind of irks me.
Blockstream is the name of the company created in order to manage the bitcoin core devs, and the only insular group with that much wealth, power, and financial acumen is well documented as being the jewish high financiers parasitizing the rest of the global economy.
Just like some of their other ventures, however, they don't fully understand the market forces they're attempting to command, so, while I doubt that BTC will fall apart, BCH is a very good hedge which is a bit truer to satoshi's vision.
Now that BTC *is* controlled by certain semitic interests, (((they))) will feel a lot more comfortable dumping money into it, so expect to see continued rise in value, and global adoption.
They'll attempt to subvert it, but this network is going to be a hell of a slog to try and subvert.

They're willing pulitzers for making up fake news, not for quality journalism.  Many of these awards are just as corrupt as the publications they're given to.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:14:43
Just as those with now-how are quietly removing their BTC from coinbase into their own wallets to wait for the USAF to happen.

You stand to make a tidy profit if you don't wait, and you stand to lose a lot if you sell the wrong one.

Investigate the background before you buy, mate. ETH was premined.

It's WaPo they're among the least credible of all journalist outlets. They ran the 'pewdiepie is hitler' story for gods sakes.

It will probably continue dropping until 1 week after Aug. first.

Trump is the ideal candidate for us (the people) but terrible for high financiers... they're terrified because he's a populist, he's a good deal maker, and he's not beholden to the Legacy media. He may well put some bankers in the gallows to the ruckus cheers of the American public.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:25:08
... did you live through 2007?
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:23:07
Dude, I have no idea how you went from 'hitler' to 'USSR'.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:10:52
That's what the high financiers are afraid of. Trump is a salesman, and not beholden to the media, if shit goes pear-shaped he'll hop on youtube and twitter and say;


... and he'd get waves of support from across the nation.  
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:33:59
Liberals have no idea what's coming. At least you're here investing in crypto, you have a rough idea that something is coming giving you a leg up on most people.

... Implying hitler did anything wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:03:20
We are. The thing is that he scares them, and he has the power to end them. That's something bankers haven't been faced with in a very long time.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:27:32
My main concern is; in the event of a hard fork, how will relative price points work?
Do you think exchanges will just manage the fork, and pin the initial price point for each on the former bitcoin point? or will the segwit fork start from 0?
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:54:18
It took me no more than 20 minutes. Try are horrible indeed.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:01:16
Do I have to spell it out for you? It's not the attempted invasion of sociopathic muslim soldiers, rapists, and violent human garbage that concerns me... it's the jewish bankers who support it.
I love being a conservative in the united states, Libs can whine and gnash their teeth all day. We're sitting here with a hundred thousand rounds, fifty thousand in BTC, and twenty thousand in gold... waiting.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:01:43
Top kek mate. Tell me more about how Trump is a communist.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:46:39
That's the impression I've been getting, like every one else, I'd like to avoid a hard fork... but I also recognize that miners will be as difficult to herd as cats.
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:12:13
We'd be looking at half the global market at best... but... we can also expect that half of all bitcoins will be lost.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:11:38
So is that a 'ready' or is it a 'prepared' ?
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:27:21
Hasn't coinbase discussed this already, in so far as providing options for both post-fork currencies?
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:11:28

I don't know when the crash will occur. They can't raise interest rates much more, and they can't lower them past zero. The 'elites' however do not want a crash when Trump is the president of the largest economy on earth... so I expect this crash to be pushed back as long as it can.
