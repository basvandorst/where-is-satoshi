Go where? Where are you going to go when the banking system collapses and you can't pump gas or buy food? Is everyone going to start accepting bitcoin? I believe in bitcoin but this scenario sounds very bizarre

Its money base has been devalued for months now

It's the revenge of the shorts

I wonder if that guy is rich now... or still holding

Right there with you. This is a blast. Even the dark times 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:21:53
I do see a lot of parallels from what forums I've read myself
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:24:36
I'm just saying. I like a lot of your posts

Pretty sure they stopped because bitcoins value has been plummeting and they're not interested in funneling their profit into highly speculative gambles. I believe in bitcoin but if I had a business I wouldn't accept it as payment just yet. These businesses have a lot of expenses

Because we use dollars

This is exactly what a bear market is. You might be right, but based on past performance (which I know doesn't prove anything,  but it's the best we have), things will turn around. Will BTC ever moon again? I dont know, but I highly doubt this is the new ATH. Just hold on to it and go about your life. Pretend like the money is gone and put some money in index funds for a while. Don't panic sell. I think you're likely to regret it if you do.

That's what you get for trying to time the market
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:14:22
Like you were there
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:15:01
Lol clowns like you sound just as dumb as the fanatics. Like you or they actually know. Quit speaking with so much confidence

So the benefit is that you could travel with it, but you wouldn't travel? 
Why do you think people who just lost all their net worth are going to give a shit about bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-27 23:56:33
Wow, you've made a great case here. Adoption is certain with salespeople like you
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:57:12
It's in a downturn. The price is dropping. You're not clairvoyant. You do not know what's going to happen any more than the holders do, you cynical, arrogant ass

Thanks finance expert from the future

Just bought my first bitcoin. Fuck it. I'm putting 5% of all my income into bitcoin until 2020. Will revisit then. Maybe I missed the boat and it's all downhill. My 5% is money I'd happily lose to avoid FOMO. This whole wave is a lot of fun and it will be cool to say I was a part of it. Fuck you to the smug naysayers. I'm sure there were plenty like you throughout the last 6 years or so
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:19:50
Man, so this is what the weak hands look like in real time. Just take a break. Leave your money where it is. That's my opinion, at least.
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:07:01
Hahaha wow what a fool. Learn from your stupid choices
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:23:21
Did you sell?
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:59:26
How is bitcoin going to help you in this situation? Serious question.  Who is going to trade your bitcoin for anything when the entire society has descended into madness
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:08:07
I'm a holder, and your posts just seem so pathologically optimistic and self assuring. It makes me sad and the apparent desperation in your posts probably drives people to sell.
