I hope you all behaved well.

So, better we stop doing transactions, then the chain stays the same size?
@_date: 2016-03-01 10:34:05
I guess you are the only person who knows that for sure?
You should really switch to stock markets.

So your argument is: "Ethereum will have problems because it has a low market cap?"
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:21:37
Doesn't matter. Even then I pay a fixed price for whatever transactions I execute.

Bitcoin is at its core a money transfering network. If there are suddenly fees they attack a core principle.
It's like if western unions were free, and then becomes the thing we all know what it is.
Ethereum is not "just a cheaper western union". Ethereum is a mechanism which makes sure, that your contractor keeps his promises. Transfering money is just a part of it.

No, it won't. The GAS price would just go up. There wouldn't even be a discussion. GAS is part of ethereums core mechanisms, hence there is no ethereum without GAS.
Ethereum has an inherently built in fee market.

If you are altering this visualization, I have a suggestion to improve its usefulness.
Add a feature which maps the opacity of the dots to the size of the transaction/input/output. 
So its easier to see the bigger clusters and making sense of it.

Its ready in the sense that it works. The current hashrate is [500Gh/s]( and hence an equivalence of 20000 good GPUs are mining.
You can program your contract and feed it into the blockchain. All miners ensure that this code is actually executed correctly.

In fact there are multiple ones.
However, the ethereum system is more like a programing language, and hence the regular clients are more like development tools.
* There is 'alethzero' which is pretty useful for debugging
* There is 'geth' which is the bitcoin-core equivalent. It's the thing you run if you mine or if you run a full-node.
* And there are clients written in other languages like java
* There are light clients like electrum, but completely decentralized

GPU mining is not only available, its more or less necessary. CPU's just stand a chance.

Private Blockchains don't make much sense in any case. 
I think they want to test smart contracts on a private blockchain (hence the support of them) but deploy these contracts on the public one. However, this public chain is not necessary the one which is currently mined on with ethereum.

The only thing you can be sure is, that the BTC-wallet gets empty. But they might just have converted it to € or $.

The network might be less important as you think.
In a PoW system the pure hashpower is important, of course. 
But ethereum plans to switch to PoS system where you don't need big clusters.

There are plenty of recourses out there, which explain what ethereum is and what does it best (Bi/multi-directional enforcement of arbitrary agreements) 
There are also plenty of resources out there, which explain what ethereum is not, and which task can't be solved. (e.g. Ethereum is not a currency, it just contains a currency)
So, if you want to get your facts straight start at the [ethereum blog](

Of course, but not only to Bitcoin but also to other non bitcoin blockchains with other strengths.

MS doesn't even provide a wallet for end users.
MS just puts the bitcoin-core equivalent "geth" into the azure cloud and made it accessible to developers which then use the MS-Cloud.
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:54:18
They wan't to provide good tools for mining and developing, so that even non techy people are able to mine from the beginning.  
This prevents a few early adopters from gaining huge amounts of ether, which will be important while they switch from PoW to PoS. 
If you wan't to test your miner, you can do it already. You just need to write your own (CUDA)code.

Of course it will start as a 'small' and therefore more centraliced system with all the downsides. But, if it's a good system and if it provides real benefits, it will grow. Just like bitcoin in 2011. 
PoS is centralized at the beginning, and stays centralized if the user adoption doesn't grow. But if the userbase grows PoS gets less centralized. There is a nice analysis somewhere, which explains this fact in detail, but I currently can't find it. I may eddit this post with a link.

He didn't say anything about liklihood.
Coins simply evolve. For long times the fitness of some coin looks great, until a new one appears. I don't say it will happen, but it could!
Therefore, thinking that bitcoin will be the best anytime, because it's the best now is kind of ... doltish

Forking Ethereum is a way of saying, I don't like the way the system is maintained by the ethereum foundation.
So by forking it, users say "you are fired".
But you are right, a fork is a major risk for the team around vitalik. So they have an incentive to create a good system, where lots of people benefit from it.

As far as i know, there was a recent paper, which showed that you can track TOR users down if they use bitcoin at the same time. 
Wouldn't this be bad for tails?

@_date: 2015-02-25 11:38:44
I think the problem is that TOR gets insecure through bitcoin. This would render TAILS useless. 
But I don't have enough knowledge about that.

As the process of generating accounts has no costs at all, how can you protect the system from beeing spammed by a someone who creates millions and millions accounts?
It may be possible that i havn't understood the system, so this question could be meaningles.
