another person using this subreddit, not to talk about bitcoin (which is what we should be talking about) but for you to personally insult me.
please, stop with the personal insults (and crazy conspiracy theories about other accounts, too �� �� ��).  I'm mean, seriously, enough is enough!
if you want to talk about bitcoin, thats cool
but if you just want to call me names and personally insult me, i would politely ask you to refrain from commenting.
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:13:46
what's a ��?
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:39:43


its both
just the same as gold or certain other assets
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:21:17
basically, there will be about 5 more days or bitcoin price going up, up, up (my guess is up to about 14K)
then we're gonna crash, probably go down 30%, stay down a least a month
after that, who knows, but probably a slow increase over the Summer
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:54:58
it does to some people
i am one of those people
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:17:49
oh, i hope i am wrong, too
personally, I'd love it to go up in price
sadly, i think it will go down another 25% in the next month is my prediction
but i guess we'll just have to wait and see
best to you in all your bitcoin investing!
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:40:59


this part is true
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:40:27
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:12:18
thats what i'm talking about
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:08:22
ok, i will try that
its not working today
i mean, if i called my bank and their phones were totally down, and i couldn't get a hold of a human during weekday business hours, i'd be worried
but i guess with coinbase, thats just normal.
oh well... i guess thats the level or rinky-dink amateur hour we are dealing with over at coin base
thanks again, and yes... i will try them later!
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:00:43
Rest In Peace BTC
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:25:22
oh sure, you want my prediction?
no prob.
what's happening today is a something called a "dead cat bounce" 
price will go up a little (maybe for 24 hours?)
then come back down to where it was before, and even go a little lower
as i said all along... price is trending down (but even as it goes down, it might have little, temporary, upward spikes along the way)
within a few days, it will be even lower.  guaranteed.
after all, if there is one thing thats almost always true, its that my predictions come true.
anyway, my advice, don't buy today, as the price is still trending down, and anything you buy today will be worth even less in a week.
Thats whats going to happen,  If you wish to use this advice to guide your decisions, feel free (and if you do, you'll thank me, for sure).
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:06:57
good joke
sadly, it will be closer to 8K in september, and then stay there a long time
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:03:00
makes sense
good for you with the schools
here in the USA, some of the schools are privately owned, and those schools are really just there to make themselves as much money as they can.
these private schools charge 40-50K per year in tuition, and then they use lobbyists to bribe politicians to give students loans for these way-overpriced diploma factories.
Generally speaking, anyone in the USA who goes to one of these over-priced private schools is an idiot.
People who go to these schools do so for the status, being able to say "i went to harvard" is like wearing Gucci or Prada clothes, to them.
They don't learn any more than someone at an affordable school, but they prefer the designer label colleges.
Anyway, good luck in your studies!
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:19:12
there will be a hard crash within the next 5 days
if this bull trap run is still going on in 3 days, that would be a good time to sell.
then when the crash hits (it will be about a 30% drop) then quickly buy up what you sold, plus some.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:54:04
its not over yet
its still going down hard
no brakes!
we are going to hit 7k soon (then it will level off)
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:34:43

one of those egg heads that has youtube videos or give speeches about the "future of bitcoin"
sorry, but the "experts" and the eggheads are the most wrong of all.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:27:31
ignore the haters
you called it
you deserve a pat on the back
as it is, you'll have to just settle for my upvote
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:26:21
i am not a day trader, 
besides, i already know enough to not take any financial advice from people on here
its when people listen to 'experts" that they lose money
when they listen to their intuition, they do just fine.  my intuition says not to day trade or short
my intuition says buy no more bitcoin
and my intuition says to just hodl
so, i will listen to my intuition, and never will i listen to an "expert" like you
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:24:24
on the other hand, you might not be able to buy bitcoin at the price he paid
but you can always make a new kid.
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:30:25


and 


and there you go folks.
i talk about bitcoin, and this guy results to being nasty.
sorry, not falling for it.
go troll somewhere else.
if you want to talk about bitcoin, thats cool (I'm all ears)
but when you start talking trash, or being rude, thats when you lose me.
bye bye!
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:37:28
of course
i will always admit i am wrong, if that happens
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:03:46
well, i am guessing right, every.single.time this month, every.single.time
call it what you will, but you can't argue with success in predicting/guesing or call it what you will
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:53:22
how can i find a copy of this video to share?
i mean, just the video?
does anybody know?
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:42:55
oh shit
its crashing down EVEN harder now
down 6% more from where it was this afternoon (which was already low)
this sucks big time.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:27:12
i didnt
i remain detached and accurate, by not buying
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:46:10
i am certain that price will go down a little, but mainly that price will stagnate another year, at least
so, i have long ago decided to HODL, which is what i will do
its a long shot, but i am talking a gamble that years from now, bitcoin might go up in value.
so, thats what i have said all along (look at my predictions)
i say to others what i do, which is HODL what you have, but do NOT buy any more bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:47:45
i'll see you in your cardboard box in the street next week, buddy
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:55:09
i admit it 100%
i say i am not an expert
and that i rely on my intuition
that's perhaps why i have been so accurate in my predictions
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:20:11
yes, the real money to be made in bitcoin has already happened
but no sense in trying to buy or sell while the whales are manipulating
better to hold what you have (even if its down) than to try to make more money, and in doing so lose even more
just hodl, thats all you can do when the pump n dump whales are controlling the price
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:55:51

i just share my predictions
but follow your own heart is what i say
i never asked for anyone else's trust

I spent MORE $100
How much did YOU spend?
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:29:59
thanks for your comment.
and i'm glad its not just me, and that others have found coinbase to be a totally lame company in regard to their support.
as for me, i have an issue (not end of the world, but important) I have been trying all day to get ahold of them, and cant get through to anyone but recorded messages.
It just makes me think, what if there was a real issue? or someone had hacked my account? or assets were missing? or anything like that, where time was of the essence?
just knowing that no matter what i do, or no matter how severe the situation, that i can not get ahold of them does make me feel they cant be trusted, or at least not relied upon.
besides, if this is how they are in dealing with their customers, can you even begin to imagine what a mess they are behind the scenes?
these guys, who cant even figure out how to answer a phone are supposed to be the ones we trust to protect our crypto assets from the best hackers in the world?
that company (coinbase) seems more and more like a joke, the more i learn about them!
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:12:17
seeing the new-bees makes me laugh, too!
I've been around a while, and i can relate to what you say.
seeing a new-bee talk like they know is funny indeed.
i remember when i was a new-bee, and just starting to learn (this was way back in mid-2017)
since then i have learned so much.
i am not an expert, even now... although am exellent and very accurate at predicting.
but yes... you are correct, watching the new-bees think they are smart is super funny.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:06:57
its a gift
it took a while, but now i can just kind "see" and sense how the market will go
not always, but at certain times, yes
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:45:02
thats not how investing works

@_date: 2019-07-02 21:11:18
bitcoin has a huge future
that is true.
but whether that future is one million
...or zero?
thats what i'm waiting to find out.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:38:33
well, about four days ago i predicted that this latest increase was a bull trap
and that the recent price spike was just due to whales pumping (and that they'd soon be dumping)
hope you all listened, and didnt fall for it, again.
some people they fall for these whale's games every.single.time.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:24:09
if bitcoin went to zero, it would be a huge development, as perhaps the biggest financial disaster in our lifetimes
it would be huge news for decades to come
in some ways, bitcoin going to zero would be even more huge than it going to one million (as bitcoin going to one million has long been predicted by many, but few even think it would ever go to absolute zero)
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:10:45


you don't have to remember, you can simple look at my past predictions, and you will see that i am nearly 100% correct in my predictions
the so called experts however, are wrong all the time
if they experts listened to me, they would be much more correct
oh well...
thats life i guess
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:07:32
well, better safe than sorry
remember, at one point, bitcoin was a shitcoin worth just pennies, that no one (except a very few) thought would go anywhere.
but its always good to buy a little bit of other coins (not a lot, just a little) of coins like ETH, and LTE and even a little XRP and stellar lumens (just in case - as the risk is low, if you only invest a little, and the payout is unlikely, but could possibly be huge - after all, it was the early adopters, even small amounts, that became the lambo bitcoin billionaires)
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:14:16


not just salty, here to help (to remind the new-bees that its not all up up up - and that many of us lost big money on bitcoin)
i am NOT blaming bitcoin for making me homeless, but i will say this... now that i am homeless, i could sure use that money i lost in buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:48:27
yes, that is the goal of every snail
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:35:49
but to be serious... i don't say i "know" it
thats just my prediction (obviously)
nonetheless, i do honestly think it will be a 50% correction
then it will hover there for a while
then a slow decline through the entire summer
in the fall, a mini-rally (but we will still stay well below 10K)
2019 will end with bitcoin around 9000 (or a little lower, maybe 8500 or so)
anyway, thats all i got.
just my opinion, i don't pretend to know anything, just sharing what i feel will happen.
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:33:05


thats all i have done, i have HODL for 18 months
guess what?
i am waaaaaaayyyyy down.
i have been holding, and i am still down negative 40%
i'll hold some more, but honestly, bitcoin has been the worst investment i have ever made.
not sure why me sharing my personal truth bothers you, but for some reason it does.
oh well... perhaps you need to chill a little bit?
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:18:19
no, i will never buy or sell bitcoin again
i learned my lesson
i will just HODL (what i currently have)
one day, i might cash out, but buying and selling, or short term investing, that is beyond my skill set
i know that i am personally not smart enough to time the market!
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:52:20
not really, most companies, especially financial institutions, have real humans with brains, not just email support
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:40:29
you were saying?
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:50:57
last week, i said (several times) don't buy, price was going to crash
and guess what? i got downvoted into oblivion, and told by dozens i was an idiot, and that we were on a solid bull run.
anyway, if any of those people who insulted me throughout the week with to apologize to me...
here i am.
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:51:08
and just like that....
we are heading down again
will we ever get to $20k again?
it doesnt look like it
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:02:41
I can't worry about whether others downvote me, or not
i am not in PR
i just put my accurate predictions out there and anyone who wants to follow them, can do so
and anyone who wants to ignore them, can do that if they choose.
as far as the so-called "experts" (the people you describe as "professional traders with a track record or quoting sources that make their guesses based on TA or news withing the crypto market.")
i might not know everything about bitcoin, but there is one thing i know for sure...
Do NOT listen the "experts".  if you listen to the bitcoin "experts" you will lose your money, that much I can guarantee.
My opinion, is that people should follow their own intuition, and do what feels right to them (as opposed to doing what some "brainiac experts" tell them they should do)
@_date: 2019-07-28 07:13:22


yes, that is correct
thats MY *opinion*
you can listen to it or not.
Its a free country.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:03:05
oh, in that case
can you sell, so that price goes up?
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:30:19
why not? do you know what is the real deal with the space aliens?
if so, might as well share it on here 
i won't tell anyone, i promise.
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:08:02
whales are gonna whale
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:44:39
i already said i was going to HODL
but i guess you cant read
oh well
come back to me when you have a better brain, thanks!
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:22:35
pumpin' n dumpin'
playing the rest of us for suckers
this is why you never buy when price is going up
if you do, you'll just wind up making a whale ever richer.

@_date: 2019-07-19 01:36:40
that what i asked when i walked into the chinese whorehouse
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:28:09
i don't real understand what that means, or even what a base block is
but yes, sounds like its probably the correct answer
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:06:07
well, i gotta admit, i do love this site
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:06:07
Price does matter to some
Smart people care about price
On the other hand, those the whales think of as "useful idiots" are the ones who say "i'm in it for the technology"
the technology?
Not me, pal
I am in it for the ������
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:31:43
yes, after i lost thousands and thousands when bitcoin crashed 80%
excuse me, but i didnt have any extra money lying around to keep on buying
wow, you rich types with consistent extra money to keep on buying did fine
but those of us who are truly poor, got ass raped by bitcoin
i mean, yes... now that i am only negative 30% thats better than when i was negative 80%
but i am not some Marvin Moneybags, with extra money to keep on buying
I purchased over a few months with some money that i could afford to lose
and i lost most of it in the crash.
i don't have even more money to put at risk, so i just lost out
oh well, thats what happened
but hey, you want to insult me?  weird, but ok, have a nice day!
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:43:39


sure, depends when you buy though
people who bought in early 2018 and are still HODLing a year and a half later, have lost 40% of their money
an investment that loses 40% of your money is a terrible investment.
Anyway, bitcoin is so volatile, that it depends upon when you bought it, as to whether its a "good investment"
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:01:30
no, not yet.
there is still a little more dumping to be done by the whales.
there will be a little bit of a dead cat bounce, after this recent drop
when the mini-spike happens, the whales will dump some more.
after that, this round of pump and dump will be over, for a little bit.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:11:32
me neither
i just wake up, turn on my uber driver app, then pick up passengers all day
i only make about $12/hour
but i dont think about it, i just drive, and whatever money is deposited into my bank account i spend
then i wake up and do it all over again
but how the economy works? i have no idea
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:31:44
i will do neither
i will not short
nor will i stop sharing my helpful and accurate predictions
you are not the king of this subreddit, you dont get to decide who shares, and what they say.
All are free to politely share opinions, whether or not the are shorting bitcoin, or not.
seriously, relax
no need to be so dour, you silly goose!
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:28:41
yes, thats one of the bars i set
but to you, i guess its fine that welfare people just don't do any work at all, and just lay about on your tax money
you're fine with that, but you insult a job that i have, as a working man
ok, cool
got it
i see what youre about.
well, good luck to you
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:06:56


i actually bought over a period of a couple of months
and now, 18 months later, i am down -40%
i didnt buy all at once, and i am waaaaaaay down.
on the other hand, with my other extra money, i bought stocks, and have made many thousands of dollars.
just sharing my experience, and in my experience, i love all the money i make from stocks, but bitcoin? its been a total money loser (for me).
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:23:27
wow, me having a different opinion than you really gets you into insult mode, huh?
that (to me) is weird
but hey, if being personally insulting is your jam, go for it!
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:24:29


i never asked anyone to invest on anything
i simply stated my prediction, and said "do what you want"
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:01:45
see, this is what i was talking about
whenever someone (in this case me) makes a bearish prediction about bitcoin, there are always duded like this user who will get their panties all in a bunch and start personally insulting.
on the other hand, if someone makes a positive prediction about bitcoin, guys like this are all like "to the moon, bro"
seriously, if you don't agree with my near-perfect predictions, thats cool, its free world
but no need to get all worked up
relax bro, its just an online chat forum, not the UN
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:11:29
yes, thank you (good that you reminded people of that).
i got the number from their website.
here's the official number from coinbase.com (in case anyone wants the real one).
of course, don't take my word for it, go and check for yourself, obviously!
Not that calling it will do any good, its just a bunch of unhelpful pre-recorded messages, all basically telling you to submit a support ticket online.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:02:39
i thought you were such an expert?
seriously, you claim price is going up one minute, 2 minutes later you recommend selling
i had already decided to HODL a long time ago, so thats what i am going to keep on doing
but youre change-every-5-minutes investing advice is hilarious
thanks for the laugh, and hey... just a suggestion, you might want to make up your mind.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:32:16
its actually correct
just like my prediction yesterday (as it started to go up) when i said to people on here, don't buy
as its just gonna go down.
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:37:50


i am going to hold, but honestly... in 2-5 years, i think bitcoin will be down to 7k, or less
and will be replaced by much better, or corporate backed cyrptos like libra
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:12:48
i have heard lots of people tell me, just HODL, and bitcoin will make you money
i mean, i HOPE you are correct.
but at this point, i just look at the numbers.
the numbers say that i am in the hole, and have lost money.
but hey... if i am EVER in positive territory with bitcoin, i will be happy to admit i was wrong about bitcoin, and others like you were correct in telling me to HODL
but for now, FOR ME, its been the worst investment i ever bought (thus far).
so, i guess we'll just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:28:25


lately, its just whales pumping and dumping thats effecting the price
thats about the only real factor
it will go down to $8k pretty soon though, and there will be some mini pump n dumps, but mainly its just gonna stagnate until mid/late 2020 after it hits $8K
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:44:55
well, youre listening
so thats a start
see you laterz!
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:58:11
than k you for making my apooint
you are so totally into me
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:43:07
but i do
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:20:01
yes, i was the sucker ripe for the picking.  the pump and dump whales definitely made their money off of me!
and yes, before buying, i did do my research, and read books, watched the experts give lectures on youtube, etc.
the near-universal consensus in late 2017 (when i got into it) was that bitcoin was going to keep going up until at least 40k, and might even go to 100k
so, with all the experts saying that late 2017 was a great time to buy, i started buying little bits in nov 2017, and then with my money growing each day, and all the experts saying to buy, i bought even more with each new week, 
things were looking great, then the HUGE crash came, but all the experts were saying, "its an even *better* time to buy, BUY THE DIP" so i kept buying well into jan 2018.
eventually (maybe by mid to late jan 2018) i was like, what? these "experts" don't know shit.  they are all clueless idiots.  so i stopped buying any new bitcoin.
but, i figured, i would just HODL what i had already bought.  I wound up at negative 80% of what i bought.  Now, it still sucks, with me being at negative 40% of what i spent.
i have written that money off as lost, and i don't expect to ever make my money back.
Bitcoin was the worst investment of my life, but oh well.... we win some, we lose some.
time for me to just move on from this shitty investment (shitty to me, anyway, i know others did make money from it)
yes, i will hold what i already own, but i will NEVER buy bitcoin again.  its been such a shitty and terrible experience on every level, i never want to go through anything like that again!
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:11:14
thats what yo momma said
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:24:38


sure, you can say that, but i am telling you what my prediction is
my prediction is that bitcoin will continue to go down in price, even more, this week.
my guess is down to 7k, although it might stick at 8K for a bit, and THEN go down to 7k.
i didnt say i knew, in the scientific sense, i am just putting my prediction (which tend to be very accurate) out there.
i guess we'l just wait and see if i am correct (like i always am) or whether you are correct?
only the future will tell.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:08:31


because i believe in an investing rule that says only invest in bitcoin what you can afford to lose
and right now, i have no extra money that i can afford to lose
as such, i won't invest right now.
although... thats all i will say for now.  as for as what or how much i would ever invest, or exactly when i personally invest, you want me to start sharing private financial investing choices with strangers on the internet?
no, i will just speak in vague terms with my predictions, i will not share how much i own, or of what, or anything like that.
to start sharing publicly how much bitcoin you have or when you are buying it, etc, is foolish.
people need to keep that sort of info private, and not just share it willy nilly
i am surprised you didn't know that!
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:35:33
sure, you keep bring up the past
but i already mentioned that i listened to the experts, and then following their advice bought in 2017 and 2018 
(not in one buy, as you dishonestly claim by the way, but i bought in varying amounts, starting with small buys in sept or october of 2017, then also buying through november 2017 multiple times, december 2017 multiple times, and January 2018 multiple times, in different amounts each time. after buying for 5 months, i saw i was down 20-30% so i figured i would wait and see.  Wound up being down even more, so good thing i stopped buying when i did.  i wound up down nearly 80% down at the worst.  now, approaching two years later, i am STILL down 25% or so.  So, instead of making 20% profit (which i would have, had i put it into a Vanguard fund, or something similar) i am down negative 25%. 
Anyway, thats what happens when i listened to the 'experts" and those who said to buy, that bitcoin was a money-maker (and yes, for early adopters and for *some* it has been.  but for me, and thousands and thousands like me, its been a HUGE money loser.  )
since then, i have learned.  I don't listen to outside "experts"  I just hold, and listen to my internal intuition.
now, since i don't buy at all, i am emotionally detached, and have been amazingly accurate at predicting
of course, whether you listen or not, is up to you.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:10:17
no need to stress
price is gonna keep dropping, might as well wait until it hits 8K before buying, 
as it will keep crashing, in my opinion, all the way down to 7K
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:30:04


yes, and you will soon see how great a prediction that was
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:16:50


well, obviously if you did not have wonderful near-perfect predictions (like i have) that could easily be documented in my past comments, then how could you tell that to others?
only i can make the claim, as only i have the near-perfect predictions
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:11:04
oh, i hope you do better than me
i LOST a shit ton of money buying bitcoin, hope you do better than me, friend
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:40:03
i see general trends
but i don't know on any one day what the price will be
but in october 2019, the price will be between 6-10k (thats about as specific as i can get at this point)
@_date: 2019-07-26 03:47:06
wow, you must be fun at parties
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:53:54
yes, that is my advice to others as well, do not be a sucker
and hey, if you made so much from bitcoin investing, feel free to share one of those bitcoins with me, if you want to!
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:08:10
maybe i did, but i am not sure what you are talking about
i didn't say that this week, at least not in my memory
i did say that, this week, it was not going to be great, even though others were predicting bull run
i correctly called it as a classic bull trap (which it was)
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:43:19
no, you clearly don't know how real investing works
you say things like "buy the dip"
wow, much smart!
thats like someone claiming to be a wall street investor saying "buy low, sell high"
its not that easy, mr know it all.
seriously, if you say to me "sell" i will HODL (which is what i was going to do anyway)
bitcoin is still a money loser, but i might as well wait and see, maybe one day???
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:55:37
that has nothing to do with bitcoin
just join a no fee bank like USAA
or... just join a credit union and do your banking there (as most credit unions do not charge fees like that)
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:03:40
no, by no longer buying (and just HODLing only) i am able to be detached
which is why i am able to predict so incredibly accurately.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:34:40


yup, i am one of those
I am HODLing, but i'll never like bitcoin again, at least not until i break even
right now, i am 40% negative in the hole!
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:17:14
yes, good point.  sadly coinbase doesnt even have working chat bots!
on the other hand, one of my banks is HSBC and the other (my local bank in the USA) is Chase.
between the two of them, they have MILLIONS MORE customers than coinbase.
but i can get a hold of a human being 24/7 with either of them. (even some college kid with $2.34 in their checking account can call their bank and talk to a human being)
And its not just banks/financial institutions, even with Amazon, if a package is missing, no matter how small, i can call and talk to them 24/7
just about every company i deal with, on any level, has a human in can talk to (if need be).
coinbase wants to pretend like they are a real company, but in reality its just rinky-dink amateur hour over there, and they don't even have a telephone that works.
Anyway, i didnt want to disagree with anyone on there, i was just posting this as a warning.
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:07:57


thats what people keep saying
might be true
i HOPE you're right!
but i've been holding for 18 months and i'm still in negative territory
i guess, once i make a profit, anything, even one penny, i'll start believing those who say its coming back up.
@_date: 2019-07-26 03:46:25
that's not what u/woodles says
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:41:00
the whales are just trying to do some last minute pump and dumps before it goes down to $8k, which it will do pretty soon
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:06:17
instead of making a better system, that everyone can use
this replier makes fun of the new person who got zapped by the insane fees
how about we get rid of the fees?
that would be better than insulting people who try to use bitcoin for the first time and get screwed over with high fees
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:19:51
yes, thats what i have been saying for a couple of weeks now
down to 8K (it might temporarily go down as low as $6k - but it won't go down to 4K or 5K)
then its gonna be a loooooooong year, while it hovers around 8k for at least 12 months
it won't really bounce back in any meaningful way until mid/late 2020
@_date: 2019-07-12 09:17:16
no, i predicted that this last spike, and subsequent fall was whales pumping and dumping
i was right.
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:46:38
what's a mouse trap?
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:34:24


do you know math bro?
going from 20K to 3K is more than 50%
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:10:01
 &gt;I know bitcoin is being a real bitch right now
 
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:03:26
I told people not to buy yet, that the whales were still pumping and dumping
And rough seas were ahead for a bit.
For saying that, I got downvoted into oblivion.
All those who downvoted me yesterday, I guess you’re feeling kinda foolish today, huh?
No worries.
But listen to me now...
More rough seas ahead, do not buy yet, repeat do not buy yet.
@_date: 2019-07-31 03:39:00
This is just a reminder of my predictions.  But just so you know, my predictions are totally correct, although... I will say, I don't pretend to be an expert.
I just predict/have a sense of the market, based on my *feelings*.
Thats what I tell others too.  Ignore the experts and let your feelings be your guide.  If you can't trust your own intuition, who can you trust? (is what i say).
Anyway... with that disclaimer out of the way, i just wanted to let everyone know to NOT get caught up in the price rise today. (after all, its "follow your feelings" NOT "follow your emotions")
Yes, price is going up today a little, but its just a bit of a dead cat bounce (we are still in a downward trend).
Remember what i have been predicting all along, that within a couple of weeks btc price will be down to $8k.
So, if you buy now, you will lose money, as its just going to (overall) just head down to $8k within the next week or two.
Also, just to remind everyone, my prediction also says that once it hits about $8k, it will just stay there for a long time (or near to that price for a long time) It will stagnate around $8k for about a year.
In mid/late 2020 it will start to rise up again.
Don't buy now (its just going to stagnate).
You *could* sell, but why? you won't make that much.
Best recommendation from me, just HODL what you have, don't buy any now (but buy some more if you wish ONCE IT HITS $8K)
Mainly, just HODL for at least a year, and more likely you'll have to hold for 2 years, at least, if you want to make a profit.
OK, that's all i got for now, invest safely, wisely, and remember my motto... when it comes to bitcoin, NEVER listen to the "experts" and ALWAYS follow your own feelings instead!
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:40:52
 
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:00:36
i have said this many times (i did listen to the "experts" and bought over a several months in late 2017 and early 2018)
obviously, that was a real money loser.
after that, i realized that the crypto/bitcoin experts knew nothing, and i resolved to never listen to any of the bitcoin "experts" ever again.
Once i totally stopped listening to them, i noticed that my own intuition was near-perfect.
so, i started sharing my intuition and predictions on here.  For nearly a year, just about every thing i have predicted has wouldn't up being true.
but hey... thats just me.  I trust my own intuition, its up to you and others if your intuition tells you to do as i predict?
thats up to you!
@_date: 2019-07-28 01:03:17
yeah right!
more like...
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:30:49
ok, well i don't care about anything anymore
a beta that don't give a fuck about anything, that can be dangerous
but hey, if you want to meet in a parking lot, and "talk it out" LMK
i'll be there, and then we'll see who will win, crazy don't care about anything any more "beta" or big talking nfam
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:09:17
oh, youre the one who gets to decide who should be allowed to share their opinions on bitcoin, on here?  and which comments are valid or worthy enough to be posted on here?
i had no idea. 
my apologies, your majesty, i did not know i was talking to the king of bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:24:17
oh, day traders
those guys are the ones being most manipulated by the pump n dump whales
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:04:01
a few days ago, when the price was going up and around $11K, i was attacked and downvoted into oblivion for saying it was only a temporary spike (dead cat bounce)
and i had pointed out that within about 2-4 weeks bitcoin would be down to $8k.
i was told (by many on here) that i was delusional, and that i dint know what i was talking about.
hmmm, how'd my prediction turn out thus far?
It does now seem that in just a few days, we are halfway there.
Will we hit $8K right away?  
I doubt it, but within a couple of weeks (more or less), sure... we will (like i said all along).
Anyway, i did previously point out how it would be dropping so that people would know not to buy (as its generally not a good idea to buy while the price is falling).
I just wanted to come back on here to remind everyone, it is still not a good time to buy, as the price will still be dropping some more (all the way down to $8K).  Just sit back and relax for the moment.
Once it hits $8K, you can buy if you want to.  But only buy it if you plan to HODL, as once it hits $8K its just gonna stagnate there for some time (at least until well into 2020).
Anyway, follow your own intuition, and do whatever feels right to you (obviously).
Personally, my intuition has been incredibly accurate (ever since i started listening to what my gut told me, which was something i started doing about a year ago).  Other people that listened to my advice/predictions have done quite well.  So you all *might* want to consider listening to me this time.
Oh, and for all those who were attacking and downvoting me into oblivion last week, if you want to apologize to me now, I am wiling to accept any apologies that you offer me.
Remember, follow your own heart, and do what YOU feel is best.  My intuition has been totally accurate, but still... its your own intuition that you need to learn to listen to.
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:07:37
the "$" goes *in front of the numbers*, not behind!

@_date: 2019-07-13 20:44:34
stay away
this is just whale time.
everyone else, stay far, far away!
i'll let you know when its safe to go back in the water (it will be at least a week, though).
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:34:05
i hope youre right
i'll actually believe the hype if i ever make ANY money from it, even one penny would be a start
i hope youre right, but the numbers (me actually making a profit, of any sort) will be the real proof to me.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:26:40
in the last year, I've only made correct calls
I am not sure why i have this gift of accurate predicting, but i do
Oh well... hope others can benefit!
@_date: 2019-07-24 07:57:30
and yet, i still am more correct than all these so-called "experts"
kinda make you wonder about these experts after all
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:36:24
no, i don't trade
especially now.
My advice to others is to NOT buy any more bitcoin (which is exactly what i am doing myself)
price is going down, down, down (is my prediction)
then it will stay low at around 8K for about a year (another one of my predictions)
after that it will slowly rise, a little bit.
so, seriously, if this what my predictions are, why would i buy more bitcoin?
i can make at least 8% every year on my vanguard growth fund account.  
so, thats where i would invest any extra money, if i have any.
Not in bitcoin, which i predict will go down and then stagnate for at least the next year
i mean, you know what my predictions are, but then you critique me for not buying more bitcoin?
Do you even think before you type your comments?
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:36:43
thats what people like you on here told me a year and a half ago
i believed you all, and bought a bunch
now, 18 months later, i have lost 40% of the money i put into bitcoin.
hey, you might be right, but based on my actual real life experience, please excuse me if i remain skeptical.
talk is cheap, i will believe its a good investment when it actually makes me money (as opposed to just losing me thousands and thousands of dollars).
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:08:45


being rude to a poor person
wow, so brave!
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:53:46


i disagree
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:14:48
on the current market, i am definitely a bear, 
as the price will slowly go down (with a few little spikes along the way) for the next month or so
and then once it hits about 7-8K, it will just stagnate for about a year.
by mid 2020 it will slowly climb back up though.
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:00:15

that you didn't know this is hilarious!!!
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:21:48


well, thats because you want money from your company
for me, i am not asking for anything in return, just sharing my predictions.
they are nearly always correct, but people can follow them or not, i don't care.
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:30:31


ok, i just took a shit, and put it into my freezer, what's next?
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:33:37
ok, i have never written you an unsolicited message, i have only replied to messages you wrote me first
and, i am just noticing, that you took the time to write me over 20 times in an hour
um, dude
that is creepy
i am not sure why you are so obsessed
i mean, i am flattered with your constant attention, but its too much
please back off, you are giving off a creepy/desperate vibe
you just feel like a creepy dude to me.
its kinda icky.  anyway, no offense, you can't help what i feel (you seem creepy to me, and make me feel uncomfortable, but i doubt you are being creepy on purpose, its just how you come across)
anyway, no more messages please, too creepy, but best to you!
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:20:32
i jumped in before i knew what i ws doing.  i listened to the many voices saying "buy" in 2017.  so i bought
then, right when it crashed, i listen to those who said "buy the dip" (when the price was still over 15K) as the price would bounce right back, they said.
that was also a bad move.
after that, i learned more.  lesson number one, never buy bitcoin again (i haven't since early 2018)
and lesson number two, just hold and see what happens with what i have (that is what i am doing)
and lesson number three, stop listening to the "experts" they are either idiots, or have agendas that have more to do with self-enrichment, and almost nothing to do with reality.
since that time, i have stopped listening to others, and i soon realized that i could just naturally have a sense of where the market was going to go, and because i was no longer going to buy anymore, i was not emotionally affected, which helped me be even more accurate.
its been about a year, but i am insanely accurate at predicting, its kinda scary.
anyway, right now, the dip/crashing is not over, might go down to 7k, definitely down to 8k in the next several days
and then... it will not be coming back up for a while.  Might as well hodl, and definitely do not buy any more anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:26:58
no, my intuition says not to short it
my intuition says to not buy any more bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:52:29
or where they *want* you to think we are at with it?
in reality, they could be way ahead, but just keeping it under wraps
i mean, think about it, the department of defense, you trust them to share everything?
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:08:40
ok, copy that!

@_date: 2019-07-25 22:33:05
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:35:00
I really hope you’re joking with this comment.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:02:41


i'm a hodler, too
i bought in 2017 and 2018
and have held ever since.  i have been holding.  i just hope one day to at least break even
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:02:48
its gonna have a little dead cat bounce, and then go lower (probably to just under 10K is my best guess)
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:55:37
yes, i listened to a lot of Andreas Antonopoulos in 2017 and 2018
thats what inspired me to buy bitcoin.
so, i bought some, and i've done since then is lose money on bitcoin
since then, i learned to never listen to the "experts" again
it all sounds great, and all these grand ideas, but when i look at the actual numbers i put into bitcoin, and then what i have, i have 20% less than i put in
on the other hand, if i look at the money i put into stocks, that money went up 6% in 2017
9% in 2018
and 8% in 2019.
so, thats not as volatile and flashy as bitcoin, but my stock investment funds with Vanguard are a real work horse, just making me money, slow and steady, every year.
unlike bitcoin, which for me just loses me money every year.  yes i will HODL what i already bought, and sure, all these "experts" say it will go up one day for me, and maybe it will.
but all the flowery talk means nothing to me, i just want it to go up in value, and that hasn't happened.  when it does, i'll let you know.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:23:19
no, part of the reason i can predict so accurately is because i will never buy bitcoin again, and knowing that, it allows me to be emotionally detached, which is why i can see so much more clearly than those who have buying or selling clouding their vision.
@_date: 2019-07-12 09:27:56


i do
when i invest in something, and it just goes down in value (which is the case with me and bitcoin)
i think of it as a shitty investment, and i don't like it
i don't care it its on the way to being the new money.
i don't want to be the one who is losing money to fund someone else money-project
i am super poor, and struggling, and so i don't want to buy things that make me even poorer.  so far, thats all bitcoin has done, make me poorer
on here, i have been hearing fro years how bitcoin will go to 40K, some even say 100K
its a lot of talk, but in actual numbers, for me, bitcoin has only been a money toilet
but hey, thats just my ACTUAL experience, so thats what i base my opinions on (no matter what some far off stranger on a YouTube video tells me)
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:31:51
Oh, OK ...Kinda like Bon Jovi said:
"We've got to HODL on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if its moons or not
We've got bitcoin and that's a lot...
We'll give it a shot"
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:56:09
no, i dont do things like day trade, short term invest, pump n' dump, or short
being somewhat detached has actually (it turns out) enabled me to remain detached, which is why i think that i am so accurate
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:57:30


i see you do not know what the definition of "prediction" is
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:31:57


yes, will go to 7k
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:10:58
last i looked we were down 35% for the month
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:54:05
except on my version
i bought at 19K and 18 months later, i lost 40% of my money (that i put into bitcoin)
my version is that bitcoin is going down, down, down
i wish i could make money from bitcoin, but unless it goes to 20K again, the money i invested in bitcoin is just gonna be money down the drain for me.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:00:29
except, you weren't right, you were wrong
i was right
oh well... fact are sure pesky, huh?

@_date: 2019-07-05 01:25:13
hey, i hope you are right.
i am just saying, i don't honestly think that bitcoin will be going to 15K (at least not before 2024, at the earliest)
@_date: 2019-07-05 19:01:28
People say i am often too negative about bitcoin, on here.
OK, message received.
and because of that, i will NOT mention how bitcoin is doing today.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:28:52


many people online are
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:53:26
good move
my guess, it'll zig zag down to 7K, before coming back up again
you were wise to sell when you did.
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:41:14


well, that part is true
things are super bad in my life right so, so i'm super not-positive, that's for sure!
@_date: 2019-07-26 05:47:05
why are people freaking out?
I told you it was going to keep going down overall
just a slow slide until it hits $8K
after that, it will stop going down in price
but seriously, do not buy now, as it still has another $1700 to go down (and another 2 weeks at least of downward movement)
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:40:02
i simply expressed an opinion that i thought it was a good idea to by mostly and overwhelmingly bitcoin, but consider buying a few of the more established alts such as ETH, and LTE and XRP and stellar lumens
I mean, you can agree or disagree,
but its a pretty normal opinion, hardly a "troll"
seriously dude, you need to relax
you are clearly not cut out for crypto is me simply saying buy a few alts sets you off.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:09:25
oh, you are suggesting that a fellow redditor end their life?
you are advocating such a thing?
wow, that is super rude, and not nice at all.
I did ask you to stop writing to me (something you have done over 100 times)
but you still keep writing me insulting messages, over and over and over again.
**This is the last time i will say it, I am now saying that I forbid you from writing to me again.**
Please obey my wishes.
there is no place for people advocating what you did, here on bitcoin.
As such, maybe take a time out? think over what you said? and then come back AFTER you have done that.
No need to write me again, whatever you choose to do.
I will end by wishing you the best in your future endeavors, and also wish you a polite good day and bye-eeeee to you!
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:26:36


total lie
there were even a bunch (not the majority, but a bunch) that jumped on the macAffee bandwagon in saying bitcoin would go to one million
so, yes LOTS in 2017 said it would go to 40k, and plenty of others back then said it would even go to 100k
thats just the facts.  i remember, i was here, and thats when i was doing all my research, too.


and yes, i understand that people are  saying it is (they were saying that in 2017 too)
i am tired of people giving theories and future predictions
i look at the numbers.  numbers don't lie.  I put some money into buying biotin,  if i look at that amount that i put in then, its 40% less now.
all these bitcoin experts can try to tell me now how bitcoin is going to go way up, but until its an investment that makes money (not loses it) then i don't care about their predictions.
for example, i put some money into my stocks a couple of years ago.  two years ago it increased in value by 7% that year.
then last year, that same investment, it increased another 9%
when you take compound interest into account thats MORE than 16% in two years. 
On the other hand, i put some money into bitcoin about 18 months ago, and all it did was lose 40%
but bitcoin experts want to tell me that bitcoin did better?
um, ok. whatever.  i am looking at the math, and the math says bitcoin lost me money.
All this facebook Libra talk and "institutional investors getting in" talk etc, doesn't increase my bitcoin balance (which is still WAY negative).
if bitcoin ever makes me even one penny in profit, i'll change my mind, but for now its just a big money loser for me (even more so when you figure that if the money wasn't in bitcoin, it would have been invested in stocks that made 8% average a year).

sure, and i have been right every time, for the last several months, for the last year, really.
but hey, lets just wait and see what happens?
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:56:48
100% no.
we are going to go down to $8k in the next 2-4 weeks (probably will be about 2 weeks)
then it will stay at around $8k for about a year (during that year, there will be brief lows into the low 6Ks and brief spikes in the high 9Ks - but all in all, it will hover around $8K).
but no, it will never go to $5K
after a year at around $8K, it will slowly start to climb back up ...in the later half of 2020
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:53:37


one of the few?
so many thousands lost so much on crypto, but anyone who says this fact, gets attacked and downvoted into oblivion
this subreddit is great, but sadly... there are a few, VERY vocal bullies who will just attack and downvote anyone who shares how dangerous it is to invest in bitcoin, and they will also attack and downvote anyone who honestly shares having lost money on bitcoin.
I am not sure why non-pollyannaish opinions are so mercilessly and relentlessly attacked on here.
but i am one of the few who will not be silent, and i speak for those MANY thousands of us who lost money on bitcoin.
Its a gamble, at this point. Some lose, some win, but it is, by no means, a sure thing.  Downvote me or not, i will keep on telling that truth.
I am not saying don't buy bitcoin, and I am saying if you have some now, you might as well HODL (like i am) and see what happens.  But are you guaranteed future wealth by buying bitcoin? NOPE.  You might lose some or all (losing some is pretty likely), or you might make a little bit of profit (probably the most likely possibility) or you could lose it all (not the most likely, but possibly).
on the other hand, if you invest in stocks, you could be making 6-8% every year, compounded interest, so that's a pretty healthy return, and any money you do have in bitcoin, can't be making that sort of return.  So just having money tied up in bitcoin, is lost opportunity costs.
All things to consider, and by NO means is bitcoin a sure thing.  Thats all that I am trying to pass on and let people know.

this is the great battle between the whales

Personally... I'm rooting for the snails.

but if you PM me, i'll tell you
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:05:25
yes, that's one prediction
others predict it will go down
nothing personal, but i listened to those on here who said to buy before, and i did buy
now i am down negative 40% on what i invested
so yes, just for the hell of it, i will HODL what i already bought, 
but i will never buy bitcoin again.
nothing personal, your advice might be great, but i got burned so badly last time listening to advice in here, that i now remain skeptical, and i am done with all future investing in bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:05:44
oh, i joined in with the optimism
in 2017 and 2018
and i bought bitcoin, which (even now) is down negative 40% of what i paid for it.
but being positive i lost 40% of the money i put into bitcoin
being positive was the worst thing i ever did.
i'll tell you a little secret, i am a loser (shocking, i know) and as such, being pessimistic just suits me better, after all, its not like things are going to go well for me in my life anyway.
i could explain more, but i think you get the point.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:00:14
i never said i make all the right moves
i simple said that i seem to have an uncanny ability to accurately predict what bitcoin will do
call it a gift, i don't know?
but look at my past posts, you'll see how correct i was with bitcoin, time and time, and time again
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:21:25


yeah, if you bought bitcoin at this or that magical time (right before a spike) you'd be rich
i have heard it so many times.  AFTER THE FACT people are always exerts about when to buy
that is hilarious
yes, and here is my advice to you, if you had just bought in the past, in 2011, you'd be a billionaire, you are a FOOL, for now buying then, why didn't  you buy then???
seriously, enough with the backwards looking experts
i don't care about people who make claims (based on looking backward)
i look at the numbers, and my numbers are 40% less value now than when i bought 20 months ago.
oooops, i guess when i use real numbers, then bitcoin is a money loser after all.
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:45:53
i am a member of this subreddit
i have just as much a right to share my opinions as you do
why you think its ok to come on here and repeatedly personally insult me, i have no idea
seriously, treat all members of this group with respect
and you can agree or disagree, but everyone can share their opinions on bitcoin here, not just those who agree with you 100%

if people just believe me because i'm some random guy on reddit, then they are foolish
if they believe me because i'm so accurate, then that's pretty smart of them

100K bitcoin?

@_date: 2019-07-05 19:09:24
hodl: means to hold
halfing: no one knows what that means.
bull: refers to before 2018, when bitcoin was *really* going up.  until we get above 20k (which may or may not ever happen again), there is no bull.
bubble: that's when the price comes up fast, but then crashes.  its how million of people lost so much money on bitcoin.
ledger: its like a usb drive, but its made for holding bitcoin.  its a terrible product because if you have any issues, they don't offer real human technical support.  if you lose thousands, or have some security problem, etc, you're on your own to figure it out, which is a drag.  or you can email them for tech support, but they won't ever really write back with anything helpful (if they ever write back at all).
Avoid ledger is my advice.
anyway, hope that answers your questions, anything else you need to know, just holler.
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:49:22

i'm "entitled" because i expect a major financial institution to have a working phone number?
not to mention, coinbase says they have a customer support phone number, and yet... its just basically a pre-recorded messages version of a FAQ webpage.
seriously, when people invest money or buy a product, they like to have the ability to *contact* the company in case there is a problem
and by "contact" i don't mean spending weeks writing back and forth via email, to resolve even the simplest issue.

um, ok

@_date: 2019-07-16 23:24:21
as for your constant need to personally insult me, all because i have a different opinion on bitcoin prices than you, that seems (to me) to be very weird.
i mean, that you let it get to you does seem kinda strange to me.
oh well, maybe you want to try being happy and carefree, instead of angry and insulting? Anyway, just a suggestion
but insulting a man's job? wow, that seems kinda weird (even for you)
and yet, you insult me for my job, but you don't say anything about people on welfare who don't work at all, but just live off the hard work of others
yup, you just insult a working man, all while not saying anything about lazy people who just live off your taxes
ok, thats cool, bro.  you just keep on thinking like that, its weird to me, but whatever makes you happy

@_date: 2019-07-16 22:42:56
no, how many times do i have to say it?
in 2017 and 2018 i did NOT listen to my own intuition, instead i listened to the "experts"
i did what the experts and more experienced people on here advised me to do.
that did not work out for me, so i made a vow that (in regard to bitcoin) I would never listen to the experts again.
Now, i just listen to my own intuition, and ignore whatever the "experts" say.
once i started just listening to my own intuition, i noticed that i was able to predict with near-perfect accuracy
so, no, it was not my intuition that caused me to buy at the peak
but it IS my intuition that told me last weeks highs were just a bull trap (and in that, like all my other predictions these last few months, i have been 100% correct)
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:49:12
might as well HODL what you already bought
i think it will go up, but its gonna take some time, so you might as well dig in, and wait it out
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:50:37
yes, i agree
before i was down (at the worst of it) negative 80%
now i am just down negative 40% of the money i put into bitcoin
so, hardly a great investment...
but yes, you are correct, its still been a shitty investment (for me), but its less shitty now than it was before!
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:21:26
no point in buying anytime soon
we're going to zip zag down to $8K within the next month, although probably be there much sooner than one month
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:03:46
down a bunch yesterday
now its up 9%
no real reasons for such spikes and valleys
the pump n' dump whales are making billions right now.
caution, stay clear!
only ones who're gonna win this week are those who just HODL, and also the whales who will make big money off anyone else who tried to buy or sell this week.
this is a fake whale-run
consider yourself warned.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:03:33
yes, "just keep holding, and you'll be rich" they say
"any day now bitcoin will be back"
i've been doing that, i've been holding a year and a half, and i'm down -40%
but "it'll turn around" i keep hearing
um, ok.
i'll hold.
but i cant live in what will be one day.
right here, right now, bitcoin (to me) is a HUGE money loser, and its been the worst investment of my entire life
@_date: 2019-07-05 19:17:41

wow, thats soooo cool, bro!
everyone on here loves it when people like you just insult others (instead of talking about the daily discussion of bitcoin)

When I predicted it, it was in an uptrend
And I warned, in advance, that it was fleeting and would come down hard
It will keep crashing over the next couple of weeks or so, until it hits 8k
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:30:32
oh, i am down negative 40% (compared to what the average was of all i bought)
so, until it hits about 18 or 19K in am in the hole, big time
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:06:07
do what you want, if your intuition says to buy now, then do that
my intuition says to not buy now, as price will be trending downward some more
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:42:28
First of all, thanks for taking the time to share your experience and thoughts
Very helpful
Secondly, i understand what you are saying, its just that (when i originally bought in late 2017) nearly all the really experienced people on here were saying that bitcoin would keep rising, and would probably not peak until it hit around 40K ...and might even go on a run straight to 100k (and thats not even taking into account the wacky-birds saying it would go to 1 million dollars!)
I also spend many hours watching YouTube videos from the experts, and also reading multiple books on crypto, and the near-universal consensus from those who were the experts (and those on here) was that bitcoin was going to keep on rising in value for some time.  *I don't think i saw anyone who said it would crash from $20k to $3k in a little over a year*.  So, clearly there are some major blind spots in the ability of the experts to predict severe and extended crashes.
Obviously those who were optimistic were waaaaaay wrong.
plus, lets not forget, based on the ATH, we are still in a crash, and in deeply negative territory - but we have a little rally last few weeks and people on here are acting like we are in the ultimate bull market.  Sorry, not falling for it, bitcoin at $10k is better than at $3k, but bitcoin at $10k when it used to be $20K is hardly a great price.  Any other investment valued at 50% of what it was 18 months earlier would not be considered a solid investment by me.
So these days i don't rey on any experts (at least not more than i rely upon my own eyes)
My own eyes look at the many thousands i put into bitcoin, and then my eyes look at the value of my bitcoin holdings.
 
What i currently HODL is many thousands less than what i spent.
So, i judge my bitcoin investments on what I ACTUALLY MADE FROM THEM (not what others who invested at different times made).  And based purely on the real life numbers, as they actually are (not taking into future hopes of what they will be one day) bitcoin has been the worst investment of my entire life.
And my opinion of bitcoin will remain low unless it actually makes me money.
Anyway, thats my opinion, and when it comes to bitcoin, i am certainly NOT optimistic, but i guess i don't mind leaving what i bought alone, and just HODLing (just in case it does recover)
And as i mentioned before, i do *HOPE* you are correct, i do *HOPE* that bitcoin can struggle its way back to $20k,  its just that i won't believe it, until i actually see it.

@_date: 2019-07-05 02:19:11


i didnt
i slowly bought over the course of three months
and guess what?
i am down negative 40%
if i had bought all at once, it would be even worse!
but hey, i am not bitter, and i HAVE learned my lesson.  lesson is to HODL what i do have, but to never buy any new bitcoin again.
and in doing that, i am still in the hole, but instead of being 70% negative, i am "only" negative 40%
oh well, guess not losing 70% of my money, and just losing 40% is the better of the two options!
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:25:42
oh excuuuuse me for not taking time away from being homeless when i was living in my car, to buy more bitcoin
oh i'm sorry, what was i thinking? i'm such a bad investor, its totally my fault, and not because bitcoin has been a totally shitty, horrible, money losing investment FOR ME
yes, obviously for SOME, its been great.
but for others its been a real shit investment, for me, the worst investment of my life 
and i'm not the only one, there are literally hundreds of thousand of investors, people like you and me, who lost MANY thousands of dollars by purchasing bitcoin.
its a mix, but for SOME its been truly terrible to have bought bitcoin.  Nothing personal, but i guess you can't see over your own moneybags enough to be able to see how poorly bitcoin investing was for many of us.

@_date: 2019-07-16 23:13:54
yes, that is my point exactly
buying at the top is what happens when you listen to the bitcoin "experts" (thats what i did in the past)
being told days in advance about the crash today, which i was the one to warn about, is what happens when i listen to my intuition (which is what i do now).
i did put the warning to you all not to buy out in plenty of time, hopefully people saw it, listened to me, and did not buy any new bitcoin these last few days.
you think you are insulting me, LOL, in realty you prove my point, that my intuition is what people should be listening to.
p.s. the price will still go down, so anyone new reading this, do not buy any more bitcoin, it will only lose value.
@_date: 2019-07-31 19:07:50
no, i got into bitcoin, listening to the egghead "experts" and made the wrong choices.
so then i said, fuck those "experts" i'm just gonna predict based only on my feelings and my intuition (no more listing to the experts for me!)
since then i just started predicting based solely on my feelings and personal intuition, and since then have been near-perfectly correct every time (for the last 9 months)

would you like to insult me some more? i love it soooo much!  please, tell me how dumb i was to invest in 2017, and how even dumber i was to not time the market and invest again more recently.

its 18 months later, and we're STILL on the shitter
even the way people are so excited to be at 10K
we were at 10k in 2017
10k in 2018
and even may 2019 (a few months ago, we were at 10K)
we're at 10K again, in june 2019, so what?
we are still at only half of the ATH
sorry, but i just cant get excited about being at 50% of what were were less than a couple of years ago.
so i don't really think that 10K is a big deal, or anything that "healthy"
i mean, 10k is better than when it was down to 4k, but thats a pretty low bar.
if bitcoin rises to at least 15k it might mean something, but 10K again? naw, that doesnt mean a thing.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:08:00
its a bad investment now (for me), whether i sell or not
its even worse when you figure if i had put this money into my vanguard investment account, it would have made me about 8% return (so thats thousands in lost opportunity capital as well)
on every level this bitcoin investment of mine has been a real money toilet.
i hope you're right (about 40K) but please excuse me if i remain skeptical
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:35:06


at the time i bought it, i did
after it crashed and just stays down for 18 months, and is still crashing, even now... no, i think that bitcoin was a bad choice
for me, worst investment i ever bought, the absolute worst.
oh well... lesson learned, i'll never buy bitcoin again.
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:46:42










Yes, except the last part.
I said it will start climbing up from $8K in the second half of 2020.  It will be over $8K then, but it *might not* make it to $10K in the second part of 2020.

i bought some in 2017 and 2018 
and now i am at negative 40%
its been the worst investment of my life.
on the other hand, you are correct, if you cherry pick the exact right times to buy, and to sell, then yes... its been possible for some people to make money on bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:52:34
bitcoin going up 43% this month
i don't care about that, you know what? i look at longer terms 
in the 18 months since i have owned bitcoin, it has gone down 40%
thats right, i am down negative 40% of what i put into it.
in my personal opinion, any investment that i purchase, and then hold, and its still down 40% a year and a half later, is a bad investment (even if it does have a month where it goes up 43%)
thats just my opinion, but bitcoin has been nothing but a total money toilet to me, and done nothing but lose lose lose me money.
if your experience is different, good for you.  i am just sharing my actual real world experience, and in my real experience, bitcoin just loses me money.
if it ever makes me money, i'll change my mind.
but i have been on here 18 months, and many/most on here say that bitcoin will go up.
but, when i look at the actual numbers, and do the actual math, it loses me money every month.
so, you can tell me with words how it will be a money maker one day, but those are just words, i don't care about words, i just care about numbers
and in my experience, the numbers add up to a BIG huge loss.
and until the numbers say that bitcoin is a winner for me, i will continue to be skeptical about it ever doing well.
you can keep telling me what the experts say, but i don't care about FUTURE predictionS, i just care about now, and what its doing now (and right now, and for the last 18 months, its just an investment that loses me money)

i am just basing my opinion of my intuition on how its lined up with what has actually wound up happing
for the last 6-9 months, i have been incredibly accurate
so, thats not me acting "I am very smart" its simply me saying that I have been accurate (which is the case)
if my predictions start to be inaccurate, i will adjust my opinion, and also publicly state so.
btw, i am not telling anyone they need to follow my advice, in fact the only thing i am saying definitively is that people should stop listening to the "experts" and instead just follow their own intuition.
You don't need some expert telling you what to invest in, and when, just follow what feels right to you, and then do that (thats what i do, and since i started doing that i have noticed that I've been very accurate)
but yes, do not just blindly follow me,  follow your own inner guide where ever it leads, is what i say.

i mean, if you want to save energy then give a real reason like it saves money, or that it reduces pollution,  but dont just do it under some made up fake reason like saying it will save unicorns, or that its powered by leprechauns or that it will reduce "global warming" or some other nonsense.

you are talking nonsense
clearly you are just talking out your rear end
you think i sold it cheaper?
you just are making up lies now, i see
seriously, why would you do that?
i bought in 2017/2018
then i held
i've been holding 18 months or more
i am down negative 40%
but i have ONLY bought, and i never sold...
but please... since youre soooooo smart, please, tell me more about how i "sold it cheaper".
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:40:00
yes whales trigger the suckers
and then the whales clean up
thats why the whales do it, to get other peoples money
the whales dump a bunch of bitcoins into the market, that causes the price to go down and the whales buy a lot at the lower price.
that buying then causes the price to spike high, so then the whales sell and make a big profit.  (this selling when the price is high, causes another price drop, and the cycle starts all over again).
others might try to go along for the ride, but its the whales controlling the levers.
they do it on a large scale and can make billions in a day doing it

regarding uber, yes, because they are a bad company run by out-of-touch and dishonest billionaires, that do not even pay their workers minimum wage
so yeah... excuuuuuuse me, for not saying anything positive about them!
and do you seriously think that uber (that spends billions on publicity and advertising and driver recruitment) doesnt sent paid shills here to reddit (where we have the largest online community of uber drivers and users) to talk about how great the pay is, and what a great job it is?  
you think they are saints that are above that sort of thing?
you believe these obvious shills who claim to make $30/hour in LA, driving for uber?  LOL (i guarantee you claims like that are total lies, don't be a total chump and fall for that obvious nonsense).
Seriously dude, on multiple levels (and i say this with respect) but you really do need to grow a brain. 
in the meantime, 
here is a tough truth that you need to hear:
uber is a shitty, cruel, soul-crushing, greedy, immoral, company.  anyone with a soul and a compassion would be against them.
i hope you turn your heart around, and join us drivers in our fight for basic rights and respect.

Public Service Announcement:
Will we never learn?
The whales just played us, again (some of us anyway)
The whales just made themselves a few billion dollars in a few days by pumping and dumping.
Heres a few points to ponder:
- if you sold at the high like the whales did, you did well (most of us regular investors did not do that).
- if you just HODL during this price-spike, you didnt lose (so thats not too bad).
- but if you got caught up in the excitement and bought any new bitcoin during the pump, then you just got played, son.
in other words, HODLing is fine, but buying bitcoin when its being pumped and going up in price is a total suckers move.
Don't do it.

You come online to insult someone who's homeless, and to write long paragraphs lecturing them on how they don't have a positive enough attitude
oh wow!
Thanks, i guess i should just be a happy homeless guy as i live in my car and work for under minimum wage.
you really helped so much, i had no idea i was supposes to just buck up and be more positive when i am exploited at work, while being homeless as well.
and by the way, i bought some bitcoin in 2017.  so acting like i am now homeless and buying more is 100% wrong.
and i'm so glad to hear you're against minimum wage laws, if a company can get someone to work for slave wages, then thats ok with you?  OK, cool, i got it, you don't care about human rights or companies being decent in any way to their workers.
anyway, thanks again, i am sure that now (if i am just more positive) i will no longer be homeless, thank you for taking time to insult me, it was so helpful and turned everything around for me.
there is nothing an impoverished homeless person likes more, than someone with money giving us advice on how our attitude is not up to their standards.
i guess, i better turn my frown upside down, and get back to working at my below min wage job with a new sense of gratitude for my low wages!

@_date: 2019-07-16 23:18:54


i am not a day trader, and don't want to be tied to my computer anyway.
besides, by no longer buying bitcoin, i am not emotionally invested, which is another thing that just allows m the necessary detachment to see the market and not be swayed by emotion or worried about results.
i just see the market as it is, and then i can "see" where it is headed.
right now, it is headed down, then it will hit about 7-8K, then it will stagnate 
so, all in all, not a good time to buy.
as for your constant need to personally insult you, all because i have a different opinion on bitcoin prices than you, that seems (to me) to be very weird.
i mean, that you let it get to you does seem kinda strange to me.  
oh well, maybe you want to try being happy and carefree, instead of angry and insulting?  Anyway, just a suggestion

my gut tells me this is true
i will admit that i don't know enough to say for sure what bitcoin will do
but what you say makes sense
my personal opinion? bit coin will be down to $4k by the end of 2020 (although, it might be lower than even that is my guess)
but honestly, i just don't know.
but, from what i can tell, your comment seems like the smartest one i've seen.
oh well...
i guess we'll just have to wait and see, to really know where bitcoin will be in a year (but i think you are 100% correct, its all just a big scam at this point, and is throughout manipulated by pump n dump whales, that are just milking us regular investors all the way down to zero)

NOT to hurl personal insults at fellow members
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:58:04


oh, its a bad idea to not invest in something that has only been negative in value since nearly day one? and even now (18 months later) is still down 40% for me?
all while all my other investments like stocks are up 8-10% positive?
HAHA yeah right.  Sorry, bt thats called great logic.  You see, bitcoin has been a total money toilet to me.
I don't know why so many people are so nervous that they freak out when i simply point out that bitcoin (for me) has been the worst investment of my life, by far.  Even my savings account pays me positive 2% every year (and thats money i can actually see, it never loses money),  but bitcoin, i look at the balance and what do i see?  a number that is much less than the amount that i put into bitcoin (you can try to rationalize that away, but facts are facts, numbers are numbers).
and no grand claims of future greatness matter to me when the real numbers are that it is a total loser to me in actual money.
if bitcoin ever makes me even one penny in profit, then i'll reconsider.  but as long as its a total money loser (and to me it is) then i will tell the truth about it.
and no, some random online expert will not change my mind, when my eyes can look at my negative 40% bitcoin balance and know better.
and sure, if you buy at just the right time, and sell at the right exact time (on a volatile investment like bitcoin) you can make big money
but thinking you can time the market (unless you are a pump and dump whale) is a fools errand.
i have done what the so-called smart people said to do, which is HODL
i have HODL, and i am still HODLing, and guess what, even doing what everyone says (HODLing) i am still in the hole and with less money than i had on day one)
Like i said, people can come up with all sorts of crazy claims about how you can make money on bitcoin, but until i look at my bitcoin balance and see it in positive territory, i will believe my eyes, and my balance before i believe any of these "experts"
by the way, nice touch at the end, to make fun of me for being homeless, wow, you are a really decent person.
@_date: 2019-07-23 05:12:14


sure, if you want to. although, timing the dip can be tricky.
personally, with a dip thats "just" 20%, and one that'll have spikes (up and down) all along the way, you can sell now and buy when it gets to 8k or near if you wish (its pretty much garanteed that you can make at least 10% profit, even if your timing isn't that perfect - still, if you HODL its kinda like forced savings.
personally, i just think its easier (for me, anyway) to just HODL and then just tell myself i won't touch it for a year or more.
or more like 2 years at least, which is how long it will take to get back to $15k or higher (which is the lowest i would ever sell at)

i am not talking theoretical instances where (in hindsight) you time the market perfectly.
i am talking real life,  and in real life, i bought in 2017 and 2018
since then i have just HODL
and guess what, in my real life, i am down 40%
so, thats real math, not wishful thinking.
but hey, the main point of your post seems to be to insult me
really, thats why you come on here to post? to insult others? wow, thats kinda cruel, and sure makes it seem like you are a shitty person.
just insult and put down others who simply shared that they invested and lost money?

so sure, i HOPE it goes to 100k
but thats what people were saying in 2017 (some were even saying 1 million)
and what happened, it went to 3k
so, excuse me, i've seen this all before, bitcoin going to 100k?
�� �� ��
it makes me laugh every time.
no, i don't think it will, but hey... if it does, that would be cool
it would be cool if i won't the lottery too.
i guess, we'll just wait and see what it does.
but 100K???

personally, i do not see that happening.
(but no, i never said i knew anything technical, i am just basing my opinion on what i think i never said i was an expert, i am just a guy who bought bitcoin in 2017 and 2018, and in doing so, i lost a shit ton of money, oh well.  live and learn i say.

definitely HODL
price is going to go down about 20-25% (within the month)
and then its gonna stay there about a year
so, no point in buying any new bitcoin now, you'll just lose money, and then its not going to go back up for quite some time

no, there are reasons to do things besides intuition

if buying at 20k taught me anything, its that i am not good at timing the market.
its like Clint Eastwood said in *Magnum Force* "A man's got to know his limitations"
My limitation is that i am bad at investing in bitcoin, and even worse at being able to time the market.
As such, yes i will HODL what i already bought, but i will never buy bitcoin again.
bitcoin has been nothing but a money toilet to me.   Fool me once, shame on me, but i won't get fooled again.
Yes, i am going to HODL, but all future investment decisions i will leave to my broker (they make me a solid and consistent 6-8% percent positive return on my investment every year).
and hey, given the choice between negative 40% return, or positive 6% return, i will choose the positive 6% return every day.

i did buy at 18k, and by the time it was at 3k i was broke
recently i was homeless, so buying more bitcoin wasn't an option
i am HODLing what i bought before, and i have a couch to crash on for now.
but i could sure use that money (that i lost by buying bitcoin) now.
oh well...
some people are barn winners (not me)
and others are born losers (i think this is me)
others are losers that learn to turn it around (i hope this is me, but based on my actual life, i would say no to this option, thus far)
so, i spend only what i could afford in 2017
lost most of it, due to bad timing, i guess the universe wanted me to lose that money.
oh well, i guess that's my life.
i know some people write self help books on how to be a winner at life and they make a lot of money doing that.
if only there was someone who would pay for someone to write a book on how to be a loser, if that every happened i'd be the biggest selling author of all time ...although, if i had managed to make money by writing a best selling book about being a loser, then that would mean that i failed at being a loser.  and thats impossible (for me).  cause, hey...  if there's one thing i ALWAYS succeed at, its being a loser.

@_date: 2019-07-27 16:44:28
a little more than couple of weeks ago, when bitcoin was around $12.9k
i started warning everybody it was going down.
I was quite clear that it was going to crash down to $8k within a month.
We are just over at $9k now
so please, if you dont want to lose any money, dont buy bitcoin now.
its gonna keep going down a bit more (some minor spikes and valleys along the way)
I have been 100% correct on this all along.
I guarantee its gonna keep crashing to $8k.
Anyway, do what you want, just dont say i didnt warn you.
be safe, HODL what you do have, dont buy any new BTC
and then once it hits $8k, it will stabilize a bit.
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:45:24
yes, if it hits 40K
i've long since stopped judging bitcoin based on what it might do one day.
right now i just run the hard numbers, and the hard numbers (for me) are that bitcoin lost 40% of the money that i put into it.
and i cant really think about, ponder, or speculate about what it will do *one day*, or what a future ATH *might* be.
so sure, it might be worth more one day, it might be worth less, i honestly can not say that i know.
i'll just HODL and HOPE, and hey... if you are correct, then i will be a very happy man and if not... then so be it, i took a chance on bitcoin, and it let me down.

@_date: 2019-07-18 23:06:08
yes, i have spoken many times about how in late 2017 and early 2018 i listened to the "experts" and bout then, and even kept buying the dip, cause thats what those on here, and the experts said to do.
i lost money
since then i made a vow to never listen to the experts ever again, and to ONLY to listen to my own intuition
my own intuition tends to be near-100% correct
so, i say now (and have for some time) people should never trust the experts, and people should just do what they feel is right
and hey, if it feels right to listen to me, then do that
whatever you want to do, thats what you should do.  trust your own gut, and ignore the "wisdom" of the "experts"

flat earth is a silly and thoroughly disproven theory
its been disproven for hundreds of years
global warming (or climate change, or global cooling, or greenhouse effect, or whatever they are calling it this week) is also a disproven theory
yes, climate changes (it always has) but its not due to CO2, also the so-called "solutions" wouldn't do anything but waste trillions of dollars, and just about every other part of this theory has been debunked as well.
Anyway, unlike flat earth theory, global warming has only recently been debunked, but its still just as fake as the flat earth nonsense.
Heres just one recent study, if youre curious about the real science:
Not to mention, every penny that we waste on "solving" global warming is money that we should be spending on real environmental problems like polluted air and water, etc.
nothing personal, i am not saying you should trust me, but just do your own research and you'll see.
there are a few holders-on to this theory, but the trend and the leading minds are all fleeing from the silly, ridiculous theory of global warming (even though a few lowIQ folks are ignoring that its Summer and freaking out because the temperatures are going up in July and August! Oh NO!!!)
anyway, do your own investigating, you'll see.
peace to you!
@_date: 2019-07-20 04:54:54
are you serious?
its JULY
its called SUMMER
al gore said they would all be melted by now, but in reality, there is more ice up there now than there was 20 years ago
and besides, climate changes, there is nothing wrong with that.
sometimes it goes up, sometimes down
its called nature
seriously, did you not read the most recent science?
then at least read this:
nothing personal, i know many people are brainwashed by certain education systems, 
but the real deal is that global warming is a hoax, and its simple to find out, just look
and hey CO2 is not bad, its just part of air, relax, the planet is fine.
i mean, yes, we do have real problems, we need to clean up the air and water, but global warming? that is not anything you need to fret about.
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:13:09
dont be such a doubting Thomas
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:26:32
its not over yet
i am saying it'll be a 45-50% correction
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:58:13
i put a bunch of money into bitcoin, and now 40% of that money is totally gone
i am negative 40% on what i bought.
anyway, i am not sure what the minimum amount is, but i do know that i did lose A LOT of money, so maybe its better that you didnt buy any?
thats just me, i lost money, but in all fairness, i will admit, there are people wh have made money from bitcoin (although they seem to mainly be people who bought in 2017 and before)
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:35:36
that was in the past, i have talked about that many times.
i already mentioned that i listened to the "experts", and then following their advice bought in 2017 and 2018
since then, i have learned ...a lot.
now, since i don't buy at all, i am emotionally detached, and have been amazingly accurate at predicting
@_date: 2019-07-27 03:15:22
Not sure why you come on here to personally insult me? 
if you disagree with my thoughts on bitcoin, thats cool.
but calling a fellow user a "troll"?
thats against the r/bitcoin TOS
please, follow the trues, and no more name-calling.  Its against the rules, its abusive, and its a violation of the TOS
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:44:13
sure, pick and choose (aft earth fact) when you would have bought, and anyone can be a winner
if we are going to play that game, if i had bought bitcoin in 2011 i'd be a winner, too.
in reality, i am talking about me (not some magical version of me that could perfectly time the market, lol).
i mean, hey... if i bought apple stock in 1992 i'd be rich, or microsoft in 1990, or shares of amazon in 2008, i'd be doing great as well.
but none of those are reality, so i'll stick with what actually happened (as opposed to what i dream could have happened), if you don't mind?
No offense, but imagining "what if", as opposed to what actually happened, is never a fruitful way of looking at one's life.
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:04:43
yes, i hope so.
i think of all the money i could have made these last two years, if i had put the money i invested in bitcoin, in with the rest of my investment cash (which i put into my Vanguard stock portfolio)
i would be up many thousands of dollars
as it is, i am down 40% of what i put in, and then much more in lost opportunity costs, by having that money tied up in bitcoin.
i don't see how i can ever make a positive return  off the money i put into bitcoin, but if i can even break even one day, i would be happy.
oh well...
i guess we'lll just have to wait and see what happens?
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:34:50
not wrong
i am correct
bitcoin serves more than one purpose
one of those purposes is as an investment
that you didn't know bitcoin is an investment to many is funny to me
i mean, really???
you didnt know bitcoin was an investment to many people??
oh my!
thats a new one.
anyway, glad i could help, have a good day!
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:08:54
oh, not me
i have a vague idea, but i am not really sure what it is, or what it means, or when it happens
@_date: 2019-07-05 07:14:11
um, ok, whatever you say
if you saaaay so!
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:44:02
well, i am a genius 
so thanks
but no voodoo there, i just call it like i see it
100% straightforward
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:32:07


sorry, but yes i did invest in 2017 and 2018
and i did HODL (for more than a year, for nearly 20 months now)
but also sorry, but being homeless in 2019 did interfere with my ability to dollar cast average and invest even more
besides, invest more in an investment that is (even now) down 40%?
nothing personal, but no thanks.  yes its at 10k or so now, but it still seems like a real turkey, and a real shit investment to me.
if bitcoin even makes me even one penny in profit, i'll change my mind, but until it can do even that simple thing (make me any profit at all) i am though with it.
Yes, i wil HODL, but i will never buy more bitcoin again.  its been nothing but a money-toilet to me for nearly 18 months straight
@_date: 2019-07-02 01:52:59
and its one i made once...
but never agin.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:50:56
i don't think so
as long as they can still pump and dump alts, they want to keep them around
whales don't really care about long term dominance, they are more into just making money off years of pump n dumps
@_date: 2019-07-28 07:16:48
well, i am neither
i just say my predictions
but admit i am no expert
and in the long term bitcoin should be fine (so i am not a naysayer)
for the next year? it will go down to approx. 8k soon, and then stay around that price for for 10-12 months
since bitcoin is just going to go down a little, and then just stay there, my advice? prepare to HODL for *at least* 2 years, maybe more.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:21:20
yes, i do agree with you 100%, for those who bought in the summer of 2017 and before, its been great
you all made plenty of money
but, i think the days of making real money (unless you time it just right) are over
will they ever come back?
i don't know, but i hope you are correct
but, i'll believe it when i see it
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:31:47
so true
but love the way you said it, too
so funny

you don't seem sorry, you seem to be enjoying it
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:10:48
yes, you are
got you
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:00:53
well, you may be right
as for me, i bought 18 months ago.
i have HODL since day one, i just HODL and never sell
so, how is my investment in bitcoin doing?
well, i have HODL, and guess what? i am at negative 40%
thats right, by HODLing, i have lost 40% of the money that i put into bitcoin.
i know others are making money from bitcoin, but not me.
i lost 40% of the money i put into bitcoin.  its been the worst investment of my life.
any investment that i purchase, and then hold for a year and a half, and then look at to see its down 40%, well... in my book, thats a bad investment.
but hey, people keep telling me that this money-losing investment is a good investment, i don't see it (but hey, maybe they know more than i do?)
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:20:43
ok, creeper, whatever you say
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:14:58
yes, that chart shows that, for many of us, they are ALL money losers.
if your argument is that bitcoin is a money loser, just not as MUCH of a money loser, thats hardly inspiring investment argument for bitcoin.
and hey, hers something to think about... if the other coins are down, and if the other coins tend to follow bitcoin (which they often do) then they have more room to grow, and more can possibly be made from them (as bitcoin's rise if a pretty accurate predictor of what the alts *might* do).  If ever there was a time to buy certain alts, that time would be now.
nothing is guaranteed, but the safest move it to invest mostly in bitcoin, but diversify a bit and put SOME of your investments into ETH, and LTE and XRP and stellar lumens (especially now, while they are still poised to possibly rebound even more, but have not yet done so).
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:34:04


anything is possible
just looked right now, and its down 7% right now, so thats not a good sign.
kinda reminds me of when i said earlier " i don't honestly think that bitcoin will be going to 15K "
anyway, thats my reply to your bitcoin related comment.
as for the part where you say I'm "retarded"
well... for that part of your comment where you rudely personally insult me, let me say...
fuck you!

and my real estate investments are doing great
bitcoin is the only real loser i own.
so yes (to me) bitcoin is the ultimate money toilet, but lucky for me i diversified, and thats made all the difference.

"How To Lose Money"  by I. M. Poore
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:04:36
um, call me what you want
but if you look at my predictions, you will see (time and time again) how incredibly accurate i am at predicting the bitcoin market and prices.
I dont charge for my predictions, and I dont say anyone should even listen to me if they dont want to
I simply put my predictions out there to be helpful
Use the info i provide if you wish to, if not, dont use it.
My real message is to not listen to the "experts" and just follow your *own* heart, and just do whatever feels right, to you!
@_date: 2019-07-10 04:09:39
i won't kick myself for not buying more
as buying more isn't even an option
i have zero extra money, so i couldn't buy more if i wanted to
still, i will HODL what i already have
and hey... if it does go up, i'll be happy

that was not my intent, i repeatedly say that i am not an expert, and thats just my opinion, and i tell others its a free country, just do as you wish
anyway, i do seem to have a gift at correctly predicting, so i was just sharing my predictions with my fellow bit coiners, do what you will with them, 
best to all!
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:13:05


i am obviously not the person to look to for investing acumen
as i am the guy who lost thousands and thousands
and 18 months later, i am still negative40% on what i invested
so, i am not saying my thought process is correct.
i am simply saying that (for me) any investment that i buy, and then look at 18 months later and its down 40%, is (to me) a bad investment.
and, my thought process is that i should not invest in things that just lose me money.
i would rather, at this point, just put my money into my vanguard investing account, where i can reliably make positive 6%-8% returns every single year.
it may not be as sexy as the roller coaster ride that is crypto investing, but for me, to make positive returns is much more pleasing than losing 40% of the money that i put into an investment like bitcoin
so, there you go, thats my thought process.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:17:32
I have no idea of whether BTC is a scam,
Nor can i speak for the experiences of others.
Speaking for myself ONLY, yes i did buy a bunch of BTC,
and based on what i paid, and what BTC is valued at right now, i did lose about 20% of the money i put into bitcoin.
I keep hearing that lots of others made money from bitcoin, and honestly... i just don't know the answer.
Seems like some people might be making money from bitcoin, but has anyone made really good money since 2018 began?
I do not know.
I guess i will just wait for someone to tell me that.
Is bitcoin a good investment for those who bought in after the end of 2017?
I don't know, but i am open to hearing what others more knowledgeable have to say.
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:02:30
i just predict what my intuition tells me
and over the last year, i'm always right
oh well...
i am not telling anyone to follow me, i simply share my predictions and then tell others to follow their own hearts (just as i followed and listened to my own)
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:42:15
yes, good point
always good to be positive
best to you!!!
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:35:15
you love to lose money, huh?
bitcoin in going down to 7-8K in the next 10 days, and then will stagnate there for a year
to buy now is foolish
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:27:22
Don't you know that bitcoin's going up, up, up, up, up?

@_date: 2019-07-13 23:16:08
?  huh
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:24:23
i don't think it will go to 6k, i think after it hits 8k it will just stagnate there a little
i guess we can just wait and see
you could be right
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:17:47
yes, lots of people get angry whenever people say bitcoin price will go down
i am not sure why
serious question, as you have been around longer than i have
why do you think so many on here just start to rage out whenever someone expresses an bearish opinion on bitcoin?
i am not saying you do this, but MANY on here do.
they don't rage out or mind if someone predicts a bull market, but when someone just as politely predicts a bear market, there are some people that just lose their minds and start insulting whoever made the perish prediction
its like they want to not have bearish opinions even be allowed
why do you think that is? do you know?
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:03:08
oh, i was wondering who was affecting the price
i thought it was the whales, but it turns out it was you all along
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:10:16


i did tons of research on bitcoin, read a book, watched hundreds of videos
and guess what? in late 2017, the "experts" almost all agreed that bitcoin was going to keep going up, to 40k said MANY
no one predicted it would crash down to 3k (NO ONE!)
so, hey, i listed to the "experts" and also the people on here, and i slowly, over the course of a few months, started buying bitcoin
and guess what? then it crashed.
i still listened to the experts, and i HODL
i'm still HODLing, and i am still way down
fuck the experts, all that listening to them got me was a bunch of lost money.
so to hell with the stupid experts, they all have all the answers AFTER the fact, but when it comes to predicting, they were all wrong.
i can look at the numbers and see that.
but hey, for personally insulting me, and kicking me while i am down, thank you sooooo much!
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:17:50
oh, it will be down to 8K 
might even be a few days
thats just my guess, so do as you feel is best is my advice, 
and my other advice, is when it comes to bitcoin, never listen to the "experts" that the worst thing you can do IMO
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:47:34


me too
although i am much less optimistic,
for me, its like a lottery ticket, i assume it won't win, but i will be happy if it somehow does
@_date: 2019-07-25 23:41:04
yes, mac and dennis are like the govt
giving away "money" to the lazy non-working people
and the lazy non-working people just spend it on getting high and drunk
sadly, those of us with jobs work our  off, and get taxed
and those taxes just go to buy things for the lazy do-nothings
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:05:11


i did
came back after a year, and it still sucks
40% negative, after holding 18 months
@_date: 2019-07-24 07:15:36
i see you didnt include the part where i say that people should listen to their own heart, and follow their OWN intuition.
or the other parts where i say never listen to any "experts"
just do what feels right to you.
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:34:59
Sure, I support anyone making their own decisions.
I offer my opinion, but ultimately... i say don't listen to any one else, especially not "experts".
My message is to each person is to listen to your *own* intuition, and do what feels right to you in the moment.
So no matter what i say, if it feels right to you to buy today, then go for it.
To someone else, if it feels right to listen my advice, then do that.
The point is there is not ONE right answer for everyone.  There is no one-size-fits-all bitcoin investing advice.  Everyone must do their own thang!
The biggest mistake anyone buying bitcoin can make is to listen to others, instead of just doing what *feels good* to them.
After all, if you are not having fun, youre not doing it right.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:48:25
yes, NOW people always have some excuse for why i lost money 
at the time, those same people (on here and otherwise) said bitcoin was going to 40K - maybe even as high as 100k before correcting
i listened to them, and guess what? i am now down 40% of what i was when i bought.
so sure... lots of experts now telling me to HODL or i should watch charts more.
but fuck it, but bit coin has been nothing but a money toilet for me.
yes, i will HODL what i *already* bought, but i will never buy any more.
i am going to HODL, but really just to see what it does.  i am not saying it won't go up again to 20k, but understand why i am skeptical of those who are bulls, as your predictions in late 2017-early 2018 (when i originally bought) were 100% wrong
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:54:36
i have been saying this price and these dates for a couple weeks now
@_date: 2019-07-28 00:56:59
"why the price is going up" 
um, sorry china, price is going down
and if you believe my super accurate predictions, its gonna keep going down until it hits 8k
(once it hits about 8k, it will level off for a bit)
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:49:53
oh wow, i'll read it over now
very helpful!
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:20:10


just a suggestion, but maybe you could just take a time machine and go back to when you were originally buying this bitcoin, and just buy a bunch more?
then you can come back to the present day, and open it, and you can be rich now.
anyway, i am not sure how to work a time machine, but if you know, maybe my suggestion might help?
good luck!
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:20:50
yes, i am not defending shitcoins, at all
i was just talking about the specifics of this weeks huge pump and dump

then anyone who's wrong is really wrong

you must be the happiest man alive
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:26:36
yes, in a few weeks we will be at 8K
that i can guarantee
once it hits $8k, its gonna stay in that price range for about a year
so no rush, just wait and then you'll have an entire year to buy at $8K price
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:06:00
wow, excuse me.
no need to be rude.
just block me if you don't like, you won't see.
lets all be civil to each other on here, shall we?
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:38:34
well, buying bitcoin did free me of 20% the money i put into bitcoin.
just by buying bitcoin, i have 20% less money.
wow! so free.
thank you bitcoin for freeing me!
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:37:38
i don't invest in any specific reits
i just have several investment accounts with vanguard (which is a mix of investments)
Vanguard has been great. (usually returns in the + 6% - 8% the last few years).
As for my "real estate investments" i am a realtor here in Los Angeles.
So, i am out looking at properties for clients all the time, and sometimes if i come across an affordable fixer or potential investment property, i will buy it (not too often, but when i can).  But the actual physical real estate that i have invested in, has increased in value.  
Anyway, those have worked out well, so thats what i meant when i said "my real estate investments are doing great"

and 


and there we go again, folks.
i am trying to talk about bitcoin, and what it will do, and this guy is just personally insulting me.
c'mon buddy, stay on the top of bitcoin, or just stop talking to me,
i have no desire to engage with someone who just constantly and repeatedly engages in personal insults.
would you like to actually talk about bitcoin? if so, then sure... i am happy to have a polite discussion on THAT subject.
but these personal insults and that sort of low-brow approach does not appeal to me at all.
if you want to have an intelligent conversation thats cool, if not, then please go away.
bye bye.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:28:04
No thank you,
I'll pass.
the only thing I really wish to write today is...
a brief note asking those here on r/bitcoin to not personally insult fellow members.
additionally, i would request that members of r/bitcoin refrain from vulgar, off-topic, put-downs.
after all, if we are to make this community more civilized, then it must begin with us.
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:01:19
thats solid advice
thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:52:55
hey no problem and thanks for the encouraging words!
if there's a lesson to learn, its that i am too dumb (in regards to investing) to know when to buy
so, i will HODL what bitcoin i already have, but i will never buy any more bitcoin, or ever make any independent investment advice.
other than the bitcoin i currently own, i will just leave all other investment decisions to my broker (Vanguard)
Vanguard makes me a nice 6-8% every year on what i invest.  And believe me, its not as sexy to make 6% on an investment compared to the crazy roller coaster of crypto investing, but its a lot better than bitcoin (which is just a huge money loser - for me, anyway).
p.s. i am not some shill for vanguard, i have also invested with charles swab and merrill lynch, and they are both great, too.  I just personally like vanguard.  Do your own research on which broker is best for you (hint: low fees are good, and hint  the "personal finance" subreddit has some great info, also).

"Anyway, do what you want"

@_date: 2019-07-19 04:44:02
ended what?
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:06:07
As I have said before....
yes, i have spoken many times about how in late 2017 and early 2018 i listened to the "experts" and bout then, and even kept buying the dip, cause thats what those on here, and the experts said to do.
i lost money
since then i made a vow to never listen to the experts ever again, and to ONLY to listen to my own intuition
my own intuition tends to be near-100% correct
so, i say now (and have for some time) people should never trust the experts, and people should just do what they feel is right
and hey, if it feels right to listen to me, then do that
whatever you want to do, thats what you should do.  trust your own gut, and ignore the "wisdom" of the "experts"
@_date: 2019-07-10 04:11:57
wow, you are so focused on me
must be nice to love someone as much as you love me
sorry , its not reciprocated, though
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:13:09


yes, i never denied that for those who got in early enough, that bitcoin made them money, lots of it.  I look at bitcoin as being just like Barnes&amp;Noble or AmericaOnline, it was good in the past, but now just struggles along. 
i am simply saying that i think that the make-big-money-on-bitcoin days are long since passed, and that bitcoin will never ever be at 20K again.
i think that (from now on) it will just be a series of peaks and valleys (always way below the ATH of 20K) and it'll just be kept alive because of whales doing endless pump and dump schemes.
the pump and dump whales will slowly milk all they can from the regular investors, on the way down.  Eventually, even they won't be able to squeeze anything else from it, and the price will be so far below what it costs to mine, and it will become such a joke to invested, that it will just sit at $3k or less, only kept in existence due to those few remaining die-hard HODLers who refuse to give up the dream.
Anyway, thats just my *opinion* on what will happen.  I admit that I don't really know.
and hey... i do *HOPE* you are correct.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see?

unless you need the degree for your career (such as doctor or lawyer or teacher) you might want to consider just working now
a college degree and the debt it ensues, plus 4 years of low or no income is a terrible financial decision in many cases.
in many (or most?) cases, its often better to just work for those 4 years, learn a skill, and then have no debt, and even money saved, and at the end of those 4 years,  you'll be making more than those college grads (who in many cases won't even have real skills) and you will be ahead of them in real life work experience, too.
anyway, not sure what you are studying, but you might want to consider just saying fuck college, and just doing what you want.  if you do that, you could easily have several bitcoins over the next few years.
besides, in many careers, computer sciences, entertainment, real estate, finance, etc, the real "education" is in doing the job, not in the classroom.

yes, its safer to invest in stocks, but use a reputable company like Vanguard (charles Schwab is also good)
check out the logical subreddit r/personalfinance for more info in secure investing, and also learn that compound interest is your friend, and can make huge gains likely, if you are wise.
besides growth funds from Vanguard or other good companies, you can also invest in something like bitcoin (i know i did - in my case, i lost 20% of what i put into bitcoin - but what they hell, i am still HODLing, why not? might as well see what happens, it could actually turn around??? I'm not counting on that, but might as well ride it out at this point)
just be aware that bitcoin is much less safe, more of a gamble, and losing all you invest, although not likely, is is possible.
on the other hand, you can much more safely and securely invest in a mixture of stocks and bonds, and be more secure and have more reliable and secure income.
whatever they case, or whatever you do, its up to you.
just listen to whomever you want (although, i am incredibly accurate, so consider listening to me)
and whatever else you do, don't invest in bitcoin any more than you can afford to lose (as losing it all could happen)
on the other hand, its possible that you can actually make money by investing in bitcoin.
people who bought before 2017 are doing really well (people who bought after 2017? its a mixed bag, some did well, some did not).
good luck everyone! i hope you ALL get rich!
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:26:32
maybe never
but if youre wondering what the future holds, its this
bitcoin will go to $8k soon
then it will hover in that range for about a year
and then, sometime in the second half of 2020 it will start to come back up in price
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:43:29
i started buying little bits in nov 2017, then seeing that grow, i bought even more in december 2017
i bought in early 2018 also, and even after the first part of the crash, when everyone was saying "buy the dip - it'll rebound up to 100K" (it obviously never did rebound - not ever to even where it was).
after i lost 25% or so of my money (sometime in Jan 2018 - i said fuck it, i am not buying any more, i will just HODL)
i wound up down negative 75% at the lowest points.
now i am "only" down 40%
its still the worst investment of my life, and people are still telling me i'll make my money back, and even make money one day.
so sure, i am still HODLing, i haven't sold any of what i bought.  but please excuse me if i remain skeptical of those on here who say it will one day be a big money maker.
sure, some people made money, but others (like me) lost a large percentage of what we put into it, and i am still in negative territory, big time.
in conclusion, yes, i know some (many in fact) made money on bitcoin, but not me.  Luckily, i did also invest in the stock market, which has made me 6% growth every year, which it soooooo much better than bitcoin (which has been nothing but a money toilet for me)
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:33:43
good luck
but seriously... they are the worst company.
any other company i have to deal with to solve an issue (Amazon, my bank, FedEx, Walmart, even T-mobile) i just call them, maybe i'm on hold for a few minutes, then i talk to a human being and we fix the issue, whatever it is.
but with coinbase, its essentially impossible to get a human (I know i cant) and everything takes days and days (and even then, they never/rarely ever solve or fix the problem)
seriously, its like the most inept, non-functional company i have ever dealt with.
if thats how they are dealing with us customers, i cant even imagine what they are doing (and screwing up) behind the scenes!

@_date: 2019-07-02 04:15:55


buy more of the biggest investment loser i ever bought?
no disrespect, but i think i'll pass on that suggestion.
no sense in putting good money after bad.
i mean, yes... i have been "waiting it out", for 18 months in fact.
i keep waiting, and i am STILL in deep, deep negative territory
i usually just try to forget about it, and hope that those who say its coming back are correct (I really WANT you all to be right)
but, every once in a while, i come back and check, and i'm still way in the hole.
I've only made money for a brief period when i was first buying, but since then... its been ALL negative, month after month, after month, after month...etc.
i am HODLing, and yes... one day it might be worth something, but for me the real proof is the numbers
no one telling me "one day it will be worth soooo much" convinces me (even if they are nice and smart, like you seem to be)
all i really care about with an investment is "does it make me money, or lose me money?"
and based on that metric, all bitcoin does is lose me money, it loses me lots of money.
if that ever changed, i will be the first one to admit it, and i will be dancing in the streets with every bitcoin enthusiast that ever existed.
but until then, i say show me the money (and until it makes me some money, i'll continue to consider it a failure in MY portfolio).
as for those who bought at the right time to actually make money on your bitcoin purchase, congrats to you!

@_date: 2019-07-31 04:16:54
and don't forget, there are always whales that can (and do) manipulate the price to their own benefit, all the time.
and their benefit means the rest of lose every time they win (and they win a lot).
so, its not even like a casino where at least the regular guy can have a chance like everyone else, and its also not like vegas, in that some super rich guy can't just dump a ton of money on the casino table and then be guaranteed to win.

thanks for answering the question, very helpful
as for you saying 


actually, that might be the case for robinhood, but for most others, especially for new people that dont necessarily know about things like coinbase pro or other discount exchanges
and those who are first getting into it, the fees are often MUCH higher.
MUCH MUCH MUCH Higher!
i mean, have you seen the fees that many exchanges charge (on both the buying and exporting ends?)
and the fees that bitcoin ATMs charge?
etc etc etc
the fees can be REALLY high.
on the other hand, if someone has a regular bank account, anyone can easily find a no-fee bank for checking or savings
and its simple for anyone to find a no-fee ATM
and anyone can use their credit or debit card and pay zero fees.
All i am saying is that there should be a simple no fee way for people to buy and use bitcoin, without having high fees, or easy to understand fees in advance.
for your average person, other than as an investment, there really is no reason to use bitcoin.
Your average person isn't in it for the technology, they would be in it of they could understand it, and if the fees where simpler and easy to understand.
Oh well... one day I guess (I hope)
But if bitcoin can not make things simpler for new people, and not just for those like us who know all about it, then i dont think it will ever catch on.
one (of many) popular solutions is for regular, exiting banks to allow people to store their bitcoin there (just the way you store fiat).  That way you can have a safe place to keep your crypto assets, and you can also have transparency, security, and low or no fees (like is the case with the better banks, no fees).
There's other solutions too, but having regular banks hold your bitcoin and other assets seems like a simple solution, or a good first step at least.

@_date: 2019-07-23 19:38:28
well, actually they are both (�� and ��) in favor if bitcoin moving, just not right away.  For the immediate short term (rest of the year, or so) both are cool with it settling in to a 10K or sp price and just staying there.  Its only the speculators and day traders that want an immediate and drastic price change.
You see, the whales �� want it to stabilize, so that more people get in, so that (in the future) the whales �� can have even more people to make money off of with their pump and dump schemes.
The whales �� can make money either way (whether it goes up or down) just as long as it doesn't totally crash.  The whales �� just want more people in the bitcoin marketplace overall. 
The snails �� on the other hand, want the price to go up, and they want more people and businesses to buy/use bitcoin, and the snails �� also want the price to be stable enough so that it can be reliably used as an alternate currency (as well as an investment).  The snails �� know that too-fast spikes (up or down) keep people wary, so the snails �� want it stable for a while, to entice more people in.  Although, ultimately the snails ��  are holding because they want (and they believe) that the value will go up.

@_date: 2019-07-11 02:10:03
Why are you?
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:52:54
yes, i started buying in nov 2017
bought nov 2017, it did well, bought more in december 2017, it was doing well
bought even more, it did well 
all the talk on here, and just about in all the bitcoin communities was that bitcoin was going to zig zag right on up to at least 40K (and the really bullish types were saying it could go as high as 80-100K)
Wow, sounds good, i thought.
then boom, the crash came.
everyone on here, and in the bitcoin community was saying "oh this dip is great, its only temporary, BUY THE DIP! its a great opportunity"
so, i did buy even some more when it first dipped in January 2018
but i was a deep, deep crash, deeper and longer than anyone had guessed it would be.
anyway, i was way down, so i said fuck it, these idiots don't know what they are talking about, everything they said is wrong.  literally everything.
so, i said fuck it, i am not going to keep buying the dip.  After january 2018, i never bought again (because i didnt want to, but i also i couldn't afford to anymore - i live by the only invest what you can afford to lose rule)
basically, i was down negative 80% at the worst of it.
even now i am down negative 20%
All my other investments (mainly funds that i have through Vanguard) have been making me about 8% a year.
So, during this same time period, they have done great.
So, not only did bitcoin lose me 20% of the money i put into it, if i didnt have it in bitcoin,  it would have been in vanguard making positive 8% or more return each year.
Anyway, i can't speak for anyone else, i am simply saying, FOR ME, bitcoin as an investment that has (even now) lost me 20% of what I put into it, is the worst investment of my life.
yes, i am will HODL what i originally bought, just in case.
But i will never buy any more bitcoin again, at least not until it makes me money (which it has never done, at least not since 2017)
you saying i'm a concern troll?  LOL
yeah right
i am a real invested, who lost 20% of my money that i put into bitcoin.
and i am not the only one. LOTS of us lost money on bitcoin.
But you bitcoin fan bois just freak out and attack anyone like me, who shares a simple truth, that many people have lost a lot of money on bitcoin, and that big losses can easily happen again and wipe everything out.

i bought a year and a half ago
i have been holding ever since
i have lost 40% of the money that i put into bitcoin
i know some people have made money off of it
but for me, its been the worst investment of my entire life
i have never bought any investment, and then 18 months later, have it be worth 40% less
all bitcoin did was lose me many thousands of dollars
you can down vote me or not, i'm just telling the truth.  i bought bitcoin, i HODL bitcoin, and all bitcoin has done (from practically day one) is lose, lose, lose money for me.

@_date: 2019-07-09 00:33:37
well, that's because they think that the recent spike in price is just temporary, and even though the price jump looks good now, especially to new-bees (and as such will attract a bunch of new money, making the price go even higher) it theorized that it will most likely come crashing down soon (especially as much of this new money is not going to HODL when price starts dropping a lot).  This will make the coming bear market, they believe, even worse.
Of course, not everyone thinks its a bear trap, but those people who think that there are rich whales who manipulate the market with pump &amp; dumps, tend to think that right now is a total bear trap.
Plus, many other observers think that the recent price rise will attract a bunch of new people who think its a bear market, but that it will soon crash ever harder, making them even bigger losers.
As for me, i personally think it *could be* a bear trap, 
...although its possible that its a solid market right now, and that all the ingredients are there for stable and continued growth.
just kidding, its a bear trap.  but hey, make a few bucks while you can, but be ready to pull it all out soon, or at the first sign of a drop, to avoid getting burned big time.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:46:47
sounds legit (maybe?)
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:58:31
a few days ago, when price started spiking, i was very clear
i said that this was just a pump and dump by whales
(i mean, think about it, a big spike with no real reason, and across all the main alts, too)
I predicted it would drop hard after a few days
and it did.  the way it dropped is further proof that i was right, that it was a pump and dump scheme by whales (it dropped by 10% or more, all at once, for no reason, and it dropped across all the top 5 or 6 alts, too, in about the same amount) 
why would it drop like that, all at once, for no reason, and across multiple coins?
even a market panic takes a few days to catch on across multiple crypto assets.
even an organic drop in one coin will take a day or so, to account for shifting markets and time zones.
but all the coins dropped by 10% or so, within a few hours of each other?
that can ONLY be a result of a HUGE series of sequential dumps (which is exactly what the whales did).
Anyway, I do hope that you all listened to me, and avoided this obvious (at least obvious to me) trap.
safe investing to you all!
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:53:08
no, as i predicted several days ago, we are going to go down to 7k
then the market will be flat, boring and depressing for a year (hovering mostly between 5k and 9k)
sometime in late 2020 it will start to slowly pick back up, but its going to be a bad year, and slow to recover.
sorry to be the bearer of bad news, please don't attack me, the messenger.

i can only speak for myself, but i bought bitcoin in late 2017.
i wound up losing MOST of what i put into it (I lost 75% of the money i invested)
bitcoin has inched up since then, but i am still down 25%.
its been a total drag to invest in bitcoin.  I am down in an investment that everyone else is talking about making money in.
oh well... i don't know what to tell you.  Personally, i am going to just HODL on to what i bought (but i am not that hopeful)
My honest non-expert opinion is that all the real money to be make from bitcoin has already happened, and most likely, there will be some slight gains to be had in the years ahead, but there is also a very likely risk that the whole thing crashes and goes to zero.
I would never recommend bitcoin to anyone to invest in, at this point its just a play-toy for billionaire pump-n-dump whales to manipulate and profit from.
As long as there are new suckers buying in, the whales will continue to manipulate/profit from bitcoin, but eventually they will run out of new suckers that want to invest in the volatile, money-losing bitcoin, and when that happens, its over and bitcoin crashes hard.
Anyway, hope that helps, and good luck in whatever you decide to invest in.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:30:43
but (i believe) incorrect
short term, this current correction will be a 50% correction
then, longer term...
in my opinion, all the real money to be make from bitcoin has already happened, and most likely, there will be some slight gains to be had in the years ahead, but movement will be mostly lateral, 
and of course, there is also a very likely risk that the whole thing crashes and goes to near-zero.
so anyone who invests now, will not make much, but will be risking everything for low returns.
anyway, i don't pretend i "know" for sure, that just my honest opinion.

I hope you're right.  the bitcoin i am hodling right now just sits there like a blob, and never seems to go up
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:49:59
ok, cool, thanks
good to know
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:24:18
a slight uptick
will it keep going up?
i am so tired of bitcoin being around $4K
i just wish it would go up to $20K (at least) once again.
Will this ever happen? or are we trapped forever at $4k forever?
@_date: 2019-03-18 20:58:29


 
why rush it? you just said it might not even go up in my lifetime
i don't care if future people get rich, i want to make some money off of bitcoin soon

@_date: 2019-03-17 18:32:19
oh, my condolences, that sucks.
well, I hope that it one day goes up again, so that you can be rich.
some people say it never will never go up again, others say it will.
i don't know, but i HOPE it does someday go up again, perhaps
@_date: 2019-03-16 04:21:08


it won't?
phew! thats good news
i know all of 2018 was a real drag, with bitcoin constantly going down.
i'm glad its reached the bottom, and just wish it would go up soon. i'm tired of waiting.

Even though Brutus was obviously guilty of murder and assassination, Marcus Aurelius pardoned him.
This unwise course of action led to years of war which ultimately led to the armies of Brutus attacking Rome.
Eventually Marcus Aurelius won, but it was years of senseless war all because Marcus refused to do anything (at the time) about a guilty, murderous snake who had just assassinated the emperor.
Marcus Aurelius was a weak leader, who did the wrong thing (more than once) and whose reign was the beginning of the end.
So, yes, I know the stoics love Marcus Aurelius, but get real, although he wrote one of the first self help books, ("Meditations") he wasn't all that great as a leader, and following his advice seems foolish at best.

i mean, if i had 2 btc and it went to 20K, that would be 72K dollars
that's more money than i make in 3 years
I just wish it would go up (to at least 20k), but it saddens me that it stays at 4K

Sadly, if bitcoin does go to the moon, there will be too much wealth in the hands of one user (or one group)
"Satoshi" will literally be wealthier than any country on the planet, and honestly... an anonymous person or group, having that much wealth and power is not necessarily a good thing, and could actually turn out rather poorly if they are not pure of heart.

imperialism is when you forcibly take over and control other countries
no one is forcing any other country into basing their economy on the US dollar
Every country is free to do whatever they want (at least they are free to do so without interference from the usa)
they can take part int he us dollar economy
they can make their own independent economy, they can become bitcoin based, or base their economy on any other form of currency
you see, its not imperialism is we are not forcing them, and they are (by free will) participating
seriously, did you not know that? you sound like one of those socialists who blame everyone and everything on some one else.

this is the greatest fallacy i ever heard, and i see it here all the time.
Let me explain it to you.
a guy buys a house for 1 million dollars cash.
after a year the house burns down to the ground and its totally gone.
He still owns the land, which is worth about 100K, but decided not to sell it for a few years.
this guy, standing on the land with the charred remains of his former home, did he lose anything?
yes, of course he did.
He lost $900k in equity.
Seriously, I dont get how people can't see this.
p.s. I appreciate your polite tone, and i dont meant to come across as snarky, its just that you have lost value whether you sell of not.  you are not gaining or losing when you sell, you are just changing which form you choose to hold your wealth in.
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:51:22

yes, you can say "BUY-BUY" to your money if you *buy* bitcoin
seriously... i know some people made money, but there are hundreds of thousands like me who just lost thousand because we bought it.
i wish everyone the best, and i hope YOU made money from it
sadly for me, i was a sucker who bought at the wrong time, and then listened to those who said to HODL
and now i lost 35% of my money
to some bitcoin is a dream come true, and it gave them wealth
to me, it was just money down the toilet.
My wish to everyone is that you do better than i did, I blew it big time!

dont listen to them, 
dont listen to me, either
just listen to your own heart.  
if your heart says to take a loan, then do it
you only live once, go for it
dont listen to others, just follow your heart and your emotions
dont think! just be in the moment and do whatever your heart tells you to.
dont think about it, just do it.

go for it.

Actually, wearing designer clothes, expensive sunglasses, gold jewelry, etc, actually is a sign that you are most likely poor.
Go to your typical poor neighborhood, and you'll see plenty of losers wearing expensive clothes and shoes, driving mercedes, all while living in poverty in their mother's basements.
Here where i live (los angles) poor guys will even rent lambos or other luxury cars for the evening, so they can go to "da club" and play-pretend that they are rich.
but come Monday, they are broke again, and back to work at their job at Mcdonalds (or in some cases, they dont even have jobs, and they are just on welfare).

not really, they say not to invest more than you can afford to lose
after seeing my bitcoin investment lose nearly 80% of its value, i could nt afford to put more money in
besides, i didn't want to put good money after bad
sure, if you time it just right you can make money, but time it wrong and you could lose near all
i guess i'm "lucky" to have *only* lost 40-45% of the money i put into bitcoin
Yes, i will HODL
but but more of this turkey investment?  No, i will pass
its been nothing but  huge money loser for me.

but i can only tell the truth
and the truth is that it will go down to 8k soon
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:49:35
yes, it's easy.
if youre a person living in a third world country like Ghana, the process is the same.  Just contact any number of reputable investment companies (and yes, they even have offices in Ghana - but you can also do this online, too) and set up investments in various stocks and bonds and other western investments.
Personally, I would recommend using Vanguard and also Charles Schwab is good, too.
Of course, having a diversified portfolio could involve investing in bitcoin as well (which someone could do through one of the online companies like coinbase, or you could even just cold store bitcoin investments on a ledger device)
The point is, diversify, and have most of your investment in things that are outside of the country, and not based on the local currency.
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:09:27
yes, exactly
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:37:21
When you are from a country that has a type of money that no one else has ever heard of (such as "cedis") then for God's sake, invest OUTSIDE of your country.
Nothing against the people of Ghana (in fact, the ones I've met have been super nice).  I'm just saying, if you live in a third world country - especially if you live in sub-Saharan Africa, and you have some money to invest, then invest most of it in more stable places like the USA, the EU or Japan, etc.  
In other words, my advice to people in poorer/less developed/third world countries is to get your wealth out of the country if you live in a country, especially one that is unstable, or excessively corrupt.
@_date: 2019-08-22 22:10:39

only problem is, in early technologies like email, the inventors of that technology might have gotten rich, but those who first used email aren't rich now.
if that happens to bitcoin (what happened to email or HTTP, etc) then the value of bitcoin will just go down to near nothing, and those of us who bought bitcoin now will lose everything we invested in it 
Others will use it, but there is no (financial) benefit in being an early investor in bitcoin, in fact... if you're an early investor/user of bitcoin, you're just gonna lose all your money so that others in the future can have a new/better technology
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:08:53

ok, can you say "out of touch with the common man"?
@_date: 2019-08-30 06:46:03
no, you are wrong
i am actually down, when i do the math, about negative 45%
i lost 45% of the money that I put into bitcoin
Nonetheless, how dare you falsely accuse me of lying.
i mean, think about it, bitcoin was as high as 20k
its now in the 9ks
how can you not see how someone could easily be down 50%
I have only bought, never sold or traded, and i have only HODL
but i am down, 45%
others are down over 50% (depending upon when they bought)
Yes, I know many made money, too (not me, and not many others though)
But to stupidly claim that someone cant be down 50%???
Why would YOU do that?
Follow along:
ATH was 20K 
if someone bought below that at 18K, and then HODL then they could be down 50%
or someone who bought little bits when it was as low as 7K, then more and more when it was 17K and 18K and 19K  (but never bought at the ATH) but just decided to HODL, they could be down 50%
LOL 
Seriously, do i have to explain everything to you???
there are plenty of ways to have bought not at the ATH and still be down 50%
seriously (nothing personal) but maybe just maybe, you need to buy a calculator, there Einstein?
wow, you never learned "the maths" did you???
You do know what "%" means, right?
You might consider going back to 4th grade math, and learn how what 50% is, OK?
Good luck, see you next year!
I mean, no disrespect, but you started off implying what I said wasn't true...
So i wasn't going to just sit there and accept those accusations.  Nope.
I tell the truth, so perhaps you should check yourself before falsely accusing me again, OK?
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:36:02

if you are investing less than 1M, then you are a small fish, and the markets are designed to take as much from you as they can.
and if you are some guy just investing a thousand or two, here or there, then a highly speculative, volatile market like BTC is designed to just take all it can from you,  BTC investing is being promoted to make billionaire pump and dumpers billions in profits from one small investor after another

i still think it will go to $8k, but i guess we'll all wait and see???
@_date: 2019-08-30 08:07:40
thanks for the kind words.
to answer your question, i did start learning in summer of 2017 (because everyone said learn the basics before buying)
by late october i started buying bitcoin in small amounts, just to learn how to buy and get used to it.
as i continued to learn, i also listened to all the experts in 2017 who were almost universally saying (just as people said on here) that bitcoin was going to go to 40k at least, and could even go to 100k
So, i continued to buy, and price just kept going up, so i bought more.
when it finally peaked at 20k, and then crashed, nearly everyone was screaming "buy the dip" so I kept buying in January 2018.
by February, i realized that i was fucked, and stopped buying sometime in february 2018.
I still listened to others who said to HODL (which was another mistake) and i watched the price go down to 3k
I did realize that i cant time the market, and i also realized that I might as well just HODL
And since I am not one to put good money after bad, i decided to never buy bitcoin again.
If it makes me money one day, that'll be cool
But i cant time the market or "buy low" as I dont know if i'll ever know when "low" is, or when it will go up.
I'll never buy again, but i'll just HODL onto what i currently have (worth 35% less than when i bought it - hey, could be worse, at one point it was  worth 70% less than what i cost to buy)
Price just seems to be going down even more lately, oh well.  :(
I never bought more than i could afford to lose, but "afford" it or not, to lose 35% of an investment in less than 2 years is a total drag! (even worse is that my other investments, Vanguard funds of stocks and bonds, have gained about 15% or more, in the last same 2 years).  
Personally, I dont see it going up to the ATH anytime in the next year (perhaps it never will).
So, I'm stuck HODLing, and hoping one day it'll come back up. (i cant see ever making back what that money would have been worth if i had just put it into Vanguard or another investment fund - but i role the dice, and lost, it happens)
The only real lesson I learned is to NEVER listen to the experts (they were the most wrong of all)
If i had just made the bitcoin buying decision on my own, and lost 35% of my money i could have been like, oh well... I at least tried to follow my own intuition, and it didn't work out.
But its even worst that i was so dumb as to listen to the bitcoin "experts" who (even now) predict it will go to the moon.  Never listen to experts in regard to bitcoin
Just do your own thing, buy or dont buy based on what you feel is best.
Personally, it feel like a suckers bet, and little more than gambling (where the real winners are pump and dump whales, and the losers are all regular working class hard working people like us on here)
The experts are also trying to get rich off us, but they are just doing the bidding of the whales, and in most cases the experts are even dumber than the dumbest of us (people like me)
be careful, you have a better shot at a casino, and at least they'll give you free drinks as you lose your money.
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:07:34
seriously, what the fuck is going on?
this is insane
it just keeps going down.  
is there any reason for this?
it just won't stop.
ugh! so annoying!
seriously, we were stable for  awhile, then it just decides to spend a month losing 30% of its value
...and its still crashing.
@_date: 2019-08-31 00:28:09
you come on here to insult me, and to tell me what to do?
sorry, you're not my boss
and also...

thats against the TOS here
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:51:43
i just wish all my money didnt zoom out
i hate losing thousands of dollars to bitcoin, this sucks!
Its been two years since i started buying, and i am still way down
lost 50% of th e money i put into it
worst mistake i ever made to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:11:55
iit doesn't seem like its going to go down to 8k by the end of august exactly as i predicted
but i did predict this crash.
when i predicted it would crash down, btc was around 12K, i believe, and what is it now? in the 9ks
oh well... it sucks, but there were many of us who saw it coming.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see, but I still think we're heading down to 8k before anything even thinks going up again.
this year is going to be VERY rough for btc and those of us hodling
but if you can make it till the end of 2020, there might be some light at the end of the tunnel

/s ruins the joke /s
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:07:06


as did millions of others
its a terrible investment (for anyone who bought from late 2017 onward)
and i dont think it will ever be a truly good investment again, but hey... you never know?
it could go to 3k and stay there fro yers, although i do hope it goes back up again, one day ...hopefully (although i am not counting on  it)
@_date: 2019-08-31 06:02:18
started buying 2 years ago
so yes, anyone who started two years ago, or more recently, is gonna get fucked

i have actually had MANY predictions that have been correct
i am 100% percent accurate the far
i am not sure if i am a genius, or have ESP, or maybe i'm just lucky?
but whatever the case, thus far, i have always been correct
i guess we'll see if what i have been predicting for weeks (that bitcoin will hit 8k in mid Augst) turns out to be yet another one of my accurate predictions???
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:16:03
Since your question is actually just a thinly veiled insult (and not a real question) I am unable to answer.
My only advice is to learn to be more loving and kind to your fellow humans here on this planet.  That would be the "super-smart" thing for you to do, if you wish to find happiness.
@_date: 2019-08-31 06:03:26
calling a fool and a troll wasn't an insult?
wow, well if that wasn't an insult, i'd sure hate to hear what was!!!
i don't mind you sharing your opinion, but literally calling me a fool and a troll was an insult, to me!
as for 


just trying to enlighten the newbees especially.  I just wish someone had warned me like this when i started, Two years ago when i joined the overall bitcoin community, EVERYONE, especially the experts, were saying it would keep going up to 40K at least.
I believed all the nonsense, and invested, i just wish there were less "to the moon" types (who all turned out to be wrong) and more "its a long shot and might likely go down to 3k this year" types (which is what actually happened the year i got into this whole thing).
Oh, well, i learned by losing 35% or more of my money, i just want to warn others that its a total gamble, and getting screwed out of near-everything you put into it is just as likely as making money.  I want others lo learn through my wisdom, and truth sharing, so that they dont have to lose wealth like i did.
the golden days are over, from here on out its slow, slow, slow profits, if you make anything.  and you put a lot at risk to just make a tiny bit.
So, i am just putting out a message that i dont see on here much, to be helpful and to give the full range of intelligent opinions, and not just the "lambo, moon, buy the dip" nonsense
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:41:09
i politely disagree
i said it would go up and down a bit, but then that, by sometime in mid/late August, it would be $8K
and since i am always correct, yes... that is what will happen, it will be in the 8Ks in August
i repeatedly said is would "bart" up and down? and THEN it would settle into the 8Ks?
oh well... no prob, so best wishes to you!
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:29:08

yes, i agree, it sucks
i just want to not lose so much money
i hate this!
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:27:43
because i long ago decided to just HODL
i've said this many times this year
i don't buy
i dont sell
i just HODL
and i will never buy bitcoin again
buying bitcoin was the biggest money losing mistake of my life
i'll never make that mistake again
 
 
@_date: 2019-08-04 22:20:00
there are some (like me) who are great at predicting the future (i didnt ask for this gift, it just comes to me through intuition)
but you are correct for most, they cannot predict the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-30 06:03:21
hey, who knows? at this rate my prediction of it being in the 8ks in August might happen after all
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:26:11
yes, i am exactly correct
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:12:15

just do what your heart tells you

@_date: 2019-08-30 18:22:25
short term?
i've bene HODLing for two years
and down 35%
i am afraid by next year i'll be down even more, 50% negative perhaps
my other investments make ma bout 8% a year, so up over 16% over two years.
on the other hand, BTC not only doest even make money, it loses it
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:42:00
i respect you sharing your opinion
and i ask that you show me the same respect of allowing me to share my opinion freely
i mean, i haven't shared my opinion in about 2 weeks, so its not like i share it endlessly
but me sharing my opinion once a week or so seems fine.
so, i will respectfully share my opinion and allow you to do you the same.
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:24:15
sure, if someone has unlimited stable income coming in, then sure... its more likely to make money on bitcoin 
although, personally, i think that even since late 2017, bitcoin's been mostly a dud, and the days of truly being able to make money from it are gone, in my opinion.
its a gamble, i mean, it might go to 20K again, then again it could go to 3k and stay there for years
might be  terrible move to tie up your money in bitcoin, when it could be making a steady 6-8% every year in other stable investments
@_date: 2019-08-05 07:19:35
I neither confirm nor deny being a non-human

in that case, go with Vanguard
Even Merrill Lynch is pretty good (fees are a little higher than Schwab or Vanguard, though)
To get a good list of recommended investment companies, i recommend you check out a subreddit on here called r/personalfinance
but you should have money invested in more secure companies if you are currently living in a third world country, or a corrupt country, or somewhere with a currency that most people dont know of.
Also, besides diversifying in a secure fund, consider putting some of your money into a crypto currency such as bitcoin.  If you do this, just make sure you avoid the shady or untested exchanges, and buy from reputable crypto exchanges.  Personally, i recommend buying on coinbase pro (but do your own research, and buy wherever you feel is best for you).

but will your phone catch HPV from the stripper?
@_date: 2019-08-30 00:22:27
wrong, 
when i started buying in small amounts it was about 7K
then i slowly started buying more and more 
even after it hit 20k and then crashed, people kept saying "buy the dip" when it was at 17 and 18K
so i did
anyway, looking at the total amount i put into bitcoin, and what its worth now, i lost about half of my money
i just want it to go up again, but it seems not to
i just want to at least break even
speaking ONLY for myself, buying bitcoin was the biggest money losing experience of my life
@_date: 2019-02-09 05:08:42
how much?
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:46:38


i'd be happy with a 5% return, sadly i am at a negative 80% return right now
anyway, as i wait, i would love to make some money off these new bees, i just don't know how, any suggestions?
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:19:04
in 2018 etc went from 20K to 4K
so, i don't really care about these little 10% spikes, or 8% drops in 2019
until btc is back to 20K, its all just a bear market.  will it ever get out of the current bear market? yes, eventually, but will take years (2 years at least, perhaps longer)

ok, this Kool but i don't know enough to do that
but (after having bitcoin for about 18 months now)i do know more than some guy who just buying his first btc right now
so, how can i make money off all these new bees that are coming in?  I might not know much, but i know more than them.
people who were around longer than me (when i started) make a lot of money off of me.  Now i want to be like that, and make money off the new people coming in.
any suggestions on how to do that?  I have a few possible ideas, but really... i am hoping the community might have some ideas as well.
so, bitcoin amigos, what can i do to make money off these new bees?

in regard to letting things ride, or getting out...
what would you advice someone who bought a bunch of btc a little over a year ago, and now its only worth 20% of what I originally paid?
should I sell now (with the price being 80% less than I originally paid) and just cut my losses?  or hold on to what i have, even though its gone down so much, and hope it goes back up again one day?
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:51:02


yes, that was what I was wondering, too?
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:17:05
wow, thats good to know
so, i get your point about a slow decline, but will bitcoin ever go up high again?  to $12K or higher at some point?
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:38:28
i like that, are you sure it will go back to $12k though?

@_date: 2019-02-24 19:43:58

and if so, when?
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:58:35


about bitcoin? 
thanks for asking, but not good.
i am still feeling it was a waste of my money
i am still in the hole, and its still been a money loser for me
sure, if it goes to $15K or so, i'll break even.
it might go that high, then again it might crash again.
so, for now... its been a total money-loser for me still.
so, as before, i am not counting on making my money back

so, i have no intention of trying to explain anything, and if you say something, i'll take you at your word.
once again, my apologies, and i have no evidence that my ancestors owned slaves, but i am still 100% in favor of reparations, and i think that all white Americans should pay the price for hundreds of years of slavery and prejudice.
thank you for setting me straight, yes (youre correct) i was being racist, and i will try to check my privilege from here on out.

thats true, it might crash, or a quantum computer could figure out how to crack the encryption, and then it would go to zero

i live in the USA, but i have to agree with you 100% (at least thats been the case since Donald "orange man" Trump was elected.)
as for your comment about African nations, don't be racist, they are only doing poorly because they were harmed by european colonizers who destroyed there economies!
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:47:42
welp, that was over quickly
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:59:35
i hope youre right
when is bitcoin going up again?
i am down negative 80%, i wonder when i'm going t make money on this?
thus far, its the worst investment I have ever made, but people keep telling me to hodl (i do, but it keeps going down)
will it ever go up again? cause this sucks!
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:49:52
oh, i did dca
but i'm still in negative territory
i hope that bitcoin comes back to 20k though
@_date: 2019-02-09 00:51:12
well, at least they can have the experience of having some money for a while, and even if it goes back to the rich, we can redistribute it to the poor once again
i'd rather the poor have the money some of the time, which is why we need higher taxes on the rich, and estate and wealth taxes too
@_date: 2019-02-25 08:22:44
i'll hold, but i know some people are making money off the new bees, i just wanna be one of them
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:26:07
serious question, i bought a bunch of BTC in 2018, and then it went down in price 80% after I bought
a bunch of people got rich by cashing out after newly arriving investors like me came in and bought bitcoin
i've now been in a little over a year, and there are new people coming in to BTC, what can I do to get rich off of them?
whats the best way to profit off the new people who are coming in? Right now I am down 80% and I'd love to figure out some way, any way, for me to enrich myself off all these new people coming in, any suggestions? 
@_date: 2019-02-09 16:50:52


sure, that could happen, but then again, look at MOST billionaires, they jut lay about on their piles of money, not doing anything, hoarding wealth, and using way more than their fair share of natural resources.
i mean, some billionaire in NYC can live in a huge building, all to himself, while there are people blocks away literally starving to death.  why the fuck are we not wealth taxing that billionaire to feel and shelter those truly in need?  Not to mention, billionaires like the Koch brothers fly around in private jets and yachts, all while the world around is is being destroyed by global climate change.  Why are we allowing that.
Fck these rich fuckers, almost everything bad on the planet is because of then

what's a DCA?
@_date: 2019-02-10 01:03:01
it did not got to 12K
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:37:04
ok, that makes sense
oh well, i still wish i did know
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:45:03
yes, thats too bad, i would love to make money off the new bees, the way that the people that were here before me got rich off my money
@_date: 2019-02-09 00:15:42
yup, YOLO
@_date: 2019-02-24 21:23:43


but why are the wall street guys the ONLY ones who can make money off of the new bees?
isn't there a way a regular guy like me can make money off the new bees too?
p.s. i am not so much looking to get into trading, i just want to figure out ways to make money off the new bees that are just coming in, they know less that I do, and i'd love to figure out some way to get a piece of the money they are bringing in.
lots of other people are making money off the new bees (and have been for some time) I want to be one of those kinds of people, who make money off the new bees (i am just not sure how to do it, so i am reaching out to the community and asking for help)
@_date: 2019-02-21 16:49:09
yes, it sucks to be in America right now, I hate this place (not because I hate America always, i just hate living in a place that was so dumb and racist that they voted for orange idiot).
luckily, i live in california, so we ALL pretty much hate orange idiot here, and its not so bad being in one of the few decent parts of the otherwise racist USA
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:58:12


ok, but its already gone down 80%
is it going to go up again? or is it going to keep going down?
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:41:25
will it stay up?
or will it crash back down?
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:26:34
wow, that was smart
i bought bitcoin a little over a year ago
i lost 80% of what i put in
i wish (now) that i had been wise like you and pulled out when it was high
now that its just 20% of what i put in, i guess i'll just hold and hope that it goes up again one day.
oh well... my loss.
but i will admit, i am totally jealous of you, i just wish i was half as smart as you were.
@_date: 2019-02-09 11:46:25
saying what?

which one of those three do you think is MOST likely?
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:33:30


you don't?
ok, youre in denial, trump is the most dangerous leader and could possibly lead to destruction of the planet by his lack of action on climate change
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:04:14
cool, i hope it hits 10K soon
do you know when it will?
@_date: 2019-02-09 00:54:23
sure, for example, i know a lot of college kids can run one in their dorm room, and the university pays the cost
same thing with people in government housing, often it comes with utilities included
basically, if you live somewhere where you don't have to pay the electric bill, then you can do mining with zero electricity cost (to yourself)
let someone else pay the electric bill, and make money off the the mining.
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:40:18
hey, you only live once, go for it.
put everything you can borrow into buying bitcoin, you'll either become rich
or just go bankrupt and start over if it fails
@_date: 2019-02-09 05:06:23
exactly up, or exactly down?

btc ended 2017 at around $20k
btc ended 2018 at around $4k (and is currently lower than that at around $3900)
he says that bitcoin is on an "upward trajectory" and that it will finish 2019 at around $5k
and I guess, technically going from $4k to $5k is upward.
Still, i doesn't seem *that* upward, and (perhaps) not yet time to get excited quite yet.
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:29:05
thus far, i've only been "rewarded" by losing 80% of the money i put into bit coin
but hey.. if you guys say hODL and i'll be rewarded one day, then I'll do as you say.
I'm down 80%, but I'm gonna HODL and hope for the best.  I hope you fellows who say it will go up again one day are correct.
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:35:47
sure, bet it all, see what happens
you got nothing to lose buy money, and you can get more of that
either way, you learn something
and you might just wind up being a bitcoin billionaire
i say go for it
@_date: 2019-02-24 21:05:52


yes, i got that, and i am not even companying about it
i am just saying, i want to do that too! the way that people made money off of me when i was a new bee, i want to figure out a way that i can do that to the new bees that are coming in now.
it seems like a natural thing (the more experienced people making money off the new people coming in).  I just want to get in and be one of the people making money off of these new bees.  Knowing that some of the new bees will be buying/selling bases on emotions, how can i take advantage of their emotions to make myself wealthy?   I am not sure how to do it, but if anyone has any ideas on how i can enrich myself off the new bees, i'm all ears, let  me know.
@_date: 2019-02-25 04:45:44
well, either way, i am just hoping to make a bunch of money off the new bees
any suggestions on how to do that?
@_date: 2019-02-09 00:56:12
is this going to stay up?
or is it going to crash back down?

which one?
@_date: 2019-04-04 06:03:09
but wasn't it $5k like 6 months ago?  
going to 5K, isn't that like just going back to where it was last oct/nov?
seems like we have (all in all) just mostly gone downward for 2018 and even this year has not been good (at least that's what my memory tells me)
but yes, if i am wrong, please let me know
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:55:43
what's your problem?
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:34:07
Bitcoin has been going down (overall) for the last year pretty badly.
and then it does go down like it does today (right now its down 7%) there is always someone who says:  *"oh i'm happy its going down, now i can buy more"*
well, maybe its just me, but I AM NOT HAPPY IT WENT DOWN.  In fact, I just wish it would go up (and no not just little pump and dump mini-spikes).  I just wish it could go up in a real and powerful way, and then be able to hold that position.
sigh, oh well... i guess thats not going to happen this time.
one day (i hope).
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:41:55


oh i don't worry about everyone else's gains and losses
i just know that i bought bitcoin, and then have hodl onto it ever since i bought it
and i lost 60% of the money that i put into it.  
I don't blame anyone else but myself, i simply said that I have been patiently holding for over a year, and my money is WAY DOWN.
so, i just pointed out how i wish that it would go up again, ideally it would go to $20k at least
I've been patient, and i will continue to be, but its taking forever, and it sucks to wait and see a crash after every little bump upward.
ANYWAY... THAT WAS ME JUST SHARING MY OPINION, and yet... just for sharing that opinion, some people (not you) are attacking or insulting me.
Arent i allowed to have my own opinion?
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:19:31
if you don't like money, and if having too much money is your problem, then yes, buy bitcoin, lots of it
and problem solved, all your money will be gone in no time.
i mean, i can ONLY speak for myself, but in the end of 2017 i bough a bunch of bitcoin, and now nearly 75% of the money that i put into bitcoin is gone.  Oh well... i know it was a gamble.  I played, and lost (at least thus far).  I am hodling, so i guess time will tell.
Personally, i am not expecting to ever see my money (that i put into bitcoin) again... but hey, you never know.  IF bitcoin ever comes back up again to $20k or higher, I'll be pleasantly and unexpectedly surprised.
good luck!
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:53:47
i am not against it going up $1000
i was simply saying, my presence is that it would go up to $20k again (or at least go up to $10K)
but just staying below or near $5K is getting boring, and depressing.
I just shared my opinion, thats all.
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:44:32


yes, i know i was dumb to buy bitcoin.  i won't make that mistake again, ever.
but i am going to hodl what i did buy back then, and hey... IF it ever goes higher than $20k again, i can maybe make my money back?
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:52:42
yes, well my present day self has lost 60% of the money that i put into bitcoin
so, i would like to at least break even in the present day, before worrying about future me
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:57:47


yes most of my investments are in Vanguard funds (before that, i invited with Merrill Lynch)
basically every year i make between 2% (on the rare bad year) or 6% up in value on the average year, and there have been years where my stock investments are up over 10%
but on average, my stocks go up about 6% or 7% a year.
Its not enough to retire on, but its a nice return.
Even the money i just have in a regular bank savings account pays me 2.25% interest.
on the other hand, i did try to invest some money in bitcoin, i only invested what i could afford to lose, but i did hope it would go up n value.
but bitcoin? its only returned a negative 60% on the money that i put into it.
i knew it was a risk, and i willingly took that chance, and i only blame myself, and yes... i am hodling, hoping it will one day go back up.
but, there is no comparison, for me, between secure stocks (the closest thing to guaranteed returns) and bitcoin (which, speaking ONLY for myself, has been nothing but a HUGE money loser).
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:59:49
yes, wanting to help the poor (i.e. socialism) is soooo bad

that sounds like stupid ass American trump voters
all a bunch of idiots
we have lost the country to their stupid racist white supremacy
and the us will be like a modern day version of 1930s germany and the handmaids tale if progressives don't win in 2020
but hey... not like that election is important or anything
heck, i don't care, if the economy crashes down, better for me, i have bitcoin, and i'll do fine, its just the low information trump voters who will be crying "what happened?"
and begging me for help. but i'll just laugh in their faces.
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:22:04


yes please, that would be amazing.
i mean, all i know is that i bought biotin at around $20k
and now, as its at $5K, people are telling me that this is great?
Maybe its just my opinion, but a 75% loss is not great to me.
but hey.... i guess some people think that $5k is great (I'm just not one of those people)
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:14:56


weren't we just at $5K a few months ago?
getting to $5k, which is where we were just last november, doesn't feel like a "major victory" to me
plus, considering that $5k is only 25% of what it was in early 2018, i am not counting this as any sort of victory
i mean... sure, its still better than what it was doing before, just endlessly going down in price.
but we really have set the bar low if we are going to start saying that $5k is some sort of major victory
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:50:39
oh, i already lost so much value (thus far) i figure I might a well hodl
so much value is gone, it can really only go up.
I am not counting on bitcoin going up, i have just written it off as a bad investment choice (at this point)
but hey, if i am wrong, and if bitcoin goes up to 20k or more again, then i'll be pleasantly surprised.
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:49:00
yes, that wasn't my plan, but in actual practice, that's what i did
oh well... I don't think any real investors have to worry about me
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:58:16
first of all, calling fellow users "trolls" is an offense that can get you banned.
I won't report you this time, but call me names and personally insult me again and i will report you to the mods.
seriously dude, just be polite, talk about bitcoin, no reason to start with name calling and accusations
got it? good.
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:18:56
correct, i am kinda new.
i started following it in mid 2017, and by the end of 2017 I started to buy bitcoin.
and yes, it was going up when i bought, but then right after that, it crashed, and has never come up again (as long as I have owned it, that is).
I do hope it comes back up one day.  As it stands right now, i bought bitcoin, and then it went down, down, down.  I lost 75% in value of what i bought in late 2017 and early 2018.
Bitcoin has been a huge financial loss for me, I am still hodling, and I do hope that one day it might finally come back up for me.
There are some people who say that bitcoin will one day be at $20K again.  personally i have no idea if it ever will, but i sure HOPE they are correct!
@_date: 2019-04-09 00:33:00
yeah, its so "cringe" to care about poor people OVER the wealthy one percent
whatever you say, greedy capitalists, you KNOW soooo much more than us people who actually care about others
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:45:51
i am being patient
i am hodling, this year, i lost 60% of the money that i put into bitcoin, and i'm still hodling, so thats about as patient as you can get
@_date: 2019-04-20 04:17:10
nope, i am chillAF
i am even happier now that Mueller has shown EVEN MORE of Trumps crimes
this is gonna be a great 2 years, of impeaching Trump
Of course, I only mention this because you brought up politics, but I do believe Trump is not a good president, and i am glad the legal teams are going after him
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:49:00


not me.
i bought, and then i hodl my bitcoin
all thats happened is that i lost about 60% of the money that i put into bitcoin
i don't blame anyone but myself, i was simply sharing my opinion that
@_date: 2019-04-05 21:53:51
personally insulting me again?
its nothing to do with me being "delicate"
its just that this subreddit starts to suck when people on here (like you) just use it to personally insult and call others names.
i have reported you to the mods.
@_date: 2019-04-04 01:43:29
yes, even though i know better, i was tempted to buy when i saw the price going up.
oh course, i am not a total idiot, so i didn't fall for it.  i will hodl what i have (might as well, at this point) but buy more bitcoin? no, i don't think i will ever do that again.  I learned that lesson the hard way.
i won't be fooled into buying bitcoin again.
but hey, anyone who does want to buy it, go for it, its your money, i wish you the best.
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:04:08
i can only judge it from the time i started investing in it
yes, i am going to hodl what i already bought
but since i started buying bitcoin, i lost 60% of the money i put into bitcoin.
i'll wait it out, but to tell the truth, i am already mentally detaching from all the money i put into bitcoin, and i am just going to think of it as lost anyway, never to come back again.
i don't think bitcoin will ever recover, but hey..
if it does somehow, someday, magically recover, I'll be pleasantly surprised (i'm just not counting on it to do so)
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:42:40


i am not smart enough to know when the top is (for example, when i did buy practically everyone on here was saying it would go to $40k at least on that run)
so, i (now) know that I can't tell when to buy is.  so, i will never buy any more bitcoin again.  on the other hand, i am just going to hodl what i have now, and hopefully if it ever goes to 20K or higher again, I'll make my money back (and maybe even profit)
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:27:38
thanks! 
and i hope you're correct
in actual numbers, all bitcoin has done for me is lose 75% of the money that i put into it
here's to hoping you are right, and that bitcoin will once again go up to $20k and higher soon
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:12:27
i am not sure its settling yet, its still falling down in price, from what i can tell
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:53:03
no, after i lost 60% of what i put into bitcoin, i swore i would never buy bitcoin again
and i won't.
its been a terrible investment, but just to be safe (in case it ever does go up again one day) i am still going to hodl onto what i already own.
but buy more bitcoin? LOL
nooooo, i will never do that.  i am not buying any more bitcoin again.  Any investment that loses 60% of its total value in just one year is not an investment that I am ever going to invest in again.
@_date: 2019-04-20 03:26:59
oh, just be quiet, please
@_date: 2019-04-05 20:08:44
oh, what line of work are you in?
 if its crypto related you can maybe engrave your name and number and email on the coins, and then give them out as "business cards"
@_date: 2019-04-12 05:48:32
personally insulting fellow members of the r/bitcoin community is against the rules of this subreddit.
please, talk about bitcoin, or related topics, but personal insults and name calling? that is not allowed.
i have reported you to the mods, hopefully they will be able to put an end to insult comments like yours.
either way, please read the rules of this subreddit before posting again.
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:23:06
thats ok, I don't care if its stable
i mean, stable is nice, but either way... if we could just get to $20K any possible way, I would be MUCH happier
@_date: 2019-04-20 04:21:39
no, its pretty awesome
sure, having bad president sucks, but at least i am not a Trump supporter
and i have friends that are against his oppression, too.

will it happen?
i don't think so.
but hey... fingers crossed.
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:39:16


yes, my first choice would be to go up and stay up
but heck, given the choice of staying at $5K
OR... to at least temporarily go up to $20K
I'll take a temporary rise to $20K over just being stagnant and stuck at $5K
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:31:22
what do you need help with?
@_date: 2019-04-04 01:30:40
welp... that ended quickly
oh well, it was nice while it lasted.
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:26:13
wow, why so hostile?
i mean, i admitted that in late 2017 I made a dumb move and bought an asset that i didn't know much about, thinking it it would go up in value.
that was dumb of me.  Since then, i have become smart enough to know that I shouldn't buy assets like bitcoin that I don't totally and fully understand.
I am educating myself, but until I am fully educated in bitcoin and crypto (which could take years) I won't buy any more.
so yes, I did do something dumb like buying bitcoin in late 2017, after I listened to the people on here in 2017 that said bitcoin would keep going up.  They were wrong and i was too undereducated (at that time) to know any better.  I definitely made an unwise choice in my actions then.
but that was back then, now i am smart enough to not take any investment advice from any people i don't personally know, including those who are on here.
Having said that, most people on here are super nice and helpful, and its a wonderful community, and I am glad to learn from almost everyone on here.  I appreciate all that they share and how they are smart and helpful
Of course, there are a few rude people, but they are rare on here, so I just laugh at their comments whenever someone like that tries to personally insult me (when all I am doing is being on here talking respectfully about bitcoin)
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:06:16
i'm only doing it wrong if it goes back up to $20k
i am smart enough to know that i personally have no idea what the future bitcoin price will be
and last time i listened to people on here, I bought at $20k (because it was definitely going up to $40k at least)
Back then I didn't know enough to know that was bad advice, and I don't have any desire to trust a stranger's investment advice now, either.
I no longer take financial advice from strangers, and i am (now) smart enough to know i personally shouldn't risk my money on bitcoin ever again.
i made my mistake, but I'll hodl on to what i bought
if it goes up, then sure... i can break even, or even make money.
but after losing 75% of the money that i already put into bitcoin taught me enough so that I won't make that mistake again.
I'm just gonna sit back, watch, and see what happens, and as i do I will not be risking any more of my money in an investment that's already lost me 75% of what i put into it (and nope, i won't buy anymore bitcoin just because some strangers on the internet - even if they are well intentioned - say that now is a good time!)
@_date: 2019-04-12 00:11:23


yes, its had some peaks and valleys
but as i said, i can't speak for everyones gains and losses, I am simply saying, in the 17 or so months that i started buying bitcoin, i am down 60%.
60% of the money that i put into bitcoin is now gone.  although,  i was down over 70% before.
so, yes... being negative 60% is not as bad as when i was negative 70%
still, until bitcoin is up to $20k ..or at LEAST $10K, I won't be happy.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:31:46
yes, i did just look, right now bitcoin is down 7% right now
and it seems otherwise pretty flat
was this latest "bull run" just us (once again) getting suckered into another whale pump and dump?
i just wish it would go up again, like when it was at $20k, but (correct me if I'm wrong) but it does seem like its just going to go down even more, or stay flat again.
sigh, this is so annoying.  even when you think it might go up for real, it just seems to fizzle out.
@_date: 2019-04-04 01:39:56
yes what you say makes sense
when i bought bitcoin the first time in late 2017 i didn't know much about it
but i bought it, and yes... i was not smart enough to know better.
so, i wound up losing nearly 70% of the money i put into bitcoin.  I decided to hold, and i am still holding.  
These days, with this temporary bump, and some slight upticks since the bottom of 2018, i am now at about (almost) 50%
So, i still cant feel good about losing half my money, but hey, at least its better than losing 70% of my money 
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:56:32
oh, thanks.  i still have much to learn, so your helpful explanation clarifies things
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:55:33
you can call it mad mania, or whatever you want
but whatever it is that makes it go up to $20k and higher, thats what I want again
i am not saying it will, i was just sharing my personal preference that it go up to $20K or at LEAST back up to $10K
but just endlessly hovering at near or below $5K is boring and depressing.  i don't like it.
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:59:30
first of all, calling fellow users "trolls" is an offense that can get you banned.
So is saying things like "you weren't smart enough not to do dumb shit " (which is also something you said to me)
I won't report you this time, but call me names and personally insult me again and i will report you to the mods.
seriously dude, just be polite, talk about bitcoin, no reason to start with name calling and accusations
got it? good.

@_date: 2019-01-26 01:50:58


thanks for the kind words, and its not so much that i lost money in bitcoin, i can forgive myself for that (as you said, it happened to thousands of other people, too).  Its just that i haven't succeeded in ANY of the important areas of my life, in any measurable way, and time is running out for me (i'm getting old) so basically i am a loser (that part is without a doubt) I do HOPE that i can turn things around, but will that happen? I don't see how, but hey... you never know, maybe i will figure it out, how to NOT be a loser after all??
hope so!
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:02:35
bitcoin just hovers under $4K
no real movement or growth,  following bitcoin day to day is boring (and depressing)
not saying you shouldn't hold, but just coming on here and talking about it... feels bad, man.
best to just walk away, hope for the best, and then come back in a few months and hope its gone up.
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:16:55
why would anyone pay 8-10% ?
unless you need to launder your money, which doesn't apply to 99% of the people who buy bitcoin.
I'm no expert, but giving away up to 10% of your money in fees seems silly to me
Nonetheless, people are doing it, does anyone know why people are spending 8-10% in transaction fees at bitcoin ATMs when they could buy the same amount of bitcoin online and not pay those kind of high fees?
@_date: 2019-01-21 04:56:38
if you say so, i believe you, but if someone is too unstable to even open a bank account, then perhaps they should take care of that FIRST, before buying crypto assets?

@_date: 2019-01-18 06:36:52
Yes, part of the reason was the way coinbase rolled it out (and allowed the coinbase staff to make a fortune with their inside info, too).
Once people realized that they had been scammed by coinbase, AND that BCH was an inferior crypto as well, they started dumping it.  Its never recovered, and most who are knowledgeable say it never will again.

Well, at least when users log onto coinbase, they will see things like [THIS](
so, imperfect as coinbase may be, at least they're honest.

oh wow, that makes sense.
Kinda explains why so many people on here get mad when someone posts a negative comment about bitcoin.
I mean, i always wondered why do some users (who are pro-bitcoin) rage out so hard when another user is critical of bitcoin?  But after reading your comment, it now makes sense. (side note: i have noticed that the people who rage out against others tend to be the people who are pro-bitcoin.  The people that are bearish on bitcoin, are actually critical of bitcoin itself, but they are the ones who are polite to the fellow users of this bitcoin subreddit).
Personally, i don't know that much about bitcoin, although i did buy some just in case (it lost most of its value, but i knew that was possible from day one).  Anyway, I would never be mad at someone else for liking bitcoin, or not liking bitcoin (i figure everyone is entitled to their own opinions).
I guess I will just wait and see what happens with bitcoin's price , and in the meantime, I will be nice to everyone on here, whether or not they like bitcoin or not.

well, i have failed at everything i have done, for the last decade at least.
about three years ago, i was barely getting by (making about $9K a year) with dreams of working in the entertainment business. It (clearly) was not happening for me in that business, so I gave up any hopes of finding my dream job.  So, after giving up what i wanted to really do because i wasn't making money at it, at all, I decided to do something totally different.  I spent a year taking classes, training, and getting licensed to sell real estate.  I thought this would be a good choice.  2 years ago i started work at a real estate brokerage, and over the last 2 years I have earned about $12.5K a year (and I work full time).  Others who joined the company at the same time are making between $120-150K/per year. So, here i am, 53 years old, making less money than some kid at Mcdonalds, and no idea what to do next?  Do I keep trying at real estate, even though its been two solid years of financial failure?  Or do I figure out something totally new?  Like I said, i am 53, and I just wasted the last 3 years.  I only mention these things (not because i expect an answer, but because that's what I'm thinking about these days, what to do?).  I am willing to try something new, but since everything i try I fail at, its hardly like i feel excited to try something new.  I don't even know what i want to do?  My life has been at least 10 years of solidly failing at everything I try (and my love life? LOL I am actually fit and attractive, but how many women do you know that want to date a 53 year old guy who rents a room, and makes $12.5K a year?).  I am just tired of years and years and years of failing with not even the most basic level of success at anything.
I rolled the dice on bitcoin, although you're right, i know its not a big deal, its just that fact that its just one more failure in my life thats nothing but an endless stream of failures.
Anyway, sorry to ramble (I think i really wrote this more for myself to clear my head, and get these ideas out there for me to see) and thanks for your kind words!
@_date: 2019-01-15 02:18:01

I actually think of myself as a loser, because thats factually correct.    I worked like hell at a new career for the last two years (I became a real estate agent), the first year i made about 20K, this year i did even worse, and made about $9k (yes, for the entire year).  Other agents who joined the same company at the same time are making $120-150K this year.  So, by all measures,  i have totally failed at that job (I am now going to have to try something new, or do what I do in a totally different way - whatever the case, i worked HARD and yet still failed).  Additionally, I have failed at romance.  I am actually fit and relatively attractive, but do you think that in Los Angeles California there are ANY decent women that want to go out with a 53 year old guy who makes $9K a year?  So, i am a failure at love and dating.  I'd love to have a family and kids, but see previous example, you need a good woman first.  So, I now have no decent job, no idea what i want to do (something truly terrible like being a 53 year old uber driver seems like the only option), no idea where i even want to live (being a grown man who lives as a roommate in someone else how isn't exact a self-esteem builder, either), and feel like a loser because everything is doing poorly in my life.  I once had dreams of working in film and TV as a writer or performer (but i have long since given up on that failed dream, too) These days my biggest dream is just to say fuck trying and just go live in a van (so yeah, my dreams are not even good).  And hey, you think i want to re-invent myself all over again? I did that (most recently) three years ago when i started real estate training, one year of training, then two years of financial failure working as a real estate agent.   So... sorry to rant (I guess i'm just mostly writing this for myself) but in a purely empirical sense, i am a loser.  thats just the facts.  To think otherwise would be to be in denial.  I don't even have any terrible vices like drinking or drugs to blame my lack of success on, and I definitely don't see a path to becoming a winner (or happy) from where i am now.  Nonetheless i am trying to figure out how to be happy, or a non-loser.   I'll just have to see what happens in the future.

first bought in about 7k
then some along the way, on the way up.
then i bought a bunch more when it was around 18k (cause i believed all those in december 2017 who said it was going to 40K and above)
obviously, i was an idiot.
I lost about 75% of the money that i put into it.
Everyone is now saying ti will be about 10 years before I ever break even, if I ever do.
Oh well... I gave it a shot, and i lost (but it was my choice)
I'll just HODL, why not, at this point.
Anyway, thats my story, your mileage may vary.
@_date: 2019-01-29 00:19:56
yes, good advice
i probably "should" sell (based on your wise guidelines) but i'm too afraid of feeling even worse if it goes way up again.
so, i just think of the money i have in bitcoin as already gone, and then i just leave it and HODL (and hope one day it might go up again)
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:46:29
isn't that double what coinbase charges?
and i am sure there are low fees besides coinbase.
I am no expert, but 4% seems rather expensive, especially when there are other, much cheaper options out there to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-25 23:46:29
yes, i am an idiot, and i seem to fail at most things I do in life.
so obvious, falling for FOMO, and betting on bitcoin when i did was a classic move that I wold do.
basically, if you want to be successful financially, but also in life in general, here's a tip...
just watch what i do, and then do the opposite.
but yes, u/gretteaj is correct, i was an idiot who fell for FOMO and who stupidly thought it "would be different this time" for me, with bitcoin.

Now leave that btc where it is, and don't touch if for a few years, forget about it.
but while you wait, just work all you can to get out of debt and save some money.  Even if you have to work 80 hours a week at McDonalds or driving uber, whatever you do, just live as cheap as you can, and work, work, work.
Thats just my 2 cents, but if you do that, and just hold and forget about your btc, then you might be in good shape in a couple of years.
wishing you the best!
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:16:06
yes i did
i remember in Fall/Winter of 2017 people on here said bitcoin would keep going up, so i bought it 
(being careful to follow the rules of only investing what i could afford to lose)
I didn't know better, so i thought people on here would be correct.
I wound up losing 80% of the value of what i bought in 2017
So, i am going to keep on holding, but i have since learned a lesson, don't believe what i hear on here.
I mean, i might ask a question or two, just to get input from others, but i know that i am too stupid to know what bitcoin will do, so i just hold on to what i have, and hope for the best.
I tend to fail at most things i try, so i'll just wait and see, and hope that me buying bitcoin is the exception? (although, who knows?)
I'm just gonna leave it and hope in a few years it goes up
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:55:05

As such, I won't buy any more bitcoin, but i hope other people do, that way, the little i have will go up in value.  I'd love to convince EVERYONE to buy more, and as such, I see your point (and i will only say positive things about bitcoin, publicly) Wise advice, thank you!

Oh, i did.  i transferred money from bank account into coinbase, and then bought crypto with that.  It was a while back, but i think it charged me 1% (if i remember correctly)  Some people say its free now.  Whatever the case, its still a better price than spending 8-10% of your money on ATM fees.

good points
i am working on that now, i thought working in real estate would be a good career, that i'd also enjoy.
i spent a year training and getting my license, and then i got a job at a real estate brokerage.  I've been there just over two year, and have made about $25k total (or about an average of $12.5K per year).  So, i am living like a pauper and making less money than some kid who works at McDonalds, so this career choice has been a failure, and a total waste of 3 years.  
Onward and upward, time to figure out what else i can do?  I just don't want to waste another 2 or 3 years of my life, and i am tired of working extremely hard, and yet living in extreme poverty.

lol, thats a fallacy that many people fall into.
that makes about as much sense as saying that a guy who buys a house for a million dollars cash, and then a week later it burns down, and all thats left is a piece of land worth $100K
if you say, well, he hasn't lost anything until he sells it, you'd be wrong.
He lost 900K in value.  Its just that it was in a non-liquid asset like real estate.  but that 900K in value is gone no matter how you look at it.

my personal rule is that any investment that loses 80% of its value is an investment I don't buy again.
i mean, i know losing it was a risk, and i knowingly gambled, and only invested what i could afford to lose
but now that i lost 80%, i am out.  I will watch the market, to see what i have does, whether it goes up or down, but other than that, i'm out, i lost too much already, i can't afford to lose any more!

oh cool, thanks for the info.  Its good to know where it will be, and when

first of all, no need to downvote me just because you disagree with an opinion I politely stated on here (that's just being nasty)  Try being nice (for example, even though you did that, i did NOT downvote you.)
As for your comment about cash... yes, I understand, but i can easily put cash into my bank account, and then just transfer that into my coinbase account.
Once its in my coinbase account, I can buy all the bitcoin i want, and i can buy 8-10% more bitcoin, with the same amount of money, because i won't have to pay 8-10% in ATM fees.
Maybe its just me (as i am VERY thrifty and don't like to waste any of my money) but I know I would never pay high fees, when I had other options that had no (or low) fees.

Warren knows stocks, but when it comes to technology, its hardly a shocker that an 88 year old guy is underinformed on brand new new developments in technology and crypto assets.
Still, he's a smart guy, so he might come around yet, and admit his errors (although, at this point in his life, I think he just wants to hold on to what he has already, as he's more interested in keeping his current wealth than he is in accumulating more).

good plan, if we just do the opposite of each other, one of us has to win.
after all, a plan put together by two losers could never fail, could it?
@_date: 2019-01-26 01:06:37
no, i never said that
i am not blaming anyone but myself.  i know that what happens to me is, in large part, a direct result of my own actions (and no one else's)
i somehow walk around life with the mindset of a loser, and thats what comes back at me.  I have tried to change it, and have never succeeded in doing so.
i know its my own fault, my own mindset, and its me (and only me) that can change it.
I spend an insane amount of time thinking and writing about it (and taking actions that i hope will work) but thus far, i haven't figured out the working formula for success or happiness.   i just cant seem to figure out, or do anything to change the fact that i see myself as a loser, and as a result "Losing" is what happens to me.
Hey, i do hope it changes, i kinda doubt it will (but i still have a tiny bit of hope - which is why i keep trying new things, hoping one day one of them will work)
Anyway, my problem, not yours... but i did want to set the record straight that i count blame "the universe" or anything or anyone else for my life and the lack of success in it.
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:17:01
cool, what about bitcoin, will it improve? what do you think? (i only ask because i like the way you think, you seem to be a bit more skeptical and realistic that a lot of people on here, who just act like it can ONLY go up)
@_date: 2019-01-17 06:27:35
you mean like a popular doctor?
oh wait, that's patients, not patience 
@_date: 2019-01-23 01:18:13


yes, very true, you are correct, and...that applies to most stocks, and to real estate, too.
but if an item crashes in price for any number of reasons (market crash, house burns down, whatever) then an asset loses value.  Whether you sell it then, or not, that doesnt mean you haven't suffered a loss.
Same with when a stock doubles in value, you have had a gain (whether you sell it or not).
but yes, its strange, and its hard for some new to investing and assets to comprehend.  To make it simple for newbies to understand, yes, some say "you haven't lost until you sell" as a way to more simply explain that you will gain and lose value through the length of time you hold any asset, and until you convert it back to fiat it doesnt really matter ...but that's not only flawed in valuing the asset, its incorrect because the measure (fiat currency) is an ever-changing in its value as well.
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:38:31
makes sense
i probably should sell, but i already lost so much, it would break my heart even more if it spiked AFTER i sold (so I'll hold)
on the other hand, i have already lost so much (i'm down 80%) so its not like i want to buy any more, so i am not planning on buying.
so yeah... i see your point with millions of others in the same boat, no wonder things are not moving up OR down (although, before very recently, things were moving down a lot, i hope that the downward moving stops)
@_date: 2019-09-03 04:11:10
i did spread it out, then it went down negative 70%
and i had no more money i could afford to lose
gee wizz!  i guess some rich out of touch elite like you has no idea what its like to be poor
so you just tell us to invest more, all as you're oblivious to someone like me being out of money 
ok, daddy warlocks, whatever
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:03:08
like everyone has extra money all the time
and yes, going back in time, there was a huge bump
but for anyone who bought from late 2017 onward, its as likely a boom as a bust
basically a gamble
and it might go even lower again
3k is as likely as 20k
be careful
if you want safer investment, buy Vanguard or similar funds
The past was a great time to buy bitcoin (especially pre 2017)
but to buy now?  yikes!
VERY risky business.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:52:52


You tried to set me up, you saw someone who was unhappy with bitcoin,
YOU MADE THE FIRST OFFER, OFFERING TO BUY.. i said a joke in reply, but then you came back with a serious offer of $3k
$3 for an asset worth 10k?  Get out of here you scammer, trying to trey on those who dont know about the market
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:59:07
I have, and I did stop
My original  post was written super calmly and logically
thes unsolicited some guy wrote to me, first, with offers to buy (i mean, this is not really the place to be trying to buy from someone, but hut hey, i wrote him back) 
i even replied in a friendly joke when i saw what he was up to (trying to get someone unhappy with bitcoin to sell to him in frustration, so he could take advantage of me)
But he persisted, writing back with a specific price of $3k (WTF!?) Hes trying to start bidding, all with the goal of ripping me off.  no thanks.  So, if it could happen to me, it could happen to others, so i reported him (and i was not sneaky about it, i let him know)
r/bitcoin is not  place where a bunch of sharks can go to try to seek out anyone unhappy with price, and then try to pounce on them, and buy cheaply.
This is not a place where someone shares something and then a bunch of outside buyers just start trying to get them to sell, at WAY UNDER market prices.
We should be free to just share our concerns without  a bunch of people trying to buy from us, and urging us to sell to them.
This is not how it works here, we should just be free to share whatever is bethinking up, or whatever we like, with out dudes being like "oh you are unhappy about bitcoin, i'll buy them from you, at 25% of their current market value"
no no no thats not what this awesome subregit is about.
we are not a bunch f greedy sharks trying to take advance of each other at our low points.
we are here to build up, educate and support one another, we are not here to try to rip fellow members off with extreme low ball offer to buy their bitcoin.
Anyway i did go one a bit, but i hope you can not see why i reported that guy, because what he was doing goes against everything we stand for here on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:11:25
ok, this is a personal insult
its against the TOS of this sub
it adds nothing to the conversation
I am not going to report you to the mods this time, but do it again, and i will
this is not a forum where we insult each other or call names, hurl insults.
please respect the rules of this subreddit
we are here to talk about bitcoin
got it?
@_date: 2019-09-02 08:29:41
No my stocks and investments will be fine
My bitcoin? I am not too sure
@_date: 2019-09-03 06:27:14
youre an obvious scammer
trying to trick people into seeing for way under actual value
I just reported you the mods for offering to buy, and for scammer
you SERIOUSLY violated the TOS of this subreddit
scammers like you need to go away!!!
SO sick of all the leaches out here, trying to rip people off.
You and your type are harming the community, take that  out of here, we dont want that here on this subreddit
Why are you trying to get people to sell to you for thousands under value?  You enjoy ripping people off?
YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTED!
@_date: 2019-09-02 08:28:14
Don’t you understand what buying only what you can afford to lose?
We all don’t have extra money every week.
Gee wiz! Talk about being out of touch with regular working man!
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:22:25
That looks like Satoshi Blackamoto
@_date: 2019-09-01 04:47:08


yes, if you buy at just right times, you can make money
there are other times it crashes down and is negative 70%
smart people know that you can't time the market, especially a market like bitcoin that is heavily manipulated by the pump and dump whales and disproportionate controlled by the silicon valley billionaires.  They run the show, not us little guys.
unless youre in those 2 groups (the pump n' dump whales or tech billionaires), its just a gamble.
At this point, it could easily go either way, no sure things, and a very risky proposition.
As such, i am not saying to others on here, dont buy bitcoin.
i am simply saying, if you do buy it, know what your getting into, know you could easily lose it all, and know its a totally risky purchase.
@_date: 2019-09-03 04:08:40
i already said i HODL
didnt you read?
but ok, i will sell you one bitcoin for $100k
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:07:44


nothing else?
nope, i started buying when btc was in the 7Ks, all the way up to 20K (the biggest boom)
then i was there for the biggest bust (20k to 3K)
now its just the big, long sideways, some ups, and lately... mostly downs.  all in all a depressing, slightly downward Bart lately.
Purely looking at the numbers (no emotions, just the pure math) its been the worst investment of my entire life.
I was burned, i will HODL but i won't buy and be burned again.
At this point, over the next few years, 3k is just as likely at 15K
Its a VERY risky situation, these next few years.  could cause many to lose much/most of what they have, if they buy now.
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:58:42


not me, i would never try to take advantage of someone and try to buy their bitcoin when they were feeling down, and try to buy at an extremely low price from them.
Just like my original post, i tried to warm others to be careful.  I am not saying i am a saint, but my instinct is to try to protect my fellow bitcoiners, not scam them, or profit off them but ripping them off.
if i did buy bitcoin from an individual I would offer them a fair price (a price that was fair to us both)
In any event, thanks for the kind words and a I wish the best to you as well
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:13:00


yes, investments that lose 35% of the money that i put into them tend to make me feel *cloudy*
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:04:19
its so obvious.
i mean, i bought in 2017 and 2018, and i'm way down
so seriously, you need to learn the maths, son!
