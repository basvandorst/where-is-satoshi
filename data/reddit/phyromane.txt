Went with Johntheripper. Fed it with a rather huge (75GB!) generated dictionary and set it on the wallet hashes.

Worked with the JohnTheRipper Jumbo Suite (found on github) to extract the hash from the wallet.dat and start testing for the passwords.
Generated a custom password dictionary using some python scripts I found online.
I am no expert by any means. It was A LOT of try and error and countless hours of googling. 
Before I started I didn´t even know how to start a python script.
The answers are out there, just spent some serious amount of time on google.

That was the testing of the dictionary.
The generation of the dictionary took a long weekend on a rather powerful machine.
I knew the majority of the password-components, just not the order, minor or capital, correct order of the numbers and so on.
For somebody who hasn´t access to these components it´ll be rather impossible to crack by brute force.

This gave me a good laugh!

Relief nails it. I´ve been watching the rally, 5k, 6k, 10k.... And I cannot access it! The fear of never retrieving the password...
You know, I´m an engineer. I imagined a safe in which i put some money, and the money started doubling, multiplying... great, except that i can´t pull out the torch and pry bar to pull it open. It´s fucking crypto, like an imprenetable safe on my desktop.
What a feeling when the found password was accepted!

That looks very promising! Thank you!

Not really. I´ve always thougt I knew the password, and let it sitting in there and was happy about the growth.
3 Months ago, I wanted to transfer to another wallet and was just dumbfolded when I couldn´t remember the correct one. 
Cashing out was only really an option in desperate times.

Well, I do mind. Enough to make my day &amp; christmas ;)
