high fee does hurt the user experience, especially for those noobs. Imagine buying $100 bitcoin and end up getting less than $80 worth or getting stuck in the mempool limbo for 2 weeks.

only the first confirmation is at risk of how much fee you pay.
Once its in the block (1st confirmation), the subsequent blocks will  automatically confirms the transactions in its previous blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:11:14
fee is based on the amount of bytes in your transaction, but not the amount of btc you send.
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:03:53
Back then, 70% trading volume is in one exchange: Mt.Gox.
Centralization created these problems.
Today we have many many exchanges all over the world. So something like this is much harder to happen nowadays.

stupid fud.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:16:43
Yeah, Let's make the block size 100kb then.
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:22:42
I have a question for the small blockers. 
At what block size, an below average $300 PC can't handle a full node?  Current blockchain size is 127GB. You can get a 2TB HD for $50 now days. $100 gets you a quad core processor
Why not do scaling on both on-chain and side-chain? What is your hidden agenda?
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:14:24
You over simplified the issue.
Not each one of the core devs has equal influence in the community.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:58:39
This is what you guys been asking for. 1mb FTW. suck it up.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:33:38
Stupid as fxxk.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:41:24
Bitcoin is for storage of value like gold. For day to day small transaction, go use shit coins. Decentralization requires small blocks, don't you get it?!
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:05:32
1mb cult went full retarded.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:34:02
The ppl who is pumping bch have huge amount of btc to dump. They might want to keep the momentum going for longer.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:59:16
1mb cult FTW!
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:44:53
without replay protection is great. Because this will only be a temporary hard fork. The weak chain is not expected to survive, that is the whole point of no replay protection.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:21:52
if you own bitcoin before Aug 1st, you should have same amount of bch. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:30:01

Strangle Bitcoin base block to 1mb, to me, is an attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:12:35
Anything over 1mb is not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:30:25
I don't see increase of block size is necessary whenever fee is below $1,000 dollars. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:19:18
bitso who?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:55:34
let's have a 1kb block size Bitcoin fork and call it Bitcoin Mini. This should be the best decentralized bitcoin ever.

I carefully checked Chinese medias. It seems that his speech was in 2013 when he was the head of State Administration of Foreign Exchange . He said citizens have the freedom to participate in trading Bitcoins. I think it was mistakenly translated into "bitcoin provides freedom to anyone that uses it".

I'm 100% positive.

to match the particles of the universe. Bitcoin address needs to be 266 bit long. Currently 160 bit long. so it's doable.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:21:45
Yeah, I think we should worship them. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:22:01
1mb FTW. Only maintaining at 1mb, can we keep the blockchain decentralized.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:44:07
Who is this monkey?
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:42:06
Miners' best interest is to see Bitcoin price to grow. The best way for bitcoin price to grow, is to have more people using it. Both on-chain and off-chain scaling are good for Bitcoin's adoption. With on-chain scaling could have much quicker solution to current high TX fee disaster. I see no reason that Miners want to block off-chain scaling. They are only not happy about off-chain ONLY scaling. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:34:06
1. It will take long time if never for Bitcoin to achieve Visa transaction numbers. Bandwidth and computer hardware cost will only get cheaper over time.
2. On-chain Scale with non-contentious hard fork is the lease risky and technological simplest way to scale Bitcoin. i.e. much less source code modifications.
3. Bitcoin should take advantage of faster and cheaper  bandwidth and hardware. Increase block size conservatively based on the actual tech advancement. while relatively maintaining the cost of running a full node.
It is unbelievable that a such low hanging fruit (on-chain scaling) is abandoned. Rather, a more riskier, not proven path was chosen by the most talented human-beings on earth.

could you provide statistic history of equivalent two addresses output transactions? I'm wondering if the actual transaction numbers (not obscured by batching) are increasing or decreasing? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:38:07
because 2mb will fundamentally totally disastrously centralized the blockchain. And that is very evil.
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:18:48
Who cares what this guy said, only Core and r/bitcoin define what bitcoin is.

What best LTC can hope for is BTC gives up micro-payment transactions, and leave that to LTC. 
1mb block FTW.
That make sense.

Locking bitcoin at 1mb is the small minded thinking.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:30:36
The reason that Charlie supports Core Devs is that '1mb' Bitcoin is unusable for small on-chain transactions. That creates a big opportunity for Litecoin.

The biggest centralization problem in the Bitcoin world is development centralization. For many ppl, Core is Jesus, LOCKstream is the God. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:28:17
Ultimately, miners enforce the rules they like. Miners can actually set rules. So many ppl here like you don't even read the Bitcoin whitepaper and just blindly worship Core.
