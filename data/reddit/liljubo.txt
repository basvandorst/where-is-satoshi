Why do you need Wordpress for a blog? Just code it yourself from zero.
And why use a blockchain or have your customers store colored coins in Electrum when MongoDB is web scale?!

post-Snowden: "but who didn't see *that* coming?"
before Snowden: Conspiracy theorist! Don't you know the NSA can't monitor the *global* internet because patriotism?
But no, let's not speak about massive injustices as they are happening, since they are after all "inevitable". Fuck you.

If that many companies are adopting cryptocurrency I'm quite sure Bitcoin will do just fine then, andthank you for your work in Monero.
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:36:36
Except monitoring monetary transactions is the **most** tyrannical form of communications spying, PERIOD. It's worse than monitoring phone calls, by a huge margin! The only difference is less people use Bitcoin today than use cell phones. As that changes, companies like this one are going to be the NSA's favorite puppets. Or maybe Facebook will buy them, because them learning all of your spending habits would go hand in hand with their turning on your iPhone's microphone to listen in on ambient noise.
No information is more telling about you than how you spend your money.

If gold was "abandoned", why do governments still keep gold reserves?
Paul Krugman and other economists are pseudo scientist crackpots that are only "right" until they aren't. Miraculously, the corporate media gives these crackpots airtime thanks to their fancy sounding degrees and smug sophistry.
The debt fueled investment-driven economy like we have today, where we all have to place our collective trust into enormous, corruptible centralized institions like the Federal Reserve is unsustainable. Investment is good, but the mindless consumerism is destroying our planet, and governments around the world have absolutely severed the social contract. One spark and the system as we know it is **POOF** gone, over and done. It benefits the wealthy elite disproportionately and it is creating inescapable plutocracy the fabrics of society have to be held up by a ruthless police state and spy cartel to keep the masses at bay.
Thankfully, due to human greed and self interest, a deflationary distributed currency always will be more attractive to investors and consumers than a centralized inflationary currency controlled by a secretive cabal of ultra wealthy international bankers.
Collectivist arguments are futile. Self interest wins out, and that is why Bitcoin adoption is inevitable. If you were tech savvy Venezuelan or Argentine, this outcome would be more obvious to you.

I quoted the article.
“Adidas can say: these are proprietary shoes that only Bitcoin users, or only FitCoin users, or only AdidasCoin users can get based on this currency.”
For now it seems like marketing event only for SXSW. Their eventual plan is you would only get rewarded in a colored coin or altcoin. Otherwise they'd just be lighting money on fire. It's never going to work.
What ROI are you talking about? You didn't say anything about how they can make up for pissing away $200,000 an hour. It isn't going to happen from wristband sales is it?
@_date: 2015-03-14 20:31:37
But of course! Justifying tyranny is doable if we can just *predict* it. Who didn't see *that* coming!
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:03:04
It costs them $200,000 an hour if they have a million people in the promotion before they move to a colored coin. As confident as I am in wristband sales, yea I don't think that's going to do anything but piss away money if it's a giveaway of cash.
Their plan is “Adidas can say: these are proprietary shoes that only Bitcoin users, or only FitCoin users, or only AdidasCoin users can get based on this currency.” you only get rewarded if you use or promote use of their platform. And if they did it with colored coins the cost would be zero. You're telling me that's proof colored coin promos are snake oil?
If it is just a giant cash giveaway, I mean more power to them but that is a great way to piss away money.

They're trying to tie all your Bitcoin activity to your IP, **and then working with Coinbase to establish risk levels based on this information**. Just because you can do that doesn't mean Bitcoin is better if we all have to be transparent about where our money is at all times, where it goes and when. If it's unavoidable with Bitcoin, Bitcoin is going to be replaced by something better where this doesn't happen. I'm not even going to comment on fungibility, it's just a lame anti-feature that benefits no one.
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:38:13
yea I don't see any difference between a for-profit company sybil attacking bitcoin as their sole profit model and an independent security researcher. No difference whatsoever!
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:21:30
According to the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, marketing firms are supposed to procure thousands of BTC to pay consumers as part of a promotion? Are they stupid? Go ahead, show me the math. Show the boardroom how the ROI of procuring BTC and giving it away for free compares to the ROI of inventing a colored coin and giving it away for free. Hmmm ... gee I wonder which would achieve the same result for less cost.
I mean for crying out loud, why does every use of cryptocurrency *need* to pump your personal investment portfolio? Why can't you just be happy that more people are using cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2015-02-24 05:01:30
Not if you bought your coins for cheap.
Without a 1031 it's like you sold them for dollars when you convert rom BTC to sidecoin. And if BTC appreciates in USD price while you're on a sidecoin, and you don't do a 1031 on the way out, you owe capital gains again.
@_date: 2015-03-14 20:28:13
Yea, but so is everything else to some degree. Volatility risk exists with commodities and risk of Goxxing exists with fiat and commodities both. Fiat currencies are stable, but limited by AML and KYC laws. The only *legal* trustless option would be a decentralized futures and options market where large Bitcoin accepting merchants could hedge risk without touching fiat.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:22:39
It's a media stunt. But loyalty points have more utility the more you can do with them. A big part of that would include freely trading them for other cryptocurrencies and piggybacking on top of existing bitcoin payment processors and wallets. Bitcoin payment rails are almost always going to much better than what the average marketing firm can come up with in house.

Most successful hacks are never discovered, and of the hacks that are discovered, few are ever disclosed.
This is a bemusing if counterproductive comparison metric. Firstly, it's "amount lost of reserves or customer funds" that matters, and it's very possible for exchanges to lose customer funds without ever being hacked. They could lose funds due to their own incompetence. This is the important metric: number of coins lost.
However, I'm ambivalent on the number of coins lost metric, because if it becomes a popular method of comparing exchanges, then exchanges that lose coins will will move to cover up all incidents. Popularizing this metric will incentivize ponzis and fractional reserve schemes.
I'm not sure what the best strategy is for informing consumers. No software, website or service is above being hacked. None are impervious. It's a matter of when, not if. Think of a stalker, he watches everything you do. Social engineers your peer group, finds about how you tick. There are professional hackers doing this to target all Bitcoin exchanges with decent traction and high reserves. In short, it would be stupid if we have noobies running to exchanges that have lost zero coins. To a professional hacker we are all just lemmings.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:58:27
Caramba! This is spot the fuck on. Security is scary with bitcoin because it's like walking around with cash on your person, except it's additionally stealable by hackers.
It's not just street criminals and hackers you worry about either. How about the REAL criminals - IRS son. You can literally LOSE money just by spending your Bitcoin on shit if you don't keep your books straight. **My life is a living hell right now with tax season**. Who are you people who figured out how to use bitcoin anonymously and perfectly?  Seriously the only people who have benefited from Bitcoin in the past years bought it for cheap and didn't spend it or move it. They just did nothing and sat on their wealth so they have no taxes or privacy shit to worry about. But if you use Bitcoin in the real world, for real life, shit flies off the handle if you aren't careful. No way in HELL is this system ready for mainstream adoption. Actually it might be ready for mainstream adoption if the IRS and government didn't exist.

Meh, foreign bank accounts are a huge hassle with PITA reporting requirements. It's already a huge sacrifice to go with a domestic Bitcoin banking service. Cold storage is the best foreign bank account there is. I just don't know what to do about advanced persistent threats, extortion, and dying. It really seems like there's no way to avoid installing a keylogger from an APT no matter who you are.

If you swapped BTC today for BTC of another person, not even talking about sidechains, this is taxable unless you do a 1031.
Again, if it is *third party involvement* that triggers the taxable event, then you could presumably work around that by burning your BTC for a sidecoin.
However, I've read from the founders of Blockstream that the conversion between BTC and sidecoins through SPV burns would have to be delayed by several days for security's sake. Trustless atomic swaps could get around that, but now you've involved a third party and when you involve the third party you involve the IRS.
Hey, if it makes you feel better, you could always not report your taxable activities. Welcome to the hell that is Bitcoin accounting. I'm doing my taxes scared out of my mind because it's only a matter of time before they start targeting bitcoiners unless the phenomenon dies down.
The point of the 1031 is to tell the IRS, hey, I exchanged like-property for like-property, but I get to keep my *original basis* in the original property. It's like the exchange didn't happen, but you can only make the exchange un-happen by filing a 1031.
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:01:18
That's not why I said what I said. I enjoy holding BTC in cold storage because my cold storage is untouchable by legal systems, which are fraught with jealous spouses, aggressive lawyers, cops doing civil asset forfeiture, and plainly corrupt tax collectors.

Sidechains aren't a complete solution. For example, if a sidechain fork of Bitcoin Core proves anonymous ring signatures like Monero can work in Bitcoin Core without bugs, we would definitely want to integrate that back into the main chain's Bitcoin Core. This is because money on sidechains will never be as safe or as liquid and useful as BTC on the main chain. I don't feel comfortable with the idea of storing a chunk of my wealth in a sidechain over the long term, because there's too much of a human touch involved in the security. There's already a high enough risk of 51% attacks on the main chain, plus I wouldn't want to be in a situation where the price of Bitcoin is crashing and oops looks like Bitstamp doesn't accept deposits in XYZBBQ sidecoin, so now I have to trade out of the sidecoin back into Bitcoin, and oh crap is that taxable? And how long does that take to do the conversion. See what I mean you would rather have the biggest chunk of your wealth on the main chain even if sidechains work perfectly. The real BTC is always going to be the most useful and liquid instrument, sidechains mainly are good as a testing ground.
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:46:27


If you didn't do that, you would recognize your gains right then and there at the time you swapped BTC for sidecoin with another person. Whether you do the swap on a centralized exchange or decentralized exchange wouldn't matter. I don't know if the SPV burn method where there is no third party involved in the exchange would be under these regulations. [Let's hope it doesn't](

Edit: should've read further down, he bought most of his coins prior to the 2011 $32 bubble. Basically I cannot imagine myself believing it was safer to keep my money in BTC since late 2013 and at any time in 2014. My average price point is $500, and I consider myself lucky. I have invested around $100000, and I take great pains to keep my bitcoins safe in cold storage. It isn only the volatility that makes bitcoin unsafe, although that's a big reason. I would honestly prefer to keep bitcoins in a bank, if that didn't entirely defeat the purpose of bitcoin itself for me. I feel like you have to be in control of your bitcoins, cold storage 100%, to get the full benefits. My worst fear is being extorted or hacked by an advanced persistent threat, and also I don't like the idea of dying with my coins but I don't know how to solve this. I feel like Coinbase is the obvious solution to personal hackers, violent stalkers as well as dying with your coins, but that completely defeats the purpose of Bitcoin for me.
It's just that I read "feel safer with my money in it", and couldn't disagree more. This is one of Bitcoin's more profound shortcomings, because if you take it to its logical conclusion, then we either still need centralized entities to protect us - Coinbase - or we get rid of centralized entities completely because leaking your net worth to anyone with the risks of extortion and APT hackings, becomes scary. Thus the throwaway, btw. I still believe BTC is headed to the moon and I'm just airing this because it scares the shit out of me. I'm like, "what if I already have a keylogger?"
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:44:09
Now this I support. Never sell. Especially for Americans thinking about using offshore exchanges, jesus christ no. Reporting requirements are insane, and you will loathe paying capital gains taxes.

The IRS aint your friend bro. I really feel like talking about this right now because nobody ever told me these things when I got into bitcoin and it's making my life a living hell right now.
Just look at this: **1031 Exchange Rules**
[IRS: Like-Kind Exchanges Under IRC Code Section 1031](


If you want an exchange of BTC to sidecoins to not be taxable, even if you can PROVE to the IRS beyond a shadow of a doubt that the two assets being exchanged qualify for 1031 treatment, you need to get an intermediary to sign off on the transaction otherwise it's taxable as if you exchanged BTC for something else which makes you liable for capital gains.


Sound good to you?


It isn't that simple, because there can lots of sidechains and maybe Bitstamp doesn't want to set their systems up to accept deposits in all sidechains because that requires time and money to lay out. If you have money in an unsupported chain then it makes it harder to hedge your risk and maybe harder to pay for goods because it'd be on individuals or BitPay and Coinbase to add all the sidechains which is time and money for them too, and they aren't going to add them all. Maybe they can't add Monero sidechain because Ben Lawsky says no? It could go wrong in all kinds of ways. You want that shit in BTC proper so it works with no issues.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:29:34


Have to agree with this, to an extent. I'm far from the best prepared taxpayer, but it's great that you have the chance to revisit records from years ago just by opening your wallet. It rarely worked that easy for me in practice, since I stupidly sent my BTC through some exchanges and several different types of wallets, so most of the time I'm blind to what BTC came from where and for what reason. It's impossible to know which BTCs came from MtGox or from wallets I no longer have, and how can I prove it if I no longer control the wallet or MtGox is down? It makes me wonder why we can't store labels on the blockchain in OP_RETURN, because in practice I'm completely oblivious as to what a given BTC address means in my exports, and when my accountant saw the exported records from the various bitcoin exchanges, he told me he couldn't do anything with it. I would be gushing over how perfect it is if every transaction to and from my wallets were labeled and that history got pulled down from the blockchain, but to be perfectly honest, doing my taxes has never been so hard, since I spent and traded my bitcoins during the year.
