I would trust PayPal more than the existing online bitcoin wallet providers. It may change in the future but it often takes many years to build up a mainstream reputation as a reliable provider.

Let's say that the Chinese government starts to take bitcoin as a potential threat to their own currency the yuan. How difficult would it be for them to do a 51% attack? Heck, they probably even have their own ASIC factories. Why would they do that? To destroy bitcoin! Like digital warfare almost, except such attack would be legal as far as I know.

Yes, ok, and the attack would probably only be temporary, because the Bitcoin software would fairly quickly be updated to handle more transactions per second. Yet still, it could be worthwhile to do a thorough DoT threat analysis. Just in case. Maybe some attacker, like a big government, really could spend billions of dollars on a DoT attack, and then it could go on for quite some time, even after a modification of the Bitcoin software.

Cost isn't always an issue. As I wrote in another comment: An attacker like the Chinese government (or even the U.S. government) can easily spend billions of dollars to attack bitcoin if their own currencies are deemed to be at risk of being threatened. Making the Bitcoin network nonoperational removes the threat of bitcoin becoming too dominating for defenders of fiat currencies.

I think the bitcoin supply can be called a controlled inflation over a period of time.

A trust system would be shaky. Several miners could have built up trust just to act as an army of Trojan horses later. Or a big player can buy a trusted mining operation and then use it for attacks on bitcoin.

Maybe a single successful double spend would do enough psychological damage to destroy bitcoin as a functional currency.

Would the cost really be that high? Say 10 cents per transaction and 7 transactions per second. That's only $2,520 per hour.

Yes, it's a joke about how bitcoin mining is becoming more and more extreme. To a point where in the future racks filled with ASICs will have to be submerged in mineral oil for enough cooling.

Oh, I discovered articles about that now. Interesting. Yeah, that could very well be the reason for the bitcoin price increase.

Ha, they missed DoT attacks in the report. The closest they have is: "DN3 Transaction volume becomes so high that only backbone-datacenter nodes can handle it" and "DN4 DDoS attacks", neither of which is the same as a DoT attack.
What I call a Denial of Transactions (DoT) attack can be done without it being a DDoS attack. The Bitcoin network can still be fully responsive only that it can no longer keep up with the number of transaction requests. And not even backbone-datacenter nodes will be able to handle the amount of requests since the limit of 7 transactions per second is limited by the Bitcoin specification.

It depends on the definition of deflation I guess. I was thinking of deflation as a shrinkage of the money supply. The amount of bitcoins will only go down if bitcoins are burned or lost etc.

I came to think of the same thing. PayPal may have extra fees on bitcoin. Not good. Or, they may offer bitcoin wallets with 0% extra fees to get new users and as an extra value to existing users. And they could offer a direct exchange between fiat currencies and bitcoin. That would be pretty convenient and PayPal could have a fee only for the exchange service, while keeping 0% extra fees on bitcoin transactions to remain competitive.

I meant that the attacker would produce blocks that looked normal but were messed up with fake transactions. Just to cause havoc. But may not much damage can be done that way. I don't know.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:45:03
My idea is that many people would trust (right or wrong) a PayPal wallet more than the other online bitcoin wallets out there. And if PayPal would include a convenient way to directly exchange bitcoins for fiat currencies and vice versa then that would be valuable for their users and boost a mainstream adoption of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:40:12
Couldn't the attacker produce what looks like valid blocks but with totally messed up transactions, just as an attempt to wreak havoc in the Bitcoin network? Then the longer fraud chains would be difficult to detect.

Imagine some banksters having a plan for launching their own cryptocurrency. People who trade with trillions of dollars on a daily basis. Then it would be very worthwhile for them to launch an attack to destroy bitcoin, or at least severely damage it. And they could have a secondary attack on Litecoin etc. And instead it being on a whim it would be a careful plan staged over several months.

I wonder how IBM is going to manage the open source project. Could be an interesting solution if they manage to really make it decentralized without they themselves being able to control the system. It's probably something similar to this: IBM &amp; Samsung live demo of ADEPT --
