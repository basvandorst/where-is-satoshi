Using federal power to play favorites with organizations that you share ideologies with as well as , auditing for political purposes, those annoy me.

Perfect analogy.

Thank you for your service to this thread. That needed to be said. I have a few friends who blame corporations, and stupid assed doctors and everyone else for their choices. This behavior is repugnant and generally associated with losers.

No it is not. She's a fake, a fraud, and a charlatan. Good day.

Do you guys hate the CRA as much as we hate the IRS? Is the cra an out of control agency up there like the IRS is here?

elizabeth warren is an incredible woman. I respect her strength and stoic stance for standing up to the prejudice she and her family had to endure as native Americans. We're really lucky to have such a pure woman.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:25:24
Understood. Thank you.

The decision to threaten OP by the bank has annihilated this financial institution's online presence. Absolutely destroyed it. Go check out their Facebook page and Google reviews.

Hand raised. Hodling though. 11,200 on Monday of this week.

Break that down for me. How is the tax cut bill going to cause the great depression 2?
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:17:49
Well, that's OK. I can guarantee that elizabeth warren would never... Ever... Ever make up a lie in order to profit. She is a true American native.
She is... Chief walking eagle.

You need to read up. Fraud is absolutely a criminal matter. You don't know what you are talking about.

Meditation. Download the "calm" app on Android and use it once a day.
I am a former USMC machine gunner, IT Manager, agnostic. If I can meditate, anyone can.
All depression comes from living in the past. All anxiety comes from living in the future. There is very little that comes from living in this moment.

Not too young here, but not too old. When you make a dollar, spend no less than 10¢ of it on a real deal retirement fund. Out of the same dollar, you should spend (on crypto) no more than you are absolutely willing to lose without notice.
Apply that formula to every dollar, and you can't go wrong and won't be another guy jumping out of the window when things go south.

11,2 - but also picked up a little at 16. Had a dream about them being worthless and having nothing last night. Then remembered that I spent disposable income on it, and am now enjoying my cofve.

Congratulations. I have a 7 year old son and remember well. 
1. Accept that your baby and wife need all of you all the time for the next year. 
2. Read to that little demon every single day and night until he's reading to himself.
3. Teach that little guy sign language to help communicate before he can talk to reduce crying. Just basic hand signs for eating, wet, etc. 
4. Take lots of pictures and videos for later.
5. Set him up a fund and pay that guy every pay period.
Good times, sorry for the unsolicited advice.

Here, have a rainbow colored windbreaker with the word VICTIM stamped across the back. Keep perpetuating the stereotypes.

Was kicking it around and everyone at work was like, you missed the bus. I kept saying that I missed several busses, but they keep coming. They laughed.
In 2 weeks, I am up. Settling in for the long run.

Threatening to close the account is a couple of bridges beyond monitoring in my humble opinion.

Are you in for more than you can afford to lose? I would look away for several months and come back. Occupy your mind elsewhere.

I didn't know that there were Danish billionaires. I thought the tax rate, combined with the age of the Universe made that a mathematical improbability.

You sure it isn't just privilege that got you where you are?  
Isn't it easier to just put on that rainbow colored windbreaker that says "Victim" across the back?

I bought at 11,200 last Monday. Sit tight, you'll be alright.

That is not what happened. It was a female agent who reached across the table and pulled it away from him while he was distracted by a fake argument.

I bought 1,000 worth at 11,200 and it's dropped dramatically during the day. I know that it will go back up, but still scared. This is my first time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:56:30
Thank you again. I appreciate that.

This is me too. I stopped drinking Starbucks when they started playing moral politics with their customers and have about a G saved. Was thinking of cutting the cord soon and may divert that money in there.

My friend, your guilt will be hard to sleep with if things go south. Please reconsider. Peace.

I purchased $1,000 yesterday. I have been watching from the sidelines since 2012 or so. This is a great post and I appreciate you swimming upstream to say it. I can lose 1k and not suffer. The nagging voice in my head has been silent for 24 hours now.
