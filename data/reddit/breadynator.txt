Tbf, I'd agree with you but just a week ago an old friend of mine came visiting us from Sweden and we somehow started talking about Bitcoin and crypto currency and he asked me "Bro, can you explain to me what the fuck a Blockchain is? I see that word all the time but I don't get it"
So yeah, for most people just knowing the currency is enough and they don't need to understand how it works. Just like nobody asks how PayPal or banks transfer money. However I think it's necessary for a widespread adoption to clear up any misconceptions and questions people have and they should at least know what a Blockchain is. Even if it's just a simplified explanation.

However that guy over there is just mad salty. Probably lost a lot of money because he listened to some YouTube crypto guru who put on a chart, drew some cirlces, said some buzzwords and said things like "invest in Genesis mining, it's defo not a Ponzi scheme"

Imagine I buy a painting for 5$ and suddenly it turns out the guy who made it is famous and what so not and the painting I bought costs 20 000 000$. Would that mean I owe 19 999 995$ in taxes? I don't think so. So why should Crypto be that way then?

Yeah, buy a stablecoin and then trade that for BTC. It's only about BTC. 
The lawmakers have NO IDEA how the world works. They live in their bubble theyself call "politics" and all they care about is theirs stupid politics. 
They've never heard about any other cryptocoin than BTC. They think that's all there is. All the laws they make only talk about BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:06:12
Tbh, if you want to pay with USD or EUR online, you'll have fees for the transaction processor most of the times (PayPal, Sofort, Skrill etc.) And if you compare that to the fees right now you're paying a lot less fees compared to classic pay services
@_date: 2019-11-20 14:03:01
But buying too much would mean there would be a lot less Bitcoin circulating, thus making it less valuable. Or am I wrong?

(There were things like "your 250k Bitcoin is nothing against my 5$ wrench" etc)
Well, the guy who made the post apparently deleted his account. I hope he's alright, because now the internet knows who he is, how much money he has and how much crypto he owns. It's kinda ridiculous to see at which point we're all acting like primitive primates who'll kill another primate just because he has a shiny rock.

As an average person who thinks he understands the necessary parts of Bitcoin I'd say:
-Blockchain: knowing that it's just a public list with ALL the transactions that were ever made which makes it basically impossible to counterfeit Bitcoin.
-Mining: knowing that mining is the core of the system and that without miners no transaction can go through because they're the ones verifying them.
-not your keys not your coin: pretty much self explanatory. But many people need to understand that coinbase etc could easily just close their business, take all the wallets people have been using on their site and use it for their own profit.

Wouldn't it be funny? Imagine you just bought yourself your first antminer or any other ASIC and just let it run to test it out without configuring a pool first and all of a sudden you randomly mine your own block.
Super unlikely but a funny thought nonetheless
@_date: 2019-08-26 12:05:06
Well good for you. 
I didn't have much time to work besides studying as I was studying composition, so basically every free minute of my life went into working on my compositions and almost every cent I earned went into living and surviving basically.
Also idk where you live and what the prices for a student flat were (or if you even had one) but over here your University doesn't provide you with a room, you have to find some place you can rent and they're expensive (for a student) 
Also maybe you were just privileged (or what we call "rich kid") and got supported by your parents, but my parents could not afford to help me in the slightest...
So yeah, just because YOU had an easy life as a student and weren't broke doesn't mean everyone else had to be

If they didn't lie to everyone about BCH being Bitcoin and Bitcoin not being Bitcoin I would've even bought some BCH.

Yes I get that, but there are so many people who own less than 1 BTC, so in the end there wouldn't be an entire BTC so there couldn't be 21 million people.

I still wouldn't trust an iPhone over a PC tbh. First of all apple could easily say "sike, my coins now" also the app dev could do the same. There are PLENTY of exploits for the iPhone (idk where you heard that they're secure, no device is ever secure, just like saying "Macs don't get viruses", it's wrong)
The safest thing you could do would be to code your own wallet and make it run on a raspberry pi with your own OS you wrote yourself. So you could be sure that no third party could just "download" your private key off your device. But who does that? (You would have to have good knowledge about code and stuff, not many people do)
I would say your wallet (if on PC, Android, iPhone or your toaster) is just as secure as you make it.

@_date: 2019-08-09 17:00:34
I love Exodus! And they now have trezor support! So if you want even safer you can get a trezor one (or T) and link it to your wallet, print out your seed, put it in a safe 30ft under ground in a hermetic environment and never tell anyone you bought any coins.

Yeah but you're not the the majority sadly.
Most people I know go on the internet and either search Google for "Bitcoin" or try to go to their "official" website. And the .com extension pretty much got established as the standard (most people don't even know what it stands for, they just think it means "official") over the years. 
Just take a look at the most websites people use. Google, facebook, YouTube, Reddit etc. They all use .com. even though all of them have other Extensions like .co.uk, .de, .fr etc. Most people still use .com
So it's no surprise when the first thing people try is bitcoin.com instead of Bitcoin.org

And don't say stuff like "it's a lot for someone under 30" because that's just ageism. There are younger folks out there with way more money and older folks with less. Age has NOTHING to do with how rich/poor you are.

Same here in Europe. My best friend's mum is super involved with it, whenever I go to their place she has bbc1 or some other British news on their tv, blasting at full volume so she doesn't miss anything. My buddy said it's a constant 24hr brexit marathon.
I mean sure, they're from Britain but they don't live there anymore... 
Also whenever you say something about brexit his mum gets like super mad and shoves the same opinion down my throat that the media has shoved down hers and every others... 
I love that the news tell us everything from around the globe but I HATE that they do it in a way, that doesn't leave room for your own opinion. 
Same goes for the whole refugee situation. The amount of people who voted for the right parties went up by several percent only because the media kept telling us how bad it is that we let refugees in our country.

I don't think that's entirely the fault of white men but instead SOME white men.
We should stop generalizing. There are black people who got rich and leadership positions as well. 
Maybe the proportions aren't 50/50 but it's not "white men" who decide on that. If you truly believe that you're delusional.

The average tx fee right now to have your tx be confirmed on the next block is around .58$us which basically means your transaction is getting verified in around 10 minutes on average (can be faster, can be slower, depending on how long it takes for the block to be mined) 
Bitcoin is accepted in a TON of different stores! I've even ordered food once using nothing but my orange virtual cryptocoin (talking about Bitcoin here, if you're too dense to get that) 
The average tx fee for something like PayPal on many online stores is oftentimes higher (depending on wether they use variable or fixed rates, if they're using fixed rates it's only 0.30$)
The average credit/debit card transaction takes around 3 days to get verified, however stores are able to check your balance and trust your bank to reserve money from your account before it gets moved to the stores account so you're not noticing it when shopping. However the store won't get you money for three days after you bought anything.
The same argument that I used for PayPal also counts for credit/debit card transactions for many sites on the internet.
Also since the introduction of lightning the fees and verification times basically become negligible.

Repost but I don't mind.
I'm gonna leave pretty much the same comment as the last time:

Brexit is the most annoying piece of news ever. I can't hear about it anymore and I most certainly can't see that stupid little Britain copy of Donald trump anymore.
No wonder Bitcoin is searched more than brexit. Nobody cares anymore, everyone I know's annoyed of it.

Idk why I'm getting downvoted for asking questions again. This sub seriously got some issues
Why wouldn't a hardfork not be a new coin? That's what happened with bcash and some of the other shitcoins. They got hardforked from BTC and now exist as new coins...
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:03:22
I'm in Germany and spent years in Belgium. It was the same over there. At least if you sent money between different banks.
@_date: 2018-07-24 09:27:26
Actually you can, there are many stores accepting BTC now.
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:58:16
Yeah, but as far as my understanding of Bitcoin goes is that everything is SHA-256 based and changing that would mean that you had to hardfork the entire coin
@_date: 2019-09-06 10:58:53
The audience, the announcer and the weird explosion effect at the end made me cringe but the rap was genuinely good.

Do faucets really work? I tried some when I started getting into crypto and it didn't work at all. All of them were like "uhh, yeah you technically go 0.x BTC but you won't be able to transfer them unless you got like 21M BTC" (exaggerated but you get the point)
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:52:01
I've tried mining (cloud mining and my own rig) and all it did to me was give me huge losses... So nah... I'll keep buying

Wow, thx! That's a pretty easy to understand explanation
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:54:37
Oh yeah definitely, having your own rig is expensive as fuck, but if you got some spare parts lying around and buy some gpus you can build your own rig yourself. It won't mine much, especially with the current overall hash rate in the Blockchain but it's a nice little project if you're an enthusiast for PC tech.
It won't make you any profits and even if you got everything lying around at home for some reason the electricity costs still outweigh your gains in the most parts of the world.
Unless you can get super cheap electricity and ignore the material costs, mining doesn't give you any profits. And I don't think even Chinese super cheap electricity would be cheap enough to make profits with a GPU mining rig. 
For me it's been more like a project for myself as a proof of concept. To understand the technology behind it better
@_date: 2019-09-17 11:12:28
May I ask which one you're using? And are they transferred to your wallet directly or do you have to gather x amount of coins to be able to pay them out?
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:54:48
Is that loss?
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:23:24
Probably going to be a shitcoin, however if it can be adapted to Bitcoin would be cool
@_date: 2019-09-17 10:53:52
I still wonder, would it be profitable if you made a solar mining rig? Just take the cost of the hardware aside, couldn't you technically mine for free if you were to use nature as your power source?
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:52:48
5 hours? Someone told me that chances are high to lose your bitcoins by sending without a fee, because miners will try to mine those with higher fees first and your transaction will get pushed at the far end of the list. Guess you got lucky then or I have missed a fundamental piece in the whole mining tech
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:17:13
That's what I did this month and instead of buying at 10k I bought at 8k

I had a dream like that the other day. Felt like a fever dream...   
In my dream btc crashed all the way to 30$ and I wanted to sell my fiat for some BTC but I couldn't find my credit card so I just kept running around my house searching for it everywhere but when I finally found it bitcoin had risen up to something like 2Billion$....
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:26:29
Thanks for that detailed answer.
But as I said let's not count the material costs, all your calculations are based on material costs. 
But still, you're right, it'll probably be more efficient to go to China and mine there.
Here in Germany electricity is horrendously expensive and I've heard the government doesn't like people mining... So yeah, there goes that for me...
Also, something completely unrelated to the whole cost thing: idk how gas cars and coal plants are going to work out for us in the long run, because of co2 emissions.
If we manage to reduce the co2 emission on the production of electric cars it'll not only be the future of transportation but also allow us to have a future.

@_date: 2019-09-04 10:07:08
That's where lightning comes in play. You can get super low fees with it.
Also I don't see anywhere in my comment where I called credit cards, debitcards, PayPal money. You're just inventing arguments out of thin air because you know you're wrong. After all we were talking about means of exchanging money and not about the money being used.
Another thing: getting your money from your credit card for example costs over 5€ in fees here in Europe. Tell me how that's convenient?
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:37:05

But wouldn't that mean that bitcoin's always gonna be n°1 since it's the most expensive coin?

It's funny how people always say "you watch too much porn, you're going to get viruses from it" however the most visited porn sites aren't even virus infected if you don't click any ads that say "do you want to enlargen your dick by 15 inches?" or "Hot single girls in your area want to get FUCKED" or similar
The problem is sitting in front of the screen, not the other way around. A good antivirus (and not some free McAfee bullshit) and a good using hygiene is the most important thing when using a computer. You could watch as much porn as you want and never catch a virus if you stick to well established sites like PornHub or similar.
Of course if you're into some weird ass super fetish stuff that you won't find on those sites and have to go to some weird ass website for, well it's your own fault then.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:14:23

@_date: 2019-09-06 14:46:53
The block gives you a certain amount as block reward but each tx gives you a certain tx fee, the higher the fee the likelier it is that your tx gets confirmed faster.
It's just bad wording in the article.
