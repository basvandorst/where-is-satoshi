How does Segwit lower fees? I can't find anything in your links that tells me how.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:50:57
Why does  show sub 3mb? That's not much and fees are still high.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:58:58
Why would I ever want to use this?

What does this have to do with Bitcoin? 
Just send money on-chain so you don't have to deal with that shit, since it doesn't work.

Wow. This is great. I love the analysis of writing patterns and the depth of research that went into this.
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:44:40
I don't understand how my question of asking why a banker wouldn't know what BitTorrent is has to do with stereotyping others and what it may or may not say about me.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:49:41
Yeah, reporters are looking for a catchy story with controversy. I'm sure if enough attention is drawn to it, the WSJ would do something about it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:56:29
Absolutely. I moved from Bay Area to  Sacramento to Utah, and the prices grew lower and houses got bigger

Just bought some Starbucks with this! It works great!
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:35:44
Probably a good idea
@_date: 2014-10-19 17:00:10
Our money has lost value though through inflation. Electronic banking has made it easier for banks to loan electronic money. Why use cash when you can just tell everybody they now have enough to buy a house?

What you could do is contact his campaign office and say that you and many others would like to donate bitcoin to the campaign.

I too got an invite with $10 BTC, though now it's $10.02.

@_date: 2014-02-24 04:34:44
Well it is, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:23:50
I'm sure you would lose several bits in the process, but its still the best way.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:34:57
Oh, thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:06:45
It did.
@_date: 2014-06-01 05:58:32
Its still advertising for Bitcoin.

Because they wouldn't be able to control it

The majority of my family is on android, and that's the ecosystem they'll stay at. Android is moving up in market share, and has had NFC long before Apple. ISIS mobile wallet is somewhat used in my area, and I doubt that gets used a lot.
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:51:00
Very nice! At first I went to cryptoticker.com, which confused me, until I read your comment.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:22:50
not when the politicians are older and have been in office for longer than hell, and when people continue to vote based on emotion instead of logic

I have Visa debit card, same protections. Major difference between debit and credit, credit is something you have to pay back with interest, while debit is money you put into a checking account, money you already have
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:55:51
What, like a banker would have no clue what BitTorrent is?
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:37:10
Story time.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:54:21
GPUs can though, and I'm sure people bought a lot of them.

@_date: 2015-01-13 05:37:31
People do use it...

Maybe if there was a bigger block size so more transactions could go through.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:06:04
Why are you running a node on a laptop? That's such a horrible use case for a node. Raw storage is cheap and can scale, but not in a fixed hardware situation like a laptop where you're limited. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:59:30


This part, I meant. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:49:37
On what evidence are you basing that?
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:20:24
Yes, they are. They're pushing their own idea as a compromise between bigger blocks and... Their own idea.

Says the one that literally only posts in this sub, and was created a few months ago. Very shill-like behavior there.
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:43:15
The block size needs to be increased. Too few transactions are going through.
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:45:57
Explain how it's "bullshit propaganda" then?
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:25:44
I'm not threatened by the truth because I know it's on my side. I don't have to hide behind a troll army, censorship, or have to get paid by bankers.
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:24:36
I only have one, but you seem to be an idiot so maybe that's why you think I have 3.

Using not-Bitcoin to use Bitcoin is stupid

Nice job at explaining why he's wrong!

Maybe if the block size was bigger, more transactions could go through.

What's bcash? All I'm finding is 
@_date: 2016-12-02 07:58:57
And leaving it small, preventing real transactions from going through is any better?
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:58:30
You seem to be threatened though, does someone asking questions scare you that much?
Edit: you only post in r/bitcoin and r/btc, how much do you get paid?
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:54:03
I just asked why he was replying to everyone posting, like he cares so much about what people say.
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:26:02
Why are you replying to everyone that posts here? You seem threatened.
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:29:11
It's not going to work for long if people give up on Bitcoin because it takes hours for a transaction to confirm, if ever.
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:32:01
Yeah education is a bad thing
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:18:18
Keeping it small is a stupid idea. As it is, it doesn't even need "spam" to get a full block and have a backlog of transactions. Bigger blocks will let more transactions through, keeping the backlog down.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:38:01
How does this compare to other more mainstream brokerages?
