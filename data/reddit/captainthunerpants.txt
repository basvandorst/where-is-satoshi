Then you're not very creative... 
Well, you just sit back and see everything as a conspiracy.  The rest of us will be moving on with life.  You stay here with the children.  Ta-Ta.

Cloudhashing is located in Iceland, not Texas.

***slow clap*** Well said, altkoin3d.

Good catch FinbarX1.  Problems like this are sure to become more frequent as the bitcoin community expands.  We still have a lot of bad actors to flush out of the system....

The  add up.  I'm one of the suckers that fell for CloudHashing (they suck balls!).  I've seen their hashing power increase over the past several weeks.  
If Cointerra shipped say 1,000 miners to CloudCrapping.com then the  you've posted make sense.  Cointerra said they were selling 2TH/s machines, but they were off by 20%.  Making them 1.6TH/s machines.  That's just about the same amount (1.6TH/s * 1,000 machines) CloudCrapping.com has increased!
So either Cointerra is NOW fulfilling orders to other customers or offering them refunds, but they made sure to take care of the douchbags at CloudHashing first.
This is very interesting...thanks for posting.

They can't see bitcoin as competition to their credit card business can they??  ;-)  The banks will fight it tooth and nail!  Prepare for the resistance!!!

Is there a link to the report?
@_date: 2014-02-02 07:00:14
OMG.  My eyes glazed over after reading the first 15 pages and the last 15 pages.  In total there's 80 pages...and it starts with Cloudhashing.com is a scam and ends with Cloudhashing.com is a scam.
Good grief!

I use CoinFirma and CloudHashing.  Between the 2 I prefer CoinFirma.  They seem to be more honest and straightforward.  I also like that they have a # listed on their site and they are BitPay verified.  That tells me they're a real business.
I would avoid CloudHasing.com though... I've had a ton of issues with them.

Well it's now FRIDAY and you still haven't updated my account.  You said here it would be done "before COB Monday (London time)".... another lie.
I'll start posting screenshots soon; thank you 'Jake' for posting your lie here for the world to see.  :D

Very interesting read.  Thank you for sharing.

I bought was a "1/Year" contract.  It was labeled $999 / 1 Year.   After my contract started on 1/2/2013, I noticed the termination date of 12/01/2014...(not quite a full 11 months) 
When I contacted support, they said to the effect... "Oh well that contract started mining in December so it'll expire in December".  BUT that was not listed and they sold it to me as a "1 Year Contract" and not a '1 Year Contract Minus The Time That This Contract Has Already Been Mining So If You Buy It 6 Months From Now Just Know Your 1 Year Contract Is Only Good For 6 More Months'.   Had they labeled it correctly, I would not have purchased it.  
I agree with your assertion that they've committed fraud.
Yet another black eye for the Bitcoin community.  These schemes are holding Bitcoin back and we shouldn't tolerate them anymore.  Enough is enough.

'Tahrir Square' and 'Occupy Nation' were filmed or used footage from actual real-time events.  It looks like this documentary is taking the same approach.  It's not a "retrospective" like 'The Social Network', it's a documentary about real-time events.  There's a big difference.

Honestly, you think a documentary about bitcoin is going to cause bitcoin prices to skyrocket so that someone can sell them and make a quick buck?  
Two questions about that:  1) If so, so what? A rise in price benefits all holders of bitcoin. It's kind of the "a rising tide raises all ships" theory.   2) Don't you think there would be much better ways of doing a "pump-and-dump" than taking the time to write, shoot, edit, and distribute a film?  The notion of doing a film in order to peddle a few bitcoins seems a little far-fetched to me.
Another question your raised, "why are the creators not financing their film using Bitcoins?".  Did you miss the big QR code to accept bitcoin donations?  It looks like they ARE financing their film with bitcoin.  Of course not all their vendors (say airlines or crew members) will accept bitcoin as a form of payment, but they are at least financing it with bitcoin.
I hope this somewhat helps alleviate your concerns.

Anyone who buys your "1 year contract" today is only getting 10 months!!  The 'mining period' started on 12/2/2013 but you're still listing it as a "1 year contract".  By your own admission, you're lying to people!

I still see value in mining contracts, provided that:  1) The cost isn't too high and 2) The pool they are associated with is large enough to have success (over 2,000 Th/s).
I'm taking a mixed approach to mining and buying.

The Federal Reserve is as federal as Federal Express.  
It's neither federal nor a reserve.  When will the American people wake up?

Once Jimmy Choo starts accepting bitcoin, women will flock to bitcoin like never before.
But seriously, I think bitcoin is "intimidating" to a lot non-technical people (male and female) and the explanation of how/why/what can be simplified for new users.  
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:30:35
The problem you have is this: 
On the one hand you hope and pray for widespread awareness and acceptance of bitcoin.
On the other hand you demonize any attempts for people to spread the news about bitcoin.
Cut one of your damn hands off and make a decision.  Either help spread the word or get busy calling everything a conspiracy.  People like you are the underlying problem with bitcoin.

From what I've seen this is pretty accurate; not only at a meet-up but online as well.  Sad, sad, sad.

Yes, that's what it means.  Kind of disgusting isn't it?
