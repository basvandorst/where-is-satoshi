Yes but very much more so art as it is something consumed and relative to one's place and time. The key difference is that cryptocurrency marries the P2P model with cryptography, creating a money that rise in value due to limited supply and immutability, rendering the old bank model of 3rd-party trust as obsolete. Marrying cryptography with art to maintain it's value is a futile task, as demonstrated in the examples of software and media DRMs by the other commentors in this thread. Putting any sort of wall between your audience as an artist will only limit your audience. It is my belief that art and commerce is always at odds. If you want to argue that art has some sort of inherent value then that is another debate all together.

Be careful. I had a small amount of BTC stuck on Poloniex after they shut my account off. I opened a ticket everyday and responded to my original every single day until they let me withdraw my coin. It took about a month.

You either have a piece of art that appeals to the zeitgeist or not. You can't create an artificial demand by limiting it now that there is more competition. I mean I guess you can if you work in certain mediums because look at fine art and fashion but forget it with media. It's an oversaturated market. Especally if you work in film. Many movies are churned out like an assembly line, destined to be consumed and forgotten.

You can start painting since paintings are very hard to copy but one day you'll be ruined by the 3D printer. Fortunately and unfortunately technology has made the creation and art much more ubiquitous and not for an elite select few with access to equipment and technology. That being said, make a mark as an artist to set you aside from the rest of the competition, that or sell something that is in more demand than art.

The value of art is transitory.

A cheap imitation? Yes. Legally fraud? Not really. If Bitcoin doesn’t need centralized banks to protect it then Bitcoin doesn’t need an entity to protect its branding. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:07:07
Allow me to clarify my comment. The author of the quote likens Bitcoin to a business and a corporate brand. Bitcoin is neither. Bitcoin is an open source software that serves as a digital currency. Sure Bitcoin has a logo and “brand” in that sense but Bitcoin is open source. It’s designed to be replicated and copied in every way. It’s one thing for someone to directly manipulate exploit the ambiguity between the coins as an opportunity to rob people like in the Bitcoin.org app or create a fork in an effort to sustain power and profits a la JihanCoin but you can’t take someone to court for impersonating “Bitcoin”.

I don’t know why I didn’t think to put a ticker on my watch before. Thanks.

My guess would be that proper VPN usage, multiple wallets, and mixers would provide full anonymity for most, unless of course the NSA is specifically looking for you. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:26:19
I wholeheartedly agree.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:58:40
I'm not an expert but I suppose they CAN impose laws to try and audit it but Bitcoin is definitely more difficult to regulate because billions of dollars could just be some small code on the blockchain with an anonymous address, versus cash taking up physical space or requiring a bank account.

Ha. Yeah I 100% believe that after going through the New posts the last few nights. Some people have no idea WTF they are doing here and I can see a lot of poor decisions being made.

Did you use a sufficient sized fee?
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:40:24
Lol ahhhhh
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:44:00
I bought right before the ETF "crash". I said, there's no way it can go higher now. It doubled.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:46:53
I'm not an expert but I'd say, continue to read about it, promote it, buy more, and use more for actual purchases.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:00:03
Just 100 BTC a week. No big deal.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:37:31
Bitcoin is a very complex system which you clearly don't understand. I don't completely understand it either but I assume fee restrictions were never implemented as a way to future proof the system and also as a way to not lock the system into the concept of minimum fees. Fee minimums make me think people controlling the system that are attempting to benefit. Having your transaction break by not setting a large enough fee is like true transparency to show you that you literally need the fee for the system to operate.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:44:25
I would buy a little now and save the rest for the crash, if and when that ever happens.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:51:32
There is no way to know, otherwise we'd all be rich. If you are interested in Bitcoin, I would buy some and hold on for the ride. :D
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:46:59
That's just rule  I hope everyone else learns that. Speaking of which, I need to move mine.

Storing it in your Coinbase wallet will be the same as Blockchain.info.
That being said, as mentioned, if you don't intend on using it soon I would recommend keeping it on your local machine or in cold storage because if the site you have it on is robbed there is no one to help you. While Coinbase and Blockchain.info are relatively reliable sites, they could always be hacked or robbed one day.
