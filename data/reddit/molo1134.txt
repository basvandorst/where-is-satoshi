I don't.  If someone can do this, imagine what a sufficiently motivated and well-funded attacker might do?  Say like a certain three-letter agency with a brand new Utah datacenter?

Sure, there's probably some anti-tamper detection you could do.  Like, you could run a program that whenever a hotplug peripheral device (USB, firewire) or monitor is disconnected, or network is disconnected, it automatically unmounts the crypto drives.  Also you can setup case alarms to do the same.
You could also setup a little GPS receiver.  If the GPS receiver gets disconnected, loses signal, or moves further than 100 meters from the actual location, then unmount the drives.  To counter that they would have to setup a GPS spoofing system, which isn't unheard of though.

Ham radio op here.  Packet radio is built on 1200 or 9600 baud modems on top of VHF or UHF FM channels.  The bandwidth is very limited.  That might be okay for receiving transactions and relaying to the main bitcoin network, but I wouldn't suggest getting blockchain updates over packet.
Instead consider a ham 802.11 mesh network.  With 2.4 or 5.8 ghz and ham-legal directional antennas and amplifiers you can do a lot.  See here for more info:  
However, I think you might be in violation of the "no pecuniary interest" rule:

They might not want to necessarily destroy it, but they could certainly benefit by preventing certain transactions.  Consider in the future if some countries get large BTC remittances from overseas due to local currency instability (like Argentina).  They could prevent certain exchanges from including certain transactions, thus cutting off the flow of funds and destabilizing the local economy.  Just an example.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:28:47
They plug this device into the power strip or a secondary socket on the wall outlet.  Its got a deep cycle battery.  It synchronizes an inverter to match the phase of the mains.  Then they disconnect the mains, either by unplugging the power strip from the wall or unscrewing the socket from the wall.  The deep cycle battery and inverter take over.  They put it all on a cart and wheel it out.

I didn't say the _entire_ government debt.  Right now they just change some accounting ledgers in the NY Federal Reserve whenever a transaction happens.  But a single one of those transactions would fill all of the asks on all the bitcoin exchanges combined.  Not nearly liquid enough.
