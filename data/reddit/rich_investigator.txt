Your post made it sound like you think this is the first time bitcoin has had a crash.

95% of the people in the cryptocurrency community are men, it's a fair assumption to make. Of course you wouldn't know that though as that would require you to do some research for once.


He's not, stop projecting.


Might want to calm down on the psychological projection a bit, you're reaching a bit too far there.


This looks like one of those lies women are constantly told these days, that they "deserve" things just by existing. Heres the deal though, it doesn't work like that. You don't deserve anything and the world doesn't owe you anything. Now stop being lazy and do your own research.

You might not be very intelligent, but when it comes to psychological projection you're one of the best I've ever seen, so you at least you got that going for you.

Bitcoin has had plenty of bubble poppings like we're currently experiencing before. As someone who was around during the nov 2013 bubble popping, this is nothing.

Any reason why it can't be both?

That's because Apple is a company while bitcoin is a technology. What is the revenue of the internet? (Not the companies that use the internet technology, but the technology in itself.)

I'm struggling to believe anyone can be this uninformed. If you're serious and not trying to troll, please educate yourself about bitcoin.

If he believes bitcoin will hit $300,000-$400,000 he would be a fool not to put some money in it though.

So what you're trying to say is that women aren't as mentally strong as men and thus needs to be helped so they manage to do things that come more naturally to men?
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:27:33


This is correct. 


What does that even mean?
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:48:48


So you like dishing it out but can't take it yourself? Typical. 


Fascinating how doing those things seems wierd to you. Should be run of the mill stuff for someone who's been in bitcoin since 2012, but each to their own, I guess.
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:56:06
Please elucidate the privileges that I take for granted that women don't. Also, why don't you think bitcoin is currently great?

This community is 95% male so of course it's going to be more rational and analytical than your average subreddit. If you need your daily dose of virtue signalling and emotionally laden post that don't say anything worthwhile, there's plenty of other places where you can get it. Please don't try to turn this sub into another echo chamber where everyone holds the same approved views and values and anyone who dares think differently or challenge the status quo is crucified. Diversity of thought is a good thing.

I have to admit, it took me a minute to remember what day it is. I got this note:

"We" don't actually. Some of us knows why 95% of the people in the bitcoin space are men. To find out why would require you to do some reading on your own rather than just swallowing propaganda though, so I guess it's not for you. As you say, some of us just have to accept that the exponential growth in the bitcoin space in the recent years brought with it a lot of people like you with your dogmatic thinking and lack of analytic capabilities. You're also right about not letting people like you take over the space seeing that what you want, to control and censor things you don't like, is the antithesis to bitcoin on a fundamental level.

I'm still waiting for you to tell me these things that I supposedly take for granted. Just saying that I take a lot for granted without mentioning even one example don't do your argument any favors.


Is "He has opinions that I disagree with so he's obviously on the evil boogeyman team. My political team is sooo much better than his XD"
really the extent of your intellectual capabilities? If you're out of high school you should be embarrassed. Having your ideas and values challenged should be a normal part of any adults life, no need to act like a child about it.
For the record, although I'm not american and don't care that much for american politics, I do have to admit that I find the whole sports team likeness of it to be fascinating. Don't you realize that the supporters of the other political team (or as you call it, party) have the exact same thoughts about you and your political team as you do about them and more importantly, that this is by design?
