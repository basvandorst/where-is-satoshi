They did. It was compromised.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:28:40
Processing that volume. It not triggering a halt. 
The ease of it.
If bitcoin is the future those coins will be worth 10k or more someday. Those coins just upjumped that persons life and their children's and grand childrens. 
Also bitcoin not being money. It isnt. It just has the value people place on it. Right now people are scared of insolvency so their selling. Lots of small time guys hodling 5k or less in coin might completely jump ship. That brings the price down. Ultimately though bitcoin itself is inherently worth something. You cant cheat or double spend. The immutable block chain. Its amazing. The only thing though is dont lose your key. Or store it on an exchange. Theres no legislation preventing this from happening again. Just be smart. Buy and hodl. Bitcoin is the future.

This was decided in that meeting. There would be no hard forks given a compromise. Bitfinex acted on it. No fork means the hacker keeps the bounty.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:03:45
Its fun to imagine being a winner. Of course theres a certain amount of reservation, especially given the recent hack of bitfinex but thats easily overridden. I live in detroit. Im trying to move my family onto land in the country. If im selected i would spend half on my homestead/farm and half right back to this sub in a 500 coin giveaway!  Try me.

Bought in at 300. Sold at 2k. Bought at 1300. Sold at 3k. Bought at 6k. Sold at 8k. No one ever went broke taking profit. I know the Hodl is strong, but for me it has worked out to sell at a profit. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:21:04
Me verbatim. Small amounts add up. Price can only go up. Simple supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-02-05 16:06:18
Yep. Some people want to know how the engine works some people just want to turn the key and drive. One things for sure. Millions of cars on the road. Bitcoin will be the same. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 04:43:03
Sucks. Coinbase has always been good to me. *fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:13:11
Not a shill here. I was locked out once. It sucked. Took over a week to get resolution. But I got it. Still use them. They're good and I'm a hobbyist hodler. So....
@_date: 2017-02-07 04:45:06
Im anticipating bitcoin to hit 2500. But at anytime it could hit 10k. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:53:29
I just tried as well. Have $ in my usd wallet. Can't buy with it. Weird. I was going to get back into eth but cant buy..... thx coinbase. /s
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:21:38
I actually started a small bitcoin startup here in Detroit. I solely focus on merchant adoption. We go out and teach people how to use wallets and accept bitcoin. Its a vital part of the bitcoin ecosystem. Everyone be hodlin...we help people spend and receive all around metro Detroit. Lots of integrity as I help the elderly crowd secure their coins and passwords. We encourage hardware wallets, and always paper at a minimum.
Its new. Its humble. Its vital.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:48:26
Long time hodler. Sold 40% of bitcoin for eth intil toxic debate ends. Im not alone in this thinking.
@_date: 2017-02-25 17:13:09
Only volatile in the beginning. When the price moves from 20k to 20,100 such a jump wont be felt like it is now. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:32:04
No. We focus on merchants. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:25:01
All the people I talk to seem to think 3k is coming. Probably stable at 1800 following the cash out from hitting 3k. If I woke up to hear 3k after etf....yep. If I woke up to hear 10k......bubble.
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:34:13
Cause we buckled in
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:53:33
No. I browse both. Both are good. Many people want bigger blocks. Im not a troll and i do like roger ver. Hes done a lot of good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:32:19
Yep. I love the tech and i see the potential. What motivated me to participate instead of just watch in amazement was the chance to make a little $$$. No shame in that. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:31:36
Lol. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:53:33
Segwit changes the code in a way thats irreversable. Just up the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:28:26
They did this to me too. I said fuck it and waited....it went through a week later. Even though i got an email saying it was cancelled. It wasn't. Weird but hey i got my coin. Coinbase isnt evil. They just need more staff. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:43:04
It will rally when a consensus is reached.
@_date: 2016-06-19 04:19:37
Considering how technical our interpretations of law are and how people use loopholes to get by in everyday life. You have to follow the supposed code law here in the contract. Its not governed in the same way humans are. Its the wonderful majestic decentralized coin world. Ruled by code law. Dude found a way. Its his money. Guys like this are exploiters. Just like how we exploited uranium for energy. We exploited the shit out of science itself and got a functioning space station. We have crafty minds that find ways. Ten to 1 odds this guy plays a blue deck if he plays magic the gathering.

I run a small startup in Detroit. I get paid in dollars to help people setup wallets, access exchanges, and understand the technology behind it.
We're BitDetroit. Our website Bitdetroit.com is currently being redesigned  for better ease of use. We run a node, and a miner. People love us. My biggest clientele is artists. They put their wallet address on their art and watch the donations come in. Were more like consultants and educators. 
 
Its small right now but thats ok. (Whales, feel free to angel invest ! )
Were trying to get the whole city of Detroit to jump into bitcoin. Detroit is coming back! Some days I do tech stuff, other days I go to the movers and shakers of the city and participate in community discussion. My hope is that before  council members get bad information about crypto, they will have gotten good info, consistently from us.
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:33:44
Will you own the gold and silver or will it be paper? I would go 30k bitcoin, 10k alts like pivx and monero, and 10k into gold/silver but only if you have physical possession of the gold. Get a ledger nano. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:37:55
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:37:09
Alts will fill the void.
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:33:50
I see it the other way. We've slowed because of the mass influx of users. (Good thing) The bitcoin protocol is rock solid, its why everyone likes it and trusts it. All this fear, and panic thinking is very short minded. Bitcoin will skyrocket as a store of value. It will be overtaken by alts for smaller "coffee" transactions. You change the code, you immediately lose your hodl or die crowd. You lose the trust. You might speed up the network but with new code comes new bugs. Keep it the way it is. Bitcoin is going to the moon. buy
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:48:42
Yep. Chinacoin fellas. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:20:48
Some of us make bank in alts
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:03:37
You could remove a ton of your fluff words like " by what stretch of the imagination" and not only would it remove the condescending tone of your post but it might open up real discussion. I'm certainly not in charge of bitcoin, but I have my opinions. From what I read about segwit, is that it doesn't do enough with the blocksize. It's a good solution but not a great one. Nothing I said is ridiculous. By the very word you invite ridicule. I'm just a guy trying to help the community by throwing out some ideas and support. But by all means ridicule, and make me feel small.  I forgot I was in r/Bitcoin. Thanks though for demonstrating kindness. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:25:29
No. In fact btc is essential. The 2 need each other. But alts have netted me great results. All in btc eventually but my hodlings grew a ton. Was worth the plunge.
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:34:24
Yes but lets say we wanted to go from 2mb to 3mb. But it turns out 3mb is too much, so they go back to 2mb. Thats an ideal code change. Segwit, although valuable, changes the code in a way that isnt reversable. There isnt the possibility of adjustable block sizes with segwit. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:37:29
Fellow bitbros, I launched a startup here in Detroit to promote and setup bitcoin for local merchants. Its going great, were a month or so in. My only issues are fees/block times. When will it improve? Are the Japanese having these problems? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:36:20
Insurance scam. Op hacked himself. No one leaves that much money unsecured. Too many coincidences. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:11:27
Also to be fair I went to your profile to see who you are and your very interesting. I bet we would be friends in real life. Your a smart guy. Just gotta be nice =)  
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:33:37
True, but I just launched a startup in Detroit. We're very small. I don't sell coins, We educate people on how to obtain and secure them. Hosted wallets is a no no for us. We're small but helpful. Just do your research and hold your own coins.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:31:46
I know these problems. I am merely relaying the questions I receive. I explain to merchants block times and fees, security, how to move coins, etc. These are the things they ask me. I'm curious as to how the Japanese are solving this at a merchant level is all. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:59:55
Backwards compatable but not reversible. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:56:37
Maybe you missed what I was trying to convey. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:13:38
Satoshi is likely a conglomerate. Im willing to bet craig was either part of, or knows enough members to consider himself part of, that conglomerate. It allows for both his passion and sense of validity as well as the unshakeable shadiness that permeates from him. He doesnt have those coins. None of them do. They all have a piece of the seed password. He can never prove he is satoshi because he isnt. Hes just a limb.

Mining centralization is happening anyways. We need bigger blocks. People mining at home upgrade your  equipment. Segwit changes the code substantially and irrepairably. You cant go back if its bad .Just increase the blocksize to 2. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:42:02
Its a difference in vision. Im with roger on this. Fees are too high. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:57:21
Actually, I do. I run a startup in detroit that helps setup merchants. We show them how to accept bitcoin, store it securely and join the network. All of them, literally all of them, tell me they need lower fees to make it work. Bitcoin was supposed to be for everyone, the rally cry of decentralization. But now, it seems just like a store of value and not something that the world can use as currency. Bitcoin has become a savings account, instead of a new paradigm in money.
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:07:53
I have change all the time that sits around. If I were to be adding it to a bitcoin/coinstar at my local retailer, pretty soon my accrued $15 might have grown to $20. For the average person its like putting money into something similar to Paypal, but with the possibility of a return. Something that might motivate the average Joe to get on the bit-bandwagon, especially considering how evangelical most Bitcoin supporters are. It would cost just...change. Might even be a slogan in there too somewhere.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:36:01
I like roger ver. I know this community can be toxic, but we shouldnt be posting just to take a jab at someone. We as a community can post better. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:19:12
Even after a 10% per dollar fee, thats only $1.50 out of the original $15.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:15:19
Recommendations? and does this work like SETI, in the background?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:49:05
Sort of, but without begging for just the currency. I think a puiblicly available, continually updated list of Stores that accept bitcoin would be incredible. Also, by sending things in tangible form for bitcoins would help strengthen the economy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:34:59
GPU and not CPU?
