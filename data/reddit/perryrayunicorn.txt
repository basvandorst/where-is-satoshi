Is this the legendary imineblocks youtuber?

Ok thanks. Being able to learn from it is good enough for me.

So is there any significant advantage it brings taking into account that my funds are stored on a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:05:03
It’s the reason I was able to buy the pc in the first place so go ahead.

@_date: 2018-07-25 02:14:10
Lol I think I’ll go for that. Thank you for your response!
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:01:25
Thanks man idk why everyone doesn’t believe me. ATM’s do make mistakes too they are not perfect.
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:28:06
Where is this?
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:01:21
Dope. For a second I thought u put (oc) for Orange County. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:14:02
To clarify all they do is check the atm and if it has more money then it’s supposed to I’ll get my refund
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:54:50
Yeah that’s a good idea because it’s adds the the mystery of who put it there and that perfectly represents bitcoin and it’s anonymity. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:18:40
Thank you
