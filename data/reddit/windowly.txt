Pretty cool comparison.
@_date: 2015-12-30 08:14:22
Balanced opinion? It reeks of condescension to me :(
@_date: 2015-12-19 02:56:31
I think Gavin has dealt pretty soundly with this objection here:
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:46:33
I don't but we will soon need to.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:15:28
His age is the same as Satoshi's.
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:29:53
Wow thank you ! :)
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:09:07
Will you be putting most of your bitcoin on it? How easy is it to use?
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:31:34
This is why we need cheap or almost free transactions. We should be able to tip whoever we want without censorship.
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:04:01
Yes, use blockchain.info with a good strong password and 2FA enabled. . . 
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:11:21
Hmm. . . we got to encourage people to send bitcoin to Electrum or Multibit or blockchain.info (secured with 2FA). . . this is the second post where someone tried to download the core and send bitcoin to it.

pay taxation or pay taxes?
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:12:11
I would use a hardware wallet, like Trezor.
@_date: 2015-12-30 03:59:53
I agree with your thoughts. 


I think if we did that, Bitcoin, as well know and love it, could be saved.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:18:51
His age is about right (similar to Satoshi's)
@_date: 2015-12-22 14:25:09
Yeah, none of those descriptions make Lightning network out to be specially wonderful so I was wondering what the hype was about.
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:38:00
You lost more than 2 million dollars? I'm so sorry. :(
@_date: 2015-12-01 05:14:30
[Vaultoro]( for for gold. 
Although, [I've heard that they're going to add silver soon](
@_date: 2015-12-10 09:11:35
I hundred percent agree.
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:22:58
This is from 2013. . . what has changed since then?

That means Charlie Lee  was wrong as well. He went on and on in his article about how we have to pay soldiers to keep the castle, and if the castle got bigger we we couldn't pay less yada yada. . .

Check the list of 500 top computers in the world -- his is no. 16 or so and it's called Tulip.
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:22:33
Very odd. Very interesting.
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:03:22
ah yes!

Even seven cents is too big of a transaction fee.

He could sign a message with one of those addresses.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:44:38
Wow pretty interesting development.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:00:50
I really like blockchain. Try out their alpha.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:35:28
It's funny . . . my scores are the only not hidden. I should be burned at the stake for daring to mention the unmentionable.
@_date: 2015-12-11 09:11:27
Wow this is great news. Congratulations Bernard von Nothaus!
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:09:47
Yes they do. It depends how old the bitcoin is.
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:38:12
Let's scale the blockchain with BIP 101 so that we can cope with all the transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:01:04
I use it all the time. Have you tried their alpha?
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:29:08
He deserves the money for making bitcoin what it is.
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:49:55
Isn't it?
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:04:08
pretty discouraging :(
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:06:10
In 99% of the case yes. In a few cases if the court orders them to freeze the account (because of connection to gambling or donations the court doesn't like, perhaps) they will freeze the account.
@_date: 2015-12-02 03:59:26
This worries me, even though I would never trust Bitcoin on a windows machine. . they're way to leaky.
Still I trust that my macbook pro doesn't have any viruses. Maybe I should be more careful.
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:06:26
Oh I didn't know. It's just the title of the original link.
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:31:29
Not for me. kk I'm an old time bitcoin user.
@_date: 2015-12-19 12:15:04
Hahahahaha We didn't know miners were competitive before? Isn't the whole idea of bitcoin to have competitive miners?
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:28:39
It seems the Wired article forgot to mention that  twitter profile also mentions Tessier-Ashpool 
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:37:44
I op-voted it. I do think it is a very valid question that should be addressed.
@_date: 2015-12-30 06:39:49
People have to take responsibility for their positions.
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:47:50
what is your 'strict definition of consensus'?
Your ideas of consensus seem to shift with every moving tide of your inclinations.
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:36:08
Don't keep your BTC in coinbase. It's nice having your transaction costs payed for but not worth it because your account can be frozen.
@_date: 2015-12-19 12:49:18
Three useful threads to help you come to a decision on that:
AMA with one of the creators of the Trezor:
AMA with another of the creators of the Trezor:
Discussion of advantages and disadvantages:
I've been very impressed by how responsive both of the main people responsible for the Trezor (Alena and Marek) to concerns and questions. You can find them on Twitter as well and ask them questions if you have any questions you can't find the answers to online.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:03:38
It's volatile with respect to the US dollar but it is never volatile with respect to itself. If you have one bitcoin you always have 1/21 million of the bitcoin pie and that value will never be devalued.
I'm not sure why more people are not using it as the best kind of off-shore banking? (Not that I would ever encourage anybody to do anything illegal.) Still, if I wanted to diversify my wealth and put some of my wealth in an untouchable place where it is inalienably mine, bitcoin seems the perfect option.
@_date: 2015-12-11 10:16:00
Oh. What are your privacy concerns?
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:27:34
wow really interesting
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:10:22
Try Blockchain alpha's wallet. I really like it and use it as my goto wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:49:22
The mod policy is inherently confusing and contradictory; so I'm not surprised you are confused by it.
@_date: 2015-12-02 16:27:33
Excellent article.
This is definitely the money quote:


Read the whole article though because he looks at the situation from several different angles and a miner's perspective.
@_date: 2015-12-19 00:17:57
@_date: 2015-12-11 09:59:22
Get a Trezor and use it for your funds. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:01:08
Post on the other bitcoin forums as well (  
@_date: 2015-12-24 05:03:06
Me neither.

It's just what I wanted to say! Censorship can give a very strange impression of the world.
@_date: 2015-11-30 10:05:35
He started a cool forum recently as well: 
@_date: 2015-11-26 06:07:48
This would be so amazing. Perhaps it will help the industry and miners to coalesce around Bitcoin XT.
