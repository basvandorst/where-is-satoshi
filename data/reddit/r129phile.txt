If a small amount of inflation encourages investment and economic activity  does a large amount of inflation encourage more ?

You know your history. Can you explain this ?:
1930, noun and adjective, from German Nazi, abbreviation of German pronunciation of Nationalsozialist (based on earlier German sozi, popular abbreviation of "socialist"), from Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei "National Socialist German Workers' Party," led by Hitler from 1920

Thankyou for your thoughts.
How do you explain "a pretty shitty human being" can end up running a country ?
And  which countries do you think have "a free independent press" ?

Thanks for that. It just gets confusing when people who call themselves Socialists are the exact opposite. Do you think lack of economic success  makes it easier to spot the deceivers like Maduro?

If the dollar didn,t decline people would be less likley to invest in property. This would mean house prices would decline. Rents and mortgage payments would go down. People would have more money to spend. That would be a good thing for the people and the economy.

Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

So I have an up to 1 in 10 chance of being affected by hyperinflation. Thanks for the reassurance. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:04:48
You,re right - more like 11 %.

I have noticed that some economists do not embrace bitcoin. Although to be fair one I know personally seemed interested in it when I told him about it in July 2015. It was the first he had heard of it. He works for the UK government.
