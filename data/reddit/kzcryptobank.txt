The bitcoin fell to $ 16,800 yesterday, today $ 17,800 and that's a panic. Imagine yourself on a roller coaster and just relax. The price will soon return and conquer new peaks !!!

We all hope for growth. Even new currencies, who buy, also hope for growth. I created my project on the ICO. Nerves are darkness. I want to do everything honestly. Let God go. And bitcoin will continue to grow. The main thing is to have a competent investment plan and not to go into depression.

How much I use the wallet has never been bad.

Favorable moments were always there and will be. Many projects now that bring a solid profit

After 50% correction there will be an increase. And the network load will drop and everything will be as before

Good night. Good dreams

It sells some assets and buys others. Competent investment plan. I am happy for him.

I'm currently working out that even in a car wash and in toilets you could pay any crypto currency. It's hard of course, but I'll try

Reset bitcoin early. But the alternative is that something can be chosen. I like bitcoin. And the fact that it is now going on, it's all temporary. Soon everything will settle and it will again with other crypto-currencies go to new heights

The new bitcoins will soon be. I made a partial contribution to the ICO. In the end, get the maximum profit. Always invest with a cold head. Good luck everyone

Do not lose anything by investing in other crypto-currencies. But the main thing to keep in bitkoyne. The difference in the basket is 60/40% approximately

Bitcoin is the driver for all crypto currency. New crypts smoothly follow the father of the founder. As for investing, it is better to invest in those currencies that cost from $ 0.3 to $ 1. Then in half a year, who lost a lot will return everything and with profit. And bitcoin is a huge hole in the world of finance. Of course this is purely my opinion

CryptoBank will issue a gold coin to everyone who invests in the pre-ICO stage and the total purchase of tokens will be more than 1000 KZC. Please rate the design of the site and say your opinion. Thank you

A good fund. I applied but did not respond. I had to do everything myself.

Insider trading allows you to buy or sell once and then live in chocolate. My opinion
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:46
Do not worry, now the network is overloaded. Once everything is restored, everything will fall into place. A little patience and all.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:24
Panic for no reason at all. Sooner or later everything will be restored. If it's so scary to opt for another crypto currency or invest in ICO. Nothing happens for no reason. We all learn from mistakes.

Invest in clean water. !!! Correctly does. I shake hands when I meet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:36
Everything will be fine. Do not worry. Ask me if there's any need.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:45:09
Bitcoin is a great topic. And I'm with both hands for him. Thanks to the creators for this opportunity to the world. And who has disgraced him apparently lost much.
The future for the father bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:23:55
Sincerely I wish you happiness. Competent investment will always lead to the goal that he created. Good luck and success.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:45:40
Nothing tragic happened. Market fluctuations of bitcoin are standard. For a long time there was no correction by 50%, after that to conquer new peaks. Good luck to us!!!

Dear !!! That you hate bitcoin so much, yes it's in a difficult situation, but it's not a reason for panic. If you are completely tired from waiting, transfer the savings to another currency. I exchanged a part for company tokens, part for ether, but I keep the bulk of the money in bitcoin
