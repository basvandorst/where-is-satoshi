I bought my first BTC this week (well 0.00768062 BTC/£20).  It's up to £25 now, and I'm pondering getting more.  
So yes, but these are high risk investments in my opinion.  As far as I understand the market is pretty much built on a hope and a dream currently, a strong hope and dream.  Time will tell if this turns into a usable currency.

No, I think that is a genuine and valid question in this case.

Seriously, I'm brand new to this.  Coinbase made it feel easy and normal.  
Let me get on the ladder and sort all the more complicated stuff out later.

It's 612 days.  So 6120 raw investment.  So 6.5x or an increase of 5.5.  until late December BTC was worth about 20% of its current value.   As such most of the investment occurs at a very low price and will have gone up over 5.5x.  the next 5 months will have gone up between 5.5x and 1x.  Every over the last 3 months will be 0-1x.
12 months &gt;6.5x (with a peak of about 16x).  
5 months at 6.5 to 2x.  
And 3 months at 1to2x.
The vast majority of the money would have been invested at a very high roi.

I disagree.  Some very intelligent companies will allow the option of BTC to get the BTC fan boy niche, but exchange at the lowest rate for the past week or so (or 10% below market value if that moment is the lowest point for the last week).  Then they will instantly trade back to fiat for instant profit.

But that wasn't it's intent.  Let's say the whole website thing didn't take off for what ever reason so publishers never lose their grasp, the internet still offers plenty of other useful applications, email probably being the most prominent.  I can easily imagine a world where email is a thing without websites being a thing.
The internet is more like the tubes of the utility companies.  It's just moving data instead of water or gas.  The internet is more comparable to the blockchain; bitcoin like is email or websites or like one of the countless other things we do with the net.  It is yet to be seen whether it is an email or something more niche or something useless.  
Useless bitcoin finds away to address a number of issues (transaction speed being very top of that list, transaction fees being second) it doesn't stand a chance against fiat.  And as far as banks go, it needs much higher security for the average user to offer utility.

The difference being the internet wasn't trying to replace anything in particular, it was just a technology.  There wasn't an internet alternative, it worked or it didn't.  The sub parts of it grow and die.  
Bitcoin has direct competition in the form of fiat.  It has to be better that fiat overall and at least match for a couple of attributes (like speed and cost of usage).  If the internet was slow there wasn't another option that was quicker; if bitcoin is slow you can pay in fiat.

There is a lot of potential for the blockchain, far beyond coins.  For example, universities are investigating using it as a way to verify degrees.  
Also, the comparison is being made from a developmental standpoint, not a utility standpoint.
With this, you can compare things that are a part of each other.  Like comparing how departments within a company work compared to how the company works as a whole.

Universities are talking about using a block chain to make degrees more easy to instantly verify.  You don't need a coin to have a block chain.

I state the same elsewhere.  The blockchain is a better comparison to the internet, bitcoin is better compared to email and similar techs.  I was replying to someone who used the internet (as many do) as a comparison.

And allows the fan boys to go "look you can spend it on real things".  It's win win really.
