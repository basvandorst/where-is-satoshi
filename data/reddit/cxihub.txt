Yes you maybe right but it need more investment to do that and anyone cannot risk his money in bank coz bank are closing accounts.
The way way premium is beacuse of regulation and thats it beacuse banks are not supporting cryptos.

Hello as per rbi regulation on 6th July all exchanges bank accounts has been closed. Due to this there is less trade happeing. Market has demand but sellers are forced to closed bank accounts and most of them are working on hit and trial. Soo thats why the rates of bitcoin in india is higher than international rate.

Thats a small sentence. He will be out in 2 years and find his holdings double triple. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:06:05
These kind of people don't understand how hard it is to develop something around crypto. Due to the price fall many startups got effected and many of them have vanished or trying to survive the crash and waiting for the next bull run. We also come around users like this always who only complains rather then help in anyway! Users should report bugs, suggest solutions instead of posting reviews like this. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 12:56:47
Wow! Seeing adoption of bitcoin gives me the best feeling ever!

I feel soo sad for the people there. No wonder bitcoin is booming there. Localbitcoins.com has most traffic from venezuela. Bitcoin has always been the safe currency that gets famous in any county who's currency devaluates. Just like it happened with greece. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 12:49:52
Non believers are not welcomed  lol :P

@_date: 2019-05-31 06:23:14
Man this wave can't ride no money! Spend all on my crypto startup :/ 
No worries when the rate goes up crypto VCs and investors will have their pockets filled with money so we get funding that time.
