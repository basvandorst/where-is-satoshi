Here, just read the appellate decision affirming the sentence:

You're incorrect. I'm a criminal defense lawyer. You do not need to be convicted of something for it to be relevant to sentencing. The judge merely needs to find that it occurred by a preponderance of the evidence (not the usual PBRD standard) and can factor it into his decision, which is precisely what occurred in Ulricht's case.

The judge is not bound by the prosecution's recommendation. Unless there is a statutory minimum or maximum (i.e., the law itself requires you get 5 years but no more than 20), the judge can do whatever he wants, including sentence you to probation. However, the district judge's sentence is always appealable, by both the defense and the prosecution, for unreasonableness. If the judge gave you probation on a murder, the prosecution would appeal; if he gave you life for tax evasion, the defense would appeal. The appellate court would then adjust the sentence. 
To your second question, the technical answer is yes - you can file a writ of habeas corpus, attempting to challenge your sentence, but this would be unlikely to happen and less likely to succeed. First, it's rare that other crimes are proved to be untrue; but second, judges are always careful to couch their sentencing language (as this judge did here) to suggest that they would've given the same sentence regardless of the aggravating uncharged crimes. That said, it is certainly a very interesting legal question and would present an interesting challenge to any lawyer that found a client in those circumstances.

Sorry, didn't see your reply earlier. YES, the judge has to make a record of his findings (though not necessarily written, he can say them on the record when sentencing). In this case, it's important to note that Ulbricht's sentencing guideline recommendation was life, JUST FOR THE DRUG CRIMES. The judge did not need to rely on the murder-for-hires at all. He did discuss them in his sentencing but was careful not to overemphasize them, and the appeals court found that it was proper. Actually, what the appeals court found was more problematic was the fact that the prosecution offered evidence at sentencing of 6 people that died from drugs they purchased over Silk Road; the appellate court found that to be problematic and too attenuated from Ulbricht, but did not change the sentence.

SO mine now works and I get $7500/wk. maybe it has to do with the income you put in or something? Are you buying in now or waiting until Monday, see if it falls further?

Is there any fast way to buy bitcoin? I signed up for Coinbase, Xapo and BitStamp on Monday and none of them have verified me yet, and I've missed +10% gains already. Who knows how long this is going to take with the deluge of people trying to sign up. Any work around?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:01:57
Yes I found one that would let me do it but it was like 150 euro max, I'm trying to buy in much more. I'll wait until I'm authenticated, maybe the price will fall to something more reasonable anyway.

Yes, maybe this 2-3 day waiting period will work out for me. Coinbase is suffering from a "degraded performance" on its platform right now, it states, and who knows how long it will take. Xapo also doesn't seem to be working very well. These platforms probably weren't built for the insane demand in the last two weeks.

Great, I'll check them out, thanks!
