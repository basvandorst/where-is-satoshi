If you don't pay your taxes then the government will get curious.
Probably all the $10k+ deposits into people's accounts are getting reported to the government, and probably that includes where it comes from. So if I ran the IRS, in May or whatever I would run a query to find the total Coinbase deposits for each person, order them, and check out the highest 10,000 of them to see if they claimed capital gains. Or bump up their "audit me" score a little maybe.

A non-logarithmic graph is quite poor at showing trends of a value which has passed through a couple others or magnitude. For example $1 to $2 is the same amount of change as $10,000 to $20,000.  But on a non-logarithmic graph which includes of those ranges, the $1 to $2 change would be basically invisible.

Someday I want to do the math of how many of those one million would be knocked out by the multiples of 21 coins that reside in large addresses. For example an address with 210 Bitcoins in it would knock out 9 additional people, so a person with 21 coins would know they have more than at least 999,990 (or 999,989 or 999,991???) people.

Sure, I could research which ATMs will meet my quantity or variety needs or I could walk into a branch.  One of those certainly seems easier.
The only ATMs I have seen with deposit functionality are large bank branded (Wells Fargo, etc.) and I presume are only able to deposit into that specific large bank.  Maybe Schwab or someone has these fancy ATMs placed across the country?  Or maybe there are some that allow depositing to any bank?  It would be news to me though.
I am not aware of other businesses that provide a service similar to safe deposit boxes.  But maybe there is...again, it would be news to me.

BitcoinWisdom website, and it shows trades on the Mt. Gox exchange.  Trades are done off the blockchain.  If you withdraw bitcoins from Mt. Gox then that is a transaction that would go on the blockchain.  Until you withdraw them, your USD and BTC balances are just numbers in Mt. Gox's database recording that part of Mt. Gox's USD (in a bank somewhere) and BTC (on the blockchain) pools of money are yours.

If you hide anything well enough it will be lost forever when you die.  For example you might hide a roll of hundreds inside a speaker cabinet and not tell anyone.  When the speakers are old/damaged they will be tossed out, never to be seen again.

The problem with all these places starting to take Bitcoin is that each transaction I do is a tax event.
Buy something for $10/0.02857BTC?  Now I have to keep track of that as a conversion of my investment to USD.  And then figure out what lot they come out of (LIFO), and pay taxes based on that lot's cost basis.
This is a huge hassle and it keeps my BTC spending to a minimum.  And even if I earned BTC (through Coinality or something) I would still have to keep track of all of this.
So, I don't really see how BTC purchase volume could ever become large without a change to the IRS stance on BTC.
Edit: Actually I do FIFO--not sure why I put LIFO.

The upstream peaks are relatively insignificant because that is just someone downloading historical blocks from me as fast as my connection allows.  I'm sure if I had a 20mbps upstream that it would peak at 20mbps.
The 1.2mbps upstream average is a function of my available upstream bandwidth.  If I only had 2mbps upstream then I'm sure that my node would still forward new transactions in a timely manner.  It would just send historical blocks less quickly to new nodes.  Those nodes would get their historical data from nodes that do have more bandwidth available (I don't think there is a current problem with nodes getting historical data quickly enough, otherwise I would see 10mbps peaks of much greater length).  And I expect that the average utilization over time on my 2mbps peak node would be much lower than 1.2mbps.

If you are a business like Coinbase you don't want to actually hold any Bitcoin (other than customer deposits, which aren't actually Coinbase's property). Just like the NYSE doesn't actually own the shares which are traded on it. So any buy on Coinbase has to have a seller somewhere.

The only revenue that the government would lose if Bitcoin takes the place of cash is new person to person stuff (Craigslist sort of stuff...wait pretty much no-one pays tax on that right now anyways).  Any business has to comply with the sales tax laws.  Any business has to comply with income tax laws.  Boom there are the government's major sources of revenue.  Anyone that buys a car in a private sale has to pay tax when they do the title transfer (at least in my state).  Also anyone (damn near everyone) that doesn't want to take care of their own Bitcoin security because it is too risky (just like having $20k of cash sitting in your house is too risky) will have it in a bank, which will be regulated and subject to AML/KYC.

Based on the information I have read about the attack, yeah I think someone could exploit a flaw in chase.com's registrar and change the DNS configuration in the same manner.
My HTTPS certificate knowledge is pretty shallow as I have only worked with it a couple times so maybe chase.com has some better setup for that?  I think I remember reading that the attacker somehow got a cert for their server and the bitcointalk.org domain signed by a cert authority.  Can't find that now.  Another easy way to harvest passwords once you have DNS control is just have your clone of the site not use HTTPS at all.  Only users that check for HTTPS in the browser bar or have extensions that warn for that sort of thing would notice that they are sending their password to the attacker.

I think it is likely that their rolling buy limit is a result of how much risk they are willing to float.  If they have $500k in buy orders from the past 3 days (waiting for ACH transfers to confirm) they might not be willing to take anymore as there is some risk that the floor would fall out of the Bitcoin market and people would try to cancel their ACH transfers.  This would cause them to lose massive amounts of money as I assume since they lock in your price that they actually buy your Bitcoins from Mt. Gox when you click the Submit button.
Also it is possible (but not likely IMHO) that their buy limit restriction is their attempt to "do good" for Bitcoin in the long run.  Imagine how much more the price would have spiked if Coinbase had allowed purchases to flow freely.
Your theory is plausible too.  However, I think Coinbase has many more buyers than sellers which would cause one of my two theories come in to play anyways.  And, I believe their actions over the past few months support my first theory.  Especially when they allowed more buy orders without locking in the price--this carries no float risk for them.

Creating their own registrar would be the only one of your 3 proposals which would have prevented this particular security flaw.  The auditing and security team would do nothing.
The forum money was only worth $1 million as recently as a month ago.  I don't have much subject matter knowledge on what it takes to form a registrar or what the requirements are but it wouldn't take that much to put it outside of the feasibility of theymos' (former) budget.  So 30 days ago it probably would have seemed unwise to dedicate even 10% of the available funds to running a registrar.  (I don't even think larger tech companies do that themselves...banks don't, etc.)  So they spend $100k on being a registrar.  Someone qualified to work on security critical registrar infrastructure probably bills $300/hour so have them spend 40 hours (low estimate) on it: 12k gone.  It looks like the minimum fee to ICANN per year is $4000 plus some other variable amount.  Shit, $100k would be burned through within 5 years I bet.  Setting up a registrar with only $1m in your business would be super dumb.
So now that we are talking 6x more money this month?  The money side might be more feasible, but it would still be a very non-standard security move.

Cloudfront isn't as big as Akamai so it is quite likely that they use Akamai too, with a long-term goal of eventually switching over.

Depends if they are cache-able pages and if you can distinguish the DDOS requests in order to not serve them non-cached pages.  If you can't, then your CPU is going to get overloaded and you won't be able to serve the correct dynamic pages to customers.

I am still emailing them trying to get all my transactions that got cancelled to show up again. But other than the goofy fraud detection algorithm it is a great site.

Taxing Bitcoin is pretty much the same as taxing USD. Any business operating legally reports relevant financials (sales for sales tax, wages for income tax) to the government. How would using Bitcoin instead of USD change that?
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:30:03
Basically they did not explain shit.  There are two issues causing the grief:
* Why are the transactions always cancelled right at the end?  And then once you email support complaining they give you the coins really quickly...well that means either they already know my bank transaction went through, or it means a frauder could email support to complain and get the coins without paying for them.  Makes no sense.
* Why are people that have had several successful transactions getting flagged as high risk when it is the same bank account that has paid in the past?  What makes the 4th purchase (same bank account, same 10 BTC size order) high risk?
Neither of those were answered.  In actuality this is just a lip-service PR post that doesn't say anything other than that they have fraud-prevention algorithms which are fucking people over.
Don't get me wrong, I have done many transactions through Coinbase and would be completely satisfied...but I hit this rejection issue that I feel has a lot of room for improvement.

Wrong.  The reward will only be something like 0.0001 bitcoin at that time anyways...or even less.  And there would probably be a shit-ton more people mining, which decreases your odds.
The correct answer is to get transaction fees.

7200 RPM HDD does ~100 IOPS (nicely matches my 100ms figure above but they are not absolutely correlated)
A consumer SSD does on the order of 50k IOPS, so can easily handle 4000 tps.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:12:59
At current max block size of 1MB and with a new block every 10 minutes (3.3 tx/sec given an average of 0.5KB tx size), it will grow 52 GB per year.  This costs about $2 to store on a 3TB HDD at current market rates.
Currently the network averages only 1 tx/sec.  So usage can approximately triple without needing any changes.  When the block size problems are solved, it can go to go to 165 tx/sec and still only cost $100/year to store.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:09:22
Currently there are only about 70,000 transactions done on peak days, so it would be a massive increase in transaction volume over what the network has seen so far.
Transactions sizes range from 0.2KB to 1KB and average 0.5KB so a million would enlarge the block chain by 200-500MB.
The scalability "starting goal" is 4000 transactions per second (verification rate on clients, this is not mining speed) so 1,000,000 transactions would keep a decently powerful quad-core loaded for about 5 minutes.  However if a computer doesn't have enough memory to keep the block chain in-memory it would probably be screwed for a couple hours seeking on the HDD.

They do something like a credit check...a couple weeks ago I did one of the additional verification steps and it asked me who has a lien on my car and what my previous address was. This is information that I believe would be on a credit check, and I never gave them this information before that.

Then the DDOS would require you to turn on a ton of machines to deal with all the requests (if the bottleneck of your web site can even scale to more machines) leading to a massive service bill.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:19:52
Hmm you have a point.  It is possible that such a meaning was the intention.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:13:50
They have to provide an API to traders, so who is to say the DDOS isn't against that API?
Though they should issue API keys and drop any keys that have too much traffic.  So they are still worthy of getting some blame.

Run the numbers.  For example I have an AMD 6970 that has a hashrate of 380Mhash/sec and Bitminter says I am averaging 0.044 BTC/day.  At $60/BTC that is $2.64/day and since my electricity is ~$0.12/kWH I am pulling in about $2.40/day.
It would take about 90 days to pay off the purchase of an AMD 6970 which currently goes for $200.  In that 90 days it is likely that the difficulty will increase quite a bit so you may never break even.  This is why people say that you should just put your money into buying BTC instead--because even if the USD/BTC price keeps going up to keep my mining income higher than electric costs (makes sense for me to keep mining), you don't have that sunk cost on a graphics card already.  I already had my graphics card for gaming so it is pure $2.40/day profit minus some risk of my graphics card getting fried.

* Language choice makes little difference in an application as small as Mt. Gox's.  It's all about the architecture.
* I don't think multi-cast (which is packet-level multiplication) is widely used on the Internet, though I don't know the technical reasons why not (the Wikipedia multicast article gives some good hints).  I have used it on small networks to image workstations but I think it is way more common to use CDNs for Internet stuff.

In the past 24 hours there have been two other drops of the same magnitude as the one you see in the past hour.  It is insignificant.

Facebook handled tens of millions of simultaneous users with nary a hitch before they did that cross-compiling magic (but used other languages for some components).  With smart people a PHP app can do fine.  For example, whitehouse.gov uses Drupal which is PHP.

I am inclined to say no because I have done some complicated stuff in it but if you restrict yourself to the same feature-set that Mint offers then it's probably pretty close.

0.05 is worth $3.60 currently, and if your electricity is $0.20/kWH your 300 watt computer is only burning $1.44/day.  It's profitable if you already have the hardware, but if you buy a graphics card today it will probably never pay off due to the coming difficulty increases.

Businesses like Mt. Gox don't just let anyone invest in them since if they are putting in the effort to start the business they want the ownership and profits to themselves.  If they need more capitol then outside investors would be one way to get that but often tech businesses don't need a lot of capitol and can bootstrap themselves.
Creating POS terminals is something that requires business connections, a solid vision of the future, and many skills (software, hardware, retail, and sales for starters).  Not many people have all those skills or know the right people, and if they do then they are probably driven individuals who already have plenty of things going for themselves.
Basically, those two things are not easy to invest in.  Buying Bitcoins is comparatively easy.

A) Bitcoins are not currently infinitely divisible.  Each transaction is an integer amount of Satoshis.  No Satoshi fractions are thrown out in a valid transaction.
B) Sure Gavin (and a few others?) can make changes to the reference Bitcoin software.  However, if it is a negative change, someone will probably notice and make a lot of noise about it.  Then the majority of people will refuse to install that version.  A minority that does upgrade to the new client will be on a smaller blockchain which will have no value.  Everyone who is invested in any way in the Bitcoin ecosystem has an interest in only running versions of the software that are healthy.
