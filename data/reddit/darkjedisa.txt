People react to bitcoins like an investment. The reason why people are so reluctant to use their bitcoins as currency can be attributed to many factors.
1. scarcity: Everyone knows exactly how many bitcoins there will be ever.
2. Lack of liquidity: Right now you cannot move bitcoins as easily as paper money. 
3. Unpredictable market: Who wants to be the one that gives off their 10,000 BTC for a pizza, also who wants to sell their products for BTC when the next day they are worth 30% less that what they were when you sold your products or services?
Scarcity cannot be changed so lets try and see what needs to happen on 2. and 3.
Bitcoin needs to be accepted for every purchase worldwide to be 100% liquid, the closer we get there the more valuable BTC will be because of the scarcity.
BTC needs to have some way to minimize the swings. 30% gains and losses only serve as a road block for people to want to buy and sell products using BTC.  Once we see slow and steady growth of about 3-5% year after year (keeping up with inflation) we will see more purchases made using BTC.

The best way to start investing is to start with a little bit at a time. Put in 10 now, but next pay check put in another 10. Slowly your roi will grow with what you put in. The trick is not to pull out and try to time the waves.
