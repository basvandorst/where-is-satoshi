I ended up getting all of my money and was able to transfer it out. You will have to wait until the funds clear before sending your money out of coinbase. Really frustrating and stupid.

Looks like you can still get your pending transactions as long as you dont close your account yet. Also from my reading you have 90 days to move the funds.
Hopefully this info is still accurate:

Yes, I wanted to switch some funds around on GDAX so I created an account there, and for some reason I am now getting told I have to close my account. Not the end of the world, I just want to know about my two large pending transactions.

No clue and Im guessing they wont tell me from what I am seeing online.

Agreed 110%! Please people do not store your money on Coinbase!

After logging into my coinbase account (yes the correct link, no phishing) I am now taken to page that just says Close Account and I can not do anything other than transfer funds off of the platform:
"Unfortunately we have had to close your Coinbase account. Before your account can be closed, you will need to withdraw your funds to an external wallet and any other funds to an attached bank account. Please be sure to delete any references to digital currency addresses generated by Coinbase, as funds sent to those addresses will not be retrievable once the account is closed.
