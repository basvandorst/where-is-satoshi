Yeah okay yeah there is no information on the site yet. It's under development. In a couple of days I will release the website with a forum. 
As for begging - No I'm not, I'm asking for donations for people who are interested. People do not have to donate and they may want to donate at a later date. It's completely up to them. I'm on here mainly for suggestions and too spread the word. 
I understand fully that there is no more information for my project. But there will be later on. 
Sorry if you feel that way, but me and many people have put a lot of work into this and are very passionate about this.

Personally I don't think that they will recover from this. It's upsetting that many people lost money, for something that shouldn't have happened. There was too much lost and to recover.  Bitcoin will move on from this I'm sure. The community will stay strong like it always does.

Yes, I will be giving the game for free as long as the 'wager' side will be able to sustain the running costs.
Initially I was going to release the game at a price without the betting aspect of the game, but with these two aspects i think will be good for the competitive players who want to make a little bit of money.

Yeah well that's the idea. Although not everyone will want to gamble a lot of coins on a game or tournament. So we thought of having separate lobby's where the ante if of various amounts from low - high. 
Also for people who would not want to gamble at all, a non-gamble zone.
