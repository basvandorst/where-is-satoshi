Another day in paradise aka the land of smiles. Let's hope it stays legal here

@_date: 2019-11-06 06:56:09
Lol... good luck with that. You're not the first to try, and you won't be the last to fail.

Get a Trezor for peace of mind.
@_date: 2018-06-02 02:27:17
They no longer accept Bitcoin? I no longer accept Expedia. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:48:37
I bought mining equipment twice already and a Trezor.

No. Bitcoin dotcom is a bad choice. They will try to fool you into believing that bitcoincash is bitcoin. It's their agenda. I personally use a hardware wallet. But that comes with some cost, and depending on the amount you want to invest in bitcoin, it might not be worth it for you. It's the safest storage though. Have a look into Trezor and Ledger in case you're interested.
@_date: 2018-06-02 02:38:29
I just read about that somewhere else here on reddit. Checked on Expedia myself then: no crypto mentioned as accepted methods of payment. Annoying!

I can recommend the Trezor One
@_date: 2019-12-14 16:50:40
You might wanna try on the sub buttcoin ��
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:34:22
Will help you "eliminate" the way? That sounds like a threat. The poor way! 
I'd give it another try with "illuminate".  The way himself and Facebook might approve that. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:37:38
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:00:16
Yeah! Sounds like a brilliant plan. I might get into trouble as soon as she demands to see and try the honey though :)
Nice off topic lol

We obviously watched the same video about that Florida guy, and this video popped up in my mind today after reading your last post. I agree that metal should be the safer choice.
Florida has a comparable climate as I remember from my past visits. I'll see what I can set up on our terrace that gets approval of my girl too ;)

The vulnerability has been long fixed by Trezor. So no. None of them is safer than the other. I use a Trezor, and I do so with pleasure. But if I were into more alts, I might pick a ledger as well. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:54:13
Wow. Good that you were at home when it happened, could save your crypto and - most important- get yourself into safety. Sorry to hear about the damage and all the trouble this causes you though. What you said about a proper backup strategy can't be stressed enough. It applies to everything digital and that includes crypto.

I'm sure you are using Android and other Google services. They earn money with your data. 
Microsoft sells services and software as well as some hardware. Calling windows 10 spyware is a bad joke.  
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:52:10
Scammy? Bitcoin.com says it all.
How irritating that the screen on the ETH machine says "Buy bitcoins". Good thing is that the bcash machine is out of service. It won't be missed I guess.

I feel you. I have a few cards mining here as well. Made sure there is enough ventilation, but in the tropical climate here the cards get really hot no matter what I do. And they are heating up my condo more, while I'd rather have it cooled down a bit. Thinking about putting them outside, but then I have to secure the setup against theft. Still seems to be better than taking a risk of a fire. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:05:53
Exactly. In certain circles it's obviously a requirement to be anti Microsoft. I can speak as a German who left to Asia about 11 years ago and do agree about most of what the op said. But the windows part is plain stupid and ignorant. I'd rather use Windows than Linux and especially Android of any sort. And I used them all in the past. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 04:04:57
I'm surprised that nobody suggested yet not to use bitcoinDOTcom.
Sorry for your loss mate.
@_date: 2019-09-02 04:49:27
Sh..t! They were reliable. Never had any issues with them. They will be missed.
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:57:42
You were holding XRP ��

We should really appreciate the man. He is good for bitcoin.

Thailand blocks websites that are regarded as a threat to the monarchy. They also block porn. Since trading crypto is legal here you should be fine. I remember having used Coinbase a few years ago without issues.

Sorry. I won't do business with you.

The Deutsche Börse Stuttgart recently published an app called "Bison". Might be worth a shot.
Viel Glück!

This ole scam pops up again and again. Just don't click.
