Yea, I wasn't sure Bitcoin was a bubble until I started reading the propaganda on this subreddit. The delusion is hilarious.

Right, but you're assuming bitcoins will become scarce. There's no reason for merchants to adopt it aside from a brief raise in sales from their bitcoin press release and there's no reason for consumers to use it as a medium of exchange unless they're doing something illegal.
Scarcity depends on demand outpacing supply. If it does, we'll likely see a deflationary spiral. If it doesn't, then bitcoin fits a niche for black marketeers.
And I'm not here to berate you, just make sure to read up on the causes and effects of "delusion".

Did you even read the article you googled? The banks themselves don't offer anything. You make a deposit to a specific account owned by ExchB.

You can take this post as an microcosm of what's happening to bitcoin. People are getting into not because of Bitcoins ingenuity, but because it's a skyrocketing investment. Unfortunately, there is little real value in unsustainable growth.
Unless economies really begin adopting bitcoin as a serious payment system and not just a speculative commodity, it won't increase in real value.

No problem. That'll be 17 BTC plus tax.

You're being downvoted because there's a lot of kids on here playing "investor" with &lt;$1000, most probably with &lt;$100.
It makes me laugh seeing the order book for BTC on Mt. Gox. At such low investments, wouldn't any earnings get eaten by trade fees and bank fees?

If you're this fragile, you should quit while you're ahead.

I'm not sure "inevitable" is the right word. Maybe you were looking for the phrase "my wet dream".

People keep saying that, but is there any evidence that it's the largest computer network in the world?

If he's hoping to make money, he should look into stocks and bonds. Bitcoins are currently overvalued by everyone trying to make a quick buck.

Yea you're getting played. Pay back in AUD.

Are you seriously short selling BTC? I could not think of a worse decision.

Obviously you ultimately do what you want, but hoarding bitcoins (an effect of deflation) does negatively affect the rate of adoption by merchants. What business owner wants to experiment with a payment method that no one uses? On the flip side, if CVS hear's that 7-Eleven is making a larger and larger percentage of it's sales through BTC, it is more likey to adopt it as well.
People think that just fetching a higher and higher price for bitcoin is good, when really price should be a lagging indicator of adoption. Right now it's not, which is why BTC is so overvalued.

I'll cite your lack of economic reasoning and flurry of anecdotes as a cession that you don't really understand business management OR market research. You're regurgitating the same points without assigning a value to the benefits. I don't care if there are 20,000 merchants on bitpay; show me how bitcoin has increased their international sales or if the reduction in fees covers the cost of currency exchange.
Then, relate that to their core business model. And tell the US Great Depression that deflationary spiral is a myth.
If you're [brought to tears by witnessing this "movement"]( I suggest you get a hobby. You're delusional.

You have over $140,000 invested in a highly volatile bubble? Talk to a financial advisor ASAP.

I would seriously pay back those BTC immediately or you'll end up owing them $150 by the end of the week.

It's still an option. LocalTill and Bitfloor do this through a BoA account, but you wouldn't go to Bank of America and ask about bitcoin options. They wouldn't know what you're talking about.
