They aren't sending out orders or answering emails. Although this guy's post says that they're refunding, I've emailed multiple times and not received a refund. He was also continuing to market the site despite the issues the site was having and lack of delivery of the product until a few weeks ago until he went dark until today. Some people bought stuff from their site two months ago and haven't received any communication...so that seems pretty scammy to me.

I ordered a month ago and haven't received anything, and I've been on multiple threads with people who ordered as far back as August who also never received anything. I have emailed them to follow up multiple times, eventually asking for a refund - I received no response. straight up ignored people who who posted about that until today, and he made that bitcoin post marketing the site 3 weeks ago, which I replied to, and he never answered. He may not be purposely trying to scam people, but he marketed the site on here multiple times even after these delays started, and he's seriously downplaying how much money he got people to give his business for nothing in return.

Dude, why are you continuing to market this site? As other people have said, many of us have ordered from the site (at your suggestion on Reddit) and have not received what we ordered or any communication as to the status of our orders. I have followed up 4 times with no response, and the 7-10 day delivery window has long passed.
