So... why is this a bad thing to you? I genuinely don't know.

I like Warren Buffett, but this is disappointing.

That was a **fantastic** podcast. Thank you for doing that; the number of eyes you opened today (especially on the Rogan Board, which I frequent) is high. Pat yourself on the back. The ripple effect is coming.

Wait, what did you reply to...?

Ehhhhhhhh..... fuck. All I want is to buy today &amp; feel comfortable. Now I feel like I'm going to end up being forced to buy at the high on Friday before it crashes back down to reality.
Damnit. 
Locally I don't see them for under $880.

Nobody really knows. Is this the ground level, or will it crash back down to "reality"? Seems to me like it's more likely the former. I'm looking for BTCs to be at $100k or more in 4 years. That's the long term investment opportunity I want.
EDIT: Even if it does crash, I wouldn't sell. I would expect it to come back up. As far as I'm concerned, I missed my chance to get rich quick.

I just cancelled my buy I made earlier @ $650. 
Going to wait for this bubble to burst, since it seems I wasn't going to get my BTC until Friday's market value anyways, which is probably going to be much closer to that peak. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:01:05
Well, I suppose that's relative to what I can afford to invest. At $1 per BTC, it was a real opportunity for someone in my shoes to invest a lot, and see a ridiculous return present day. At $1000 per BTC, it's a bit harder to get in and a bit longer a turn around, even if I could. 
I invest what I can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:26:45
Yeah, I just wish I could have them today, instead of Friday @ $1000 or whatever I expect it to be at.
And even then, I guess I'm ok @ $1000, so long as they continue to climb. 
I'm not sure today was the best day to get on board.... or maybe it was...
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:40:13
It wasn't so much that I was worried about - it was the steady rise expected this week, and the fact that I wouldn't be locked into my buy until Friday, at whatever Friday's market rate is. 
I've since purchased without the issue at the current market rate (they appear to have lifted the halt on buys), which was what I wanted all along. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:28:55
I got instant verified, but I still have to wait until Friday according to my buy.
$580.50 for 1 BTC, but it says it will complete on Friday, Nov 22nd. 
Sigh.

Coinbase, and sure it's safe, assuming you trust Coinbase's security. There's a reason we pay transaction fees.
But realistically, you'll have to give your bank account password to Coinbase once for verification, and after that, you can simply change your bank account password again so that whatever *was* on file with CB, will no longer work. 
Although, I doubt they keep users bank account passwords on file past the verification process anyways. 
Another option is buying locally off Craigslist, but from what I've seen, the prices are a bit inflated. And meeting for such a small amount of Bitcoin might not be worth their while (unless, of course, you're willing to pay inflated prices). 
I'd just go with Coinbase if I were you.

Stop it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:44:34
When they were halting the buys, yes, it gave me the option. In fact, the number kept going up. The first hour it said I had 15 or so minutes to cancel the order.
Then two hours later, it said I had 6 hours to cancel. /shrug

Awesome. Sorry to ask, I'm sure it's been answered before, but what do you sell? I'm a big supporter of hemp.

So, I just bought some bitcoin on coinbase, but it said it won't be in my account until Friday. 
"Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Friday Nov 22, 2013 at 01:00PM PST after your funds have arrived."
So if I bought 1 BTC @ $500, and on Friday they're trading at $1000, that means I'll only get 0.5 BTC?
