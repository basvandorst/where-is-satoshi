Thx for the link. I appreciate it. I have been in ethereum for a while so i know how it works. ( using MEW ) just want to get some people that are acquainted with the Bitcoin world opinion before making a decision. Dont care much about how the interface looks.

Story of my 2018 crypto investment
@_date: 2019-11-12 23:24:43
thx. Just in the last 100yrs Germany is in its 3rd currency so it wouldn't surprise me
@_date: 2019-11-12 19:30:36
Do you have source for 27yrs? I know all Fiat does eventually, but 27yrs seems very short

Same here, I love blockchain tech and wish it to do well and replace the way we do things in many different sectors but this post is silly. Gold has been around for thousands of year as THE number one money and it will be around for many many years. Bitcoin will inevitably die at some point due to better blockchain tech coming up and the more it is accepted the more research and development will come into blockchain. (For exemple I dont think anyone still use internet explorer) and as far as value goes (besides the fact that no one needs electricity or any device to trade gold) gold as never lost 90%+ of its value, in fact the price of gold just keep going up

I respect your opinion and agree with most of what you said. I got to say first that I hold BTC and hope it will do well. 
When I was referring gold has THE number one money I guess I wanted to point out that through the ages and the different type of governance the human went through gold as always been one of of the most valuable things you could get your hands on. It is by no means practical.  Bulky and heavy... hard to split into small fraction. But nonetheless a very good store of value through the ages. (I guess we’ll see how the S&amp;P 500 will hold on if we get hit by a massive recession) 
The thing with BTC is that at 7tps it has no case for being a efficient global currency in our everyday life. Depending on how the lightning network will help with decongesting the network, they have wayyyy more work to do in order to make it practical for BILLIONS of people to use it on a daily basis. 
I would respectfully disagree on other crypto being useless. I like very much the idea of smart contract which BTC can’t provide. 
 I think what will happen in the near future (thats only my opinion) is that if it become used by the masses it will be something in the lines of a centralized blockchain which the government have complete control over. (Which is scary coz by then it will be very close to be living in the novel 1984) They have been wanting to get rid of physical currency for a long time and I think blockchain will give them just that. I dont think any capitalist government will ever let us have complete financial privacy and freedom. We have to remember that they control the power grid and most of what the crypto world is running on. We probably can buy a few things with bitcoin but the essential (rent, grocery, bills) has to be paid with our good old paper money.
