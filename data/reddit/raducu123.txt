Have you seen the history where it crashed from 1000 to 250 and took several years to recover?

Wouldn't you still pay the miner fees when you close the channel?

Here's a prediction (which I've seen in some plots by a trader's bubble detection tool which correctly predicted bitcoin would top ~mid december ):  bitcoin price will simetrically decrease for at least the next 3 months or so, to where they were 3 months before the crash.  
My prediction 1 March 2018 bitcoin ~ 3900$.

Speculating: the previous price increases were caused by smart money, people who actually believed in bitcoin, darknet markets and so on; the last couple of months were just regular people who bought something because it was trending higher and when that will fail to materialize, they will move elsewhere, just like anything else financial: a couple of years ago it was OIL, stocks, gold, now it's bitcoin in the spotlight.   
Crypto won't dissapear, and IF someone come up with a currency that is decentralized, cand do 100.000 transactions per second and has a STABLE price compared to other currencies/goods/services, then yes, the SKY is the limit.  
The hurdles ahead are enourmous -- not only technical, but economical.   
Bitcoin without inflation CANNOT maintain a steady price in a growing economy, hence it cannot be used as a currency.

There is no such thing as a "store of value" -- it all depends on WHEN you bought  it; you can buy overpriced gold and overpriced bitcoin or overpriced stocks.  
There are moments when gold outperforms stocks and moments when oil outperforms stocks and moments when soy outperforms stocks.  
There is no investment that outperforms all others in perpetuity because market forces quickly move the price of the overperforming investment vehicle up until it no longer outperforms the rest.

NO country ever will back their currency by gold because it's such a terrible idea.  
In a growing economy gold as currency would cause deflation which is bad for the economy.

What is your magic formula to predict stock prices?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:43:09
Unfortunately it will happen a lot more often because cryptos remove the part where the police catch you when you pick up the money.

Fiat money is stable enough to be used over time. People using it know it enough for their needs.

Bears(that actually make money) are people not good at picking an uptrend but very good at picking a down trend -- they make money by shorting stocks when their correct intuition tells them the stock is going downwards because of all of the hype in the news.    
Bulls(that actually make money) are optimists about the VALUE of the stock -- they buy early because they see future potential; they are not good at picking the downtrend but it doesn't matter because they bought very early on, they can take a 50% price drop and still make money.    
Pigs are people who think they can perfectly time the market; in reality they buy after a 10x price increase in a year deluding themselves there's another 10x increase just around the corner; pigs will buy at the top and will panick sell very close to the bottom

As far as I understand it(I'm on page 4 of the witepaper), both parties of a chanel need to lock up the same amount on their side.   
If I open a 100$ channel, the other party has to put in 100$.  I cannot buy more than 100$ and I cannot receive more than 100$ on that channel; or more accurately I cannot have a balance of more than 100$ in either direction.  
If I want to receive my 10000$ salary, I need to lock up 10000$ in a channel and only then can I receive my salary via LN; furthermore, my employer also has to lock up 10000$ on their side.   
I'm sure you'd reuse a couple of channels, but unless you arange with your employer that they pay you small amount every day, you cannot just reuse the same channel indefinately, because you cannot realisticaly rebalance every day.

Because everybody wanted to sell at 20.000 . That's why you sell at 19000

Why does it matter so much?   
Wasn't bitcoin going to replace the banks?  
Wasn't it expected that the system would push back against bitcoin?   
Wasn't bitcoin adoption going to be organic, serving people's needs, regardless of good or bad press?

Funny that you mentioned 1 year ago when your reddit age is ~130 days and your only comments are from this thread.    
Also funny you don't name your employer but you want some love for the guys in a tweet.  
Me, being the paranoid fuck that I am, would say you are shilling for that website.   
Also really funny how cryptonaire claim to be in business since 2010, but their website was registered late 2016.  
  
"Cryptonaire is the first cryptocurrency research and forecasting firm that takes pride in understanding and being the leading source of research and forecasts in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry since 2010" -- riight.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:47:41
My paranoid view is that op's story is complete bullshit and he's just shilling for the cryptonaire website hi graciously provided in the link to the tweet.

It's convenient to quote Satoshi when he predicted dedicated hardware for bitcoin mining, but not when he described bitCOIN to be a coin, riight?

I used to believe there would be hyper inflation because of the QE done by central banks.  
There won't be any, because all of the money went to the pockets of the 1%. They are not going to use that money on consumption goods.   
The 1% are using that money to amass property, luxury items/art, means of production, stocks and so on.

No it won't stabilize, because it can't "stabilize" -- bitcoin is not a stablecoin.    
Gold price is not stable, why should bitcoin be stable?    
You want to have a constant temperature in your house.  
Bitcoin = heat in your central heating system in your house.    
You cannot control the weather outside (world economic output).   
Guess the only way to regulate the temperature in your house?  
That's right, you have to pump more heat in the winter and remove heat in the summer --- i.e. you have to be able to print more bitcoin when there's more bitcoin demand and destroy bitcoin when demand for it slumps.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:09:17
But isn't LN irrelevant now that bitcoin is no longer a currency and just a store of value?  
I mean, why do hodlers need LN for?

Maybe he tried selling OTC and maybe there weren't that many people willing to spend half a billion freaking dollars on an asset that already appreciated 2000% the past year.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:08:54
It's almost like we need a central bank sucking up money when there's too much and printing some when there's too little in order to achieve price stability...

I have emails from coinbase rejecting my id when bitcoin crashed to 250$.    
I wish I was more persistent.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:19:03
Delusional hypocrits.  
So the lawyer should have sold OTC bitcoins so not to hurt btc holders but he also should have crushed the fork coins.

Credit/Debit card fees come with insurance, it's a very good deal for the average consumer.   
There's absolutely no technical reason credit card fees won't go lower in the future.   
Given the same legal constraints bitcoin will be always be more expensive than centralized-trust-based systems.  
The real benefit will be decentralization, but the average consumer won't care, and governments will be against it for very good reasons.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:31:35
How about the fear that without credit we go back to the middle ages economy-wise?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:04:13
That's a very good question.   
No big government will allow a foreign currency if it wants to have a saying in monetary pollicy.   
Probably some underdeveloped places would be ok with cryptos, but not any major government.
