Coordinating hard fork in those conditions would be a nightmare.

For Alcor you're going to need upwards of 400BTC ($200k) but can arrange to have that paid for by a life insurance policy, which is what I do.

This has been going on for 49 mins as of now.
Situation seems to be that the REST API has stopped updating, WebSockets API seems to be ok.
BitcoinWisdom, for example, looks like a flatline in price and shows a massive wall, variously of 909 BTC, 862 BTC or once I saw it give ~1050 BTC. But I don't think its really there, at least not now.
When watching BitcoinWisdom it looks like once its loaded its using the streaming WebSockets API and you get relatively up to date market data. Refreshing it and all that goes away and you get the flatline. My own tools I have monitoring the REST API are getting very out of date data with no transactions. Getting some positions data but not sure if its accurate.
My guess would be many people using the bitstamp API have not detected the failure and are trying to arbitrage across multiple markets, this may or may not be working out for them.
From the history, if it can be trusted, it looks like a big wall came in to play that ate quite a bit of the orderbook. My guess would be that this crashed some part of the system and broke the API.
FWIW: Their site is still processing orders, but you won't see it on the API. Expect some angry users after this.
EDIT: Getting 500 / Internal Server Error when trying to trade.

Tell me about it

Hi Gavin,
I think thats a really good idea.
We would also need to adjust the actual block reward to 1/10th of the planned reward so that we still reach 21000000 on schedule.
On the subject of the block halvings, how would you feel about gradually ramping down the block reward instead of having a sudden halving every few years? I do not propose that we violate the 21000000 limit or the general principle of reducing block rewards over time, just eliminating the sudden drops. I am concerned about the sudden and unpredictable effects on BTC and mining markets.

I think it would be pretty tricky to dump them on a market and not eat a full orderbook. Also, any reputable exchange would surely block the transaction if they know the coins are stolen.
Tumbling that volume would be hard too.
The 'best' course of action, I think, would be to slowly siphon it off in very small chunks and tumble that, only cashing out what you need month by month in order to have a nice life. Or hope to find enough merchants accepting BTC that you don't even need to cash out.

I think it's because miners who would usually sell on Bitstamp are just holding back until the exchange comes back online. 
If/when it does come back I expect they'll have accumulated some big stashes to sell off so it will seem like the 'good news' is pushing the price down.

Maybe people will even get excited if they end up holding some of the funds that were stolen. Like how people look out for serial numbers from D. B. Cooper. [
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:22:03
I'll be doing the same. I don't know which force will be the larger though.
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:04:16
The problem is that even if there was an open-source codebase for an exchange, there is no way to know that that is what an actual exchange is running and they might have modified it.
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:58:12
You're right, but, from a legal perspective I'm not sure they could ignore it.
I am not a lawyer but I imagine that it would be like if someone stole a bunch of cash from a bank or a car from some member of the public and the serial numbers were released by the police, I think you'd have to do something if someone tried to pass them to you and even if you came into possession of said car, there is still a legal mechanism for it to be returned to the rightful owner.
Obviously in the wild west that is Bitcoin things don't always work that way. I just can't see any reputable exchange (ie, any exchange with enough volume to handle 18k BTC without just running off with it themselves) not doing anything as soon as someone deposits these coins with them.
How much it is in their interest to extensively track them as they're moved about though is debatable and if we follow this to its logical conclusion then it destroys fungability if not all coins are equal which would be a very sad day.

I'm not saying you are wrong about insider knowledge but here is another angle. Say you realised that you could raid the Bitstamp hot wallets, it's going to be a one time thing because once you've done it the hole is going to be closed.
This seems a bit more likely if it was a weak-RNG attack vector, since if you realised that was the case you aren't leaving any traces on Bitstamps servers that might get you discovered before you can pull the heist.
Say that Bitstamp were regularly sweeping excesss funds into cold storage, if you run the attack at the moment you discover the vulnerability then there is a risk that you won't get that much (relatively). You might as well wait until there is a good amount of BTC to steal.
The best course of action would be to wait for a bunch of BTC to be deposited at Bitstamp and then execute the attack. The price would likely go down just beforehand, because afterall, someone has deposited a large chunk of BTC and is now selling it, pushing price down, but you run the attack before the coins are swept to cold storage.
Not saying this is the case but something to consider.
The price now rising I suspect is in part because of some regular sellers (miners, etc), who sell through Bitstamp not doing so and just waiting for it to come back up. At which point I expect price to go down on the 'good news' that Bitstamp is processing again.
Further to the idea that it could be an RNG issue, the bug might not be immediately apparent and require extensive debugging and rewriting which could explain the delays in reopening the exchange and "Don't use old deposit addresses".
I too will keep buying BTC though, I like your analogy about cash in the wild west.
