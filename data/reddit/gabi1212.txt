You have it backwards, millions have been burned trying to keep the price up this year. With the mining supply of 1800 new bitcoins per day there needs to be around 12million new dollars coming in to keep the price going up from here.

Basically the price is only high because of new people coming in and older ones not cashing out. If everyone cashed out the whole thing crashes. Which is what OP is saying when he says that holding is keeping the price of bitcoin up.

What would the interest rate of a loan with bitcoin be? Like what would change?

You are not encouraged to hold USD though, because of inflation you are better off spending it or investing with it. That's exactly why a lot of crypto people don't like fiat because it doesn't increase in value just by holding it. Everyone spending their money doesn't crash the dollar.

Telling people to hold isn't doing bitcoin any favors though, one of the reasons bitcoin was growing so well was because everyone was using it as a currency and buying things with it. All this holding is just stagnating it. If you want bitcoin to grow you should encourage people to buy and sell things with bitcoin since that gives it a actual purpose to own that isn't just a investment.

What does that have to do with bitcoin or any topic in this thread. Don't have to be so mean to the poor guy.
