You should stop talking such useless nonsense or you might actually end up believing it.

And you're not a supporter of bitcoin as you're consciously denying someone's freedom to use them as they wish. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:48:46
That's not true. The world in general is much more peaceful than at most any time previously. Your casting doom and doubt will only worsen your outlook on life and thus affect your interaction with other people, dragging them down as well.

Ok you're mental or something. Transferring bitcoins for goods/services/currency is *obviously* related to bitcoin.

You're doing exactly what any foolhardy investor should learn to not do; get excited. Clam up and keep your cool.

I've put tens of BTC, thousands of dollars, through MTGox but lost nothing because I withdrew all my business from them a year ago when they started delaying account withdraws. 
The sign's been on the door for months now.
Also, I never invested cash money in BTC. That's a fucking stupid idea. I CPU mined everything forever ago.

Lol, does he have followers? Alt accounts? How did this get negative votes?

Hi, welcome to 6 months ago. Anyone who's surprised at mtgox is a dumb dummy dumber than dumb dumbhead dummkopf who should know how dumb their dumb little dumb heads are.

I love you, buttbot.
&lt;buttbott&gt; I stupidly had my life's savings in bitcoin, and when the price started to butt, I conbutted to buttlars and watched the price buttmet. I lost $357,000. Not to try to butt a bunch of sympathy or butthing but this was not only my money but it was going to be my 5 year old son's education fund which i took out of fidelity about 1 year ago to mess with buttcoins.
P.S. mtreme, you should let your son disown you.

You have no grounds. You're an idiot for trusting your money to a Magic The Gathering website. You don't understand the risks of BTC exchanges. There is absolutely no literal definition of "Trust" with these exchanges. Quit being a baby and accept the fact you made a bad investment.
Your logic would put the same level of trust in a Nigerian email scammer; wiring money to someone you don't even know with absolutely no insurance.

Why are you sympathizing with the idiots who left money on Gox? You wouldn't sympathize with someone who gave $10000 to a crack dealer on a street corner and expected the dealer to "come right back with their product."
I like the rest of your letter, even though it's all obvious observations anyone who considers investing should already stand by.
Good job at being a drama whore.

This isn't I don't see the point of this post.
@_date: 2014-12-02 22:25:49
This is why nobody takes the internet seriously. Or, if they do, it's because they're an idiot who can't say no to a pedantic argument.
Please stop the madness. Please give up. Apologize and move on.

Uhm, what about the concept of banking days and waiting for a balance to CLEAR, not just be available? Haha, you were gamed by someone smarter than you. Enjoy your learning experience.

You're brainwashing yourself. Never bet the whole farm on any speculation. Going all in on BTC is a freakin' stupid idea no matter how the future looks.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:51:29
A proper example of how to invest in BTC. Only do so when its outcome won't affect you either way.

I READ YOU 5x5 GENTLEMAN. WHAT ARE YOUR ORDERS, SIR?
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:10:45
You guys have the same problem as the  people. You're blinded by pride. Do something to improve the climate. Something more than bolstering your own false confidence.

And this might be the best advice. Educate people and keep them from making foolish decisions. Like Festivus, we can rally around and tell each other stories of Bitcoin deals gone wrong. Maybe upload YTs of goxees crying.

 ALL THE WAY DOWN!

A lawyer that sympathizes with their client? Never heard of that before. They're probably appalled by their own per diem rates too, huh?

Run away to Russia as soon as you can. You're totally fucked. RUN. RUN. Don't worry, you'll fit right in. There's lots of people there who have no grasp of reality.
