If you opt to prune all but the latest gigabyte of block data, then that is still thousands  of (&amp;amp;lt;1MB) blocks you will be able to relay to other nodes.
I hope that eventually you'll be able to specify a percentage of older blocks that it will randomly keep as well. If 100 nodes have a random 10% of old blocks, then there's a very high chance that even though they are all pruned nodes, someone could get the full block chain from them.

Most successful private torrent trackers use a combination of upload/download ratio, and bonus upload based on amount of data seeded and length of time seeded (e.g. 50GB upload credit for seeding 2TB for a week even if you didn't upload anything).

Also, don't expect to use a pruned node on your home machine as a wallet either, because the release notes state wallets and pruning will be incompatible until some future update.
To recap, if you prune blocks, the limitations of that node are:
* you can't relay blocks (will be fixed later)
* you can't run a wallet (will be fixed later)
* you can't query it for any tx info if the tx was in a pruned block (inherent limitation, will not be fixed)
* going back to full-node-mode requires re-downloading everything, even if you kept the latest 90% of all blocks (may or may not be fixed later)

A node has a copy of the blockchain and sends it (or pieces of it) to anyone who needs it. A miner verifies new transactions and hashes them with some metadata in the hopes of finding a new block and getting paid the block subsidy and transaction fees.

That's incorrect, though. Valid transactions are propagated through the network in seconds, but they stay in a node's mem pool until a miner puts them in a block, which can happen many minutes later (or until they expire because the mem pool got too big and the transaction priority was too low).
I understand what you're trying to get across, but saying that zero-confirmation transactions are in the block chain but reversible is like telling young children that you can't do math operations like 3/7 or 6-9 because the only numbers that exist are positive whole numbers. Maybe white lies are what Bitcoin needs?
@_date: 2014-08-27 07:22:37


I'm surprised no one has corrected you on this, yet. You're confusing full nodes and miners. Full nodes don't use 100% CPU, they just relay information (like transactions and blocks) over the Bitcoin p2p network. Miners have a full node running and then send over some of the data (difficulty, previous block hash, Merkle root of transactions, etc) to special hardware that mines. The efficiency of the mining hardware has *nothing* to do with processing transactions at all.

First of all, addresses are encoded using [Base58]( which explicitly prohibits some of the characters you used to try to make the addresses seem similar. Both of those address have illegal characters.
Second of all, the last few characters of the address are a checksum. Change or add or remove any random character and the chances of the resulting sequence of characters being a valid address is a few *billion* to one against.
Finding just a few characters to change near the middle (and good luck finding two characters in base58 that look similar in any widely used font like Helvetica, Comic Sans, Arial, Times New Roman, etc) but keeping the first 5 and last 4 characters the same while maintaining a valid checksum is a Herculean task. And actually owning the private key whose matching public key is hashed into that address is even less likely. Here's why: to get a similar looking address that isn't just a black hole, you need to base58 encode the hash (SHA256 and RIPEMD160) and checksum of a public key... which is formed by applying elliptic curve cryptography math on a private key the malicious actor came up with. The required computing power to reliably pull off such a stunt more than once every few billion years doesn't exist. Even if the bad guy wants to make a black hole address because he gets off on people losing money without profiting himself, it would still be extremely unlikely to find a valid address (keeping in mind clients won't even allow a send to an invalid address) with very few changes that still "looks" the same.
TL;DR: This is not a problem.

Remember the one with the bad RNG which meant a white-hat hacker had to clean up their mess?). Yesterday's block size stress test also revealed their mempool data is worse than every other mempool info website (e.g. tradeblock, blockr, statoshi, etc). They still don't provide a way to use their site offline for when they have "scheduled" maintenance. Their block data sometimes lags by hours which can lead to poor customer experiences with merchants who rely on BC.i's services. They also try to conflate their name with the actual Bitcoin blockchain which easily leads to confusion among those new to Bitcoin. I think there was drama over their coinjoin algorithm at one point, too.

For anyone too lazy to use Google to get around the paywall:








The New York group expects to debut three or four trials of the ledger in trade processing in the next 12 months, in a move that Bob Greifeld, the group’s chief executive, hopes could radically reshape some of the US’s sometimes cumbersome and slow-moving market plumbing.


Mr Greifeld told the FT he wanted Nasdaq to be “a leader in the field”. He added the network could potentially revolutionise the time it took to finalise deals on US securities markets from a maximum of three days — known in the industry as “T+3”.
As a public, distributed ledger, the blockchain acts as a central repository for details of all bitcoin trades, though it could also be used for other financial assets.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions are validated based on a mathematical formula running on the computers of volunteers, allowing assets to be transferred without using a centralised agency such as a bank or a clearing house.
“I am a big believer in the ability of blockchain technology to effect fundamental change in the infrastructure of the financial services industry. Clearing houses are a wonderful invention, but if you have a public ledger that is trusted, you can evolve back to a bilateral (trading) world but proceed with instantaneous settlement. We currently settle at T+3. Why not settle in 5-10 minutes?”
Shortening settlement times for trading could reduce the risk that counterparties would not be paid, while also cutting the amount of collateral, or insurance, used to back trades.


For the Nasdaq Private Market, using blockchain means transforming the recording of transactions from paper certificates and spreadsheets to an audited record of the lineage of ownership of private securities.
Although Nasdaq is exploring its use in post-trade services, other groups are also turning their attention to bitcoin and its technology. Nasdaq’s rival, the New York Stock Exchange, this month said it would launch the first exchange-calculated and distributed bitcoin index. In January, NYSE made a minority investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet and platform.
Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who helped develop the idea behind credit default swaps, has joined a group of trading executives setting up a venue that will convert buyers and sellers of financial assets into bitcoins, thus cutting settlement times.
