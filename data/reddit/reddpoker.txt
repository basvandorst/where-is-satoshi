I don't understand the sensationalism here.  I went back and read about 2 pages of the forum stuff.  
You had the following:
A guy was deliberately using up the full clock every time it was his turn admittedly to tick people off and cause an advantage for himself.  This is rude, irresponsible and just bad play.  Any live poker room would kick you out in a heartbeat for doing this.  No reason this site admin should feel or have to act any differently.
Also, The admin stated that if he caught someone using multiple accounts on the same table (obviously illegal activity at any poker site), he would lock their accounts and possibly confiscate their funds.  No different action than any major poker site would take.   This thread sounds like it was created by the guy that got ticked off at the admin for not being allowed to exploit the site.
I personally have played at betco.in poker and although it's still very small and the game and table selection extremely limited, buggy at times, etc., I have no problem with the admin's actions in these cases, and would encourage them as well.

And now here is the actual quote:
CptCoin seems to have some kind of agenda to bad-mouth the admin and site.  Perhaps he's the guy that was accused of all this.
In the quote below, the admin states(his english is not great) that he would lock the account IF it was determined they were using multiple accounts at the same table at the same time..  clearly illegal on any poker site.
