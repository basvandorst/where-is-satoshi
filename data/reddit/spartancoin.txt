nice drawing skills

Very elegant indeed. Although I see one (fairly unlikely ) scenario where you have 51% or more of total computing power over a very limit time. Such as a botnet. In this case I think it would be more profitable to try to screw around with the transactions in your favour than to start mining.

Like BTC-e. They send out confirmation emails you have to click before the transaction happens.

Bitcoin transactions itself are irreversible. Only way to avoid fraud is for the exchange to send verification emails, use 2FA etc.

Just want that guy to clear his throat.....

Wishful thinking ;)

Is 10 billion your critical mass? As a global trading protocol I think Bitcoin aims higher than 1/7 of Bill Gates net worth.

Do you realize the cap for Bitcoin is 21 million? Imagine there was only 21 million USD in the world. What could you buy for 1 USD then?

You seem to be absolutely clueless. Have you even done the math? You can't blame anyone believing that the value of Bitcoin could be in the hundred thousands. Let's say Bitcoin finally is as valuable as all the USD today. I approximate that in the world there's 10 trillion USD. Devide this with the total possible number of Bitcoins, 21 million. You get:
10,000,000,000,000/21,000,000 = 476,190 USD per Bitcoin.
Now, I'm not saying that Bitcoin will be this successful, but of course that is our ultimate goal. Bitcoin can be worth anywhere from 0 to 1,000,000 USD, so please. Don't be so ignorant.

The objective is to make secure transactions. Isn't that good enough?

I just lost faith in humanity...

When bitcoin is raising a lot (to the moon)

That is basically a web wallet, and thus you have to trust a 3rd party provider. The reason people want native wallets, is so that they don't have to rely on anyone. Same with cold storage. We already have many web wallets you can use on your iPhone etc. like this:

Yeah, because if you solved the great NP=P problem, Bitcoin would be the first to go down... Not all other security breaches way more important. Wake up from your dream!

Nice analogy
