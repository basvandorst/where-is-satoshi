Im Not defending btc in this instance. More so attacking people who think the banks are fool proof.

Yeah man. I'm not a financial expert, so I can't really say anything with certainty. I put a little in btc, but I think with the tax regulations and more to come from the government it may just remain stagnant. They know it could be a feasible way to stop banks, and that's a problem for them. Have to shut that down as fast as they can.

Sounds like bad legislation. Probably put into place by the same people making bank off of lobbyist.

Conspiracy side of me wonders about the massive inflation and then drop, and then regulations. Feel like a lot of people got richer off that!

Absolutely nothing unfortunately. I've tried to get something out of them, but they only seem to want my taxes!

Hahaha. So many cities have the shittiest infrastructure and terrible police forces. Pretty much everything the government does is trash, and the very minimum. Whilst they pocket money and spend more on defense. Come on bro. Government spending is atrocious. It's like they have an autistic 5th grader doing their budget.

If something major to were go down and a ton of people lost that insured amount, you think they're really all getting it back? Fat chance.

No one has an agenda. Just being honest. People are defending a broken system. How about the 7 trillion the pentagon "lost".
