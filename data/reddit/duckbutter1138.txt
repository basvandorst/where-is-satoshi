Robinhood. It looks cool and sleek but don't use it unless you just want to make money off of the price of crypto and not own any.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:47:12
Just wait to buy then.. Do whatever makes you happy, but if you get in the habit of selling things to invest, you're going to end up broke. :/
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:44:04
Why not both?
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:38:41
Why would you sell that? Just work some more hours and keep it for endless hours of fun.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:45:47
I thought everyone would be into crypto now! We’ve still got so much time to make money.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:47:31
That’s amazing! I used Tor browser and used Silk Road to buy weed seeds with btc to my mom’s house hahhh. What a time.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:04:26
Wrong comment sorry haha
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:51:00
I bought litecoin and ethereum when they were at 10 dollars. I think you'll make your money back :)
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:48:54
I can’t remember exactly, but it was around the my gox time. Bitcoin was $250 or so.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:03:24
Yep. I've cashed out along the way and I know crypto and blockchain is the future but look up the bitcoin cash vs bitcoin debate. It's hard to know what to do anymore.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:53:57
Yeah there are so many banks out there as well as online ones now days.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:43:41
Day trading=low risk? Haha! You're going to make millions and spend billions in taxes.
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:40:13
I need a support group for this. Your wife is understanding. No one wants to talk about this stuff!
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:18:41
I'm so nervous to go all in btc though because of what I've read in a certain bitcoin cash subreddit. I'm more confused than ever and I bought in at $250 bitcoin and ethereum and litecoin at $10 each.
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:18:21
But isn't there a fee to open and close a channel?
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:57:30
Yeah but it’s not too late! I figure, if it’s the future of money, then I’ll be able to buy food or at least break even when the economy slows for awhile.
@_date: 2019-07-29 02:44:06
Never use Robinhood
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:00:02
I don't know. I still don't know what to believe. I'm sick of evil, untrustworthy people.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:44:21
I wish. I bought a nice used car and paid off my debt. I keep getting impatient every time the price starts going up. I bought like 100 litecoin and ethereum when they were $10 a piece or something. I wish I just left it but we’re still in the early years so I’m DCA again!!!
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:21:46
There are a lot of crypto currencies though and no one knows for sure that bitcoin will be the one to prevail in the long run. So I wouldn't put all my money into one currency.
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:19:30
Coinbase Pro
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:02:19
They at least talk about real issues and not the price. Who the hell cares if btc price rises a couple hundred or thousands. There are so many amateurs here trying to get rich on a hundred dollar investment that they can't even afford.
@_date: 2019-07-16 03:49:26
This is the best day of my life.
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:58:07
Yeah!! True. I bought a car with btc and ltc and I made thousands from grubhub! :)
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:14:42
Wouldn't you rather use the dollar for regular purchases then? Since it's going down?? Cause if you want to use crypto as regular money, you would want the price to stabilize. And not use it as much on the way up.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:07:26
Why? Just buy the same amount every week and then you won't feel bad when it tanks for a couple months. You're not going to get rich quick. If you want to be in this for awhile, it doesn't matter how fast you get in. I bought in at $250 and my friend told me about it when it was at $14. You're either late or we're all still early! Just buy with money you're willing to lose. Nothing is a sure thing.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:52:12
Coinbase Pro and do limit orders.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:08:56
It's been two years and no one is using it!! And NO I don't want a Dunkin Donuts' / Starbucks Rewards fillable gift card like lightning network is.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:10:11
Cashapp is above market because they pass on the fees to you. If you want it right away, just use regular coinbase. It'll just cost a lot.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:39:42
I forgot what it was called! I’m going to log back in and see if I have anymore!
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:53:23
I get us wanting the price to go up, but you'll laugh when your friends and family can't afford to eat?
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:03:41
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:13:39
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:03:30
You can but have you guys compared the coin market cap price to cash app price? It was a few hundred off last time I looked.
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:59:38
I bought a 2003 Honda Accord with it and the air conditioning just went out in it. This is the most personalized meme I've ever seen. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:10:29
You can't do that with btc. It's decentralized.
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:01:39
That's good though! If you take care of the car, it'll last a long time and you can use it to make money.
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:42:13
How long did it take for you to write this?
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:48:13
But if you DCA then you'll always have the funds each week cause it's the same every week.? And btc fees are so high. It's more like gold then a useable currency.
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:29:38
Thanks mang!
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:20:27
If one lives below their means, they can gain financial independence.
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:38:55
Be careful with the stop losses and limits though because this is a crazy market and there's lots of times where it tanks just for a second because of whales. But congrats! I got in to btc when it was $250 and eth and ltc at $10.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:59:36
Says it's removed..thanks IRS
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:59:46
The roth ira would be good for a tax deferred approach and having crypto on a wallet or owning the keys is good in case you want to use it and if it is a future competing currency. If you DCA both are good.
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:56:29
I’ve been holding on and off since 2012. I’m bored.
@_date: 2019-11-23 02:54:54
You are the opposite of rich. And you will always be that way if you do these things throughout your life.
@_date: 2019-11-23 02:53:18
I did the opposite and bought silver with btc when it was up last time. I got into btc at $250 so this is all just fun
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:16:54
This just shows our political state. Opinions aside, there should have been a debate between Ron Paul and Obama. He's such a badass !
@_date: 2019-08-09 02:12:22
Now switch to coinbase pro limit orders and send them to a hardware wallet. Good job :)
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:43:04
We're competely reliant on credit. We're not just going to magically switch to crypto and there could and probably be lots of coins that come and go. Just invest what you're willing to lose and that's it. Even if it is the future, nothing is guaranteed. I've been buying btc since $250 but I'm still not confident hah.
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:42:15
I've been buying and researching crypto since 2012 and I don't know shit!
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:21:19
How much of that dollar was actual coin?? Haha
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:28:33
It's not
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:29:27
Yeah. It's not "accepting bitcoin". Sensationalism
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:36:16
There's already been like a million big pumps. Just stay in it longer.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:30:14
You're a hero.
@_date: 2019-08-10 01:19:52
Sorry, but I hope I never have to go to New Jersey again.
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:26:59
I saw 8 guys day trading using TA at a coffee shop and asked if they were trading crypto and they gave me their private trading website. It's definitely an MLM or affiliate marketing shit.
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:47:24
I don't get how most people here seem to have like a hundred dollars invested in it but constantly talk about hodling. Just don't worry about it!! Buy more, live off of it. Do whatever. I've been in this "scene" since 2013 and it seems like more of a cult than ever. If Bitcoin and possibly other cryptocurrencies are going to replace the dollar then why shouldn't you spend as well?
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:22:22
I'm so glad these comments are becoming more popular.
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:08:49
That all of us will be in jail for tax fraud with no Lambo.
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:45:33
No. I mean after you buy, transfer.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:32:37
I mean, I make a little over minimum wage and saved 8000 in 5 months. Why do you think everyone is so bad with money? I think people are getting smarter.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:14:46
As long as it took you to write that, you could have worked probably. With all of the jobs available in my immediate area, it's not that hard to make a little extra. Get two jobs for a few years to pay your shit off. Maybe people shouldn't have car payments and a 200 dollar cell phone bill. Idk.
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:27:37
Why not gdax? Coinbase is so expensive.
@_date: 2019-05-13 04:00:02
I've been halfway holding or whatever you guys call it since 2011 and have bought a car with the money but I can't stay out so I just take a little out every once in awhile.
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:14:49
I know this isn't a sub for other crypto and I don't know much but the return on some of the shitcoins was like 20,000% This is such a crazy time we live in.
