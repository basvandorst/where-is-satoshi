How long have you been running a node off a USB hard drive? Have there been any issues? I am planning on doing the same thing but have been cautioned against it by core developer Luke-JR. It seems pretty counterproductive to struggle so hard to keep block size low and then simultaneously discourage people from using the lowest cost nodes.

I've always run debian.

I suppose I will have to just try it and see how it does. I understand it is not ideal, but compromise is going to come with a sub 100$ setup. The chip at least supports SMART, SAT, and TRIM.

They claim the device was created specifically to relieve issues involving "poorly designed &amp; badly supported USB to SATA bridge chipsets". So I would assume they tested and selected a good one. Is the prevalence of crappy bridge chips what makes it a bad idea or is there something inherently wrong with converting SATA to USB?

But....but, Luke-JR says running a node that involves any use of USB is "a bad idea"

Can't you make a clone of this device where you actually possess the private key and can then double spend? In their FAQ the response to "How do I know I'm seeing a real Opendime" seems completely inadequate? Proving the device has the private key is useless if the person giving you the device also has the private key. I'm not seeing how this solves that fundamental problem.
