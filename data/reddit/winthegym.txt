as you'll hear, our model is to allow free transactions after a few bookings, that's nothing Airbnb is interested in, given their juicy 20% commissions
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:41:11
They accept both by default. On the desktop version there's a currency switch at the bottom left. In the mobile version the switch is at the bottom.

Haha, the 0.5BTC must be hosts who has not pegged it to fiat. The 11BTC could be an error by the host...can you send me the link?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:47:28
Thanks for this, I just switched the default, should be working fine now
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:58:48
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:32:20
sure thing, just create an account and send me your Airbnb listing and we'll set it up for you
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:54:17
Thanks! Would love to have you as a guest one day: in terms of inventory it obviously can't compete with Airbnb yet, but the hosts are all into crypto and you don't pay any fees after just a few transactions (at which point you can book through a smart contract)
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:25:21
I'm sorry if it's laggy on your machine, it's super fast on my machine, but i'll do some testing. We take Bitcoin and Ether at the moment
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:32:32
hahah, yes, Zurich and Zug have branded themselves as such...
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:32:16
i wrote silicon valley, because i also included meetups from palo alto and berkeley
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:42:00
wonderful, we have a few listings in ireland already but we need more!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:42:09
working on it! keep checking back
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:06:57
Yes, I've actually developed a map last week and will have that instead of the "most viewed" section in the next release
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:43:03
why would that be the case? most of our users actually import their Airbnb reviews and let their passports being verified
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:42:02
actually we as a platform explicitly don't want to hold people's credit card info to set ourselves apart from the traditional providers. But a way to accommodate your needs would be to either (i) request for a deposit or (ii) bilaterally ask guests for their cc number. Unlike Airbnb and VRBO don't censor messages, so you'd be free to ask them for this
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:08:47
cool, would love to have you as a host!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:41:40
please do!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:40:51
thanks! would love to have you as a host or guest
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:54:49
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:40:41
node.js, fb react, all the good stuff
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:17:54
i'm working on a map feature, but you can already search by country in the search bar
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:40:18
 We keep getting asked by experienced Airbnb hosts whether we offer the same $1m guest insurance as Airbnb, which we don't do at the moment. However, what people often don't realise is there are lots of cases where their insurance doesn't actually provide coverage and that Airbnb didn't offer such an insurance before they had already had 25 million bookings. To mediate this problem, we make sure to vet guests as much as we can, e.g. through passport verification and by providing their existing Airbnb reviews. Also, guests and hosts can freely communicate on our platform and if they distrust each other, they can even do a phone call or skype. But of course it would be better to offer a similar insurance as Airbnb does. We therefore aim to offer an optional crowdsourced smart contract insurance system at some point, but we haven't really worked out the technical details yet
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:33:32
i don't want to spam, but of course it's kind of hard to get people to care about any project these days thats not doing another ICO
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:41:19
awesome, we're looking for more hosts in NZ, especially Auckland
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:17:22
just pm me a link to your listing and I'll set it up for you
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:55:52
thanks, would have you as a guest or host
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:57:26
you can just set up an account and send me your airbnb listings, we'll set it all up for you
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:41:18
there's a currency switch on the bottom left
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:16:52
would be a good welcome gift by or for hosts
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:00:22
i think we agree more than we disagree, i certainly took your input seriously and i do think that the blockstack and unified id aspects you are discussing are really intriguing, would actually love to get more info on that
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:28:50
i'm a long-term bull, so would accept it any time atm
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:57:45
yes, the quoted prices will adjust day-to-day based on the USD/BTC exchange rate
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:33:51
Now I really feel sorry for the poor sob i sublet my apartment to in 2010 for 50 BTC a night :) In fact, it's what gave me the idea to build a "crypto Airbnb" in the first place. With BTC hitting 5k, now is definitely the right time to book your trip on my platform 
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:46:40
fees are half of Airbnb and then go all the way down to zero with every booking. The plan is to enable autonomous bookings between trusted nodes
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:51:18
i agree, it's all about trust. that's why - unlike Airbnb - there is no censorship on the private messages with the host on CryptoCribs. if you want you can even skype with them. there's no pancea for trust building, but it's a start
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:22:23
i still feel sorry for the poor sob i rented out my apartment in 2011 for 50 bitcoin a night
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:53:37
exactly, who needs pre-MVP million dollar ICOs 
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:20:55
it's not for everyone, but I would rather stay with trustworthy hosts and not pay 20% service fees
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:44:14
Perfect, would love to have you on board! PM me with your listing if you already host it somewhere, otherwise a few pics with your mobile would also do
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:47:50
i'd be more than surprised and happy if Airbnb opened up their data silo through an API and would allow people to contact hosts directly for booking outside the platform. At the moment they censor your messages when you try to exchange direct contact information. Just saying, we're still a long way from reaching market efficiency in that segment
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:52:48
good idea, thanks, thats an interesting subreddit
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:59:13
some of them have been paid in Bitcoin already
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:38:33
would love to have you as a host, just pm me of send us a mail to info
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:43:05
yes, you're right, we should add something more comprehensive, especially given that inventory is still limited
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:59:41
i love Airbnb and YC, and i would love to believe that they are believing in the power of the blockchain. But i think they are facing the innovator's dilemma with their insanely high service fees (up to 20%) it will be hard for them and their VCs to move into a zero transaction cost model, embracing decentralization and trustless exchange
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:10:03
interesting idea, but i think there are other search aggregators that do a better job at this
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:29:38
there is fiat conversion on the bottom left
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:40:21
actually hosts can fix it to either crypto or fiat, the 7600 is an error i think, i already sent the host a mail
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:40:36
amazing! great to have you
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:57:32
well, i obviously don't agree with your criticism, you clearly haven't read the whitepaper...it's less about crypto payment and more about building a reputation blockchain that allows for Airbnb stays without their insane fees. but the IoT solution you're proposing sounds interesting, slock.it did a great job on this already, especially with the DAO
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:05:23
it's not just about accepting crypto, Airbnb charges up to 20% service fees
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:08:44
In the meantime I have built the site and written a draft whitepaper. Check it out and let me know what you think:  Would be nice to have you on board!
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:57:52
nice plug man
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:06:10
cool, thanks for this, will check these out right now
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:30:44
thanks! yes, and the two places are really nice ones too
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:07:25
cool, just PM me your Airbnb listing and we'll prepare it for you
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:07:10
yes, we need more affordable ones!
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:32:53
many users would rather transact outside of the platform and curtailing this freedom is primarily done to protect the healthy service fees not to prevent data breaches. It's classic silo building because it protects the business model. Nothing wrong with that, they created the platform on which valuable user-generated content, i.e. reviews, were added. However, there's clearly room for a different economic model. And even though you may not like the term market efficiency, I'm sure many would agree that service fees up to 20% for simply connecting a host and a guest is not at a market clearing level
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:04:12
you gotta love your mum for accepting Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:05:24
it's not just about accepting crypto, Airbnb charges up to 20% service fees
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:07:50
just PM me your Airbnb listing and we'll prepare the listing for you
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:43:34
most host peg it to fiat
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:57:22
posted and subscribed
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:21:42
I agree, it would be easier to just use the existing data from Airbnb and the other social networks. But this data is being siloed as it's the actual value of these tech giants
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:31:30
btw if someone here is already hosting on Airbnb, just pm me the link and we can set up a listing on CryptoCribs for you
