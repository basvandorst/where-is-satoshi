I think it will drop then spike back even higher!

Sucks doesn’t it wish the hype would come back...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:42:16
Can’t believe it lol... wish I bought more when I got into this a few months ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:23:21
I can only hope...
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:21:57
Nice name I too am a JJ
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:20:35
I though coinbase supported the fork
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:59:03
I sure hope so!
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:27:06
So now what happens?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:58:49
Why such a huge drop?
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:25:28
No it happened today lol that’s why coinbase shut down for a few hours this morning. It stopped all buying, selling and transactions 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:28:36
True but the amount of people buying in will decrease as price continues to rise.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:02:53
Or a hardware wallet... like ledger nano s. Or keep it in coinbase... if it's small why not?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:56:15
I just try to catch the dips to get more for my small purchases... I don't have a lot of money to lose so I buy where I can and as much as I am willing to lose
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:24:10
Right... I am hoping that this is just the surface and people like you and I can enjoy continuous profits as it continues to grow.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:54:01
I had friends that had really tried to get me into it when it was like $600 and really really regret not listening to them. Obviously still a good time to be a part but could be in such a better position. Enjoying the excitement of it right now
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:57:28
While I really hope so, I just don't see it getting that high, the limitations of people who can buy at that level and the fact that if even gets close to that the worlds governments will certainly be involved. At least my perception 
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:43:54
I sure hope so I'd love to buy some more...
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:15:05
I use the coinbase app seems to work great and allows a widget so you can check prices all the time. Only down side is they only offer prices on ether, ltc, and btc 
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:52:38
Right! Crazy I wanted to buy at least $100 last night but got tired and passed out damnit!
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:04:27
I either want it to drop a lot so I can buy as much as I can, or sky rocket so what I have will be worth more this limbo 5400-6000 is brutal... hodl
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:35:40
Well I am a small investor and only investing what I can lose but I'd hate to buy if this fork drops the value but there are fairly decent perspectives from both sides. Buy in now and hodl or wait and hopefully have a chance at buying in a dip??? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:46:45
I hope so I want to invest more than .056 of coin that I have lol
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:01:10
Lol this guy... I hope so though 
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:12:32
Ok so where is  the best place to get a paper wallet or somewhere safe to store my coin. Sorry I am a newb on all this. Also note I don't like giving out too much info. What is the risk of keeping my bitcoin and litecoin in coinbase? It has been good for the last month I've had it.
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:41:35
The amount of smaller investors will. Note all the alt coins... So you really think a single coin will be over 100k? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:23:39
I know WTF! Does anyone know why??? I really should have invested more when it was in the 3s being new to this I had no idea... wish I could throw money at it now but feel like it will drop... 15-16% gains in one day...
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:39:23
Most people recommend nano ledger S but I too have my coin on coinbase I'm torn because I don't have a ton of coin and it's nice how coinbase works. I believe even though they support the fork it may be a good place to keep it as I am more probable to lose the nano s lol
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:54:54
I learned you have to be patient, I got in way too late to make the money some did but not to panic sell and not to panic buy is very important. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:55:51
I am leaving mine in there... gonna let it ride and find out the hard way I only have like $250 in btc and another $250 in ltc 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:33:55
Interesting fact, wonder of those how many own a lot?
