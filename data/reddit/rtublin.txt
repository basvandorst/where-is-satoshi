Whenever there is a post like "you can now pay with/use Bitcoin at...!" it's always through some random third party.

Yeah unfortunately I don't think this is going to take. I think we should not get excited until next Summer. The worst bear was something like 444 days, and I think this will be similar.

I think there is a lot of truth here. BTC is not going anywhere until nearly all of us have felt a great deal of despair, disgust, and, finally, boredom. It will start to be forgotten, you won't hear about it on the news, and you'll nearly forget you are holding any. Then one day...

I wonder if this is because stocks are doing poorly. It would be interesting if bitcoin started to move opposite to stocks.

This may be the last chance ever to get bitcoin below 10k this week.

If blockchain were used for voting, you would have a lot of problems with key management. It wouldn't be like Bitcoin where you could just create a new set of keys whenever you wanted one. The government would have to somehow issue keys, people would have to secure them themselves, and there would have to be procedures to reset your keys if you lost them. You can't do it in a really decentralized or trustless way because someone has to hand out the keys.

Not encrypted, but each vote would need to be cryptographically signed by the voter.

 is one with a lot of options. My only concern is that this has not been audited as well as other well-know ones.

This generator looks almost perfect, the only thing I would ask for is BIP38. I would not want to actually print a paper wallet without it, because my printer could be compromised in some way.
I hope you keep working on this.

In\-game microtransactions that are truly micro\-. Like sub\-cent prices for game items, or new pay\-to\-play models, like a game is free to install but it costs 5 cents in satoshis each time you start it up.

What about this for emails? Each time you send an email to someone you enclose some kind of smart contract that can be redeemed for BTC over lightning. At the top of your email client you have the option to refund the amount (which you do for friends or people you have a relationship with). When spammers do it, you don't press refund and you just keep the money. Spam is instantly solved. I think Bill Gates was talking about something like this in the early 2000s.

Yes it is humorous because it drops down to 0. I think that's a bug.

A new type of "gig economy" that is more like internet karma. For example, if stackexchange starts measuring karma in satoshis instead of internal points, and you can place bounties on questions, then you'll start to see people answering questions as a full\-time job, and the quality of answers will improve. (And the quality of questions will improve if you have to spend satoshis to post them.)

It has always been trivial to spoof the from address in an email, even without any sort of access into the target servers.
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:43:59
That is pretty elaborate and impressive.

Why not simply use a function or a sequence of factorials to represent your extremely large number?

If someone makes Bitcoin politically repulsive, people who are interested in it could become sufficiently harassed that the technology itself takes a hit. This is particularly straightforward in the US. You just have to sufficiently associate Bitcoin with things that are political issues. Say that it harms children, it's popular among Asians and Arabs, it hurts the environment, it's unpatriotic or connected to Libertarianism, it's used by anti-vaxxers or flat-earthers to promote their agendas, it's used by third-party election candidates and the vote-wasters who support them, it's used by religious cults. Even more destructive would be if you could somehow associate it with Conservatives or Liberals, then you instantly get a huge section of the population hating it and actively trying to legislate it out of existence. Some of these sound crazy but I would not at all be surprised if similar ideas appeared in the media within the next two years.

**ITT: many people misinterpreting the study. It's not even remotely about mathematically inevitable sequences that appear in sufficiently large datasets, so the "Pi" argument is kind of bizarre.**
**I think the best way out of this mess is probably to identify who placed the offending images. It's possible that they were deliberately placed there by the Russians or the Chinese (via miners) in order to undermine Western economies and technologies. Or at least the press might latch on to that story as much as they will the notion of illegal images being in the blockchain.**

I think this refers to how bitcoin gives you a good reaming when the price drops.

I think this is a good and necessary state. I think Bitcoin somehow feeds on apathy and boredom. In the past, it has only had huge runs after a long boring stretch, and these stretches are characterized not just by duration but by a situation where even the most enthusiastic people tend to stop checking the price, and a big drop in news coverage of Bitcoin.

This is pretty amazing, this is how hardware wallets should work.

Fuck no, it generates the same pair all the time, regardless of the supposed randomness it's taking in. And the private address doesn't even match the public. Looks like no one has fallen for it yet though

Why does this tell you about minority demographics like what 23.9% of bitcoin users make per year? It seems like it would be more accurate if it showed information about a typical bitcoin user or the majority of users.

You are right. I tried it with a computer program and it doesn't work.

When you bought in 2013 it felt a lot like it did today. You were thinking "Is this a bad idea? Am I throwing money away? Is this thing going to be around in 5 years?" I think a lot of people saw bitcoin as an inflation/collapse hedge than an investment back then, so they were hoping for stability rather than massive growth.
