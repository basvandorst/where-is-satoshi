@_date: 2018-05-29 23:32:24
Yeah bitcoin is psuedoanonomous, the govt could find which wallet was urs and ur transactions by linking ur IP address to ur connections to ur wallet servers n such. Monero mixes all this info up with other user and uses cryptography hence it being a crypto currency. It uses ring signature and mixing and the tech is made to make you anonmous.

Bro I'm so sorry, ur folio got raped today. Shitcoins are a total gamble, unless you are invited to the pump n dump telegrams or groups stay away from em they are ponzi schemes. Personally I can only recommend BTC, you cannot go wrong with BTC.

@_date: 2018-05-27 14:19:14
Do your research before u buy some shit coin. Bitcoin is the KING. Ethereum is okay as well. They all ride on bitcoins coat tails. This is FUD being spread by powerful people. Market manipulation is pretty bad right now. I could pay a blogger or something to say some cool shit about my coin. Neo is a Chinese copy, alot em have nothing really behind em. Alot of it is scams. Even if they don't think so themselves. U can't have 85,00 different currencies. Lols. I mean u could but a majority will  be worthless and seems almost all fuction like pump n dump penny stocks lol. Bitcoin is the only widely adopted cryptocurrency right now. A majority of these cryptocurrencies are ethereum erc20 tokens. I can make millions of tokens for cheap like I think a couple dollars, call it a name that isn't taken. Give it a abbrviation and list it on Binance. Google " create ethereum tokens", it will give u an easy to fill out template. And bam ur got ur own token. You must do ur research. The team behind it. It's marketing. White papers by some major crypto projects are plagerized. Bitcoin n ether are the ones I see with futures, just my opinion. Bitcoin for money, ether to participate on a decentralized internet. You can buy tokens whenever with ether, but if nobody wants ur shitcoin ur outta luck. Good fortunes brother. Again just opinion can be wrong.

@_date: 2018-05-24 19:22:57
Very good this will only be positive
@_date: 2018-06-05 12:52:03
Yeah even during that moment using mycelium I was able to still choose my transaction fee. To like 5 cents for a 95 dollar transaction to my trezor. I saw some as high fees as 10 and higher for me. Lol. It was my choice. It took like an hour to confirm once but I didn't care they were my wallets so I wasn't in a rush I had both wallets in hand. High transaction fees is kinda ur choice depending how fast u need a confirmation in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:24:36
I think they typically sell at or above market or all for a discount. Its ain't gonna go up on Gdax lol. They ain't gonna fuck up like last time were they lost out On a fuck ton of money. Lol, watch they will hodl n sell at a way later date when it's up. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:53:09
Unfortanatly some people can't be trusted with their own keys so a bank may be a good choice for them.

Nobody, I think coinbase uses fractional reserve. When you check their wallet addresses they give you. They don't come up in block explororer.
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:51:51
Its okay tp buy ur coins from there with a small fee, but do not keep the coins on there. As soon as u get em move em to a wallet. Of ur choice. It's only a matter of time before they get hacked. It's a cat n mouse game for the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:23:45
I will sell u coins for fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:21:38
Lols again its says no where they extracted private keys or hacked the fucking wallet, read it verbatim, you don't have to "hack" a wallet. Most likely these dealers were not into opsec and fucked up, no pin, entering pins/ keys on a computer. The dealers fucked up.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:03:35
Why do people still use a coinbase wallet for regular transaction, that's ur fault doggie. They have terms and service. You should have transferred to a different wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:08:11
Lol b cash
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:12:28
Yeah people who would've never day traded, saw an opportunity to get rich quick, started day trading cryptos, which we all know are probably some of the highest risk investments at the moment, and got fucked hard. Now there are a buncha extra coins and market needs to eat em up before the price goes up a lil bit.

People freaking out and selling, market is saturated. Also a future expires on June 29th. with lows going I think like $5975 per 1 BTC? And highs like $6030? It's being manipulated, in my opinion based off the articles I've been reading on here. Now is the time to buy, it might go a little bit lower by the end of the.month but I doubt it. It will end june I think in the the range of 5975-6030 per btc, then go up like 700 and come back down to meet the next expiration for July. Best thing right now is buy low sell high. Use futures as a basis for when to buy.
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:40:59
It's all relative.
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:10:36

So I just tried to play at a bitcoin casino for the first time yesterday. I went to bitcoincasino.us, deposited u0 dollars over the course of the day, and I needed up with like 110 mBTC so , I go to cash out and it won't let me lol. They got me, I'm. A dumbass, lesson learned. 
EDIT: This is not a scam, i am sorry, You need to verify your withdrawal in your email that you set up for them to push it out, make sure you take of your bonuses before you start playing, or else you have to spend the wager amount to pull out your winnings, just forfeit your bonuses when you deposit first time and turn them off. i got my money back. THIS PLACE IS LEGIT!! HELL YEAH!!!
EDIT 2: please deposit with caution though, i spent all night last night thinking i got scammed out of 70 BTC. Who knows how much its worth years from now.

Yeah seriously, i hate Ver so much, Like you know he had to come to the conclusion that he was going to try and scam people and to not break character, Ver probably has little to no moral compass, It takes a real piece of shit to just keep pushing BS and knowing your wrong but still doing cuz hes getting paid. Bcash was a scam pushed hard by chinese miners so transaction fees would stay high, not because they believed it. CHinese miners are for just for profit they don't care if bitcoin goes to zero, they tried to make it worthless by forking it a bunch fucking times. Im sure Ver is probably a millionaire no doubt. lols but trust me he aint got Bcash, He knows better. Personally i buy Bcash and litecoin for purchasing other alts so as to keep those transactions of the bitcoin block chain. Bcash is just wash money for the time being til its worth nothing, Bit coin will continue to evolve the cryptography will only get more advanced, Bitcoin will evolve to and for sure incorporate quantum cryptography. There are already Hashes that are Quantum secure, lol. Its going to be a currency that excepted worldwide, and will work along side other currencies. But it will be seen as gold if not better because hard to counterfeit and easy to verify, hard to acquire (mining). etc
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:18:57
Lols its doesn't say shit about them opening a hardware wallet. Just that they got the funds from it. If they didn't have a pin on their wallet or had been compromised because of shitty opsec , that just that, not because they cracked a wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:09:33
Just hold it man, you gonna have to wait a while. Now I think your best hope is world wide adoption over time as has been happening. It might be years though.

.1 BTC is 100 million sataoshi, if its gets to 1 penny per sat., .1 will make you a millionaire, currently .1 is about like $850 US I think. So yeah about 5 years .1 will probably be over 100 thousand US $ I think.

-Bisq is a decentralized exchange I've only used it once to sell, but the payment options they give you are awesome, you can buy other cryptos on there too.
-Coinbase is cool too, if you learn how to you coinbase pro/gdax you can pay no fees of u txfr cash to your acct.
-get a hardware wallet/vault I use Trezor. Use a pin as well.
-if you don't have the seed/private key to the wallet the funds in that wallet are not yours they are in someone else's possession.
@_date: 2018-07-17 08:28:32

This, when someone just makes this statement. About the Fed, I immediately think they are a trump supporting conspiracy theorist. The fed control monetary policy, you know how much money they destroy? Do you know what quantitative easing is, and the opposite. It is not in the best interest of the rich to hyperinflate their own currency, since it would cuase chaos and USD would be worthless. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 19:24:16
Yes sir.
