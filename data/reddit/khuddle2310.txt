Or acceptance of another blockchain. She definitely mentioned Bitcoin because it's a blockchain everyone knows. I know I'm going to get downvoted for saying this, but during the ethereum enterprise alliance one of the J.P. Morgan chase representatives said "were a bank, we have no interest in bitcoin" 
I own Bitcoin and ethereum. I'm optimistic about both futures because both need to succeed. Until we see a Bitcoin bubble, then I'll sell. Just my 2 cents.

Are you sure about that? Ethereum is a separate blockchain based off the idea of bitcoin but is far more advanced. Also, with the announcement of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance announcement, I think the hash rate for ether is going to skyrocket once big tech companies merge their private blockchain over to the public blockchain. Ethereum has alot going for it, look into Raiden MVP too. Either way, both are incredible high risk/reward investments. However, if you believe in it enough jump on board and ride the roller coaster.

I THINK we're about to stabilize soon around the 840 mark, could take another small tumble. After that we could see some big gains after all the attention Bitcoin got. 
I am only (wishfully) speculating so take everyone's word on this subreddit with a grain of salt.

Right was waiting for it to stabilize a little more before declaring open season on discounted coin.

Ahahah this is perfect. I can confirm stage one. I've checked the price about 20 times today. I do think that bitcoin is the future, I'm just irritated as to how soon we will adopt the concept.

But the cashier could start thinking about buying Bitcoin if they hear it so many times a day.

LOOOOOL Were seeing a Christmas dump right now. Hodl though, I still think we'll break the 1,000 barrier in January so keep buying.

I made an account with them but I have to use a utility bill to confirm my identity and my roommate pays the utils. Do they trade in usd?

Eaaassyyy.. Why do you say that? No one has a crystal ball. No one knows for sure if it's going to raise to 1,200. I think he's a little skeptical after that correction we saw today. Anything could happen.
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:17:20
No I'm saying if we go grocery shopping or to Walmart or best buy and ask if they accept Bitcoin every time we ring out that could be huge.
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:38:32
Most people don't give a shit about it right now. That's very true. I'm hoping people catch on once they see how easy it is to use. It's a better currency but they're scared away by it because "cryptocurrency" oh no cyber stuff.

How often do you see ads on this sub? I got a recommendation for a nano s and wasn't sure if it was an ad
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:53:02
No idea.. I verified the account and maxed out the amount I could get. Wasn't expecting it to take 10 days. Really pissed because I bought in at 904 and haven't seen much growth. I'm in for the long haul though.

@_date: 2016-12-31 06:47:59
It's just too complicated to boil it down to those two things. My issue as a consumer/investor is, other than making money like a stock, what is the current purpose of bitcoin? Sure you can use it on a few random retailers but it's mostly like gold at this point. Gold would skyrocket in value too if we decided to use it as currency again, but it's just an investors tool.

Nigeria buys quite a bit of Bitcoin so this should be good news

I just invested for the first time using coinbase.. It's going to take 10 days for it to go through and my fee was pretty high. I would also like to hear some good recommendations.

People in this sub who keep saying "To the moon" ha. The only way I see bitcoin exploding is if major currencies deflate. I know India was part of that movement, and china is starting to buy in. How much time do you think bitcoin will take to reach the 1,200 mark? Do you think it will dip below 900 in the next year? obviously speculation, but it's nice to speak with someone who isn't claiming it's gonna explode.
@_date: 2016-12-24 02:56:54
So I bought in at 900 and don't need the money I put in right now. What factors could cause the value to drop below 800? I have confidence in bitcoin, just wishing I had bought when it was below 800.
@_date: 2016-12-24 12:37:14
Look at the current trends.. It's staggering in growth. I could see a massive sell off coming.
