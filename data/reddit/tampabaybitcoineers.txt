Way better then SWC
@_date: 2015-06-26 02:37:16
Yes. Check my guide out. (Work in progress) 
I highly recommend getting the [Airbitz]( Bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:59:42
I recommend going downtown.  Ferg's, Ricky P's, Green Bench Brewery, Genero's Coffee... lot's of businesses are happy to accept bitcoin.  I know because we've held meetups at all those places ;)

I don't have any issues browsing a location without selecting a category. You simply leave it blank. Search the city, state/province, or country only.
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:21:43
Looks like a great product!  Totally needed, I've got too many wallets to keep track of.  This will be great for businesses and organizations too. Great job Tapeke team!
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:40:31
I think this is a great service. Very easy to use. I'm going to recommend Trucoin to newbies.
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:30:23
Great presentation Paul!  
As a side note, I want to congratulate you and Airbitz for being the official wallet/directory of the Bitcoin Bowl. Your wallet has a ton of useful practical features that make using bitcoin fun and easy while keeping the private keys highly secure.

In regards to the 1Lucas address, as ChainSmokerJoe said, it was the address the campaign used before they setup the page with Bitpay.  I was unaware of that so I just put up the address that I knew.  I removed the address.  Please make all donations through his website.  Sorry for any confusion.
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:33:53
YES!  Mixing Tenacious D with Bitcoin is brilliant!
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:23:33
You've never heard of him cause he can't pay for ads.  lol  That's why he needs support!
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:54:24
Good deal!  If you live in the Tampa Bay area, please find our meetup group Tampa Bay Bitcoineers.  We want to continue the momentum from the Bitcoin Bowl by bringing bitcoin accepting business some bitcoin action.
 
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:25:14
We'll be there in force.  Very excited!
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:24:25
Tampa Bay Bitcoineers supports this event!  
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:22:50
Hope he comes to my meetup!

twoyearbitcoin.info would make you feel better.

Airbitz = the Uber of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:08:48
Wow. Trolls are hitting you hard just for mentioning Airbitz? They're a completely viable option. Looks like somebodies scared of the competition.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:22:31
Def recommend Airbitz. Plenty of security, especially with their one-touch 2FA built-in. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:53:57
Buy/Sell from exchanges? Or a local trader deal like Mycellium?
Either way, looking forward to it.
@_date: 2014-05-14 04:09:24
I want this as a poster.
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:17:03
This is great! We're going to make a video at the next meetup.

In this situation, isn't Breadwallet one of the least secure wallets?
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:01:01
Could be due to the recent fork problems of SPV nodes misbehaving since Breadwallet is an SPV wallet. Your funds should be ok, but its advised to wait 30 confirmations.
@_date: 2015-07-06 04:19:29
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:25:59
Right, but if they have to wait for 30+ confirmations they won't know they've been defrauded for another several hours no?
This defeats the supposed benefit of using SPV in the first place.

Airbitz hasn't gotten the same publicity as some other wallets with far lesser qualities and features. However, this doesn't make the wallet less credible. There are a number of reviews about their security architecture and ease of use. Not to mention, Airbitz was the official wallet for the Bitcoin Bowl. ;)
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:54:26
Confirmations refers to when a transaction is mined into a 'block' on the blockchain (this occurs approx every 10mins). With each subsequent block found, each transaction is reconfirmed and buried deeper into the chain. This gives more confidence that the transaction is valid.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:36:58
Airbitz is zero-trust, zero-knowledge. Everything is encrypted client-side before sent from the device. Username and Password is how it's decrypted on the device. The permissions are because they use lots of features from your device (ie. sending a payment request via text to a contact on your phone), but none of these features grant external access or compromise security in any way.
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:20:47
^ Fact.
Highly recommend it to people and businesses alike.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:49:52
There are numerous ones throughout the world every year. 
Not sure the demand is there for a "NAMM" kind of convention for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-19 16:16:08
Nicely done Airbitz! This is great, especially for the average person. Makes securing your wallet much easier. THANK YOU!
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:57:54
Just in time for moon launch. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:33:30
For Airbitz it doesn't really matter because all your data is automatically encrypted on the device itself so they never have access to it at any point.
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:58:10
Best wallet out!
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:50:07
From my understanding Airbitz does online backups, but all data is encrypted before sent to any of their servers.  As far as validation, all transactions happen directly to libitcoin nodes, transactions don't go through Airbitz for validation. This is why even if Airbitz goes down or goes away, none of your funds are lost and you can still make transactions.

Official Bitcoin Wallet/Directory of the Bitcoin Bowl. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:18:41
I agree. All of those options are poor in terms of security.
If you want to be in control of your btc, I would def add Airbitz to that list. It's user friendly, they don't have access to your keys and highly secure. Automatically backs up your wallet (encrypted client-side before going to their servers), and you can access the same account with multiple devices whether iOS or Android. They've structured their platform in such a way that you have full autonomy, but can utilize their automated backup, so you get all the benefits of a decentralized solution, but with an option to regain access to your funds if your device was ever stolen or broken or lost.
They also use a much stronger encryption alg and r-value gen then Blockchain.info... which has had problems with that.
@_date: 2015-02-06 03:51:45
Are you able to see the same balance on both devices?  It sounds like the master passphrase is generating slave public keys because it's an HD wallet.
Airbitz automatically has multi-device capability that also works cross-platform (iOS &amp; Android). Might be another option.
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:42:03
Yeah, I find Airbitz to more user friendly. Plus I don't have to write down 12 words somewhere... Airbitz is simple and highly secure, everything encrypted client-side and backed up automatically. 
It's the only wallet out that is easy enough and secure enough to trust my mom to use it.
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:55:04
Exactly. I stopped using blockchain.info wallet because of their security breach problems and they have not implemented HD wallet functionality. There's no excuses for that kind of incompetence in the most prolific and most funded wallet in the space.
Airbitz is doing a far better job with far less resources IMO.
