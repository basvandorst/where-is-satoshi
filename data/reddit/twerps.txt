That's what kills me. I bought in hoping to see block chain take off in use and not just as a fad investment that isn't utilized at all for any of it's possible uses.

Unnatural intuition, insider knowledge, luck, spying on other investors or quantitative analysis. Gotta get by somehow since time travel doesn't exist.

Being a holder or borrowing irresponsibility are the only real options.

Wait a minute. Is that why I see "lead, the other precious metal" bumper stickers?  Is the idea that if the economy tanks and social unrest occurs, that bullets will have been a better barter investment than gold and whatnot?    
   
That's not a diss/challenge. I'm genuinely curious if this is a thing that I had not yet caught onto.    
   
If so, that is clever and kind of morbid too. Who knows if it's actually sound though. I hope never to find out.

I agree. The majority of blogs aren't any more of a big deal than a forum username.   
   
If you're posting everyday and able to bring in a few hundred thousand hits, then why not try to make money on doing something people want?

If he was planing on buying them, would you expect him to talk them up or down?

Google analytics at least just measures where people go.    
    
Facebook's ghost profiles figure out who you are even if you never go to Facebook.com. they use your friends' contact lists to "fill in the gaps" when there is a person that doesn't join. That, coupled with the tracking they do with the phone app, the "like" buttons on every page that track people at every visit, and the fact that they know your online habits  WAY better than anybody else does, makes them far creepier than any other service out there.   
    
They're both data mining, but Facebook k iws who you are, who you talk to,  sees just about everywhere you go, and has a name, face and all your other personal information connected to it. Google wishes they had that much info on everybody.

That's because banks would prefer that you use the option with higher merchant fees.   
   
You are being rewarded for increasing the costs of running a business.

Fewer than 20 since this amount is approximately 6% of all of btc currency.

If large groups of people always made good decisions and took care of community issues, there would be no need for janitors, police, and especially forum moderators.

I would gladly pay something like $20 per month for a service that pays people to not show me ads.    
   
It seems pretty broken to me that the options for non-commercial sites seem to be:  
A) Annoy users    
B) Go broke   
C) Beg for donations (see option B)   
   
In a perfect world, Adblock would be a paid service that gives content creators something for their work. I just don't know how that would work without shady websites gaming the system and creating fake views.

I thought the wireless charging would be gimmicky.   
   
Now I have three wireless chargers and am contemplating getting another to mod into my car's stereo pocket.

You have a Facebook profile  even if you don't own a computer.   
    
    
Like I said, google can't even dream of that level of invasion.

 way more interior room, and absolutely zero transmission shift delay or engine rev limiting.      
   
I would love to drive one of these. I hear that when you hit the gas, there is no delay whatsoever. Torque is on the wheels as soon as your foot moves.    
   
I'd love to see an AWD version.

Blockchain voting looks to be very promising.   
It is anonymous and verifiable. Everybody can see that their vote was counted, but you can't use the ledger to work backwards and figure out somebodies vote.

I bought a SkyRC charger that is extremely prone to being faked. Their solution is a scratch off sticker with a code and instructions to go to their website for verification. When you run a check, it shows you how many times that code has been verified.

Nice. Though with that much on the line, I'd split it up logically and physically. Eggs and baskets...

I think blockchain is awesome technology and bitcoin is proof of it's power. I'm slowly getting up to one coin, but it's not been easy this last month.  (changing jobs with my first kid on the way)

Another perspective - 21 btc means no more than million people in the world can ever have more Bitcoin than you. Automatic 1.4x10^(-10)% club.

You can read out the factory firmware and compare the checksums against your own compiled version.   
   
If you don't trust the compiler, you can compile it from source. If you don't trust the compiler compiler, you can write one in assembly. If you don't trust the assembler, It's probably best to just go and join the Amish or something.

Super paranoia mode: Buy a 4gb SD card, use in a raspberry Pi, do your thing. Then remove SD card and snap it in half.   
   
That would cost about $7 if you really scrounge. I would be happy just to perform a full reformat.

So, just a super expert hodler?

I'm all for removing franchise protections.    
That is a local problem. The FCC has nothing to do with that.     
I'll agree all day that franchise laws are outdated and anti-competitive.   
NN was put in place to prevent ISPs using their size to gain an unfair advantage towards competitors and customers. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:11:54
Without NN, ISPs have the right to filter or throttle any content for any reason.    
Banks could pay to have blockchain traffic throttled or blocked outright.

It's happened multiple times in the US and is worse in other countries.  
   
     
    
    
If you don't believe any of that, look at who stands to benefit from repealing net nuetrality. It's not small business, it's not the consumer. It's just bug business fucking people over and creating a sad/scary mix of Monopoly and Orwellian control. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:10:53
End the FCC?    
Not sure if trolling or just plain dumb.    
Without the FCC we'd be having this discussion via carrier pigeon because all communications would be an absolute clusterfuck of chaos as it was back in the early 1900s before the FCC set standards and allotments.    
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:09:06
Absolutely correct. The Bell system broke apart on its own the government was trying to keep it all together to protect fair fees and discourage competition. Same with the rail industry in the 1900s.   
   
/s seems very necessary today.

Net Neutrality is not the same thing at all as local franchising restrictions.    
   
Net neutrality is what keeps Comcast from charging extra fees for "competing" services like Netflix.    
   
I'll agree that it's bullshit that cable and phone providers can simply prevent unwanted competition. Giving ISPs more control is not the solution!

I'm not nearly as worried about social media as I am about student loan debt.

It's more of a question of "Is this a good idea?" than "Will it work".   
   
I like the idea of reducing debt, but it needs to be done responsibly and not "Nuke it from orbit".

Printing and moving that much cash won't be cheap. The smart move is creating much larger denominations.  
Trump should have his face put on the $50 million bill so I can be reminded of his genius every time I buy a loaf of bread.

The thing that worries me about large companies accepting bitcoin is that they probably convert it to fiat money ASAP. I'm no economist but I can only imagine that that devalues BTC in the long term, and in a way that's difficult to recover.    
   
Ideally they would be spending instead of converting it.

A lot of people are uncomfortable with the lack of a central authority. That won't change overnight.
