Well, I think things are improving. I use exodus wallet for some smaller amounts. Heads up, parts of their code are not open sourced. But I've used it for years and no problems so far. Customer support is also out of this world.

No one is hating on banks here. 
In my country you kinda do have to use them. In order to receive paycheck from your employeer you need to have a bank account. 
But I agree that most of the banks are just providing banking services. And people working in banks are not evil, they are just regular people that are stuck within the current system.
Banks are one of the most regulated businesses. And they are regularly audited whether internaly or externaly. Yeah, controls sometimes fail just like in any other business.
Bottom line is that people are hating on banks cause they have a monoploy on money transfer and loan granting. But this is mainly fault of the debt based system and not the banks themselves although they are closely correlated.

Fake and gay. 
Anyone who supposedly has 150 BTC wouldn't ask these kind of questions on reddit and admit that he has 150 BTC. Even if you sold them it would mean that you have at least a million $. Doubt a person in your situation would be looking for advise on reddit regarding your friend's feelings. 
I also have a friend who gave me a gazillion of gold bars. Meanwhile he moved to Mars and is now asking his gold back as all his gold was confiscated by aliens. Tragic story indeed. So should I ship him half of my stack via teleport or should I just use Solar FedEx?
Advice needed...

Bitcoin to bla bla bla Shmores article. 
Another useless prediction. Would love to know what they said while bitcoin was at 3.2k
It will go up and down and up and down etc. Long term it will go up and pretty much everyone knows it

I would say one of two things will happen. The price will either go up or down. I would bet everything I have that one of those two things will happen.

1. Laziness and convinience - most of the population are not ready or willing to be responsible for their own money i.e. keeping their private keys safe by themselves. They would rather use banks. Maybe some custodians that appear in the future will help but that is not the point of crypto
2. Taxes - fiat to btc, btc to alts and vice versa. Plus I think taxes on crypto will be very high to discourage the use
3. Market manipulation/scamming - still a large percentage of cryptos are being heavily manipulated. And people getting scammed on a daily basis
4. Emotions of retail investors in a volatile market -  people screaming sell/hold/buy everytime BTC's price changes by more then 3%. Most of the posts here look like a festival of madness. 
I would say nr. 2,3,4 could be solved when market matures. So nr. 1 is the biggest problem for me but as I said custodians are already emerging. Still using custodians really doesn't change the system that much. BYOB

The spoofer places large fake buy or sell walls in order to deceive other market participants in to thinking that there is demand or excess of supply. 
Lets say spoofer places a large buy order slightly below best bid price. Other traders see this huge buy order and presume there is a huge demand which might raise the price so they buy and raise the price themselves. In case his fake buy wall doesn't deceive anyone and the price starts going down he will cancel his order and place it again just below best bid. So he is not really looking into buying more. He already has a long position and he wants to sell at higher prices. Once he sells, the price will most likely fall down again.
You can do similar with fake sell walls in order the supress the price and buy cheaper

It's not the order duration that is the problem here. It's the intention of executing the order that is relevant. One can spoof the market even if his order is tradepending for hours.
So rules are already laid down, placing an order without the intention of executing it all so you can move the price is considered market manipulation

And yet majority of people are not responsible and doubt they will ever be. It's like saying why would you insure your car, house or anything else. Just be responsible. Not how the world works.

Imagine you have 1 mill in btc and you lose your private key. Or sending by mistake 1 mill instead of 1$
Most people don't have over 250k so for them  there is no upside in having BTC in terms of safety or not getting their money back.
There are other more important advantages that will get people interesed in BTC...

Could you elaborate what those little white dots mean - S2F Multiple?
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:44:20
Yeah, and crypto today is so easy and convenient. 
First you have to buy crypto with fiat and you will pay some kind of a premium or a fee. Then you send it and you pay a fee. Then the person on a receiving end has to sell it and pay fees and voila they get your money. And in the meantime they are risking a huge drop in value cause it is volatile.

Maybe a stupid question but wouldn't the outcome be the same if you rebuy the same crytpo/stock. 
Let's say I invest in Tesla 1000$. Tesla drops and my holdings are now worth 700$. Now I sell before the year ends and rebuy it again at 700$. My capital loss is 300$. 
Next year Tesla surges and my holdings are worth 1500$. And before the year ends I sell it again. Now my capital gains are 800$. If I held Tesla all I this time my capital gains would be 500$. Isn't then the ammount of tax payed in bot situations the same?
Futhermore, in many countries capital gain tax doesn't apply if hold at least two years. Wouldn't it be wiser to hold for two years instead of selling and buying every year?

When the bank returns the loan, money is not in circulation anymore. In fact there is less money circulating as the bank has to pay interest on that loan. 
Usually it repo is done between banks. Some banks have less then they need so they borrow while others have more so they give loans. 
What happened here was that the banks were not willing to give loans cheaply so the FED had to step in. 
Only question remains is why they were not willing to give those loans? Sounds like there are trust issues related to loan repayment which is worriesome because it came out of nowhere

BTC is currently menstruating. Historically, BTC's menstruation periods tend to last even couple of years.

Again, without the bet he would have 270k instead of 220k. 
Plus the first btc he already owns which is not in your example.
The downside would be worse as without the bet he would have to pay back the loan himself.

What difference does it make if it is 8k or 50k? It still does the same thing it has been doing for the last 10 years. 
If it could go from 0 to 20k it sure can go to 50k and beyond for the same reasons it has been going up from start. Someone else already explained what those reasons are...

Those are overnight repos so the currency supply is not actually increasing. In fact banks need to pay back principal plus interest.
It raises some other issues but not the ones everyone else is implying.
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:22:47
Fed prints money which is returned day later. Money does not stay in the economy.
