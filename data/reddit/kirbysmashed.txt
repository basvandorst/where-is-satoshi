Some silly questions:
What coins can you buy?
What are the fees?
can australians use it?
does it need photo verification?

Bitcoin will likely solve the transaction fees and recover. selling would be bad idea compared to holding I think.

I give it a year max. there's multiple developments on the front page involving it and it's top priority.

Hold. aka don't sell. aka might as well hold instead of selling at a loss in case it takes off in future.

personal responsibility to report and stomp out intentionally misleading entities.


Probably won't happen unless the coin is intentionally misleading.
