I read black swan and don't like it.  Guy is full of himself. No insights to justify the book.  It is obvious stuff.

Dear God BTC users now love welfare what is going on.  Wasted five million

Lie. This is not just "what happens" in "any country".  American founders would be embarrassed to see the level of control we live under now.  And no, George Washington wasn't paying capital gains tax stuff on his investments, it kind of defeats the purpose for why they fought a war

I doubt it. The establishment hates Elon.  They will hurt him

This is partly true.  Russia is also a backer of the anc.  Russia trains the South African secret police who support the anti white farmers in the first place.  Classic Kremlin provocation

Jesus when did this Reddit sub get to be so cluesless about the theory underpinning btc

He was right.  He wasn't just talking about black people.  We are all slaves to Washington DC today.  And that's a choice

Holy crap.  Someone insults bannon.  They bring politics into Reddit.  I merely say I like him
I get 21 downvotes and get called hateful.
Think about that

No way.  French govt says transactions in cash above $2 are illegal. They're looking out for citizens ya know
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:08:00
I like BTC.  And I like trump.  And I like bannon.  
I don't think he is "just plain fucking crazy"
@_date: 2018-06-16 06:00:53
I'm surprised by how much hate Trump gets on this Reddit.
His budget director mulvaney loves BTC.
Trump wants less regulations.
Regulations on BTC would be more likely under Dems.

I think there are a few big buyers.  Then randoms see the rise, get excited, and sign up on coinbase

BTC won't raise as a 1to1 function as adoption raises imo.  More like the cost of bread as loaves run out

1) I don't trust the authors
2) I don't trust our govt
3) our govt has way too much power
4) our govt abuses its power

Iran is ruled by terror regime.  Give that money to Iranian people not the tyrants.  America is right.  Germany is wrong.

Good post.  On this exact topic I highly recommend the book Red Cocaine

I learned today that was fake news
  The court never tried him for that alleged offense.  It was just used to smear him
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:40:21
Lol Germany.  Whatever you say

It doesnt matter if Ross hired a hitman not cause he wasn't even tried for that crime.  In America we are supposed to have trial by jury 
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:09:58
Except govt never tried him for that alleged crime.  If people want to jail him for that...okay...convict him w a jury
