Hodling sounds easy on paper, until for the majority 2018 hits you. Everyone still hodling are feeling numbed now I guess. I mean, we won't care about this period once BTC hits 50K, 100K or whatever, but the feeling now just sucks, whatever the price in the future may be. Now to shill my service because it's genuinely useful for hodlers like us, give [coinbakers.com]( a try if you want to feel more confident about hodling.
I have a portion in alts and the rest my own service basically manage everything. For the people downvoting any crypto service to oblivion and calling it a scam, check out the [about]( page. I'm a serial entrepreneur and made this service for myself because I felt the hodling pain too.
I think if a stock market crash happens, it will drag crypto with it, but crypto will climb out of it much sooner and get attention from stock investors at that moment.

So he will always lose out from a bot or managed fund while going out for a day or sleeping.

I dont trade lower timeframes and my strategy is pretty slow so thats why its not peforming very well atm.
There are some pretty easy patterns to spot in this sideways market but not sure how long that will hold.
Agree with slippage possibly being an issue. My frequency is pretty slow usually 1-2 trades a month, sometimes none. This would affect a high frequency algo more than mine though. I use a combination of market and limit orders to prevent chasing the price all the way up or down. 
But since it’s pretty slow the few $ difference doesnt matter that much in my case.
Also the in backtests I include some slippage and fees, but most of the time its using limit orders so this should offset some.
Thanks for your thoughts.

Agree with that it can be stressful. I cant do it if it was not automated. I practically never touch a buy or sell button.
Theres not so much ego or status for running a micro fund though ��

My actual results are pretty similar as the backtest results so never thought of running a live paper trading bot next to it for verification. Good suggestion. Thanks!
