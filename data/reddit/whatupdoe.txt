What I worry about is that bitcoin futures are essentially speculative vehicles designed for investors to take advantage of a hot new asset class. These futures contracts are going to exclusively settle in fiat which should tell you all you need to know. The people that are creating these future markets and investing in them are not committed to what should be the long-term goal of bitcoin, that is to create a payment system independent of the financial and governmental systems that have failed time and again. 
On the other hand, that is not to say that futures markets could certainly decrease price volatility, but I find that highly unlikely as we have seen throughout the history of BTC that it is very difficult to pinpoint reasons as to why the price falls or rises so dramatically.

Not OP, but thanks for writing this. This is the clearest explanation of why block size should be limited that I've read.

Yeah I thought we put this clown to bed like a year and a half ago. Was surprised to even see this headline.

He was asked to talk about it by the moderator, Pindar Wong of VeriFi. While it wasn't an audience question it's not like he went off completely unsolicited.

After the Q and A session ended the audience began to clap. Pindar interrupted the applause and told Gavin to talk about Satoshi. The transcript probably doesn't capture this because Pindar asked the question over the noise of the clapping.
