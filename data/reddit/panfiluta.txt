bitcoin in its current state is more like a deflated potato
if you think it's closer to "digital gold", im done :D

in a serious and non-hostile way, can you explain to me how is it connected in this case? my major is economics, so you can skip the definition of elasticity... maybe I really overlooked something, so I'm happy to learn
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:56:12
nice argumentation
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:32:29
Hole: There is no demand for that high a price.
What happens if someone buys all the potatoes in the world and then a potato costs 1000 USD? Well no one's gonna eat french fries for a while, that's what...

I mean I'm not a pro economist nor an investor. I majored in it, but still I don't think my opinion is very educated. I think it will crash and people will start buying it massively due to the low price &amp; since everyone will know it's "just a recession". So they will expect it to gain value once the economy starts booming. Could also happen that the price won't drop that much and people will see the value over traditional money.

I'm not saying it's not possible, but in general, it's how it is. You might be one talented individual, but take 100 other people who know nothing about economics/finance and start giving out their wildest predictions based on a coffee stain.

What is a "very large minority"? :D Is it much smaller than a very small majority?
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:48:20
It's like that in many fields, the more experienced you become, the more tunnel vision you suffer. That's why many breakthroughs are done by young scientists.
In economics I think it's especially bad, since it's not a traditional science, a lot of it is based on doctrine (sometimes it feels more like religion lol)
I agree about Krugman, he is a one trick pony that became famous
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:07:45
Agreed. I always try to distance myself and look from "outside of the box". A large part of (mostly macro) economics is very much like a religion, unfortunately. But I'm glad I got a training in for example how the financial market works.
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:25:29
It's always playing with probability. No one can say with certainty. Some people just happened to be lucky.
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:53:39
I guess their comments get drowned in the vocal majority that gets emotional with every change and then group mentality / hivemind takes over. Quite sad, there might be some very valuable information and observations buried underneath.

Well, no one could have predicted BTC to be this sucessful, all was pointing towards the opposite. That's just how you predict something, you cannot predict the unpredictable. Usually, the forecasts are wrong :P Wish I had a crystal ball...
That's also why BTC is so fascinating for me, it's so dynamic that it makes no sense.

I don't know the vast majority, but I read about a couple of famous people from Wall Street and they are highly educated, sometimes from the Ivy League.
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:02:36
Tbh I'm not a big fan of Krugman and I think the economics "Nobel's prizes" (they're not really) are mostly a political tool

I don't know why you speak for the whole America, not everyone is such a simple-minded redneck as you. There are many Americans who live in Europe and love it here.
Maybe you're just bitter that you couldn't get a work visa, don't worry, if you keep trying you might get a chance :P
But for that, you must first make a longer trip than just from your mom's trailer to the nearest Walmart. Wish you lots of luck! Stay positive, I believe in you! &lt;3
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:44:57


at this point, I realized that you have no idea what you're talking about. are you economically educated?
if anything, it had the opposite effect on countries that were considering quitting EU, now they see that it would be extremely stupid (experts knew it even before, now everyone knows it including people living in a village who just read the news)
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:22:04
You can forecast something if you assume that it's moving in a predictable pattern. Once it starts getting chaotic, it would be quite foolish. Of course you can try to predict at least very approximately, but trying to be precise is hard. There are so many factors involved, 90% of them you can't even see... hidden politics, unpredictable international conflicts etc.
That's why I think it's quite funny when I see someone say "BTC will be 20 000 at the end of the year!" or the opposite. No one can know this, it's pure gambling and speculation. Even forecasting an exchange rate of your own currency as a central bank is usually quite speculative, and that's being an institution that has all the available information.
We know so little about BTC that it's just crazy.
People probably tried in the past because they didn't think it would be moving in such a crazy fashion. I mean, if you actually predicted BTC would go from 100$ to 15 000$, hats off to you, you're probably one of the few people who got rich, but correct, that wasn't based on an economical forecast, it was an equivalent of going to a casino...
Also, it's kind of a sport to try and predict the market. But in these cases, it's not very scientific.
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:28:10
I mean of course, if I do look for credible sources, I'm not going to go to a subreddit (any subreddit, not just this one). It would just be interesting to see how many % of people discussing here are formally educated (or have years of related experience, but that doesn't usually give you the "big picture", of course there are exceptions like very talented billionaires), as sometimes it's more interesting to read "hands-on" discussions than scientific articles.

Predictions of value have everything to do with economics. Of course, lots of it is based on feeling, not something you can learn in school. But an economist will be more sucessful in forecasting than a farmer.
