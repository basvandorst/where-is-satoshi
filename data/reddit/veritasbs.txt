This is in fact true in other technology. Large manufactures build computers cheaper than small manufactures. Computer equipment runs for less cost in areas with lower electricity costs. The other tech has a different model for distribution than bitcoin mining where the main cost is electricity and warehousing.

This is an idea I've been working on also...with a few changes. 
1) The app would be a "ticket wallet". Basically a Bitcoin wallet used for BTC and colored coin tickets.
2) To use the ticket, you would spend the ticket at the gate with signed transaction. There would be no need to have a name associated with the ticket. 
3) There could be a listing site to facilitate the p2p transfer of tickets. This would let the "bit-ticket" replace stubhub. It would have many advantages over stubhub such as, no 10% fees, instant delivery, and with smart contracts, no counterparty risk on transfers of ownership.

This idea could be good for semisecure storage. Encrypt a geocode and private key together and you could have a password that only worked in a single location. It could make hacking More of a challange.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:10:32
[–]veritasBS 1 point 72 milliseconds ago
 
To build on your great idea, what about a storage/password app: 
No map in this app. A short password and the coordinates will be encrypted by the app. The app would basically just make a more difficult password that the user does not have to remember. It could help stop forgotten passwords because it could create a password that is secure and easy to remember. This would be almost like a "trusted" location. 
Say I am at home in my office and create the password SAM. A hacker could brute force that in no time....but if I (the user) add the password SAM, and the app adds coordinates of the device to the password then the password would be SAM40.42.56.38675.9.2.818.
The unencrypt would be: I enter the password SAM and the app adds the current coordinates. If I am on the correct coordinates the password will unencrypt. If I am not in the correct location the password will be incorrect. A hacker would have to brute force the password SAM40.42.56.38675.9.2.818. The user would only have to remember the password SAM and where he created the password...

"The theory posited by “the kid who started Doxbin“ to nachash was that the attack was an attempt to force connections to the site’s various .onion addresses to follow paths that went over Tor network nodes set up by law enforcement. By filling up the “circuits” through secure Tor network nodes, law enforcement operatives could have made it possible to connect to the services only through Tor routing servers they controlled—allowing them to see the real Internet Protocol address of the server hosting them."

The number of nodes on TOR has increased significantly over the past few years. Many of the new nodes are likely owned by the gov. If the gov can watch traffic enough, it can see routes through the nodes from clocking the messages. The gov buys stuff from these sites and are the receivers of the messages sent from these sites, if they control all the nodes in the random path the message takes, they can track the messages by the timing from beginning to end.

In 20 years Buffet (if he were still around) would invest in the banks and insurance companies dealing in bitcoin..."new" is not how he made his money. "New" is however how Gates, Allison, Zuckerburg, Page, Brin, Andresseen, ect. made their money.

Ok...I didn't understand OP's gripe. I was looking at like you but comparing it to just staying in fiat.
In the above scenario holding fiat you would have only 50% of purchasing power. Hold in btc while money supply doubles and you have 90% purchasing power. Fiat money supply stays the same but demand raises btc price, even with cap gains youre &gt;100% purchasing power. Inflation is the real thief.

This guy does not understand the next step for bitcoin in becoming a currency. Retailer adoption is just the first step. Once enough retailers accept bitcoin, companies like Dell, Expedia Overstock will start to pay some of their employees in bitcoin as a percentage of their wages. This will be opt in for the employees and will be useful to any employee that needs to transfer money, send money to home countries, or wants to separate their personal info from online purchases. This process will close the loop to where the bitcoins accepted by these companies are no longer converted to fiat. We are very close to this loop closing.
edit - spelling.

Although it is not my preferred option, reddits crypto/stock may not end up being a decentralized crypto. SEC requires the company to have information as to the ownership of its stock. reddit could require KYC info to get a wallet address or group of addresses.
 
reddit could control the blockchain and nodes to ensure the security of the ledger.

This is a great deal for the device manufacturers. The chips will be imbedded because it is profitable for the device manufactures. This is almost like an equipment lease with the purchase price for the device being the down payment.

Breathe deep and pay in Bitcoin
Gillian Tett
In the tropical idyll of Bali, dozens of merchants now accept payment in this electronic exchange system
Earlier this month, a friend called Mats, who works in banking in Switzerland, set off on a long holiday in Bali for a spell of relaxation between jobs. Hoping to forget about finance for a while, he duly booked himself into a modest hotel in Ubud, a far-flung resort famous for yoga retreats.
But when he arrived in his tropical idyll he got a shock: the seemingly otherworldly location is in the midst of a striking monetary experiment. Over the past year, dozens of local merchants in this part of Bali have started accepting payment in Bitcoin, the electronic exchange system that is sometimes dubbed a cryptocurrency. Such is the enthusiasm for this financial innovation that Ubud was even staging a so-called Bitcoin festival, pulling people in from all over the world.
“I have never seen anything like this,” Mats declared. If you want to be a hippy in 2014, you do not just need to wear a sarong and do yoga: one of the hottest ways to become subversive or countercultural is to pay your bar bill in Bitcoin. Even, or especially, in Bali.

It is a fascinating sign of how tightly entwined the global economy has become today. And how potentially peculiar too. On one level, the appearance of an alternative — quasi-subversive — currency is not wildly new. After all, investors have been putting money into gold for many decades, partly because they do not trust governments (or banks). And this mistrust has been rising rapidly in recent years, as western monetary experiments keep gathering pace — hence all those gold bars now sitting in Swiss banks.
But what is striking about the Bitcoin experiment is that it takes the issue of trust to a new level. Instead of relying on governments and banks to underpin currencies, investors are essentially placing their faith in a complicated piece of cryptography and software, maintained by a community of volunteers and users with possibly conflicted interests and diverse levels of skill and commitment – and people have as little knowledge about how it really works as they have about Wall Street financial products or central bank balance sheets. To my mind, at least, that almost makes it seem rational to have faith in gold bars.
Consider for a moment how the Bitcoin project works. The currency first emerged some five years ago, when a mysterious computer expert called Satoshi Nakamoto created an online payment system using open-sourced software. This, essentially, is a peer-to-peer exchange system — using a unit of value known as Bitcoin — that does not require a central administrator or repository, since payments are recorded in a central public electronics ledger, which is maintained by the community.
In theory, this community element is supposed to give users more independence. It is also meant to confer greater credibility to currency than fiat money. After all, the beauty of using Bitcoin is that you do not need to rely on costly and slow-moving bank payment systems: “money” can be sent to or exchanged anywhere in the world. And the value of that money will not be wiped out if a government suddenly decides to turn on the printing press. Instead, the number of Bitcoins in circulation can only increase at a fixed rate each year, and in 2140 the total supply of Bitcoins will be capped at 21 million — or so the protocols say. This ensures that the “value” is democratically determined by supply and demand.
But, in reality, it is clear that the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, just like any other asset. Over the past two years, for example, Bitcoin’s value soared from $50 per Bitcoin (in 2012) to $1,150 (in late 2013), before collapsing this year to under $400, when a scandal erupted about the use of Bitcoin for money laundering. That makes Bitcoin arguably the worst-performing asset this year. Worse still, it is also clear that Bitcoin only works as a “currency” if people have rock-solid faith in their computers. After all, the risk of having electronic ledgers as the store of value is that the money could disappear if hackers broke into the system. Indeed, it can disappear if you just lose your electronic “key”, ie passcode. (And there are cases of that happening when people have accidentally wiped their hard drive, say, or lost their records.)
 . . . 
Of course, a cynic might argue that this same point about cyber risk also applies to modern global finance and many other aspects of the business world. And they do not appear to be stopping Bitcoin’s expansion, even into emerging markets. Never mind Bali bars; last week Microsoft announced it would accept Bitcoin for some accounts. Groups such as Dell, Expedia, Zynga, Virgin Galactic, PayPal and Atomic Mail have started accepting it too. Greenpeace and Wikimedia accept it for donations, and some US political candidates have declared they would accept Bitcoin campaign finance.
The more the Bitcoin revolution spreads, the more it reveals both the perils and power of innovation. The cyber technology that now ties our world together has made us dependent on potentially fragile cyber links. But it has also shrunk the globe, delivered extraordinary convenience and is making us all think afresh. Even my banker friend Mats. These days, he says he is (healthily) wary of Bitcoin. But he has nevertheless acquired a wallet of the cryptocurrency to bring with him back to Europe, as a travel souvenir-cum-modern equivalent of a gold bar. It might yet make some useful Christmas presents — and Santa might spin in his (electronic) sack.

This is not a knock on bitcoin currency. 
The idea of blockchain tech has value even if bitcoin currency is not used however there must be some digital measure of value for any blockchain to be secured. For the bitcoin blockchain its bitcoins that are the measure of value. Other blockchains can be secured by different tokens of value. These different tokens can even be exchangeable for a fiat currency. We all know this.

Right...when/if. This is why the miners would need +50% of hash to make this attack work. This is silent attack vs the 51% network attack that would be clear to observers. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:16:53
I must be missing something...
If only 1000 transactions will fit in a block, the mempool could be filled with fee paying transactions and the transactions with the highest fees would be added. The cap is what makes the attack work.
If there was no transaction limit, a benevolent miner could add all transactions in the mempool (of course risking orphan). In this situation the attack could not work.

The coin is not to be transacted with for goods directly. There will never be merchant adoption in GEMZ. It only exists to incentivise the network. This "coin" is no competition to BTC it will bring many into BTC. The GEMZ token s to price the network for advertisers who wish to participate.

The attacking miners earn the fees from their own transactions when they mine them...so basically the money is returned to them. 
If the pool is filled with the attacking miners high fee transactions it will force higher fees to move any bitcoin. If the miners have enough hash and the network is sufficiently busy the attack would pay by getting higher transaction fees on the +50% blocks the attackers mine.

It would take only a few million devices to cause mining to be unprofitable for the great majority of ASIC farms. I would be interested to see math on this...it would have to come from someone much more intelligent that me:) 
Edit: The effect could snowball also...as more ASIC farms shut down, less subsidy would be needed for the decentralized mining devices making them less of a 'bad' way to acquire BTC.

When the other places I shop accept BTC I will use it to transact at those places. Right now people have to go out of their way to use BTC and purchase from retailers they would not normally purchase from. I am not willing to do that and I think most others will not either.

You should look at BitHalo escrow. Buyer and seller both add a deposit to the escrow so there is an incentive to complete the transaction. 
Item for sale - $30
Seller deposit - $30
Buyer deposit - $30 + $30 for item
When buyer and seller agree transaction is complete and sign transaction, the $30 deposits are returned.

Yes it would be the same position. I call myself a non-theist because most uninformed people believe all atheists are strong/hard atheists. 
I do not believe gods do not exist, I just find no reason/evidence to believe the proposition/claim that gods exists. Although I acknowledge the possibility gods exist the same way I acknowledge the possibility Bigfoot and unicorns exist but like gods, I do not have reason to believe they in fact do exist.

No it is not. The definition listed is the common usage definition but not the correct definition. This is similar to how the term "theory" is misused and misunderstood by people who do not understand evolution.
Theism/Atheism are regarding belief.
Gnostic/Agnostic are regarding knowledge.
If you believe a deity exists you are a theist. If you hold any other position you are then an Atheist simply because you are not a theist. Almost all atheists are agnostic-atheists which means they have not placed a belief in a god AND leave open the possibility that there may be a god. 
Atheist is a grouping of any position that does not have belief in deities. The grouping includes agnostic-atheists, gnostic- atheists, it also includes people who have a belief that no gods exist. These people are commonly referred to "hard" atheists. 
Edit: clarification of last paragraph.

You are very likely correct that agnostic-atheist has been shortened due to social stigma and this has lead to the common confusion of the terms. I usually refer to my position as a "non-theist" due the the confusion over the terms.

It would make the first nation "early adopters". As BTC becomes more legitimate due to the state switching currencies. The rest of the world and speculators will bid up the price of BTC. The first country then holds an asset/currency increasing in value in comparison to other currencies. This makes the country have more comparable wealth.

GetGems is the best idea I've seen to get new people into crypto. There is NO competition for BTC from GEMZ or any other coin. BTC will always be the real money/store of value coin in the crypto ecosystem. 
Other application specific coins will get people into the crypto ecosystem. I'm sure we will see these coins used a coupons, gift cards and rewards points. These coins will all be interchangeable with BTC. These application specific coins will bring in new users/owners and drive adoption of crypto. THIS IS A GREAT THING FOR BITCOINERS and the crypto ecosystem.

Why would ASIC miners cause a price rise? People were selling BTC to buy ASIC's at that time. ASIC's arrival brought in most of the for-profit farms that dump their coins to cover costs.

Yes I do. Look down to the "free movement of capital and payments" section of the article you posted. How does one send cash to another country unless is deposited in a Bank account or Western Union type service? Do you think the IRS is worried about the act of deposit or the eventual payments/transfers the depositor will make?

There will not be profit to share. Their decentralized altruistic mining idea can cause mining farms to be unprofitable very quickly. Could lead to decentralization of mining.

And just over a year from now it will cost only $140 million dollars (at $220 per coin) to support the network. 
This year will see more adoption and more real use cases which will support price. When the mined coins flooding the market are reduced by half, the price will increase.

@_date: 2015-02-23 16:54:14
I agree with this. This is something I have been thinking about also. 
The act of a country switching to BTC would completly
legitimize the bitcoin currency in everyone's mind. The citizens would be the first to switich and therefore be early adopters. As the rest of the world buys in to BTC the price per coin will rise in every comparable currency. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 14:04:06
You are conveniently forgetting the run up in expectation of the halving. LTC went up 8x in the 2 months before the halving and then settled and is currently at 3x the price before the run.

"The whole anarchist viewpoint that humanity is basically good, has been proven wrong once again." - You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Anarchist/free market say that everyone works in their own self interest. When there is more profit to be made running a legitimate business than stealing it will push thieves to the fringes of economy.
"When there's no punishment, no rules, and no fear of prison"  - Punishment for theft has nothing to do with regulation...how many of the bankers that stole trillions of dollars went to jail?
"The mindset that corruption only exists in the world of authority figures is absolute and complete bullshit." - True, but no one is saying that. Corruption that can exist behind lawful force (the state) and is protected by regulation is what leads us to our current financial/power situation. 4 trillion dollars was just stolen in the most regulated industry ever know to man...and no one went to jail.
"If there are no rules, and no punishments, then you aren't going to be able to walk out your front door without fear of someone harming you. That's an unrealistic world to live in and an idiotic worldview to have." - You may need a clearer view of the subject matter. Lack of regulation does not mean there is no punishment for theft.

Basicaly this would make the first country to switch early adopters of BTC. The country switching currencies should buy as large a stash of BTC as possible before announcing. The act of switching currencies will exponentially increase the dollar value of their BTC holdings thereby increasing their comparable wealth.

No one goes to jail BECAUSE of regulations. No individual in these companies who made the decisions to commit crime was held accountable BECAUSE of regulations. Ever hear of the corporate veil? It's regulated immunity for corporate crime. 
You need to put some time into undestanding the purpose of regulations and the extent of corruption in designing these regulations. In many cases the regulated industry use political influence to write their own regulations to protect their business models. You should check out the political influance flatline studies before you form such a strong opinion on the matter. Many people in Bitcoin saying the things you disagree with are the most informed on the subject matter. Take the time to inform yourself.
