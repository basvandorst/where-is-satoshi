If they wanted to kill bitcoins they would remove it from coinbase and gdax, that would kill BTC in an instant

hows the 3 days confirmation pend working out for you unless you put up a 10$ fee

"My transaction went through at the lowest point of the day so this means its not slow at al!!!"
And it's nowhere near as low as 10 cents in 2012 new fag, there's no fucking reason to pay 5$ free even if Western union takes bigger fees

Bitfinex is basiclly making these "tethers" out of nowhere which is considered money to buy Bitcoins with on their exchanges and any exchange that uses USDT(tether)
so bitfinex is making and printing money that doesnt exist to pump BTC up, you really didnt think it was real money that caused the 4000&gt;8000$ did you?

"dont argue or discuss with me i want to be right!!!!111"

lol nigga the only difference right now with BTC is that it would take half a day instead of a full day, probably with higher free as well where my segwit at??

gotta make sure price is pumped by tethers to 10k first before everything else
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:16:07
wish bitfinex could just make another billion in money that doesnt exist and we'll hit 100k

this literally makes no fucking sense why would the price of fees have to go up when the price of the coins go up, sending 5$ is the same as sending 5$ right now


you mean 6 hours UNLESS you want to use a ridiclious fee, there is no reason you should pay a 5$ fee on a 5$ transaction

"having a 10$ fee on a 5$ transaction is completely fine even though it will take almost 12 hours" 
this is  what you said summed up basicly, fucking normie

I thought off-topic discussions werent allowed

Sign what? a 10$ fee on a 5$ product? 12 hours for a payment to CONFIRM? are you fucking joking? litecoins sure bitcoins not untill all the bullshit is sorted

Also, why is blockchain.info lying about private keys? I tried to export my private key to electrum and the private key they give me is not the the private key to the address WITH THE FUNDS, its a completely different one WTF
