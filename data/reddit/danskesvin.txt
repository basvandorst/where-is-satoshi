Probably because miners and maintenance is expensive, and it's not that easy to get a bank loan if you show up from nowhere saying "I wanna build a big fucking bitcoin mining data center". For life time contracts they make a living profit on the maintenance fees while 1-2 year contracts means that they take back the miner after the time runs out allowing them to mine with it as long it's profitable.

It's not gonna crash, the price may fall temporary if more people are selling then buying but with a lower price more people will buy. It's common market psychology.

He's tweets wasn't the real reason for the price drop either like he and MSM thinks. The Chinese exchanges just opened for withdrawal again and we all know what happens when lot's of Chinese people learns that they can withdraw their money after a 200% value increase again, we've seen it before.

The average fiat user :P

That guy who think he's tweets caused the recent drop in price and brags about it when it's in fact the Chinese exchanges who opened for withdrawal who caused the price drop.

$2750 absolute minimum, not sure why it dropped tho, could be correction or because some rich idiot yelled "bubble". I bought at $2920 so I guess I'll have to wait a few more hours or days before it's profitable to sell :)

Actually most of these card companies are just like normal banks with the diference that you also have a bitcoin account you can connect your card to. You're not anonymous, the fees are high, limits are low and the system is centralized so at some moment you'll try to pay and the payment system is down. Just like in a normal bank. But at least you can pay anywhere without having to exchange to fiat first, that's always some improvement.

Well you could always get one of those credit/debit cards that supports direct payments with bitcoin. Sure there are fees but it's the same with any bank and you wouldn't have to pay tax since the money is still in bitcoin.

Depends, I'm pretty sure the price will go up in the coming days so I bought too. Best of luck :)

All fiat currencies are bubbles, just look at the great depression 1929. The two world wars and the cold war, has any crypto currency ever caused a war or made people jump out from a tall building in attempted suicide? nope, not even after the 2013 "crash" which we must all remember was caused by the bad security in the exchange website and not bitcoin itself.

10 is based on a linear increase from start until today, the actual graph however is not linear but closer to exponential so I'd say you need 1 maybe 2. In 10 years mining profit per block will be 3.125 so the inflation may be nearly non-existent by then.

If it is the core wallet you can just install the core wallet on your current PC, connect the drive and point the data directory to this drive, it will start to sync and meanwhile you can see the balance as it was the day you left it, don't forget to make a backup first and good luck

Price is defined by a few thousand coin on the exchanges based on the markets demands and availability. Even during the worst "crash" in history 2013 the price went from $100 to $1100 then a bottom at $200 before it started to increase again. From $100 to $200 there's a 100% increase, and that was the bubble bursting. 
What we can learn from this is that patience is the key, even those who bought at the top of $1100 around 2013 would have a 150% increase if they sold today. Of course the price on exchanges will vary a lot when people trade all the time just to get more fiat but what if the value was defined by something else than fiat. What if it isn't the bitcoin price that goes up and down but the fiat price?

Since exchanges deals with fiat currencies and also technically provides banking services for fiat currencies they must follow the same rules and regulations as normal banks. After buying you should move your coins to a secure self hosted wallet for best anonymity.

Well it depends if you wanna live the rest of your life like some kind of former master criminal, i.e laying low despite being a billionaire. I have no doubt in further increases in crypto prices but if you declare bankruptcy and then starts to buy expensive shit the government are gonna notice.
It's better to do it the legal way, i.e invest as much as you can afford to loose, let the crypto price raise further, pay your loans, buy a credit card that supports crypto currencies to use in stores that doesn't accept crypto yet, and then you can say "fuck you, banks" without consequences.

Actually genesis doesn't call it lifetime, they call it "open ended" which means (according to their terms) that after 20 days of not making any profit the contract is cancelled. I've been mining there for years now and they still haven't cancelled my contract even though it's been close sometimes. Hashflare seems better tho since they offer true life time contracts where the contract may be paused and then resumed if you can't pay the maintenance fee.

You're right, $2790 now according to coincap.io I'm not an expert in any way but I think it's started to rise again
