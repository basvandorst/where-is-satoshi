It is pretty simple. It will take a few months or atleast one year, to reach the new heights when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Matthew Mcconaughey's character said it perfectly in Wolf of Wall Street that no one knows where the stock is going even if you are f\*\*\*ing Warren Buffet or something. But as the interest of cryptocurrency enthusiast will surely surge once again in coming months, it is highly likely that prices for bitcoin will shot up once again but it will be more of a mid-term to long-term investment rather than a short-term investment

With the vulnerability involved with Bitcoin and vested interests of individual governments, it is all to unlikely that we will ever have a "Worldwide" currency. There are already known problems in maintaining a regional currency like Euro for a continent that has decided to form a multi-government organisation such as EU. 
and by the way, what does it even mean by NYSE owner? It is my understanding that such large platforms are not owned single handedly. After all, it is an internationally recognized hub of business, not some middle eastern monarchy.

and will be back even quicker...untill and unless, bitcoin in particular and cryptocurrency in general doesn't shed the aura of being a volatile commodity, no serious buyer or investor will ever be attracted to it. Don't forget that financial systems might be sucker for risk based products but only when they consider them "too big to fail"

well, until and unless , bigger players start holding on to the coins over a longer period of time...Bitcoin price will keep coming down
