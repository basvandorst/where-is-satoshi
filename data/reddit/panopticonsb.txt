Deep purple smoke on the water till the bottom fall out
** Deep purple is a reference again to the deep part of the visible spectrum, but then also a reference to deep purple weed, but then also a reference to the Deep Purple song "Smoke on the Water, but then also a reference to a gravity bong where there is literally smoke on the water, with a possible reference to the bottom falling out when the plastic bottle raises above the surface of the water when filling the gravity bong or possibly a reference to when you construct a crude gravity bong, without a sieve, the marijuana can fall into the water (bottom falls out)**
Of all this hacking im doing till my rep is in ruin
**The bottom can also fall out when you've hacked so much that your reputation causes you to be actively sought by the authorities**
Tryin to make the best of a movement
** Trying to make it as a musical artist in the nerd rap genre/movement**
Steady pursuing a fluency to see what theyll do to me

Im an internet virus
** I am everywhere on the internet/popular for my nerd rap **
Proficient with devices that require a stylus
** I have used and likely still own a Palm Pilot **
I admit i got a bias towards any batch of silicon that be rockin a BIOS
** Computer microprocessors are fabricated from bools of silicon cut into wafers. Each wafer has a complicated sequence of microfabrication processes appied to it to produce many devices on one wafer (a batch). ytcracker prefers computers, which have a BIOS on them**
Dont DENY this firewall rules apply this
** DENY is in capital letters because in the ruleset of a computer firewall, the individual lines enforcing rules on what to allow or deny on the firewall are in capital letters**
Puter hepatitis all on disc sell a fix
** Use a computer virus to hold the users' data hostage, encrypting it, and then selling the key for a price to retrieve their data**
Call it ransomware get me a handsome heir
** Being successful at this action of holding user data hostage for money will gain me much money, which will cause attractive women to associate with me, leading to a high likelihood of having attractive offspring **
For the throne when my ass be gone
** ytcracker is the king of nerd rap, but someday he'll be gone, and needs an heir to takeover **
I got a phone (tether up)
** ytcracker's cell phone can be used to tether its data connection to allow him to use his computer from anywhere there is cellular data service**
Riding on chrome (talking bout the browser pup)
** ytcracker drives an automobile that has chrome wheels, but also uses the Chrome browser on his smartphone, and the reference to "pup" is a reference to unwanted malware installed onto the browser labeled Potentially Unwanted Program **
Im a force of nature rpg pen and the paper
** A force of nature is generally very powerful, which ytcracker is, but also a reference to the Druid class spell in World of Warcraft that summons a Treant, but also ytcracker is old school enough to have played RPGs using a pen and paper, namely Dungeons and Dragons**
Code breaker data scraper
**ytcracker as a hacker and spammer has experience in bypassing encryptions or authentication systems, as well as using automated computer programs to retrieve (scrape) e-mail addresses and other information from various sources to generate a list used in spamming**
Admin on a rampage the spampage
** the administrator of a server, perhaps an SMTP relay, is very angry at the incredible amount of spam that ytcracker as a spammer was able to send after hacking it**
Beckoning a series of clicks on my cam page
** ytcracker earns money by users who receive his spam being directed to a pornographic website, where they are enticed to click certain buttons to generate ad revenue for ytcracker, before being allowed to see naked women or men on the website**
Im showing my damn age
**ytcracker reveals his age to be in his late 20s to early 30s by referencing older rpgs like dungeons and dragons**
Everytime i reminisce about the "good ol days"
**there were many good times to be had in both RPGs and spamming. RPGs like dungeons and dragons and now WoW are essentially classics, and spamming has become more difficult from the days when AOL did not litigate anyone (they considered the activity of sending unsoliciated e-mail a hobby), and there were not organized efforts against spammers that included posting their personal details in an act of retribution in the Spamhaus ROKSO database**
But them days ain't over
** There are, however, still ways to send spam successfully even today**
Cuz im still up on the block standing head and shoulders
** Even though I have a longer history of spam and hacking, I am able to still generate new methods for sending spam**
In them inbox folders out foxin mulders with a method
** The spam when sent by ytcracker ends up not in the spam folder, but in the Inbox folder, defeating the naive Bayesian spam classifiers employed by most e-mail systems today. ytcracker has out-smarted/out-foxed these spam classifiers. The use of the word 'fox' is then connected with Fox Mulder, the shrewd main character in the X Files. His method was successful, and this is also a reference to a 'method' of a class in object oriented programming**
That will leave the block smoldered
** The success of this spamming technique will leave everyone amazed**
Cuz im a dragon dictating my ethos
** ytcracker is using the Dragon Simply Speaking software to dictate, perhaps, his lyrics **
The beat goes on and i hack the gibson
** Time continues, but also a reference to the Sonny and Cher song 'The Beat Goes On'. Even though time is progressing, ytcracker is still able to hack into the big systems (embodied by the term 'gibson' from the 1994 movie Hackers that used the term to reference supercomputers used for scientific applications or oil exploration) **
Root admission bitching bout the government mission
** When a computer system is broken into, the hacker typically wants to gain 'admission' or access to the root (administrator) account of the machine that has unlimited privileges. When obtaining root access to a website, the hacker may choose to 'deface' the website, perhaps with a message taunting or complaining about government actions**
On attrition pimpin whos the master of this science fiction
**Defaced websites end up on the website attrition.org as a sort of archive**
(im an internet bandit) stoned as granite
** ytcracker as a notorious hacker is both legendary (written in stone) but also high on marijuana on occasion. Granite is one of the hardest rocks, so he is both very legendary and very high**

Trying to keep my landers landed
** A reference to the difficulty of landing a space module (for instance, the lunar lander). This reference to a spaceship is a reference to ytcracker being high (commanding said spaceship) and attempting to still maintain the cogency to perform activities like hacking and spamming that require some higher level brain functionality. The reference to landers is also a reference to the primary page that shows up in search engine results or a spam link with the intent of garnering clicks from users and converting them using advertising material into successful sales**
Then spam it collect a bunch of clicks on a hypertext canvas
** The spam contains links to these lander pages. The spammer hopes to generate many clicks on a page that typically contains many images. Clicking any of these images will direct the user to other ad material or give them the ability to order the product being marketed, 'converting' them into a successful sale **
Do my damndest to keep the advantage
Brandishing a package of packets of dirty bandwidth
** Dirty bandwidth is a reference to stolen bandwidth on a hacked server, which can then be directed towards sending mass e-mails (spam) **
To jam with build a stack and feed em a sandwich
** Possibly a reference to building a stack in computer programming where objects can be 'pushed' and 'popped' onto and off of the stack **
From a campus box that i rooted in the middle of kansas
** The computer ytcracker has broken into is a University server, which typically has a very large amount of bandwidth, even if it is in a sparsely populated region like Kansas**
My fans is loyal and im leading that charge like a red alert tesla coil
** ytcracker has many loyal fans; the Tesla Coil was one of the most powerful weapons in the game Command and Conquer, so ytcracker is leading his very powerful army of fans**
From us soil stateside solid state drive
Encoded with the data that i need to survive
** When leaving the United States on travel, ytcracker uses a solid state drive that contains encrypted data he can use as ransom if arrested **
Against a hive mind drones that would stand to deny mine
How they treat us hackers it would serve as a guide line
** The authorities may treat ytcracker poorly, similar to edward snowden or chesea manning. Hive mind is a reference to the phenomena of Reddit users having similar thoughts, which could be seen as a form of groupthink, which is referred to as the Reddit hivemind.  **
1984 they got a fix on the timeline
** Reference to George Orwell's 1984 novel on a dystopian authoritarian future without original thought, e.g. groupthink**
I grind mine in the name of computer crime i'm
Vicious - still all about the business
** In the end, these activities of computer hacking and spamming are ultimately about providing an income for oneself, so ytcracker will continue the hard work (grinding) of hacking and spamming to continue to do so**
Holding grudges and forgoing forgiveness
** ytcracker will hold a grudge and not forgive a person who 'snitches' to the authorities **
Cause i witness people on the scene with a sickness
Snitching on their friends for a deal with a quickness
** ytcracker has observed this act of 'snitching' very often, where hackers who are caught will quickly reveal information about other hackers in exchange for a reduced plea instead of holding out honorably **
Hammond hit a backdoor broke up into stratfor
** One such case was the case of Jeremy Hammond who was snitched on and arrested in association with the e-mail leaks in 2012 from the private intelligence website Stratfor **
On the orders of a government actor
** The person who outed Hammond was known as Sabu, and was the founder of LulzSec, an anonymous computer hacking group, who had been caught by the FBI. The FBI coerced him into maintaining his relationships with other hackers and gathering evidence on them for the FBI, i.e. becoming an informant. Furthermore, there may be evidence that using Sabu, the FBI entrapped Hammond into committing computer fraud against Stratfor **
But they dont factor any of that in his sentencing
"hes menacing; an anarchist subversive whos peddling
The wrong ideology"
** Even though we was entrapped, the prosecution is mostly focused on obtaining a conviction and do not care about the particular circumstances of Hammond's crimes**
Get them hackers to follow me 'fore they bottle me
Cause i gotta be an oddity set up in the music economy
** Ideally, ytcracker would like to gain a large enough following to exit the computer hacking and spamming business before he is caught and imprisoned. If he can gain a large enough income stream for his music-related activities, considered "odd" or "niche" since he is a nerd rapper, he could cease the hacking and spam activities done to support himself**
Theyre on to me cause im still a computer prodigy
** The authorities are already aware of ytcracker, primarily because at a young age he hacked into one of NASA's Goddard Space Center computers that hosted a website and defaced it, for which he was caught**
No modesty when it comes to hacking the planet
** ytcracker is gifted in computer hacking, and is unabashed. The reference to hacking the planet is the catchphrase "hack the planet!" again from the 1994 movie Hackers.**
Spitting on a microphone or puffing organic
** ytcracker is also unabashed when it comes to nerdrap music or smoking marijuana **
Represent defendants like im jennifer granick
** In fact, he is proud and owns it (represents). The word represent is also used in reference to Jennifer Granick, associated with a civil liberties outfit at Stanford, who has represented high profile hacking cases such as Aaron Swartz **
Hacker mechanic sending science all across the atlantic
** ytcracker's words are heard around the world, including across the Atlantic from the United States where he resides**
Dont panic
** Across the Atlantic is the country of the United Kingdom, where the BBC originally broadcasted the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In the novel form of these broadcasts, the phrase "Don't Panic" is on the cover**
P.S. lolformatting but i'm too lazy to fix it. STC is the greatest
