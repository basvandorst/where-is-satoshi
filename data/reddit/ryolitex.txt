Maybe you might need to determine if you are attempting to contact an owner of a franchise, or a corporate VP.. You may have better luck talking to a shop owner in person. If they own the franchise, they can make that decision. If however you want every Pizza Hut to have the BTC option, you will need to contact someone at the corporate level. Try it, send a certified letter to the VP of whatever dept and see if you get a reply.

Navigate to C:/users/***/appdata/roaming/multibit/multibit.spvchain) and delete multibit.spvchain 
Restart, it should resync

Remember it's very easy, you have the option of holding your BTC or exchange for $ and you can get free publicity as well by being a 1st in the SF Bay Area... If a Round Table were to accept BTC I would start to get fat...

And it's safe to conclude i don't give a rats ass what you think.

The ability to "see" your theoretical balance does not quit constitute a site being "online" in relative context to normal service as in the past. I would venture to guess that the answer to your query of "can I get my bitcoins (sic) back yet" would be:
----------&gt; No. You Cannot.

Screw you. My hard drive crashed.

That will be a side chain I would think...

Hope this will help in some way if it is accepted by your brother.

Hey Western Union: If you were smart you would provide a BTC to fiat local cash in your worldwide facilities... You could take a cut of course, but also provide a merge of your services, with ease of use.. For example, let's say Jose in California sends BTC to mom DIRECT (without WU) in Mexico.. in the desert.. only there is a local WU in a shop near mom.. she takes her cell phone to you and WU converts the BTC to cash. There. Still in the loop. Better hurry tho.. Of course you could also provide a Local Currency -&gt; BTC service as well.. Hrmm.. maybe UPS would be interested.. after all if you already have the local kiosks set up..

Damn missed it! already 4 confirmations...

We could have a bar and sing BTC songs!

Can you pay for them with clean fiat cash that has never been used for anything "questionable"?
