I have done many transaction with them around 180 Bitcoin a month with more then SGD80,000 volume and still I get this kind of services, I hope that in time they can improve their services but still it is very disappointing.

Hi Rick good day, I am still not getting my cash withdrawal since I request withdrawal on 26 December 2014 and confirmation send on Tuesday 30 December 2014, as you can see from withdrawal request it took 5 days(3working days) to process before IGOT send the TT confirmation and for the TT it self will took 2 days or more to received, so overall process took more then a week or more to get our cash in our bank, and my previous experience with you guys is half a month when you guys have problem with your banker. Which I can see that IGOT internal management and operation do have problem and thing are not well plan ahead.

To consider or not to trade in IGOT it depend on individual choice if you are a active trader with high volume and cash flow is an important issue, IGOT will not be the choice as their cash withdrawal service is currently very very poor for high volume trading, if you are not trading very frequent and cash flow is not an issue you can consider it an option, we are not sure if it is financially stable or not as IGOT is a new start-up and currently the only way to reach them is through support ticket, they don't provide any contact number or skype support and they response very very slow.

Hello rick perhaps you guys should be more transparent about the cash withdrawal process , write it down on the help page , as currently my withdrawal still took around 5-7 days to received not as promise by Julie 3-4 working days , I would like to increase my trade volume on IGOT but still hesitating because of the slow support response time and withdrawal time.
