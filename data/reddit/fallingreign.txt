Sounds similar to every YouTube video I’ve ever seen on price speculation. 
I often wonder about/hope someone creates YouTube channel that has 15 second videos each time they buy/sell that show a chart and say “today I bought/sold, I think it will go up/sideways/down. This is why”

How about setting up a ETH contract that can be executed on death. 
For example.
On attempted execution of the contract it notifies you, if you dont react and cancel the execution within x time the keys are revealed.
You could even add other measures like passwords to protect yourself if you like.

True, I'm not an expert in the matter
To answer your question, They would be revealed to the person executing the contract or to whom you would like them revealed.

And the reason they are still holding is likely they still see the potential value.
