Maybe he does and is hinting that it was someone who died recently.

I it is inherited at $0 so you will be taxed 100% of what you sell (there may be a tax on the value itself that I am unaware of).  If you sell any within 1 year it is taxed as income.  However, if it is sold in more than a year then it is capital gains which currently means you would have a 0% federal tax on the first $39000 gain, so you can essentially sell that much every year if you wait for one with no taxes.  Get a new wallet if you just inherited a full wallet, memorize your keys wallet and passphrases (practice every day).  The gain on bitcoin could very easily outpace your loan interest so although you could just pay it off, it may not be the best choice with taxes and gains factored in (remember that student loan interest is a write off).

Basically.  Looking at the growth of current large (1,000+ coins) wallets I think buyers at $20,000 is no stretch since there is no need to buy a whole bitcoin and the age group that has the greatest interest in bitcoin is moving into their saving years.  Do you think the price per satoshi would rise if it was sold as such since there wouldn't be the psychological deterant of a high price?  I mean I would be stoked at a $0.01 Satoshi price point.

One of those things will likely happen within a few months the other would mean that even posting would be a complete waste of your time.

When the owner of an organization starts downplaying and bad talking bitcoin in the same 3 month period his team starts accepting bitcoin as payment something is up.  He either likes having novelties for the sake of novelties or believes it will grow in value and wants to keep the price lower to accumulate before it does so.

Stock to flow is in short a measure of how much of something is held vs how much new comes in.  In the case of litecoin it means less is being held (i.e. people that currently have are reselling it at a higher rate than those holding Bitcoin).  The reason stock to flow model works is because less new stock means less supply growth, but demand still plays a role.  In the case of bitcoin we see more people accumulate and not sell so it will likely see a bigger price change as a result of halving as a similar amount of buyers may be competing for half the amount of bitcoin driving price higher, but it is not an overnight change and overrunning s/f is what causes overly steep rises and corrections.

 [  You mean sending children to private school instead of public.  taking out a loan on a new car vs buying one a couple years older, saving 38,000 per year toward retirement, saving for college (which most people can't do), buying new clothes every month, 3 weeks of vacation a yr (high for the US), and going to sporting events ($500 monthly entertainment budget) can be expensive.  This may be considered middle class now a days, but they could easily spend better in a lot of areas.

Exactly.  Too many people today think they are entitled to a celebrity level lifestyle when reality is much different.
