There are reports of Coinbase watching the coins you buy from them, and then banning you if they see you’ve spent them on something notionally illicit (off-shore gambling was one, I think buying cannabis seeds was the other, idk).

I’m not the expert, and happy to have someone explain where I’m wrong, but I think there’s a patent (ASICBoost) that gives Bitmain an advantage/monopoly rent situation with BCH (that was nullified with the Segwit softfork)

So.....during the Roman siege of Jerusalem....66 AD-ish, per Josephus:


Having been stationed in Biloxi, MS shortly after Hurricane Katrine, and thus given way too much time to think about the end of the world, I came to the conclusion that crates of shotgun shells would be a reasonable store of value, for at least 5-10 years or so.

What’s *your* backup strategy?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:10
What the hell happened? giant walls were duking it out at $8499.02-3 and then &gt;&lt;poof&gt;&lt;
and the BCH price on coinbase *immediately* corrected to $3,299.49
Like, I'm not one to get too suspicious over little things.....but.....I'm suspicious.

Right now:
Poloniex: $13581.74
GDAX:     $14090.00
CEX.io:    $14855.09
I *really* need to figure out a system for arbitrage....

And I believe that if you renounce your citizenship you need to attest that there’s no giant amount of wealth you’re hiding and there’s a number of years after you renounce citizenship that they can/will go after you if you get suddenly rich.
Listen, and understand: The IRS is out there. It can’t be bargained with. It can’t be reasoned with. It doesn’t feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until they collect their taxes.

i think it might be different using 'trade' vs. 'sell'. like the extra fees for buying on coinbase vs gdax? maybe. i'm running a trial balloon right now but am being hampered by the transfer times and by rum. i'll have to keep track of fees and stuff, and hope i don't fat-finger a send address.

The fees kill you when buying small on coinbase. Pro tip: deposit USD to coinbase, then use your coinbase credentials to log into GDAX and buy using limit orders and avoid fees alltogether.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:18:55
yeah, if you're on coinbase/gdax, this is the natural answer.
its been weird to go out and pay for dinner lately and see the balance in my account *increase*....

What I was saying was this:
Deposit USD to the USD wallet on Coinbase.
Wait til the deposit clears
Log into GDAX with your coinbase credentials (they’re the same outfit)
Transfer USD from coinbase USD wallet to GDAX
So far, no fees
Now, look at the price charts. Use the Limit buy option to set the price per bitcoin you want to buy in at, set the number of coins you want to buy.
Wait, and if the market dips you’ve bought in at the dip
No fees
Send the bitcoin to you Trevor and HODL or sell at next ATH and buy back in at next dip.
Buying on coinbase gives you instant price freeze, but you pay like 2-4% fees it seems. If you can plan ahead, you can avoid fees and maybe get lucky and buy dips while you’re sleeping.
Don’t go crazy, but take baby steps and see if it works for you.

Game theory, I guess. The title references the famous Prisonor Dilemma, and two of the authors work for Microsoft Research.
I don’t think it makes any conclusions about the free market, per se.

The term you’re looking for is [resilient cooperator](
@_date: 2019-04-26 06:44:15
Experimenters determine that, in a series of games/experiments, that a significant fraction of humans make cooperative, pro-social choices at the expense of short term benefits — even in the face of defectors.  The conclusion is that rational, long term strategy might include sacrifice for pro-group outcome optimization because one heuristically determines that  being taken advantage of short term might still benefit one if the long term health of the group provides better benefits than if the entire group individually pursued a me-first strategy.
TLDR: not being a dick is a good strategy when it inspires other players to not be a dick — even if there are other dick players around.

Yeah it’s the exact same strategy pharma companies use to ‘prove’ the efficacy of their newest patented drug:  fund 10 trials and only publish the 1 that shows a benefit over the genetic form.

yeah. the process of people using 'truth' and 'facts' to lie and mislead has been an *objet de fascination* for me lately....

This is actually a really interesting issue with the military and the military's self-awareness (certainly a challenge for *any* large organization).

...and the Senate's official post-mortem: [
Basically, the Air Force has many (many, many) archaic and disconnected computer systems that they use for budgeting and procurement. Moving data is laborious, manual, error-prone, and time consuming.  In order to meet the Congressional mandate to be able to report their expenses and budgeting, the Air Force decided to build its own, modern computer system that would replace the heterogeneous pile of stuff that it had been using.
The problem was that they basically started writing stuff (e.g. paying a contractor to start scraping stuff together) before they had understood the problem. Then they got push-back from the various stake-holders in the organization. And, it seems, the modern US military is stacked with middle managers, and no one had any core competence with computer system design or project management. So it all ended up being a waste.
To quote from the third reference:
 


So, calling it "stealing" isn't really accurate, when it is more a matter of the wide acceptance of incompetence and waste (c.f. Hanlon's Razor).
This would seem to be an issue that blockchain technology could make progress towards solving. But, until there's an off-the-shelf product produced by a large company that has made the right campaign contributions to the right congresspeople, it probably doesn't have a prayer of getting out the gate.

Build a bitcoin locker into a handgun and see if you can co-opt the second amendment folks into supporting cryptocurrency.

And taxes. Until the IRS takes BTC, there will be a use case for USD. Sigh.
