People talk about things. It becomes disingenuous when a discussion is painted as vested interest. 
Commenting doesn’t equate support. Just awareness. Like how I am commenting on bitcoin but I have no interest in participating in it.

Great question! I wouldn’t know that percentage but I’d imagine the answer to be = (number of people who bought into bitcoin/total subscribers) x 100%

Two different scales no less!
Yo bro I bet if you zoomed far enough into the nasdaq index you can find a perfect match to your bitcoin trend. Why didn’t you?

Why not sell dollars for food since buying bitcoin isn’t the crux of the motivation here.
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:58:08
And they’ll sell the moment they get into the black
