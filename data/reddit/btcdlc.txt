It might not be enough to entice some people. But we're just trying to gain some exposure for a free app. It might attract some attention :)

Hi! Yeah, sorry, that part isn't clear.
The idea is that vendors would make their own shops and advertise them ... but it might be a good idea to also list them somewhere on the app as well.
EDIT: Still experimenting, but for now, the most recent updates are being listed and so is a collection of all shops. It may be the case that some sellers will want to opt out of being listed on the front page ... so this behavior might change, or might be configurable. It's a work in progress.

At the moment, we don't really have the resources to develop against other providers. But if we *were* to pick one, the next logical choice would probably be Google Drive. What do you think?

The information is there in the back end, because the app has to send out download links, so that's a feature that is possible ... just haven't gotten there yet :)
Thank you! I'm really happy with all the suggestions and feedback.

Thank you!

There is a terms of service and a privacy policy on the application ... and I will respond to any legitimate takedown notice, for sure.
The app is self-service, so I have to rely on bad content being reported or just getting lucky and catching it. But I definitely agree.
As far as payment, because I want vendors to get their money right away and because I don't want the app to become a target for hackers, I try to pay out every single sale. The only issue is if the proceeds from the sale are *smaller* than the miner fee (so anything less than or equal to 0.0001 BTC), I can't really send out anything since every transaction pays the fee. For the time being, I'm just keeping track of all the dust accumulating (and it gets listed on your vendor account). Hopefully when the new client comes out and has more straightforward transaction fee rules (they're [a complex mess]( right now!) then I can offer a way to "sweep" out the dust.
But most transactions luckily will just get paid out automatically because I imagine most prices are going to be above 0.0001 ...
Sorry that was long-winded. I've thought about this a lot and this is the *current* solution. It can be improved :)

You can actually use Dropbox completely from a web interface if you like. Admittedly, the desktop interface is more convenient, but the web interface allows you to upload and download content as well.

That's cool. Thanks for pointing it out! The more the merrier.
BTCDLC is meant for ease of use (just hook up your Dropbox) and to be free (no commissions). Also, buyers don't need to create accounts.
As an aside, any Bitcoin related site probably ought to be served over HTTPS ;-)

Good plan; on it! It's totally gonna work. Here's a strategy: just give it away for free :)
Here's mine: [BTCDLC](
You can go launch your own Bitcoin shop to sell things you made right off your Dropbox (did I mention it's free)?
Sorry for shilling. Well, only a little sorry.

Not sure ... perhaps a mod removed it? It didn't appear to violate the community rules in the sidebar.
@_date: 2014-08-26 03:02:06
Thanks very much! Good luck :-)

We built a refund system for files that are *unavailable* on BTCDLC (i.e. cannot be delivered or the seller removed them after the purchase was made but before the sale was confirmed/delivered) ... but you're right, if the actual content is just plain bad, it's really going to come down the reputation of the individual vendor.
@_date: 2014-08-26 04:39:47
Thank you so much for the feedback and suggestions!
That's definitely something worth thinking about (or maybe just special-casing pay what you want orders). I'll look into it!
EDIT: Also thanks for the tip :D

Well, being unaffiliated with Dropbox, I can't really comment about what their privacy policy is and about their attitudes (obviously). But as far as features and ease of use, it definitely was kind of the obvious choice for an app like ours because it has really wide adoption.
Either way, though, if you aren't comfortable using their service, that's obviously a personal decision that only you can make. Thank you so much for the feedback, though. It's very much appreciated :)

You're actually allowed to have lower prices if you like, that warning is there to tell you about dust.
Every pay-out includes the suggested default transaction fee (currently 0.0001) anyway just because the app wants to play nice with miners.
As far as listing shops, that's a good idea, but it might be the case that more data is necessary (like is this shop NSFW, etc.) before listing it on the front page. It's definitely of a problem either way, it's just that the solution isn't obvious ... yet :)
