Mainstream media doesn't know anything about any field. What they say comes from what they heard and feelings. It can seem weird but a good majority of the population doesn't know the difference between algorithm and logarithm, how much do you think they could understand about something like BTC?

It's all speculation but once we make the next step, be it nuclear fusion or whatever it is, we won't have twice or thrice as much energy, we'll have a 100 times more, pollution won't be halved, it'll be 0, costs will become negligible etc. And we have no reason to think this won't be the case at the moment.

All those coinbase posts of late are seriously scaring me. I was thinking of switching to an electrum wallet, do you think coinbase is safe if I'm just buying Btc on it and then moving it somewhere safer?
Edit: guys I appreciate the responses but you're saying something that has nothing to do with my question as far as I can tell. What I'm wondering is whether coinbase is fine if I'm only using it to buy and then moving stuff somewhere else, I know it's not a good place to keep BTC long term.

Ahah I was a bit frustrated but I didn't want to sound ungrateful towards people trying to give me advice. I bought quite a bit of time ago but I've kept it on coinbase thinking it was a good idea.  
I found electrum suggested in the sidebar so I thought it'd be a better idea to keep the BTC there.
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:47:07
Holy baby Jesus I missed the bottom.
Normal people have FOMO but I have FOFOMO, not buying because I'm scared I'm just afraid of missing out and buying impulsively.

So let's say I invested 200$ in Bitcoin at 15k. I now have much less of that, but if I hadn't invested those 200$ would've been spent in gin tonics this Christmas, so I in fact have more money than I would've had without investing.
It's all a matter of perspective.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:45:11
Yep but that doesn't matter because it's made up. You might be interested in knowing that every single story and saying only happens to be true 50% of the time at best, they're not designed to be wise, they're designed to have a good sound and state the obvious after it's already happened.

There's no such thing as cheap or expensive, like there is no small or big, everything can only be described compared to something else.
Compared to my income bitcoin is pretty fucking huge, compared to Apple it's pretty fucking small, even though price doesn't mean much without growth, like speed has little use without acceleration.
