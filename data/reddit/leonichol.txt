Was the spelling. We say fibre. And Ma/Mam/Mum.

The UK subs are also a reflection of this. Said subs are generally a higher quality of moderation and user than the big US-based ones. Go to so much as mention it, and you will be downvoted. Then you will get the token Redditor ready to argue, who doesn't have the foggiest but is willing to take a shot at you anyway.
Massive resistance.

Yeah you interpreted the brackets slightly incorrectly. What it means is, the tax due needs to be calculated to its GBP value for when it occurred.
So for example, if a customer bought a graphics card now, and the price plummets 5 months from now, you have to use the BTC to GBP value of March (now) rather than August.

Any chance they can change their webfont?
Whitney renders horribly on both my Linux and Windows systems.

They're having widespread issues with the SMS system apparently. They're working on a fix atm.

Stumped at the first hurdle.
Sent SMS verification code which was never received... no way to request a resend or change the number.

Refit an Amazon Kindle into a 3G modem.
Slow as hell and can't push much through it... but hey, it's free. At least until they cut you off.

You will never pull this through Amazon's systems. Trust me, it is throttled extremely tightly. You can download from its own servers at full 3G speed, but not from anything upstream (which in this context, is the entire internet).


Sure. Provided you could get port access and encapsulate your requests in HTTP, and use less than 50MB. It's close, but not quite.
Also, person never mentioned bitcoin data.

You wouldn't.
But that isn't what the person I was responding too was asking.

Cool story bro.
Now tell me, the 3G worldwide kindle service which operates through a proxy, what can you actually pull, realistically, from non-Amazon sites.
Yeah. Not quite 2Mbit, is it. Therefore likely not what the poster I was responding too was quite hoping for.
