No one is going to have any money from tax returns because they were good children and claimed capital gain on their crypto and now they have to pay tax on it :(
Yes, I am aware not all countries force their citizens to pay capital gain or report crypto earnings....

How do you know it's organic growth? It could just be testing support... be careful RIMS.

I'm watching the entire market cap shed 20 billion dollars in a matter of hours knowing that, in part, this is because there are clueless traders who are watching self-acclaimed Youtube "Pros" and subsequently panic selling. The cryptocurrency market is so volatile (given that anyone can login to an exchange and make trades).
More inexperienced traders need to realize that big money is going to come in to take their money (after all, these "pros" are only in Crypto to make money). There's all this sentiment in the market about "holding" or "watching the charts" or "trusting the technical instruments". Fundamentally someone is getting richer ergo someone is getting poorer.
It's like taking candy from a baby.
Also, I have nothing against holding per se, but damn this market is cray.

I think it's less 'lost interest' and more 'afraid or weary of such a volatile asset which is begging to be put under the thumb of governments'

I think the real "problem" with Bakkt is that there's not as much activity as people hoped/predicted. I would guess that, in time, it will be more active. Baby steps I suppose. So not really a problem. People are just impatient.

And there are other blockchains too with high TPS (Dash, Monero, Cardano, etc)

Fair enough.

I think the bottom is around $2500 or $2800 USD  
EDIT: this is not financial advice. This is based on TA of other people who have made some decent calls in the past that I follow. Can I be wrong? Absolutely. Will I be right? Who knows. Will I be wrong? Who knows.

I don't think even another world war would result in an internet meltdown. The internet is too global to fail and used by far too many people. I know things (big things) can fail, but at this point in human history, it's not even worth our time to try to imagine a world without the internet. (IMHO)

Yeah. Cheers to this guy/gal.
Some days it bothers me that it's not backed by something physical. But the fundamental structure of a blockchain and the finite amount really helps, that's for sure. I've been reading lots of overly positive and overly negative posts on Reddit all day. I could care less. Pick a position and stick with it. I'm just going to hold my crypto (BTC &amp; Alts). It's money I can afford to loose at the end of the day.
EDIT:  "1 BTC = 1 BTC".... I smell a doge in here. Woof.
