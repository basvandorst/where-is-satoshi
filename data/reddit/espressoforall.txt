Now...I don't understand capital controls very well, but if all the Greek banks are closed, how exactly would that work

I just poked around the API portion of your site and I guess some of the addresses per transaction are posted, I'm just not technically sophisticated enough to refute or confirm whether this information is sufficient to really deter everyone but the fools. 
Anyways, thanks for responding.

Yea, it seems excessive to have to upload my drivers license every time

Wouldn't blockchain difficulty decrease for those remaining on the old blockchain? 
It can (and has) decreased as miners/pools have gone offline in the past, right?

I've read some 'horror stories', and read some 'successes'...what's the general verdict on this group? Economically it doesn't make sense for folks to unload stuff at a 20% discount unless it's 
a) stolen funds or 
b) ...something

No, I don't think there is. But I do think there needs to be a limit at some point, where serious criminal concerns are involved - maybe that line isn't drug proceeds, maybe it's arms-trafficking, or uranium centrifuges or something. 
Obviously government wants perfect visibility on all transactions, and that's not right. But perfect anonymity doesn't seem right either -- and I know that's not a popular position for here. I just don't know where the line should be drawn within reason.
