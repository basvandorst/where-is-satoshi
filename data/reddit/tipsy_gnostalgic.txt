Think of it more like editing, just like an editor trims down purple prose in an author's novel and leaves the quality content behind

you are not even answering his question. OP is asking why should he invest in BTC, he wants to know why should he use BTC as currency when it is prone so such sudden price changes. It seems like a majority of users on the sub love to talk about how amazing BTC is and how it will be used over other currencies, but these people fail to address Bitcoin's volatility which makes it horrible from a consumer standpoint. Anyone who brings this point up tends to either get downvoted to oblivion (out of sight out of mind amirite?) or just handwaved away being told something about "longterm value".
Bitcoin may have advantages over traditional currency but without stability consumers will be too afraid to enter the market (which you kind of need if you want your currency to be actually used for a purpose other than arbitrage).

You make many valid arguments and it seems like you spent quite a while typing your response up, so I commend you for that. However I still feel that there are a few points which you did not address.
One of your standards for a desirable currency is it being "widely accepted", but this currently seems like the opposite situation for BTC. There is no reputable group that backs up bitcoin, and if you asked 100 random people if they knew about BTC, only 2 or 3 might have heard of it (with even less users). The only widespread uses of BTC I am currently aware of are: using it as donations to organizations without access to payment services like paypal (wikileaks), and payment on the infamous SilkRoad. Everyone else seems to be speculators, with a few other people using it for niche online services. The types of products which can be bought using BTC pale in comparison to cash (whether it be online or in real life). If I tried to buy groceries and used BTC as payment, I would get laughed at right before they kick me out of the store. 
Another issue which you failed to mention was volatility. Yes we have all heard the argument about how the US dollar is horrible because of inflation, but at least it has government backing, and remains relatively stable in price for day to day trading. Compare this to the value of BTC which rapidly fluctuates *daily*, and has a price which has nearly tripled in the past month. With this much price variation I can't see any businesses accepting BTC; what happens when the product you bought at 2 BTC is worth half that by next week? 
One last problem I want to highlight is ease of access (or the lack of it). Let's say I want to donate to some random blogger or one of my favorite imageboards which needs money, so I must somehow obtain Bitcoins. After researching BTC and figuring out how it works, I have to download a wallet service. Before I can even send funds out of my wallet I have to wait for it to synchronize with the blockchain, a process which takes several hours at best. Then I have to buy the actual bitcoins from somewhere like Mt.Gox, which has to be funded by a bank transfer (which my bank charges me for) or some other service like Dwolla which also will charge me. Either way I am waiting days for Mt.Gox to receive my funds, and then they will charge me *more* commission for buying BTC. You get the idea. Just typing up the entire process of obtaining Bitcoins is tedious. If it takes this much effort for Joe Blow to get BTC, what motivation is there for him to use it as a currency. Bitcoins may not be trapped by physical means but there are still limitations to the usage of it.

Banning image macros is censorship. You know who else used censorship? Hitler. By banning image macros you are literally Hitler.

[I can also find a graph where the price remained stable for 6 months](
So yes, back then there may have been days with higher percentage movement (which would be seen when the price of BTC was substantially lower), however the general trend was relatively stable meaning consumers were less likely to get burned, and if they did they could just wait out a price correction.
[Compare that to a recent graph.] (
Unfortunately I don't have much more time so I'll try to cut to the main point of my argument. Yes there may have been some periods where volatility was high (and some where it wasn't) but recent events brought unseen levels of publicity and volatility. To me, it seems unnecessarily risky right now to buy BTC when the price is so unpredictable, which is the problem OP is addressing.  
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:30:01
relative is the key word here. Compared to the rapid price changes now, BTC was stable in the past, or at least stable enough to use for micro transactions.
Obviously if you buy $100k bitcoins then you will be far more effected by price fluctuations than if you only buy $100 worth. The average consumer has no use for this amount of BTC so I am not sure why you are using this number when it is not realistic. When a consumer bought into BTC they would maybe buy anywhere from 1-10 and the overall value in a week might have fluctuated by a few dollars but there were no sudden drastic price changes.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:00:58
It is relevant because we are talking about consumers not speculators. Unless people are using Bitcoin to make a down-payment for a house, I don't see why a consumer would need "thousands of dollars" equivalent in BTC.
Yes it was true that the price in the past might have changed 10 or 20% in a single day (these are just rough guestimates I don't have the time right now to go hunting for graphs) but in the longterm the price was relatively static. This meant that if you held on to your BTC long enough, then there would be a price correction and you would generally see the value return close to original price. In today's situation we have rapid rises and crashes, in addition to an unpredictable market, making it a risky time for consumers to enter. When volatility is concerned you don't just look at a single days losses/gains but also the general trend of the price, and seeing if the price stays close to a certain value (which it did in the past).

wow why would you send some random guy 1 BTC...
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:41:25
I am astounded by all the posts of people who dropped $1000+ and bought in at 160 or higher. Did they really think it would only go up?
@_date: 2013-03-04 11:58:14
heh heh. Sorta like the classic argument "only a few people are using e-mail, why would anyone want to use it?"
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:41:05
You are right in that everyone should be entitled to state their opinion (free speech and all that) but that doesn't mean everyone should be able to post anything anywhere. If people started posting irrelevant information  or illegal content the mods would not hesitate to remove it. Likewise mods should remove low-brow content which serves no purpose except to karmawhore. There are subs dedicated to humor and memes, this isn't one of them.

Thanks for the fast responses. You presented plenty of long-term solutions for Bitcoin (which is great) but in the end they are just ifs. Until these problems are resolved I think it is too early to call Bitcoin "the best currency humans have ever used". However, it certainly does have the potential to become the best sometime in the future.
I would continue the discussion but it is very late where I am at :p
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:11:02
This is true. It would be hard to run a business when you lose all of your profits in a day due to a single day's price fluctuations.
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:25:04
As you say, I may be mathematically wrong, but it still proves the main point doesn't it? Bitcoin is still too volatile to be used on a widespread basis by consumers and business owners, it is only used on SilkRoad because of the freedom and anonymity that it grants. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:56:37
What makes you assume that? Yes there was a previous rise and crash but for the majority of bitcoin's history the price has remained relatively stable. Most days it was rare to see the price change by $5 or more. I don't see why people should currently use BTC as a currency when the price has fluctuated by $30 just this past week.
@_date: 2013-03-04 05:35:42
bitcoins certainly is innovative, but claiming it is the "most perfect form of money that humankind has ever created" seems to be stretching it a bit. Along with many of your other exaggerations.
@_date: 2013-03-04 05:26:48
If you do invest in something, make sure you diversify...putting $1k into one thing (especially bitcoin) is very risky. Especially when you are buying in at a relatively high price.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:20:31
you shouldn't. In the past it wasn't this volatile until the recent bubble arose. Now a large portion of users are using BTC for speculation which accounts for all the rapid rises/panic crashes.

Oh but irrelevant information gets upvoted all the time.
