Perhaps the best thing to do is to contribute to btcpayserver as it has most of these features already. Just a plug-in NFC device would make it a complete Bitcoin+LN solution.
@_date: 2014-09-10 15:24:31
This is what I was hoping for. I followed the announcement and check developer site today. Nothing about actual NFC API. Very disappointed.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:11:22
That's exactly our view as well. We have a local point of sale app and heard from enthusiastic merchants looking to try it when mainnet is available. If we fail it'll be on us not lightning devs.

Here's an app on Play Store that lets you generate payment requests on Bitcoin testnet: 
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:31:27
Other than merchant writing their BTC address into the passive RFID tag, what's the use case for these?
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:39:03
I'm not an expert on NFC either but you're right, instead of sending data over the visual spectrum, you send the same data over RF. So only the transport network changes. And since all of the actual transaction happens on the Lightning network where your bitcoins are locked inside a bidirectional channel. I don't see any basic security issue.
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:15:26
I'm working on an app right now that uses Lightning backend.
So far I can generate invoices and display QR code on screen or share payment link so anyone can pay with their lightning enabled wallet.

SS7 is the inter-networking protocol used between mobile network operators. Since it was developed ages ago it has a lot of security holes. This is well known and exploited by NSA and pals. All you need is declaring yourself as a mobile network operator and making some roaming agreements :)
There are some cool stuff you can do using the system via sms (remember cool little java applets written to hijack the phone?) but this is still a few systems away from actually accessing a bitcoin wallet app. On modern operating systems like iOS and Android, these are seperate systems.

I feel your pain. 
I spent last few months trying to track my regular payments because visa decided to cancel my credit card's online payment feature. I didn't get a call, email, nothing. I figured it out after I started getting late notices on my regular online bills like domain registrar and cloud services etc. I called my bank to see what happened, they said "they can't really see any details" just that visa thinks my credit card is in some shady hands and they closed it to online purchases. There's nothing you can do except pay for a new credit card. I'm supposed to pay extra because of their poor security design. 
we have something better and it's coming for their subpar technology and service.
@_date: 2019-03-20 16:31:34
Even if I didn't have to pay, it's still major inconvenience placed upon me for their fault. It may be a silly first world problem but still I am not happy about it.

this is very exciting. I'm trying to figure out exact costs of using loop right now, but more importantly:

They can see only the amount only if they are your only LSP. Plus they won't know the start/end point of payments thanks to onion routing.

Rod node = wallet node, which breez calls LSP (Lightning Service provider) so they know you already because they open a channel to you on initial download. I'm guessing the QR code that people will scan to send you an offline payment will have routing hints with rod node in it.

opennode has very easy integration with woocommerce and you can even generate invoices from the website. You can also connect to your bank account and cash out with fiat. Definitely recommended.

Blw backs up the bitcoin wallet and Lightning channel state as well.

Sat2.io does this on Lightning.
Bottle.li does it on LN for nearly all social media. 
They're custodial.
1 cool thing bottle does is use hodl invoices which allows them to hold an invoice for 1 week and wait for user to claim their account. if they don't, they return the bitcoin to sender.

Well, you wouldn't hold a large pile of bull crap if it wasn't useful to you so you shouldn't aspire to hold bunch of shitcoins either. But if it's just for educational purposes I guess you can try dogecoin. You can mine very few coins with personal cpu and even gpu.

All feedback or better ideas welcome.
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:27:37
exactly. Lightning is a 2nd Layer protocol on top of the bitcoin blockchain. It's made of payment channels, like internet is made of links. Payments are routed from channel to channel over lightning nodes. No block time to wait for, no limit to Transaction per Second.
more info and a lot of resources: [
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:50:28
I wonder if I can use this to send satoshis back and forth between this and other tipping services like tippin.me and even Bitcoin microtask website like ask.for-bitcoin.com.
Let the LN routing begin :)
@_date: 2018-12-22 06:06:33
I did the same for a few projects I'm working on but then you need two nodes, 1 for testnet. You need some scripts for withdrawal, ensure liquidity, channel reach etc. In the end it was just easier to use strike/opennode.

You have got to stop saying that. There are a lot of intermediaries and there are appropriate use cases for some of them. A simple Rest API backend for anyone wanting to accept LN right away is one use case, bluewallet with lndhub is another one. LN is small amounts and you can withdraw anytime.
