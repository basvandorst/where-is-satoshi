I haven't given on that scale, but for two of the charities I give to monthly, I've switched to giving Bitcoin instead. It's good to be the first donor to give Bitcoin to organizations I care about. I hope Bitcoin goes to $1M/BTC and makes them ridiculously rich.
It's also nice to be able to use Bitcoin for something that doesn't incur capital gains tax.

Just so you know: Bitfloor is registered with FinCEN as well. Be advised that this does not mean that FinCEN has vetted the company in any way, and it does not confer any guarantees to customers regarding the registered company.
In addition, as we've seen with Bitfloor, FinCEN-registered status did nothing to protect Bitfloor from their bank unilaterally closing their checking account, effectively freezing all customers' USD balances.

This is a gift from the feds to Bitcoin. It creates an even greater incentive for Bitcoin miners and merchants to keep storing and spending their Bitcoins in the Bitcoin economy. Who wants to trade their Bitcoins for fiat if that instantly exposes you to additional regulation?

Yes, after thinking about this some more, I can see that the credit union model seems a lot more philosophically aligned with the Bitcoin community than a federal- or state-chartered bank.

Seriously, Roman, if you're reading this, the above comment seems like the right start.
I think most of your customers (me included) understand that you're in a tough spot right now, and that the banks have a great deal of power to tie your hands.
But you do have the power to broadcast your communication, through your website, twitter, reddit, etc. No one expects you to be everywhere, in every forum, answering everyone's questions all the time. But using your broadcast channels effectively is what reasonable customers are going to expect you to do, to demonstrate that you have their best interests in mind.
It's not too late to rebuild trust. I don't know who else is on your team, but if you're overwhelmed trying to manage this situation, consider reaching out to the community for help. There might be a great PR person, community manager, legal counsel, etc. in the Bitcoin community who would like to see this situation resolved as much as you and your customers do. There might be a creative way to crowdsource your damage control. If you have a playbook of information you'd like communicated in the forums, for example, you could brief some volunteers who can be on the lookout for concerned customers' questions, and those volunteers would then be armed to spread correct information, rather than fueling rumors or speculation. That way you don't have to be everywhere at once.
There might still be a silver lining in this story.

**Update 25-July-2013: My full refund (over $3,000) posted to my IAFCU account today.**
**tl;dr** Got my IAFCU account number after one week. Credit union volunteers are working around the clock to process new account applications. Please be nice to them and thank them.
I applied to open a new IAFCU account last Saturday (July 6th). I knew from talking with Jordan Modell at IAFCU that the credit union was swamped with new account applications, so I expected to wait several days for my Know-Your-Customer verification call.
I didn't actually receive the call. Instead, this morning, I received the following email from msr










I knew from the automated email I received after submitting my account application that this email was supposed to accompany the KYC call, and that the password was supposed to expire relatively quickly, so I went ahead and called the credit union (848 202-9292). A volunteer answered the phone, confirmed my name and address, provided my 5-digit account number, and walked me through the process of logging into my account for the first time and changing my password.
A few minutes later, after poking around the IAFCU account management website, I logged into Bitfloor and filled out the form on the refund page by uploading my ID, entering my name and contact info, and entering my IAFCU account number. The IAFCU routing number I entered was 021283961.
Status message on Bitfloor for me is now:


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For anyone still awaiting their account number from IAFCU: Please be patient and courteous with EVERYONE you may interact with at IAFCU. Remember that they are the heroes in this Bitfloor mess. They were the only financial institution willing to take the risk of working with a Bitcoin business, and they are incurring expenses opening these accounts for everyone. They won't make a penny from the majority of these accounts, since a lot of Bitfloor users will probably just withdraw their refunds and never use the credit union again. (Although I hope some of us will actually use IAFCU for the long run because of their awesome mission, which you can learn more about from [this video of their talk at Bitcoin 2013](

But if purchasing an Amazon gift card is a taxable capital gain, wouldn't you also have to pay capital gains if, say, you went on a vacation to Europe, bought euros at $1.20/euro at the start of the trip, and then the euro goes to $1.25 and you buy something with your $1.25-worth euro?
Edit: I added a note at the top of the original post to clarify the question. That central question, I think, is this: if you buy a good or service with the Bitcoins after they have appreciated in value — without converting back to fiat — do you actually have a taxable event?

I hope everyone knows that, if and when everyone has their money safely returned, it's the Internet Credit Union that will deserve the credit. They are taking a proactive pro-Bitcoin stance, putting their money where their mouth is when they say financial institutions don't need to suck.
Credit unions may have a critical role to play providing fiat liquidity and other banking services in the Bitcoin ecosystem, especially if traditional banks continue refusing service to Bitcoin businesses. ICU is taking a risk by being a first mover in this space and working to help Bitfloor.
My biggest takeaway from my Bitfloor experience? ICU rocks. I've been meaning to join a credit union for a long time for philosophical reasons, and now I am going to stop procrastinating and do it because ICU and Jordan Modell are great people with a great vision of what banking can be.

[Edit: By popular demand, I have created a subreddit for this project — — Subscribe!]
All joking aside ...
**How:** Step 1. Seek out like-minded people to get a conversation going. Through conversation, find a team that is a.) capable of wa-a-ay out of the box thinking and possessed of a good sense of humor, b.) compatible for a long-term working relationship, and c.) competent enough to identify, obtain, and/or master the knowledge/skills/tools/funding required to build an independent sovereign nation. Step 2 ... TBD by said team.
**Where:** The Seasteading Institute, the Bitcoin 2013 conference, and I all happen to be located in the Bay Area, so I'd be doing my bit from here for the near future, since it feels like this place is a nexus for my fringe interests. But it's highly unlikely that all the right people for such an endeavor are located in a 10-mile radius of my house, so the project would need to be conducted in a location-agnostic way whenever possible.
**When:** Begin now, with the expectation that ultimate success will probably require an ongoing, decades-long endeavor by many people spread out across the globe who are doing this initially as a side project to their normal life's work. I'd like to think this is an in-my-lifetime achievable goal, but I'm open to it being more than that. Think Millenium Project timescales.

Maybe a dumb question, but does anyone know if the risk of keeping fiat balances at MtGox is higher or lower relative to the risk of keeping BTC balances there? I'm assuming it's more difficult for hackers to transfer out fiat from your account than it would be for them to send BTC out of your account, since the receiving account for fiat would be subject to more stringent identity verification than a receiving BTC address.
@_date: 2013-07-19 00:25:40
Other users on [this thread]( with balances under $3,000 have reported being able to _initiate_ their refund request (in other words, they submitted it without a server error, but they're still waiting on the refund itself).
I'll add the server error issue to the list of problems I'm monitoring. I don't know if Bitfloor is working on this or not, but I know several people have emailed and tweeted them about it.
Edit: Forgot to link to the thread I was talking about.

Several people were able to get their BTC out in the hours after the shutdown announcement was made, and if I remember correctly a few other people reported that they had BTC transfers out of their accounts that finally entered the blockchain days later.

I agree that seasteading is not a requirement for a free society. My main interest in it is that it provides an opportunity for experimentation with alternative forms of human organization outside the jurisdiction of existing nations (and as a bonus requires the development of really interesting marine technologies for housing, agriculture, power generation, etc.).
Although there are great technological hurdles to seasteading, and a non-negligible possibility of hostile response from powerful nations causing the overthrow of a burgeoning seasteading nation, the creation of a new nation that doesn't require the overthrow of an existing government is very appealing to me.
Also, living on a floating island would be awesome.

Yes, but the problem is that most people who want to use Bitcoin have to first acquire bitcoins with fiat. And the exchanges who help people acquire bitcoins with their fiat are getting shut down because the exchanges' bank accounts are getting unilaterally closed. So creating a bank or credit union to serve Bitcoin businesses could help solve this problem, because a bank or credit union that's focused on following all the applicable regulations — and making sure its clients follow applicable regulations — will help prevent account closures. Bitcoin-friendly fiat institutions are a big missing piece in the Bitcoin ecosystem right now.

Has anyone been actively marketing Bitcoin as a democratic currency? I was never under the impression that Bitcoin's decentralization was intended to produce a democracy.

And CoinLab's supposed concern for US and Canadian Bitcoin users is laughable, as you say. No way will a lawsuit — or even the threat of one — over this matter improve service to any users, anywhere.

TL;DR: "If you have a gain on a personal foreign currency transaction because of changes in exchange rates, you do not have to include that gain in your income unless it is more than $200. If the gain is more than $200, report it as a capital gain." — IRS website

Someone I met at the SF Bitcoin meetup on Tuesday was (I think — I could have been misunderstanding) trying to explain to me that dark pools will enable high-frequency trading because they support price discovery in fractions of a second, which will therefore increase price volatility. That person's overall impression seemed to be that Tradehill's relaunch was going to be a net negative for the Bitcoin community.
Based on the description of dark pools in this article, I don't understand the tie-in to high-frequency trading.

I do have this issue on my radar; it has been reported to me by at least one other non-US Bitfloor users.
Because Bitfloor just announced the refund process yesterday, I am asking everyone to give Bitfloor one more week (until 7/12) to start working through their backlog of customer support emails (there must be hundreds, if not thousands, by now). If by that time they haven't corrected the SWIFT bug, or if you have otherwise been unable to submit your withdrawal request, please ping me again. I will start using the update email list at that point to monitor a "master list" of issues reported to me by customers who are having trouble initiating their refunds, and to report answers to those issues as I hear of them.

Banks or credit unions that have gone through the chartering process could still be subject to closure if they fail to comply with the law, but successfully completing the chartering process requires that the institution prove to the chartering authority (state or federal) that (among other things) they know and are able to comply with the law. This should mean that the difficulty of the government shutting down an already chartered bank or CU is much higher than the difficulty of an existing bank or CU simply closing a customer account.
This wouldn't prevent a bank or CU from having an obligation to shut down customer accounts that are failing to comply with AML laws or other applicable laws, but such a bank or CU would have a much higher motivation to work with its customers to prevent this from happening.

Any smart PR people in the audience should really start pitching their services hard to Bitfloor, MtGox, BFL, etc. So much customer anger could be alleviated and so much credibility and goodwill preserved by even the most primitive attempts at customer service and communication.
There's so much desire within the Bitcoin community to support secondary exchanges, and previously a lot of goodwill toward Bitfloor and Roman ... I can't help but think that a lot of Bitfloor customers feeling burned right now would have been willing to give them the benefit of the doubt if the communication had been better along the way.

I agree, but if I were a forward-thinking banker, I might see that difficulty as a major business opportunity. If it's hard for would-be Bitcoin businesses to get started because of regulatory issues, the services of a bank with an army of lawyers and business account managers equipped to help them navigate these issues could be quite in demand.
The bank's business model and fees would be premised on the assumption that they need to cover more legal costs (and possibly lobbyists) in order to serve the target clientele.
@_date: 2013-05-05 19:50:53
This comment on the bitcointalk thread helped me understand that there's a bit more nuance here than the title of this reddit post suggests. If I am understanding correctly, it's not that the blockchain won't accept microtransactions. It is a change to the default behavior of Bitcoin-Qt that will block the Bitcoin-Qt client from broadcasting microtransactions. It will still be possible for businesses needing microtransactions to work around this limitation.

An excellent point regarding bankroll. Working here in startup land, I tend to think of this as a startup project. So I imagine that perfecting the pitch and getting a good team together is the starting point, rather than raising money first. Personally, I'm a fan of the bootstrapping approach when it comes to startups, so my inclination would be to start under our own steam and do what we can with our own resources first, then try to leverage small-scale success and initial credibility into future funding, as needed. Strategizing for funding before there's even an inkling of a half-baked idea is not how I'd try to start.
(I also agree that a land-based intermediate step sounds wise.)

Yes, there are a few others still waiting — I've heard from some other users in both the &gt;$3,000 and the &lt;$3,000 groups who haven't had their refunds processed yet. I'd suggest tweeting  and emailing Bitfloor support to get their attention. I expect the bulk of USD refunds have been processed now, so it may be easier for you to get their attention.
@_date: 2013-05-05 23:13:38
I have not spoken to a lawyer yet and so can't speak to this for sure, but I imagine the bitcoin theft would be best handled as a separate case. The discovery process for that would be different, since it's harder to establish a paper trail for bitcoins, and Bitfloor probably didn't have insurance to cover the loss.
In the case of the USD balances, Bitfloor's website claims all funds were held in US banks in FDIC-insured accounts, which hopefully will provide some recourse if there is actually any theft involved. It would also be much harder for Bitfloor to abscond with dollars without leaving a paper trail.
Of course, if there is something going on in the background that we don't know about, such as investigation into Bitfloor for illegal activities, I have no idea where that would leave our funds, and whether FDIC protections would even apply.
Lawyers in the audience might be able to respond with better information.

I have had to explain the difference between the blockchain and Blockchain.info to so many newcomers. It's possibly worse than the confusion newcomers have due to Bitcoin being used to refer variously to an address balance, a protocol, a network, etc.

I think you're still missing the nuance here — once your fiat has been converted to Bitcoin, you can buy stuff with the Bitcoin without converting it back to fiat. Capital gains definitely applies if you buy stock, or a house, or gold, with fiat and *then sell the stock/house/gold again for fiat*. But if you never sell the Bitcoin for fiat again, is it a taxable event?
If it is a taxable event, then essentially *everyone* who's currently buying stuff for Bitcoins needs to be paying capital gains.

Certainly any bank or credit union specializing in Bitcoin customers will need to comply with applicable laws. However, an institution specializing in Bitcoin businesses could focus on creating and communicating clear guidelines for its clients to help them avoid account closures due to AML regulations.
In the case of the Bitfloor account closure, for example, it seems (although Bitfloor has provided very few details) that Capitalone Bank provided almost zero notice before closing the account. This happened despite Bitfloor's apparent attempts to conform to all applicable laws, including registering with FinCEN as a money services business in the US. If Capitalone had provided guidelines to Bitfloor about what they should do to avoid account closure, I'd bet Bitfloor would have made an effort to comply. But Bitfloor wasn't even given the chance — the bank just pre-emptively closed their account.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:33:32


One of the great innovations of Bitcoin, though, is that users don't need to judge the *quality* of anything. They just need to be able to count. So you don't need a centralized third party to judge the quality for you. Just look up your addresses on the blockchain, add their balances together, and presto!


Another great innovation of Bitcoin is that you don't need a centralized mint. Everyone agrees upon the rules by which coins are "minted" (i.e. mined), and everyone is freely allowed to join the minting party.


Having your currency implicitly support war and taxes is a bug, not a feature. Fortunately, Bitcoin does not have this bug.

A bank or CU would only be a single point of failure if every Bitcoin exchange decided to keep its fiat accounts with the same bank or CU. Short of that, having a Bitcoin-focused financial institution would not be a single point of failure — it would increase redundancy of fiat account options beyond existing banks, making the ecosystem more resilient overall.

To clarify: so you hadn't logged in to Bitfloor since April 17th (when the shutdown occurred), but you sent BTC to an address that had been associated with your account prior to that date?
If so, this probably means you will be stuck with the rest of Bitfloor's users who are waiting on Bitcoin refunds. I have asked Roman and John why BTC refunds are being delayed, since one would think this should be independent of USD delays, but I haven't heard an answer yet. If I do hear back any information on the USD or BTC side, I'll include it in a future update.

The SmartMoney.com article mentions [Nubank]( who specializes in helping new banks through the chartering process. Presumably a would-be bank founder could leverage their expertise to help get through that chartering process.

According to customers who have contacted me, some BTC withdrawals requested in the days after the shutdown were successful. (No USD withdrawals requested since the shutdown have been successful, to my knowledge.)

No offense taken. I think it's right for every Bitfloor user to question every bit of information that's been stated by anyone involved.
As for me: I've shared the full extent of my involvement through my update emails, which are also posted for all to read at audenx.tumblr.com. I'm just another Bitfloor user, and I want my money back. I figured there were a lot of other people in my situation, and since I was going to do as much information gathering as possible on my own, I figured I'd give others the benefit of what I've learned. I don't have any personal or professional connection with Roman, Bitfloor, or IAFCU apart from my communications with them since the exchange shut down. I've offered my help to both Roman and IAFCU if there's any way I can use my email list to broadcast correct information to users. No one associated with Bitfloor has taken me up on that offer. Jordan at IAFCU did ask me to send out the information about why the donation to a New Brunswick nonprofit is necessary to open an account with the credit union, but that's the only specific request that was made of me.
Hopefully the (admittedly incomplete) information I've been able to get from Roman and company will be helpful. Personally, I am still remaining patient, but I'm under no illusions that I have all the information required to say whether or not this is a runaround. Everyone needs to make their own decision about what legal action, if any, they want to take.
**Edit 25-July-2013 7pm PDT: My full refund (over $3,000) posted to my IAFCU account today.**

Bitfloor good news and Battlestar Galactica all on one Saturday? Awesome.
I will keep monitoring the situation to see what happens to users with pending withdrawals (I had a small pending withdrawal myself which I was using as a test case), and I'll report any info I'm receiving from users about problems with refunds. It would be great if Bitfloor has made plans for pending withdrawals to be resolved without further user action, but it wouldn't be surprising (to me) if some interaction with customer support were needed.
If I were you, I would check my Bitfloor account withdrawal page once a day for the next few business days, as well as the account balance on the account where you're expected to receive the funds. If you haven't received your funds by say Friday 7/12, shoot me a PM.
**Update:** I am already receiving emails from other users who are seeing USD balances of 0.00 on Bitfloor when they log in. So you are not the only one.

This doesn't answer your question, but just a small positive indication:
I had submitted my ID for verification on Monday (about 2.5 days before the shutdown announcement) so that I could withdraw USD from my bitfloor account, and I followed up on Wednesday before Roman's announcement to check my verification status. I haven't received any email response from bitfloor about my specific account verification status, but  did respond to me on Twitter saying verification of ID's for ACH withdrawal is backlogged beyond the 2-3 day time estimate originally cited on the site.
Anyway, the hopeful sign: When I logged into the site this morning, the withdrawal option is now unlocked for me. Up until then, it had just said to expect a 2-3 day delay while my ID was verified. I assume this means they're making their way through the manual verification process for ACH withdrawal. I initiated a small transfer of funds (didn't want to the risk the whole amount in case it gets stuck in the ether) out of bitfloor and into my bank account. Assuming that goes through, I'm hoping this means I'll have my funds back in a few banking days.
A few minutes after I initiated my withdrawal, I received an automated email alerting me that my withdrawal had been initiated. Again, I'm hoping this means the withdrawal system is working normally.
Good luck with your withdrawal. I'm sure with that large of a balance you must be sweating a bit.

Right, now we're talking about the same thing. I've been trying to get at what happens if you *never* exchange your bitcoins for dollars again.
A comment thread above seems to have answered the question, though. If Bitcoin ends up being treated like a foreign currency, you'll have to report capital gains if the exchange rate gives you a benefit of $200 or more in subsequent transactions.

reported that Bitfloor has removed all pending withdrawals, so for users who were seeing $0 balances due to pending withdrawals, check your account again to see if that's cleared up.
I believe this means pending withdrawals that were cancelled will need to be re-initiated using the instructions now appearing on your account screen when you log in to Bitfloor.

Agreed — I imagine fraud (real, alleged, and/or potential) has been a contributing factor to the account closures.
A bank or credit union focused on Bitcoin economy clients could choose to have a high standard for identity verification of new account applicants (particularly business account applicants, but consumer applicants, too) to minimize fraud risk, though. And, unlike some of the existing banks who have closed accounts without warning, a Bitcoin-friendly bank/CU could have very clear and well-communicated policies about what warrants account closure, what typical pitfalls Bitcoin businesses can encounter, and how to avoid these pitfalls.
Current financial institutions are probably treating Bitcoin businesses poorly because of some combination of the following. 1.) They are cautious about serving clients whose businesses they don't understand, and they haven't invested time yet to understand Bitcoin. 2.) They perceive Bitcoin as a competitive threat to their own business. 3.) They anticipate regulatory hassle/costs to their own business if they serve Bitcoin businesses.
A financial institution set up with a goal of fostering the Bitcoin economy through serving Bitcoin users and businesses could almost certainly do a better job than a bank whose core business interests and focus lie elsewhere.

I'm interested in establishing a timeline for Bitcoin-24 refunds to compare to the timeline since the Bitfloor account closure. Bitfloor's bank closed their account on April 17th, and communication from Bitfloor has been almost nonexistent since then. Bitfloor's lawyer has so far made just one public statement, and that was via email to the press, not to the customers. Bitfloor claims to be working to resolve the situation and claims that the funds are available to cover all customers deposits, but apparently Bitfloor has been unable to find a US bank willing to cash the check from their closed account.

From what I understand, the credit unions in the US operate similarly to what you're describing. Some credit unions specialize in consumer deposit and loan services, while other credit unions specialize in banking and infrastructure services _for_ credit unions. Could be that a network of focused CU's could be better than a single CU that tries to serve the needs of every type of virtual currency user.
I'd love to see a CU that doesn't focus on loans at all, but whose income instead comes from exchange fees, BTC escrow, and other services specific to virtual currencies. I'm not sure if that's a feasible business model, but worth looking into.
I feel like the CU's best move regarding BTC deposits would be to arm members with the understanding of how to store their coins themselves, rather than accepting BTC deposits from individuals. Insuring individual BTC deposits, if you could even get an insurance company to take on such a policy, would probably be too expensive for most small BTC holders. But I guess if users are willing to pay for it, that could be another income stream for the CU.

Pulling the plug on the war machine is in my top 3 reasons I love Bitcoin, along with:

Thanks for sharing about cruisers; I was unfamiliar with the term.
Regarding the word "project":
(Full disclosure: I'm a project manager myself, so I may be biased towards project-based thinking, and my idea of what a project is might be different from yours. Anyway ...)
I imagine you could be right that project-based thinking isn't required to seastead as an individual. But I myself enjoy the benefits of living in a larger community, and I'd love to see a large community with sophisticated technology, useful infrastructure, a thriving economy (possibly denominated entirely in Bitcoin?), and a high quality of life established outside of current political jurisdictions and open to people who'd like to opt out of some of the negative aspects of their current economic/geopolitical/ideological/whatever environment. I imagine such a community would require at least some basic coordination and organization to succeed, and I think project-based thinking, with well-defined goals, timelines, and budgets, is a great way to create coordination and organization.
I will leave it to others to discuss whether coordination and organization, decentralized or otherwise, constitute "government". I know "government" has a bad connotation in a lot of libertarian circles, so I guess I'll steer clear of the word unless it's very clearly defined.

I heard the issue of taint and mixing discussed at length at the conference, and in this context heard about "virgin coins" (coins that have never moved since they were mined) perhaps claiming a premium in the future. The idea of coin provenance determining exchange value was really interesting to me.

@_date: 2013-07-07 17:30:43
Very good question.
This may seem weird to some customers who are new to [credit unions (Wikipedia article)]( but if you've never used a credit union before, one of the first things to know is that their charters require them to have a well-defined "field of membership" that limits who is able to become a member. In the case of IAFCU, the field of membership is those who live or worship in New Brunswick, NJ. _However_, IAFCU can satisfy the field of membership requirement for those outside New Brunswick if they make a small donation to a New Brunswick-based nonprofit.
So for those who (like me) are opening an IAFCU account but reside outside of New Brunswick, here's the info you're going to receive from IAFCU when they call you (from an email exchange I had with Jordan):


Although this might seem like a hassle to some, presumably everyone who is opening a new account with IAFCU has over $3,000 to recover from Bitfloor, and the $2.50 processing fee + $5 donation is hardly a loss compared to what we were fearing might happen (e.g. 25-50% loss through a class-action lawsuit).

I definitely hear you. Having the US ban Bitcoin is not my preferred outcome. I think the Bitcoin community had best arm itself against such an outcome by building a community of educated users, intelligent advocates, kick-ass lobbyists, constitutional lawyers, and — best of all — tax-compliant Bitcoin businesses.
If all of us crazy libertarians are actually right that free currency promotes trade and economic growth, the tax revenues alone should be enough reason for the fed to back off.

Yes, working out your cold storage plan is always a good thing to do, without delay, once you get started with Bitcoin.
Just to be clear here, though — this thread is about USD funds stuck in Bitfloor, not BTC that may still be stuck in Bitfloor after the 4/17 shutdown or the BTC that were outright stolen in the theft last year. Keeping BTC off an exchange and in cold storage is usually the safest bet.
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:59:57
Ah, okay. But you'd agree with the statement that Bitcoin purchases would be considered the same way as any purchase in a foreign currency?

My understanding based on the description of the wire method on that page was that the 244084264 routing number is actually for Corp One, which is a corporate credit union and a separate entity from IAFCU. (Corporate credit union means a "credit union of credit unions", which means that the members of a corporate credit union are other credit unions. A normal credit union's members are individual people.) From what I read on that page, my understanding is that IAFCU has its own members send international wires to IAFCU's account at Corp One (using Corp One's routing number and IAFCU's account number with Corp One), and then IAFCU determines which individual's account to transfer the wired funds into by looking for that individual's IAFCU account number in the wire details field.
So instead of using Corp One's routing number, I used the routing number on the global footer of the IAFCU website.

What do you think about the idea of a credit union whose member-owners are bitcoin users and bitcoin-accepting businesses? Some possible services:
* A CU optimized for virtual currency users could utilize a peer-to-peer exchange amongst depositors (buttercoin?) and other virtual currency-focused CU's, providing a safety net of liquidity for small businesses and individuals.
* A virtual currency CU could focus on the unique regulatory issues of virtual currency users and businesses to help prevent fiat account closures.
* Member-owners could direct the CU to pool funds for dollar-cost-average acquisition of BTC from miners or larger exchanges.
* CU could provide insured BTC deposits and/or training to members in correct use of cold storage.

Ahah! Perfect. That sounds like the answer. So in the scenario above, all of your $50,000 spending would subject to capital gains, minus the $200.

That is fair. My parents happen to be exposed to a lot of libertarian money talk, due to the political leanings of a few vocal members of the extended family, so this email works for them.
But for those who want to understand not just how Bitcoin works but how money works in general ... I'm not sure I want to be responsible for onboarding them. Unfortunately, such people will probably need to resign themselves to being late adopters or else just trust what other people tell them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:56:07
If you're in the US, unfortunately, your tax preparer is incorrect. I had hopes that using my bitcoins to buy stuff would exempt me from reporting capital gains, but another redditor pointed out:


"Transaction" in this case includes not just exchanging Bitcoin for fiat, but also using Bitcoin to buy something directly, without converting back to fiat. In other words, if you realized more than $200 worth of benefit from the exchange rate when you buy something with your coins, you're technically required to report it as a capital gain —assuming you want to comply with the letter of the law, of course. Some (many?) bitcoin users may choose not to do so.

I spoke to Jordan today regarding the A2A issue. He said this is an anti-fraud measure to protect your account, but if you email or call IAFCU, they should be able to adjust the limit on a person-by-person basis.

There is already (which I don't follow closely, and which currently has few subscribers), and I suppose it could be used for this purpose. But I think that's probably a misuse of that subreddit, since it's currently being used for any seasteading news.

But if you're an exchange, for example, and you want reasonable confidence that your users' fiat funds aren't going to be unilaterally frozen (a la BTC-24 and Bitfloor), wouldn't you at least consider moving to a bank with higher fees who's willing to fight the good fight on your behalf with the bank regulators?
Sure, it could end up meaning that maintaining fiat liquidity is more expensive for Bitcoin exchanges than other types of businesses, but this might just have to be a part of doing business if you want to maintain convertibility to fiat.

Anyway, I've been looking up more contact details on Roman, Bitfloor, etc. Just basics, stuff accessible via casual search, but it's a starting point. I've got the Bitfloor answering service number and address for serving papers, and possibly his personal address and phone from the white pages. Given a few days, we can request the NYS corporate docs that contain more info on officers besides Roman. If you're actually gearing up for some legal action, we should all pool info and figure out the most economical way to hire counsel.
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:23:52
The nuance of the question is key, though.
What I'm trying to understand is: if you buy a good or service with the Bitcoins after they have appreciated in value — without converting back to fiat — do you actually have a taxable event?
As I stated in the original post, this is all hypothetical. No worries here that it's not perfectly anonymous. I wouldn't post on reddit at all if I was concerned about perfect anonymity :)

The scenario above is just a specific example of a more generalized question, which is actually important for *everyone* who's ever planning to spend their bitcoins (and not just save them).
A clearer example might be: if you buy a Bitcoin for $50, and then a month later it's worth $500, what happens if you go and spend that coin at bitcoinstore or somewhere, without converting it back to fiat? Do you have to report capital gains?
Based on the above answers, it sounds like the answer is yes. That means that the reporting requirements for Bitcoin could end up being a total pain in the  for users, once the regulation catches up to actual usage.

I hesitate to speculate on timeline and hope that Roman will provide information on that score. A tweet on his personal twitter suggests he might post an official update soon.
At any rate, Jordan invited me to follow up with him later this week, and I will do so and share what I learn with the email list. If I understand correctly, the only thing on the credit union's end that stands in the way of refunds is sorting out their obligations under "Know Your Customer" rules, and Jordan expects to have that question answered by the end of next week. If ICU doesn't have any obligations in that regard, the timeline will probably depend entirely on the process Bitfloor sets up to process refunds.

This metaphor seems right to me.
I wonder if the law (once it catches up) will agree.
I also wonder if US law will decide Bitcoin is subject to FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) reporting requirements. FATCA is a mandatory tax return filing for citizens with foreign bank accounts over $10,000. But can a Bitcoin wallet be considered a "bank account"? And if it is a bank account, can it be considered "foreign", if it's distributed across a global network of Bitcoin nodes?
My gut says no, but I'm sure the government will try to make the regulatory issues around Bitcoin a total pain to navigate, whether through FATCA or some other horribly-acronymed act.

@_date: 2013-06-06 00:56:24
I agree that bankruptcy proceedings is not a desirable outcome. I hope that what Bitfloor is doing right now is tracking down every available lead on a bank (US or otherwise) that is willing to deposit their check and provide checking and/or ACH services so they can process refunds.
@_date: 2013-06-11 21:48:10
As far as I can figure based on what people have told me and what I see in my own account, Bitfloor disabled the web backend for both ACH withdrawals and BTC withdrawals some time in the first three weeks after the exchange closed (possibly sooner). I don't know why BTC withdrawals are disabled, though, since sending BTC is not contingent on the status of the USD bank account. Fixing this seems entirely within Bitfloor's powers at present.
Once Bitfloor states that USD withdrawals are enabled again, I'll keep monitoring the situation to see if people actually start getting their funds back. If BTC withdrawals are still disabled at the time, I'll see if there's anything I can do to help.
