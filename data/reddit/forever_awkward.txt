What's the reference? Is there a Stone of Jordan meme that I've missed out on all these years?

It does, but your characters are dead. I'm sorry.

The character is there, but unplayable, as it's a weird robey man like the "dark wanderer".
You let them succumb to evil through neglect.

Asking people to source their understanding of a topic is dumb.

You don't see how that situation is a little bit different than this one?

What if I told you the most reliable source is a person who looks at multiple outlets of information and uses their own judgement to accumulate knowledge, rather than one linkable web page that says a thing?
Anyone who forms their entire working knowledge of a subject around "This one easily linkable page says X therefor X" is going to be lacking.

Pssst. I'm still not the guy who was asked for a source. That was a different person. I know reddit's comment structure is super complex, but, you know..
*Internet 101, kiddo. Maybe learn how it works.*

I think you may be a bit confused.

I am confusingly outraged!

It will take about 10-15 years, since we're throwing out arbitrary numbers that none of us can realistically be confident in.

That's what you think.
