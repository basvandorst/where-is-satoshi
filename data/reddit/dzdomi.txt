We are not talking about importing keys or anything similiar. We are talking about looking up transactions, where your key/address is not stored on the btc node (cause of reasons stated above). For THIS you need a txindex.


Like i said again: handling privkeys on a node that has a OPEN connection to the internet is straight careless. No reliable exchange would do that. They manage their privkeys themselves on servers that are completely isolated from the internet.

Normally you dont have your privkey imported into the node; you just submit the signed rawtransaction to the node, to avoid getting your priv key lost in case of a bug in the node, as it has an open attack surface (the p2p port)

Maybe they upgraded their btc node to 0.17.0? The documentation for this release includes that a downtime will be possible and take some hours
They have txindex enabled as otherwise they cant read the transactions

There are other use cases for an exchange where you need txindex: imagine cold/hotwallets, checking sweeps/freezes/deposits/withdrawals from individual wallets;
Regarding handling privkeys: we are talking about exchanges where this is their daily business, handling MILLIONS of USD equivalent btc. They keep their privkeys in the most isolated way possible. This is not some normal bitcoin user with a few btc
