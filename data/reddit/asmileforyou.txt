You could end up sending back to an exchange address instead of the original owner. Instead, you should post your BTC address here and wait for the original owner to find you through Google.

Please add Kucoin (150-300m volume daily) to the list of exchanges that use batching.

The goal of the attackers is to make Bitcoin so slow that people leave and switch to the other coin, which they control. Since the other coin doesn't have Segwit, a special mining optimization can be used when mining the other coin that makes the attacker's mining group earn much more profit than other miners.

That person was taking donations on Twitter for a giveaway fund.

No, decentralized exchanges will address this issue. Code is law.

You're correct, which is why Ethereum Classic exists.

Don't forget about atomic swaps, which make it a lot easier to move excess transaction volume to LTC. LTC certainly proved its worth over the last month.

Coinbase doesn't support or is slow to support hard forks like Bcash, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Diamond, so holding them in an external wallet allows you to claim coins from those forks and sell them. Selling Bcash and Bitcoin Gold would have enabled one to get as much as 0.3 BTC for each bitcoin owned.

The DAO is irrelevant to Ethereum's future; it only happened because of shitty programming by the DAO coders. Attacking Ethereum for the DAO debacle is as ridiculous as attacking the Bitcoin protocol for the MTGox hack.

I second this, as 1 BTC will have much more of an impact for a smaller charity like randomizer's. We know he isn't a scammer because he's showing what he's doing with donations. Last but not least, due to the small size of his charity much less money is lost to administrative costs compared to a larger charity.

The reason BCH drastically increased in value after the Coinbase announcement was because many people (mainly BCH supporters) believed that BCH being purchasable on Coinbase would lead to "normal people" buying BCH instead of BTC because BCH was cheaper. Thus, people with inside information were able to purchase BCH and then resell it at 2x the price.
If all coins are available on a decentralized exchange to begin with, obviously speculation based on whether that coin would be added to that exchange wouldn't be possible.

It reached 8k on Coinbase the first time it was added due to low volume (trading was open for less than 1/2 hour) - then on the actual launch a few days later it opened at 4.4k, quickly fell to the low 3k range, went back up to 4k or so, then resumed falling and never went above 4k ever again.

Memes are way easier to digest, even if articles about stuff like how Lightning Network works and how fake Satoshi's claims are false are interesting as well.

Chances are that he doesn't have to worry about double spends since they're going out of the way to eat at his restaurant in the first place, so he'd be fine accepting 0 conf txs. Furthermore, the fee would be $1 at most and will continue to fall as Segwit adoption increases.

Due to the habits of a particular subreddit dedicated to USA's president, posts which have been stickied are not visible on r/all. Therefore, a new thread must be made.

The reason BTC is going horizontally is because the trajectory looks like [this](

GDAX was the first exchange to pass $9000, leading the other exchanges by about $100.

As of the time of posting there's still 160 BTC in the sell wall at $9000.
Edit: Holy shit the sell wall just evaporated, it's now $9080

The first time I heard about BCG, I thought it was a cool project until I scrolled down and saw it was being premined. Fuck that.
