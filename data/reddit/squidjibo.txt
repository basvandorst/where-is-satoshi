How much would you have to invest in a machine for it to be powerful enough and profitable? What are the major components? Thanks.

Could you tell me what the Tether situation is? Thanks. Ootl.

That was just to disqualify low quality replies, thanks for your thoughts!

All of these examples assume that bitcoin is inherently worthless and that the value inevitably falls to zero, in which case it's a zero sum game. 
But we have different outlooks on its future, using the housing analogy as an asset, housing has consistently risen over history and is unlikely to ever fall to zero. The same is possible for Bitcoin. Not certain, but possible.

Not true, I could sell now at profit and someone else could buy from me. If they sell in 10 years at a profit then we have both profited, it is not a zero sum game.

If this was bitcoin, the fourth person most likely wouldn't sell it back to one of the first three, someone else would buy it, no one in that scenario has  lost any money, in fact, they've all profited, so the statement, "in order for one person to profit, the other must lose" is not true in this case, I feel I have demonstrated that and you are yet to disprove it, but thanks for your perspective and time. 
Also, new money does enter the bitcoin market, hence why the market cap goes up, not sure why you keep saying no new money enters the market.

Wouldn't FUD be more technical? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:51:46
That's understandable, but that's not how investing in an asset works.
E.g. if a fourth person comes along and offers to buy all 3 shares for 360, then the original players now have 120 each, all making a profit, at this stage, no one has lost, which the original person before you said in order for someone to make a gain, someone has to make a loss, which isn't true, otherwise inflation alone would be at the expense of the 'losers' who are supplementing the price increase. There is no necessity for the new owner to be forced to sell at some point for 300 again. There is no fixed amount box scenario where people have to leave their money in one asset and no new money can come in.
While it's possible that someone can lose while another wins, it's not a necessity, or a zero sum game, as new money can enter the system.
Using the example of one person buying an asset for $100, and then selling that asset to someone at $150, explain to me (please) how anyone in this situation has taken a loss if it were a zero sum game. 
Another example, in Australia, price houses have from about $80,000 to $400,000 in the last 20 years, if investing were a zero sum game, then this gain would be entirely fueled by the "losers" losses, which is obviously not the case, if I bought a house today, I haven't lost $320,000 in real money.

I think the posts were much more positive and technical, talking about potential solutions such as lightning when the price was going up. Now the front page of bitcoin is literally filled with memes and negative comments. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:05:18
I may be wrong, but I'm assuming they mean they will continue to buy as it falls from 8 to 4, if that happens, if not, then they obviously wouldn't.

Thanks for your comment

All coins are tanking and it has nothing to do with what you said, otherwise Monero would be up. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:09:42
Literally, lol, it's like $8k
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:15:08
And my post lol, do you honestly think this is the case though? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:53:01
It's a serious reply, can you explain how one person has to lose if another wins when selling an asset? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:45:48
I don't feel like that, if you feel like that you were only in it for a quick gamble because of Fomo and probably only had a few hundred bucks to "invest".
I have owned since 2013 and as the price went to $6,000, I told myself I would buy more if it went down to $4k. This hasn't happened yet so I haven't bought because it was ridiculous. I laughed the whole way up, partook in feeling rich though knew it didn't matter because I never sell, and now it's going down I'm happy. 
If it hits $4k I'll buy more. I believe it will be worth more than that in years to come.

How do you find out how many bytes in a transaction to calculate the fee?

Oh I didn't realise that people ran out /s. 
He could hold indefinitely (there's no need to sell, I still have mine after more than 4 years), or utilise it at its current value, or cash it out for fiat. 
So here's a demonstration:
P1 buys 1Btc for $100, sells to P2 for $200, who sells to P3 for $300.
P3 then cashes out his Btc for fiat. 
So no, the last guy doesn't lose money. Now if you can prove that wrong then I will concede, but the above example is what I was trying to point out in my very first comment. It is not a zero sum game.

I understand that people have been saying it for not just months, but since it came out. What I'm referring to is the change in sentiment on this subreddit with no underlying change in anything other than price. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:48:46
The benefit comes if it doesn't go down to $4k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:17:33
I plan to hold what I have forever, I'm also a stock investor in ETFs and bitcoin is only a small part of my total investments. Though I will buy more when I feel that the price is reasonable, it's not possible for me to buy at this price when I've bought for $200 in the past. 
Edit: by hold forever I mean that I may use it in the future if it becomes more integrated as planned by all the investors and businesses working in this space.

If someone tries to insult someone by saying something along the lines of "you're just a stupid (something)", then yes, "I'm too rich to care" is a good enough response.
