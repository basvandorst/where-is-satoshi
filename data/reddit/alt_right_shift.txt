No worries, betterer is a perfectly cromulent word.

It's like when you have a problem, and you think to yourself, "I know, I'll use pip!" Now you have two problems.

It's OK. I thought Tumblr was exclusively a porn site until I came to Reddit.

I quit buying drugs to hang on to bitcoin. Am I doing it wrong?

The bitcoin bookkeepers remind me of the [JabbaWockeeZ](

Are you telling me the frogs aren't being turned gay?

And yet my point still stands. In this case the protocol is an implementation of a technology. Iphones aren't an application either, but smart phones didn't really take off prior to their introduction. Please go be wilfully dense someplace else.

The Internet is made up of hardware, so no, it doesn't weigh 0.2 millionths of an ounce. Maybe you're thinking of the World Wide Web.

What I'm wondering is, what happens on the exchanges and price when everyone with a clue pulls their bitcoins out at the end of July?
