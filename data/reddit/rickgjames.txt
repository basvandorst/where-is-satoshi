I currently don’t have a hardware wallet yet but I am going to be ordering one today. I am a little curious to how it works though, do I have one send address for the Wallet that I can use anywhere even if the hardware wallet is at my home? I buy BTC in person through debit, would I bring the wallet?
I’ll check out electrum, thanks!

Ahhh okay I see. Yeah it’s a shame, but maybe I can find an iPhone app that stores QR codes so I can just use that instead? 
I am definitely switching to a hardware wallet though, thank you so much for the info!

I tried downloading the Nano Ledger app on my iPhone but it says it’s not available to Canadian accounts. How would I get the QR code for my wallet with no app access?

Ahhh okay I see, it makes sense that a lot of it’s done through a web browser or chrome extension. 
Thank you for all the info, a lot of my uncertainties have been cleared up. Much appreciated!

Definitely! 
I am buying the bitcoin so they need to have my QR code or public send address for the wallet I want the BTC sent to right? With a hardware wallet, where will I find the QR code? In the software when I plug it in? 
I am assuming there are different addresses for BTC, eth, etc. Do the addresses stay the same? Can I get my BTC receive address once and not have to plug the wallet in again?
The guy above was mentioning android only app, since I have an iPhone I was curious if it would hinder my access to the QR code for receiving bitcoin quickly.

Ahh okay so the seeds are for recovery purposes? 
For buying in person, couldn’t I take a picture of the address and have them type it in manually? But now that I think of it I can place orders online, so I can use a fresh address. 
I have an iPhone. I trade quite a bit and was worried getting the send address for the wallet, would no phon access be an issue?
