It won't, even if it goes back to like $10 there will be loads of people hoarding them because they know the potential.

Have not had an atm charge me in 29 years, Netherlands.
You pay for your band account, and they make money investing your money. Paying for an atm is madness

Who are you and how did you get into my Bitcoin account?

For you, presumed tech-savvy Reddit user and Bitcoin follower it's relatively easy.
Meanwhile, the average mom has trouble distinguishing Google from Gmail, or can't pay for their parking ticket with an app.
The only reason Bitcoin will truly take off is if the masses adopt it as a payment system, but they won't unless the world has been set on fire (Venezuela for example).
Issues with Bitcoin
* People don't know what it actually is. How is value determined? Why is it so volatile?
* There are various look-a-like crypto's, which one is the 'real' Bitcoin?
* Wallets, hardware wallets, online wallets? What's the difference? What's safe(st)?
* Users use their keys all-the-damn-time. How many tens of thousands of people have Bitcoin locked in accounts they will never be able to access again? At least your bank will help you recover your money.
* Acquiring Bitcoin is too complex. What are the prices, what are the fees? How can I trust this (shady) website? 
* Sending and receiving money is too expensive for small transactions.
* Bitcoin is mostly bought as an investment, rather than used for actual payments. People are scared to spend any of it because in 3 years you can buy a house with the price of a current pizza.
Downvote me all you want. The average Joe is far far far from adopting Bitcoin and if you believe otherwise you're extremely naive.

I'm with you. I have little bitcoin as an investment and fomo.
However, it's just way too complicated and expensive. It doesn't work for small p20 transactions. It's too complex for 99% of the people and I've not seen that change over the last few years. Transactions from my bank are virtually free and instant.

I'm just trying to point out from an 'outsider point of view' how Bitcoin appears and appeals to me. It's not about how I feel, it's about being very realistic about its shortcomings.
Sure it's good to see doubling your money in a few days, but that has nothing to do with the future of a currency.

Because diamonds are a scam. There's enough diamond in the world to give everyone on earth a cup full, but the supply demand is in very strict control. Creates the illusion of something unique or rare.
Diamond business *Eurostar Diamond Traders* recently went bankrupt. They had a revenue of about € 2 billion a year. I suspect the entire industry to collapse like a house of cards within 20 years.

I am serious to a degree. Sure I could find out these questions, but it about being accesible to the vast majority of the population for it to become 'the next big thing'.
I won't go into depth on all your points, but you actually answered some questions for me so thank you for that.


You vastly overestimate the average computer/smartphone user.


The volatility in value holds me (and many others) back from actually doing that. Sure, you can't help or solve that, but it's a serious issue. Having your assets decimated over-night is not a very stable to build upon.

I'm almost 30, with ~24 years of tech-savvy history. I build websites a profession. I've followed this sub for 1-2 years (superficially). And yet, I barely understand Bitcoin. 
It's not really about the technical details, but the practicality of it.
* If you don't own the hardware, you don't own the coins. Ok well, I downloaded an app and entered some credentials there, so technically it's on my hardware, but herpaps I'm dependent on the app? I don't know.
* If I own a hardware wallet, do I need that everywhere to pay? So if im abroad, I need to bring my USB stick? Or have a second one for travel (with only a limited amount on it?)
* Where do I trade Bitcoin, why do all trading websites have different rates?
* Why does it cost me €4 to move €250 to a friend? In the Netherlands, money transfer is virtually free with very good online banking and apps. 
* But Lightspeed! Yea, what is that? Who controls it? How do I even use that, rather than the 'regular'(?) network? Why are there two or more standards?
I could go on and on.
**Bitcoin needs to overcome many hurdles to become something bigger than a trading option**
* It needs a lower complexity on all fronts
* It needs to be accessible to people of all ages, ragardless of how tech-savvy they are
* It needs to stop being seen as a stock/trade option, but rather a true currency as much as possible.
I'm young, tech savvy and interest in decentralisation of currency. I would be the ideal person to 'invest', yet I only bought €250 at 14k in the FOMO run. I will not invest another Euro until some or all of these problems have been solved, until then the Bitcoin is worthless.

Unrelated? Also the least interesting part of my comment. I don't care about that money, but I don't wanna be that guy that thought "if only I bought xx back then id have xxxx now". 
I mentioned it so people can decide if I have anything at stake, and from what background my message is posted.

I know someone in the Netherlands with a 75k (student) debt. This is humongous in the Netherlands. Interest rate is 0.12% which is added to the loan if you can't afford to pay more, and maximum payments have been set by the government. Currently this amounts to about 200 bucks a month. Oh and the full debt will be discarded after 15 years.
