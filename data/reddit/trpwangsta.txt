what's a good American exchange that lets you swap fiat for crypto, not associated with CB?

there is a nootropics sub that has some awesome info and stack examples all over the place. Check it out r/nootropics.

Reading OPs comments he seems to be about 18yrs old. No point in trying to reason with him.

Man panic selling is never even a thought to me. Panic buying.....that is another idiotic story.

Anyone who accepts BTC for payment understands the volatility. I accept btc for payment, say I charge $1k for the service. If you pay me the $1k today, our transaction is complete. I don't get to come back to you crying that btc has dropped 20% the following week. 
In your instance, if you have a month to pay me and you pay in full, again, our transaction is complete. Doesn't matter about the remaining days you have to pay because you've already paid in full.

It would be great if we could get a single person worth voting for. We're left choosing between dog shit and dog shit rolled in pubes. Hoping for a better 2020 election.

Ya I fucking moved my limit order up from 10k to 11k and was so pumped it hit. Hindsight is a bitch, if only I could keep my emotions in check.

So much hate towards an extremely successful and massively influential human being. Robert is probably responsible for countless investors and entrepreneurs getting started and leaving the corporate life behind. Glad a bunch of losers in here feel the need to blindly shit on him. And so what if he wrote an MLM book, millions of people are involved in them whether you like it or not, he's just educating people and making money while at it. The guy knows what the fuck he's talking about. But I'm sure most of the posters here are highly successful and have massive net worths....

Lol classic. Have you not been able to accumulate enough the past 6 months? 
I'm just flicking shit because there was a thread about playing bingo with all the bullshit crypto sayings during this bear market. And you said a classic 1 liner.
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:48:36
This is missing the famous "this is the last time we'll see prices this low!!" Been hearing that for the past 6 months and about 80%+ ago.

Cheap lesson my man. Don't let it eat you up. Just don't be an idiot in the future. If something seems to good to be true, it probably is man. A quick google search would have saved you your sats.

I had to consciously change my mindset about asking and telling people what and how much i hold. For some reason when I would meet a fellow crypto enthusiast we'd immediately talk about our holding. I would ask how many BTC they held out of excitement wondering if they were one of the lucky ones that were sitting on thousands from years ago. I soon realized it's as stupid as asking someone how much money they have in their checking account. Oops.

I'm waiting for my in laws to get interested again. Wait a couple months after, then sell. Trust me, I'm a TA pro too.

That's only if it doubles by 2024.

They meant 25 billion bitcoins.

So you can just take the tape recorder and fly across the country, what's so cool about that!?

My buddy got me into BTC in 2016. Bought 3 of them, only thing is he didn't inform me it was a fucking ponzi scheme and I didn't actually own them. It was fun kissing 7K goodbye. I didn't quit, but that was a nice lesson learned.

Not every asset is vaporware though. I'm not going to mention specific coins, but there are quite a few ones that have real world use cases. Few and far between, but still, there are legit roses in these thorn bushes.

If you sign up on GDAX, can you basically link your login, bank info,  and verification all from your coinbase account? I've honestly just been lazy and not opened a GDAX due to the ease of CB.

Well when you buy $10 in bitcoin, then the price crashes super hard 2% of course you panic sell. Then the price moons up 3% and fomo kicks in you gotta buy again. Then instantly a major 4% crash comes and of course the smart move is cutting your losses at that point. Of course as soon as you sell btc skyrockets 2.5% and the pump is on so you gotta buy in again right?
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:20:03
Exactly. We want to stand up to this bitch? How about not buying into his bullshit FUD and NOT selling. Who gives a shit what this pig says. Isn't the point of crypto us having power anyway?
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:52:29
Perfect, just like RIP in peace.

I think the whole "hoverboard" attachment hurt these boards a ton. I think they're quite fun to ride, but they're not a damn hoverboard.

Not sure about you, but coinbase only allows $2,500 in total transactions a week! Very disappointing as I'm wanting to add to my positions now but can't. Think I'm going to set up a Gemini account as well.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:58:19
I've always been super curious on these stores. I wonder if they're profitable and what the financials look like.
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:43:49
Wtf and of course this fool used to completely shit on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:49:07
Can you link a bank account to Bittrex or do you need to transfer btc to the exchange to trade?
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:17:49
This is something that isn't talked about much. I will be following suit, as I'm sure many others will too. I got into crypto in 2016 and got hyped on some alts. Now I'm strictly buying BTC so can't wait to HOPEFULLY swap out most the alts for BTC when/IF the bags get lighter.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:39:24
Same for me kind of. Waiting for a check to clear that I deposited Saturday. Why can't the dips last longer than 4 or 5 fucking hours!!
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:40:18
Exactly. I knew a check was going to clear that would cover my order, yet they still cancel it. And they cancel it within 15mins of placing the order.

You forgot to add the TA. I was looking at the century charts and see a very intense Poseidon's kiss forming at the quadruple bottom so it's definitely going up sometime in the next 8 years. I'm almost positive.
