Easy, move over to crypto.com app. Easy the best app out there to buy BTC, no beating its prices.

Honestly, this is such a relief. I really thought it was going to affect them too... Roll on US launch!
My MCO card has become my main card now.

It just needs adoption. A way of spending that retail merchants have taken onboard. I personally like crypto.coms latest approach. They have set aside merchant acquisition tokens and customer acquisition tokens to incentivise adoption of their new CRO blockchain. 
The blockchain is designed to enable customers to pay in any crypto and the merchant to receive any other crypto OR Fiat. All this on a network that's 50% faster than Visa's. Its a bold vision that they have planned out over 5-10 years, but if it works it would be genius. Head to crypto.com/chain.

Yep, you're right, you only need 25k transactions per second just like the visa network. However, it is what happens after that transaction that will appeal to merchants. In todays world, the transaction is only the first step, followed by days of processing behind the scenes before the merchant receives the money. This can change with crypto.coms vision and this is an incentive. 
Furthermore, merchants will have access to the crypto world of consumers. Incentive two. Finally, those that sign up will be given financial incentive through the gifting of a portion of the merchant acquisition tokens.
As for the customers, the incentive will be given to them through discounts for adopting the new system and again, a portion of the tokens allocated for customer acquisition.

No worries at all. This is the beauty of crypto.com's vision, the CRO blockchain is the second part of their vision; adoption of a new decentralised system. As you said, this will be a long and difficult road with a 5-10 year plan in the works. 
The first part (which I am currently invested in) is the MCO token. The MCO token is primarily used to reserve MCO visa platinum debit/credit cards. These are obviously built on today's infrastructure and is the bridge to the technology gap that is currently existing in crypto. That is to create an easy way for newbies to not only buy/sell/store crypto, but also spend it.
These cards have huge benefits; up to 2% crypto cashback on all purchases, airport lounge access, referal system, concierge and access to an automated crypto investment portfolio with credit coming soon too. Not only that, they have perfect interbank exchange rates when abroad. This is why crypto needs for adoption.

Crypto.com are effectively working on this. They have an app where you can buy/sell/exchange BTC and a whole host of other coins. This can then link to your Visa platinum card that they are looking to integrate into Apple Pay/Samsung Pay etc.
They also have crypto.com blockchain chain that will enable users to spend in any crypto and the merchant can chose to receive any crypto (or fiat). It looks really really slick too.
 
I'm a mod on their forums and I actually mentioned this exact scenario you pointed out to them and said they should approach Samsung on how they can make it a reality.

There is so much going on behind the scenes here guys. Crypto.com is going to be the parent company to a whole host of projects, starting with the consumer facing MCO financial product.
MCO app is available now and they are currently testing their platinum cards for a summer launch in Singapore and the EU. The cards look fantastic. Check out: 
However, more than just a card, MCO is building an ecosystem around the token. There's going to credit feature that will lock up MCOs for credit, reduced fees on the invest feature, reduced trading fees, airdrops, token listing voting, referrals etc... However, many believe the exciting stuff is yet to come....
Many are speculating that crypto.com will be used as an accelerator for other projects and that MCO plan on using the invest function to drive new ICOs through crypto.com. 
All in all, we really haven't seen all that MCO have to offer and none of us have the complete vision. But for me, this is the most exciting project in the crypto space with a real world use case today. The scope is enormous and the stage is set. ��
