I enjoyed it. Only feedback is that some of the cheesy moments lingered a little too long, but that could just be my personal taste.

Nothing here checks enough boxes to be a coinbase replacement for the masses.

And how would you suggest the average person sells/buys crypto with ease? 
They make it easy as ABC 123 and that has value to many people.

Well said.

I've seen two ATMs in the East Bay, CA. Also, one business, a barber that accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum.

I mean right now in USA, the states that have legalized marijuana sales are in conflict with the federal law. So banks are not letting Marijuana businesses use traditional banking. But the businesses are still thriving!

This guy gets it.

I don't understand all the inner workings here. But it doesn't seem fair that banks get instant lowest possible rate loans on demand to solve their liquidity problems, while the general population has to fight over whatever rates are available in the market.

Lol might as well :)

System is inherently wrong, but your framing is poor.
@_date: 2019-09-24 05:55:47
That seems reasonable. Why not do that?
