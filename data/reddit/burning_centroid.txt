You don't seriously think Trump/Republicans are trying to fuck us LESS with their tax reforms do you?

I'll grant you that, perhaps not the classiest response to "Maybe you should stop sucking down globalist bankster propaganda from the MSM like it's your job"

Noob at spelling here...

Given that this spaceshipguitar guy is both calling bitcoin a ponzi and also revealing he’s following things like what portion of the crypto market cap bitcoin is taking up, I’m gonna go out on a limb and say he’s most likely a bcash guy here looking to spread fud

There’s nothing illusory about the value of the networking infrastructure that a bitcoin represents either...

Lol you’ve convinced exactly 0 people because your argument revolves around pretty much redifining what a ponzi really is. If you can’t see the real value of rapid international transactions with minimal fees then you should stop trolling yourself

You mean the reform that'll lower my taxes in the short term and raise them in the long run? Look, whatever observations about "what I know" you want to try to squeeze from a one sentence comment, the only point I was trying to make is that it's "optimistic" to think any plan will get passed that doesn't fuck most people

You seem more invested in attacking the community than in anything related to crypto. Go outside or get a hobby or something, if you’re so anti crypto why do you even care what other people do with it?
