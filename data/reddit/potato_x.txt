The main reason I use Coinbase is ease of bank transfer. What's been your experience on Gemini? Good/bad/just as easy?

Mycelium. Just click miner fee, low priority, and select fee amount. You can go as low as you wish. It's a choice to pay a high fee.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:07:30
Get a better wallet, or select a lower fee. The high fee is on you, not the network.

To that end; this was a bridge to far, time to vote with my node.

When you select economy, touch the fee and slide to the right there are additional choices.

I get how to roughly calculate the value of a stock or bond. How do you value a currency? This is unfamiliar territory for myself.

So bitcoin value is dependent on becoming a reserve currency? Else, it would displace nothing?

Do we need instant confirmations? For large transactions current confirmation times are a step change improvement over existing bank networks. For small, I have yet to hear of a double spend.

Fair, so in the long run its value would follow global "GDP", and in the short its based on only supply? How does FOREX trader approach the probem?

I propose bicoin valuation is like capacitance in an electrical system. How would one calculate the required network size to support current and future valuations? I assume the idea of becoming a reserve currency is far beyond the current visible horizon.

Love the point, thanks for articulating it.
thumbs up @_date: 2014-12-29 11:24:59
Continuously improve, good point.

Extended that thought; why do we pay Western Union 15.2M / day? Miners are cheap. 
I think your question can be asked differently; why do companies not hold local cash indefinitely rather than reinvest in their business or diversify their assets?
I would suggest they are growing their business or hedging forex risk.
What transaction volumes are needed to offset miner rewards?

Aren't side chain models equivalent to derivative models? What's the difference?

Coinbase is a glimpse of the future of banking. They provide the convenience of currency exchange, and are secure enough to hold the balance of a small checking account. They are going to have to keep finding ways to provide value, else, to your point they to will become obsolete as the Bitcoin network gains functionality.

I guess I'm thinking a certain amount of bitcoin has to be held to facilitate trade. Folks and businesses would optimize this to a min. How big does the network have to get in order for this holding to support current valuations?
Can an electrical system be used to model cash flow?

What is the cloud hashing business model? I still don't see it.

What's next... We all wear pocket cams just in case the NSA needs to know who we associate with, and what we might be talking about; all secured with NSA approved encryption of course.
Tar and Feather gov supporters of this nonsense.

Also, some gift cards have "service fees" that slowly eat their balance. Most don't notice or care because they were received as gifts and perceived to be "free".

I always stop in when visiting Allentown. Thanks for being a pioneer. Every time I've bought from your store the transaction has been seem less. 
Thanks again!

Good thing you didn't use scaling to manipulate the message (eye roll - Rodney Dangerfield style)

Argument regarding tax doesn't make sense. The coffee shop would pay zero tax on a capital loss. Further the assumption that an all owners covert to fiat is presumtious.

Because Keyser Soze told him to.
