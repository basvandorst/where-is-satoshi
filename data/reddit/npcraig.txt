Whatever he has made in fees ($1.9m?) during this is chump change compared to what he would make if MtGox was still a powerhouse. I feel he probably does give a shit.

This is really nifty. I work at a small small accounting firm (as an intern getting a Masters in Accounting). I have since decided to switch to a CISA over CPA focus but I am very interested about how the Big 4 view Bitcoin. I feel Bitcoin would allow for large accounting firms to keep perfect records and do great audits on companies who keep their Bitcoin on the books.
I have mentioned BTC a lot around the office, sh!t bitcoiners say you know ;), and people are interested but it is very risky to everyone. I would be really interested to read your article whenever it gets published. Thanks for the post.

Exactly this. The feds show Coinbase any legal doc saying info will help in a case they will prob hand it right over.

exactly, you don't want it to just be magic. people are afraid of what they don't understand so you need to lay it out for them so they can understand it really is more than just "internet money."

You're thinking way more long term than this Newsweek debacle. I am talking about a time frame relative to the remainder of this Satoshi lawyer/statement/potential lawsuit debacle. Is it also possible that he was the leader of a group of anonymous 'Satoshis'? He is now just protecting them?  O.o
I would say Developers will give unneeded weight to whoever is "in charge" of Bitcoin, no matter if it is who created it or not (see gavin andresen vs charlie lee in 1/5/10 years?).
Just my opinion, I agree overall in the long run for btc. I also don't really care if he is Satoshi or not, I donated to aantonop's fund as a thanks/sorry lol

If you are telling me that it doesn't matter to the general public and their interpretation of Bitcoin as a whole via the media and such (which I believe plays a huge part in the price of BTC), then we disagree.
I think that if Dorian was the inventor it could be a prime time for him to step back into the spotlight and shed good light on Bitcoin. However, if he was a part of it and still wants to have no part of it the first approach (I would assume) would be to issue a statement through a lawyer denying everything because of lack of evidence. 
I have no idea if Dorian is Satoshi, but this is one hell of a story to watch develop.

Only if I can exchange my BTC for another cryptocurrency if BTC falls from grace.

And to think, Kraken and other exchanges thought US pressure was too hard to deal with...

Might get downvoted, but the question is:
If she issues a statement saying she still believes her story, who is telling more of the truth?
