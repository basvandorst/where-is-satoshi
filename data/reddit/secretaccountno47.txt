I almost ruined my family's future.
I bought 10 bitcoin before it all hit 4k. It was essentially 60% of my family's savings.
I also just bought a trezor, and had moved all my crypto onto it.
I had written down my seed-phrase and was going about memorizing it. I - moronically - used the sheet of paper as a bookmark in a book that I was taking literally everywhere I would have time to read.
On a trip out of state with my family for a friend's wedding, I lost the book at some airport.
The entire weekend was a silent hell. Every second would be an eternity of my wondering if I ruined my family's future.
The instant my mind would finally stop thinking about it, suddenly a crushing reminder of my fuck-up would make me want to vomit.
I didn't want to tell everyone that I might've ruined our future, but everyone could tell that I was devastated.
I told my wife, who, for as much shit as this community gives wives, told me that it wasn't a big deal, and that we would just have to work hard to secure our future if it were all gone. There's a special place in heaven for a woman like this.
Every time I looked at my phone I was reminded of my devastation - I had numerous Bitcoin-related apps on my phone.
The weekend is one I will NEVER forget. It was the worst weekend of my life, even though it should have been a fun one.
Luckily, the money was never stolen, I switched all the money onto a new wallet and we're living great.
I don't know if this will help or hurt, but here's Urban Meyer, the coach of the Ohio State Buckeye football team, talking about how to best deal with disappointment.
I think he's got a lot of things right.

Europe is a socialist hellhole. If there's one thing socialists can't understand, it's "I took the risk, and thus I reap the profit or loss". 
I talk about my profits - a little bit - here in the States, and not once has anyone asked for a share of the gains. 
Not a single time. 
They begin asking questions about how to get into BTC, and if I can help them figure it all out, but that's it.
Socailism is a disease - one that's REALLY hard to rid yourself of. It's like the zombie plague movies: once you get infected, you have to constantly attack other people until they're nothing but a shell of what they once were.

It's at $10,7661 right now.
I think, this time, the psychological barrier was for BUYING. No one thought it would hit 10k...
... but now that it has, people are like "fuck it, I wanted it anyway".

A high chance the co-workers are socialist/communist/liberal husks of things that had once been designated 'human'.

How do you do something like this?

The important question is whether he will cut his left finger to eat the pain.
Jay-Z getting in worries me.

that was amazing, it got to 1796, then plummeted 100 in under 20 minutes
