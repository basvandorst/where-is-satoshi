Yes, those are the videos. It was also called the Princeton Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies course.
Their old page is here 
I saw all the videos online and did the exercises on my own. 
Overall it's good, but would've loved if things were even more technical. It only had 4 exercises.
Stanford should be starting their next BTC course soon

correct me if I'm wrong, but there's something else that seems to be ignored in the comments here: the block that your tx was included into might not belong to the "winning chain", meaning that there is a small probability that the block will be discarded and your tx will have to be included into another block

they don't need to yet. they have $27M in funding

"Jennifer R. Jacoby, lawyer at WilmerHale"
so maybe, just maybe, a very rich person hired a laywer to buy the coins for them?
given all the history behind Bitcoin, that would be the ironic thing to happen

The charts are not from the Cato Institute. They are mostly taken from Blockchain.info. This page seems to simply explain what they mean

it's not really decentralized when a single entity controls all the machines.. that's just a distributed system

the metrics they are using are pretty much a copy of what  has

do I, being the lender, still get the 1.01 back no matter what?

It's going to be really interesting to know who won. 
Let's speculate:
- Matrix Capital Management?
- Coinbase? (they would take a hit on the funding they got..)
- ~~Rangeley Capital?~~ "Chris DeMuth Jr., a partner at Rangeley Capital also confirmed to The New York Times that he was not able to secure a winning bid and declined to reveal his bid but said it was below market value."
- DRW?
- Avarus?

that with time, support will stop and they'll just shut the site down

Was Peter Thiel ever a bitcoiner?
Jed McCaleb was the creator of Mt. Gox and then moved to RIpple and Stellar (remember that?)

good point, and that's why **in practice** we can't really tell how reliable the trading volume data provided by the exchanges is :) 
like the exchanges that charge 0 fees might simply have inflated volumes
but irt off-chain txs, I would be very wary of trading in such *exchanges*

it has warlords, fighting for power
@_date: 2016-09-03 22:02:03
in practice, we don't. 
in theory, we could trace all the txs by looking at the blockchain. but difficult and a lot of hard work.
