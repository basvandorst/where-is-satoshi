It's just speculation. Nothing less, nothing more.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:07:11
Lol, would be tsunami.

@_date: 2017-05-09 16:09:13

@_date: 2017-05-10 17:45:00
Same here on other site. 1,5 day, still pending.
That's why there is only a massive speculation on BTC ATM. We see now: with "massive" transactions, it's not reliable right now.
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:15:52
IMO not.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:06:51
That's just crazy.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:02:14
price go up isn't in the interest to the bank. 
They just would like BTC dont exist anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:22:09
??? DONT
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:43:13

No hope ... for chinese miners :DDDD

@_date: 2017-07-26 13:16:50

Goldman Sachs lol. If it's right, it just means that they manipule the market as fuck, like JP morgan do on gold/silver market.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:59:46
