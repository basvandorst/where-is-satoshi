Sorry to say but in bitcoin circles r/bitcoin isn't the fastest moving top percentile :)
r/bitcoinmarkets users had been warning about the place for a long time and the signs were there via the inflated BTC price indicating increased BTC demand as it's more liquid and easier to withdraw but I do see your point. 
Most near everyone could tell something was off there but greed was the thing that got many people screwed since they were selling bitcoin for higher prices on Gox

You *could* get burned just as easy that way. 
In a dollar crisis scenario you could see hyperinflation of the stock market as people rush to put their fiat into something of tangible value i.e: share of a company. 
In fact many would say this is why the stock market is as high as it is. 
If and when hit hits the fan you will have more time than you think and if you are posting here you are probably more clued in than 98% of the people shower than you.

Why do libertarians always make these *zaney, crazy* abstract remarks

Dude if you feel it's going down more then go for it.
This sub hates the idea of trading and hates to support the idea of *anyone selling* for any reason other than impending death because they want to keep the value up but I made at least three trades today and all were profitable. 
Before you do just be sure to set limits before you do.
As in "if the price goes up/down to $XXX I will buy back then and not risk further losses."
Where people go wrong trading is when the price moves the opposite way they want and they start chasing it, "it can't go any further, I'll just wait 10 more minutes" and next thing you are $50 away from where you want to be.
An hour ago I went short from $520 as the bounce from the low was very week, before I made that trade I said if it goes to $530 I will close my short position at a loss no matter what and hold unless I see a big volume and big buys, so far it's working out good but please don't buy 10000 coins in the next few hours

The same can almost be said about every filed libertarian state or micro-state. eventually everyone agrees some things are better organised in the collective and some rules are worth implementing.

none of what you mentioned has anything to do with communism which by definition has no leaders and no hierarchy

They are not pegged to the euro but they do track it fairly closely by imitating policy but that said like Switzerland they can just decide to go their own way at any moment and if you need proof of this look at GBP, it's always stayed independent since that had that nightmare with ERM and now rising and rising. What if another George Soros decides to try and break the polish bank by forcing them to follow the ECB. 
But look, are we arguing or just trying to set facts straight here as only I seem to be posting evidence for what I say.
Just for arguments sake  lets only include 40% non EU exports and 12% to the UK, that still 52% 
Just link me to where your economist said 30% and put this to bed as I can't see any merit to your claim.
out of interest what sort of structural and fiscal reform do you think is needed in Europe then?

sauce for this?

Table 3
40% of eurozone exports are non EU. 32% are to other EU countries not in the eurozone and therefore with their own floating currency rates,
Yes these figure are not the most recent but they give me reason to believe they are a lot more than 30%.
This is why I ask for sources, points get proven with no ambiguity.

I'm from Finland and I know very well, I don't support the idea of QE in principle either, if they really needed inflation they should just give everyone a tax break or invest the same money in capital infrastructure projects so we could all see some good for it

Read it again


That makes a total of 72% of eurozone exports going to non Euro states meaning states like Poland who use ZTY, UK on GDP, Sweden with SEK, they are not part of the quantitative easing program and they are also gaining against the euro unless their own central banks take action. 
 Exports to Britain from Germany are euro to sterling, a lower euro has just made them more competitive,  
This is what I've been trying to tell you is wrong with your figures the whole time when I quoted this statement of yours


This is not about european exports, the euro only affects the core euro-zone countries

Ok all his work is in french so that's a no go for me so let me take issue with something else that immediately makes me call your figures into doubt.


We are talking about the *euro* which is the currency of the *eurozone* and not the 27 member state EU, I'd be willing to bet my left nut when you take into account how big germany is and it's proportional share of euro exports push this figure well above 30% if you actually had figures for "eurozone exports outside europe"
I'm totally against the implementation of QE, they should have just given eurozone €500 if they wanted to spark inflation and give the economy a kick and I'm not taking issue with what you say, I'd just like to know if that figure is true for my own curiosity.
