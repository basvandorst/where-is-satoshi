We saw it at 10.000 dollars and we see it now, after a big price increase and and new milestone, the price needs to stabilize, but every time it stabilizes at a higher price is a win!

Keep in mind that Bitcoin.com is generally seen as a very sketchy website in the community, maybe a more educated person could tell you more.

you're still one time to invest in Bitcoin, it will only rise further

Could you explain How would that work? When the coin is dropping they get problems on their website?

Relax dude, it’s a joke, ofc wouldn’t have been smart to invest all your money in a new kind of money or stock that hasn’t proven itself yet

Thanks! So it just hoping that when Coinbase will support it, they will give it to their users.
