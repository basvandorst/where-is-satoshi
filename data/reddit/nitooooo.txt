Is bitcoinpaperwallet.com a secure site?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:05:36
A little gdax help please,  i sent a friend a small amount of btc from gdax to his wallet last week, now he’s paying me back, my question is... on gdax is it, (deposit button) then (bitcoin address) option?  I️ just want to make sure, because the address keeps changing (when I️ do a dry run and refresh)  
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:55:06
Oh you must be new here

@_date: 2017-12-02 04:29:29
A little confused at first but I️ figured it out, thanks!!! This is so cool! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:26:45
Little help please, i made a transfer on gdax to another wallet I’d, where can I️ go to look up the status of that transaction?  And what Id do i need to use to search for it? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:09:31
Can some one suggest a good app to track my profit/loss?  I️s there such thing?  I️v just been keeping up with my buy in price and doing the math, just curious is there’s an app out there 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:15:56
Yes nothing received yet... but where do i go to see the transaction status?  I️ withdrew from gdax, and under my transactions it just states a “transfer id”  but not the address it was sent to... very annoying 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:12:03
Does selling it to your usdwallet on the exchange count, of not until you transfer to personal bank?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:09
Lol don’t look at it again until about Friday, you’ll be ok 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:08:47
Go read the terms of service on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:59:29
You’re not a newb you’re an idiot, you’re about to invest money and you didn’t bother reading how it work? Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:41:49
Ok well it showed up now, it unconfirmed but at least I️ know it was sent to the right place. Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:55:31
Is there a way to change the trading pairs? To add Litecoin or other alts I️ have to type in it’s btc value not usd, pretty annoying 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:30
Have the funds been pulled yet? I️ called my bank and let them know in advance that there would be funds being pulled from my account, the representative assured me there would not be a problem, and also made a note of it on my account... not sure if that was all talk or not... but i have not had any problems with BofA

@_date: 2017-11-25 04:25:06
Thank you sir 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:36:38
5900 $ usd  to 1btc @ 7800usd  = 1900$ usd gain,  buying back in would leave you with 1btc @ 7500usd + 400$ usd left over profit in cash... quick maths? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:17:47
Shut up nerd!
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:07:12
Oh yea... I️ think I️ remember swiping the key pad down on the app after typing the amount to get to the continue button behind 
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:10:01
I️ have BofA,  purchased through coinbase on 11/2, email said transfer would complete by 11/10.... funds were withdrawn 11/9,  btc was received 11/14. Not sure if it had anything to do with the high amount of traffic at the time but I️ was so anxious and paranoid for those 12 days lol.

Welcome to the fookin show!
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:09:36
I️ don’t trust the fact that you’re giving the site bitcoins in exchange for tokens in order to lend out, anyone here have any experience?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:29:35
Use a bitcoin atm 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:39:32
Hmmm try removing the account and adding it again?
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:24:36
Delta app or blockfolio app
