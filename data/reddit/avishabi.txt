It's a line of code. What the difference if you send 1 bitcoin or 100 bitcoin? Same fee no? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:55:17
It is possible. In Israel the government know how to connect your identity to any crypto currency you use. Recently they tracked monero users as well.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:50:16
It should be 0.01 $ fee. If not what's the point using crypto currency? People won't abandon their credit card to pay more fees...

Every time is different 
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:12:11
We already been here 3 times... Why do you expect that this time will be different? I think it's going down before the big players will join this ride. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:54:07
Source? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:56:27
Any tool to track the following addresses? 
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:21:35
Too little too late....

Genius! I gonna buy it! They gonna pump bitcoin core to newbies and price will fly to the moon. From 1 cent to one dollar in a week

Question: are you 14 y.o or just stupid? 
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:26:28
Opinion should be based you meant personal desire or gut feeling..... Same here 
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:47:02
You have a lot to learn about facts my friend
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:17:39
Can you please share this? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:33:39
I am the king of buy high and sell low. I bought every pick and sold each and every dip.....

As an Importer i can send btc to my suppliers in China. They see the money in few seconds and it cost me few cents. Previously i sent money with swift and i paid the following: changes comisiones between currencies 1%, swift comisiones 2.5% bank comisiones 1%. And on top the transfer took 3 days to show up. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:12:31
No movement and no trade on bitstamp... 9k isn't a good Price to buy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:35:56
Because it's a round and nice number and i hold few of those bitcoin i bought at 19k
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:06:16
The reason is that i asked a wish for my birthday.... " dear God for one time in my life i want to buy low and sell high"..... Didn't worked, i bought at 11700
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:30:46
If it's true we are facing another dip... 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:12:35
Just remembered this post 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:26:29
I also purchased that price and up to 19k but i understand that the stupid was me anf bitcoin is a real asset / currency looking for his price. We run like ships instead of taking the time and understand. Bitcoin or any other crypto will be the global currency, humanity always moves forward never backwards.

I did something better, i withdrawal my losses. Prefer to lose something than lose everything 
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:46:02
If you can support it by facts it's good if it's just a gut feeling keep it to yourself 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:58:11
Sure! Tomorrow 8:30 a.m. Get ready and buy the freaking dip
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:25:38
Do you know that analyze the top wallets and addresses? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:38:12
I lost 35k. I just withdraw my remaining 11k so i won't feel like i lost everything. In the future i could say i was smart i didn't lost everything.... Lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:48:43
What is really missing in the market is an app that analyze the top 100 to 1000 addresses/wallets. I want to know what the big whales are doing with their coins
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:21:32
It was fun while it lasted... 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:49:18
But my fingers hurts so much.... It's so painful 
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:24:05
Why hodl?? If people won't use the currency and only hodl it it will become useless and will die slowly.... If you love bitcoin don't hodl use it, spend it, buy with it.... Don't kill crypto by hodl it.

Talked so much and said nothing... He could've been a good lawyer 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:01:23
Just sold at 7950$ everything i bought the dip. Clearly it's a market manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:54:39
I asked for bullrun and i got bullshit
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:48:50
This sub is becoming delusional. You guys must get down to earth and sooner the better.

Called Eliot wave. This is the most responsible explanation i read. Until we don't touch 6k (more or less, no one knows the real number) it won't stop. The value needs to adjust to the real value before the fake buzz. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 11:04:11
One of the best i seen
