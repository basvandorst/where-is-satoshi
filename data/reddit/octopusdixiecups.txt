Okay so I just tried it again and this time it worked. It hasn't showed up in my new account yet, so I'm waiting for that and I understand it can take a bit

Ok thanks. I just wanted to make sure there were no other options before I went through with restoring the wallet. 
I don't know if this is a stupid question but what do you mean by "load the backup file" ? what is the backup file?

So i created a new wallet and restored my old wallet but I still can't send my bitcoins to my new wallet because its still requiring google authenticator even though it never gave me a new thing to scan when I restored the wallet. 
What do I do now?
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:32:12
Okay. Its in my new wallet now, it has 1 confirmation
Thats all I have to ask. 
Thank you so much for the help

I have a job that is different from the doggy rescue. We are a legit non profit and I run it out of he house I inherited after my parents died. I do have legit prescriptions for almost all the dogs. My vet knows I buy their meds off the "dark net" instead of from the local pharmacy. He understands and doesn't really object as long as the dogs are kept happy and healthy. We also take on cats and other animals. Most of the animals I care for are elderly and either not able to be adopted out due to health conditions or because I feel they are too old and it would be too much stress on their already old bodies to place them with a new family. 
Btw, it's not Vicodin, but it is an opiate analgesic that I find works wonders on dogs and other animals.

I honestly don't even know what you're talking about. I don't really know anything about Bitcoin. All I know about it is that it's what I have to use in order to buy cheap meds for our animals.
If you want to elaborate though I'll definitely listen.

Do I just go to the website and download it??
Do I have to do anything special to my current wallet before I download? I don't want to accidentally lose my money

Forgive my ignorance, but what does it mean to save bitcoins on your wallet paper? I hear this talked about often and I'd like to learn how

This is probably a dumb question, but if I install the latest version will that update my current wallet or will it create me a completely new wallet?

It's at 2298 now. It's crazy.

I feel like there is an advantage to using Bitcoin if it means I don't have to go into debt in order to buy medications in bulk. I can buy a 3 month supply for under $200 whereas if I went to the pharmacy it would be between $30 and $40 a month per animal. I do have valid prescriptions or at least I did at one point.

Can you elaborate? I'm using electrum. What is going on? Why can't I send any money? If I get a new wallet how do I get it out of my current wallet 
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:33:11
is this what is happening with me? Im trying to move $60 out of my old electrum wallet and I keep getting an error message saying "mempool min fee not met". I moved the slider all the way to the right and clicked "dynamic fees" but I still keep getting the same error message. 
We run a dog rescue and I buy pain medication for the arthritic older dogs using bitcoin. If we had to go through the pet pharmacy it would be over $35 per month per dog.

What does that mean? What is a block chain spammer?
