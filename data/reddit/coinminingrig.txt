Buying asics is always a gamble. Why should the producer sell the machines if they make profits? I had several asics and never broke-even, even when selling them after only a couple of months. GPU Mining is a different thing but maintenance is very high and the trouble is not worth it. Buying the coin you want to mine on a dip is much much better for making profits.

About the supply, I thought it would be the same 21mill - but it’s x4 my bad. But since when is POW scrypt a security risk? It’s still the longest chain of a very similar coin.

Well the account belonging to a personal check can be insufficient funded and the check bounces. Redeeming a check can take up to 12-24h.  
  
The account belonging to a 0 conf tx can not be empty or insufficient funded. 0 conf is  only insecure if you assume the account holder is double spending. Some are already accepting 0 conf because you can pay upfront, get your meal and by the time you‘re done eating the tx has been confirmed.
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:21:31

This is not possible with bitcoin. It was a forced fauxpas from Ethereum. Also you can not “buy up” all bitcoin because every 10 min new coins will be created until finished. The price would also skyrocket into oblivion if you’re trying to “buy up” all.

@_date: 2019-06-15 13:28:57
Wrong. You can still send the same amount with higher fees and the one with more tx fee will get processed sooner.

Writing down your seed phrase from an electrum wallet is not standard practice for a crypto novice. If all your thumb drives get corrupted you have nothing better than a paper wallet. Ledger can not get corrupted.

Take a look at XRP, EOS etc. people sadly don’t care if there are gatekeeper.

Ledger is just controlling your keys which you have a backup on the key sheet. Electrum on a flash drive IS your keys if you don’t generate the private key and write it on a piece of paper.

Ok, cool. You are asked to write it down, is the crypto noob really knowing the importance of this step? I can tell you that the majority doesn’t do this because of convenience. 
  
Still. Corrupted drive = paper wallet. So why bother?

There are sites online which let you see the timeframe in which you are most likely to find a block solo. Bitcoin wise you can totally forget it.  
  
I looked it up because a YouTube miner told once he let’s his L3+ run solo... couple of month ago it was more than 1 year and timespan is not even 100% certain. All the time you spend energy and hoping to hit the jackpot. Better offer a hosting service or invest in new asic miners every few months.

They would never offer this to the retail market. Look at the corporate image of Bitmain. Every ASIC after the L3+ was a loss making operation. Majority thinks it’s bullshit to buy a miner if you want to break even nowadays.

Difficulty can rise very very quickly to levels where your profitability can decrease like that, easy. You have to think about all that when buying a miner, income calculators are only a very rough estimate.  
  
When break even is 6 month with a calculator add 3-6 month to it is more realistic.   
  
Take a look at the dash miner from Bitmain. Never made any profit.

Yup, it’s a tough game overall. If you cleverly sell your hardware at one point you can make a small profit though. Most of cloud mining is a scam, even if it’s legit because your „lifelong“ contracts get busted in a bear market. Just buy the hashrate on your own via nicehash or miningrigrentals if you want to mine remotely not locally on your own.
