Can't wait for the inevitable e-coin vs bitcoin conclusion Sam Esmail has clearly planned ;)

Governments won't have a choice in the matter. Bitcoin is the technological bedrock that gives EVERYONE AND ANYONE extremely strong sovereign financial security. Similar decentralized technologies will unlock the potential for entirely new forms governance (think democracy + efficient automation -&gt; collective consensus on resource distribution). If there is a demand for any service a nation state government currently provides then there will be a market to meet that demand.
Competition good. Monopoly bad.
Bitcoin will maximize global competition across every industry and end the socialist monopoly that central banks enjoy on fiat money.

One does not 'buy bitcoin' on Robinhood

Does this paranoid neighbor of yours know you have bitcoin?

Do you have similar concerns of being kidnapped for your social security  Credit/debit cards? Bank account passwords? Email passwords (which pretty much give people access to all other accounts tied to that email address)? What about the authenticator apps on your phone? How about the keys to your house? Your fingerprints?...
What about more systemic risks such as bank failures &amp; the inevitable debasement of fiat currencies by private institutions, like the Fed, which we have granted the power to create money, not because we collectively believe that manipulating the supply of money can ever HELP a society, but because we simply let bankers take this power.
We live in an age of fear. We are told that there are lots of bad people all around and that is why we need state sanctioned security and huge militaries. The nation state has become a modern day psychological version of feudalism, where we think we need to put up walls to keep the barbarians out.
The truth is that bitcoin is the most unconfiscatable store of value ever created. Cryptography is the most cost efficient, energy efficient, space efficient, time efficient form of sovereign security humanity can mass empower individuals with.

I'm not saying there is a problem, I'm just sharing the thread they deleted  with people it might interest.

I just sold my 24 that I have been holding onto for over a year at £35 then bought back at close to £500 when I saw them going up. I feel sick.

You're missing the point...the idea of Bitcoin is for people to own addresses anonymously. You have included credit cards which are, obviously, not anonymous. That's the fiat money part, the non anonymous part. The anonymous part is the bitcoin part, you know how you don't have to like...register your name against a  bitcoin address.
Seriously man...
