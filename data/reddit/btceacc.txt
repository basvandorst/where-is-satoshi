I can't agee that it's the same as protocol level solutions such as TCP-IP.  This is a highly tailored solution.  Rather than asking the question "How do I make a better, open decentralized payment system" it's obvious that they asked themselves "How can we redirect payments off-chain and move away from our dependency on miner fees".  Radically different objectives and the architecture shows.  
SMS and email protocols are open standards that allow integration.  This on the other hand still just provides the same payment system we have today while *hopefully*(cross fingers) results in transfer times and fees that are still no different to other crypto systems already out there. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:03:40
So that might answer the credit card issue for some, but not the question about free, fee-less transactions offered by other competitors.
Usually you could have counted on the network effect to keep adoption going, but since this is all being squandered as time rolls by, this is unlikely to be any use in several months time.

Ah, I see the personal accusations start. I am actually quite impressed that it took so long.
Some of the adjectives you are using to describe Bitcoin are questionable in its current state.  The concept of "censorship" for one transcends the technology itself. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:30:18
If you were only referring to Bitcoin then this would be more than true.  If it's taking this long to get a scaling solution, how long would it take to get smart contracts and the like?
Other cryptos are moving much faster in this space.  The platforms already exist - it's now about finding use cases and that's also happening quickly.
Good to note AOL which never became anything in the end - it became too sluggish and didn't innovate as fast as the rest.  Same is true for Yahoo, MySpace and the host of other technological greats of their time.  We have enough history to know that first movers can always lose their position to better competition.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:49:42
The other question I have is "Why do I need to ask this question for a virtual currency?" Why are users made to work in a certain way due to limitations in technical design? Why would I choose this crypto over a solution that doesn't impose the same restrictions? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:52:45
So Bitcoin is now like a virtual wallet with more wallets? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:43:58
Worse, it doesn't appear like anyone knows what causes it all. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:37:32
Well, you have to factor in the fee.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:14:04
I had the same icky feeling about other crypto as well, but it's just a matter of time now - and we're talking months, not years.  As with all technology, it keeps improving and getting more innovative. 
I would have never discounted Bitcoin until I saw how this current situation has been handled.  No technology should *ever* think that they're big enough to tell their users to wait for months to fix critical issues.  Real-world people and businesses have been burnt by this and I doubt they see Bitcoin as the revolution it was hyped to be.

If the devs don't care, why should anyone else? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:57:48
I thought we were interested in creating the future, not just replicating what's already there?  What's the incentive to do something that I can already do with cash or credit cards? Especially when I don't have massive risks with potentially losing funds to hackers and having no recourse along with a rapidly fluctuating valuation. 
Also, with new cryptos, we are talking about fee-less, frictionless transactions that don't require you to lock up your funds in such a way.  How is Bitcoin proposing to compete with the next generation of crypto, not just sluggish banks?
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:44:21
I'm not sure you noticed that while the faithful are willing to wait (which is admirable), the rest of the world moves on.  Technology has never favored the slow and Bitcoin will not be the exception.
You seem to forget that Bitcoin has had some 9 years to gain traction for real world uses already.  This is rapidly being unwound as people cry "patience".  Once all this usage is undone, there is no compelling reason after that to choose Bitcoin over any other crypto that is faster (or as fast) and cheaper.

@_date: 2018-01-08 23:11:12
What *is* this "decentralization" that is being talked about?  Bitcoin's development team is not decentralized for one, is it?  If it is, where is the vote to fix the current scaling issues?
And if it's decentralized, why is the Chinese mining ban potentially going to affect the network?  And when the supposed LN network kicks in (which requires hubs that aren't decentralized), won't it *require* that the block-size be increased? 
We seem to be going in a circular argument but one thing is for sure, people aren't ignorant to what's going on here and are using Bitcoin less and less. 
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:57:39
You are being charged not only to pay fees for using it but fund your account as well.  Plus the fees and timing to do all this is determined by network activity.  That's actually more intrusive than PayPal.  And yes, if you deposit your money in a custodial system then by default you have shifted to a centralized system where your funds can be blocked for whatever reason. 
If you add an extra hop you need to add some sort of value as well.
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:19:44
I thought one big point of Bitcoin was to get away from people controlling and potentially blocking your funds? 
 If LN is like PayPal, why not just use PayPal?  Or why not just wait until PayPal or another major payment processor supports funding via crypto and then you immediately have access to all Paypal-enabled vendors in the same way?  
To me, if you're willing to shuffle funds around, there are many options that then open up (eg. btc left on exchange-&gt;fiat-&gt;purchase).
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:28:10
Thanks, but this is actually worse than I had imagined.  This is the most convoluted solution I have seen to a simple problem.  I hope the dev team knows that it will take months and months for these networks to be established.  And what makes anyone believe that it will be widely used when the previous Segwit effort has still not been adopted? 
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:51:04
Apparently it's rooted in the hardware so there is no firmware solution.  I suspect that the vulnerability isn't straightforward to attack as initially Ledger said they needed something like 100k worth of hardware to perform the attack.  They then scaled things down to supposedly $100 worth of hardware and managed to retrieve the seed from the Trezor within an hour. 
Trezor basically have said that if you have a long passphrase (and keep your device physically safe) then this basically mitigates this attack.
For me, that's not a satisfactory answer given that your 24-word seed should be always safe on a hardware device without any caveats.  If it's not, then you should not be allowed to proceed to store your coins on the device until the minimum expected requirements are met.  Before this vulnerability, it was expected that your coins would be safe without a passphrase but to be extra safe you would add a passphrase.  From what they are saying now (but not publicizing nor enforcing) is that a passphrase is mandatory.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:17:13

So what do we use Bitcoin for?
@_date: 2019-07-01 11:46:37
The success of Bitcoin was due to it being crafted with economic incentives in mind.  I don't see why this should no longer apply.  If exchanges are not implementing all these "extras" then it means that from a business perspective it doesn't make sense and that is the open and free system that Bitcoin has been built on.
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:48:14
The developers have been schnorring alot while the mempool was overflowing... err.. Spammed.. Attacked... Used.  Whatever.  Effect was the same but as luck would have it it fixed itself!

The answer is whether you can afford to lose it.  If it goes to zero, will it change your life for the worse?  Also, set a profit target and/or timeframe before you buy so you understand what your exit strategy is.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:32:06
Don't mean to bearer of bad news but there is a [serious vulnerability]( that has been discovered by (all people) Ledger.  If you think seed extraction is a serious problem (I do), I believe EU law allows you 14 days to return the product.  
The Trezor official response to this issue is nothing short of negligient IMO and they are suggesting that you need to use a long passphrase to protect yourself against the attack.  That is, consider the 24-word seed completely useless if an attacker (colleague, acquaintance, thief, etc) gets a hold of your device for more than hour.  Your only fallback is the complexity of your additional passphrase and needs to be as unguessable as your seed.

So your vision of Bitcoin is a store of value and a limited medium of exchange?  I think that's a very limited view of where this technology could take us but it does seem like the Bitcoin project is not thinking that far ahead.
@_date: 2019-07-01 10:31:16
IMO you're deflecting a problem onto the users of the system for potentially short-term gain.  How much time are they realistically buying by going to Segwit?  No one knows.  If you are asking exchanges to do development work to alleviate network congestion, then it would make sense to at least propose in tandem, a longer-term solution that would resolve the base layer congestion problem.  Lightning IMO not only again deflects without resolving the root cause.  To boot, it is a *completely different* protocol you asking people to implement and utilize.  This took years of development to create and there is just no way to expect that exchanges are going to invest resources into this when there is no guarantee fees will not be exorbitant on the new layer.  Sure it's low now, but isn't this what Bitcoin proponents argue about other crypto networks that their fees are only low because they aren't being used?  Plus, you are never going to ever convert 100% of users to utilize this secondary layer.  Therefore, we are back to square 1 about how to ensure there is sufficient capacity for all users of the network.

There's a big difference between a newly released piece of software where there are reports of funds getting locked up, versus a system that's had 10 years of use and has an ecosystem of businesses, ATMs and exchanges around it.

You are running around in circles if you cared to do a [search before you posted](  This same question has been a revolving door for years.
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:50:50
You obviously just like dancing around so you don't need to answer your own questions. 
Lots of questions about Segwit of you do a simple Google search. 
As for LN, no one is even keen to have large amounts locked up it given that it's beta. 
[Article from April 2019]( 
*Kyle Torpey: Do you think it is safe for exchanges to integrate with the Lightning Network at this point? What sort of limits will you be imposing?*
*Trey Griffith: Everyone needs to do their own risk assessment. We have the Lightning Network recommended channel limits still in place of 0.16777215 BTC and 10.066329 LTC, and we have an additional limit of $2,500 USD equivalent per day. Users still need to do their own analysis of the risk that they are willing to take, but we’re comfortable with the risk we’re taking at those sizes.*
You expect an exchange to deal and  risk customers' assets when the maximum recommended amount to deal is 0.16BTC?  The thing is in beta and even the developers are advising that you don't try lock up large amounts in the network and yet you're saying we should chastize them for not using it? 
For goodness sake, use some common sense.
@_date: 2019-07-01 11:18:04
So again, back to square 1.  Exchanges don't implement it and mempool still clogged.  Apparently no other technical solution.. But, if we can lobby those lazy Bitstamp guys then the mempool will clear.

Did you have any anti-virus installed?  If so, any idea why it didn't pick it up?
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:39:44
This is a set if complex words (passphrase) that is *in addition* to your 24 word seed.  This is especially important with the Trezor because [there is a serious vulnerability]( that has been discovered that can expose your seed if people get physical access to your device.  The vulnerability has not been disclosed but apparently it is in the hardware itself which means exploits are almost inevitable.
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:47:22
Banks can move fast with entire departments dedicated to IT security.  Once the new standard is set, just give it a few months and they will complete an upgrade.
Security standards can be upgraded relatively fast.  The "recent" heartbleed bug was met with a concerted effort to patch the issue and roll things out pretty darn quickly. 
The same can't be said for a distributed bunch of developers who can't agree on simple things like block-sizes.
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:39:42
Sounds like a change in agenda.  What happened to "fighting the banks" and "decentralized money"?
@_date: 2019-07-06 07:10:28
Every hardware key should initialize with a new set of seed words.  Yes, they can be changed but if you have coins on the current seed you will need to pay fees to move them to the new seed.
@_date: 2019-07-06 08:10:25


I was always in two minds about open source when it comes to a device that holds funds like this.  On one had, yes, one can look at the code and make sure it's not doing anything bad.  On the other hand, it gives many hackers a deep insight into potential attack vectors.
I don't think this means it's safer at all.  In both open and closed source, a device that holds money is going to be be a high value target and if it's found, it wont be long before its public with stories of users losing their funds.
In the end it doesn't seem to matter for the Trezor issue because the problem seems rooted in their hardware.  It is absolutely not sufficient for Satoshi labs to say that their device is effectively useless without a passphrase.  This certainly wasn't the case before the exploit was found.
It certainly seems like Ledger is rubbing it in, but it also appears they have found numerous issues that I think Trezor should be glad were disclosed to them before a hacker actually did more brand damage.  I'm just wondering why their own teams aren't picking up the exploits themselves.  All I hope is that Ledger has done similar tests on their own stuff to harden their security.
@_date: 2019-07-01 10:40:22

@_date: 2019-07-01 11:04:47
Ha, it always comes to personal attacks when the questions get too hard, doesn't it?
So you've answered your own question there.  The exchanges have no incentive to do it and there's not much that can be done about it.  So do we all shake our fists or is there something else that can be done to solve the issue?  It's been like like this for years now with no end in sight.

I'm stunned that you would suggest naming and shaming the users.  If these users decide to fall in line with such a tactic, what happens when more people try to transact on the network causing it to get congested again?  Who's to blame after that?
@_date: 2019-07-02 01:18:04


Because that was the going rate to have a transaction confirmed without worrying about it getting stuck in the mempool (I had to RBF to get it unstuck).


While I intend to transact and the mempool can get clogged, yes.  The transaction I am referring to was done early 2018 and we still see the issue today.


No, not while the developers themselves are advising that you don't lock up more than 0.16 BTC in a channel because of the "risks".  I'll stick to technology that has been battle tested for 10 years if I'm moving anything but a few dollars.  If something goes wrong, there is no support to assist me so it's my responsibility to keep my funds safe.
@_date: 2019-07-18 09:39:22
I agree with you.  It's clear that the way to handle this is to ensure uptime of the system as a priority.  You can then design all the optimization techniques you want while the system remains useable.  Seems to me that there's more concern about balancing the economic factors, ensuring there are sufficient fees for the miners.  IMO it's something they're going to have to face at some point at it's better sooblner rather than later.

Dear u/SHIMINA14,
I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.
You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.
However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.
Yours truly,
Prince Alyusi Islassis

The question is how much did it cost to fund and finalize your account and every transaction in-between?  Percentage fees also give certainty - if you are doing a transaction for a $1 item, all these fees could work out to several times the transaction value.

It's a good thought but personally I don't think it's tenable long-term to pay $5, $15, $50 plus dollars (yes, I've paid $50 before) for a transaction that might never make it.  People are tolerating it by either leaving it on an exchange or justifying the cost because it's a long term speculative hold to make "big bucks".  I suppose that's fine if that's all you expect of Bitcoin.

Be extremely careful with this as the tax laws on certain countries can f you up as a result of BTC price movements.  If, for example, you earn 1 BTC when it is $10k and at the end of the tax year your BTC is only worth only $5k, you are still liable for tax on the $10k at the time you earned it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:58:49
Thank you for the article, but it is still extremely high-level and doesn't answer some of the main questions I have: 1) Does it require vendor support before it can be used (much like Segwit) and, if so, which vendors are onboard and 2) How does LN propose to commit information into a block when it is already completely full, or is the assumption that people will (somehow) immediately convert to LN when it is released?  This doesn't make sense to me as I expect that adoption (if any) would take months to materialize in the form of alleviating the congested blocks. 
While the technology itself might be interesting, the roadmap of execution is not clear.  The project team need to understand that this isn't just about technology.  It's about getting large interests involved so it doesn't end up poorly utilized like Segwit.  It seems like the team haven't learned from this and are still banking on the BTC community to beg vendors to push this idea through when it might not even be in their interests.

@_date: 2019-07-01 11:01:05
As I've mentioned in my other response, shaming people for not implementing Lightning - which has taken years to develop - is a bit rich, isn't it?  And if users aren't using it, then there really is no compelling reason to support it.
As for Segwit, again, surely if there was any incentive they would have implemented it by now?
The problem with all this is that while this standoff is occurring, Bitcoin will bleed users to other coins that have more fluid networks.  Perhaps they don't have the same volume as Bitcoin right now, but demonstrating that the base protocol has capacity means that there will be greater adoption for that platform in the longer term.  The Bitcoin network is going to have to solve this base layer problem at some stage and the only question is when and will it be too late?

Appreciate your level-headed response.  Agreed there is lots of rubbish out there, but you can't argue that there isn't already a solution out there which is a copy of the Bitcoin source code with a bigger block-size that should scale long enough for them to consider what to do next (if anything).  It's live and it's proven (because it's essentially Bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:01:39
I'm actually wondering whether this would have the effect of stemming a "bank run" in the end.  If people have their funds locked in their wallets rather than on the exchange, only a few will manage to sell in time.  The others might be late to the sell-off and therefore forced into a HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:00:16
Thanks again for your reply.  It was actually one of the most reasoned arguments I have seen on this topic.
I think my main thought on all of this is that crypto (and technology) is moving at a faster rate than ever before.  Bitcoin definitely has a first-starter advantage, but as the years roll by we of course know by the many great technologies (and technology companies) can and do become irrelevant.  I feel there is a window of time left before the stain on Bitcoin becomes permanent.  Before, it was just the threat of external forces that were a problem for Bitcoin.  Now I feel like it's coming from within.
Appreciate your input, it was great to hear your view!

Pretty poor example considering most Reddit users have some semblance of anonymity since the site is focused on information exchange rather than dealing in personal details such as photos, geo-location, relationships, phone numbers, sexual orientation, religious &amp; political persuasion and so forth.  
Sure Reddit could extrapolate some of this information but it is not at all in a format that is readily "mineable", valuable or sensitive as what Facebook has.  Not to mention, you ignore the entire history of Facebook which has an established modus operandi of data "leaks" and questionable business practices to track users to create a full profile of information without people's consent.

You may have mistaken me for a BCH advocate rather than someone trying to present a balanced argument.  Foe the record, I don't know about whether either has the ability to survive (or at least thrive) in the longer term. 
I agree - the few people that are spearheading the BCH charge are not the greatest representatives in my mind.  Partly because there has been such an ugly campaign against them, but also because it gives the impression that it's run by a very few - what happened to decentralization?  BTC can't nod their heads either given the current state of affairs.
What I *do* like about BCH is that there is a movement to bring back the development into the hands of the people by allowing voting of important issues which would break the division we are seeing with BTC.

Thanks for explaining your Ledger experience.  Let's hope that they've learned something from it.  Unless it's a critical patch, I would always upgrade my firmware after the masses have done so to see if it's safe. 
As for Trezor, yes, the exploit apparently requires physical access but be reminded that the attack supposedly takes less than an hour.  This effectively means that you can't ever leave it unattended without fear of it being compromised.  The worst of it is that it appears to be a fundamental hardware issue which means hackers have all the time in the world to figure out how it was done and start selling/distrubuting this knowledge.  After that, I wouldn't be using a Trezor to hold coins no matter how secure my additional passphrase is.

The difference with IOTA is that it's the foundations for networked economy, not just a human currency which is why their wallet is clunky.  There are now several wallets in development and due for release in Jan.

It's always a question of 'when', unfortunately.  BCH has made some impressive inroads into awareness of the problem that BTC has with their development processes.  You can't in good conscience allow users to use a system that is hobbling along indefinitely and people are seeing that.
BTC 's fortunes now rest on a continual growth cycle to attract people to it because there is no other value-add - even the appeal of being a 'store of value' is being eroded due to fees.

It's clear that Trump's statements on Bitcoin revolve around propping up the dwindling significance of the USD.  For the first time, people who have been shut out of the financial system based on US's say-so can now again participate freely.  The fact that China, Russia and Iran (and potentially other countries) are seeking to use crypto to bypass strangleholds on the current system is an obvious concern that would threaten USD's reserve status.  It also means that US is now going to need to think twice when they decide to print more USD to bail themselves out of bankruptcy in the next GFC.

The best way I found is to do a "white light" meditation with an audio guide along with binaural beats (look this up - scientifically proven).
The narrator essentially starts by going through each individual and very specific part of your body from top to bottom and encourages you to relax these parts and visualize "white light" coming into them.  You wouldn't believe what sort of tension exists in these various parts until you are consciously told to relax them.  
It takes around 30 minutes and at first you will not be able to focus but don't worry - practice makes perfect.  When you get the hang of it, you will start feeling rushes of euphoria as you imagine the light passing through your body like a circuit.
It's one of the one things you need to put on your bucket list and probably the most easiest!

The problem I have is that no solution is being offered.  All the ones on offer apparently require *other* people to move their butts and incur development costs to support it.  That is not a solution.  When Bitcoin was the only option, it made sense that it could dictate terms.  Now, however, why should a software product, exchange, vendor (etc) support a new technology change if it doesn't pass a cost-benefit analysis? There are viable and proven alternatives out there right now as we speak that already adhere to common standards.
Not to mention, it doesn't give a overly good impression that anyone would let their core product wither away while there are simple and proven solutions to buy time until the rest of the industry have time to look at your new whiz-bang stuff.

This.  It is pretty much becoming untenable now to move funds which means even as a "store of value", Bitcoin is now becoming worthless.

It is completely debatable about who is technically superior over Linux vs Windows but I think the popularity of Windows can be accounted for because of it's accessibility and development platforms.

There's apparently an unfixable vulnerability with Trezors that the Ledger team have discovered.  It can potentially affect you if you want to protect yourself against people who might gain physical access to your device (flat-mates, colleagues, etc).  The vulnerability details have not been made public however I would assume it's a matter of time before someone works it out (and, if Ledger wanted to play dirty, they could leak it). 
Trezor's response has simply been to say that "as long as your passphrase is very complex, you should be alright".

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:47:54
Thank you for your reply.  First up, please don't take any of my responses personally.  I like to have a good exchange on this topic since it's not often discussed as openly as it should be (without heated emotions getting in the way).
Regarding the vendor support: If Lightning requires this, then surely we already know the future since Segwit has apparently not penetrated to any effect.  This seems to negate the argument of the Game Theory working in favor of BTC because 1) people have small sums of coins on legacy addresses that they cannot move due to high fees  (which I believe is the case) and 2) When users finally manage to incur the expense of "unlocking" their coins, they are likely to move their wealth into another stable crypto-currency with lower fees and more fluid (of which there are at least 2 which would fit this bill).  This essentially means that Bitcoin is left with the few of the few users who are holding the coin as a store of value.  I don't feel like this sort of a Bitcoin has lived up to it's promise and it's certainly not the one that I would be using over the next x months of I had the choice. 
You also mention decentralization. If you think about why this was a desirable attribute, it was so no country could ban or curtail Bitcoin's use.  Over some 8 years we have established that if there is any regulation, it will come in the form of laws (such as KYC or outright bans) rather than some attack on the network (blocking IP's, etc).  So from this perspective, almost all other altcoins are subject to the same restrictions of BTC, regardless of how "decentralized" the architecture is (and of course, some argue that LN is more centralized since you can start taking specific hubs offline).  So, if there ever was a reason to go to such lengths to "decentralize" at the expense of usability, I feel this was a real poor use of time.  
The development team, to me, just don't seem to get that they are losing traction as a universal payment method.  Or perhaps they are content to tend to the elite interests.

Thanks for your insight and I know exactly what you're saying about the dips because I've seen them.  Is this time different though?  Before we had a functional system and now we have something broken.  
These are fundamentals of the system that surely need to be upheld for Bitcoin to retain value.  For one, you need to be able to transact fluidly.  As someone who has held for so long, a $30+ transaction fee may be insignificant compared to how much profit you made.  However, how can someone has just entered the market justify that cost?  Bitcoin was to bank the un-banked and all that jazz.  If it's not getting new capital inflow, then you are just relying on deflationary pressure to hopefully retain value.  That, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the development (and competitors, etc) means we have a few more variables to consider than before. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:44:25
And you don't consider the current situation where the miners have got BTC over a barrel with fees and difficulty adjustments as being centralized? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:05:14
I have big doubts whether the core devs have done any serious comparisons given the state of the network. It's like they're off doing a university research development project. 
I see the best outcome being that Bitcoin usage starts to dwindle, causing fees to go down and then subsequently the price will pump at the release of LN (whenever that happens) following around 3 months for you to get out of your position at a high before everyone realizes they forgot to push their new shit onto the exchanges and wallet developers (just like Segwit).  After that, Bitcoin will be in a definitive death spiral because all hope would be lost.  
Bitcoin seems to be becoming a high-risk long term play like investing in a new coin which hasn't completed its development yet.  At $16k a coin, that's a scary thought. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:00:55

Adoption has a lot to do with the success of any technology - not just who bought in.  Microsoft of all people would know this lesson by now. 
While I agree that Bitcoin's only hope for survival is to think big, they need widespread adoption.  It's hard to believe Microsoft has the ability to reverse the funk - they haven't been at the forefront of defining any cutting-edge technology in many years.

Hi everyone.  I created this account specifically to say:
1) I have tested my account credentials with a fake login/pass on btc-e.nz and it correctly fails.
2) The btc-e.nz domain appears to have a valid certificate (make sure this is also the case with you before proceeding!)
3) I have tried to log in with correct credentials and it works as expected.  The btc-e.nz website forces a password change immediately.
4) Once I have changed the password, I can confirm that my account reflects the real amounts I had prior to the site going down (i.e. this is unlikely to be a phishing scam).
Of course, please don't blindly take the word of a newly created account.  Please proceed with all the necessary caution.
I, however, am convinced that this is the real-deal and I'm hopeful of what's next.  The admins are answering questions in the chat box (Russian only) and seem to indicate that they are proceeding as planned (see Twitter notices).

@_date: 2018-06-24 04:01:51
One difference is with Keepass is that you get to choose exactly where your passwords will exist if you decide to put them in the cloud.  As I mentioned in another response, keeping this information as private as possible means someone will need to specifically target you.  This, as opposed to LastPass which is undoubtedly having attempts to penetrate them as we speak. 
The difference also is that if a person targets you specifically, it will be up to them to try hack your master key and your information is unlikely to be worth anything on the darknet unless you are person of interest.  When there's a general hack however, this information inevitably gets leaked so you have the whole underworld trying to hack your master key and the stakes are much higher.

What you're describing is not a technical security mechanism but a political one.  If it's only politics that protecting it from attacks then I have no doubt that it will be exploited at some stage.  "Uprisings" are meaningless if they aren't enforced in the code.  If a mining group decides a particular outcome, that's it.  What else can people actually do aside from shake their fists and create a hard fork?  
You have to assume that a global monetary system that potentially usurps the power of governments and existing financial structures *will* be attacked at whatever weak points there are.
@_date: 2019-06-05 10:21:21
Miners can do a similar attack on BTC if around 3-4 pools decide to "collude" on an outcome.
@_date: 2019-06-09 01:09:47
That's a great vision which is spoiled by knowing that if you want to transact on the system you are not priority unless you're willing to pay whatever fees are dictated to you.  That's the current state of Bitcoin and if Lightning is Bitcoin, then why should it be any different?
@_date: 2019-08-23 21:31:18
I understand why you wouldn't want to use Bitpay due to their business practices but what you say doesn't make business sense.  Why not directly accept credit cards instead of using a third-party payment processor?  And bank deposits, foreign currencies, etc?  Because it's a lot of work to accept, process and convert all these payment methods just so you can get paid in your native currency.
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:26:05
This part of the equation is totally untested.  I also question how sustainable this will be in the future.  There's an obvious contention between miners' profitability and people who want to transact cheaply.  If LN were to become popular, then what's the incentive for miners once the block reward is gone?
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:23:48
Maybe it's their additional costs to be able to do anything with the BTC once they receive it.  They're working on tight margins and small value transactions after all.  Bit of a clusterf to think about all these fees if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-06-23 11:13:36
Did you try turning in off and on again?
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:27:53
Yeah, but then miners get less fees to pay their bills, so security decreases as they switch off their rigs.  Bit of a catch-22.
@_date: 2019-06-01 12:23:04
Trezor is open-source at least.
@_date: 2019-06-05 08:52:17
The question is *why*?  Why would they support all these extra tack-on "solutions" such as Segwit and LN  that are trying to solve the fee problems?  What's the value-add? 
Once you have moved your coins from BTC to a Lightning channel, how is this  different to changing into another low-fee coin and making the payment?  
Simplicity is absolutely paramount if you want people to use your payment system.
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:22:31
There's a 1% payment fee for processing the payment (usually payment providers can charge up to 8% for this).  This is to cover business operational costs and obviously factors in a profit.  The additional fee is clearly something to offset the transfer of BTC.  Just think about it: On a $15 transaction they are taking a paltry 15 cents to facilitate this transaction!  How can they absorb the several dollars they will be charged to subsequently move their BTC? According to their website, they can eliminate exposure to price movements which logically means they need to convert it into fiat within a reasonable time-frame (max 1 day), otherwise they will be exposed to the price movements.  This means that any customers who have opted for fiat payment would need to have their funds swept regularly.

LN is a secondary layer to Bitcoin.  So I can understand that you hold the keys when funding a channel but after that?  As I understand, it's only if you are running your own node you have the keys, otherwise the node is custodian? 
The dev team mentioned that you can lose coins as well.  How does this happen?  Is that if the node goes offline/missing and doesn't close the channel?

I think that's true for both Bitcoin and the other one(s) you're referring to.  No individual runs a mining rig these days as it's a waste of time.  Only big operations that have access to cheap electricity are in this game.  It's far from ideal what has happened - everything is centralized in China where they're now discussing curtailing Bitcoin miners.  The show might go on without them, but this just increases the potential risk that players in China (state owned or otherwise) could disrupt the system.  If not that, then the prized hash rate will drop markedly, ending up in less security.

Yes, we've all heard of this block size debate.  
Given that only large interests can perform a 51% attack, it is much up to whether it's in their interest to do so. As we've also seen, Bitcoin has been the coin that has been mainly subject to this sort of takeover challenges due to its high profile.  While everyone may have run a full node, this was going to be futile against these large interests.  The only thing that has stopped the most recent takeover attempt was to appeal to the interests involved) and waste months of valuable time with no dev progress).  I chalk it up as a positive notch for community consensus around Bitcoin but certainly nothing to do with the extra "security" in the code or ecosystem.

I can tell you that although I loved the original Bitcoin, I will not be using it.  The current situation with fees and congestion to force people onto a new fee-making layer 2 is contemptuous to the Bitcoin userbase.  How is anyone supposed to trust a new "solution" (of several that have been pushed over the years) is not going to end up in the same sh.tfest?   There are too many commercial conflicts of interest in this ecosystem now.
@_date: 2019-06-04 10:28:33
Sorry but you've joined a cult.  BTC is for hodling only.  Over a year ago I tried to move some Bitcoin and had to pay around $50.  There's no on-chain solution in sight which simply means finding alternative coins if you want to do business.  Why would anyone do extra jiggery-pokery to put their coins onto a secondary layer like Lightning so they can be rogered by yet more fees on not one network but two?   How can you trust a system that's being managed in a way that  rips you off more than the banks?

You Bitcoin sounds irretrievably lost, sorry to say.  You may want to trace how this happened.  As I recall, there was a trojan BCH wallet (Electrum?) which swept the coins immediately when you put your private key in.  If you hadn't moved your BTC before you attempted to claim your BCH, then the thieves would have swept this as well.

As long as there is organic demand in the form of long-term holders then this will only cause short-term fluctuations.  The important thing to note is that if there's a discrepancy in the futures price versus the actual underlying, you can "easily" exercise your right to purchase.  This is different to many futures markets right now such as gold which can be manipulated since people don't know exactly how much physical asset is actually backing the future.  Plus, if you ever decided to exercise a gold future, you would be committing to purchasing physical gold which you"d need to figure out how to store (not to mention it is not a liquid asset).

Good analogy with the nuclear reactor.  I have read a number of threads and articles about people improving the code but apparently not feeling like they're welcome to contribute.  One guy had identified how to make major optimizations in the Bitcoin wallet and yet I don't think any of it was incorporated.  I feel there is an element of pride mixed with "we want to proceed cautiously" which seems to have paralyzed the release effort.  If, for example, the DAA code on Bitcoin Cash worked, would it be incorporated in Bitcoin Core?  
Other Bitcoin/crypto strains seem to be moving forward with regular releases but I just don't see any significant moves on BTC.  I can understand not trying to push through things unnecessarily, but there is also a responsibility to protect the uptime of the network as a priority.  I think the fees and lag have done significant brand damage and yet everyone knew this day would one day approach. 
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:31:55
How does it help to force both the payer and payee onto yet another network?  Assuming Bitpay open a channel (fee!) and then payer opens one (fee) and then pays the bill (smaller fee), then Bitpay will likely need to convert this to USD in some timely fashion by closing the channel (fee) and then transferring to an exchange (fee) and then selling it (exchange fees).  What's left pf the original payment? Complete highway robbery all the way through.  It's clear a bunch of tech boffins designed this instead of people that do business.

I agree with the border-less nature but that goes for almost every crypto-currency being created now in the top 10 market cap.  Many  competitors have additional privacy, seamless &amp; cheap (even free) transactions.  Sure, Bitcoin has got head start but that doesn't guarantee anything 5+ years down the road.  The fees are a deal-killer as far as I figure because it's hurting adoption &amp; use.  Worse, is that I'm not sure that the development team is agile enough to compete.  Understandably they are trying to play things safe, but I'm not sure how this will pan out once people have it in their heads that they can't use Bitcoin for anything aside from hoarding.  It's already happening if you look at the discussions on how to move money around - use ETH, BCH or LTC.  Many on this subreddit will suggest you do this and to "rack off with yer FUD" in denial of how this harms BTC's 7 year effort to raise profile and encourage people to use it.
u/Anonximous asks a legitimate question - if the value doesn't keep on going up, speculators just pull out their funds and allows the price to stagnate or even collapse.  What value proposition does Bitcoin then give?  There's a lot of computing power being used to keep the lights on just so people can "store value" out of the government's reach (which I think is also an illusion because monetary movements can be monitored since the block-chain is completely transparent).

Thanks for your reply.  I think the answer is that Bitcoin has definitely shown the possibilities and now it's time for version 2.  I personally don't see this as being the Lightning Network because not only is it adding additional hops and fees, the biggest problem I have is trust that the system will be managed in a way that is in the users' interests.
For this reason, I'm hoping that the number of other projects that are out there eliminate these conflicts-of-interest (eg. with miners, etc) and congestion as this is the next logical step to allow people to openly transact using crypto-currency.

Isn't this exactly what can happen with Lightning?  I believe a Watch Tower can lose yoir coins if it goes down and they can recover it for (surprise!) another fee?


It's one thing to ask a vendor to implement stuff but when you also ask the payer to do extra things you're just raising the bar for entry.
Segwit should be a good example of the likely uptake of any new systems.  The devs are asking businesses and people to move coins to Segwit addresses but firstly asking exchanges, wallets, etc need to add support for this.  This takes time and there's little incentive when the root problem of fees/network capacity is not solved.  Plus, you can't fault them for not wanting to do this when the development path hasn't been clear for years now and the basic network problems have still not been alleviated.  Why? 
To use Lightning, you still need to compete with a huge backlog of transactions to open your channel.  To me, the whole setup is completely disrespectful to the user experience and moves away from why Bitcoin originally became popular: Simplicity.

That quote is quite relative.  If your life savings are $200 then it really isn't a steal.  In some countries, bank deposits are government backed so in this case, what are you "securing" it from?

Paypal is a special case IMO.  I have no idea how they actually survive with the thieving they do.
That said, this whole crypto thing has forced banks to up their game.  None of the banks I do business with take longer than a day to do a transfer and at no charge at all.  Although yes, it depends exactly where you are sending to but international fees are on par with what you'd pay with Bitcoin.  Plus, I am fully confident of the transfer taking place and that I have some recourse if there is a problem.  With Bitcoin however, my heart is pounding making any transfer greater than 1k.  Did I send to the right address?  Has a virus tampered with the sending address?  Have I put the correct fee?  What's the current mempool like?
To me, these are absurd questions to have to ask yourself.  If this is the cost for "being your own bank", you really need to determine whether the average person is going to see the benefits...  And what are the benefits?  That you stick it to Jamie Dimon?  
At the end of the day, I am starting to build the same resentment for the custodians of the Bitcoin ecosystem that I would be held hostage to wildly varying fees to move my own funds.

If you read of some of the attacks on Wifi, you'd be best off trying to  secure that as well.  It's an art in itself.  
For that matter, anything connected to the internet should be considered tainted.  I've read of all sorts of attacks such as TeamViewer exploits, keyloggers, trojan wallets and so forth.
I think the general rule is that there's no such thing as being too careful.  Check everything 10 times and then again.  Keep your virus checker up to date.

I think there's a bit of bubble but also there is a hedging aspect here.  At the moment, the only way to hedge against the inflation of fiat currencies is by buying futures in something like gold.  Unfortunately we know that these paper markets are being manipulated.  In the case of Bitcoin, you have a tamper-proof enforced limit of issued currency which naturally makes the currency deflationary, causing upward pressure in its price.  This makes it an ideal asset since it has proven to be secure and it is easily stored (especially compared to physical gold).  I think once the market is saturated, the price will find an equilibrium somewhere, but I don't think it will be zero (unless the underlying infrastructure fails).  I think this is an age where people have reasons not to trust that their governments and banks will act responsibly to keep their assets safe.  For that reason, many are inclined to put their money in another asset that is still liquid &amp; accessible (ignoring the fee debate ;).

The more I read into this situation, the more aggravated I get thinking about it.  Why is it that there is not one thread in the front page of r/Bitcoin discussing the urgency of the capacity situation?  Instead we have millionaires, memes and how to destroy the destroyers. 
Post-fork, it is a possibility that the Core chain chokes and dies.  In this case, it will be a race to get your coins out and sold before a crash in price.  Ironically, the only thing that may prevent a major 24hr price drop is that many will not be able to move their coins onto an exchange due to the network being clogged.  
I don't want to see Bitcoin burn, but it seems to me that people here are more content with stomping their feet and changing their Twitter handle than asking why we're here in the first place and offering some practical solutions.  To me it just highlights the *need* for a major event like to break the status quo and make people understand again that the proper function of the network is the utmost priority and ultimately in everyone's best interest. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:42:36

I agree with this statement.  The fiasco is that no one is making an urgent decision to rectify a system that clearly can't cope with the transaction activity.  This should be absolutely priority one and unfortunately I can't see any debate here on how to make it happen.  If there was the same amount of talk about this rather than lobbying against people who are trying to force through a solution, then I would be rallying with you.
It's not good enough to propose solutions that are months/years away.  If increasing the block-size is the easiest &amp; most reliable way of stabilizing the system in the short term, then let's do it.  Then it can be subsequently upgraded to the super-duper whatever network in whatever future time-line there is.

- Tether issues USDT through their own authority.
- They have provided no transparency around their actual cash holdings and whether they hold the amount of cash they are issuing as USDT. 
- The last "audit" (which wasn't really an official audit but a bank statement) showed that their cash holdings aren't anywhere near the USDT they are holding.
- The USDT is stated clearly in their terms and conditions that USDT is effectively not worth anything.  It cannot be redeemed and there is effectively no legal recourse if someone is left with USDT when the music stops.
- They are incorporated in BVI (and apparently their CFO has said that they need to do a 'cat and mouse' game to hide their accounts).
To extrapolate further, what stops them from continuing to issue USDT unimpeded and cashing them in for real USD?  To me this is the perfect crime and anyone who assumes the best of these guys in an unregulated market like crypto... well, let's just say that we've had enough real-world scenarios where we know how this typically ends.
To me, the thread [here]( starts off all wrong by trying to undermine the guy who's spreading 'FUD'.  I think there are some legitimate concerns here.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:32:04
I think that's the problem here.  Idealism is trumping pragmatism.  There is a technical issue with Bitcoin's usability right now - first priority is to fix it.  Instead, we seem to be off on a R&amp;D exercise to build a rocket when all we need to do is go down the road.
I have full respect for the developers but this isn't solely a R&amp;D exercise any more.  I think a responsible way forward is for the devs to give clear choices on the short-term (2-3 months max) and longer term solution to the address capacity issue.  Someone (non dev) then needs to orchestrate pushing this through because in the dev-world there is always a debate on how it could have been done better.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:41:53

The marketing is all about "Bitcoin" at the moment and most people aren't aware of all the flavors.  From an longer-term investment perspective, it's safer to stick with the masses.  That said, if there is any bad publicity regarding the fork or people being unable to transact, we could see some sort of shift.  After all, we are seeing this already with Bitcoin not being utilized for purchases anymore but instead seen as a store of value.  It's anyone's guess where people would go if there was a critical shift due to loss of confidence in the system.  The most likely candidates/competitors are BCH or Ethereum but don't forget that they have some ground to cover to get the same form of institutional interest that only comes with proven "stability" (which includes security of the system).  If Bitcoin somehow survives this shit storm and fixes its woes, then it's going to be better for it.  Only time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:21:01
What is the short-term solution to the transaction bottle-neck we are seeing?  Why is it that people need to force through a solution in this way?  I'm not a fan at all about how S2X is being pushed through but no one seems to have any alternative.  If we are talking about Wall Street entering the market in the coming months, this whole thing will grind to a halt and give a pretty crappy impression to all the new-comers about how useful Bitcoin really is.  There are a lot of other options available now in the crypto-currency space.  There's no guarantee of Bitcoin's future unless it can deal with network &amp; technical problems in an honest and responsible way that benefits the users (shareholders).
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:08:51
The problem with the gold price is that it is being manipulated by the big institutions, much like all the interest rate and other scams they have been perpetuating.  This is because no one trades in actual physical gold where there is a truly limited supply.  Instead, they issue paper notes (futures, etc) which don't necessarily reflect actual supply. 
In the case of Bitcoin, this is not as easy.  If futures are traded, it's easy for a person to ask for delivery of the "good" because delivery is easy and storage not a problem.  It is also easy to audit whether the issuer of the Bitcoin futures contract actually has possession of the deliverable.  In the case of gold, there is much dispute whether there are gold reserves to cover the issued contract.  As no one tends to ask for gold delivery, there is no one to crash the scheme.

Thanks, but I have a real problem with this thread since it starts off trying to discredit the author of the reports.  Whether or not he is reputable does not change these facts:
- Tether issues USDT through their own authority.
- They have provided no transparency around their actual cash holdings and whether they hold the amount of cash they are issuing as USDT. 
- The last "audit" (which wasn't really an official audit but a bank statement) showed that their cash holdings aren't anywhere near the USDT they are holding.
- The USDT is stated clearly in their terms and conditions that USDT is effectively not worth anything.  It cannot be redeemed and there is effectively no legal recourse if someone is left with USDT when the music stops.

@_date: 2019-06-06 00:33:27
Well put.  I just think that this hasn't played itself out fully yet.  Bitcoin developers should recognize that there is a weakness there and should seek to close it.  I think the fact that Ethereum are looking to do this shows some forward thinking.  In the casr of Bitcoin the tact seems to be not to rock the boat and keep the miners happy with fees.  There nay come a stage though such as if the fees are reduced or unprofitable that they look elsewhere and that would put security at risk.  Unfortunately the model doesn't guarantee that hash rate will always increase.

Isn't it odd to you that there is no timeline for this?  If this were happening to any other 100 million dollar system, people would have a solution out by now to fix it.  I'm starting to think conspiracy theories here because this is just seems intentional.  What do the others (Roger, etc) know that they are willing to do stuff that's surely risking jail time to take down a competitor's network?  And why are the owners of this network sitting idly by when there has been ample opportunity deploy a solution?

That actually works both ways for Bitcoin:  The more fiat currency/debt is issued, a portion of that will flow into Bitcoin.  If the there is a stock market crash, people go straight for a safe haven.  For the first time since the last crash in 2008, they have a place to store wealth without having to resort to market that is easily manipulated by the big banks &amp; institutional dealers (i.e. Gold futures markets).

Sorry not to join in on the circle-jerk, but since when is letting a system get crippled by fees and latency a "smart solution". There are so many tech-heads in this game now talking about block-sizes that they have lost sight of ensuring this ecosystem continues to thrive and is actually a viable alternative to the current financial cartels.  Right now, it is not and no matter how clever future fixes might be, I see a lot of dumbness in the inaction over the past few months.  A project is not just about technology - it's about responsibility to all the stakeholders.  To leave users in such a situation where they need to use alternative cryptos to transact has been a mismanagement of the highest order and I think we will see people continue to move away while the risk of congestion is still there. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:34:11
Bitcoin project team would like to thank you all for your thoughts and prayers over the last few months to help solve this issue. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:43:09
The problem I have is that this discussion is totally in the realm of the technically proficient.  If Bitcoin is serious about mainstream adoption, it needs to be able to focus on the actual operation of the network rather than the technical details.  If there is an operational issue it absolutely trumps all other concerns in the immediate instance.  After that, you can unwind any technical debt knowing your users continue to feel confident about utilizing your system. 
Recently (and for many weeks) fees were extremely high and this had a knock-on effect of causing transaction confirmations to be completely uncertain (and untenable for a payment system). There has seemingly been little urgency to fix it despite it having been forthcoming for many months now (some would argue years).  That is not acceptable and I think it's fair to say with the dropping dominance in BTC, the market agrees.  There are just too many viable alternatives now that can compete in terms of security, reliability and quick response times when issues occur.

Just thought I'd chip in here.  I really think that this thread is malicious and unhelpful to the developers of Coinomi.  As a developer, there's nothing worse than people shitting on your work and trying to bring you down.  It's clear the "rep" from Coinomi is socially inept here but that should not count towards the assessment of the software's usability.  
It's easy to say that a developer should be putting this particular item ahead in the dev queue, but realistically it doesn't seem the utmost priority and there is no reason why it should be prioritized as a "Sev 1" bug.  Money is not being lost but yes, it's not great that (inclined) people can snoop on what you're doing.  There also could be further assessments being made internally about how to best approach the issue.  Yes, they should have communicated it back to the person who raised the issue, but we've already established that they have problems communicating.  Yes, it should be an easy fix - much more easier for someone to sit there on the sidelines and give advice than to go through the actual execution which involves release planning and making sure you really don't f something up in a rush to push out a fix.
From the thread here, it looks like there are reasons for not publishing the latest source:
I really don't like how people act like a pack of wolves when they take exception to one person.  With a bit of luck, this Coinomi "rep" might have learned some social skills from his exchange (and hopefully some appreciation that some people are here to help).  Until then, I think users should put away their pitchforks and focus on the issue at hand.  Ask them if they can give some timelines for a fix if the issue makes the software untenable for your use.
P. S. I do not use this software but took notice when these posts seem to be propping up everywhere on my Bitcoin reading.

It is obvious that few here are traders, let alone *day*traders.  It doesn't matter what time-frame you are trading, you would always have a stop-loss.

When you find yourself with empty pockets having to clean dishes at McDonalds, the only thing you'll get here is "Sorry for your loss, dude".  Can you take that to the bank?
A serious trader should be blocking this bullshit out and objectively have set a stop-loss to preserve their capital.

That's what gets me about this forum.  The assumption is that in 10 years it will be worth a bazillion bucks.  Perhaps it may, or perhaps it may not.  There are many factors that put the future of BTC at risk - regulation/banning being just one of the few.

Agreed. Use open source software that is well tested. I saw users complaining that they had lost coins after an Exodus hang/crash. As much as I like the interface, it seems the whole thing (closed source, emphasis on UI with less mention of security) means it is good for small amounts of coins only.

Don't you get it?  The morons behind B2X think they *are* Bitcoin.  This means that there are *no new coins* dropping from the heavens.  According to them, they are just upgrading the system.
This means that all you get from this "fork" is the possibility of creating a clusterf*** if you try to support both chains.  As for getting some extra coins, if you are willing to risk your holdings, you can try the hot-jiggery that Bitmex suggested of moving your coins around so they fork.  If you happen to do something wrong along the way (or god-forbid there's a bug in the stuff the B2X guys are writing), then say goodbye to your investment.
I personally would not be trusting any exchange that says they are supporting both chains.  When have they had time to test any of this stuff (or even been properly engaged about it)?  You don't put changes into a trillion dollar software system without getting everyone involved on-board.
EDIT:  Having said that, if there is a way of forking your coins, I would be dumping them on the few exchanges that support B2X and cashing out as quick as I can by converting to USD or altcoin and heading for the hills.

I don't think you can assume that they would deal with this issue at a drop of a hat unless it was proven to cause monetary loss.  As a company releasing free software, they surely will need to manage whatever developers they have and prioritize this amongst other work that keeps them afloat.  That, and putting pressure on them to make a release could cause something really unpleasant to happen.  That's what this Coinomi rep is trying to say with his baby words.
Don't get me wrong, I really think you've done a great service - Bitcoin stuff always need to be reviewed like this.  Similarly, there is a ton more work that's goes into developing and managing a free software product, so I think there needs to be some credit and appreciation that it might require some time (more than 11 days) to figure out what they need to do in the context of their business (eg. other higher priority work-items, cash-flow, etc). 
 Their handling of you and the situation is a different issue..  At least you gave Coinomi not only a bug report but a free lesson on "Responding on Social Media 101".  ;)
Just bear in mind that when you now do a Google search for 'Coinomi' all these Reddit threads pop up which will undoubtedly make users think twice about using the software long after they might decide to fix this issue.  I don't think that's overly fair if they've had a good track record of keeping users' funds safe - this is ultimately number one priority since many Bitcoin services/software can't even get this right yet.

Understand the comparative use case: I have some cash in my bank account and would like to move it internally.  Bank will charge me nothing for this. 
As for the fee, yes I understand it costs $5 per transaction.  For privacy, if I wanted to do these in separate transactions it will cost me lost. This use-case obviously applicable for a bank because there's no such thing as privacy - +1 for Bitcoin in that respect but it's going to cost me for that privilege.

Thanks for the input.  I really feel that the technical side needs some proper representation - that is, someone who has the art of speaking.  Developers are passionate and unfortunately their tone comes off oblivious to the other concerns that are entirely valid.  That is, you have a complex series of players in this game now along with lots of money at stake.  You need to balance the development risks with the practicality of making sure the ecosystem doesn't die.  I think all parts of the system are ultimately important and I hope that Bitcoin somehow remains true to its purpose of creating freedom for its users.

My original post is asking what there is to look forward to.  Your reply is effectively to look elsewhere.  A take-it-or-leave it response is supposed to promote growth of Bitcoin (and people's investment)?  I'm sure that's not the official response. 
As for whether the banks are offering it, they soon will be since they're all clambering onboard... But of course with their own solutions.  Where is Bitcoin going to fit in if we're content with fees and slow confirmation times?  Who cares if it is borderless if it's too expensive to use?  Who would use it to avoid censorship over other coins that are superior at masking other important transactional details?  Who would use it to transact if there are other solutions that transact quicker (and yes, it's transactional speed is extremely important in finance!)  Is it only another mechanism for the rich to store their wealth?
These are all genuine questions I am trying to ask to see if I can understand what lies ahead for Bitcoin.  I value feedback that helps me understand this more.

No withdrawls yet.  The admins are drawing up FAQs and time-lines here:   (Make sure you click on the Russian language flag and you will need to Google translate it).
In this FAQ, they have said withdrawals will be enabled "within a few days" of launching the site.  They have kept pretty tightly to their original timelines since the start of this saga so I am hopeful.
What's even more promising is that I believe (from the admin chatbox) that it will not require any verification to access any crypto.  I also believe that any withdrawal fees will be suspended for the moment.  Of course, we will need to wait and see what the exact terms are.

This will continue to go full circle until we stop talking technical and start appreciating the economic realities of what we are trying to displace.  You cannot conduct business on the *estimation* of a fee, especially if these fees are significant and can vary depending on immeasurable/"un-forecastable" technical parameters.  If I were to be selling a $30-$100 item, I would prefer know the fee upfront in order to make a reliable forecast of whether my business (and payment model) is viable.  Other competitors can either offer me a lower fee or a set percentage processing fee, so why not use them?  I'm not about to use a payment model that costs me dearly just for the sake of looking cool.  Again, let's use the "Jamie Dimon" method about evaluating an argument. If Jamie stands there and says "I don't know how much of a fee I will charge you today, it depends on how much my data throughput is" or even better "it depends on the current interest rate on my Lamborghini loan", are you going to base your business on it or will you choose something else that works for you?

Hi George - Thanks for the response.  Re: *"I didn't quite get how my 'communication problems' are related to this issue"*, I think that's what everyone is thinking here.  Why are you deviating from your company's core business by having protracted, off-topic discussions with people *under your company account*?  
I think the whole saga has escalated through a two-way contribution.  Now you can't expect much from random people on the internet, but surely you can expect that a company CEO will respond appropriately and know when they're trailing off-topic?  
If someone reports an issue, it would have just sufficed to say that "thanks, we're already looking at this" (or whatever is applicable and to-the-point).  You can't assume that these people have a detailed understanding of your back-log and processes (or even care), so don't bother citing them.  If they continue to harass after this and you feel you need to respond, I would keep it as terse and professional (i.e. polite and on-topic) as possible.
It seems highly odd to me as a CEO that you would have a drawn-out discussions that don't even relate to your software (and also continuing to escalate the situation with unspecified threats such as (quote) "*Several lines have been crossed here and all involved parties should be prepared to accept the consequences of their actions.*") . How can you possibly think this would be viewed favorably by your (prospective) users?  Why would you care about random people on the internet?  Do you think Luke the "researcher" will weigh heavily on your user-base?  He has around 300 followers (maybe many extra as a result of this thread).  I put "researcher" in quotes because Luke put a credible analysis &amp; issue report forward, only to lose that credibility when he degraded into taunting and responding just like you.  What possible positive outcomes are there for your company from engaging him further?  It seems he at least something to gain which is a bit of a profile and more followers.  And you?
 
I understand how you may take it as an affront to have people negatively view your software, especially when you invest so much time and energy into it.  It seems, however, you need to distinguish between those who are providing genuine help and feedback (eg. issue reports, rightfully flagging you as no longer open source) vs those who are just have a bone to pick (as this thread).  
I think most people are extremely supportive of free software (open source or not).  Please keep this in mind next time you are responding to someone on the internet... and if you really can't help yourself, use an anonymous account.  Although it'll be pretty obvious it's you, at least it won't show up in searches for 'Coinomi'.
Best of luck and credit to you for providing free software!

No disrespect here, but this is the sort of tech talk that a majority of people are zoning out of.  There's no red herrings in my mind with regard to fees.  If I pay a fee to Visa, then I don't care how much data I am moving.  I just care that they took x dollars/currency from me to perform the transaction.  As for the currency it is expressed in, I will end up doing the comparison in a standardized currency - USD being the most logical.  If Visa charges me less to do a transaction than Bitcoin, then why wouldn't I use it? 
When it comes to moving money around in my bank, there is absolutely no fee. It's these sorts of comparisons that make sense to everyday people for everyday transactions.  I feel that this is often getting lost in all the technical debate that is going on.

I wouldn't be getting discouraged, I think everyone means well.  If you have never invested before, there is a rule that says you should never use money you cannot afford to lose.  There are many scenarios that make investing/trading in Bitcoin still very risky.  If you do lose, you need to be in a position where you can fight again.  Out on the street is not a position to be.

But before telling people to be professional, please ensure you live up to it as well if you want credibility.  Don't swear or bait and don't milk this by spamming every thread.  People are now aware of this issue (even non-users like me ;) and it's up to Coinomi to deal with it in the context of their business.  If it's a non-issue for them, then their user-base will decide whether it is or not by uninstalling.

Wasn't the case for BCH but I understand what you mean.  I figure that the only people holding up the price of the coins are the initial "investors" who haven't anything to lose.  After that, speculators are looking to capitalize on short term movements... So basically just like every other coin out there.
People will ultimately follow the vision, not the coin.

Looking at a majority of the feedback, it is unfortunate that many don't address my original question but instead staunchly defend the status quo. Yet if you look at all the top posts in r/Bitcoin, they all suggest banks lack innovation, have high fees and have been stifling competition.  No one seems to see the irony in how they are responding to my question. 
Even if we say we are beyond innovation in the Bitcoin space (which doesn't seem the case since  around 2 users talked about future work), we still to consider reducing fees.  Technically speaking, I think it would be a big change to introduce % fees, so instead we need to make the fees low enough so people and business can transact with the knowledge that it's competitive compared to the alternatives. 
Relevancy is surely a key concern in any great technology and the market is fickle.  All you need is a solution that ups the ante on how businesses can transact cheaply, a few positive media reports, some good profits being made.. This could result in a market shift in a relatively short period of time. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:35:02
Then why should you expect anyone to use it?  Banks charge fees but they also provide a service and assurance for your money should you be a victim of fraud.  Bitcoin needs to compensate in some way for its fees.  Frictionless transactions is a feature of Bitcoin that was supposed to break the bank's stronghold on money. .

I believe you can set up your own Linux VM on a USB stick.  I personally think this is hard-core unless you're talking about huge amounts.

How does that then compete with upcoming crypto-currencies? I tried out another crypto the other day and I was amazed at the speed. I understand that if that crypto got more heavily utilized then things could slow down.  As per my original question, what is the plan to speed things up again and compete with the others?  From what you're saying there is no development roadmap and that I should just be content? I cant believe that there isn't an active effort to make things better - especially with all the great work that is now going on in the crypto-currency space. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:12:14

@_date: 2017-10-28 12:50:45
That's what made Bitcoin an amazing thing for me.  But I feel like it's losing its way with all this infighting.  As a result of the political challenges, people have had to close ranks and made it more centralized.  We now have developers, we have miners and we have commercial interests.  The framework was never built to contend with this. 
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:49:33
The reasons you state why Bitcoin is popular are not correct IMO.  Who runs a full node these days when you are competing with huge mining pools?  It is also arguable whether all the hash power is meaningful if it's centralized within a single country or select mining pools that could collude.
That said, Bitcoin has been the coin that has blazed a trail and withstood all the politics and technical attacks so far and I think that's what makes it special.  Will it remain that way?  Probably for the foreseeable future where crypto-currency really hasn't found its legs yet except as a store of value.  Once people do start using it for transactions, they will expect it to be fluid, cheap and simple to use.  I don't think many solutions out there, including Bitcoin, have all three things worked out yet.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:49:13
You'd be getting 2 for 1 coins but not double the fiat value.  One of the coins is likely to be quickly sold causing a drop in price. My guess is B2X is the one going to be sold off simply because the mainstream investors only know about BTC.

A legitimate application is telling you to upgrade and pointing you to a legitimate-looking project on a reputable (non-spoofed) Github link.  The project has been entirely cloned and looks legit.

My theory is that Bitcoin still doesn't have the full confidence of the market yet and is viewed more as a discretionary investment rather than a gold substitute.  As such, if there were another financial crisis, Bitcoin would see its price hit.  It's probably going to take this type of event for people to gauge exactly what is Bitcoin's place in the larger financial scheme.

Again, you fail to account for monetary policy and inflation of supply.  If that money goes, the price of BTC goes with it.  You also make comparisons in regards to other useless speculation vehicles such as ETH which are a dime a dozen.
Not to say that these tokens might not one day be useful but in an economy where people seek a safe haven, crypto has proven itself the most volatile of the lot.  The only reason why anyone would be putting cash into crypto at a time of bust is the possibility of their government seizing or losing their assets.  In such a case, a dollar peg is going to be your best bet.

Thanks for your well-crafted response.  I personally think that due to all these dramas, Bitcoin has been seriously tarnished as a potential medium of exchange, regardless of the variant.  It's not possible to keep forking the code and then playing a game of brinksmanship and division to see who wins.  Strength in the core coin is paramount since monetary systems are significantly reliant on faith that it works and that it doesn't succumb to political, technical or other adversarial "attacks". It has taken 10 years for Bitcoin to appear legitimate in the financial world.  The games being played to try starve or undermine the other chains will have a dragnet effect of bringing all other variants to the ground.  My belief is that another, better designed crypto which can distance itself from this drama and protect itself against endless forks will be the long term winner.  I believe Bitcoin will solidify itself as a store of value while Bitcoin Cash and SV will be payment methods for the faithful (not for the mainstream).  Whether CW is Satoshi or not, he cannot stop or influence  progress that's occurring right now that work to solve all these political dramas.  The new crypto-currency of the people - whichever that is - isn't going to be a grass-roots movement or lead by one person but one that has alliances with big business.

I'm afraid you are not dealing with reality and envisioning something that may or may not happen in the future.  Right now, if you want to make any transaction outside of a t-shirt or incidental purchase, you will need to use cold-hard fiat currency.  To boot, anyone who accepted and held BTC in the last few months is likely to have made a heavy loss on their sales.  That isn't good business.  Lots of things to work out before there's crypto-utopia.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:18:15
You conveniently leave out the fact that most mainstream investors have been told that Bitcoin is nothing but a speculative bubble - not unlike property prices you mention.  At least with property it has some intrinsic value and use.  In a tightening of money supply, I'd say that there's much more room for BTC to go down given the gains it has had during the boom.

I don't disagree with your synopsis, but that's different to saying that people are going to flee to crypto-currency for safe-haven.  It's more likely going to be something proven like physical gold.  In the case of economic collapse, you're better off investing in common household items as many people who have been in that situation will attest to.

The problem is that many people share lots of personal information online which allows the hacker to answer any challenge questions such as full name and birth dates.   Implementation of a procedure where you need to present yourself physically to a company branch if yoi don't know your PIN/password should be implemented.  They should also notify you of any suspicious activity relating to your account and lock it for 48 hours.   Inconvenient perhaps but would hopefully mitigate this problem.

I think you'll need to look at the firmware changelog and see what updates have been made.  Generally speaking, you'd want to keep the firmware as current as possible otherwise there is potential that the next time you use it wont work unless you update it.

I've always wondered whether this means more risk because it means more unethical hackers will be looking at the code to exploit it.  They of course aren't going to be telling you what bugs they've found..
The other problem is that it opens up attack vectors such as being able to compile new versions of the firmware and resell counterfeit copies.  I know this particular vector is covered by Trezor but it scares me how resourceful people are when it comes to stealing crypto.
