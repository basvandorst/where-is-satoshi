I'm sitting on bitaddress.org manically creating addresses over and over again.

That's exactly what I'm talking about. So I should be creating new addresses within my PC wallet program each time I take another transaction of BTC to my PC wallet?
Likewise, on my phone - which in theory, would get used even more frequently in terms of transactions - it's best practice to be using multiple addresses there too?
So each time I withdraw BTC from Coinbase to my PC I should use a new address and each time I "charge" my phone with BTC I should be sending it to a new address on the phone?
Hmmm... somehow I feel like that's going to be a bit of a barrier to entry for mainstream adoption. Most people are just going to want one address all the time I bet.

Argentina and countries like it are where the Bitcoin economy is really going to take off. An inflation-prone country-backed currency, a heavy mobile phone usage rate, merchants accepting BTC, and a huge potential for workers to be paid in BTC.

Of course, the BitBank would need enough BTC to make sure they can make loans and still give money back to depositors.  That's what a run on a bank really is and why there's FDIC in the first place.
So yeah, the BitBank couldn't get nearly as leveraged as it is with other currency, but leverage (and loans) is what helps the economy move. It seems BTC really has a number of characteristics that keep leverage to a minimum.
I'm undecided as to whether an economy can really function efficiently without leverage as a tool.

When I run it I can only seem to access it from localhost. What am I missing to get access from somewhere other than directly on the machine? I'm not talking about a firewall issue, either - I can't seem to get to it from another machine on my LAN using its IP address.

Isn't that more an implementation thing when you say the "wallet will take care of it"? For instance, I'm running MultiBit on my PC and it's perfectly happy with me sending and receiving BTC from the same address all day long.
Come to think of it, the two Android phone apps I have don't care either. I created an address and could just keep sending or receiving from those addresses as much as I wanted.

Which brings up a completely different future BTC issue.
Getting around nation-level economic sanctions.
There's still a matter of getting physical goods into the country if no one is willing to carry them, but it's impossible for the flow of BTC to be stopped forcefully.

Is the pro-BTC community, in general, against the concept of loans? I agree, long term loans won't work in a deflationary system, but I very much think loans are a key way to keep an economy moving and growing.

I must be missing something - I can't see where I can use BTC to buy that book.

So flip the scenario for a minute because I'm curious.
If the feds really were the "good guys" and were trying to crack down on a new way for criminals to launder their illegally earned cash (which was using localbitcoin.com to turn it into bitcoins) - how should they go about doing it?
