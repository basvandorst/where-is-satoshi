Love this. It's exactly the kickback you get. Always the line about it getting shut down.

In that case you're not actually getting the money that was sent, but money WU is releasing to the pickup person from their local office. The actual transfer of cash happens the next day or days later when that local pickup branch gets 'made whole again' for putting that cash out in the first place. 
It's fast because they are inside their own network, relying on the fact that their initial agent has successfully collected the funds, and their own parent company will create the trust for the transaction to happen now.
If you charge back your WU purchase a month later, the money doesn't suddenly disappear from the receivers hands after they've picked it up, but now WU is in a fight with the sender to collect money they already sent. 
Comparing speed of WU to speed of crypto is apples and oranges.

In your ATM example there is a middleman verifying the transaction. Just because it doesn't have 'confirmations' like crypto has doesn't mean it isn't validating that transaction against something. For that service, they take a hefty fee.

This is standard practice at Chase for years now. You can't deposit cash without ID, and that ID must be on the account your depositing to.
That $20 you wanted to give your niece? Sorry, you can't. Usually followed by something ridiculous like "but you could get a shared account with her if you'd like."

They could tell other exchanges they are tainted. Bitcoin isn't really fungible because of it too.

Venmo is a lot simpler for that, in my opinion. Also now a PayPal company.

In theory, the fraudulent activity of double spend never happens, so getting a refund is a non-issue.

Not everyone is making returns on it. Assuming your situation is the same as everyone else's won't benefit adoption one bit.

When fees are so high nobody uses them, it's just a crypto decoration.

Venequela and South Africa can't afford the Bitcoin fees.
