Send to an exchange, retrieve from said exchange.
But this is ridiculous anyway.

Most of these Islands are under the jurisdiction of countries though.
Is there even any piece of land left in the world?

Let's do this!

Oi, why was everything removed?

How about we make it a huge pizza party in the whole world for homeless people?  Bitcoin is decentralized, a universal currency and allows anyone to send any amount to anywhere in the world.
Let's use it for what it was made to do!

Great text, I'm all in!  I'll donate as much as I can.
I'm young and inexperienced, but I would gladly help if you need anything.
I mentionned doing it world wide.  If needed, I'm ready to set it up here in Quebec, Canada.
Great idea my dude!

I know right?  $15 to move my bitcoins to my own wallet?  Fuck off.

But transfering from coinbase to quadrigacx still has fees...
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:35:47
Canadians can't use GDAX sadly
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:19:13
I meant they select a high fee for a quick transaction.  I should've been clearer, my bad.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:33:54
Of course.  But Quadrigacx doesn't take credit cards, which are instant and easy.  That's why i use Coinbase to buy and Quadrigacx to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:44:25
Depends, but if you check other cryptos, it's about $1
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:45:07
And thet take the highest fee possible

And a bitcoin is the biggest unit of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:25:00
Where in Quebec?  I live there and seriously, I feel like I'm the only guy who knows about the existence of bitcoin...
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:12:30
Hmmm, I might try that...
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:04:52
How does this work?  I doubt that my work would accept to pay me in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:39:33
Did it?  I saw it reaching 1000 just when I posted it.  Sorry then.
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:07:45
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:37:57
But you know, I think it's cool.  They show a minimum of interest.  That's how these things take off right?

I'm having a good experience with Poloniex so far.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:44:41
wasso wasso wasso wasso
@_date: 2016-10-02 06:00:23
Poloniex has a trading plateforme.
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:51:22
Funny enough, I left coinbase yesterday and tried to join Circle, but nothing works for canadians.  Well, for me at least.
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:31:43
Right when price fluctuations could lead one to buy or sell more then usual...  That sucks.
