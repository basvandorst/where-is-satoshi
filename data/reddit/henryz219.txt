False. They did not "sponsor an ad," they listed hashprime as a "PARTNER." Big difference..in this case, a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Yeah, that's what I thought...

Cool. Thanks for the info...you really think hashprime is a ponzi scheme? I mean, you're probably right, but they just launched operations on 22-Sep. If they have servers that mine BTC, then why do they need additional BTC deposits from other people if they can just earn from their mining alone?

This wasn't just an ad, though...when nearly every other site label advertisements accordingly, and even major news sites separate ad links with terms such as "from around the web," that's one thing.
But when Blockchain lists a scam site under the heading, "OUR PARTNERS," it's different. As hashprime's "partner," Blockchain is an accomplice and should be held responsible for returning stolen funds back to it's victims.

Holding...In my personal opinion, I am guessing that the current downward trend is a result of manipulation...a few weeks ago, I read articles about big VC firms investing huge sums in BTC. Seeing as they're about to buy huge quantities of the digital currency, it makes sense that they would somehow manipulate the market to buy bitcoin for the lowest amount possible.
