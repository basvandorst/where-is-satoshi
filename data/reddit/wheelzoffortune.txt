Gone for good
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:10:30
That's awesome! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:53:01
Yes, the correction was greatly needed.  Couldn't have come at a worse time, though, with so many normies finally getting on board. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:46:50
It isn't about the present.  It is about future potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:40:55
Pretty much
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:58:32
Hadn't thought of that.  Thanks for the heads up. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:33:47
Blatant lies, misinformation, and general FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:13:43
The last time I bought (during the big dip) I got my coins in less than a few minutes.
To be fair, though, every other time it took at least a week.  Not sure why this time was different. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:29:06
50 Euros? That doesn't seem like much considering your salary. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:37:38
Well I think they have our best interests at heart. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:51:51
This is really awesome and makes me happy. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:25:42
Can confirm. I've gotten bitcoin with my CoinBase email. Pretty awesome. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:28:28
Nonsense. I sent .05 BTC twice earlier today and it cost me about $11 each time.
Stop FUDding. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:07:12
Even at the height of the network congestion, the most I waited was a few hours and that was with a super low fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:39:02
More like supply and demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:44:07
Was just about to say that.
It's my new favorite phrase ever.

As I understand it, the Nano S wouldn't be compromised because it is never actually online. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:36:47
Sounds interesting. Haven't seen it, though. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:32:07
Interested in this, too
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:24:56
Nano S 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:16:27
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:52:53
In the entire time bitcoin has been around, no one has ever thought of this argument. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:30:39
Yup. I agree.
If the transaction never confirms, the funds go back to the wallet, yes? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:40
Saw this earlier.  Hilarious
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:25:36

I love old articles like this, too.  Shows how far we've come. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:47:39
I just had this happen when my Nano S.  Never asked me before, but today it did.  No idea what to do and I don't want to mess things up. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:48:43
I can't really explain it properly and I was skeptical too, but then I got one and it was as if a light went off in my head.
I'll do the best that I can, though.
With a hardware wallet, the wallet itself is essentially the key.
Basically, with a usb stick, anyone can get your funds as long as they know your key/password, but with a hardware wallet, someone would need to have your exact wallet AND know your code, as well. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:32:24

IB "don't use Coinbase"
Why use a credit card anyway?  Bank account is faster/ easier. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:02:24
 Why
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:16:14
Wasn't that the mtgox failure? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:49:14
Yes, you should.  There will be guides when the time comes, probably. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:34:22
The author of that article is apparently not a native English speaker.  It looks like someone ran it through Google's translator.

@_date: 2017-11-28 02:02:44
I bought 3 a few days ago. One for each of my nephews and one for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:42:31
 That counts
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:08:05
For bitcoin?  Those days are gone. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:30:00
Yeah, I remember seeing that and thinking it was silly at the time.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:26:00
Que? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:05:19
It could reach $200,000, $500,000, or $1,000,000.
...COULD. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:33:09
Would be nice, but it is definitely not the case. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:02:25
Be thankful that you made money with your original holdings. If bitcoin goes to $1 mill, you'll still be fine with your new holdings. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:10:29
Not sure, but I decided to do 1/4 of the usual fee for a transaction a few days ago and it was confirmed quickly, oddly enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:46:00
By that logic I should have sold at $4k since I didn't buy until 2k.  Weird that I didn't, though. Instead I bought more.
If people want to post, let them post. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:14:37
This is a great post.  Lots of good information here.  Congrats to you!

@_date: 2017-11-22 05:04:59
Wow! That is pretty amazing. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:45:53
That's great that they helped. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:43:16
AFAIK, no one can mine "your" coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:14:07
Interesting.  He's saying that bitcoin isn't gaining value. The dollar is losing value in relationship to bitcoin, but not losing value in relationship to anything else.
Seems counterintuitive to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:19:58
Putting in more than you can afford to lose is stupid. In 15+ years of investing in stocks I have never done it and I'll never do it with crypto either. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:08:17
Real talk:  This is precisely why I believe that faucets are NOT a waste of time.  If you truly believe in this crypto stuff, then just clicking on some captchas a few times per day has the potential to be worth lots of money someday.
Faucets aren't about current value.  They're about expected future value.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:17:22
Agree. 
Cryptos are still far from being easily accessible for most people. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:57:17
That'd be unreal. Expectations would be shattered. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:22:33
If you believe in it long term, it shouldn't matter if you buy at $8k.

For me, mining isn't about the price of bitcoin now; it is about what I think btc will be worth in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:41:18
Why wouldn't you write down your backup phrase? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:32:19
Right.  It isn't always feasible, but when it is...  =)
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:55:08
I think it is a valid concern short term, but I don't think it is something that will affect bitcoin in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:08:33
Don't remember off hand, but whatever my wallet recommended.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:55:42
You can't mine bitcoin anymore unless you have tons of money to start out with
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:44:58
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:32:04
He's clearly afraid of bitcoin.
He says that it could destabilized the economy, but that is kind of the point. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:00:36
You get the coin at whatever price it is when you click to buy it.  Not the price 3-4 days later.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:43:50
Your coins are fine. It is just taking a bit longer to process right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:22:39
I'm waiting for Bitcoin Mithril tbh
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:54:43
You need special equipment to mine it.

@_date: 2017-11-26 01:16:07
So many people I've talked with about bitcoin think you have to buy an entire coin. :/
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:32:34
Whoa.  That's unreal. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:14:40
Totally thought this was about March 11th
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:05:32
 You can use it for some right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:57:42
Of course it could happen.  I don't think it is likely, though. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:31:58
Do you mean that they stole them?  I don't think you understand what mining is.
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:08:30
Good Lord.  That was ridiculously specific.
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:59:56
Technically you don't own the coins while they are stored on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:58:51
What did the WSJ say? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:14:34
Maybe short term.  Long term I don't think it'll make a difference.

I'm not really sure why a crack down on ICOs would cause a pop/failure of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:40:29
Does the same hold true for GDAX?  They're the same company, right?
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:49:39
Admits he was wrong, but sticks by his original claim of it being a bubble?

When the market dictates that it is. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:58:53
Congrats.  Definitely get yourself a hardware wallet sooner rather than later. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:23:02
There is plenty of info on the net.  I don't believe you need books for this.  It is so fast paced, any books would be outdated in no time.
I do believe reading is key, though.  Read news articles every day.  Read white papers.  Listen you YouTube personalities.  Read tweets even.
Take in everything.  Filter out the bad. Keep the good. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:19:49
Does that mean buying BTC on CoinBase will always give you segwit2x coins from now on? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:23:31
If you have the private keys, you should still be able to get them. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:02:02
That depends on how long you plan on holding. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:36:19
Inflation much? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:27:01
I don't think we are anywhere near being mainstream yet.
Why do you believe we are? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:29:38
I feel like this has been posted millions of times before.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:57:38
No.  Not even if all declare it illegal. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:05:40
Well, I have all of my Bitcoin holdings on my Nano S.  I never leave anything on exchanges.  I'm mainly concerned about buying more BTC after this "upgrade" happens.
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:36:27
Why bs?  I own at least 10 pair.  Then again, I often think to myself that I have to many socks. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:16:26
That's pretty kick ass. Congrats!
My first time was on a forum in 2012 or so.  I didn't buy any. 
Didn't buy until earlier this year actually. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:36:22
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:46:32
To be fair, they could still call it a scam at $100k, $500k, or even $1 million.  People who do not like it will keep saying bad things no matter what the price is. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:48:46
I'm not sure what him being disabled has to do with anything. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:15:13
So get a hardware wallet.  Keeping anything on any exchange is dangerous.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:03:50
I agree on the China part.  The ban is silly and stupid and will never work anyway. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:23:18
That is the dumbest PIN ever.  I can't believe I read the entire fucking article and I'm pissed he got his coins back. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:42:13
A correction may have happened anyway.  I think most of us figured the China thing was just a bump in the road. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:24:19
Tag because I'd like to know, too
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:37:21
Definitely not too late.  Buy however much you feel like.  You can always buy more another time if you feel you don't have enough
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:24:26
Sure we could, but I have (and everyone else SHOULD have) a 10+ year view for my crypto portfolio, so a sub 3k price is meaningless for me except that I'll buy more. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:08:18
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:08:40
Not that I disagree, but it isn't even above 4k right now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:43:25
I wonder what this graph will look like 10 years from now. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:24:35
 I'm not sure this is a secret to anyone. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:35:01
A hardware wallet is absolutely worth it.  Until you can get one, put your holdings in a software wallet like Exodus or something similar. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:37:26
Keep both, just as I did with BCH.  If one fails, then at least I still have the other.  Probably not the popular  opinion, but that is what I will l do.

I'm probably dumb, but wouldn't a proxy or something similar work?

That isn't that much money.  If you don't absolutely need it now just hold it. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:57:55
I feel like this can have good and bad implications.

@_date: 2017-10-21 03:40:41
How can it dip to $9k if it is at $6k now? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:26:27
Yes, that's correct.  You get it at the price it was when you clicked buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:52:01
It is foolish to think "I can afford one litecoin, but I can't afford one bitcoin."
You don't have to buy an entire bitcoin.  When I first started with crypto, I only bought .15 bitcoin.  I kept adding to it whenever I could, though.
(I'm not saying don't buy litecoin, I'm just explaining that you shouldn't be thinking in terms of 1 btc or 1 eth.  You can buy fractions.  That is part of the beauty of cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:06:14
Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:28:13
I'm holding for several years, at least, but it depends on your financial situation really.  If you can afford it, hold as long as you can imo.
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:57:24
I'm long on bitcoin, but that article doesn't really say anything we don't already know.  I guess it is good for newbies, though. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:49:23
That sucks, but I don't think it's too late to get in again. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:38:53
Don't you mean not impossible, but unlikely rather than the other way around? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:56:45
Pretty much this
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:06:21
?  Aren't crypto exchanges banned there currently? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:45:25
People are always so eager to invest AFTER the price goes way up.  The time you should have gotten in was during the dip.
I guess it won't really matter in a few years, though.
Only buy what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:48:50
Never thought of that.  Sounds like a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:23:52
Mining on your own has been impossible for quite some time.
