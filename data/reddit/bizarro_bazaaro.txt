there's less than 30 million wallets, many are lost wallets, many people own several, but then many just hold on an exchange. Lets say 40 million or less people own BTC. That's 0.5%
Total supply is 21 million, an estimated 3-4 million at least are lost already. If you manage to have at least one btc, the maximum number of other individuals with one BTC will be 17 million. 
That means you'd be in the top 0.2% of the world's holders of bitcoin wealth. That's INSANE. We are still very early.

by the time BTC is approaching '1 million USD' it will be it's own unit of currency and method of exchange. It'll be a near stable coin and won't be measured against fiat. It'll be measured against what it can purchase 'a basket of goods'.

The term 'hodl' is cringeworthy. Grow up.

You’re not quite understanding what I’m saying. The issue will be the difference in the terminology used, difference in price format, within a small area. Your point about scanning codes etc would needed implicit trust in the vendor, which is not always the case. 
Secondly, the fiat currency value would be irrelevant, bitcoin at this point would be its own unit of currency as it would have reached a relatively stable value. As long as it’s being converted from BTC to fiat, adoption will be minimal.

I’m more so referring to within a country. One shop prices milk at 952 sats, another prices it at 9.52 ubits or whatever. The average joe may get confused and end up fleeced by a factor of 10. But yeah, eventually everyone would adopt the same format within a country or economic area, early days would be more open to abuse.

There will eventually need some sort of consensus though so consumers can quickly and easily compare prices across different vendors and within their own heads against what would be a fair price.
