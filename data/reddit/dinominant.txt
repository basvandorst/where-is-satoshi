You joke, but in some strange sequence of events the community and mines could agree to rewind the block chain for some reason...

I've started keeping a detailed log of all data I enter into online accounts (bitcoin related or otherwise). I find it helps when I have overwhelming evidence of ownership when I can provide all private details of everything about my accounts.
Details such as:
* the exact strings entered as my name, address, etc.
* when my account was opened or updated (down to the minute)
* amounts transferred in/out and traded, and when
I also keep a backup of my google authenticator tokens in my [Keepass]( safe and have multiple backups of that file which I update from time to time.
I realize it might be too late to do all that with your locked account, but it's never too late to start.

From the perspective of the winner, what is more likely? A once-in-a-lifetime winning event, or a bug in satoshidice that pays out lots of bitcoins.
I would also bet again, but I would also cash out most of those bitcoins and pay my mortgage.

When I attempt to lookup the transaction you posted I can see all kinds of details, but my transaction causes an error:
ERROR: unknown (Most likely my bitcoind stopped working or this page is too large/complex.)

Given the type of work that people at the NSA do, I think they have incentives in place to prevent just that. Between the security clearance, access to classified secrets and technology, I'm sure their pay/pension is appropriate.
Not to mention what would happen should you attempt it and get caught. You would probably disappear and those coins would be lost in the blockchain.
