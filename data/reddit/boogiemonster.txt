A few days ago I saw a commercial for overstock on TV. At the end of the commercial there was a small graphic that said we accept bitcoin. Its crazy to see how popular bitcoin has become since last year.

i just wanted to say that i just got my flavors in today, i got berry mint and Café Sumatra. i have to say berry mint is a good contender for my favorite flavors. i always order from ivape, who is another vendor that is active on reddit. they have awesome juices and a huge selection but i might have to switch it up every once in awhile with vapor station. i hope to see more flavor selections from your guys and ill definitely be a future customer once my juice runs out. thanks for the free samples!

I'd love to see what your opinion is

Your close,the computer needs to stay off the internet as soon as you shut it off to boot Ubuntu/Linux. An internet connection is not needed to create a paper wallet. I used bitadress.org to create mine and my coins have been safe since march.

I probably should be more concerened then i am, if a hacker gets into dwolla then they have a lot of my information. Still if you want to use dwolla they are cheap and have awesome customer support.

Do you have money laying in an exchange just for that reason. I would have bought more last night if it didn't take a week to get my money into btc

from my understanding it does not ruin the point of a paper wallet. what i did was deposit my funds into my paper wallets public address and watch it on blockchain. once i want to spend it i will type in the private key to use those funds. however as soon as i type my private key into block chain i will never use the public address linked to that private key as a safe wallet ever again.

I just used camp bx yesterday to buy my first bitcoins ever, it was nice because i didn't have to wait for my account to be verified. All i did was send money from dwolla and about 2 hours later the money was in camp bx. From there it was simple enough to buy and move to my wallet. Would reccomend
