I mean that was interesting but what the fuck is the point of this bot.

Huh? You totally can. But Bitcoin is the most popular crypto, both in the community and in the media, which attracts the most investors and therefore is the 'defacto' crypto for storing money. Like, you could store large amounts of money in something like Iron, but most people stick to Gold. I get that you can't directly compare value of metals to cryptos, but I hope you kind of get my point. Bitcoin is the standard because Bitcoin is the standard.

I mean normally I'm against the use of /s on reddit, but in the end you have to admit it's the internet and the main way of detecting sarcasm is lost on the internet, so it's not always going to be detected.

Like less than 1% of the world uses crypto.  It may be in the news, but bitcoin and altcoins are nowhere near "normie" status.

It is possible to hold more than one coin, even if they are competing. Do you think investors only invest in one phone company, one watch company etc?
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:26:24
There will be in  a few years ;)

Learn to handle opposing views, man. They said nothing to support bch  and nothing to attack bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:59:46
IMO altcoins have different use cases, very few are actually shitcoins. Bitcoin isn't so much used for transactions of small amounts anymore, but to store high quantities of money. Bch is one solution for low-cost transactions, there are others also that are arguably better.

Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and least likely to suddenly drop to like $1, hence making the most sense as a store of value. Right now isn't a super example as all coins are down like 10-20%, but typically Bitcoin's value hasn't fluctuate much recently.
Also, as you can tell by all the HODL memes, many people here are using Bitcoin to store value - not withdraw or spend it. So the speed at which they would be able to do so does not bother them much if at all.

Same thing can be said for gold really. Like who the fuck trades gold for goat cheese or something, or even much more expensive items.

Being a rural-ish (not some remote village, but certainly not a big city) resident in the UK and under 18, options for buying Bitcoin or really any crypto are limited for me. Annoyingly I'm going to have to wait for a few years until I can properly buy any, by which time I suspect cryptocurrency usage will have shot up, along with prices.
But for anyone of legal age / ability to buy, then yes this is an ideal time to buy buy buy.

Just like there is more than one successful physical currency (USD, GBP, EUR) there can and are more than one successful cryptocurrency. And calling others a noob when your account is 92 days old is a little hypocritical...

Do you still need to do loads of verification to buy btc? I remember that turned me off it before, I believe it was from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:12:50
S..stop using Bitcoin as a currency? Nice.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:45:17


Like 90%+ of this subreddit. Who is actually still using bitcoin as a currency like intended instead of "hodl"ing this " store of value".
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:51:06
Yeah but I'm under 18 and have no idea what half of the needed verification is.

Whether or not its justified is not relevant to whether it is still censorship, and anyone can censor something, and you are right that private spaces have a *right* to censor. I'm just saying even though they can, that doesn't mean they should. I've seen a lot of screenshots of people being banned for promoting bitcoin cash in a bitcoin subreddit, or for expressing ideas that the mods personally disagree with - again, they *can* censor these posts and ban those users, but I still disagree with that, and think that others shouldn't support their decisions.
I'm a very anti-censorship person, though. If it were up to me, I would allow anything short of breaking the law on reddit, regardless of if I personally agreed with the message. Moderation to me is just another way of saying suppression, that somehow one small group of people has more worth than the average joe, that their opinions matter more than the collective majority.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:36:38
The concern here isn't what you've responded to. The concern is that such as small group can just decide the future of bitcoin on a whim - people can fork, but just look at how well that went for bitcoin cash. Effectively, bitcoin is controlled by elites who can make whatever changes they want, as long as they can do it sneakily enough, because the majority will go along with it even if it doesn't benefit them, or forces inconveniences on them. The concern over moderation in r/bit coin is that a large number of opinions are being actively censored, to prevent legitimate debate and push the opinions of the moderators forcibly.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:39:39
Concerns over censorship and too much power in too few hands is stupid?
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:10:59
Probably because of the title....
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:58:52
Yeah, I was just providing a reason for why it was sitting at 0 with so few comments. Of course, it would probably be at 0 anyway with a different title, but maybe there would've been more comments.
