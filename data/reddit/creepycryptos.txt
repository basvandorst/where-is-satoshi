a lot of people have been saying this but I have only ever seen orders that big on Gdax (which i watch basically nonstop) unless it's in the middle of a big rally and it always sucks the life out of them. it'll now stuck at 5012 and other buyers will soon start undercutting each other to get sell orders in front of this one. Look around it. They're all for either under 1 to 3 max. this happened this morning when it was over £5k and it killed the charge dead. as soon as it was back down at 4980ish the order disappeared. I'm just trying to get my head around the motivation. I get that it's part of the game. I'm not complaining. Just wondering why. Never mind, that order is gone. haha.

Thanks, man. Really just curious as to why: what is to be gained by clogging up the works? Your answer makes sense. Thanks. Sorry reddit is only letting me get one reply in every 10 mins or so so I'll tack this in here too: that order is back at £5055.51. Could it also just be a dude with a nice chunk of coin that is letting the minnows nibble at it as he keeps moving it up with the market?

I only ask wise redditors like yourself questions so I can learn. Was curious as to the motivation behind an order 16x outside the ordinary. Maybe it's just the way that dude sells, all in every time, and move the price as required. Your comment, though not super helpful, is appreciated all the same.

Novice at bitcoin. Just trying to learn. This looks like an attempt at manipulation but I don't understand why. Is this a whale that has shorted the market? Trying to kill a rally by creating a bottle neck?

or when you're waiting for your Kraken deposit to clear but now it won't happen till monday (by which time it'll be oooooover) and you'll have to wait to catch the next dip next friday.

and another question: when the spread is low, below 5, isn't that the buyers telling us that they want to pay more? why aren't we letting them pay more? should we move our orders up at that point?

could it be a whale, spooked by the dip last week, waited for the price to improve sufficiently before dumping theirs?

but I've seen it on GDAX down to 0.01 this morning a couple times. Does it not help to move orders to clear the path for the green bar? Are the whales intentionally slowing the market with the big blocks I see in the data? Just curious really.
