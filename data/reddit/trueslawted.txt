I just wish it was easier to buy over here in the UK. Like just deposit £ into an exchange :(

I'm a student intern for the year, i'm being ballsy just by coming onto reddit hehe

I ended up using that exact same website, was bit dubious at first but the guy was top notch, had the coins in my wallet within 10 minutes!
I'm tempted to buy when i have the funds. I seen on reddit that it reached an all time high of $300 and i seen it today was at like $331 or something.
