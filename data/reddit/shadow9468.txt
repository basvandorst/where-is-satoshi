Im talking about forex platforms to be simple, most trusted and regulated platfroms started to add bitcoin as an asset to onvest in
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:34:16
The way the trsaction is smooth amd with less fees and delays really makes you wonder are you actuallt buying bitcoin ?

Aha but dont u think a 1k difference is kindda big ?

Sorry for being a noob, but then why everyone in this sub reddit is dealing with coindesk coinmama etc... and suffer delays and fees?
I mean in this sub this kind of investment is never mentioned

How will butcoin get adopted if a 10$ worth of transaction can have a fee of similar amount and high delays? 
Even if bitcoin is out of this world, if it does not appeal to the common how will it get ahead ?
At the moment it's something an investor dumps money into becausother investors are,, when will it transition to be appealing to all business and get adopted to be of real world value

But then it will go up :p hahahaha

Thank you sir
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:11:42
Exactly so why not to do so?
Lower fees, transaction delays are not of my business amd a very trusted and regulate platform so why not lend it money to buy bitcoina from me?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:16:13
I would rather back it with fiat to avoid the many flwas that bitcoin has right now
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:56:32
Why arent alot of orher people using this to invest? It avoids the high fees and delays specially that many of the cons can be easily delt with

So i have been looking to buy bitcoin, and decided to use cex.io since coindesk isnt supported in my country. However, i noticed tgat cex has the price of bitcoin all wrong!! It says 17140 atm, wtf is that price ??
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:10:15
But when you buy bitcoin from a forex platform, i highly doubt that they are buying actual bitcoins for you
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:21:52
Whats the difference of buying actual bitcoins from lets say coinmama and buying shares in bitcoin from etoro? 
Both are an actual representation of the real rime price with etoro having lower fees and transaction delays.
I understand that investing in a share wouldnt allow me to buy stuff with bitcoin but i am not going to anyway. So what are other disadvantages??
