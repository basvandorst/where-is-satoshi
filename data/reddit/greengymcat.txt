Can you point to a good tutorial for running a node on Pi?

He’s not wrong!
@_date: 2018-10-20 20:34:05
Yes, obviously!

Thanks so much for your answer. I have to spend a bit to of time processing it (no pun intended) but I think I get the idea. Thanks again, super helpful for me.

Good point. Thanks.

There is no security without a huge hashpower especially if the "proof" algorithm is close to one already used by bigger coins.  Hackers have been stealing money left and right!

I think I get the first part. Would that still be true if transactions referenced blockHash:index?

I see that now: the Txid allows transactions to be moved around easily. I will check the white paper again. Thanks so much for your explanations.

I think you are right on Bitcoin being an experiment, a perfectible concept. What I find interesting is how much bitcoin has already changed, and how much change it can still incorporate in the future. 
That being said, ignoring all altcoins is indeed foolish.

The ride is definitely taking you to the moon.

Any good ressources on Schnorr ? Something easy-ish to understand, please!

By doing that you are just multiplying the possibilities by a factor, say 400.
 (20x20 if sentences are 20 words long on average).
