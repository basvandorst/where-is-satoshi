Nothing you just mentioned has anything to do with Bitcoin itself. It has to do with people. There are scammers, manipulators, and cheaters in every currency in the world and ever currency there ever has been. It's a people problem, not a bitcoin problem, the Bitcoin protocol is working just fine, and there are plenty of great people and businesses in the Bitcoin space

Thanks for the info, could you provide the source? I know others have had trouble finding much about them aside from their promotional video.

I would use one of the most scrutinized events in the world as an example: The US Presidential Election. Explain how blockchain technology could be used for provably fair voting without human error which can also be verified by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Extrapolate on that to explain the corruption in voting among lesser developed nations and the impact it can have there.

If it were as simple as: "fiat goes down therefore spend it, btc goes up therefore don't spend it" then logically you would have already converted all your fiat into Bitcoin, and you would be spending Bitcoin out of necessity.

New york doesn't, Ben Lawsky is trying to force them to, which is a noble cause to fight against as this will be really annoying for anyone living in NY, particularly people looking to have startups.


I disagree, New York is the financial capital of the world (recently surpassing London), most, if not all, states in the US will at least be taking some pages from their book, if not just copy pasting it. Even if they don't, startups may have to ban people from NY: 


This is what OP is trying to get Ben to do, is it not?
I agree that even if this passes, bitcoin will continue to thrive and bitcoin related business will just be pushed outside of NY at NY's expense, and I'm sure Ben will look back at this as a huge mistake. However, we still have time to change these regulations from being a roadbump in bitcoin adoption into a new highway. While it would be nice to say "I told you so" to Ben down the line, I'd much rather take this opportunity to turn an annoyance into a betterment while we still have the chance.
Edit: I would also add that Ben has been active within the Bitcoin community, even going so far as to host an AMA. Some have speculated that it was all a 'trojan horse', but I'm not so sure. Taking the time to come here and do an AMA means he pays attention to us and so I think our efforts to change these regulations will not be in vain.

For those saying that US players still can't play, I think they may actually be able to. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) which made it effectively impossible for US players to play online poker, did so by disallowing banks to transfer funds to gambling sites. It never actually banned playing poker, it's just that no one could get funds onto the sites because of banks blocking the transfers, and so poker was effectively banned in the US.

They block them because of the rule with US banks. They don't want to have to deal with failed transfers from US people and the emails explaining why. With this new funding option, it would bypass those transfers and so I see no reason why they wouldn't allow US players.

See my post in here. I think it might allow US players to play
