I've mentioned it somewhere in this thread, but it seems the "we are concerned block" needs a bit better marketing.  I think the point above relates to that.  A few more blog posts or similar.  I was thinking of how we can take gmaxwell's reddit, bitcointalk etc. posts and put it as a series of blog posts.  Or something.   I think the concerns are so valid but it seems lost in a sea of FUD.

The more we centralise the more bitcoin becomes like Visa or a bank (or a government).  What is the point of that?  Bitcoin can't compete with that?  Bitcoin's key differentiating advantage is being trustless.  I don't have to trust anyone or any central authority.  We are losing our key differentiator by centralising. At worst bitcoin would become a poor 2nd rate credit card company.  As all transactions you'd have to wait 10 min.  So what have we achieved with that?
I think the "we are concerned camp" needs better marketing.

I guess it would work more like a dollar peg.  Many small countries peg their currencies to other larger countries.   Many chose the dollar, but there are others, e.g. Namibian dollar pegs 1:1 to the South African rand.  
I reckon it depends on the currency. If Nambia's (small country of 2m people) currency were pegged to bitcoin I'd imagine bitcoin would follow it's fate rather than vice versa.  Because Namibian trade figures are a couple of billion USD in and out.  That would surely swamp bitcoin trade and their efforts to peg bitcoin value to a certain exchange rate would be sure swamp the bitcoin markets.

I'm not forcing anyone.  But if there is only 2 full nodes why not just use your credit card.  The credit card will be easier, quicker, and accepted in more places.  What is the point of having bitcoin using such few nodes that we are almost back at trusting central authority. They can't fake your transactions but they can make them never confirm.  They could unconfirm payments you received.  Etc.  They will know the source of transactions.  Civil forfeiture problems?

I really can't see why people don't see the obvious:
Some may not be a ponzi but still not actually mining.  Given the prices and likely difficulty growth rates they are simply paying you back your own money using a difficulty formula but not actually mining.  The reason they do this is because so many people are willing to pay for cloudmining at crazy high prices.  You should be able to run such an operation reasonably well with limited risk.  One could take in someone's money, and keep it in reserve paying them back until the contract ends.  If you price conservatively you may not ever need money and you should have some money left over once the contract ends.
In essence it's a futures *contract* and basically a bet on future difficulty.  The big risks (to the operataror) is pricing accurately and dynamically and of course the risk that difficulty drops unexpectedly.  With an unexpected difficulty drop, you may have an issue as you will suddenly have to pay out more but will have no additional income.  Of course you can probably hedge your position slightly by buying some real mining capacity just in case.  The extent to which you hedge will determine potential downside (and upside of course).
The big risks to the investor is that the operator is not competetent enough to run it poperly as above, or is greedy and starts eating into reserves early (i.e. becomes a ponzi).  The biggest risk to the investor though is their own poorly conceived research in paying overpriced rates for mining.  
For cloudminers I would require either proof of mining, so I know they actual run the right amount of miners.  Alternatively I want assurance that they have enough money on hand to pay out all future contractual committments at a reasonable future difficutly growth assumption.
Of course one could easily be tempted to turn such an operation into a ponzi by paying out from incoming funds and taking the rest as profit, but these guys should already be making money so no need to be crazy.
It's so fricken obvious.  I mean if you read some of the sites they sell you a mining *contract*.  They don't actually say they will be mining.  They payout is not based on actual mining but a formula.  Another clear hint.  
In an overpriced mining market this may well be the only way to effectively sell mining short.  I would do this as well, but feel slightly guilty in doing this.  I can see that you can stay on a slightly grey line by selling contracts and not correcting people when they assume you are actually mining.  I think it's ok to do it, but I would not feel 100% comfortable doing this.  But really the investor is just buying something that's essentially over priced.  
You might think you are safe buying the actual hardware, but I believe the margins of the companies are just adjusted to just reflect the likely profitability, because let's face it, if a company is selling a miner that's going to be extremenly profitable at their marginal electricity cost they'd be sellling a gold, sorry I mean, bitcoin mine.

Miners mine a block with transactions in.  Once a block is found they need to exclude the transactions in the new block from the next block to be mined.  While waiting to figure this out, they may, as a short-cut they mine a empty (other than the coin reward tx) block until they've figured it out.  This is to stop the mining hardware from waiting for work.  
If they happen to find a block during this short period you see such blocks emerge.  This is often shortly after a previous block. Though there is nothing stopping a miner from always doing this.  The only way to encourage them to include more tx is the fees on those tx.

Your first hop the exchange can suspect that it's your address (it may not be 100% the case but usually is).  Nobody else will be able to link it to you.  So reduce that risk by not contributing any other funds from other exchanges to that address.  Also if you do multiple withdrawals from the same exchange use a different address each time.  
Don't think it will make a difference to split 1 withdrawal into many smaller ones (when doing it at the same time).   I think it might be worse as you would have many more addresses that the exchange knows about.  If that exchange balance all goes to the same address the first transaction that occurs moves that balance and loses the link.  They won't be sure if you still have the funds.  Whereas if you slowly spend from multiple addresses some addresses will remain some time with a balance and the exchange will know how quickly you are spending the withdrawal you made.

OK, but people generally forget there is priority of needs and there are much more important things than bitcoin for many Africans living in poverty.

Miners aren't storing it.   All nodes are. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:53:03
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:17:57
When a new node starts up for the first time it contacts one (?) of a collection of dns seeds that maintain a current list of nodes.  These are multiple seeds maintained by separate people/entitites.  The nodes obtains a list of nodes from the seed and starts connecting to them.  
Nodes also advertise nodes they know about to nodes connected to them. 
So once a new node has connected to some nodes it will only connect to nodes it has previously connected and to nodes being "advertised" from nodes it connects to.  
It keeps track of nodes in a file on the disk.  If the node is restarted it will read the nodes off the disk and connect to them.  Only if this fails will it try the dns seeds again.
That's the ELI5 version.  There may be some subtleties.  E.g. I think if the dns seeds fail there is a fallback to some hardcoded nodes as well.

Difficulty is where it should be to keep block times to 10mins  (give or take two weeks of lag). Not more not less.
I don't believe mining revenues are enough to manipulate the price in such a way.  You have volumes of 180k BTC to 1m BTC traded this week (depending on how much credibility you wish to give the CNY based trading).  And you have +/- 25k in bitcoin created this week. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 11:32:03
I think you are trying to maintain high level of anonymity. 
I'd send the money form each exchange to a new address.  The exchange will know that address belongs to you.  But once you start spending it will be difficult to follow.  Not sure how much you gain by splitting each exchange into different addresses.  
It also depends on your typical spending profile.  If you plan to spend lots of small amounts relative to the deposits you'd be ok.
If you plan to spend a single or relatively large amounts then all the outputs from the different exchanges could be linked together in one transaction.  Then those outputs (and corresponding addresses) will be identified as potentially linked.
In any case I'd be sure to always not to reuse addresses where possible. 
It also depends on each exchange practicing no address reuse and also where you are sending your money too.  If everyone is not reusing addresses the trail becomes more difficult to follow.

Doesn't seem to me to be a real use of blockchain tech.  To secure the data you do need to protect it with keys/passwords/encryption.  Why also publish it on a blockchain?  What am I missing?

Not sure what's new: If you have electricity, a smartphone and the data connection you can run SPV clients that are already available.
Problem is the electricity, smartphone, data in poorer/rural parts of many countries in Africa.  Even in poor urban areas the data is quite expensive compared to what people are earning.  Second hand/ hand me down smartphones are less of a problem in urban areas.  Most phones out there are still not smartphones though, so you need to address that also.
Solar panel is a big problem! It's expensive.  Also if you have "surplus electricity" (from solar or otherwise) you just run an extension cord to your neighbour who pays you in local cash.  Much easier/efficient than mining on your phone?  Surplus electricity is often availabe in townships when people tap into the power grid illegally or bypassing meters.  It carries some risks (electrocution).

@_date: 2015-05-18 10:39:39
You may be confusing two things:
* For property/car/shares transfers you'd probably need a separate blockchain to control the property in question.  It may be a sidechain.  I.e. the same way the current blockchain controls ownership of bitcoin another blockchain may control ownership of a share or property etc.
* The other side is that you can store the hash of some document/image/data in the blockchain as is.  This allows you to prove that data/info existed, because faking the hash is practically impossible.  This is possible as is.  See for example:

The hash power will go where the value is and that will be in core.  Early trading indications are that a BU currency will trade at a significant discount.  
Also you cannot follow mining signatures as apparently miners may be signalling support for BU just to avoid being attacked by BU.

This is the right answer sort of ,but the 50% is wrong.  
The average time is 10min but the distribution is not symmetrical so the probability of 1 block in next 10 minutes is higher than 50%.  The chances of the next block being within 10 minutes is 63.2%.  This is higher than 50% because most blocks are found within 10 minutes.  But some blocks take a long time to be found which brings the average up to 10 minutes (but still means most get found in less than 10 minutes).
This assumes that the current hashrate and difficulty is in sync and stable.

The miner is probably more concerned over the full lifetime of his gear (rather than just 100 blocks of delay).  This could be 1 to 2 years I believe though I'm not up to date with mining tech.
Their uncertainties mainly relate to:
* Price of bitcoin
* Future difficulty increases
* Cost of electricity in the future (but probably more stable)
This allows them to remove some of the price uncertainty.  Not sure how far ahead the futures will be offered.

To me the understanding about why bitcoin is different is not clear enough to people.  People are getting on the band wagon without realising the key differentiation that Bitcoin offer.

People need to borrow money, that is fundamental.
As soon as you lend me BTC100 you're running a "fractional reserve" or put differently you have an assets on your balance sheet that is not really there.  That asset (debtor) of BTC100 that I owe you is in your accounts.  But you don't *have* that unless I pay you back.  
That is fundamental to lending.
Everybody needs to borrow money and then everybody who lends have these debtors which are not liquid.  This is fundamental.
Banks are pooled lending vehicles where lenders (depositors) pool money to be lended to invidiuals (borrowers).  Fractional reserving requirement is actually a safety net which means banks can borrow out less than their deposits as a safety margin.  
In my example if I lent your the BTC100 you gave me fully to someone else then I run a risk.  You might want your BTC100 back but I may not be able to get it back.  If I were a bank I would only be able to lend out say BTC80 of the BTC100. 20 being the fractional reserve.  
What crypto/bitcoin tech may allow in future is for banks to prove (like exchanges do currently) exactly their assets and liabilities.
But people thinking fractional reserving in bitcoin is not going to happen are not facing the fundamentals of how credit in an economy operates.  And if it does not happen economies can't really be based on bitcoin.

My thoughts are that bitcoin will be fractionally reserved by banks at some point.  You can't run an economy without credit and you can't do credit without fractional reserves.

I understand you can't see from the blocks whether this has been employed.  


It's a bad thing if I pay the electricity and buy the harware and they collect the extra performance from the electricity / hardware I paid for.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:37:21


Well in a way this is a fraud proof.  These miners are committing fraud by selling equipment that is under performing.
I have not looked at mining hosting providers so I don't know this is true.  It would however be a great leap of imaginiation that if  you buy access to the hash rate online they keep that 30% extra performance to themselves?  So essentially their users by hosted miners are funding their 30% as well?

There would have been only dns lookups outbound at this stage. The traffic would not have flowed yet as the central server is not active (at the moment). 
This probably makes it slightly more difficult to spot. But as soon as someone creates an A record for that host they'd be able to switch off quite a lot of miners.

To mine the correct block you need to know of any other blocks as quickly as possible after they are found.  The time it takes you to find out about new blocks is wasted as any mining during that time you will probably create orphan blocks and waste some of your hash rate. So the more unreliable your connection the higher orphan rate you'd see.
@_date: 2017-04-30 22:34:11
Anybody know who this was? coin-br?
@_date: 2019-01-07 13:16:36
Everybody is solving a different block. At least the Coinbase should be different for example. So the nonce space is unique for each miner or group of miners at least.  Hence nobody else can search these gaps than the miners in question. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:57:14
Cool, someone told me that they accept bitcoin and I forgot.  They are more like a bar also though. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 13:14:47
You say that you expect it's a bug.  It's only a bug if the they stop hashing.  If they continue hashing on a different header or exta nonce then they should be fine as any nonce is equally likely to provide the answer as far as is known.
It might be something to optimise if time is wasted changing the exta nonce or header. Bitmain may have optimised it already?
So bug is perhaps the wrong word. Signature or feature due to methodology or something like that may be a better description of this feature.

The fact is any new chain has higher risk so it should be reflected in price. The contract is fair and balanced as it is symmetrical. The price reflects the higher risk of S2x. The time limit is practical though. If you feel there is chance to have fork layer you need to reduce what you are willing to pay S2x.

There is a central discovery server to help your devices find each other, but you can run it on your own server if you even want to avoid that last bit of centralisation.  Plus you don't need it if you are only syncing on your lan.

Centralised mining where we have warehouses full of miners owned by corporate entities or individuals is the problem.  Imagine if one of those get a large share of hashing power?  We'll have to trust them to stay honest or trust that their government doesn't want interfere in bitcoin.  
The whole point of bitcoin is to trust only yourself.  Centralisation is a problem.

I was also thinking this might be a possibility.  Need to figure out how fees are estimated for various wallets?  And to what extent they may be sensitive to this.
If I were simply taking the minimum fee included in the last block as an estimate then surely I'd be wrong.  If I average this over the last n blocks I'd be less wrong but still be pushed up.
Core keeps track of tx in the mempool and check how long tx of various fee levels take to confirm (or that is my broad understanding).  Again a form of averaging but still susceptible to some manipulation?
@_date: 2017-05-03 11:43:36
What you've done is also assumed that current difficulty is set to match the current global hash rates.  The current global hash rate is usually not though.  You can ignore the global hash rate and just look at currently difficulty vs. your hash rate.  
Look [at this for an explanation](
The global hash rate is growing (generally but not always) which means difficulty is always lagging the growing hash rate.  So your calc will underestimate earning.
Also 20 should be 10 in your formula. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:27:59
Address reuse is also a problem here.  If you keep using the same address to receive payments then it's more likely that things can be traced.  So new address for every bitcoin you receive is the best.

I think I'm saying they need education, healthcare, income first, basic cheap working financial systems second, then savings vehicles and only then sovereignty.  It would of course be nice if they could get all that in one go, but you know.




Most only have a phone.  Feature or smart phone.  So I recon SPV is the way to go. Even in South Africa which, compared to Mozambique is well developed, most browsing online is on phone but no or limited internet at home etc.


Power users there would have OK internet and a reasonable PC.  Internet might not be great, but would probably be running on the mobile network anyway (mobile powered hotspot type devices) and should be decent in the cities.   Edit: BW cost might be a problem though.  
The other point I wonder about is how do we convince these people who often would not have had much education that these kind of systems is better than the bank with the busted ATM and paper work.  Especially convincing them about the trustless and decentralised nature of the system (your sovereignty).  It takes a lot to understand that USP bitcoin has.  Even for well educated people.

I'm pointing out the obvious here but:
* VNC security can be weak and shouldn't be exposed ourside your LAN without knowing what you are doing.
* blockchain.info wallet is probably not the most secure (has [had security issues]( in the past)
* Using an online wallet such as blockchain.info  anyway is less secure given that amount of money.  You could be running your own node and wallet.
* Using any online bitcoin service without 2FA is suicidal.

If it does fail because of SegWit we should not role out SegWit.  If it fails because the person who put up the bounty gets hacked or something then that's a different story.

[Correction on that](
@_date: 2017-05-08 08:57:37
There is a hierarchy of needs and financial sovereignty is not as high as other needs.  I think savings is important but not sure how.  The Mozambican might feel he has sovereignty when he has his fishing dhow. Or his coconut grove.   So the savings need doesn't arise that often.  It could be solved by simple efficient centralised alternatives also.
The problem is his alternatives are so poor. With limited access to alternatives what can he do when he does want to save?  So you want to cater for him.  The Swiss and the German have access to so many alternatives that work efficiently. 
I am taking Mozambique a little too literally but I remember being on an island off the coast of Mozambique with the only ATM on the island being busted.  And no credit cards accepted.  Had to use paypal to pay for my accommodation.  Not sure what the locals did (if they even had bank accounts).

I have to say your poll questions can do somewhat with better wording.

I tend to agree with you. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:13:56
Using a new address for each transaction makes sense from a privacy perspective (a little security wise also).
Couple of things you could do:
* Go to the exchange.  Check that they sent it.  Find the transaction hash (id). Must be in transaction history or similar.
* Look at it on a blockchain.info or similar.  See where it was sent to.  Check that your address is in the list of where it was sent to.  Confirm that it's the right address. I.e. from your address.
* Check your wallet is actually up to date. Some require a couple of minutes to update.
For more help you need to provide some more info:
* Which exchange?
* Which wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:41:43
I see it has confirmed.  
Let's say the customer had gone offline with their wallet.  If the fee was lower it may never have confirmed and the transaction would have been forgotten by the network. 
If they had come online (or stayed online) it would probably have been rebroadcast by them to the network so it would have keep floating around.
Bitcoin-core allows you to delete unconfirmed transactions which would stop it from rebroadcasting.  As soon as the network forgets the transaction the user would then be able to spend the bitcoin again.

It also incentivises behaviour that is counter productive to rest of network.  It may have been an hidden incentive to stop SegWit which was beneficial to all except that it stopped asic boost.   Overt asic boost causes less of an issue.

Resources does not affect whether you can do it or not.  It's available to whoever has the right equipment.

People should answer truthfully how much they have (and it appears none have) because any true answer is likely to make you the target of scammers/hackers.

Impossible that this will happen at the same time.  Blocks on the two chains won' t be found at the same time.

US only?
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:49:42
No, the hash rate is only signalling BU not actually running BU nodes.  That would be far too risky.

Maybe they don't accept bitcointalk.org links?  Would fit the typical rhetoric from them.

Well in this case ANT Miner may have sold miners to another company with the patented tech included.  So I'd guess the buyer could just use it.  They did not advertise the feature though...

About 600 nodes added only in the US?  Inside an hour or so.  Seems dodgy.

Not sure.  It's not clear to me how these operate.  There is potential because if they are not they may be infringing some patents in China or elsewhere.  Not sure if that's a huge practical problem though.

I think he is trying to do what he says:  Think from the view point of both sides, in a detached way, with an aim to ensure the security of bitcoin.

The blocks are invalid and get ignored by the network (as if they never were found).  Any transactions are treated as if they were not mined and kept in mempool until they are included in another block.
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:34:32
The block size LIMIT is 1MB.  It means if the block is full it would be 1MB.  Earlier blocks were not full and therefore smaller than 1MB.
The earliest blocks usually had just one 1 transaction in them.  So it does slow down for newer blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:12:35
This is exactly what the post is not about. It's about thinking about other implications of one's actions and approach.

What's most interesting now is how many are signaliing bit1 (Segwit).
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:48:19
First ensure that you use a wallet which estimates fees correctly as you should not wait that long.   Bitcoin Core is also improving fee estimates to give better guidance on how to set fees given the confirmation time required.
Secondly scaling is set to improve with:
* SegWit change will double effective transaction capacity.  This should hopefully be out by end 2018 (or even by this August if all works out).
* SegWit will enable off chain protocols like Lightning Network which allows for faster transactions.
* Potential for further block increases down the road.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:17:34
Ant miners have it AFAIK.  It's a hidden feature.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:07:02
Demand = Users wanting confirmed transactions
Supply = Miners selling space in blocks (service or product whatever you want to call it)
Price = Fee / byte
That's a market.  You also see as demand rises (as mempool increases) the price rises.  If you fee (price) is too low you can RBF or you can submit to miner directly and pay a premium for guaranteed or faster confirmation than your fee permits.

The bit I like below.  Applies to many people with different views:


financial interests, and when they look over the list archives your actions may call into question whether due care was taken here, should that become relevant.
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:22:56
Is you transaction already broadcast? Increasing fees only works if the transaction is already visible. Most likely the delay is within Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:44:09
Accidental or experiments when BTC wasn't worth that much.

I guess there are definitely the bankers willing to make a buck off anyone. 
There are also lots of regulations that are quite difficult to comply with in practice to the letter which makes it a risk reward thing.  The lawmakers are usually not thinking much about implementation when they write those laws.  Fin. services companies try to comply but it's not always possible to do 100%.  Systems fail and/or people fail even more.  Laws are also complex and conflicting for multi-nationals as EU law might say one thing and US another. 
So they do what they can to reduce risk by implenting processes/systems, but I suspect if they can avoid those implementations because "it's on a blockchain" (whatever that may mean to them) they might also use that to reduce the risk of non-compliance in that way.

Lot's of comments of [BU blocks being mined]( while all their nodes are down.
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:20:58
Bitcoin is a system of no trust and it's a public system.  Nodes don't trust each other and the information exchanged between each other is public anyway.  
There is no point in encrypting the connections on the p2p network.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:10:02
That that was all about trying to convince them about how there implementation is leaving SPV wallets at risk. The really was directed at someone responding without thinking. I wanted to not bring a particular slant to things as the comment is all about setting the other's view at least theoretically to assess the risks. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:10:14
The [bdf129...]( is the transaction ID.  
If you click on that you can see the transaction was made it includes paying 0.025 to [1KE6P...](  
But you also paid several other addresses the same amount.  It would appear that your change address (another address in your wallet) is [36Qw99...]( but I might be wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-28 04:56:03
May be the reason
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:48:08
That's what I never get. Miners should be pro small blocks. Saves them effort and guarantees higher fees.
