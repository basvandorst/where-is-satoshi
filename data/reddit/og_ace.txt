High five, guys.
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:52:29
Ah, much easier on the eyes.
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:36:01
Wait, so why would anyone buy bitcoin in an atm, and not on coinbase? 
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:15:44
I could have made my first gain, albeit small, and still can I think, too lazy to check coinbase.com, for over $100 (I bought uno bitcoino at 500), but I just want bitcoin, man. I just want my bitcoin and I love it
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:01:20
Ah, Linux is a good one. So it is a wonderful technology. I now understand. I admit that I was wrong. Thank you guys for the insight.
But this is a challenge. I am an open minded person who knows computers as much as the back of his own hand. It took a one on one discussion just to get me to see clearly. How the fuck are the others, who cannot navigate through Microsoft Word or figure out basic things on their own accept bitcoin, bittorrent, openbazaar, and all of this? Openbazaar has to be easier than bittorrent or steam or ebay, I think. Do you guys like the steam idea? In browser, of course. Downloading something probably would not be too good for most people, although I personally would much rather have a killer program that is the openbazaar, then you pick what server you want (as do not know what a node is, but I assume that you can't have, almost like mmo servers, separate stores on separate servers, like different malls with stores inside, in order to make this possible, if it cannot be done on one big marketplace) and can make a "shop", and if you have enough business going in, you can upgrade to a "store". Shops would be for selling person items like you would at a garage sale or on ebay. Stores would be like actual businesses that produce more massively. How do you guys feel about these ideas? Am I on the same page as you guys? Am I looking too far forward? Am I way off?
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:42:15
This is probably bullshit. I just bought 0.14 BTC for the hell of it anyway.
@_date: 2014-09-17 00:56:09
This is actually important. One early adopter can make the amount go higher than ever. But there is little he can do about the number.
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:55:55
I wish it was worth $200. That's a healthy number for 1 BTC. It looks right to me. If it was worth $200, I'd be put half of my savings in it.
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:17:40
Yeah I'm curious too. Do people actually believe the news outside of the US?
@_date: 2014-10-29 03:24:37
Why would they do this. So what is real. Are you saying 1 BTC is actually 100,000,000 bitcoin?

As an outsider to this situation with no bias, I say give him a second chance. He seems needed at this time. Seems to have transparency. I like it. Better than anyone else. Is this guy the President or something? What is going on?
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:32:14
The reason most people do not like bittorrent is because there is very little legal use.. at all. You can share your files using anything else, and you do not have to download anything. If you want to share a file to a massive amount of people, you are either selling something, which bittorrent is the worst thing to use for that, or you are giving it away. You could count using only your fingers the amount of massively distributed free software there are that do not already have their own website. In fact, I would need some help here. I can only think of one. Music, and that is only for the artist to decide if that is free. Can you list for reddit any other legitimate files?
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:05:21
I do this a lot. Is this bad? 
@_date: 2014-11-02 09:19:32
Give 1 redditgold to someone for me, will ya? @_date: 2014-11-24 02:58:12
Yes. I get kind of mad when someone tips me less than a dollar depending on the situation. I see too much of a negative outcome if outsiders see such meaningless amounts. If it was one on one in secret, I may laugh, but in public you have to be aware of the consequences.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:57:34
How would they compete against ad block? It's probably not a good idea to let the whole world know that you have an option to not see ads. The huge amount of people who already use ad block are toxic enough
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:18:10
I hit yes. I read how it works. Could I create an encrypted file on my computer? Nope. But I do understand how the behind the scenes works. I drilled that shit into my head and I hated reading all of it. But I wanted to know before I bought any BTC. I'm still a noob, but if I am not considered someone who understands bitcoin at a technical level, then, no one does, realistically. The very few that understand it so well that they could create an alt coin today are all here, though. But that is just unrealistic. I know how BTC works more than I do USD, and I took basic economics in HS and the first college macro economics.
TL;DR I am by no means an expert. That is a laughable thought. But if I don't know BTC at a technical level, then very very VERY few do compared to the populations. I clicked yes because I read a the pdf, stopped reading the pdf to learn about some tough concepts, then went back and finished the pdf.

What? Are you telling me that you watch the news on TV and think those people are more credible than children? That is why I come to reddit. Even if the original post of some news is a lie, it will be figured out by the end of the day. On TV, you may never know the difference between a lie and a truth. I will believe many people digging for the truth and posting their findings over a big name news agency any day.

So unless it goes less than 400, you probably shouldn't expect to get any significant return by buying at anytime.
Except! What the fuck happened to cause it to go from 500 to over 1000? And how come it didn't stay up there?

Don't pull a Riot Games and make a program that you hope to be popular, but turns out to be 1000x more popular than expected, and have your program have the shittiest of foundations that it is too big and you can't fix it without redoing, which you can't do because of time.

The problem is that people will tip less than a dollars worth. It is pathetic. I make $10 an hour, live on my own, am currently paying for medical examinations for my heart, yet I have no problem giving at least a couple dollars each time. I guess people would rather eat out everyday or something so they have no money. But no matter if you can afford it or not... why tip at all if it is less than a dollar? I would be more happy for a smile than a bunch of pennies. Now a bill? Okay I'll take that kindly. Anything less makes me feel like I'm a joke. Don't get me started with people donating in hundreds of bits. Like seriously? Don't make fun of me with that shit.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:34:17
I'm so dumb. I was thinking that you can't see how many ad views you get if there are no ads. VIEWS. My bad. And what I meant by twitch was the subscribing to each streamer.

Just first hand. You are literally the first I have ever heard of that is using it to not get free games and music. And I am one of the most tech nerds that are not in the tech business. I know more than most. Can fix any problem unless it is hardware. I am not trained. I've never had a tech job of any kind. But for people who are not in that universe, I know so much more than them. If you are surprised that others do not know of legitimate uses of bittorrent, please know that you are apart of a small, select group. We do not need to get people like you into bitcoin. You are smart enough to get into it without our persuasion. It is the vast majority that are not like you who we need to get on board. Without them, bitcoin will continue to be insignificant. Until we get the kind of people who have trouble with email into bitcoin, we will be missing a much needed chunk of people.
This chunk of people are the people who hear bittorrent and think of file-sharing. Who think of file-sharing and think of illegal activities.
It does not matter how much you know bittorrent is great. That means nothing when everyone else thinks it is bad news.

I'm confused about this whole backup business. I only have about .1 bitcoin, and I want to see bitcoin grow (I only have a couple thousand monies, anyways, so I can't invest too much). I just have a coinbase account (which, in my mind, is like have a Bank of America account). I just found out this morning through reddit about a wallet you can have on your computer (qt), and there was some jabbel about hard cold storage? THIS FINALLY LEADS TO MY QUESTION: Am I missing some very important information that I need to know, when I eventually invest 1 BTC or more?
Edit: I said a sentence twice.
@_date: 2014-09-22 03:39:05
Bitcoin is like money. I do not get how you brought bittorrent into this, and bittorrent has bad reputation with legitimacy. We are making bitcoin legit, not a shady option.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:51:25
I think you are forgetting the amount of people who use ad block. And why would an optional tip go against any rules?
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:47:26
Well, you are using the reddit vote system incorrectly. Downvoting is not for disagreeing. Instead, add a comment and explain your side of the argument.
@_date: 2014-09-22 01:38:45
Bittorrent would be a terrible analogy for people to talk about. We want to promote bitcoin, not taint its name.

Okay there are probably a lot of people like me. I don't know shit. Sure, I can donate, but I make $10 an hour and live on my own (I make it because Texas is cheap rent... and I buy literally nothing but what food keeps me alive). Is this even on Windows? This will *never* take off if it isn't. I imagine this to be Steam. It can be included, no doubt, but, instead of games, just buying local fruits for you to pick up, a used car, a pack of computer paper, a hockey stick, a bucket of paint, blue jeans, Target gift cards that you got from mother fucking family members that think you shop at target that you really need to sell because you are tired of looking at them, fuck it- go ahead and run your own eye glasses and contact lens shop, Mundo's Shoe Shop, hat wear, lipstick, tour services up this mountain that your nigga ass wants to climb, alarm clock, shit- anything. That's what I envision. Is that what this is? Steam for life? Because, as long as there are customer reviews embedded in this, and of course a rating system, and it's on Windows, this will work without a doubt. But what can I do right now, besides donating what little I have? I work a lot. I don't have much time. I could be a consumer, but, from what I am reading on the top reddit posts about this, you guys are almost a year from this. It is taking forever. Just put a buggy ass system for me to spend 0.02 btc on some shit I don't need so I can help test this system. Draw your god damn dick on a piece of paper put it on openbazaar, and I'll buy that shit. Let's fucking go already.

Yes, but only if you accept that you burned that $180 to ashes with a match. This is how I make all my investments, anyway. I do not expect the money back. You can be excited if you get a huge gain from it, but don't be sad if it all goes away. You sound like you have 0 income. $180 isn't that much. Almost half a week's paycheck. So although you might lose everything, once you get a job, it's almost like you lost nothing. I'd do it.
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:40:38
Sorry for being a noob here, I'm one of those people who only read how crypto currency and the bitcoin protocol works, but I don't even know how to handle bitcoin other than have a coinbase account. Although anyone can make easy assumptions, what does "funded" mean? Once it is funded, is the product morphed from a $120 object into a $20 shell/old bitcoin home and piece of art? Does it just mean the $100 is spent? Can you move the bitcoin to coinbase? To another wallet? Can you "rejuice" this physical coin? How does this work.

Looks fine to me. Maybe have an option on the top right to toggle. Maybe in orange (people will be looking for the red x when they can't comprehend the decimals, which is so much easier once you get used to it anyways, so you want a color close to red but the same theme as bitcoin) and have it say, "can't take the price format? Make it newbie friendly". Niggas can click and get numbers without dots.

Whoa. I did not realize people actually had a million dollars besides old, evil white men. (I've been staring at my screen for a good 60 seconds now, still in shock). What. I could start a business. My mom's business as a pet salon. I could sponsor *myself* so I can do nothing but work 80 hours a week becoming the best League of Legends player possible and be the next, big, serious competition, and then start making a surplus with that career. I could then become a coach for a team, one of the first coaches like Regi. I could make some serious investments in stock. I could be free to do what I think is important without spending most of my time making shakes for customers. Whoa. Dude you gotta make sure you take some good finance classes. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer for good reason. But you inherited it; you are only neutral (I don't know you, so you could already know, but you are only 18, so *probably* got some fine tuning to do). Learn the ways of good investment and help out the world.

Sucks dude, but try to use more common sense. If you live in the US, you have absolutely no excuse, for there is coinbase. If you live elsewhere, just do your research and stick with what has worked all this time. This kind of thing does not happen to everybody for a reason. Don't try to be adventurous here because, if you are not *the* smartest person in the room, you will get your shit stolen.

I'm one of those people in the "knows more about computers than anybody in his community" category, but only read the cryptography Wikipedia page because it was required to read the how the bitcoin protocol works essay.

Have you ever stepped out of you're own neighborhood? Half of my friends had to be begged to getting a bank account.

@_date: 2015-04-15 03:03:43
The way I see it is: people will never take bitcoin seriously if it is any higher than $200. Unless it goes lower, nobody will even want to by it. Chill out bro. I'm just in it for the concept, not easy money. I've hated how it's been sitting higher than $200 for so long.

It would be so much more convenient to use bitcoin. Getting mugged wouldn't do much and you can still have all your money. Gas station cashiers would not have to fear getting threatened. Paying your bills would be sent in in less than ten minutes. You could lend money to anybody you want so they can buy yugioh cards, even when they ask you as they are in line at the store. No more in-game, store only, points, just use bitcoin. No more waiting for services when services want to wait to see if the money goes through. I already use it for porn. I don't even watch porn anymore. But fuck, nobody else wants my money.

Hey guys,
I signed up, gave them access to my coinbase, gave them my name, address, phone number, social security number, $10 worth of bitcoin, and I got an email requesting a color photo of my driver's license, and asking if my phone number is for my home or work.
Now they have my reddit profile.
Is this even real? How much info does a bank need? How could they do this in a more trusting way?
I trust coinbase purely because I like them, but is this too much?
The only way I can fathom this is fake is if it's a bunch of psychopaths taking "stealing bitcoin" to a whole new level and trying to steal as many identities as possible.
I'm drunk and I think I should have waited until tomorrow to look into this.
Hoping to get some thoughts from people who are smarter and wiser.
