Fellow redditors as we are the bitcoin community, not much of the percentage. In this thread be careful what you say never let the other person know your next move. Don’t say what you bought in at how much you have or anything to that extent it give people the upper hand. Suck on that!

I had a question about taxes maybe someone can help. When you say trade how do you go about paying taxes. I trade to make small gains often I just wonder i taxes are going to bite me in the ass at the end of the year for doing so many small trades.

Well first off don’t come off as a butthole and maybe you’ll get a answer. Here’s my honest answer NOBODY it’s a gamble either way you look at it you want to make some quick money follow macfees twitter and buy any shit coin he promotes.

@_date: 2018-06-10 17:47:17
Personally ide rather see macfee eat his butthole since he is so full of shit 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:02:06
Let me see i can call it this time i say 3500$ bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:45:49
I told you someone always calls it good prediction.
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:32:43
The opposite way
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:40:01
There’s always one person in this thread that’s spot on about predictions. Not the same person but someone is always spot on.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:23:21
It’s being manipulated right big time wait for a bigger drop.

I gotta day now that my bitcoin is sold I’m worrying about other things like what’s up with the upvotes on this chat people? I upvote when I see good comments pass it along my fellow cryptopians.

My current feels about bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:45:38
I like the idea but sounds damn near impossible without one of the whales finding out. You would have to background check everyone I’m not saying it can’t be done just difficult. Like some underground type of notice or something so it’s low key.
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:37:03
I’m not selling hodl gang 
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:35:27
I agree I have no idea what is going to happen now whether up or down. I personally feel like it has To go down for it to go up cause right now it’s just stagnant. That or either it stays like this for a while. My last thought is the whales have to invest to make the price go up and then everyone else will hop in and follow but then again so many people are down that the whales know when they manipulate the price people will cash out sooner since so many people are at a loss right now.

We are in the BB era.      A.k.a (Boring Bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:14:05
There’s only around 50 people who own the large majority of bitcoin. They have to get bored or collaborate or something for this to go up. We found a price point 7800-8100 I believe that is the only solution. The craze is over.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:10:48
I have a feeling this will be the biggest drop by far ladies and germalmen. Yes germalmen.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:21:27
Hodl me tightly while bitcoin goes down.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:30:06
Ya don’t forget to send $500 of your bitcoin to the African prince for his funds to be released and then send you 20k for your help.
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:38:29
I agree I’m just use to seeing it do something drastic I guess i actually sleep better at night the little I do while it’s been steady. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:13:11
I can’t say I haven’t spread fud but I do have to comment on your long post about cutting it down. I am a very large (small) investor in crypto and I do think what we say has something to do with the way people look at crypto therefore I will keep my best foot forward as you say and hopefully everyone else does to so the others can see this isn’t a game and we are serious investors and that crypto is actually worth something and not a joke. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:33:15
What I don’t understand is how will bitcoin or any alt coin be used to pay for anything when it’s so volatile. Say you take a payment in whichever coin pick your favorite and then the price dips like super fast then what? Also say you want to cash out your crypto don’t you have to pay a fee like thru Coinbase or Gemini? So it isn’t really free payment after all is it?
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:26:23
Ya and if not, it always worth seeing macfee eat his own dick.
