Wtf? Red wine? Are you saying there could be 1000 different answers how to create a paper wallet? Like everyone has a different opinion on how to create one. What a nonsense example. 
If you google paper wallet it will tell you how to create a paper wallet. It's that simple.

Can you idiots stop posting the same thing over and over again?
I bet we are going to have to read this shit all week. And then when it's actually there we're gonna have to read about that for 3 more weeks. 
This on top of the 200 articles about it that have been posted over the last months. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:51:10
Thanks for posting this 2 weeks old news which has been posted about 37 times already. 
Also another great site you found again. 
Just leave it up to you go repost last weeks news on the most obscure sites on the net. 
There is something seriously wrong with you dude. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:19:16
Why ask it if you can find the answer within 2 seconds using Google?
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:37:02
Can someone explain to me why this post is downvoted? Is there anything not to agree with? Do i lie? Am i rude? Am i saying anything or wrong in that post?
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:54:59
Do a goddamn search! This has been answered a million times!
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:31:33
Uh yes, you cleary did. Otherwise you would not be with a closed account now.
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:14:40
If you can link it and i can read it how exactly is it deleted?
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:57:47
I'm trying really hard but i seriously can't think of anything more sad and pathetic than virtually downvoting someone on the internet because you don't agree with that person. Seriously, what a sad fucking life one must have if you actually do that. It's scary that people live that way. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:18:58
Just stop making up excuses man. Posting the same story 10 times is silly. Period. 
I'm quite sure 90% of the people here will agree with that. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:35:14
What is there possibly to downvote in the above post?
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:22:57
That would be great. My bitcoins would be worth so much. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:38:32
Oh no! That will teach me. Yup, you got me this time! I'm totally fucked!
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:54:49
You kids are really sensative, aren't you. 
Real life must be a hell for you if you consider someone suggesting a google search as a bad attitude which must be downvoted. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:00:24
Thanks for posting this. Most of us missed it the 50 times before you posted this. 
Make sure not to use the search again before you post next time. We wouldn't want to miss out on your "news". 
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:54:57
Wrong subreddit. This is the Bitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 13:05:06
Here is another post you can downvote out of pure frustration. That will teach me! Being virtually downvoted on the world wide web! What will i do with my life now that a few 16 year olds downvoted me!!!
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:53:30
Fuck, you're an idiot. 
And also piss off with your begging. Why would anybody want to send you money? Are we supposed to feel sorry for you?
Some people deserve to get sued. You are one of them. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 13:02:38
Ah, no answer of course, just more downvoting. Haha the frustration of you kids is just hilarious. The only thing they can do is hit that downvote button. And it drives them nuts! Just kill yourself already. Sad fucking idiots. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:41:00
Ok, you are new to Bitcoin. But are you also new to Google? Or just extremely lazy and you want other people to do all the work for you?
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:02:15
Don't you think posting the same story 10 times is just a little bit stupid?
News moves fast. There is new news every day. Should a newspaper print yesterdays stories again? Just in case some people missed it the first time?
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:23:44
Oh you got me! I'm so busted!
I'm not exactly hiding, you dumb fuck. I deleted my old account. Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:03:24
Stop it man. It's been posted 10 times already. We get it. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:56:11
How old are you? You are pretty clueless, aren't you?
@_date: 2013-10-27 06:58:16
Awesome man. The same story that has been posted 20 times already but with some extra bullshit in it. 
You are good at this internet thing!
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:52:05
This happened a day ago or so. You can't possibly think this has not been posted 10 times already. Why do you people refuse to use the search?
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:21:21
Let me guess. You read several warnings from people who ran into problems with Paypal for selling Bitcoin related items. 
You thought fuck it, i'm gonna do it anyway because i'm special and this won't happen to me. Of course it did happen to you and now you come crying here. 
Am i close?
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:05:19
Funny how that group of people that every day insist on posting non Bitcoin articles always find a way to link it to Bitcoin. 
Do you realize you could do this with basically any random article you can find?
It's annoying. People come to this subreddit to read about Bitcoin. If they want to read about something else they would go somewhere else. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:01:31
He's a criminal who tried to have people killed. Get over it man. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:25:20
Why do you say no if i was exactly right?
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:59:32
This has been posted about 5 times today. How can you possibly think you were the first to post this. Are you new here? Don't you know that you should look or search before posting?
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:56:41
This has been posted several times already. 
Why don't you look at the page or do a search next time before posting. So you won't end up being that annoying prick that reposts the same thing next time. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:22:24
We know. It's been posted many times already. You can stop now. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:31:27
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:53:19
You still don't make sense. 
Edit: i understand it now. 
He deleted it be because he realized it already was posted. Something could've realized as well if you did a search. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:59:47
This must be one of the most stupid things i read in a long time.
