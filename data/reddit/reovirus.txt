This is ahistorical. Germany had a welfare state before the Nazis (since Bismarck) and during the Nazi era. You can find speeches by Hitler where he explicitly talks about the importance of the welfare state and makes fun of countries like England that are "only now" (in the 30s and 40s) discovering what Germany discovered in the 19th century (the importance of the welfare state).
The Nazis rose to power because humans are shit. Asset forfeiture and IRS policies are also because humans are shit. People like to think of Leonardo da Vinci when they think of a human. The reality is that a human is a child soldier in Rwanda hacking the head off another child soldier.

Cody Wilson will go down as one of the most important figures in the history of human liberty. If you haven't downloaded the designs, do so while you still can.
It's sad this happened to him, but not surprising. I don't know if he actually did it or not, but the point is that it doesn't matter. Whether it was a successful honeytrap or made to look like one, for most people he'll just look guilty.
If you read this, Cody, thanks for everything you did and all you sacrificed. I hope you've put enough bitcoin away that you can disappear and enjoy a long happy life. If anyone is advising you to turn yourself in, don't listen to them. You'll just become another Ross. The government doesn't care if you're guilty. They only want you dead or in prison. Get away and have the happy retirement you've earned.
The last two interviews I heard from Cody Wilson were on The Ralph Retort's Killstream and Dick Masterson's The Dick Show. I highly recommend listening to both of them.
Incidently, a little advice for all of you: no one you sleep with should ever know your name or how to find you.

First of all, in case you're actually unaware, most of the people who defend Ross don't believe he actually ordered hits. We think the government fabricated those chats.
But even if you believe Ross ordered 6 people killed, that's far, far fewer than the number of people ordered killed by Nelson Mandela. There's hardly any debate about who Mandela was, but the lack of debate is on exactly the wrong side.
So what I'm saying is: even if you believe the worst about Ross, Ross Ulbricht is a much better person than Nelson Mandela. If Nelson Mandela can be considered a hero and an icon, then so can Ross Ulbricht.
Well done, Ross. If you're ever released, I hope you pull a Mandela and become fucking president of the USA.

Do you think Hitler wanted war with the intention that Germany would win the war and be better off than it was before? Or do you think Hitler wanted war with the intention that Germany would lose the war and be virtually destroyed and occupied? The origin of this discussion was whether or not Hitler/The Nazis wanted to "save Germany" (from their point of view). I'm surprised that's even up for debate, but I suspect people are confused about what the actual point of contention is.

Historically I think it's fair to say Hitler and the Nazis intended to "save Germany." Germany was in terrible economic shape after WW1 and Germans were an oppressed minority in neighboring states. The Nazis did manage to stage an economic revival and restore German pride -- for a while. In the end, obviously, Hitler almost destroyed Germany.
It's not so different from Germany today. Merkel and her followers obviously think they're doing something good for Germany. (Merkel's policies can also be considered "expansionist" [controlling Europe via the EU] and "racial" [pushing migrants into Poland so Poland won't be so "disgustingly white"].) People looking back decades from now will make the judgment about whether or not it was actually good. I mean, it probably won't be called Germany at that point, but you get the idea.

You realize you're saying they were oppressed, but that they brought it on themselves by being troublemakers, right? I'm not sympathetic to the Germans. Frankly I think the Czechs did the right thing by finally kicking the ethnic Germans out after WW2, even though it was essentially ethnic cleansing. There was more oppression of the German minority in western Poland (which actually was part of Germany before WW1). Saying "go back to Germany" doesn't work very well when the borders change.
I'll be brief about economics. First, the economy was historically bad during Weimar, a point I assume we would agree on. All the Nazis had to do was be not-worse-than-Weimar to be considered a "revival" -- a low bar. The Nazis instituted public works programs, similar to what FDR was doing in the US at the same time. My understanding is that this reduced unemployment and provided a temporary boost to the economy. But I'm no expert. And I oppose those policies, both when implemented by FDR and by Hitler. The real "Wirtschaftswunder" came *after* WW2 with the pro-market reforms of Erhard. Don't get the impression I'm pro-Nazi, or pro-socialism in any form. I'm not.


I can see I've really upset you. I'm not a supporter of Trump, but I take great pleasure in how much emotional difficulty he is causing people -- especially the people who've made excuses for "leaders" like Merkel or Obama in the recent past. The way I described the current European situation is accurate. You know it and I know it. Germany is the dominant member of the EU. There is no denying that. Merkel alone invited the refugees. She did so explicitly. And Germans have reelected her (sort of) since that happened. That was a German policy forced onto Europe. Deny it all you want, everyone saw it happen. Then when too many came, Germany used their influence on EU institutions to try to force migrant quotas on neighboring countries like Poland and the Czech Republic. These countries are perfectly willing to tell Merkel and the Germans, you know what, fuck off. On the other hand, I don't think these countries are actually willing to leave the EU over it, so there will be a conflict for a long time. It's a conflict the Germans started, again.
The reality is that Germany survived Hitler, barely. History will show whether Germany survives Merkel.
I wish being 'anti-fascist' were the norm. With most people if they see someone who looks like them who makes passionate speeches saying "we're stronger together" and that we should "move forward" but it's only those backwards idiots who are "holding us back" -- most people cheer them. The only difference seems to be which "leaders" do you think looks right and who do you think the backwards idiots are. Sometimes someone will stand up and say: "We're stronger if we individually follow our own paths and forge our own destinies!" to no effect. Fundamentally, people like fascism. They like to feel part of a group and blame all their problems on that other group. So basically, to sum up, fuck people.

Well, Breivik actually did kill people, unlike Ross. But it's a shame Breivik comes up so often. I'm afraid if people think he's representative of the movement he considered himself a part of, then there might be a backlash. It's important to remember that the *vast* majority of the people critical of European policies and trends are peaceful people who would never harm anyone. Breivik was just an exception. Just like how a few suicide bombers are not representative of the ideology they represent.

Not proven. The veracity of the evidence is disputed. Ultimately people believe what they want to believe.

If you already want to believe Ross is a good guy, you'll default to believing the evidence was fabricated by bad guys in the government. (And some of the government agents were admitted to be "bad guys" by the government themselves.)

I didn't say it was "all Hitler wanted." It was more about explaining the context in which the Nazis came to power. Hitler didn't give speeches saying, "Vote for me and I'll bring you years of war and a massive genocide!" Though his speeches definitely talked a lot about the "deplorable Jews" -- or wait, I think it's translated as "eternal Jew." Something like that. Fortunately politicians don't demonize their political opponents like that these days.

The simple things he or she has posted here would get him or her in legal trouble in many European countries, including Germany.

Gee, I don't mean to end up defending the Nazis. I largely agree with what you've said. My main point was that the Nazis *thought* they were doing something positive to "save Germany," and there was evidence they could've interpreted as them being successful (at first). I don't think someone could easily support the idea that the Nazis were intending to harm Germany and purposefully pushed policies they thought would harm Germany.

Yes, I don't get this either. Some people think that the EU has something to do with it just because the European Court of Justice, an arm of the EU, is attempting to force unwilling states like Poland to accept "migrant" quotas. I guess Poles really are dumb if they think there's a relationship between Poland belonging to the EU and an arm of the EU enforcing "migrant" quotas on Poland.
The really strange thing to me is why states like Germany, the Netherlands and France would want to send any migrants away. After all, most of the migrants are doctors and lawyers who will only benefit their society, so Poland would just be missing out on those benefits. People get distracted by incidents like the murder of Theo van Gogh, the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the Bataclan massacre, the unfortunate incidents in Nice and Berlin, the rape and murder of Maria Ladenburger, and so on. If Poles were as smart as the Germans, French and Dutch, they'd know the benefits of having "migrants" far outweighs a few isolated incidents like those. I mean, have Poles never tasted Middle Eastern cuisine? I think we can all agree, it's better to have a thousand Maria Ladenburgers be raped and murdered than have one fewer kebab place.

Many people (including me) see what Ross did as a "victimless crime" and think he shouldn't be in prison.

I hope he is freed someday, one way or another.

If it's "one time" then why is "events" plural? The truth is, as you know, there have been many incidents of rape and murder in Germany as a direct result of Merkel's policies. And to be clear, Merkel is in power because of you and people like you.
Maria Ladenburger was raped and murdered because of you.
You, like most Germans, deal with this by reassuring yourself of what good people you are, especially compared to those horrible racist barbaric Polish people next door.
And everyone knows, including you, that Merkel is importing millions of people who hate the Jews. Your attitudes are no different from those of your grandparents. You still think you're superior. And you're still racists. And you're still making decisions that will lead to the deaths of millions in the future.

I assume they (and/or other government agencies) asked for all information that Coinbase has and Coinbase turned it all over (and continues to do so). The reason I assume this is that Coinbase hasn't ended up like Lavabit. Nothing has changed since Lavabit, because more people are OK with the government having unlimited power.

There are good arguments for being strategic in what we say. I assume that's why many otherwise intelligent people say things that are obviously false. It's better strategy to say the false thing.
But in this case, I don't think the strategy of playing make-believe is going to work.
Imagine if the Brits had acted in WW2 like they're acting now. Imagine their natural reaction to being bombed had been to shame someone who said "fucking Nazi cunts!" by responding, "Hey, that's ignorant. This isn't Nazis doing this. Naziism is a peaceful ideology." Then the badbrit pulls out Mein Kampf and starts quoting from it. The goodbrit says they're cherry picking and inciting racial hatred. The next day the badbrit is arrested for racial hatred. That night there's another bombing. The next week there's a concert for love and unity, making no mention of Naziism or Nazis. There is no doubt in my mind Britain would have lost, and would have *deserved to lose*.

When there was yet another attack during the recent campaign, Macron called the problem of terrorism "imponderable" -- which basically means "don't think about it." That's my advice.

The conversation has died down now, but I decide to run some basic numbers for you.
Paris has about 2 million people in it. In the past 2.5 years, about 200 people have been killed in terrorist attacks. So, roughly 1 in 10000 will be killed in a terrorist attack in Paris in a 2.5 year period. 2.5 years is roughly 1000 days. So for each day you are in Paris, there is basically a 1 in 10 million chance one of you will be killed in a terrorist attack. Hope this helps.
For comparison, there have been 0 terror attacks in Prague, a city of about a million people. Those are infinitely better odds.

Yes, to Paris and Prague. I've been to Paris a handful of times over the past decade or so. (I'm not French, but used to live in France, about two hours outside of Paris.) I was never directly affected by a terrorist attack, but looking around it was obvious what was happening to the city, and France in general. Everyone knows it, especially the ones who deny it the most. Frankly, when absolutely nothing changed after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, I stopped even feeling sorry for anyone killed in France. They're kind of OK with it apparently. 
If you were asking about Prague, I've been there a few times in recent years. It's beautiful, and I'd highly recommend visiting. If you look around in Prague, it's also completely obvious they don't have the same problems France has (and Germany and Britain and the Netherlands and Belgium and Sweden have). That's not to say Prague is culturally homogeneous. There are people from all over the civilized world living in Prague. The key adjective being "civilized."

Yes, it's a good thing Le Pen was defeated. I was worried the French might actually start opposing what's happening. It's a good thing that truck got dodged. I mean, didn't get dodged. The point is that it's Nicer to get run over by a truck than to vote for Le Pen. We can all agree on that.
