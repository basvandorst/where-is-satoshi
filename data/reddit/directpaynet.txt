The Green Sheet interviewed me for this article, here's the excerpt:
**Merchant accounts**
A handful of ISOs and merchant level salespeople are working with businesses that want to accept virtual currencies. Maria Sparagis, Chief Executive Officer at DirectPayNet, said much of the demand comes from high-risk businesses. "I'm seeing merchants who are unable to obtain merchant accounts because of poor credit or financial issues, or who find card acceptance unfeasible because of high reserves imposed by acquirers," she said. These merchants are looking for alternative currencies like bitcoin because constraints to acceptance are limited.
"Also, bitcoin is a final payment so there is no risk of chargebacks to the merchant," she said. And although the fees charged for processing bitcoin transactions are minimal (less than PayPal Inc., proponents like to point out), opportunities exist for value-adds, like up-to-the-minute exchange rates, added security and currency choices, Sparagis noted.
DirectPayNet, which specializes in e-commerce transactions, primarily serves merchants in Canada, Europe and South America. The company acts as a direct agent for several acquiring banks in Europe and South America, and as a reseller for several U.S. ISOs, Sparagis said.
A big push for virtual currencies could come from businesses looking to grow internationally. "Bitcoin is growing in popularity in places where there is a lot of economic corruption and limited banking services," Sparagis added.

Hi! I am wondering if you have a reseller program? I have not been able to find a Bitcoin payment solution that offers an agent program.  I currently offer merchant accounts in several international jurisdictions and would like to offer a Bitcoin payment solution to my clients. I appreciate your feedback.
