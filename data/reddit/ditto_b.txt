Bitcoin isn't for everyone. As a professional in a developed nation, the existing fiat-based system works perfectly for your needs. You don't need to use Bitcoin since you have nothing to gain from doing so (apart from speculation/daytrading/etc.).
You need to realize, however, that this doesn't apply to a *lot* of people. Billions of people worldwide have no access to banks or financial institutions. Quite a few more find it impossible to get a credit card. In a lot of developing countries, inflation is so bad that it's almost pointless holding local currency. People choose to hold gold or USD (and most exchanges operate illegally) simply since there is no other store of value.
They are the people who would actually benefit from crypto currency, not you.

The fee isn't much of an issue given that feeless transactions regularly get mined as long as they aren't too large in size (&gt; 1KB) or otherwise "spammy". Even if that's not the case, you can transfer a few million dollars for ~$0.08 in fees.
Double spends aren't a massive issue either. Companies like Bitpay and coinbase already accept zero-conf transactions and absorb the double-spend risk on behalf of merchants. On the other hand, for a higher-value transaction (like buying a car or a house) the buyer probably won't mind hanging around for his tx to confirm a few times.

c) Yeah, that's what I meant. He still has your coins but it's more transparent this way
Bots like ALTcointip use offchain transactions and work just as well as bitcointip so there's not a massive difference either way.
To me personally, the ability to spend money that I've received as tips directly from Bitcoin-qt or blockchain.info is a nice feature to have. But it requires a tradeoff in that offchain tipbots will always require tx fees.

Yeah, so the volatility is not inherent to Bitcoin. It's not like there's something built into the protocol that always guarantees X amount of volatility.

I use ESET on my Windows PC but I don't know how good the Mac version is.
As far as BTC goes, however, the safest thing you can do is keep your private keys offline. Some people use paper wallets, others use a dedicated always-offline computer running an offline wallet (old laptop/Raspberry Pi/etc.). Not sure what software they use but I know Electrum has offline wallet capabilities.
Hardware wallets are a good option but they're not ready for consumer use yet afaik.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:13:32
* The merchant can detect most double spends within a few seconds (i.e before the customer leaves).
* Even though it doesn't require hashpower to double spend against a merchant that accepts 0-conf payments, setting one up isn't exactly trivial.
Therefore the actual risk of someone successfully double spending against the merchant should be low enough for them to absorb the risk in a restaurant/bar setting.
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:57:34
Tor or VPN wouldn't change the fact that your transactions are publicly logged. Services like Mixers/tumblers and coinjoin (or a system like Zerocoin) can make you pretty anonymous if you want to.
It's also worth mentioning that pretty much all your fiat transactions are logged too under the current system.

The average American probably wouldn't want to.
There's a chance that could change, though. The expectation is that volatility will go down in the long term, which is a reasonable prediction (although not a certainty), and there are a lot of people working to make it easier to use and more accessible to people.
Of course this applies outside the USA as well.

Even if Overstock directly accepted Bitcoin, they would need to sell them (preferably instantly) because they wouldn't be able to pay their suppliers, employees, etc. in Bitcoin. This is practically the same thing, except they outsource the BTC handling part to Coinbase.

Imo, Bitpay is simply worried about potential bad PR. They assume someone's going to write an article that says something to the effect of "bitcoin allows anyone to buy firearms online anonymously" and want to distance themselves from that.

Depends on the lottery. The odds of winning the grand prize on the Powerball is about 1 in 175 million. So the odds of a private key clash would be:

@_date: 2014-03-09 03:53:33
I think you misunderstood me. All I'm saying is that "the network" doesn't give you a reward in the traditional sense of "giving someone money". It creates 25 BTC out of thin air, and lets you spend it in whatever way you wish to (to yourself, to your pool workers, to the Bitcoin eater address, etc.)
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:37:58
Now? Come on...
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:57:18
It's not as simple as 51% of the hashpower controlling everything. Anyone with hashpower and a modded client can start a new chain which keeps giving rewards beyond 21 mil, but it's eventually up to the users to decide which one to join. So even people who don't mine get a say in it.

You're not wrong and that is indeed a concern in general. But I don't think it's a huge problem in this particular scenario given my first bullet point.
Edit: The computational requirements are minimal. The more difficult part is sending the transactions out in such a way that miners receive one first and the merchant receives another.

It works in that it spreads awareness and brings in new users.  But at the same time there are quite a few people that find it off-putting and that reflects negatively on doge (and crypto in general).

It's interesting to apply it to something like Bittorrent Sync to get a Dropbox-like or Amazon S3-like system where you pay in crypto for the bandwidth and disk space you use.

Anyone can increase the limit, but it won't have an effect until the majority of the nodes agree with you.
The reason it's impossible to counterfeit coins is because all transactions are publicly logged. Every node knows how many coins you have and where they came from.
The fees are currently hardcoded into the client, but will become dynamic in the near future. But ultimately, it's up to the miners to decide what transactions they want to include in their blocks. There's nothing stopping them from charging whatever amount they want.
It is accepted globally, but it can't be easily converted to local currency in some countries.

Yes, but afaik the vulnerability in the reference client simply allows you to get DoSed (by not letting your txes confirm).

I've always been bullish on Bitcoin, all the way since $0.28. At this point though, I'm confident enough to hold on to the BTC I have but not enough to invest anything more into it (can't exactly afford to but that's beside the point).

Some valid points, but:
The 7 tps limitation isn't an issue in itself. It's an artificial limit that you can remove any time you want, not an issue that needs fixing.
Also, shortening confirmation times changes nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:09:37
I just don't see how you can claim that it will go up for no other reason than simply the fact that it has done so before.
For the price to rise significantly, a lot of people will have to buy Bitcoin. They would need a good reason to do so and it's performance in 2013 isn't good enough a reason, especially given how it's always compared to tulips and such in the media.
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:50:02
The actual hard fork is not that difficult, though. They can set it up to take effect at a particular block height and announce it well in advance so that by the time the network does fork, most people will have upgraded.
Of course, it's less than ideal and a few people will be on the other fork but the network in general will be fine.

@_date: 2014-03-12 22:07:00
It doesn't have to be, but it's not a huge problem.
Creating and broadcasting a tx would only take a few milliseconds more than a database update. Management of the db is actually less complicated since it doesn't have to track balances and transactions (the blockchain takes care of that). It uses the raw tx API so that every user has just one address, and allows private keys to be exported so that you can access your tipbot balance with a regular wallet. You can also tip straight into someone's account without using the bot.
EDIT: Also, verifiable balances so you know NerdFighterSean won't pull a Karpeles on you.
The only real advantage an offchain bot would have is no tx fees.

Yes, but with Bitcoin, you don't know where the transaction came from. Even if you know the IP (and there's no reliable way of doing so at the moment), nothing prevents someone from creating and signing a tx on one computer and broadcasting it from a node somewhere else.
So IP whitelists wouldn't work. Address whitelists would, but if people want that, why use a p2p decentralized currency in the first place?

I think it's the exact opposite. In the west, people might buy it to speculate but the only people who will actually use it are libertarians (and others who are ideologically against fiat currencies) and people who want anonymity. Anyone outside these groups have little to no reason for adopting bitcoin since the existing system is far more convenient.
In Africa and parts of Asia, though, that system (mostly) doesn't exist. Most people don't use credit cards or even have bank accounts, therefore have a lot more to gain from bitcoin.

I don't have a whole lot of money invested since I realize that Bitcoin may very well fail. And I think you're right in that we could see a whole new crypto that will learn from Bitcoin's mistakes and eventually overtake it. It's not so much blind faith as the fact that I prefer to give Bitcoin the benefit of the doubt. To be honest, I'm far more interested in the technical aspect of cryptocurrency than the economics of it (which isn't really my field at all). I guess my last post came off as a little circlejerk-ish, but that was not the intent.

Which client do you use? Some don't allow you to set fees below a certain amount.
The recommended amount is 0.0001 per KB, and the vast majority of "normal" transactions are under half that amount. The actual amount is set by miners/pool operators - for example Eligius charges 0.00004096 BTC per 512 bytes to include your tx in their blocks.
A free tx should go through eventually since there are ~30 of them allowed per block, so you could try that if you aren't in a hurry to get it confirmed.

No reason... ;)
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:09:45
Half is still half, though. It doesn't matter if you start with 50x10^8 satoshis as a 64-bit integer like we have now or as some arbitrary-precision decimal datatype (like we would have if satoshis could be divided). The rewards would be the same.

Not sure what your question is actually asking. If you can clarify, I'll try to answer the best I can.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:35:18
Isn't Coinbase based there, though?
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:14:00
Why not? Can't you send the money to yourself, setting nLockTime so that it doesn't actually happen for a week?
@_date: 2014-01-19 03:03:11
Yup. Which is one of the reasons why I believe Bitcoin won't (and shouldn't) replace traditional payment systems. And ideally, the only people who would use bitcoin are people who know how to secure them and/or are willing to take the risk.

@_date: 2014-02-04 00:39:59
Yeah, but the opposite is also true. When there's a lot of movement, they say the volatility is going to destroy Bitcoin. When there's none at all, they say the deflation and hoarding is going to destroy it. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 13:36:16
Your average member will understand and follow that rule, but if this thing becomes mainstream, most bitcoin users will not want to hold their own private keys/coins simply because they can't/don't want to secure them properly.

Fork the source, create a new genesis block, premine some coins, spin up a few EC2 instances and see what happens.

Aha. I actually understood that reference.

They let me in and I only had roughly the same amount.

If the receiver has not received coins, then the tx did not confirm and those funds are still with CampBX. It has to be in one of the two wallets, no way around that.
It seems like the problem is that CBX's internal accounting system thinks that the withdrawal was successful, even though the funds never left CBX's wallet. CBX need to either rebroadcast that same tx until it confirms, or manually update your balance with the 5 BTC.
The problem is if they, like Mtgox, only kept the txid as a record of the withdrawal, they might find it difficult to verify on the blockchain that the transfer never actually went through.

@_date: 2015-10-27 16:44:57
Yes and no. The point was making is that 3600 BTC is mined every day, meaning that ~$1 million (or equivalent) of fiat needs to be converted to BTC every day to keep the price at $300.
When the price increases, that figure increases with it.

For the most part, yeah. People will still use it for trading on the deep web, etc. Depending on which countries illegalise it, mining difficulty will probably go down. Development of bitcoin-core would definitely slow down.

Spare change, probably. Although ideally you shouldn't keep any money in wallets that you don't have the private keys to.

Mining dividends aren't going to give you much profit in the long run, considering the rapidly increasing difficulty.
Profit from hardware sales is pretty good atm, though. A lot depends on how the next gen ASICs fare.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:29:10
I can answer a few of your questions.
You're right. BTC wasn't really intended for anonymity and there are ways for a BTC transaction to be anonymous.
As for buying BTC, if you're in the US you can try Coinbase. If not, Bitstamp or one of the other exchanges. Or of course, there's localbitcoins.
A satoshi is 10^-8 BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:09:14
Ah, yes. I've heard this argument before. The line is somewhat self-contradictory. Maybe Obi-wan and I both are secretly Sith.

@_date: 2013-12-14 04:52:03
I'm not 100% certain, but I think how it works is if your business is in China, you're not allowed to accept payments in anything except RMB, regardless of whether it's priced in bitcoins or not.
But people can still pay each other. For example, I do coding work in my free time for bitcoins for a couple of people on bitcointalk. That would still be possible (and afaik legal) if I lived in China.
I also spend some of that BTC I earn on goods and services through gyft and snapcard. That, afaik, would also still be possible and legal in China.
What they can't do is use that BTC to buy stuff from a local business, which by most accounts hasn't been happening a lot before this news anyway. And if they really wanted to, they could sell the coins and buy stuff with fiat (RMB).

As long as the nature of mining (ASIC-resistant) doesn't change, having Litecoin around is beneficial to the cryptocurrency world in general. The same goes for Peercoin, Primecoin (idk how useful the prime number calculation thing actually is, though), Namecoin and all other alts that actually bring something new to the table.

I agree, but imagine it was backed by some goverment or central bank. Enough people would use it to cause bitcoin to lose some significant market share.

Difficulty keeps climbing pretty fast these days, which means the most difficult part of deciding whether or not to invest in mining is the fact that you have no idea whether you will get what you paid for once your hardware arrives.

You can't have 100% anonymity though. There's still a risk, even though a few coins here and there would be near impossible to trace.

Yes. This is also the reason Bitpay (and others) accepts large numbers of zero-conf transactions regularly and don't lose money.

You only need to worry about change when dealing with paper wallets. Anytime you use an actual client application, it will take care of everything for you.
And the app keeps track of all your keys and constantly checks the network(blockchain) to update your current balance.
If I sent you some money, it would show your on your mobile (or PC) app as soon as the transaction reaches you after propagating through the network. This generally only takes a few seconds, except in some rare cases (many outputs/inputs in a transaction with low or no fees).
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:32:14
Possible, yes. Profitable, no.

You accept it at zero confs.
~~Nodes won't relay the second transaction, therefore the attackers have to mine it themselves **before the original gets mined**. How successful they will be depends on how much hashpower they have. This means they need to own some pretty serious hashpower, and therefore have more to gain by helping the network than attacking it.~~

Does not compute.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:24:07
You're 80% there. I'll explain with an example.
Address A receives 0.5 BTC.
You want send 0.3 BTC to from A to B.
You can't spend 0.3 BTC. To spend money you received in a certain transaction, you have to spend the entire amount that you received *from that transaction*.
Therefore, you have to spend 0.5 BTC. Hence, the two outputs - 0.3 to the recipient, 0.2 back to you.
I'm not sure I understand your second question.

That depends on the exact day/month in 2010. In December, the diff hit 12000, which meant he needed to hash at 1200 MHash/s to make 50 BTC a day. A high-end desktop CPU of the time would have produced about 33 MHash/s.
@_date: 2013-05-13 06:04:46
No. He created a new address, sent coins to it, then imported a backup from before the new address was created. This backup did not contain the private key to his new address, so now the coins are lost.

The fluctuations in price aren't an inherent attribute of bitcoin.
It's a result of the fact that a very high percentage of people who decide to buy bitcoin do it for purely speculative reasons, without understanding what they're actually investing in. Those people are the cause of the steep runups and crashes.
Those of us who actually believe in bitcoin don't really care about price movements in either direction. What we do care about is the fact that bitcoin is being used as a currency and payment system more and more every day.
We do have stable growth. The exchange rate doesn't have a lot to do with that at the moment, though.

The standard fee for most transactions is 0.0001 BTC , which is less than 10 cents *if you really want it to be on the next block*.
You can also send free transactions and they will eventually be confirmed as long as they are not very large (in terms of the amount of data, not coins). The current version of Bitcoin allows a *minimum* of 27 free transactions per block.
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:15:45
It means that your transaction was not relayed for some reason. Try to spend it again, and make sure you're paying enough fees.

The safest way to move money from the paper wallet to the online/mobile wallet is to create and sign a transaction offline using Electrum or the brainwallet.org script. **Remember to send change back to yourself.** Then transfer that signed transaction to a online computer or mobile device and broadcast it.
And you can track the balance of your paper wallet by looking up its address on blockchain.info, blockexplorer.com or a similar site.

The brainwallet guy lost the money because the tool he used to create his wallet had a backdoor in it. To prevent that from happening, use one of the open source tools whose code has been reviewed multiple times. (bitaddress.org, brainwallet.org). For super-paranoid-level security, download the Html/JS and run them on an offline computer booted from a linux live CD.
It's not a good idea to store a large amount of bitcoin on your phone or an online wallet. Keep as much BTC on those wallets as the amount of cash you would normally have with in your physical wallet.
I'm not a big fan of Blockchain.info's mobile app, but their browser-based wallet is great. As far as local clients go, I would recommend Electrum.
But if you plan on buying a large amount of coins, I would suggest setting up a paper wallet with backups or an offline Electrum wallet.

Yes, paper wallets provide the best security **when handled correctly**. A paper wallet is simply your private key printed on paper. The public key can be derived from that mathematically. Using a paper wallet would require you to create transactions manually and also not forget to send the change back to yourself. 
And the QR codes people have are their addresses, which is basically a hash of the public key.

@_date: 2013-12-21 23:09:44
Or any amount to any address. As far as the network is concerned, the previous transaction never happened. That money is still in your wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:50:50
It's 1000 bytes now.

Maybe strict foreign exchange controls. Pretty common in Asia.

It means that you need to register if you mine for other people (i.e sell mining contracts)

How small? Where do you live?

The software isn't as anti-intuitive as you claim.
The problem here is that OP used a tool to create a raw transaction (very low-level and meant to be used by experts and developers) instead of using an actual bitcoin client. He had no idea how raw txs work, so he spent all his change as fees.

No problem. Always happy to help out and give back to the community.
The blockchain ( is the public ledger - a record of all bitcoin transcations made since the Genesis block and it's about 16GB in size. Bitcoin-Qt needs this in order to work. Electrum uses a copy hosted on a trusted public server.
As for online wallets, I know Coinbase has been having issues with transaction not being broadcasted. I would recommend Blockchain.info's wallet **with 2 Factor Auth**. Also, Mycelium if you want an app for your Android device.

Did a message about the tx fee show up and did you click the "Adjust amount" button on it?
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:28:18
How did not get any upvotes?

Sad, but true. And it's unlikely that it will be back to that point by Jan 15.

* Download the bitaddress.org page
* generate an encrypted paper wallet using an offline computer
* print it
* go back to your regular computer
* transfer the coins to the paper wallet
* store in a secure place
* wait 5 years
* ???
* (hopefully) profit

Ah, but which government?

Congrats OP.

Wow. Loaded is loaded.

The difference is that the the creator holds a large amount of coins which were mined either before release or just after, and can then cash out at the expense of everyone else.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:56:25
got it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:28:33
Not sure why she's so focused on the fact that it's difficult to acquire bitcoins *anonymously*. She even tweeted that it was difficult for to get the currency, which he said it wasn't.

To be fair, most American news stations shit all over themselves.

It's almost certainly very old coins, and very interesting.
If someone has a copy of the blockchain, set up Abe and you can identify which block this happened in.

I don't think you understand what's going on here.

If he absorbs 3.5527*10^47 joules every time he sees the aforementioned posts, cracking SHA-256 would be the least of your worries.

It's not that short.

Exactly. They waited until the technology behind those products evolved up to the point where they could work their magic and adapt those it to the mass market.
Bitcoin, with all the growing pains it's experiencing at the moment, is simply not there *yet*.

If you want any help with the web dev side of things (integrating bitcoin payment APIs and such), add me on Jabber - Ditto

Fair point.

It will confirm. Could take a few hours (or days) though.

Wishful thinking?

@_date: 2013-12-27 01:14:06
You make a valid point there. I think that it's because most of the popular services were built back when Bitcoin was a lot less mainstream. Most people in the community back then were more tech-savvy than your average consumer. This also had the effect where users of these services are required to be (at least mostly) responsible for the security of their data (i.e private keys, wallet seeds and such).
They're still not in a position that meets the needs of the average consumer, but with all the money that's being invested in companies like Coinbase, Circle and Bitpay, it seems that 2014 will see a large improvement in these services.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:25:59
They do. It's kind of their job to do so.

2^192 times 256 bits = 1.606938x10^60
The largest hard drives currently store 4 TB, so about 182687704666362864775460604089535377456991567872 of them would be needed.
Of course, that's only for the hashes, not the complete table.

This is correct, but in satellite view you should see a scale model of Europe.
