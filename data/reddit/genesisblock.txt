I didn't find anybody that makes them. If you make static cling vinyl "bitcoin Accepted Here" stickers, I'll buy a few! :)

I had the same problem. After completing the payment via BitPay, try going to:  
  
Then click the "DOWNLOAD MP3" button (you won't see the "DOWNLOAD MP3" button until you've paid via BitPay).

I'd love a "bitcoin Accepted Here" window sticker that has skull88's golden bitcoin logo instead of the orange logo.
This is skull88's golden bitcoin logo that I want:
The full sized png file for the golden bitcoin is linked in skull88's original thread:
I want the sticker to be static cling vinyl so that I can put it on the back window of my car and easily peel it off later.
Bitcoin Stickers makes a "bitcoin Accepted Here" window sticker and a separate "golden bitcoin" sticker, but I want them combined:

BitPay lets you set your prices in over 150 different currencies. Merchants in some countries can choose to receive a direct deposit into their bank account. Payments to bank accounts are made per business day in local currencies.

Matt Miller is doing a great job. Of course, he should have [bought Heineken with bitcoin]( :)
