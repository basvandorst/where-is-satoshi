Must be something wrong with me, but I’m much more interested in the left hand side of the photo

I use Coinigy and it seems to work pretty well for me. One thing I did notice though, is that if you’re placing a buy order, put your purchase quantity slightly lower to make allowances for the trading fee that is not always correctly identified just below it. Therefore if I’m buying ADA (not a shill ;)) I would put in 99 coins rather 100 to allow for a variance in fees - though of course you’d expect it to always be the same. Hope that helps

Yes API trading mostly via Bittrex and GDAX and it works fine for me. I suppose you’ve double checked that the trading tick box is activated on the API tab..?  Although it was quite a simple process, it did take me a couple of goes before it setup correctly. I hope they get back to you soon

Same thought and I came across an app called “Crumbs” on the UK appstore. No reviews so not sure how good it is but looks to do what you’re after. Otherwise also found “Skraps.io” - web based, but you add a bank card and any transactions up to a certain amount are allocated according to your choosing..
Hope that helps

I think what this guy is trying to show is that it is typical for Bitcoin/crypto and volatile assets to behave this way, and therefore people shouldn’t assume that a 90%+ loss in asset value is the end. A bit of patience and continuing to advocate for this technology will do wonders in the long run. Just my two pence
