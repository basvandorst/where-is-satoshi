Another way to think about this decision is how much of your money can you afford to lose? As this upcoming fork may cause some uncertainty, any funds you invest pre-fork should be funds you are willing to part with. The rest (if you are on the conservative/fearful spectrum) you can decide what to do with after you have the information presented post-fork.

If you are invested in BTC during the forks, depending how your are holding the BTC, you should be receiving 1btc:b2x. Now what happens to these holdings is up to market and community. If you believe in either option through your own dd then you should either see a confirmation of your hypothesis or not.  
Whatever portion you choose to not put into btc is still subject to the overwhelming market psychology that will have taken over the whole of investors of this tech. 
To sum, no one knows the outcome. Their may be probabilities but not definitive answer. The best advice I could give is invest in the best tech that marries with your beliefs

This action of selling your b2x for btc is a vote in the direction of btc. Whether this will be the predominant chain no one knows. This is your gamble. You take advantage of the other persons belief that b2x will be the dominant winner. Now whether there will be anyone available to trade with is the question.

Another reason for value being attributed to btc is due to mining. How do you think new bitcoins are created? Just printed up by a federal reserve of btc core? No. Miners have to spend resources to get this reward. These funds could be spent elsewhere, opportunity cost, which in turn gives it an intrinsic value. Demand for the coins continues to increase that value.

0.67 is such an arbitrary number? Any specific reason for that amount? (Sorry just snooping)
Anyway to answer your question it's definitely possible but possible for you is another question. I'm sure you've heard the advice of using a calculator and such and so not going to mention the obvious but electricity cost is the biggest factor towards profitability.
I've been mining less than 2 months on one rig and can say that currently, for me, it is profitable and possible to get to your arbitrary 0.67 in less than half a year.

I would disagree. The PS4 is money you've already spent and I'm guessing you're not using it as much now as when you bought it. I would say sell it NOW and buy some btc. And if not btc then some thing else such as bcc, ltc, etc. Trust me. You will thank me in a few years time

The miners who find the coins are also paying for huge sums of electricity. These funds could be used for an infinity of other investments but they choose to mine the cryptos. The opportunity cost given up by the miners definitely has a value that can be attached to the mined coin.

What a great resource. Thx

In relation to a strategy for the upcoming form. What do you think about exchanging your BTC to BCH until after the fork and seeing how things play out and then get back in? Any others with strategies on minimizing losses on the fork?
