Like any theft market, there is always the opportunity for bounty hunters, I suppose. :)

That would certainly bring more attention to Bitcoins - a show where people track down Bitcoin thieves!

You are definitely right if there isn't any other form of transaction ID than the address.

runeks - thanks for the link!
That thread has some great feedback.
Maybe instead of thinking about protecting merchants from blacklisted wallets, which is obviously not well accepted, the idea of protecting consumers from merchants by providing a rating system for the merchants by wallet would be more acceptable? (my  item)
This could be done at a merchant list site, of course, such as   Should it be done at the wallet level instead?

Ah, good to know.  I thought that most merchants would use a single address where payments would be made.  We are looking into accepting BTC for our service and were planning to use a single online wallet for payments and a mostly-offline wallet as a proxy to USD.  Is there an advantage to having every user pay to a separate address?
Agreed on the rating system and other sites are probably sufficient.  I just thought it might be a good idea to have a warning system at the payment level.  If a single address was used for a merchant, this would work.  If a merchant switched addresses, they would be back to a low rating (no ratings).  Maybe this would cause other unforeseen problems?  For example, maybe it's actually a good idea to easily change addresses for merchants?
