i think this is all some crazy fad/bubble and it will blow over within 6 months. there is no real value to bitcoin except as currency.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:35:25
I don't think theres anyone willing to loan money for bitcoin right now, so no.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:52:06
it keeps its value independent of the government's decisions, i don't really know.
still doesn't explain why it suddenly exploded from $100 to $1000 in a few months.

its fighting back up. give it another 2 hours
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:29:06
your friend is wrong about many things. it will likely be used more in the future as an anonymous easy to use currency on the internet.
i really doubt it will be forgotten in 5 years unless some newer more anonymous thing comes out.
either way, the shit we're seeing now is a bubble.

is their goal to allow bitcoin apps and transactions on the app store? no. 
Why is it a mistake for them to allow, support, or endorse bitcoin and bitcoin related apps?
To you, it is a mistake. To them, the denial of bitcoin serves other means that are likely far more beneficial for them.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:27:00
i disagree. the only thing you can easily buy with bitcoin right now is drugs. 
That has been the case for quite some time.
the way i look at it, nothing has happened in terms of spending bitcoin in the past few days. there is no new value/demand to it.
 the only reason people are into it is because they want to make money and because the senate and bernanke said its cool.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:44:04
that it is "worth" so much
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:48:51
find someone dumb enough to lend you money for it......... or to give you some good or service in exchange for it.

and you still haven't explained anything, mr. bitcoin know-it-all

never said it was normal, just said it was 800
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:16:16
given that the growth in the last month was around 400%, i would expect it to be higher, yes.
the point is that the growth should have come from more businesses accepting it, not the media hype that resulted from its bubble growth causing businesses to accept it.

its not perfectly anonymous but to my understanding it is difficult to trace, and it allows for quick and easy digital transactions.
decentralized money? not dependent on a government for value, i suppose.
to me, it still doesn't explain the sudden increase in value.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:14:12
this is a bubble caused by hype. The thing is that there is no easy way to spend it right now. if you don't have bitcoin right now, i strongly urge you to stay out right now.
supply and demand is key here. so yes, as more are mined, they become harder to mine and also decrease in value.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:42:30
try telling that to all the fools who bought it to make a quick buck.
when it makes more sense to hold on to the currency based on its fluctuating value and predicted increase in value, i think you'll agree, its no longer a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:31:17
don't even bother with $50...
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:02:05
i mean just because it doesn't need a bank or government and is immune to legislation doesn't make it inherently valuable imo. isn't the value of a currency derived from what it can be exchanged for? from what I can see its still difficult to acquire bitcoin and then exchange it for items such as food and clothing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:24:09
everyone is a speculator right now. there have been no new developments in spending bitcoin aside from baidu and the ATM in vancouver. 
The only thing you can really spend it on is shit from silk road 2.0
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:04:25
there are special bitcoin mining devices. they are known as ASICs. they perform a specialized task very quickly. not really a high-end supercomputer, but rather a very specific computer. still not cheap though. they do have some "upper hand" but it is getting progressively more difficult to mine bitcoin, diminishing the profit while equipment and power still cost the same.

no, you can get an android on it. I did it and it works. if you are signing a new contract with new phones, tell the idiots NOT to mess with your plan AT ALL.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:28:46
satoshi could do it, and i wonder if he could just setup a few wallets and just move the money around and not actually use/lose any
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:02:53
i agree with burritos. it is hype now, but it will likely be the next big thing as it becomes easier to buy and sell and use.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:53:07
and in this scenario it is subjective
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:55:41
you will be downvoted, but i completely agree with you. the only real thing bitcoin can be currently used for is drugs and other illegal services.  how many people who have bitcoin intend to use it for that? the value is not coming from anything tangible, it's all hype. it's a bubble, that much is certain.
edit: i will also be downvoted as well. but who cares? 
its not like karma is some worthless virtual currency whose value has been greatly inflated by speculators right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:25:42
i agree completely. i have taken an interest because of the insane volatility that is happening right now
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:34:36
what a strange response. if you obviously know better than me, then why has bitcoin grown so much? 
i don't believe it is because people are buying goods and actually using it as a currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:28:31
its not exact, but i think many people are currently exchanging bitcoin for money to many others who wish to do the same, not to buy actual products. 
i think that the majority of bitcoin holders who have become bitcoin holders in the past year have not done so to purchase products but in hopes of making money by selling the bitcoin to others. and those people that buy them also do not hope to buy products, and hope to sell to others. 
and that is how we get to $1100 in like a month.
i don't know how you would measure this, but it would help greatly to see how much bitcoin is actually being spent on goods, not simply exchanged for money.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:07:55
that is starting, yes, but the amount of growth we have seen vs the amount of businesses that are actually accepting bitcoin, and the products available in exchange from bitcoin do not reflect the growth.
my point is that the growth should have come from more businesses accepting bitcoin, not the other way around. that is how currencies become VALUABLE, they allow for easy exchange of goods.
what has happened so far is that bitcoin has become so hyped that businesses are coming around to accepting it now.
but once again, due to its volatility, why would you buy stuff with bitcoin? why would you buy something worth $20 in bitcoin today, when that same amount of btc could be worth $50-$100 tomorrow or the day after?
why would you invest in currency that is so volatile? when your money today could get you $100 btc, or $200 btc tomorrow?
my point is that currently it is not behaving as a currency, but more as some sort of investment vehicle to exchange to others who are indeed, "greater fools".
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:15:32
not only when people panic sell, but also when people stop buying it because its overvalued...
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:08:04
idk but roommate says it will keep going up and settle around ~~$3000~~ make that $5000
he says he is a credible source because he is a jew.

i agree with HRvi. aside from that, this is a bubble.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:41:05
it is anonymous and decentralized. that still doesn't explain it's rapid growth. i didn't hear of a huge influx of people suddenly demanding anonymous transactions.
