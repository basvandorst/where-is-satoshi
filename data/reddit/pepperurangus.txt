OP can you give us an update on how many people have tried to scam you in the past 10 hours? 
I asked for help once and had 3 different people try to get me to install malware via private messages..

Yeah, but on the other hand British banking allows instant transfers between any bank account, at any bank, for free.. 
And has done since long before Bitcoin existed. 
So it's a bit disheartening to see Bitcoin not even managing to beat existing fintec. Not even after, what, 7 years?

I would say that 'just' should be removed from that sentence. 


Not fast, not cheap... And why does that last bit even matter?

Lol at you all complaining about an utterly inconsequential pm, yet when I asked for help this morning someone instantly attempted to steal my coins via pm.
This is what you should be annoyed about. And yes, I've reported him.

Glad it's confirmed, but that was a pretty ridiculous amount of time I had to wait. Especially given how much I paid. When I make a bank transfer with my bank it's free and arrives in the other account in seconds!

Not mine! All the 'receive' addresses in Electrum say 3 at the beginning. It's showing as unconfirmed in my wallet, so something has worked.

Updated to latest version of Electrum and it confirmed. Must have just been that my old version wasn't compatible or something? 
Also, pretty sure someone tried to scam me out of my coins in my PM's. He sent me a link to here (WARNING DONT DOWNLOAD):
and told me to upgrade.. 
At least he kind of helped by reminding me to download the latest version, lmao. Thank you, Mr Scammer.

Yes, I've set up multisig. I've never had trouble sending to these addresses in the past. 
Nevermind. Updated to latest client and just got 1 confirmation. Might have been a version problem.

I've been away from this sub for so long. 
When did the sensible set in? This is an amazing transformation.

So confident that you needed to post about it on an forum dedicated to the asset you just bought? Mhmm.
