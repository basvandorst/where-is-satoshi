That sounds nice but I don't think it's possible. As far as I understand it, the private key is mathematically tied to the public key uniquely. I doubt there's a way to make multiple private keys with different properties. All the verification has to happen on a higher level in the software. Right now, that means nodes checking that outputs don't exceed inputs, etc. In a subscription scheme the time limits and whatnot would be part of that verification, but you can't implement those restrictions into the private key. 
Think about it this way: in the scheme you described, the key I give to the merchant would be invalid for withdrawal at some time t and become valid at t+1. Since the key itself didn't change, the only way it could become valid is if the network considers a transaction from it valid at that time based on the parameters of the agreement. So that's why I think that verification has to happen on the network level rather than being built-in to the key. That being said, we're trusting in the network's verification mechanisms anyway by using bitcoin so it's not really an issue.

Unfortunately you have to buy them separately, and they're like $20 which is insane. It was worth it to me though.

I guess we interpreted his comment differently. I saw it as implying that artists would rush to bitcoin as soon as tipping became common, so I was just trying to point out that we need to be patient. Something this community isn't exactly known for.

Actually the qr code of the private key is covered, but the actual private key is right there next to the keychain. It would be legible if the photo was a higher resolution.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:29:11
No even passwords that seem secure are often discovered by bots relatively quickly because people have bots checking tons of possible phrases all the time. This is why it's usually a bad idea to use a brainwallet unless your password is very long and very random.
@_date: 2014-06-28 04:13:56
In theory, sure. But in reality most of them don't know what Bitcoin is or have heard of it but don't understand it very well. You spend too much on forums like these and you start to think everyone is as enthusiastic about it as people here are, but we're not there yet.

@_date: 2014-07-10 19:37:22
While I'm not sure this is technically impossible, it makes more sense to me as a feature built on top of bitcoin rather than being part of the payment protocol. The scheme you're describing would require the user to give the merchant their private key for that special address so they could pull payments from it, which is a messy way to do it. One of bitcoin's main strengths over credit cards is that it's a "push" rather than a "pull" payment system, and I think you'd make a lot of people angry if you tried to change that paradigm.

It just seems like this community idolizes him so much. Don't get me wrong. He's great. I love his talks and what he's doing for Bitcoin. But this feels like we're lifting him to kind of a "larger than life" figure, which is unhealthy in my opinion. I think that's what meant.

I think I understand what you're saying but brainwallets aren't a new technology in the bitcoin world. They've been around a while. The issue isn't a lack of paranoia; mainstream money technologies are insured and easy to use. Bitcoin's infrastructure just isn't there yet.

@_date: 2014-06-27 02:50:02
No it's not that simple. A lot of people, informed people with good reputations, have recommended brainwallet.org. This is similar to this community's reaction to the mtgox fiasco, where they called people stupid for using it. The reality is that until you can safely use bitcoin without having a degree in computer security, it's not going to go mainstream. Simple as that.

@_date: 2012-08-02 05:49:26
Thanks for the account. My main feedback is that I think your wallet balance should be in the top bar there, near the name. It's also a little confusing to have the Coinbase at the top-left be the wallet, and to have the home-page on its own tab. Maybe clicking Coinbase should lead to the "Home" page and there should be a separate tab for "Wallet". Or you could only see that page if you're not signed in (I think that would make sense). Anyway good job on the site; lots of good stuff.
@_date: 2012-08-08 15:15:37
It wouldn't be too hard just to be careful. You could fold it so they can only see the public key.

Anybody else think the bitcoin price is like a seismograph?
@_date: 2012-08-04 03:15:53
I agree that banks would spring up but I disagree that we would end up where we are now because bitcoin makes fractional reserve banking. If I'm a bank with 10,000 BTC I cannot loan out anymore than 10,000 BTC. It's just not possible. And I don't think (hope) people would accept a fiat currency as "Bitcoin IOU's" so the system would not be able to regress to the debt machine that we have now.
@_date: 2012-08-09 23:54:29
like at the same time?
@_date: 2012-07-18 13:55:51
Yeah they're all on a new wallet with blockchain. I know the password and have it in my LastPass just in case. I also have a paper backup, and it's backed up on my Google Drive. It was stolen at UCLA on July 9th. I left it on a bench and someone took it. Then I saw on Find my iPhone how far away it was so it was stolen. But it had a password on it so they wouldn't have been able to access the coins even if they knew how.
@_date: 2012-08-26 04:49:45
correct. controlled by the government but owned by private banks. We're on the same page I think.

good point, but why would it matter to have, say MtGox, on TOR since the funding method would not be anonymous.

It's the decision of the seller. They can choose to tie their price to USD and have the BTC price fluctuate accordingly to MtGox, or they can set a static BTC price.

Yeah I was thinking about going to businesses and asking them to accept bitcoin, but I think the only way they could be persuaded is if it's a no-risk issue for them and they could only gain money from it. I understand having Bit-Pay set up would cost the business, correct?

I think when looking at the future of bitcoin value, it could be useful to also look at the future stability of the USD. As it is probably the currency most closely tied to the bitcoin, a loss of buying power of it could only help bitcoin. But of course it depends who you ask about the future of the USD.
