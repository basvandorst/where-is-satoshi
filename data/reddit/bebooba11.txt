Nice dude. This may be the oddest "thing" I have ever done. Solving math problems for digital money...

your negativity is bleeding though my keyboard....

I had a full encrypted and password protected bitcoin wallet with recent encrypted backups. I restored the most recent backup only for the sync with the network to still reflect the stolen BTC's as I expected would happen :( I didn't back it up anywhere but my local drives and a SAN at my house.

It's still incredibly sad to see that sent transaction in my transaction log...currently dumped the rest of my BTC to my mobile wallet. I seem to get the angriest when I think back on the 2 months of happiness I had in mining only for it to be destroyed. Currently searching my PC for anything that might have caused this. I dont think my PC is infected at all.
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:53:16
It just sucks that there is no way to reverse or invalidate the transaction. Miners are confirming stolen BTC's. Glad I didn't lose my ass on this like others did. I'll stick to my day job ;)

I really need to stop looking at the block chain info. My 1.36 BTC are just sitting in this assholes wallet still. Grrrr...
I wont even care about it anymore if I can sell these stupid miners.
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:11:15
Thanks! I'll have a look.

MultiBit wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:19:35
Thanks! I'll check it out!
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:23:24
Why do you recommend that? Does being in Slushes pool have and disadvantage compared to BTC Guild of GHash.IO?
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:19:10
I'm hoping for about 0.1686 BTC per day. I also hope to at least make my money back...famous last words. I'm going in 1/3's with 2 friends. I love the idea of Bitcoin, how it works, where these magical blocks covered in math problems filled with bitcoins come from, the idea that it's decentralized and...well, it doesn't hurt to make a buck while supporting bitcoin and donating to the good people of this great movement.

Its gotta be but I gotta dig on my PC because I don't see anything odd. Plus how would they know my wallet password?

Dskloet has crushed my dreams. Not only that butterfly labs would take months to ship, it seems to be an issue pre-ordering from anywhere. Not sure my strategy now...it's consuming my life.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:45:32
Is there any information that could be obtained from the transaction details from MultiBit?
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:08:10
I'm reading one forum post about how you pre-order it and takes 6 months to get. By then the complexity level grows and the card is useless. Or that its a scam for the most part. I mean, they were at the CES and it got rather good reviews. That might mean its better to buy a unit that someone has in hand instead of the pre-order.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:04:42
I guess that was my thought too. As a new miner, the idea of paying off my investment is top of the list. I do care about survival of bitcoin. I do enjoy Slushes pool for sure. I just wonder if I would potentially mine a little more with a larger pool.

Trans ID is: 9cfa54d0a5537e18e4e89a64da1c5c85981cd90b5a5aeeec002bca4fffbe7f8a
You can see multiple outputs from my wallet (18dgM21hd7utCX1d6WTpVmcuMa95ezi7cU) going to this persons wallet: (1QCqvw923Tv8zSgnZRSQfaP1PNFKF8VjJs....)

I guess thats similar to Regus in US

Right, well, the website i'm using (mining.bitcoin.cz) has a little account template where I plug in my wallet address. It also has a "send threshold" which I have set to .01. Since i have .00000XXXX bitcoins, i'm assuming I have to reach a .01 and it will send it to my wallet!? Thanks for the help.

@_date: 2014-06-09 12:43:54
FYI, I don't have that wallet ID anymore. I had to delete everything linked to the old wallet and start from scratch. Let me know what you find, I'm intrigued!

I do not have free electricity. I have mining fever and just think the idea is cool. I'm really watching my electricity on TV's/cable/leaving lights on and stuff. I have a full time job and don't mind spending money to make some! I'll eventually figure out a solar way to keep mining off the grid!! I AM Tony Stark...
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:07:15
BTW, 3 weeks into my mining adventure, I really appreciate you harshing on my BFL dreams. That place is a night mare and I am so glad I didn't pre-order. My Horrors of BFL post is sticky'd in @_date: 2014-01-22 23:32:45
You sound like a disgruntled coworker from Butterflylabs
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:06:08
Thanks for the replies!
My setup is the following. Mining Slushes pool for 2 months. I have MultiBit Wallet installed locally on my computer instead of a hosted wallet.
I've been mining for 2 months as stated and built up to 1.36 BTC. I logged into my wallet yesterday to see that i was at .03 BTC with a sent transaction to this wallet. I wept, then drank some gin but my BTC is still gone.
Moral of the story? Transfer BTC's every day between wallets..lol
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:04:38
A friend asked if we could find the guy. I explained to him that we cant find them and beat them up.
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:08:17
It wasn't on the PC i was mining from. I have a netbook for all of that configured with my miners but I understand your point. I wish there was a way to prove that I didn't actually send the BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:51:31
IP Address from Atlanta. 1.364 BTC ganked and never getting it back. Guess i'm not very good at being my own bank.
If something is on my PC, its deep, deep in there because I just re-imaged the other day.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:44:47
Is it safe to say that i'll never get it back...?
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:30:22
Does Unspent on the block chain about a transaction just mean that the BTC's wern't "spent" from the wallet that my BTC was sent to? I'm interested in at least watching the block chain.
