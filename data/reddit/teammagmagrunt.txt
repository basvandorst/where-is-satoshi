Thank you!

But if the transaction fees remain low, wouldn't incentive decline? Is that why some want the fees to climb?

Ah, thank you for pointing that out! Totally my mistake - I forgot to account for blockchain confirmation.

Thank you for pointing that out!

This is perhaps a stupid question. But once the supply of 21 million bitcoins have been completely depleted and distributed into the market, will there be any motive to mining? Is it just to confirm the validity of each blockchain?

Thank you! Unfortunately, since I don't have access to my work email until Monday when I return to the office, could you possibly send me a PM here?
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:28:39
Ah, gotcha. Thank you for the input!

I'm the author of the article! Glad to see it being shared on Reddit.

Author here. 
I had originally included it in the Q&amp;A infobox at the end of the article, but it was removed without my knowledge before it went to print. I'm a bit mad about it because, like you said, it implies that the Bitcoin is as low as it goes.

Hey all, author of the atricle here. 
This story was originally posted for the Detroit Free Press and, apparently, got posted to USA Today, much to my surprise. So, glad to see it getting national coverage!

Unrelated, but your username is super familiar and I can't remember why.

Not gonna lie, I was really tripped up on my phrasing during that particular sentence and had a bunch of trouble coming up with a substitute. So I understand and agree your argument completely. Thanks for the clarification.

While I do agree that Bitcoin is having a drastic impact both on the economy and on our daily lives like you mentioned, the specific angle of the article was focused on its background as a decentralized, fluctuating currency. I'm not saying that you're wrong when you say I omitted those things. However, had I included them, the article would've been another typical "What is Bitcoin?" piece that any middle schooler could write. Simply describing the bitcoin would've been boring. Going in-depth on its legality, value, and place in economics among the U.S. dollar wasn't something I had seen done often, so I went with that angle.
