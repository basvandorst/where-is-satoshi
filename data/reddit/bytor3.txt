Not sure how long you've been following, but seeing at least 5+ reps speak semi-articulately about cryptocurrencies has actually boosted my faith in Congress immensely. They were so much worse in the past.

If you set a minimum time I think you can expect that to become the average block time as more transactions necessitate more throughout. My question to you is what benefit would you expect?

Cash? I have a feeling this post has very little to so with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:17:22
No, that wouldn't make much sense. If you did that, spam transactions could make the blocks get faster and faster until propagation time became an issue.
Edit: The genius of the fixed time, fixed size blocks is that the market determines transaction fees therefore discouraging waste. Thus, blocks remain somewhat predictable at least on average.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:55:34
Spam and probably a scam

This is a prettt low risk incident as it would be extremely difficult for the perp to actually make off with your funds.

OK I can't tell if you haven't thought this through or just don't feel like explaining. But if you're giving your identity to the exchange, that's called KYC. If this is some kind of single-use document that shows you've supplied further information to a 3rd party, I see no benefit.

What the hell is the message here? People do use apps to estimate where their finances will be in 40 years. It's called retirement planning. Nothing to do with bitcoin aside from owning some bitcoin is a good hedge against tail risk, i.e. the estimation is wildly wrong.

Yes I think your logic is correct. But let's try out a few numbers. 
If BTC supply is ~17 mil and mining rewards total ~660,000 BTC annual, that's a stock-to-flow of ~25.7.
Now let's say 2 million are revealed to be lost instantly, that gives us a stock-to-flow of ~22.7.
Now next year block rewards get cut in half, doubling the stock-to-flow in both cases, to 51.4 and 45.4, respectively.
In another 4 years or so this will happen again. Once the stock-to-flow is high enough, the actual value doesn't matter, as it's essentially infinite. Gold's is near 50 and we already consider it a basically fixed supply. USD must be in the teens or less.

Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopolous. It will take a while and you'll have to stop and look things up if you're new, but that book is absolutely the authority on bitcoin. You can skip the super technical parts but without understanding the protocol you'll get nowhere.

Baller, but walking around with or even owning a scratch-off copy of your private keys is super dangerous for high amounts. Better to use 24-word seed with passphrase and never write them down together.

Visa and MasterCard are just payment processors. They don't care if people waste or steal the bank's money. The banks are the ones who have to pay all these bills.

Laws need clarified that total bitcoin sales under $10k per year are tax free and don't require filing.

Your statement is technically true but your point is irrelevant. Cash doesn't have to move into bitcoin directly, but that value does have to be transferred. It's not like bitcoin can just add $7T to the world's total value.
To reach $7T mcap, there has to be $6.9T of value invested in bitcoin and then someone has to still have enough cash to bid higher than the current price. That does require some capital.

Ok I have to step in here because the title seems to conflate a few things. 
Samsung's primary business model for logic is now foundry, which means they produce whatever their customers design and order. Customer here means chip design company like NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Bitmain, etc. Samsung's only competition for sub-14nm foundry is TSMC, who produces all Bitmain chips.
Samsung does produce bitcoin ASICs and has for a while, including but not limited to chips for Halong Mining. The ASICs are manufactured using the same processes as GPUs and other logic, so there is no consious decision to "pivot". It's simply based on customer order.
