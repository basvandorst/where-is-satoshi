Why artificially engineer a network to give priority to those who pay the highest fee?

Depends how you view Bitcoin, I guess. Is it a digital currency akin to fiat currency or is it a business designed for maximizing profit? The US Treasury doesn’t charge different customers different fees, but profit making banks will (based on risk). What role should bitcoin play? Both?

I still like theme parks. If the line was a week long, I would probably lose faith, though.  Especially if the rich kids could pay for an express line and run through in 20 minutes.  That would not be a theme park I would like.

Any idea when Lightning will be available?

How do I do it right? I never changed any setting in my wallet to move to a different transaction speed.

I would.

I agree with that as long they don’t decide to cash out.

There is truth to this. If the US, for example, hits a recession in the next few years, the government has very few levers to do much to help us out of it. Monetary policy? Rates are already near the floor, lowering won’t stimulate much. Fiscal policy?  We have historically massive debt, government has no room to fund stimulus. Our economy’s health tends to influence other economies’ health. Will be very interesting (stressful?) to see what happens after this bull run ends.

I think the incentive structure is the only flaw in the Satoshi white paper and that’s simply because it creates an additional tax for using bitcoin.  It doesn’t seem to consider the bigger picture of how this impacts the user relative to other potential payment options. The only way this evens out is if the user (transactor) has an opportunity to earn some return for his/her transaction (ie - pay for some activity associated with that transaction from another blockchain platform).

This was the response I feared.  How is that a system better than physical cash?  Cash is free to transact and private.  I realize Bitcoin was designed to improve on digital cash and eliminate the need for trusted third parties to verify transactions and reduce double spend, which works well for institutions looking to reduce their costs, but not for day-to-day consumers.  It becomes a (likely) large double-tax on regular transactions once they lose the mining incentive.

Helpful clarification. Thanks
