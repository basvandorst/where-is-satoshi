Capital gains is only 15% if you held the investment for more than a year. Otherwise, I believe it's closer to 35%.

I'm working on a block explorer and came across examples of single outputs to multiple addresses, which had me a little confused at first since it seems like there's double the UTXO (coins) available. This answer I found on [SO]( also implies that the 'addresses' array is for multi-signature transactions, which makes sense.
However, it seems there's a security issue with that answer and there's likely more to it. For example, if the number of required signatures can be just 1, this means I could send coins to someone else and include my address in the output so both the receiver and I are able to spend those coins. I'm not aware of any wallets that indicate this so the receiver may not know unless they check the actual transaction details looking for it. If they send me my goods and don't spend the output transaction... I could just send the coins to another address and the initial receiver would lose them.
Unfortunately, I can't seem to find more info about this either. Hopefully, someone else chimes in with more knowledge.

I mine and hold everything. However, I think you're right about big miners having a huge influence on price and spot on about them selling regularly to cover costs. In my trading analysis, I use difficulty or the cost to mine a single coin as the main input into my prediction model for market bottoms.
As I've seen, the price rarely gets below the cost to mine. Miners appear to be smart enough to not sell during the dips.

When I hear "paper wallet", I think encrypted file on multiple, redundant, encrypted USB drives stored securely in multiple locations.
If you think "paper wallet" is referring to actual printed paper, you should just go back to 1990.
