Good point, thanks

Alright, thanks for the advice. My school has an accounting program, maybe I'll try and make friends with one of the students or something

I'm going to pick up a copy of turbo tax later, thanks. This is mainly what I was looking for, how exactly to go about doing it, since I have no experience whatsoever paying taxes yet. 
If I don't owe any taxes (looks like if you make less than 36,000 a year you don't pay capital gains), should I still fill out the 1040 and send it in to the IRS?

Are accountants like lawyers? Is their some sort of confidentiality agreement that they won't rat you out to the police? Could I find an accountant that I could straight up ask the best way of staying off the IRS radar in my given circumstances? I'm not really worried about how much it would cost

The main reason I want to pay the taxes is because I don't want the IRS to start an investigation into where the money came from if they see me depositing large amounts into my bank account, I would rather show them I have nothing to hide and just show them that I mined all my BTC in 7th grade when they were worth about a dollar.

I would way rather pay the 15% tax, because I still deal weed locally and really don't want to be investigated. Would paying the capital gains tax put me at a lower risk for being investigated though? Or would I just be better off trying to stay off their radar entirely.

Yea but if I ever want to cash out to buy a house, expensive car, w/e I would probably get investigated. I'm not that worried about getting audited by the IRS, I would just play dumb college freshman that doesn't know jack about taxes, and the way BTC is taxed right now is so sketch anyways I doubt I would go to jail if I agreed to pay the back taxes. The main thing I'm worried about is if I was investigated they might figure out where the money came from. If they looked into my financial rerecords it would be pretty obvious based on my amazon purchases etc. that I made the money illegally (excessive quantities of mylar packaging for shipping marijuana over SR, etc). And they even have the original SR servers and could probably figure out exactly who I was to go after me. I just want to avoid any sort of investigation.
