How d they link the transactions? Connect thru tor and they don't know who I am....
How would you say that blockchain info compares to Mycelium if mycelium also does tor??.

If I want to buy a hardware wallet I have two main options: ledger and Trezor. That's direct competition. I think most would go with Ledger. I hope you can lower the price so people will turn towards the more secure device. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:15:18
Yes, but when he says: "They are significantly *less* valid for Electrum because a compromise of some keys at one point in time doesn't compromise all future keys generated by your wallet; a compromise of a root pubkey requires you to recreate the wallet to get your privacy back."
Why is there a difference? Is he talking about the master public key? Explain why Electrum is a better solution.

Thanks. What kind of technical knowledge do I need to set the xpub/xpriv using command line tools? 
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:06:51
Any plans to lower the price of TREZOR?
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:17:05
Good sign for Winklevii?
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:31:24
Same. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:45:49
Look at the exchange between Peter Todd and slush
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:02:04
Cool. Thanks again. 
5000 bits
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:48:06
Thanks. I don't really understand these things on a technical level so I'm just trying to learn. I appreciate you responding. You say the USB could be insecure. How does Trezor get around this if it is also USB? 
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:14:58
Any significance that NYSE is an investor? Good sign for the Winklevii?
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:34:36
Not at all. 
Say I've been using Bitcoin and want a hardware wallet. I see two options which offer similar security. I'm saying simply because of price a lot of people will go with Ledger. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:19:42
Hahaha...why? 
Also when electrum and multibjt and armory support trezor...will you be able to initialize the trezor with these clients instead of only at mytrezor?
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:21:34
What other security holes are there in TREZOR?
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:58:19
Privacy. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:38:00
Privacy concerns 
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:53:58
Great explanation. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:29:00
Thanks. Is this the same as the master public key in Electrum? As noted in my other comment, I struggle to understand why Electrum offers more privacy in this area, at least according to Peter. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:08:48
I think only privacy. Basically if someone were to get that key they would have a full read only version of your wallet. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:50:42
What does it have to do with the privacy of the computer? I guess I was thinking more of backdoors. Like peter said, we don't know what MyTrezor does with the master public key. So that is an issue with the server, not the computer, correct? 
So what do you use for cold storage? 
I also agree they were right to release it before other wallets supported it. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 23:20:02
And 39 is the specific words which can be used? 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:37:09
Long exchange here re: security: 
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:30:45
Again, I'm not arguing which is better. I'm saying that if someone is in the market for a hardware wallet there aren't a lot of options (2), and a lot will go with Ledger just because it is cheaper. Again I agree Trezor offers better security. 
Edit: and yes I'd love to see Satoshi Labs review the ledger wallet. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:43:21
I agree with you. 
What do you mean when you say Electrum publishes a list of addresses? 
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:37:32
Again, you're missing the point. Trezor is more secure. But a Bitcoin noob might not know that and just buy Ledger because it is cheap. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:11:06
Understood. Thanks for the great responses. Do you work for Trezor, or just a big fan? I see most of your history is about the device
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:45:29
How is Trezor safe against this? 
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:13:52
Yes but you are now starting to get competition. I personally believe Trezor to be more secure, but a newer bitcoiner who wants a hardware wallet and doesn't understand coding will go with Ledger 9/10 IMO because of price. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:39:09
Here is an interesting exchange re: security 
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:21:50
I have a great solution for you: don't listen to him  
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:50:01
Yes...it sounds good...but if I use a tor proxy on Mac how is it different from running tails?
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:53:03
if electrum looked like Hive I'd be in heaven 
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:27:39
I'm using electrum...not Bitcoin core
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:59:52
No...there is a way to connect through TOR on any electrum install...so I can connect thru tor even if not using tails
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:11:20
If I connect thru tor it will block them from seeing my real IP address. That is what is important to me
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:10:24
What are the privacy features of DarkWallet?
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:53:53
Thanks... Exactly what I'm looking for! Do I need to connect to a .onion rlectrum server to or does that not matter?
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:54:46
Thanks... Does connection to .onion add any benefit or no?
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:07:59
Not technical :(
Is there really no easier way to do???
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:53:24
Any differences between tails and whonix?
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:12:25
No I used python trezor tools to generate away from myTrezor.com...that site is privacy wreck. Right now I'm either gonna go with trezor on electrum routed thru tor or maybe tails ...thanks for the help...I still trouble understanding why tails s more private tho as long as electrum only uses tor connection 
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:11:55
Yes agreed. This is why tor with electrum is very important...so how do I connect thru tor?
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:18:43
What is the difference? Both hide my IP
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:48:31
Yes thanks... Good overview...I use Trezor with electrum so the coins are secure...I just need more privacy. Tails looks good for security too but I have that with Trezor already...my main concern is one server logging all my balances...so seems like just connecting tor can help my problem 
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:18:04
This dude just wants your Bitcoin...there's no official announcement on how the blockchain voting will work
People here believe anything posted here....
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:30:42
Wait..so I don't need an electrum server? I can connect electrum direct to btcoin QT?
@_date: 2015-02-20 15:33:13
I should say an indication of the US gov's view on Bitcoin fungibility. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 09:19:10
Is there any security risks like flashing false balances or anything similar?
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:37:29
We can learn from all the all who had so many users and transactions (over 90,000) per day that the developers had to consider changing limit..... Oh....wait....
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:47:28
Does this work on Mac? Holy crap this is complicated!!!!
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:20:42
What are the advantages/possible issues with GreenAddress controlling one of the keys in a 2-2 multisig? 
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:30:07
Thanks...I heard its best to run exchanges with PHP
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:59:56
@_date: 2015-02-07 09:49:33
Right. There's no limit on the passphrase, right? So if someone really wants more security they could just generate another seed with dice and use that as passphrase. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:21:41
How? If you still need setup myTrezor.com they will still have the MPK/xpub. 
So i see electrim does not really solve this issue?!
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:31:22
Isn't it impossible to know for sure if my key in the 2-2 is leaked or not? There's no way for me to know if they have both keys. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:24:30
I see nothing that says these addresses have anything to do with the election
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:23:05
But either way an SVP has my IP...so its nothing specific to tor
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:45:25
How so?
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:04:49
Some Qs ...
1. So when I setup with green address this will give me a new seed completely different from the one I get with myTrezor?
2. Does greenaddress give me the option to add a passphrase on top of the seed or do I have to make the passphrase in my Trezor? 
3. What happens if green address server goes offline? I'm scrwed then.
