I like how you have used your cell phone's battery power to describe Justin Sun's tweet and Trump's comment on these issues.

 - is it okay for you and your legacy to be mocked for the next 100 yrs for your naive statements ? - People are already laughing at your twitter posts when BTC was $40.  Just because you are trying to sell more shit bricks, don't make yourself be a joke in history books.  Deep down you know you are wrong.  Accept it .. Be a man .. and BTC owners can also buy some gold and keep you happy if that is what you want.   Life is too short man ! come on.

My interpretation is that it hints at the history of cash money and the dirty dealings / wars / atrocities it has committed. Yet / we get people like  Steven Mnuchin / US Secretary of Treasury applaud the "strongest" guardrails of AML in US and "pushes back" on nefarious activities ever being done w/ cash : [

Great video. Unfortunately, his tie is a bit distracting.

He sure did play a vital role in elevating the optics of bitcoin to the general masses. Truly relentless warrior and a superb mentor.

Absolutely terrible and inaccurate video.  It reminded me of my kid - taught him Bernoulli's principal to explain the science of flight. On his presentation day, he packed it with so many inaccuracies that it defied the laws of physics.  Obviously, I did a poor job of explaining and he is too young to get it.  The editors of this video sounded the same / they barely understood bitcoin and created a garbage that is packed with wrong claims and very painful to watch.  Atleast my kid's presentation was cute. This video is just garbage created by uneducated adults.

I am very much surprised that the court doesn't find this fraud in 'contempt of the court' for constantly producing fake documents / fake titles / fake signatures and the list goes on.  Does the court realize the severity of the situation ? Put him in jail for turning the judicial system into a complete joke.

Economic foundations built on fluff money continue to show fracture lines and set the stage for global implosion.  Many years ago, the only option out was to hoard gold - customary practise by the rich, while the poor would burden the pain of economic collapse. Today, Bitcoin offers an opportunity for the poor to escape the downturn and be a true global citizen.

Just like a typical Bollywood movie and crypto market - way too much happening at the same time.  I feel dizzy watching this.

Everyone had enough chance to load up at $3k / $4k / $5k / $6k / $7k and today at $8k.  This train doesn't stop for the weak.
