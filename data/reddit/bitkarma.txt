Now how do we explain that to Core in a way that their PhD addled minds can understand?
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:28:38
Core devs have already explained more than enough times that people capable of initially installing a node are in no way up to the task of upgrading their nodes even when given a 6 month lead time. It has also been pointed out that all current nodes are computationally inept to the point that they can barely download the current blockchain. The only solution is to implement the most complicated and "sexy" solution that can be sold to the mere mortals of the cryptocurrency world.

I have no idea how you could possibly keep your coins hidden from a surveillance state. As soon as you moved or spent them in a way that could attach any form of ID they would be tainted and watched forever.

Why not give them a call? Transactions get flagged all the time for "suspicious" activity. 2 minutes on the phone and it probably won't happen again.

Fees currently only account for 1-2% of revenue generated by mining a block. There is no real incentive to propagating an updated block header including new transactions to their miners until the nonces of the current block have been exhausted.
I can foresee a fee structure in the future where miners are incentivised to include a transaction as soon as possible and that the fee goes down for each block that doesn't include the transaction.

Higher trade volumes in China generally mean a higher market price there. It has been this way for quite a while now. One has to at least wonder if the government isn't involved in order to discourage using BTC as a vehicle to move funds out of the country.

Mining pools mostly use the [getwork]( RPC method to break the mining process down into chunks of work. The larger the chunk and the fewer times you have to call that method, the less time your miner spends idle.
Some miners have moved to using getblocktemplate or StratumMP, but that isn't exactly the norm yet.
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:45:45
Semi-related: I've asked the same question about people that cold-store signed transactions as their backup plan.
What if your signed transaction from time immemorial does not have enough fee to get processed, or maybe even relayed, and you no longer have that key to re-sign the transaction?
Maybe it is far enough in the future that for some reason your transaction script is deprecated and no longer accepted?
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:45:17
Full blocks are an outrage. Miners should include less transactions per block so that the blocks aren't so full!  /s

Coinbase is so conflicting for me personally.
Great interface. Reliable. Accessible. Secure. Full featured. Legal compliance. Seemingly everything you could possibly want and arguably the most legit company ever in bitcoin's history. 
I use their services. I trust their services. I still can't bring myself to store more than a few coins there though.
We have been burned so many times by so many seemingly legitimate companies that it is hard not to embrace the "be your own bank" mantra at this point.

I don't use checks or money orders to buy coffee. Some forms of payment don't make sense for some types of transactions, but it doesn't make them any less valid as a form of payment for other transactions.

Sending a segwit transaction requires that your wallet be segwit. That means you have to create a new segwit wallet and create an on-chain transaction to move funds from your old wallet to the new segwit wallet. The transaction sending from the old wallet to the new wallet is not a segwit transaction.
I'm not sure how the logistics would work for converting thousands (millions?) of wallets at once. It would probably make much more sense to only convert new wallets.
There is also the issue of compatibility. Older wallet implementations might balk at newer segwit addresses. Some users wouldn't understand when their software or another service refused to send to a new segwit address. That would lead to an influx of support requests on both ends.
TLDR; The technical implementation of segwit is simpler than the logistical implementation. Status quo is easier.

Coinbase is US based and has been a major player and advocate for a long time. It has been a long time since I have had an issue with them and when I did they have fantastic support.
All of the exchanges have their own advantages. I switch between then semi-regularly for trading. Still go back to Coinbase for normal purchases and investment purchases. If I didn't already have a setup that I like I would feel comfortable keeping coins in their multi-sig vault.

There are a few early adopters that stand to profit immensely. Anyone who got in later could be handsomely rewarded. Those that are already rich in other currencies will simply transfer their wealth. Bitcoin is valuable for a huge number of reasons and wealth distribution is very low on that list.

The Core daemon is tough to get running stably. I ended up using a process monitor to keep it running. Seems to get more stable as it runs. This has been my experience with several pieces of software that make use of LevelDB and BDB.
I have a box running Toshi and it has been pretty solid. If it isn't a mission critical system you might try that.
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:30:50
I won't make any claims as to the compatibility of backups between programs. I try to stick to BIP39 and paper wallet backups as nearly all programs support them. I did have an issue recovering an Electrum mnemonic backup because it uses 13 words instead of the 12 that most others use.
Just make sure you TEST any backup method before trusting it for coin storage. Nothing worse than having a backup and not being able to restore it.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:41:44
If you are new then I would recommend against using an exchange for trading until things settle down again. Coinbase is where I usually get my coins however. 
mSIGNA is probably the most complicated of those wallets to get started with, but it has great features. It is what I use. Hard to go wrong with any of them though.
Personally, I would go find the thread that had the Ledger hardware wallets on sale. If you follow their instructions it is almost foolproof to keep your coins safe.

I have to agree with the premature optimization problem. All developers love the glory of fighting dragons. Same thing can be said for all vocal people in small communities I believe.
I also think that Bitcoin is tough for most programmers to get into because it is intimidating. The literature and code both require a pretty heavy computer science background to fully understand.
There have been quite a few mailing list messages and pull requests that are completely ignored. Not that they were revolutionary ideas, I just don't think hard work should be completely ignored. I think that makes it feel a bit like a club that you can't get into at this point in the game.
After that you end up with the entrepreneurs and big idea investors. Most people simply aren't cut out to be successful in that game.
It also has to be said that the Core devs and LN devs are pretty much the same thing at this point. Just saying.
I don't think it is that people don't want to solve problems. The barrier of entry is simply a very high one. Still a lot of people out there that are waiting on their chance to try. No reason for panic just yet.

Coinbase is the way to go these days when it comes to introducing people to Bitcoin. Mobile app is easy to use. Lots of security features. And most importantly it includes Buy AND Sell options.
I think most people are leery of trying Bitcoin because it feels very one way. They shy away when it feels like they have no way of getting their money back.
Multi-sig is great for securing funds, but honestly, the kind of people that can't/won't secure their funds in an easy to secure app are never going to bother with the cumbersome nature of multi. I'm not sure multi can ever be made "Mom Test" friendly.
Edit: The people that put enough funds into Bitcoin that they need to start worrying about security should probably hire a consultant anyways. We have come a long ways in the past few years when it comes to keeping coins safe. Extortion and scams are far more a threat than theft at this point.

I do not like the idea of protocol changes based on the mining power of parties with vested interests... however, Reddit has down voting for the very purpose of user moderation. Some subs mark posts as NSFW if they go against the grain.
I believe that the biggest issue people have in this sub is a single person deciding what is and is not appropriate and deleting posts and banning users based on criteria that are not clearly defined and must be learned through experience. A warning on occasion would be nice.
