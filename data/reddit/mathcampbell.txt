Hey. Yes...can you process it into cacao mass (also known as cocoa liquor)?
If not that's fine, it just saves me from doing it (and means I'm not paying to ship the husks!)

I live in a place with a lot of mass-transit.  Also, I never got my licence (which bitcoin was going to fund), which is a little odd, given I'm now 30.  I was living on the very bottom for a long while.  Starting to creep up out of the abyss of poverty, and managed to get really lucky to be gifted some bitcoin (and buy 2 at $7) when it wasn't worth much and held.
It was going to be our ticket to a better life.  I hope that bastard is happy with my better-life-chance-money.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:57:14
I'd say no, since MtGox kept the private keys...
Hence the need to re-program the yubikey device itself.

I'd normally say thanks but you're OK...
As it is, all donations gratefully accepted.  It was our wedding fund :(  I stupidly transferred back to MtGox for a quick trade or two and got caught by the shutdown.  Bastards.

@_date: 2014-12-02 16:02:32
I agree.
I miss my 3.7BTC.
Damn you MtGox.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:45:44
Unrelated I know, but what are the possibilities of any of us normal guys getting anything back out of Gox?  I had 2.32, deposited quite late in the scheme of things...will we each be getting an equal share of the remaining BTC? Or a portion based on the % of total outstanding debt to each creditor etc?
Anyone got any thoughts?
Ps Congrats to When I lost my 2.32BTC, it scuppered plans for my wedding, and if the price rise had continued/I'd held a bit longer, a deposit on a house.  I can only imagine the hell you have gone through if you're not wealthy outside of those 800BTC.  Congrats.

@_date: 2014-02-25 13:50:26
I had 3.38.  Not much by many standards, but represented for me a massive sum.  I got in really early and held.  I was in the process of migrating to a safe wallet when Gox stopped BTC withdrawal.  Would have been a downpayment on a house, a car (still haven't got my own), or perhaps enough to get married finally.
Now some rich cunt is a tiny bit richer, and we'll probably never find them.  I hope the die penniless and alone.
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:26:03
There seem to be many...I was just wondering if anyone had any recommendations...
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:52:57
Downpayment here on a small place would be about £5000 - not inconceivable with the way prices were rising.
To put in context, I have an overdraft and I live month to month, I have no other real savings so this represented about 95% of my entire wealth.  All so some rich cunt can get richer.
Well, looks like my wedding won't be going ahead this year (was either gonna hold and use for house/car or cash out and use for wedding).
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:09:58
Well if MtGox is gone, I'll have lost basically the largest sum of money I had - I bought in early, and have left it to grow, occasionally trading.
I had 3.38 BTC.  Not much compared to Mr. Millionaire here.  But for me, it was a car, maybe the downpayment on a house, a chance for a better life, now all gone so some rich cunt can be a little richer.
Hope it brings them nothing but pain.
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:25:39


Thanks, but unfortunately as I said, I lost a lot in MtGox.  I don't want to let a 3rd party have my bit coins...
I'd be "ok-ish" with blockchain.info or the likes...but certainly not an actual market or processing site...
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:12:56
I bought at $15.  I almost sold at $1200, but miss that boat, so I was holding till it rises above, then was planning on selling to pay for wedding, or maybe a car or downpayment on a house.
Unfortunately, I can't feel anything now, because some ASSHOLE STOLE MY FUCKING MONEY!!

Yep...also house prices here are cheap - i could get a 2 bedroom apartment here for about £60,000, and at 10% downpayment, well feasible if the price had gone to about $3000, as I am sure it will...

There are people who can do trading.

Part of me thinks he's been hoping and awaiting arrest for some time.
Sure, Japanese police aren't known for being nice, and Japanese prisons are seen as quite rough and unpleasant compared to western ones, but far better being arrested by the police and imprisoned, than being hunted down once out of Japan by any number of exceptionally annoyed and impulsive individuals...
Better decorating a prison cell than a tree somewhere...

Theft, like rape, murder, and other crimes is and never can be justified.
Was I stupid to transfer my in back to MtGox to do a trade? Yes.  I don't deny it.
Does that justify theft, that any of the victims of this crime "deserve" to not have their property returned? No.
Saying people don't deserve their money back is on the same see-saw as saying therefore Karpeles and those involved don't deserve punished.

Late response I know, but I take it a) you've never been to Scotland (topology makes mobile anything tricky), and b) you haven't seen how much it costs to install a public wi-fi system.  I have.  I asked for it to be costed a couple years ago.  The fact we don't have it still should indicate to you that it's not cheap!
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:03:03
I think (and speaking as a minor politician I guess the charge "you're just saying that for yourself' could be levelled at me, but I believe this!) that democracy in the form of democratic representation works better than actual full-on democracy for this reason:
Nobody wants, nor cares, to make the myriad of complex, difficult decisions that even minor politicians such as I have, have to make, on a daily basis.  This is a full-time job.
Lets spin out a wee thought-experiment.
After many years of persuasive argument by the Anarchists Unite, the whole country transitions to Voting 2.0, where everyone votes on everything, via electronic voting.  Every decision made by the state, local and national, that affects you, you get a say on.  True democracy at last!!
If you're, say, a plumber, well, Joe, you don't have time to go fix that leaking tap, because we need your thoughts on the current revenue spend for education; there's a 5% variance of approved funds due to heating going up in price over the winter; should we allocate that from current revenue and pick up the slack before year ed, or make a new variance?
What's that, you don't know?  Well, here, read this 48 page briefing summary, and let me know by day's end.
Oh, also, since you're now in charge of voting on ALL decisions made for your area, both local and national, we also need your thoughts on the new defence treaty with Denmark, a security briefing from MI6 on the threat from Daesh to our interests in south-east Asia, and a trade delegation from Chad are here next week, and we need you to help decide whether we give them full credentials or merely meet?
What, you've not got time for all that? Let alone the professional competency to make adequate decisions...
But you're in charge, Joe.  You and every other person...
See, Joe ISN'T in charge...he has opinions and thoughts on a few key policy areas, but no real understanding of the complexities involved, nor any interest or competency in the nitty-gritty stuff that isn't that exciting but is absolutely needed to be done for the safety/security/ecnomonic and social interests of society.
So, Joe doesn't vote.  Now, Billy-Bob, who used to be a member of "Anarchists Unite" before the new Voting 2.0 came in and is currently unemployed, DOES vote.  On everything.  No matter how small the issue he researches and comes to a conclusion for good or ill.
Not many of Billy-Bob's neighbour's realise that sometimes he's the only one voting on these matters in the area.  Him and the members of "Destroy the State", who are busily trying to make things worse in order to precipitate a revolution.
So now you have a situation where many of the key albeit uninteresting decisions, instead of being made by everyone, are made by a very small self-selecting group with a pre-decided agenda.
Now where does that sound familiar?
Only difference is, whereas in Voting 1.0, these people clearly state their case, and are selected by the democratic will of the people, now, in 2.0, they're selected by, well, themselves.  Since no-one else cares about the nitty-gritty but people with those prior-agendas, you've now got the same situation as before, only with no way of removing those people's influence from power except getting a mass-outcry from the apathetic masses, who only usually care about big issues...
Like I said, representative democracy isn't perfect.  But at least at the moment you get to choose the representatives, and there's at least some transparency in it.
It's broken in many places; most prominently in the US, where they have so much lobbyist money (legally) flowing around, it's untrue, and the apathetic masses seem not to care.  But it's still better than the alternative.
@_date: 2015-03-01 15:55:04
Thanks for this response...not a bad idea...
The public banknote approach was one Id considered, although more likely a coloured coin - since bitcoin fluctuates so much, a coloured coin tied to UK£ is probably easier for retailers...now I know how to solve the private/public key banknote issue...

Mesh net much more doable. 
Alas, I too come into this with a tech background (programmer/designer), but since I was elected I got a little flavour of how local government works. 
Take your estimate. Add a zero, double the time. That's local government.

The reason I suggested implementing a physical side to the idea was that small retailers here are unlikely to have the expertise to implement an alt coin or bitcoin directly, and certainly not the infrastructure; in addition, our tourism is dependent on cruise-ship passengers...
I figure an ATM &amp; info stall at the dock when they arrive would be the best way to hook them in, and sell them an alt coin...
I'm just wondering if it would be possible to issue an alt coin that's tied to UK Pounds Sterling, but backed by Bitcoin (i.e. a coloured coin)...
If so, that'd be the easiest to implement, since retailers could give change in UK money (if they wished), treat the notes essentially as gift vouchers on their current POS systems, and yet when we're selling the coin to the tourists, we can use existing bitcoin-based online-trading, they can convert freely between the physical token and the actual coin, and if they decide to "cash in" their tokens for the alt coin, they can do so online when they get home, ending up with bitcoin or whatever else they wish to trade to...
I know a little about coloured coins as I'm involved in Scotcoin (which wouldn't be suitable for use in this scenario because it's launch and lack of currency tie make it very hard for retailers to adopt)...
Just look about the easiest way to a) get a crypto coin in daily use (even if through the use of physical tokens), and b) incentivise a bit of tourism-spending in my constituency...
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:59:16
What...you mean my 2 million Scotcoin isn't worth shit, and I couldn't sell it even if I wanted to?
(Seriously, I now own around 2% the entire supply.  Utterly pointless.  Dev swanned off to be a stockbroker in Asia, "community" is run by a woman who has difficulty understanding how to spell "crypto coin" and thinks vaccines are giving children autism.  Gonna hold just in case they're ever worth more than a cup of coffee...)
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:10:04
And then all retailers need the tech in place to deal with bitcoin at their existing POS.  They also need a stable cheap/free way to convert Bitcoin back to fiat without losing money due to fluctuations.
They also need the knowledge of how to do this.
Also, the tourists all need to have a mobile device, and, more critically, internet access - you'd be surprised how many people don't have any net access on holiday, thanks to shady telco's and their "roaming charges".
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:55:26
End of the day we're all citizens...
I think private law is a bad patch to the system, which will end up in a situation described in Neal Stephenson's "Snow Crash", closely followed by the later future he posits in "The Diamond Age".
Personally I'd be fine with that, I'd join a clave...
But I think the current system (at least here in Scotland), isn't dead yet, and can still be made better.
As for the problems you have in the USA...your number one issue there isn't representation, or the huge bribes (sorry, "campaign contributions") that get bunged back and forth.  It's the companies.
You have turned over your country to mega-rich multinationals, who have no interest in the public good, nor in good governance, or indeed anything other than profit.
Wresting control away from such hugely wealthy landed interests requires nothing short of a revolution.  Either a peaceful, democratic one, formed by entering into a new era of politics, with canddiates/parties that refuse any campaign money from any company.  Good luck with that.
Or via the more traditional method of revolution.  That's not optimal either.
Wish I had ideas for you, but alas, I'm stuck here.  I've got my own battle here to get my country free of London, whose attitude towards everything is "Gee, look how great things are going for shareholders in America.  Let's do that too!".

I like this aspect quite a lot.
Plastic cards could be simple and cheap to implement, with only a QR code on them...and a separate one to "charge" it;
This could easily be run in concert with the physical notes.
I'm thinking the way forward here may be a coloured-coin, with parity to UK Sterling (so retailers can convert 1:1, and give change etc.)
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:33:01
Sorry...I just figured the debate we need at the moment has got enough "soundbite" politicians...

I could have just gone "no, this isn't the time for that". But why bother? Go big or go home.
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:05:04
Tourists may not have the technology, or may not have internet access (roaming charges are a serious thing!), or may not have the technical ability, and finally, even if they do, local retailers may not have the funds/tech/infrastructure/ability to implement a full digital currency.
Everyone already "gets" paper currency....

No, I made a couple of bad trades, and so lost bitcoin overall....I have 3.72 BTC.  I had 5.02.
I lost the 1.2 due to selling right before a price spike and losing my nerve after 12 hours of it staying higher, and bought back in at a loss.
Ironically, about 2 hours later, another price crash, which if I'd held my nerve and waited for, and bought at the bottom, I'd have made about 1BTC in profit :(  Lesson of this tale: I'm shit at trading.

Not so sure...
For all it got the press riled up, Silk Road was never really that big.  Sure, it got a lot of traffic, and had a LOT of registered accounts, but most of those were people going on there to take a look.  Only a small percentage were actually trading, allbeit often quite large sums.
MtGox is EVERYTHING.  Everyone has an MTGox account.  Even traders that use other exchanges will have a gox account.  It's the established goto for a btc price.  If Gox went out, a very large group of active traders, about 80% of the entire bitcoin market, would be totally up the swanney, more so if gox take their fiat and btc with them.  Jesus, I have funds there (withdrawing now, I'm not trading much these days so...).
SR was a big news story, but no real effect.  MtGox probably wouldn't be that huge a news story, it's not that sexy unless it were hacked etc.  Even regular banks closing don't get headlines unless they're massive...
But the effect of them going....ripples in the pond...
