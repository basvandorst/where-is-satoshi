Still not smart enough to do a strategic HODL. Wonder who is going to buy this....

I’ll tell you why it will never reach zero. At a price of $0.001 I will buy all outstanding coins. As the sole owner, I won’t sell any coin under $500k anymore. All it takes at that point is someone buying a fraction of a BTC from me and the charts will jump from 0.001 to 500k instantly. So don’t worry, Hodl on.

Banks now understand that this is not stoppable. Hence, as shown in this video, they are moving to their next game plan: co-opt it. They want to regulate it, own the infrastructure around it and force the system to comply with KYC and thereby declare illegal “free use, opt in” crypto like we largely know today and where they have no middle man position.
All the “money laundering” and “compliance” buzzwords that are thrown around are just aimed to push a narrative for regulation which they will be happy to lobby for and largely write themselves.
Obviously this is not the way I would like to see it. Crypto must stay out of the hands of the banks and stay under control of the self sovereign people.

Don’t worry man! Its better to have a few satoshis than being a nocoiner. Welcome to the show. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.
