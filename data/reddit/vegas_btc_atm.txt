Yes, taking our power back from the uber corrupt bankers is the socially responsible thing to do for the benefit of all man kind. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 18:44:31
Any best guesses when this thing actually happens? 
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:21:14
I had this thought when Btc was at $50 but was unfortunately was too big of a pussy to get balls deep at that time.  I needed more foreplay

6. The price of Bitcoin will almost always explode after you sell. HODL 
@_date: 2014-09-16 06:55:44
I get that a lot

Today isn't April fools right?

The real question is how long until I can store and purchase bitcoins with paypal. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:17:51
I'd like to see more bitcoin related companies buying advertising.

And wearing gold chains and diamond rings is better? Get out in public a little would ya

Clearly you've never worked with the U.S. Gov. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:17:10
Sounds like this isn't the first time this has happened.  I'll be my own bank thank you very much.

Lets hope next year progresses faster than this.

Just used Purse for the first time and got a 8% discount when I ordered a Benq gaming monitor from Amazon. Hell yeah!!!
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:41:48
5 years from now this will go down in history like the 10k bitcoin pizza. Thanks for the future laugh and blaze one for me
@_date: 2014-09-23 00:30:02
Consumers need a reason to use the Bitcoin network. Discounts or coupons might be enough incentive.

Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:17:47
Why so worried?  If your kid said he wanted cash for a present would you be concerned? 
@_date: 2014-12-16 06:17:34
Mine is still the same :(
@_date: 2014-09-16 00:29:36
When bitcoin is at 100,000, i'll have a telsa with a plate that says BTC BOT IT
@_date: 2014-10-09 00:00:18
Well at least 1 country is getting this right. Hey Ben Lawsky, maybe you don't know what you're getting into. But I guess you need to make some grand political splash and see regulating bitcoin as your ticket to higher ground. Too ambitious to let your predecessor get the credit in 5 years?!

@_date: 2014-12-25 23:16:31
That immediately jumped out at me too as possibly sounding insulting to some people. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:48:28
Was the buy/sell over 10k?
@_date: 2014-09-08 20:15:00
Put the pipe down
@_date: 2014-08-30 01:09:35
Cheers to getting close to putting this behind you. The community loves you

Did China ban it again too
@_date: 2014-08-19 07:07:14
Interesting, but come on man

Deja Vu.  I feel like I read these same comments every week every week .  The only thing that changes is the numbers the numbers. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 23:06:44
Closer to the block reward halving. Can't wait for that day. Get your moon suit ready
@_date: 2014-10-21 10:32:16
Insert bitcoin. I don't think it unreasonable to consider a civil war  or mass atrocities over bitcoin within the next 10 years. The bankers will not go down without a fight as history proves.

I'll be back when I'm out of matcha
