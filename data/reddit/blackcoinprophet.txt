That's something at least. I would bet all USD, LTC, ETC funds together with any other remaining BTC funds (estimated at least 25k BTC) would lead to everyone getting at least 50% back, maybe 75% back if you factor in BFX profits which must be enormous over the last year.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:27:01
In a way I can see this working. If BFX stays open and continues trading, people who are owed the 36% are incentivised to talk up the exchange and encourage others to use it.
If trading resumes and trading volume is decent, investors will line up to inject cash into BFX. Then we'll get the rest of the money back.

Just because it wasn't "touched" doesn't necessarily mean you won't experience a socialised loss.
Businesses split up assets equally amongst creditors if the business becomes insolvent.

Can you indicate whether it's likely USD, LTC, ETC funds that were untouched by the hack will be used to cover the losses?
i.e. sum up all assets and then split 70% to all users? 
Or will it likely be just Bitcoin holders affected?

You should at least wait until you find out what you will be offered.
It's likely whatever you are offered now is more than you will get by the time forced bankruptcy proceedings are finished in a year or two, because we will be right at the bottom of the list of creditors.

To be fair they have to:
- Settle all trades and work out what assets are left
- Launch a *secure* version of the site which can't be hacked like the last one
- Work out how to handle 60 million dollars worth of losses fairly
Plus also a ton of other things e.g. co-operating with law enforcement agencies, talking to potential investors etc.
All those things have to be done before they can give more information. How can they workout what haircut to give if they don't even know the sum of all their assets and what positions were affected or if they haven't explored avenues with investors or discussed things with their legal counsel? You think they are going to not talk to law enforcement and instead prioritise other stuff?
This was always going to take days, don't be naive.
I would rather they take a few days and calmly decide what to do than rush and do a half ass job. And Zane is just doing his job, stop shooting the messenger. He can't pull made up information out of his ass.
Speaking as someone who had 6 figures worth of BTC on BFX so I should be as angry as anyone.

A big part of the problem is 8 million bitcoins were mined when the prices were dirt cheap.
As we know those Bitcoins haven't disappeared. That's a huge chunk of the market cap.
All it takes is some of those people slowly cashing out to create huge downward pressure. There's been posts on here showing some rich old wallets systematically being drained of thousands of btc a month and being dumped. And that's the one's doing it in a very obvious way.
Look at NXT. No inflation (so you can't blame miners dumping next NXT each day), no enormous businesses accepting NXT and then dumping it for $ and yet still there is lots of downward price pressure. And that is a coin where the early adopters made ridiculous gains.
The other thing is businesses accepting BTC and selling for FIAT immediately. I believe the majority of businesses immediately exchange the majority of their received BTC for FIAT. Ironically, each major new business that accepts BTC results in a little bit more price pressure on a daily basis.

Synechist the PR guy also wrote a very eloquent explanation here that may shed light on how XC works:
Ok, there's layer 1: the Xnode protocol
- nodes communicate with one another using an end-to-end encrypted protocol, so that anyone who intercepts their messages can't decipher them.
- nodes communicate directly; they don't use any trusted third parties or central servers. Therefore there's no one point of failure or attack.
Layer 2: an ad hoc meshnet
- when you make a private payment, the first thing that happens is that your app sets up a network with a bunch of other nodes that are making payments at the same time as you.
- this network exists only for the duration of the transaction, and thus has no permanent infrastructure that can be attacked.
- since this network is a mesh, it does not encounter problems if nodes drop out of the network during the transaction. Thus it's robust against DOS attacks (i.e when a node refuses to sign, which breaks other technologies, like CoinJoin).
Layer 3: trustless mixing
- when you make a private payment, a transaction is built up between all the nodes in a meshnet. 
- they pass the transaction around in a very clever way **(analogous to Coinshuffle)** in order to send coins to their intended destinations on behalf of other nodes.
- once the transaction is ready, each node checks that its own coins are going to the right destination, and if all is in order, the node signs the transaction.
- the signing is done in a very clever way so that no node knows which other node's coins they're forwarding.
- the coins are forwarded to their destination from a different address to the one that a forwarding node receives them on, so that there's no link on the blockchain between sender and receiver.
- if there's a problem then a node will refuse to sign. This makes the whole transaction unable to be processed, and thus no node can steal the coins that it's forwarding on behalf of another node.
- when this occurs, the nodes are able to reverse the passing-around procedure and discover which node caused the trouble. This node gets kicked off the mesh, and the transaction proceeds as per usual.
Layer 4: multipath
- when you make a private payment, the coins aren't sent in one go, but in fragments, making it impossible for anyone to tell how much you actually sent.
The ways in which all this is private:
- multipath conceals the amount you send or receive.
- mixing conceals the sender and the receiver.
- the trustless nature of the mixing ensures that nodes can't steal coins and that they can't know whose coins they're forwarding.
- the Xnode protocol ensures that nobody can decipher any of these messages in the first place.
- in addition, using the XC TOR Stick conceals your IP address.
- and, finally, when we add stealth addresses to XC, then when someone pays you, not even they will discover the address you receive the payment on, and so you don't have to trust them to keep private the address that your coins are on.
Basically, there's nothing else to make private after all this. The entire thing is concealed; none of your personal information is given away. So it's 100% privacy.

These posts always demonstrate a lack of understanding how the underpinning Bitcoin economy works.
In 10 years time there will be way too many coins being mined per day getting dumped on the market to be able to sustain such a ridiculously high price.
I can't recall how many coins get mined a day exactly but if the rate halves by twice since then, you're still looking at several hundred million worth of Bitcoin being dumped on the market *each and every day*. The global demand would have to be absolutely phenomenal to support that. And the Bitcoin infrastructure would have to be lightyears in front of where it is now.
I think astronomically high prices are feasible, but only in line with appropriate reductions in bitcoin minting.
People also often say things like "23 trillion dollars of money is hidden in tax havens, if Bitcoin captures 10% of that blah blah". That is part of the reason why all the legit exchanges have KYC etc.
I know the counter arguments that are coming to my points as I've had this discussion before and it always goes around in circles. However I will say that I was telling similar to guys who said 5k-10k bitcoin prices are dead cert for this year a few months ago. People extrapolate from past performance way way too much in Bitcoin. 
Personally I think there will be another bubble but it could take until this time next year to get it. The current price has already priced in the good news which is happening now. And then we have major vendors accepting bitcoin which is kinda good but at the same time this often results in selling pressure on the price... that won't last forever and the tide will turn but it's another price suppressant.
Note - believe it or not I am a very significant BTC holder.

So the states which *do* require money transmitters to have money transmission licenses are states where Cryptsy are in trouble, since they are undoubtedly a money transmitter.

Blocknet has working cross atomic swaps over different blockchains so you can directly trade BTC for LTC for example. Any coin with CLTV automatically works.
Unlike Waves, Bitshares etc it doesn't use "IOU" coins or assets.
However there is no FIAT. USD Tether support will come though.

The main point I was trying to convey is if a lot of supporters with old accounts have been banned then of course a noticeable ratio of the remaining supporters will have new accounts. That's regardless of who is creating the new accounts (genuine Redditors or not).
My take on new accounts is some % are genuine, some % are formerly banned accounts who still want their voice heard and some % are paid shills. Nobody knows the numbers for those percentages.

You also have to take selection bias into account. A lot of vocal big blockers who were long time redditors have been banned from this subreddit.

Did you margin short it or did you just lose 50%? If you still have 50% left I wouldn't get too upset, crypto is crazy volatile right now and you could make it back in a blink of an eye.
FWIW I've had some pretty sickening losses in my time. Try not to think on it too much cos it can eat you up inside.

When you think about it though, if BTC reached $69k it would have become so widespread that Satoshi wouldn't need to cash out, he could just spend the BTC directly.

Well for me I happened to check my local news website, saw a headline with "breaking, Greece agreement reached" and the time was 3 minutes ago. I then checked the Bitcoin price and in the minutes before hand it had dropped almost $20 instantly. That's what I'm personally basing it on. I'm sure others who were checking Bitcoin's price around the time the news broke can confirm that. I live in Europe btw.
In terms of the wider community, as the dump happened there were many posts correlating it with Greece.
As for the China market, I would hardly describe the situation as levelled out in terms of investor confidence. A lot of people will still be spooked. And the draconian measures e.g. whales can't sell their holdings, aren't something that people will just wake up and forget the next day.

So Alistair posted the site originally. And it's newsworthy because your article now tells us that Alistair is behind it?
It's also obvious from the comments that Alistair is behind it. 
And I noticed you was posting enthusiastically in the comments of that topic too, when it wasn't even a cointelegraph topic? Seems like a bit of a conflict of interest to me.

There's only been one other rise like this in the last 12 months and that's when we tested 300 in feb/mar. If we hold above 300 and then move to 350 it's significant.
What's encouraging is, this rise is coming out of a long period of stability.
It's also good to see a healthy amount of nay sayers too. They will be the people buying back in if we break 400 and 500.

Apple are just too big and too popular in the mainstream consciousness to be steamrolled, even by the US government. Putting their hundreds of billions of stockpiled cash to one side, how do you think voters would react if the maker of their beloved iPhone was viciously bullied by the government for standing up for the rights of their customers. There would be uproar, the likes of which we haven't seen before.

1. To be fair lots of internet startups don't have real office addresses in the early days and instead put a virtual office on the paperwork. 
2. It's also extremely common for a domain to be registered with privacy protection. 
3. Additionally where do they claim to be a British business? 
4. As you point out, you don't know what their trading name is so it's pointless to claim they're not registered as a company anywhere (you don't know the trading name to look up).
@_date: 2015-09-05 23:23:34
Let me guess, it was a small amount of money? (probably not to you but relative to what others lost).
From the anecdotal reports I've read and heard, it seems like the small fish are being made offers. I've yet to hear from anyone who lost a substantial amount of funds being offered a refund.
@_date: 2015-09-13 14:58:02
That's a strange way to justify things. Yes, complying with these laws costs a shit ton of money. That doesn't mean building first and asking for "permission" later is courageous. I would call that stupid more than courageous as these businesses are brazenly breaking the law. 
It's also not fair on the businesses that are spending a fortune trying to comply or those businesses such as Kraken that are restricting the locations they operate in so that they don't break the laws.
@_date: 2015-09-13 14:45:26
Wow. I can't believe your ignorant answer even got an upvote. Go ahead and quote the precise parts of my post which are crap.
Did you read the direct link I put to the Fincen's website which responds to a letter which was written to them by a crypto currency exchange? That is an answer directly from the horse's mouth stating that they are a money transmitter and thus need the appropriate licenses.
I have no connection to Coinbase or Kraken, do you have a connection to an exchange? 
@_date: 2015-09-03 19:51:39
What you mean like that scam btc-e?
Are you sure they are even taking FIAT from people yet?
They could just mean based in the sense they saw that UK based address. Bitstamp has a UK address but no-one knows where they are truly based. The magazine probably just jumped to the same conclusion as you. The sentence doesn't even make sense: "CoinWallet (which is a UK-based Bitcoin mining and wallet)", so I wouldn't be surprised.
I actually think there's a fair chance Coinwallet may be shady. But the majority of your points are bullshit. The one thing you may have a point on is their anonymous status at the moment.
@_date: 2015-09-13 13:45:08
The Bitlicense is for New York. It doesn't cover the rest of the states of america.
Being "under UK regulators" is irrelevant, see fallacy 1. If they don't have the money transmission licenses they are operating illegally and in direct contradiction to Fincen's crypto guidance which was outlined in 2014.
Do Coinsetter and Bitcoin.de have the money transmission licenses?
@_date: 2015-09-13 16:40:04
Very true. But my point is the vast majority of exchanges haven't done that. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:42:51
As I just said we don't know what country they are registered in as a business.
Well done ignoring all my points.
edit since you've edited:
1. Not true.
2. Definitely not true. Stop making shit up. The first start up I tried (bittrex bitcoin exchange) has a private domain registration. Barclays bank has a private domain registration, must be a scam right?
3. Where does their website claim they are a british business? The article most likely knows as much as you do and is just going off the virtual office address.
4. Where do they claim their company trading name is CoinWallet?
@_date: 2015-09-13 18:05:24


That is incorrect. See 
They have money transmission licenses in quite a few states. You're right about California though.

Satoshi is suspected to have mined close to a million bitcoin in the early CPU mining days. But my understanding is there's been no movement of these coins and some conjecture he doesn't have the keys.
Winklevi are a known big holder!
It's also important to distinguish owner vs being in control of the coins. Bitstamp has held hundreds of thousands of BTC.
Karpeles? :P
I think there's a fair number of people owning 30-100k coins. But I doubt there's more than 2-3 people who own more than 200k coins.
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:46:38
Depends. I remember one of the auctions the bids were revealed to be over the current market price. That could spark some bullish sentiment in the current climate (though didn't last time). 
Conversely if the coins are bought cheap e.g. at $300 and the news leaks then expect dumps from people panicking.
In reality, China runs this market so we do what they do.

Well there's a bunch of Bitcoin tied up in btc-e that can't be sold now -&gt; less supply on the market.
I know when Gox went down it was massive but they were handling 80% of the non-chinese Bitcoin trades. Trading volumes are now much more evenly distributed - Gdax, Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp etc all have sizeable trading volumes.
