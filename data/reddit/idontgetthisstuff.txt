Southern Ontario. Nearest city most people have heard of is Toronto.

Sorry. I swear I'm not stupid. I've just never really understood computers very well.
I'll try to keep reading about this stuff.

Bringing money to meet someone from the internet seems like the sort of thing I'd tell my kids never to do. Is that actually safe? What would they give me in exchange for the money? How would I know I wasn't being cheated?

Maybe I'm not getting the hang of things. I thought I had to send the commands to the bot to make something happen, but it looks like it found them in my comment and executed them for me? That's... surprising.

I tried to follow the instructions in formatting help. Why didn't my list show up correctly?
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:39:07
Oh! I thought that was just advertisements. (Isn't that where websites usually put them? It seems like a bad place for important information.)
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:38:13
Is there somewhere I can read about the wrong things?
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:11:47
Thanks everyone for all of the help. I still feel like I'm a bit out of my depth, but I'll keep trying to read up on all this. There's lots of terms I don't understand yet, but  I'm not ready to admit defeat.

I think doctorrecommendedmus was trying to say that I'm Candadian, not American. :-)

Escrow! That's something I understand. That sounds like a useful feature.

So would I put my mailing address (a P.O. box) or my physical address (my street number) in the file?
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:45:03
I see. What are purchasing options for a Canadian?
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:59:40
Sorry... I'm new to all of this.
What's a subreddit?
What does 2 factor authentication mean? (Is that like when my bank makes me answer security questions when I log in from a new computer?)
What's a private key? (Other than something I shouldn't lose.)

I guess it would be hard to mug someone at the police station (or the Timmy Ho's down the street where they all get coffee).
If I don't have a smartphone, how would I verify the transaction? Would I have to bring my laptop?

Oh! I'm not in the US; I'm in Canada. Does that matter? I thought that part of the appeal of bitcoin was that it wasn't tied to any country. Why would I need to be in the US to use coinbase? I'm working on signing up as moral_agent suggested... should I stop?

Sorry, but what is a wallet? Is it the equivalent of a brokerage account?
If I ask him to set it up, that would spoil the surprise, wouldn't it? What information would I need to set it up for him?
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:32:23
Wow! Fast reply!
I think my list is fixed.
The gold analogy makes sense.
I'm trying to use coinbase.com now.

Okay. Let me make sure I understand what just happened.
You just sent me 1.0938 mBTC using some sort of forum macro. These are now sitting in limbo (in a wallet belonging to the bot?).
To get them, I have to confirm the transaction with the bot, which will put them in a wallet that bot created (will create?) for me. I do this by direct messaging the bot with "+ACCEPT". To actually use them I can withdraw them from that wallet and send them to a wallet I created by giving the bot my public key. I do this by direct messaging the bot with "+18GoM9yta43FJaSebn1o9GDDag9yVNF9ur ALL".
At that point, I'll have 1.0938 mBTC minus two transaction fees sitting in my wallet, right?
(This is seriously complicated, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of things.)

I wish that were true; I wish this level of detail weren't required. However, a lot of the resources people have been linking me to use these terms. (Heck, one of the first replies I got yesterday was "Yes you can give them as gifts. I set my friend up with their own blockchain.info wallet. My friend trusts me for this. You could also have your nephew set up their own wallet and send bitcoins to your nephew's address.")
When I first read it, it seemed like jibberish. Now, I think I finally sort of understand what this means.
I think what other people have been saying about still needing to idiot-proof the technology will help, but until then, I'm afraid that the concepts graysoda explained are actually important to understand.

Thanks for the links. I think I'm starting to understand this stuff.
