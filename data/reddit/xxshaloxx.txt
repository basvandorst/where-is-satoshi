This is a shortsighted strategy.

''Cant recall'' if it works for your senators, it should work for you guys too right?

basically trading by the hour/minutes on the difference, tends to be less profitable in the long turn

A price has been set and a agreement made, yeah they're not going to cancel it or else everyone who gets a pending transaction will have a serious advantage
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:53:42
Thats...shit, whats the point of a transaction fee then when they play with that. I read you use gemini, what I love about coinbase is its simplicity. Is Gemini fairly easy to use? what about Gdax which seems to be linked to coinbase and people always refer to as a alternative 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:13:04
With the ''actual worth'' I meant the market worth for a bitcoin. How can coinbase have its own price?  thats not really representatieve of what you're buying.

''based on a real story'' all over again

So I can make lots of money or lose lots of money?

Price is crashing, good for people that dont have coins or want to buy more
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:49:29
its at when you sell, not at when you get it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:52:42
To shreds you say?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:28
look at the context of the title man, he clearly wants to buy and a dip is the perfect moment for that hence a 'sale'
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:30:28
thanks for the info, might sound silly but you recommend buying at this point? I held off when it was around 2000 hoping it would get lower...its not going lower then 2000 is it XD
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:20:17
Thanks for the explanation, I'll check it out
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:21:46
can you give me a basic rundown on storage of cryptocoins? there seems to be the option to store if digitally or in hardware (hardrive).
Much appreciated
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:05:16
why not just go with bitcoin? genuin question, I understand the concept of diversifying by not putting all your money in one basket but it seems like bitcoin dictates what the other alt coins do. The only benefit BTC seems to have its 'the one'.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:19
everything is borked should clear up in a bit
