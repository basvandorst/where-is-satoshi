Manage the risk and tell your friends, if you think they might profit from this too. We saw this from another angle, but I can see where you are coming from.

They developed SegWit and third party services are boycotting them by not implementing it, why are they to be blamed? 
They even continued with the development of the LN, so they are taking it a step further.

@_date: 2018-01-10 07:18:13
They are not crippling the 1st layer, because the 2cnd layer is the ultimate fix to the problem. They saw in advance that Block size increases on the first layer, will not scale to mainstream adoption and will do more harm than good for decentralization, so they fixed this with 2cnd layer applications. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:28:40

@_date: 2018-01-24 08:59:11
That is the hook, once you leave some cash in the account, they start lifting the minimum amount that has to be in the account to qualify for it and this gets reviewed every year. 
Been there, was bend over, and got the burnt a$$hole. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:43:59
Yes, once they are centralized enough, they can do what they want. Only the rich people will be able to host BCash nodes, so they can determine the future for the coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:01:44
Nope, it was bad banking practices. { Fractional-reserve banking }

Proper research will reduce the risk. I took profits on the way up and monitored the technology and managed the risk. I used zero debt to fund the investment and received 800% return on my investment.

You not with me on this. They start by making the minimum amount say $500 p/m and a lot of people are hooked. Then they raise that $500 to $800 and later $1000 and so on. 
You were attracted to this "zero fee" account, because the minimum amount was low, but then they increase it and you start paying because you cannot afford to keep the larger amount in the account. That is why I say the lower amount is the hook. Very clever.

I have bitcoins and other people {customers} are willing to buy it for a price that are determined on the open market {supply and demand} 
How am I exploiting those customers? Did I force them to buy it at gunpoint?

I can just imagine the application of this. Let's say one of these Bitcoin faucets can implement this and remove all those micro payments from the Blockchain, then we will have much less "dust" transactions on-chain and much less congestion in the MemPool.

Other more secure algorithms is already ready developed to take it's place, when this happens. lol

Block size increases will change this in the future ;-&gt;
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:33:13
Why is the original code so important to everyone? If a second layer application can solve the problem and still retain the original Block size, then I do not see why it should not be done. 
Hanging onto Satoshi's original code, for the sake of doing it, is just stupid. 
Legacy Bitcoin addresses is still being used, so yea it is backward compatible. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:58:43
Redditor for 2 months, please explain why you think Block size upgrades should be the ONLY scaling method? Was Satoshi some God? {Most of his original code in the protocol has been changed and/or cleaned in any way}

@_date: 2018-01-03 10:28:17
In Roger's finale statement, he actually answered the big question - Can BCash scale. - His roadmap for scaling BCash is to apply the LN to Bcash. LoL
So they took the original Bitcoin Code, added some bigger blocks and also added Cash to the name and now they want to add the LN code to improve it. 
Is there no capable Dev's on the BCash side to develop their own solutions or do they just steal the BTC Core Dev's code and call it something else? 
A bunch of amateurs with money to burn. :-.&gt;

We do not have a problem with that, but Block size increases should not be your only upgrade option. If enough on-chain tx's warrant a Block size upgrade, then that should be done as planned. 
Just using Block size upgrades as your preferred scaling method, is where the problem comes in. Bigger Block sizes = centralization, which is bad.

Because BCash is trash and a cheap ripoff of the original coin. {BTC} and it wants to claim that it is the real Bitcoin. 
It is also backed/funded/shilled by Roger Ver supporters. If they developed their own Alt coin and not just ripped off the BTC code, then most of us would have been ok with it. 
The other partners in this endeavour is just as bad.

The Bitcoin in Bitcoin Cash is very important. The con will not work, if people take out the Bitcoin in the name. They need to stand out from the rest of the 1000s of Alt coins.
Bitcoin {the name} give them the edge over the competition.

He also gave most of those bitcoins to people, to encourage them to start using Bitcoin. {$1 here and there}
@_date: 2015-06-24 08:39:56
This is exacly my point. We have all these fancy tools to protect us, but a rogue agent or one of these companies who reverse engineered these hacks, might take control of these backdoors and tip the whole wagon. 
Being within the firmware, allows them to intercept any information, before it goes to the OS. 
They even have access to store data in areas where manufacturers only have access. 
Scary thought.... 
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:20:04
You think? We do not need the tax burden ;-&gt;
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:10:29
I agree, I am not really worried that they would target normal citizens BUT the methods they use, might end up in the wrong hands. 
On one of the Hack meetups, a hacker found the exploit they created for themselves, when he reverse engineered the hardware. {I think it was a hacker} 
So they create these backdoors and the wrong people end up using it for the wrong reasons. 
Jacob Applebaum also have direct access to ex-employees from the NSA, who turned whistleblower and they share these methods with the public. 
What then? 
@_date: 2015-06-24 08:26:16
They intercept the creation of the offline options and grab the private keys. 
When they need to use it, they just seize it, without you even knowing it was them. 
Most people would just think they were hacked.

Most other Alt coins is built on Satoshi Nakamoto's original Blockchain concept, and I never said Bitcoin will be the beginning and end of all Crypto Currencies. It is just the most popular, because it has the largest network at the moment. 
I own several Alt coins, but I think Bitcoin is still the original concept with the biggest potential. {Google : Lightning Network}
Bitcoin cannot use more "electricity" than fiat companies, if you calculate the whole "footprint" - {Electricity consumed in their offices/Card readers/Lifts/Lightning/Data warehouses &amp; servers/Air-conditioning etc etc.}

 **ETN** vs. **ETF**. ETNs are structured products that are issued as senior debt notes, while **ETFs** represent a stake **in an** underlying commodity.

Ignore the fools - It is common knowledge that spam attacks was rampant during those times. They are just shills, trying to badmouth Bitcoin. 
Since then SegWit was implemented and they knew it would be too expensive to continue the attacks, so they stopped.

Well, I am looking at traditional interest received over 30 years and what gain I received in 1 yr from Bitcoin. So if I invested the same amount into traditional investments, my gain in 1 year would have been MUCH higher over the next 30 years.

I think the stability thing, is a non issue these days. 
Earlier this year, before it dropped to the levels it is now, we saw a lot of volitilaty, but now it's levelling out around $400. 
This is being manipulated by all the exchanges, and for some it's the better option. 
I feel, we need a totally decentralized exchange, where no bots will survive, where the real market force, can do it's thing, based on real supply and demand. 
All the big players, do not even deal on the exchanges, due to strict regulatory constraints. 
Most big deals are done in private, away from any exchange.

If something was set on the blockchain side, preventing it from doing the transaction, it might work?
Before the transaction can occur, it has to check, if a previous transaction has been done. 
Some more work and fees for the miners.
It will also only be done, for people who choose to set that option. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 06:18:20
Point is, you would not need a Bitcoin ATM. 
You have a mobile phone, the merchant have a mobile phone, so you scan and go. 
If my online wallet is empty, I can phone someone at home or a friend, ask them to deposit some bitcoins into my bitcoin account, and I can pay for the service. 
People can Sms or email bitcoins to you.
So you not dependent on a Banks infrastructure to work, for you to access your money.

I think the fastest way to buy it, is if you can find a Bitcoin vending machine in your area. 
I did not have one, but I knew someone, who lived close to one. 
I send them a photo of my public address QR code, and I transfered the amount, from my bank to his. {via Online banking} 
He went there, scanned my QR photo, inserted the fiat money, and viola.. I got the Bitcoins. 
He lives 800 miles away from me, and I got my coins in minutes.

This will only be applicable to bitcoin addresses created for the purpose of daily use. To buy coffee and lunch etc. 
You can stiil have, your normal bitcoin addresses without this feature. 
It's like choosing to use a pass phrase or not, when you create the address.

You see day after day, how a bully beats up on other, and when the stronger guy comes around and bully them, you get that warm feeling, and even a lol out of it. 
Question is, is the bully beaten?

But, whilst they are down, they need to take the beating, they gave to hard working poor people, without a voice, around the world.

Yes, I like the concept, and also the Tax angle, what I do not like, is that it is still linked to fiat.

The "technical error" was linked to the local land line telecom service provider, not being able to provide the service for the ATM to work. {Power outage on a exchange}
The machine used to read the debit and credit cards, was also linked to the same data line {Adsl link} 
Bitcoin would still be able to function {Mobile to mobile phone transaction}

Well, if ALL transactions in BTC was reflected on the exchanges, we would have seen a far better picture of it's acctual value. 
There are loads of transactions being done privately and also between people on services like localbitcoin, which is not being taken into consideration, to determine the real value of the currency.

Hey thanks for the info...
Most interesting part was this " Because of these constraints, tipping over YouTube requires a $0.21 +5% fee, yet it’s becoming increasingly apparent that users are willing to tip less than minimum fees. If a million viewers wish to tip $0.01 but not more than $0.22 for a viral video, this revenue is lost for the content creator."
Changetip is MUCH better and you get 100% of the tips you receive. 
Why pay someone else, for content you created. They get revenue from the Ad's and that should be enough.

Market forces, is supposed to work like this:
1. Hoarders keep coins out of circulations and the less bitcoins there are to buy, the higher the price. 
2. On Black Friday, more people spend bitcoins at Merchants, who convert bitcoin to fiat on exchanges. 
3. These exchanges thus has a over supply of bitcoins, and the price goes down. 
Exchanges are manipulated {Bot trading etc...} 
You might see a lower price for a week, and then it will go back to the levels, they are now.

Merchants should offer more discounts on people using Bitcoin and you will see a massive increase in the demand for it. But merchants just climb in to get their portion of the hoarded coins, and then they drop it. They do not bring their part in this relationship. Discounts can only be on popular products too.

1. There is no need to re-fill with cash.
2. I can use my mobile phone {No ATM needed} or just scan a QR code from my wallet

Remember this will not be applicable to ALL bitcoin addresses. Only the ones, where you choose to use this feature. 
Most hacking occur on the wallet provider part. {Compromised passwords} 
If this can be set on the protocol, before you use the wallet, or when you create the wallet, it would provide for a added layer of protection.

You make a good point. So consumers demand lower prices, and they want those goods to be manufactured, in one of the countries, with the highest labor cost in the world? 
I thought, I read, somewhere that Walmart use a percentage of local suppliers, when they go into a area. {I wonder, how they will survive, if they only used local suppliers} In a global market they will fail within the first week. 
How many job opportunities do they create, when they go into a new area? 
When Sam Walton was in charge, the Global village was small. The world is changing.... Competition increase, and cost has to be cut, to survive. 
I still think, they can make a big impact.

Bitcoin - The Bank of the future! 
When you go to a bank today, your money is stored in a electronic ledger on their system. You do not have access to that ledger, because it's protected, and kept away from the public. 
Bitcoin saves it's ledger on millions of computers all over the world, and gives you FULL access to your part, with a private key.
Banks are compromised, because some corrupt employees have access to the FULL ledger.
Bitcoin allow EVERYONE to look at their ledger, called the Blockchain, but you are still the only person, who have access to your money. 
Even though, you can see the ledger, you still do not know, who the owners of the other Bitcoins are. 
You can open as many accounts {Bitcoin addresses} as you need, at NO cost. 
Enjoy the future of Banking!
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:35:34
Well, it's not easy to get it. 
If it was not for faucets, most people, like myself, would never have bitcoins. 
Where I live, Bitcoin ATM's or vending machines are many 100's of km/miles away. 
And we all know, money makes money.. and if you, do not have it, you have to work so much harder to get it. 
I can see a change, but it's happening VERY slowly. 
Owning a Bitcoin is difficult, owning a few Satoshi on the other hand, is much easier. 
Thanks for the video... VERY good.
@_date: 2014-12-24 08:44:38
This must be one of the best NEWS items, I have seen, since they adopted Bitcoin. 
That will encourage people to use Bitcoins.... not just accepting it as a merchant..
@_date: 2014-12-09 14:49:55
You have to reference it to something, people know.
It's still early days for Bitcoin. {How long has the dollar been around?} People know it, and accept it. 
People in other countries reference it to their currency e.g. Yen / Pounds etc. 
If things progress as it's doing now, people would soon, do the opposite. {Reference fiat to Bitcoin} 
Fiat had it's purpose, until we became a Global village, now it will become obsolete. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:54:07
Well, I hoped it would fail. The less bitcoins going directly to fiat, will be better for the price. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:56:52
Nope, it's not awesome, if you do it while you online. 
That is the fastest method to loose your coins. 
If you want to do it that way, go to that address... move cursor until you get the page. Save the whole page as a html document and unplug your internet access.. 
Then click on paper wallet and then click on generate until you find some addressess you like and print it. 
Doing it online, will be like switching on a light and attracting bitcoin moths {hackers} 
Hope that helped... not 100% secure method, but better than doing it online.

I tried to take part in most of the discussions, to keep it going, but I think, I was a little over optimistic, and have to tone it down a bit.

Bitcoin - Putting the power of money, back into your hands!
The moment you use your credit card on the internet, it's compromised and in the hands of a 3rd party.  
Bitcoin place the power back in your hands. Transactions done with Bitcoin, is directly between the buyer and seller. 
Your Bitcoins is not stored in a bank, it's like having the key to your own virtual piggy bank. You carry this virtual piggy bank, with you on your phone or a notebook or on a piece of paper. 
Bitcoin is flexible enough, to allow you to email or Sms money to someone else. 
In most countries, it has become too expensive to mint coins, with Bitcoins, it will cost you nothing.
Take back, the power of money, with Bitcoins!!!

KYC is a excuse to invade people's privacy, expose their spending habits and to control people. 
It's hidden behind reasons, like eg. prevention of identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing to scare people, into sacrificing their privacy.

It's a shame, they had such a noble and great business plan, and it gets spoiled by over regulation.

Well, I will take it a step further.
Let's say the latest Xbox is your top selling product. 
Offer that product for people paying with Bitcoins at 10% lower than your discount, which you are offering for bitcoin payment. 
This will be the thing drawing customers in, and most of these people, will buy more things, once they see, what discounts, they will get, from using bitcoins. 
You fund this, from the saving you get from less banking fees. 
You stop this or reduce this, until you increased adoption in your local area.

And it's obvious, you live in a town or a big city in a developed world. It's time for you to get out of the city, where there are no mall's and ATM's around every corner. 
People tend to look at their own scenario and forget that Bitcoin can make a difference in rural areas, where the daily conveniences are 1 or 2 ATM's per town. 
Bitcoin, puts the ATM in your hands. {Mobile phone}

Well, try to find a technology, that can stop manipulation on exchanges. 
Then get people to stop spending huge amounts of bitcoins at merchants, who convert directly back to fiat. 
Also get +/- 15% of the people buying in to gold investments, to rather invest in bitcoin. 
Do that and the price of bitcoin will sky rocket beyond believe.

A friend and I decided to create our own "Charity Faucet" for this idea I have --&gt; 
Short summary, if you lazy to read :
5% of each faucet payout, goes towards a charity. 
Some big faucets have 900 000 users registered. 
So this will make a HUGE difference, if we can pull it off.
We need you guys&amp;girls support. 
Please read more about it, and promote the idea, to faucet owners you know. 
Have a GREAT day!!

@_date: 2014-12-24 09:14:38
Well, this is what my goal is going to be with this project :
You have people using a faucet and for every payment done, from this faucet, 5% goes to charities, who accept Bitcoin donations. 
So people in need benefit twice :
1. From faucet payments {Hourly}
2. From the charities who gets 5% {After every month}
We aim to choose charities, who accept donations directly, to a Bitcoin address. {They will be verified first} to cut out the greedy middle men, taking their cut from the pie or eliminate scam sites.
If you want to support this, just drop us a post in the thread and we will get back to you.... 
It's not fair for companies like PayPal to take a share of the money donated to go to charities.

3. Will Bitcoin do better? {Fixed amount of bitcoins}

Get a whole forum to back you, to ask, and they will have no option to adopt it. 
Introduce them to services like BitPay. Most companies do not want to accept it, because they do not understand the technology and do not want to invest in something, with no gauranteed ROI. 
Send them as much information as possble, to make it easy for them to consider or accept it.

Create a online version, where people pay acctual Satoshi to play. All the Satoshi paid in at the start, will go to the bank. 
While you play, the Satoshi paid at the start, get's distributed amongst the players. 
Link each game to a faucet, that pays out, when you pass the Start. {Like in Monopoly}
Link each game to a timer. When the time runs out, each player receives, whatever he has at that time. 
If a players quit, before the time runs out, his Satoshi gets shared amongst the remaining players or it goes to the faucet. 
Whatever is paid, in the game "Chance / fees" etc.. help to fund the faucet. 
Banner Ad's on the border of the game, also help to fund the faucet, for each game. 
I would like to see, this game online. 
What a GREAT way to introduce people to Bitcoin. 
I would like to see, 4 people around a table at home, playing online Bitcoin Monopoly for real money, any day of the week.

Faucets, can be used for good, and be a little less of a waste for time, when you support this :
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:07:15
Thank you  - I will add it to the threads. 
Another cool take on this :
The faucet owner choose 2{two} charities and give the members a dropdown menu to choose which charity, they want to support. 
Then you have a battle, between, for example the group supporting Cancer and the group supporting the SPCA {Animals}
This will have several advantages for the faucet owners :
1. More people will visit their site, to support a charity. 
2. Less active users might, use the faucet more, and this will also increase traffic to the site.
3. It makes a faucet more fun, and worth doing.  
And we all know, more traffic to your site, bring more advertizers. 
The advantage for the members of the faucet :
1. More exposure mean, more refferals and more refferals, mean more income for the users
2. It makes it's easier to market a faucet to someone. {You tell them it's for charity, and they still get 95% of the payouts}

I guess the bigger warehouse mining operations, have done their calculations, and will pull out, once the 1 Bitcoin level per 10 minutes are reached. 
Transaction volumes will have to be 1 000 000 transactions every 10 minutes to make up for the reduced bitcoins, that are released. 
I think we are averaging 80 000 transactions now?
Will miners still be interrested to mine, if there are no incentive to do it?
Let's hope, the transactions increase to those levels, to sustain the miners rewards through miner fees.

If you are a pedophile and you use Bitcoin, you will be the pedophile going to jail. {Bitcoin is the worst method to try and hide your activities, because it's not truly anonymous}
If you use no mixers it's even easier to trace you with Bitcoin. {Mixers, make it a little bit harder, but it can still be done} 
Ask that person, who said that, to tell you, how many pedophile transactions are being done daily, on the internet with fake or stolen credit cards. 
They just looking for ways, to taint Bitcoin.

Who on earth, keeps 160 BTC / 450 BTC / 1543 BTC on a online wallet? 
How many of these are shill posts, from competing wallet providers? 
If you value, your coins, keep it offline. When you have to use it, bring them online, on 5 to 10 online service providers. 
Spread the risk, or the time, people have access to them. 
I will NEVER keep so much BTC on a online wallet. Most I will have online, will be enough for a cup of coffee. 
When you want to buy something big, go online and sweep it from cold storage and spend it, at the same time. 
Do not leave it, online.

We all make mistakes. I tipped people text for a long time, until I noticed my mistake. 
I felt like a fool, and rectified my mistake.

Bigger tips draw more attention, so keep it real. 
Very valid post, thanks for sharing.

That is the GREAT thing about faucets. People who has nothing can generate income. 
When I started with Bitcoins, I had no way to buy it. No local ATM's / Vending machines and I turned to experiment with FAUCETS. 
This paid off, because I used that coins to buy into cloud mining and that generated more passive daily income. 
So for many people, this is the only way to start. 
If we can get more NEW people to see that, and link it to charity, WE have a winning combination.

Money transfer around the world is expensive. We have seen the WU feeble attempt at pushing it's money transfer for premium fees. 
Bitcoin is idealy suited for micro transactions, because of the extremly low fees. 
Use any other option and compare their price, you will not find it cheaper. 
It's also convenient, because it's fast. {Services like ChangeTip has made it even faster} 
I cannot say, Changetip will be the driver of quality content creation, because a lot of people, will post anything, in the hope of getting anything. 
What it will do, is stimulating more frequent content. {You post a question, and you get 3 to 4 posts, within a short period} 
People will also be more polite. {Well most of them} ;-&gt;
Changetip is fast, and no login to a 3rd party is required. {It's built into the APP you use .. Twitter/Reddit etc}
Hope this helps.  
@_date: 2014-11-22 19:21:19
People are very generous, I am actually amazed by how friendly and good people can be. 
I have been on other forums, and it's hectic on some of them. {Flaming, people spamming and screaming at each other}
I think ChangeTip could help bring some order and patience, because some people, will behave themselves, when they think, they might get tipped.
It makes me warm inside, when people do good to each other. 
We live in a world, where things become nasty VERY quickly. 
Please keep up the good spirit of tipping, and spread the joy!

Great Deal, but I still cannot afford it. 
$119 for people in most countries, are a lot of money. 
I have to use a offline paper wallet, for the little bit of Satoshi's I have. 
The rest, is on a online wallet, but it's only enough, to buy a few cups of coffee. 
I split small amounts onto many paper wallets, to distribute the risk. {Lowest per paper wallet = 0.1 BTC}
It's a schlep to sweep, but it reduce the risk, of losing everything, in one go.
I see too many people, complaining about losing BIG amounts. 
A TREZOR will be a great buy, and a lot easier, but I simply cannot afford that price tag.

You buy and wait for the right time to sell.

Create a Blockchain.info web wallet and email it to them from there.

Do not believe everything you read. Many Shill and Trolls doing the rounds, to discredit Blockchain.info or Bitcoin. 
Some are paid to do it. 
Image this : You create a kickass new wallet, but people need to know about it. 
You can either pay for massive advertizing for your product or pay some people to discredit your competition. 
Check some of the posts of these people, talking trash of bitcoin. {80% or more of the posts, consist of trolling or shilling} Ask yourself this question... Why create an account on reddit, to do only that? 
Best is to ignore them.

Yes it was, but let's say someone comes up with a similar project with some accredited manner to validate the person, who would become a millionaire, it would be impossible.  
It would take 40 000 days to tip someone to become a millionaire.

It kills the principle of this.

Let's not for one second forget, how many people are buying bitcoins with credit cards now. {So they still getting income from the bitcoin market}
They fight for regulation, but the internet are full of sites, where you can buy fake credit/debit cards. 
They should visit some of the bitcoin exchanges, and see how much information is asked, if you want to buy and sell through them. 
When they have nothing more to say, they always fall back to MtGox. Lots of things changed after that, but it's still a nice punchbag for bitcoin haters!

I have been asking the same things for months now. 
The centralized exchanges are a breeding ground for thievery and manipulation of the currency. 
It's a playground for botting and it's more disruptive for the progress, than adding value to the community. 
How can we say, we have a true reflection of Bitcoin or any other crypto currencies value, if MOST of the transactions occur between private individuals, and have no bearing on the price. 
$200 000 is a huge loss! I can feel your pain, through the screen, when I read that, and I am amazed by your positive outlook on the future. 
I would not have been able to take a knock like that, because I have nowhere near, that kind of money. 
We all make mistakes, and some people learn from that, and come through as winners, but some, just give up. 
I can see, you are looking up at the sky, and you saw the light..... A winner is born!!!!

Mpesa runs on mobile phones, controlled by mobile operarators with centralized control.

You cannot, just run into this, as if you are a ponzi marketer, trying to sell off a new HYIP scheme. 
The mind is open, when the wine and beer is flowing! 
Also try to relate it, with what people like to do. {More people play games, like Angry Birds etc, than what they willing to admit} Get one of these games, accepting Bitcoin, and spread the joy.

I think, that is the problem, with most of the people commenting on threads on forums. 
They come from a 1st world country or town, and they cannot see the huge potential this currency are bringing to the 3rd world. 
You do not need huge infrastructure investments for bitcoin to work. 
Most of them have mobile phones or internet caffee's 
You can send bitcoin or a tip to some of the poorest people on this earth, even if they shared a phone, between a whole family. 
If the local merchant have a mobile phone and a wallet, they can pay for goods and service with the phones.
Transaction fees are a non-issue with bitcoins. 
Most African countries, like Kenya have been using a similar "digital" BUT centralized alternative, called Mpesa.  
{Lots of people are educated, but poor, due to high unemployment in their country} 
Services they can render : 
Translation into native languages 
Typing

Update : We have started with the faucet, and it has been full of challenges, but we getting there. 
Some of the challenges :
1. Finding legitimate charities using Bitcoins
2. Sorting scam from real 
3. Building in methods to prevent multiple payouts to the same user.
4. Closing holes for hacking exploits
5. Choosing the correct Ad services 
6. Deciding on ref system 
7. Wallet system or direct deposits for members
8. Setting up secure multi sig wallet for charity payouts 
And it goes on and on... It's a lot more complex, than what we thought, when we started this. 
If we do it properly, it will take off and fly ;-&gt;

The value of bitcoin are determined by the demand. If nobody used the US $ it would not have been the de facto fiat currency.

Yes, there will be people, who would try to cheat. 
For that reason, I suggested people should add a link to the site, they would be supporting, and the bitcoin address, MUST be posted on that site in public.

Mark Karpelles, went to learn something from Nikos Karvelas. {Famous Greek songwriter, producer, and singer}
He came back home, and was asked : What did you learn?

I agree 100% with him. You sacrifice your freedom, for other people to govern your live. 
They should not ban something, to make their work easier. Law enforcement, should step up and find innovative ways to intercept communication, and foil terrorism that way.

Late for the party, but want to ask, for funding to get this "Charity" faucet going. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 08:56:16
The sun set on a busy New York day, as Satoshi sat staring at the screen in his one bedroom apartment. 
He was still worked up, from the 3 hours he had to spend at the bank, trying to sort out a problem, caused by the bank. 
The question popped up in his head, as bright as a setting sun in the horizon, "How can I improve this age old banking system?" 
The question stay with him, and every day, he ponder over this conundrum. 
One morning, he woke to the screaming voice of a baby, somewhere in the building and the even louder screaming of the parents.
The women was saying ....."Goldman did what?" ...."Now they sack you, for their mistakes?" 
The man was quite and you could just hear the fear in his silence. 
This sets a trigger in his brain, that would be a start to a thing called, BitCoin.
In the following weeks the Banking sector nearly crippled the world economy and the governments of the world colluded to safe them with tax payers money. 
Satoshi worked day and night, to stop this from ever happening again, but little did he know, this would be the start of something, that would force him, to go in hiding. 
In the months to come, he worked his magic with math and cryptography and created a protocol, solving many of these problems. 
This technology helped other people, but it had it's victims and he was one of them.

You highlight one event {MtGox} and they where used by people around the world and I quoted only stats for Australia for 2014 -- Go to the same website and see the statistics for the other years, prior to 2014. 
MtGox is not the Bitcoin protocol, it was simply a service, used to steal money/BTC. 
Debit/Credit cards and Cheques and even fiat are being counterfeited and that is a example of a currency failing. The Bitcoin protocol is not creating "fake" bitcoin from thin air... It's running as solid as a rock. 
It's the corrupt services based on Bitcoin, that is being used for fraud.

We have heard of these faucets before, they pay "The highest" payout for a week, and then, they stop paying or they are forced to pay much less. 
Forcing people to use Xapo wallet, are also not a good route to follow, to get the maximum expose to ALL faucet users. 
Give the people a alternative, like Freebitcoin and Bitcoinzebra. 
That is a NO for me.  
@_date: 2015-01-24 06:59:17
We are in the process to finalize a faucet, that would do the normal payouts, to poor people who use it and a portion of that goes to charities. 
So if a person use the faucet, they would for example get 1000 Satoshi per hour, but 5% will automatically be subtracted to go to a charity. 
The site will choose different charities, depending on the need or recommendations/votes of the people using the faucet. 
We need initial funding to make the faucet attractive for a wider audience. {If we start with a low payout, less people will use it}
So the more donations we get, the higher we can make the payout at the start. 
After the ad's on the page, starts to pay out, it will fund the future payouts on it's own. 
Let me know, if you are interested to help out.  
Have a great day, and thank you for asking.

How, I read this : 
1. He says it's a good concept
2. More people will accept it, if it's less anonymous.
3. People do not like it, if it's used to fund terrorism. 
4. If Bitcoin do not adhere to what people want, they will develop a coin, that does, and use that. 
So in my opinion, they will develop a NEW more transparent Coin, based on the Bitcoin concept. 
Until then, they will milk Bitcoin and convert everything they get, back into fiat. 
Bitcoin has the advantage of a already established merchant network, but they can easily swap to a new currency, based on the Bitcoin protocol.

Supply and demand :
If there are a bigger supply, than there are a demand for, the price will go down. 
If there is a low supply {people hoarding} it becomes scarse and the price goes up. 
Before all these HUGE merchants like Dell / Microsoft etc joined, people hoarded their coins and the price went up. 
The BIG merchants started to accept Bitcoins as a payment option, and most of these hoarders and other people started buying goods from them. 
The NEW merchants did not keep the coins, because they had to pay expenses in fiat, so they converted most of these coins back into fiat. 
This is creating a over supply on the exchanges and it in turn push the price down. 
There are more coins in circulation {on exchanges} than there were previously.... So the price goes down accordingly. 
When NEW people, like you, start buying coins, the price will go up... If you use those coins at one of these merchants, who converts directly back to fiat, it will cancel that price increase. 
If you buy those coins as a investment and you keep it out of circulation, you increase their value. 
It's like any other commodity... Take gold for instance.. If they find a new source of gold tommorow and/or they find a cheap way to get it, the price will go down, because that gold will flood the market.   
To make things worst, miners dump new coins onto the market daily, because they need the fiat money to pay for electricity etc.. etc.. Those coins create a over supply and the price goes down. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:31:03
I 100% agree with you, and have been saying this on other platforms too...
Everyone, including myself, rave when HUGE organizations/merchants accept Bitcoins, but that actually hurt the price of the currency.
I think Overstock is one of the only companies, who actually invest, back into the currency with NEW and innovative ways to improve it. {Paying salaries in Bitcoin etc etc}
Yes, as a merchant, you still have to pay bills in fiat, but I would recommend, saving some Bitcoins for a rainy day. 
Leave some of the spare income in Bitcoin savings and use Bitcoin as payment to other suppliers or merchants, to keep it in circulation. 
The coins you save today, might double in value tomorrow!

@_date: 2015-01-11 18:15:46
My guess - During 2014 we have seen huge merchant adoption from many big companies. 
These companies tend to convert all bitcoins received as payment, directly back to fiat. 
The increase in BTC converted back to fiat on exchanges, lead to a over supply of coins on exchanges, where the price is determined on supply and demand. 
So you have more people selling BTC than people buying it and that force the price down. 
To top that, these exchanges are manipulating the price and bots are creating havoc. 
The Bitcoin price will increase, when there is a bigger demand for it. 
So Bitcoin adoption and hoarding is key to increase the price. 
Over time, more people will see it's value and the free market will restore it's value. 
Bitcoin is no different to any other commodity, when it comes to supply and demand.

I sometimes wonder if Bitcoin Core suggested a "clean" Block size upgrade, without SegWit or LN, if these BU supporters would have changed their mind OR if all of this is just a power play to get Gavin back behind the wheel? 
It is clear that the people behind BU is banking on miners fear of losing miners fee's and if this is the case, then they should simply put something on the table that would satisfy the miners and see what happens after that. 
I bet ya, they will not go for that, because it's a political show now, and not about the code.

I am glad the SEC disapproved this application. Why do we need more Wall Street whales buying all the bitcoins? They do not have the passion or the vision for a ground breaking technology like this. 
Let them play with their Monopoly "shares" and manipulate their markets with their money bags. 
They created a "exclusive" club for the rich boys, where 
brokers do the dirty work and they make the profits. 
We will see who will have the last laugh, when Fiat goes down.

Kids, I think you have to consider, if this guy was smoking his socks, when he was in the class... He is still a bit out of it.. long term affect, kicking in now. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:16:32
Hold your $20 until there is a dip in the price and then buy when it is cheaper. Sell when it is high and keep the profits. 
This will reduce your risk of losing everything, if something goes wrong.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:06:54
The Gold cartel manipulate that too. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:42:42
A investor with no knowledge about Bitcoin, should welcome this "regulated" strategy to invest in this technology. Most of the threats are being managed by the ETF for them. 
This is a much better way for them to be protected from the hackers and thief lying in wait for them, if they have done this in the normal "unregulated" ways.  
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:16:01
The BitLicence was the first step, and the ETF the second. 
We will see lots of these decisions in the future. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:57:57
Needed :
Antminer S9's @ $ 2100 US x 240 000 = $ 504 000 000 
Problem is nobody would sell it to you, because they will not relingish the power they have over Crypto currencies. 
Solution = Local development &amp; manufacturing to break their monopoly.  
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:47:18
The speculators and manipulative brokers would have destroyed Bitcoin for profits. 
We should celebrate the fact that these sharks were stopped now.
We will soon see a Killer App and then they will beg us to get in. 
Here comes the cheap coins... my precious!!!!

@_date: 2015-05-22 09:46:38
Nope.. Still prohibitively expensive compared to Bitcoin, and not suitable for small amounts. 
They flash the P2P label, but it's a feeble attempt to mimic Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-03 08:43:32
This is the way, I am seeing this. Let's say your debt is $2000 a month. If you pay off your debt, you eliminate all the interest on those loans. 
You are also used to paying $2000 p/m for the debt, so you might buy $2000 worth of bitcoins for the remainder of the loan period, to get back some of those bitcoins. 
You will have cash on hand to buy bitcoins and you will have no debt and you will score all that interest on that loan.

Nooot, I will make it easier for you... " Electricity systems are quite complicated, mainly because electricity cannot be stored, except in small quantities. So, you have the concept of pools, grid operator despatch functions, etc. Hydro power is mainly located in mountains, a long way from population centers. The transmission line losses often make it unfeasible to transport the electricity supply to where it is demanded; consequently, a lot of hydro power is underutilized. "

It is not Bitcoin's fault.... It is the damn KYC/AML regulations these 3rd party services has to adhere to. 
One day, we will not have to rely on them. 
Once that is done, it will go faster.

This whole developer fight remind me of two kids fighting over one ice cream. Before the fight was over, the ice cream was melted. Same thing is going to happen with Bitcoin, if they go on like this.

Like they said, most of these are under 18's who cannot use credit cards or other payment methods, but have the pocket money to spend on skins. 
The "No Chargeback" option for them, is also a better solution to keep their money safe. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 08:34:12
Yea, this is why they might be considering to accept it directly. Other services are hijacking their potential profits. ;-&gt;
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:38:17
Do they accept ZERO confirmations? That was pretty fast. Just imagine how cool that would be with LN.

The debt that our kids will have to pay, generations from now. 
Hitler sidestepped the bankers by creating his own money, like Satoshi Nakamoto did with Bitcoin. :-&gt; 
In Billions for the Bankers, Debts for the People (1984), Sheldon Emry commented: 
"Germany issued debt-free and interest-free money from 1935 on, which accounts for 
Germany's startling rise from the depression to a world power in five years. The German 
government financed its entire operations from 1935 to 1945 without gold, and without 
debt. It took the entire Capitalist and Communist world to destroy the German revolution, 
and bring Europe back under the heel of the Bankers."

The world will shake their heads when that government allows genocide in that country.

Well, I would obviously hate a scenario where Bitcoin cannot provide a alternative for the "small" guys to the offerings that are forced onto people by the rich and powerful elites. 
I still believe this technology gives people a choice and it can disrupt monopolies, if they can get pass the government protection that are provided for these elites.

The long-term investors has no lost a cent. The speculators will lose money, because they panic too quickly and sell at a loss. I have gone though MANY mini dumps and always made a profit. 
Do not panic and ignore the people pointing fingers from the side line. Any trade comes with risks. 
Gold and other commodities goes through the same motions. { Cartels manipulating the price and people hyping and shilling to boost the price }

A friend of mine took some money from his bond account and bought some bitcoins. He sold it 2 days after that and made a $1030 US profit on those coins. 
He risked nothing, because he configured the bot to sell at a price higher than the buying price. The price was spiking, so he configured a upper threshold and sold when it reached his price.

Wall Street banksters received big bonuses for packaging up mortgages they knew would not be repaid into securities that they could sell to investors for big fees.

I know a lot of people who owns a lot of bitcoins and that is their private financial information, not the banks or the corrupt employees working there or even in the law enforcement agencies. {Like we saw with the Silkroad agents, who stole the coins in the raid} 
The people who are being taken for a ride is the people that are too blind to see the signs. {cook a frog slowly, they will only realize it, when they die} &lt;--- Similar to the Fiat banking system.

The long-term investors has no lost a cent. The speculators will lose money, because they panic too quickly and sell at a loss. I have gone though MANY mini dumps and always made a profit.

The USA is a very frustrating place for Bitcoiners, with all the government regulations hampering progress. {KYC &amp; AML regulations} 
Once you start trading with people via LocalBitcoin and you setup a good "trust" relationship.. it becomes much easier, and some start to give discounts to regular customers, below the premium. ;-&gt; 
I sell some of my own coins at a premium to friends, who are too lazy to jump through the hoops and I use that to cover my extra fees. 
You have to be creative... ;-&gt;

I have been asking for this, for quite some time on all platforms.... and Overstock can see the vision of this option. 
Take one of your bestsellers e.g. Xbox.. sell it for less than the competitors and only make the offer applicable when they pay with BTC and you will gain much more adoption. 
Do not sit back, and expect people to adopt Bitcoin by themselves.. there has to be a push incentive for them to do it. 
Fund this, with the lower transaction fees, until you feel you have reached enough people, and then gain the profits. 
Exellent move... Congrats on their vision...

They have the right recipe for success... All merchants should follow their example. 
Accept BTC and promote it with discounts in the beginning to get it off the ground.

When I think of Roger Ver, I think about the scorpion in this story : 
 A scorpion enlists a frog to take him on his back across a stream, even  though the frog is astute enough to protest that the scorpion "will  surely sting me and I will die." The scorpion points out that if he  stings the frog, he will die too. The trusting frog thus takes on his  passenger, is stung by him, and the two creatures drown together. But  before the frog drowns he asks, "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion,  even though it costs us both our lives?" to which the Scorpion replies,  acceptingly, "It is my [nature](

Ok, the new strategy is : 
If we cannot take over Bitcoin, then we will run our Alt coin on top of it as a add-on token. 
We will run this on several Blockchains, so if we are kicked off from one, it will still run on others. 
We will be part of Bitcoin, like a Remora fish will feed off a shark. {Also called a suckerfish}

The funding would only be a problem at the start.. to get things going until we reach that break even point you are talking about... carrying the faucet with our own money, until the advertisement income can cover the cost.

It gives you the same functionality, than you getting, when you use cash. {fiat} 
When you use your coins, it can be tracked on the blockchain. 
THEY use sites like this --&gt; 
Nobody tracks your cash transactions on a daily basis. 
Companies can however follow your buying trends, if they get hold of your credit/debit cards. 
So with a mixer service, it scramble the source coins, to make it harder to trace your spending habits.

@_date: 2015-02-24 12:11:42
Well, I am determined to make a difference.... I want to create a faucet, that pay a % of it's payout to charity. 
I have started with others to make this a reality, but I doubt, if we will be able to fund it enough to grow really big. 
I suggested this to the owners of freebitcoin and they implemented it. {It has already paid to charity and it's still going... so I am glad it's working}
If I had 1000 BTC .. I would put a big % of that into funding for the faucet, and creating something, that would really benefit charities. {The rest will be hoarded, until the price is doubled or trippled... to pay the bond/car/debt}
You can go here, if you want to know more, or if you want to help ---&gt; 
This is one of my bucket list items.. so I just have to do it. ;-&gt;
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:42:41
Merchants &amp; Users will go the one way and miners the other. Who wins in the end? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:56:56
We do not want to save remitters ANY money. There should be no need for them, if people could buy/pay for the basic things in BTC. 
Everyone is saying, "We want to help the poor" but in reality, we are keeping them poor, when we charge them for services. 
If companies are really serious about helping the poor, they would have exempted the lower bracket of the remittance market, from ALL fees. 
Example : $1 to $2000 {in value} = 0 Fees per month 
               ........$2000+ = {set fee}
This makes me think of a joke, I heard from a street vendor : 
"" Question - How do you keep a poor man, from drowning? ""
    Answer - "Take your foot off his head"
And that is, what some of these companies are doing... They lift their feet, just enough, to keep the poor alive and kicking, to have them come back for more. 
We live in a sad world!

@_date: 2015-02-02 08:53:18
The question is.... Why do we need to create another WD / MoneyGram etc etc... ?
If you can keep BTC from being converted back to fiat, you would not have the need for them. 
I would say, rather increase merchant adoption in the areas where people use the currency the most, and avoid convertion of BTC to fiat in full. 
The basic things like electricity bills / groceries etc etc. 
When people can buy and pay for these things in BTC, they will not need services like these.

Yep spot on... your landlord will not accept BTC but you want to pay him in BTC.. so you go to them with your BTC and they pay your landlord in the currency he/she wants. 
Good for people, who receive BTC as payment from family working in another country and then having their people not being able to use it or sell it to pay for something. 
For a fee, they will get fiat payments.

Ok, so let's take an example quickly : 
You bought 360 coins a few years ago at $100 per coin and it cost you $36 000. Those coins at $2750 would be worth $1 000 000 today.
Ok, Let's say you have to pay 50% capital gains {which would be crazy, but still... } then you will be left with $500 000 - $36 000 = $ 464 000. {Math calculations totally wrong, but simplified to make a point} 
I would take the $ 464 000 profit and be happy that I made the best investment ever... and sleep without worries that the feds will burst through the door to arrest me for tax evasion. 
{over simplified, to make my point} Do not be greedy, pay the tax and sleep like a baby.

Your bank balance is a digital entry on a centralized ledger/database. Every transaction on the internet is digital. 
Bitcoin is not stored on a central database, which is controlled by banks. 
YOU are in control of your wealth, even if you cannot touch it, you can still transfer it to someone as payment for their goods and services.
