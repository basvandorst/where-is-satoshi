He's thanking us for our corporation, which is nice, but in the end, really means nothing.

KeePass can work the exact same way on an iPhone/iPad/Mac. They're both good products.

Looks like a database issue according to their Twitter account -

I wouldn't be too confused, but get your own legal advice. It seems pretty clear from past practice that you do not need to be licensed and registered as a money services transmitter to sell smaller amounts of bitcoin in Canada. Although in my opinion, if anyone is thinking of doing something like this, they should attempt to implement and follow the FinTRAC guidelines as it will definitely go a long way when you do get audited, which you will, because the government is going to dig deep for criminal activity of either the people using the services, or the people running the services. But there is no statement from FinTRAC, or any other reliable source that I can find, which states that people running a bitcoin vending machine need to register and get licensed as a money transmitter.

I think it's great that our userbase is becoming less informed over time. It's bound to go that way if adoption continues and hopefully Bitcoin and the apps based on it start becoming easy enough for even more uninformed people to pick up and start using it. Similar to fiat. It's filled with completely uninformed people using it all over the place. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:09:50
Where are you getting this information from? If FinTRAC changed course on their guidance, it would be posted. Do you have an email you can share?
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:39:58
That's awesome! Your work as an ATM operator is valuable within this community and I wish you much success in your continued operations.

There is some room to move outside of being established enough to hire a developer outright and the constraints of a fresh startup with a small budget that doesn't include development. For instance, I took out a developer I know on Friday night and went over Bitcoin with him (it was interesting - he started out saying that it was a scam, and by the end of the night he was cooking up a bunch of possibilities, although he did end off by saying he didn't think he had the cycles to pull anything extra off because of a parent who is terminally ill). I can't offer a developer straight up cash or BTC, but I can offer company shares which gives incentive to people.

Well, I am pulling for you and hope everything gets resolved. I had no idea that Lamassu machines are tied down to Blockchain.info and only them.

What are the rates going to be? Are you working with the SEC in Quebec? Are you compliant with FinTRAC?

Occupy Wall Street was a waste of time and really became a demonstration of, in my opinion, lazy people and squatters. No one will ever take that seriously, just like the comments this person is ignorantly stating.
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:42:23
If they can't handle the traffic/infrastructure/security and there are better alternatives, then I hope the market reflects that. I personally like their business model, but if it doesn't work out in a practical sense, then hopefully market forces iron things out (and sooner rather than later).
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:25:16
Not bad for a company that has a market valuation of ~260 million dollars.
Also, and it may be related somehow, but I do believe Coastal supplies Overstock with their glasses.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:04:34
Great to see them expand their current service offerings. This is a pretty awesome addition (would like to see it in action first before final judgement though).
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:27:54
Of course it does, that goes without saying. But Blockchain isn't responsible for this particular ATM business, or at least that hasn't been indicated at all. If they don't have a contract for whatever uptime, then this users potential failure tomorrow is by no means Blockchain.info's fault. Each business will suffer the consequence of their actions, but they're exclusive to each business in this example.
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:17:58
As a business owner it's your responsibility to have a backup plan. Your business depends on it.

Probably pent up anger from that face of hers.

What's the wallet? Is this just for you or something that people in the Bitcoin community can use?
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:56:01
They keep on trying, but for some reason it just seems impervious to their previously powerful media smear campaigns. You have to give credit to the reporter for being fair and balanced on this one.
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:30:43
That really sucks. What is the model of ATM if you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:52:48
Do you have a source? I have looked into this as well in Canada and it doesn't appear as though you need to register as a money services business. I believe CaVirtex states as well that they aren't regulated by FinTRAC, but follow the rules out of caution (and I imagine anticipation of becoming regulated in the future). 
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:47:43
That's awesome mike_enriquez! Alternatives are great. Thanks so much for sharing!

For me it works like this:
No one forced this gentleman into an interview, you are correct. I would however suggest that Mr. Nakamoto was not able to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation because of both the amounts of money involved, and the general passion of Bitcoin enthusiasts. He wasn't forced, but I have doubt he could anticipate the impact. As far as calling the police, perhaps he felt stalked or something similar in nature. He didn't call the police on the other reporters from what I know.
There is a bit of irony of giving him money for the fact that he may be a target of having large amounts of money, but people inherently understand the difference between 10's or 100's of thousands of dollars of being prepared for delivery and handover compared to 100's of millions or possibly a billion dollars being available from someone possibly defenceless and unaware. 
I donated some Satoshis to Dorian because I want to show support for someone who either helped our community or was otherwise affected by it, to show that the bitcoin community is more than paying for drugs or laundering money to the world in general, and to just feel good in general, which may be selfish in nature, but that is something I can easily live with.
You make good points. Some people have different points of view and some more rational than others for sure.

What are the chances they kept information regarding the lost/missing bitcoins on Mega servers? This seems to be just before the mega raids.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:30:59
$50,000 is indeed a lot of money, but it is also an amount that is fairly easy to hide, and in the case of medical bills or security bills, or both, it is also an amount that can be spent pretty quickly. There are probably a lot of opportunities to try to fairly easily steal $50,000 out there, but it's probably generally not worth the risk for most people to take. Things become enormously different with a billion dollars at stake, especially in situations of possible lower security. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:16:36
Good to know! Thanks for providing that additional information to your potential customers. I am on the west coast, but should I get around to Montreal I will be certain to check you guys out! Good luck and thanks for contributing to the overall Bitcoin community.

I did a steg-out on it and nothing seemed to come up
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:49:38
Looks like it's fixed now. On the bright side, at least your launch wasn't today. It seems really unfortunate that you are forced to use Blockchain.info as a wallet for the machine. Anyway, good luck at the launch and let us know how it goes (that's great news!).
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:34:04
That's your opinion, and it's possible you may be right, but it seems to be much more effective at this point in the game of turning the heads of Wall Street and regulators than the laughable Occupy Wall Street 'Movement".

I am not saying they are exactly centralizing anything, but I am saying I think it's an elephant in the room that needs discussion. They may be planning on giving everyone pink candy popcorn, but if history is any predictor, I would suggest that someone, somewhere would try to centralize power and influence when it comes to Bitcoin. People with large sums of money (or currency of many types) often have their voices heard more so than people with little or no currency. This influence can then be used to work with lawmakers, media heads and personalities (my guess is they want to interview someone known, and it's hard to get interviews when the person doing the interviews is critical and/or open about the subject). My fear is that instead of having a government controlled fiat, we have a consortium controlled crypto currency. I don't see any appreciable difference in the end.
If you think that because Bitcoin is open source and developers can see and modify code and that is all there is to how Bitcoin works between the concept and the end-user, then I don't think there is anything more I can say other than that I respect your opinion.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:50:28
By the way, I agree with you, but I think there is more than what you point out (or sooner or later a group of people is going to try to come along and add another layer of influence).
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:51:39
It takes a lot more for Bitcoin to work than just software development, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:13:36
So then we should allow a group of people to centralize? I don't see how this relates.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:30:18
I wonder if the openness of the Bitcoin platform is being overshadowed by relatively few large holders of bitcoin. I feel like Bitcoin is closed almost because of this fact. You can have an open protocol all you like, but if early heavy players are setting secretive meetings and plotting the course of this open protocol, then I am not sure it falls into the category that Andreas calls 'open'. The protocol is open, however there's an elephant in the room, and it's a nearly centralized body of heavy early adopters trying hard to be a centralized lightning rod.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:45:13
The other thing they can control is perception to a certain degree, which is arguably one of the most powerful aspects of their centralization. This is the realm of politics and no one there gives things away without something in return.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:00:39
Influence.
