I see, so the Blockchain is capable of transactions with multiple inputs? This would be accomplished by the wallet software sending multiple input addresses at the time of the transaction, correct?

What happened in a nutshell:
Somebody sold a crap ton on Gox which caused other exchanges like BitStamp and BTChina to start to drop. 
Luckily BTCChina dropped below 1200 CNY for under 5 minutes before it instantly sprung back up. After seeing this Gox's users started to buy back and Gox's price started to rise. It is currently above 215 :)
Pretty much all of this was caused by a massive sell off on Gox.

I'll be concerned when the China exchanges start to drop, btcchina is holding above 1200 CNY. This should bounce back quickly.

Yeah also refreshing the market page shows the latest price without updating the market book or graph. However I can't imagine that's helping their servers very much so bitcoinity is what I'm running on right now.

Yeah it showed up almost instantly. I just searched my receiving address and it came right up.

You can use debit cards with moneygram and then use moneygram to purchase through localbitcoins, the fee is pretty steep (20 dollars) but if you have no other option this should work.

I just pulled mine out and it's 2/6 confirmations to my wallet already.

They trusted Square when it was starting up but not Coinbase? Coinbase makes you link bank accounts and even verify identity for level 2 transactions, at the very least just mandate that anyone using the App is L2 verified and this problem is solved.

For a site that handles that amount of transactions Mt. Gox does, I cannot believe how terrible they are -.-

Yes it's stuck at transactions around 103 for some reason.
