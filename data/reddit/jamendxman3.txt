Miners can include whichever transactions they want in the next block (They will prioritize the highest fee transactions), the fees are not set by the protocol. 
A) Charging higher fees for addresses performing a large number of transactions is just a form of censorship. The number of transactions an address makes shouldn't matter, they have to pay fees to make transactions anyways, and there is absolutely nothing stopping that person from just storing bitcoin in and transacting from multiple addresses (millions of addresses if they felt like it).
B) Once the transactions are signed with the private key, they cannot be modified, meaning they would not be able to be batched unless the person making the transaction is batching them, which is just something they'd need to decide to do in the first place.

It is only a gamble if you are the average buyer and have no clue how the thing you are buying works.

One of the protocol rules is that you need to know which value's hash is lower than the target, so if you were able to figure that out, you'd just be be following the protocol rules.

I mean IF you have access. If you still have the Electrum wallet file, or wrote down a recovery phrase somewhere, you can use that to open up the wallet, and then export the private keys for use in a BCH wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:40:51
There is no point in checking if an address already exists. The odds of generating an address that is in use with secure random number generation make the worry completely irrelevant.

I have a few family members who have put a little bit of money into Bitcoin, and the only thing they are going to hear from me when I am blamed after it crashes is "it is an investment, it isn't doing well, get over it".
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:54
If the fork occured while your coins were in your Electrum wallet, you'll need to have access to the private keys of that BTC address, and then you'll be able to import the private keys into a BCH wallet and transfer them.

My phone had the same thing earlier today, I figured maybe it just loaded the thumbnails in the wrong order.

Isn't alt-coin discussion against the rules?

Nobody can, it is pure speculation.

I already made the mistake of dumping Bitcoin @ $300 and Ethereum @ $12, don't think I'll make that mistake again.

Where did you validate it from? The checksum could have been changed on the site itself.

I am two of those forks. What's your point?

I sold some of my Ubiq and bought some more unspeakable yesterday.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:43:19
Bought some more yesterday, just waiting for the wallet to come out of maintenance so I can withdraw it. Once the price doubles, I think I'll cash in.

Not to deny the existence of vote manipulation, but sometimes when real people get called fake accounts, and entire communities are discredited, they are sure to use their Reddit voting power. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:56:25
Of-course they reserve the right to check your devices, entering into a country is a privilege.

I made a Facebook account so I could go onto Bloomberg, CNBC, and other articles mentioning Bitcoin and explain to people why Bitcoin was not a scam in the comments whenever someone would say it is. A day or two later, Facebook banned my account for seemingly no reason. Made another account, they banned that one a few days later.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:02:33
Which centralized group gets to decide what 'Bitcoin' actually is? Can no hard fork upgrade of Bitcoin ever occur with the forked version still being referred to as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:19:57
In the case of something like a trademark on a name, there is no way to observe accurate consensus among real people, in a decentralized network. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:52:12
There is no way to determine majority support though, and even then, just because the majority agrees on something, doesn't make it acceptable, so that is flawed logic. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:06:58
My question still stands. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:01:55
Bitcoin does not provide interest or returns, you are getting what someone else offers in a free market system, and Bitconnect having its own blockchain means nothing.

"Take 5 minutes from your time, install this app and give it a downvote." Vote manipulation?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:13:43
But could it really be argued that one chain is not Bitcoin in a decentralized environment? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:11:12
Your transactions could be blocked the same way any other content is (Though there would be ways around that), but not modified. After a transaction is signed, the only way to modify it would be to verify it with the public key, modify it, and sign it again. The last step can only be performed if you have the private key associated with the address. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:51:05
There is no chance that he was being 100% truthful?
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:13:03
All of those, or the online wallet could just transfer your coins elsewhere and say you never had any to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:44:29
I don't care what Bitcoin is used for, all of the same illegal activities could be paid for (and remain untraceable) with cash. 
Crypto wouldn't be the same without volatility, and I love it!

I'm failing to see why a coin in which its transactions are also valid on the main Bitcoin chain is an attack.

I'm pretty sure Google even allows the ad to link to somewhere other than what it shows, so not sure why they even bother with the .live

My transfer still hasn't gone through for me to buy on the dip, so I'm okay with 1 more day of media fud so I can buy on the cheap.

That is a lot of tinfoil. Roger Ver has done an incredible amount to increase awareness of Bitcoin.

I'm all for exposure, but I see a lot of video clips reused. It seems like I'm watching the same video over and over.

This is very painful. I could have doubled my money if I sold a week ago and bought back in right now, but I will continue to hold!

This is why you are free to choose which pool you mine with. If people have a problem with this, they will suffer the consequences.

Not so useless, I'm still up 50% on my initial investment.

It isn't a double sell unless a malicious actor makes it so. You can easily split your coins into different addresses if you just take the time to do so, then you'll be safe from replay attacks.

A 20 year old kid selling fireworks meant to scare away birds on eBay is 'selling explosives to children through the mail'? And what makes him mentally unstable?
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:29:04
But the transaction would be performed on both chains, and you'd have the same private key for the same address on seperate chains?

Bought in at $360, sold at $400, and then recently bought in at $2500. I was too dumb to educate myself about what Bitcoin ACTUALLY was when I sold @ $400.

If it were me, I'd transfer the cash into whatever exchange you are using, wait for the price to lower (As I believe it will), then buy. The last thing you want is for your coins to get caught up in a withdrawal/sell freeze on an exchange while waiting for your bank transfer to go through, like if you were using Coinbase and for some reason the coins didn't show up in your account for 2 weeks.

If it were the case that 'phantom coins' would be returned back into circulation, who's to say the coins in my wallet that are now considered phantom coins aren't just coins I plan on holding for 20 years? Gone forever :)
