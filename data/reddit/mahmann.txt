All I'm saying is bitcoin hit 19k and if it hit once it'll hit it again. But also put what you can afford to lose.

I know people do that, but I'm asking because there are people who don't do this. I have friends who bought bitcoin and other cryptos and I did this and they told me why did I sell it's better to just hodl. I explained to them that I just wanted to lock in some profits and said they should do the same but they didn't bother

This I understand. It wouldn't make sense to cash out if you're putting in every month because that money is going to go back in, and it wouldn't make sense to put that money in at a higher price when it could've gained you more profit if you left it.

Idk about 15k but I'll say somewhere close to it. It hit 10,900 a couple hours ago then dropped to around 10k and is around 10,700 slowly going up. And if it hit 10,900 once it'll definitely hit it again. Also the Big Bang theory is going to have an episode about it. I never seen an episode of the show but might just tune in but expect it to rise after the episode also so just HODL
