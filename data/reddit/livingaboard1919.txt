This is sad. It's like you guys are selling herbal life or name any other multilevel marketing scheme product

Exactly why digital currency sucks balls. I don't need pages of information to buy something at the store with cash. I give them the fucking cash and they give me the item I am buying. essentially the same with my debit card

Right ...and monkeys might fly out of my butt ..
As the saying goes

Yeah right

I think you are mistaken.  Bitcoin is not popular. The word itself is

Every digital currency out there scheme.  Remember I said that

You forgot to add the complete decimation and disappearance of Bitcoin and all digital currency for that matter

I own the fucking air my children breath as long as they live under my roof. If they want to to start spouting off about bullshit children's rights then they'll be moving the fuck out because along with rights comes responsibilities.

It's like giving somebody a pet as a gift. Now they have the responsibility to figure out how the fuck to deal with it

Exactly my thoughts

Bullshit. You can sit there and believe in paper currency or not and it has no bearing on the value. The value of paper money comes from the stability of the government.  Bitcoin has nothing backing it except a bunch of pyramid scheme bums that want "to believe" it has value.  I want to believe in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus but it ain't happening

A lot of people will be going to jail in the next few years over tax evasion

It reminds me how people, over the years, have been adamant about how whatever get rich quick scheme they have going, isn't a Ponzi scheme and all that.
I don't think this has any real long term value.  And any government intervention is just to keep people from going bankrupt due to their own stupidity. Doing stupid shit like using credit cards and second mortgages to buy this snake oil
