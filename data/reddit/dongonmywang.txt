Try reading the above posts again when you're sober and can think clearly. Try to understand my post. I made it as easy readable as possible for you druggies.

How does that answer his question? You really have problem understanding basic things, don't you? We're you born this way or is it from all the drugs you consume?

You won't get free money. Just go away.

So that's why the hits are total bs? Really, this is your unbiased, well thought out logic? Completely ignoring all the evidence from Ross his own notes, the pages and pages of chat logs, the blockchain transactions and so on. This is your conclusion???
And can you please stop crying like a little bitch about me supposedly trolling? The "i don't agree with you so you are a troll" argument is just so pathetic. Grow the fuck up.

It will once you're sober. Or you're just that dumb.

That's hilarious. That guy is such an idiot. Just that name alone already makes me cringe hard.

If he didn't want his mother to suffer maybe he shouldn't have started an illegal drug market. But such logic is out of the question for Bitcoiners of course.

I did. It changed nothing to the things i summed up above about the chat logs and Ross own goddamn logs. 
Listen junkie, let's stop. We both know what really the situation is here. Let's stop this nonsense. You love drugs and Bitcoin. You hate the government. Ross is your hero. So in your world that means he is innocent. No matter what. Even if found guilty for 10 murders you will still make up idiotic excuses why he is innocent. We both know that. 
Everybody who reads your nonsense realizes this. Everybody. Every single person in this sub. 
Can you just admit it so we can move on. Be a man and admit the obvious. Please.

Why don't you explain to us why the hits are total bs. 
I wonder what arguments you have besides i hate the government, i love drugs, Ross is my hero, so he has to be innocent. 
So go ahead. I'm waiting.
