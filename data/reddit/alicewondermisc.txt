It's not the only solution. That's the point. The issue is not critical enough to make it important that we adopt SegWit before properly investigating other options and weighing the pros and cons of the various options.
It will be fun to watch the fee war caused by a 1 MB block when SegWit is activated and people need to transfer their value to SegWit addresses so they can enjoy these protections.
Okay, no it won't be fun, it will be painful - because I'll be watching with the realization that just an ounce of humility on the part of the Core devs could have alleviated the congestion that will result when SegWit is activated.

The attack wouldn't work if the client looked at fees per byte in the last block, casting out the top and bottom 5%.
Why is core calculating fees based upon TXs in the mempool? Who had that brilliant idea?

I'm a fan of BU but I have to + this because it was funny.

It's feasible in the present and will be for several years at least. That gives plenty of time to real world test off the chain solutions rather than forcing them upon us untested because honestly, I'd rather use an alt-coin than use an untested off the chain solution which requires private keys to be on a networked computer.

Yup - core will have 40 minute (or longer) block times that won't adjust for 8 weeks (two week difficulty adjustment assumes 10 minute blocks, but with a difficulty set by all the hashpower before the fork...) - those who are vested in the BU chain have every reason to take their now worthless core coins and spam the core crippled blockchain causes transaction ability to come to a halt.
It will be really fun to watch.

My BU node didn't crash, but I updated it anyway. Fortunately, Peter stirred up a sh*tstorm with his tweet, which helped get the word out so people running BU would know they needed an update.

There were far worse bugs in the original Satoshi code, yet Bitcoin survived. So will BU.
It will survive because the vision is worth pursuing.

I tried to use it everyday but my transactions wouldn't confirm.

I'm worried about what will happen to bitcoin if there isn't a hard fork.
What happens if in a perfect world, SegWit is activated this month and LN becomes real?
That only will provide a temporary relief to the blockchain. You will never get everyone using LN and unless you centralize LN services to just a few, there won't be enough room in the blockchain to start and settle the sidechains in a timely manner.
So even with SegWit and even with LN, we either centralize on just a few side chains or we still have to hard-fork anyway to increase the block size.
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:11:31
No. Would require a hard fork anyway - might as well just go to bigger blocks. Miners decide what they put into a block, always have, so how would you mandate that every X blocks it must be a really big one?
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:32:44
Exactly. I want to be able to pay 50 cents in BTC to the New York Times to view their articles for a day. Or pay $4.00 to watch my local Roller Derby Team.
I don't want to risk my credit card information for that kind of stuff.
Coffee, I make that at home, don't much like coffee shops.

Don't worry, after the BU hard fork shows they are not dangerous, we can start planning a HF to FlexTrans to get all the benefits of SegWit without the downsides.

Too many of others are pre-mined or don't solve an actual problem, but I too once had this vision. It seems that the developers capable of creating alt-coins that aren't just a copy and paste of core code do not have the marketing skills, or use the marketing skills for a pump and dump. That's a problem.
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:39:34
Yup - I buy from them, but as soon as the BTC is available, to my local wallet it goes.

Right now BU will only activate if they sustain 75% with a possible emergency activation if User Activate Cluster Fork is tried. They do not plan to activate with just 51%.
Out of the last 1000 blocks, 29.4% were mined by miners signaling BU last time I looked. That is a bigger percentage than has ever flagged SegWit support but it still is a long way from 75%.
As far as how many are signaling BU but actually running Core, that I do not know how to determine but probably many of them, there is no need to update their mining software until after they hit 75% because they won't do the fork until they have maintained 75% for a difficulty period.
As far as testing goes, not a lot of testing is needed, it really is just a tweak.
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:18:40
When I see empty blocks, they are almost always mined very soon after the block before it. There's a reason for this. They get lucky and solve the proof of work before they have validated transactions. As soon as you solve the proof of work, you broadcast the block so you get the 12 grand block reward before someone else does.
Do you have any evidence (e.g. block numbers) showing antpool's empty blocks are different?
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:23:37
I'm not a fan of Roger. He reminds me of a slick used car salesman. But I do know that we need a bigger block, and we need it now, which means the code should have been in core three years ago. But it wasn't and it still isn't.
And no, SegWit isn't a solution I like.
I don't like Roger but I'm with BU because they are the only group doing what needs to be done.

You can't sign them offline in a business environment where your website is getting dozens (or more) of orders every hour. That just is not practical.

If this happened to you, get yourself a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:39:36
Because I would prefer to use a fixed Bitcoin.
With bigger blocks, the TX rate will not be an issue for quite some time and when it is an issue, LN or whatever other technologies for side chains exist will be both well tested and well supported and have a wealth of knowledge regarding best practices and pitfalls to avoid.
Right now, LN does not even exist. It's an untested idea and nothing more.

A cypherpunk is not and never was defined by how many alt-coins they hold.
If you are holding alt-coins so you can call yourself a cypherpunk then you don't have a clue what a cypher-punk really is.

It only allows scaling through off the chain transactions, which require software on top of bitcoin that has access to your private keys - needed to sign the smart contracts.
One of the values of bitcoin, I can generate addresses either ahead of time or deterministic for which the private key is offline yet still see when those addresses are paid so I can ship product to customers.
I can't do that with LN, it forces me to a less secure set-up where a private key is on a network connected computer.
Maybe you don't mind that risk, but many don't want that risk. We need bigger blocks and there is no logical reason not to increase the block size.

I think it was an attempt to halt a perceived spam attack actually.
