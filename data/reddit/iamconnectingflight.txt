Just when the Winklevoss Twins thought Zuckerberg had stopped copying them...

Boys please, can’t we all just get along? Make gains, not war.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:04:00
Thanks! That makes a lot of sense.

Would anyone mind explaining to me the benefit of limiting or capping new users on exchanges?

I’m in the UK and I own some, I know quite a few people who do. But we do run in online media / YouTube / dev communities so it’s biased.
A lot of my UK friends didn’t know about it before a few months ago, or at least didn’t understand it. Now it’s mentioned in every other Facebook post I see... It’s picking up at least awareness if not actual adoption.

Thanks for this explanation!

Doubled down during the dip. Feeling good about it. Hodlers holler!

Their marketing materials for this are so vague. Is this going to be worthwhile or piss in the wind?

Could someone ELI5 how this new Lightning update will improve the transaction infrastructure?
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:32:19
This is terrifying. Anything like this should definitely be reported
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:43:14
But how do you feeeel? I want to understand you on an emotional level

It’s subject the same regional capital gains laws as any other commodity. Please pay your taxes! (People who don’t give crypto a bad rep.) ��

I definitely check too often, especially just before bed and first thing in the morning. It’s cutting into time for other important things, like washing and masturbating...

If it says it has expired that usually means you did not send payment / they did not receive it. Are you buying via bank transfer or card transaction?

Typically exchanges only guarantee the quoted price for 10-15 minutes. It may be that you took to long to go through the whole process.

LocalBitcoins cuts down fees significantly and you can buy large amounts. It’s peer-to-peer, so you transfer directly with the seller a little like Craigslist or eBay. It feels sketchy at first, but I have had no problems.

I’m giving part of a coin to my dad this Xmas. He’s got really interested in speculative investments this year and has been asking me about my hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:51:17
So how is CME doing?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:25:55
So the BTC price has been the most stable it’s been in weeks the last couple of days. Can this be attributed to the first futures contracts launching? And how does everyone feel about it?

Hate to be that guy but what is this clip from?

Finally! I paid good money for a roller coaster and the last few days have been a gentle swan ride.

Hate to be that guy but this is actually unsupported by the numbers. It’s just a great story because we all love porn

I’m staying on the ship.

Good time for anyone who needs to transfer away from exchanges etc
