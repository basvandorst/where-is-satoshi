I think this person should, because he already owns bitcoins.  If he wants to withdraw them he has to pay a fee from an exchange or coinbase.  If he spends them directly, no fee.

If you look at the bubble chart, there are two periods where we could be right now.  Bear trap, or Return to "normal."  The main deciding factor between the two seems to be whether we have passed the public phase or if it is still yet to come.  
Google trends is a good way to judge public awareness. We can see on the trends chart that bitcoin had huge spikes during the two really major bubbles to 260 and 1100.  It's also pretty clear that the current spike that we have, while notable, doesn't compare to the prior two spikes.  
This is particularly true when we look at how high it rises from the baseline, as opposed to absolute rise.  The prior rises went from 5 to 61, a 1200% increase, and from 12 to 100, an 800% increase.  The current increase is from 19 to 28, which is a 39% increase.  
The difference between those really big spikes is that back then nobody had heard of bitcoin.  It was this really interesting thing that people wanted to read more about.  This time, even though the price action is good, most people who read a news story or hear about it don't go searching for bitcoin because they already know what it is.
For that reason, I don't think that we are going to see much more to the public phase of this, which makes me think that our chart is in the return to "normal" phase.
People keep talking about how their friend called them up to ask about bitcoin, but those anecdotes are not statistically meaningful.
