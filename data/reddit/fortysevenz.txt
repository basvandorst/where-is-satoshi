You see, noone knows. I only know I invested 30 minutes ago at 12.000€  and hoping for the best, like all. I think now with Christmas and New Year we have this confusing times cause people are more focused on family and there are other expenses involved as well, after a New Year we could see a change in that, and hopefully then bull run from Bitcoin.

Yes just a lot more to gain with greater possibilty.

Yeah would be great if someone would explain this. I want to move my coins to secure place but these transaction fees and all this 100.000 transaction pileup are lowering my confidence to do so. 
Also fees are really high atm, so I’ll wait a little bit.

Hmm....that is really hard to track

I think most people who bought bitcoin have some computer knowledge or are even coders themself. This sets them up for a nice future which ever way bitcoin goes.
