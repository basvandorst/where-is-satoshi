agree. my bet is if they push hard on this people will panic sell out of Alts/Eth and back to BTC for a short period. Would certainly be nice to see the ICO fraud shut down its just another thing that is stopping electronic currencies from gaining mainstream validity.

this. if you live in a country like say Switzerland there are zero capital gains taxes.

As with all things software it's a matter of when not if . Look at bugs like OpenSSL heartbleed or Dan Kaminsky's 2008 DNS vulnerability. Two technologies that operated years without a major issue and provided fundamental internet infrastructure . Exploits will be inevitable it's a matter of how well the community will respond which will ultimately determine if trust/sustainability can be maintained .

Not sure where you are going but there is a decent network of Bitcoin ATMs in Switzerland.

Considering 50 years ago we didn't even have the internet, very.

this is for all train stations in Switzerland and has been for a while. Unfortunately you cannot pay with bitcoin. It's a deal with bitcoin suisse from what I remember.

This is pretty funny. In 2012, it was estimated that the total assets under management in Swiss private banking to be $6.15 trillion (equivalent to more than a third of the annual GDP of the EU or the US), about half of it being managed by the two international banks: UBS and Credit Suisse.

he's just a bot - he says the same thing to anyone posting about Kraken and their horrible unreliable garbage. I was getting timeouts all day also and its not the first time either.
