I posted the same thing here and got downvoted  
Bitcoin is too hard to use and store securly for even IT professionals.
We need a "Bitcoin bank" that the average person can keep their Bitcoin, let it gain interest or invest it and not have to worry about losing it. No one wants to keep $100k under their pillow.

These are the type of services I was thinking that a normal bank provides (though I doubt an existing FIAT bank would allow BTC as collateral) that would be great for Bitcoin owners to have.
I think each service I listed has been done by a company but no company provides all of them in one package.

You are still depositing and withdrawing in Bitcoin (or instant fiat conversion if you like). 
People looking to invest in Bitcoin that are not IT literate.

Most people have fear of storing $100k in their house.
I am well aware of the benefits that Bitcoin brings and do not wish to try and regulate or stop it.
It's an alternative but much needed service.

Most people trust their banks ledger now.

You said try. This is a very difficult space for most people to get into. I have worked with Bitcoin for 3 years but every day when I speak to people, even people with years of IT experience, they do not trust themselves to securely store their own Bitcoin. Like a lot of people would not want to keep all their cash under the bed. They trust a 3rd party, bank, to securely store it for them.

Thanks. I am a programmer that has worked with Bitcoin for 3 years. I would start developing this if I knew it was something that would be worthwhile and that there wasn't already a site with millons invested doing the same thing. This is me doing some research to see if it is something I should try.
