Crypto is useful for taking control of a % of your net worth. 2008 proved to a lot of people that banks are not totally dependable.

Sounds like all the ingredients for a great bag-holding experience.

That doesn’t address the lack of talent and product behind the team. Tron is like a bad kickstarter.

You don’t understand the psychology of value. That’s why you aren’t cashing out thousands like a lot of us. You’re short-sighted. Many of us have seen this coming for years.

You’re so disconnected that you aren’t even aware people have been saying this since 2011. I take it you didn’t buy in.

Explain your reasoning for a “massive drop”. The only time there has ever been a massive drop was because of a black swan event.

You know it’s standard investment advice now to buy crypto, right? It’s been that way since the Spring bull-run. You sound (understandably) salty your “logic” failed to earn you money on as of now the best investment opportunity of the 21st century.

I use the salty meme maybe twice a year, and this is a rare circumstance where I believe someone is actually salty they missed out.

i cannot fathom buying into bitcoin at these prices, good lord. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:26:19
it's already happening.

you're coming off as a presumptuous, pessimistic, and probably chronically depressed jerk. oh, and you're most likely totally wrong so you also might be stupid. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:18:45
You're a little slow aren't ya

no one is going to buy your trezor dude. get real. anyone reading this: always get a hardware wallet directly from company or from a certified dealer, not some guy on reddit. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:15:33
honestly, just don't even worry about bitcoin you're really just going to be giving other people money.

Credible people backed him. Not that hard to consider. Meanwhile you're taking this easily doctored post and your own intuition as evidence it's not him? I'm not a fan by any means but when important, well-known people in the BTC community backed up his claims it's no wonder people will believe it. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:54:00
nah i agree with you

Gavin was appointed by Satoshi, even he supported Wright. Nothing absurd about people taking his word for it.
