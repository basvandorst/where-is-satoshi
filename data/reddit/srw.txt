If you want to jumpstart to developing smart contracts in RSK take a look at (our) the following articles:
* [Introduction to Smart Contracts Development in RSK](
* [ERC20 Token Development on RSK with OpenZeppelin](
* [ERC20 Token Development on RSK with OpenZeppelin and Web3.py](
Hope it helps!

Obviously, the insurance stuff was a very smart move by Coinbase. It is interesting to take a look at the related reddit submission:

Where can I create multi-signature wallets with the new site?
@_date: 2014-12-20 15:20:57
I agree with your general sentiment and personally I like Coinbase as a good alternative to store your wallet when you don't want to think a little bit about backups and fraud. They have insurance and that's a game changer.
My concern is about the future and off-chain transactions without fees being more convenient than using the blockchain. If almost everyone is on Coinbase the major part of the transactions will be in their ecosystem making bitcoin/cryptocurrencies marginal. Online stores don't care about this. I think the bitcoin community needs to think about making solutions to attract this kind of public.
An interesting discussion from 2013 is [The sad state of Wallets…for posterity](

Coinbase has insurance against negative outcomes. I think this is a game changer and plays in favor of Coinbase.

In off blockchain transaction it's trivial to solve these kind of technical problems but the performance limitations of bitcoins must be addressed sooner or later. In some way is an important computer science / philosophical / economic problem.

1. Import every address inside the bip32-wallet to bitcoin core using the *importaddress* command.
1. Call wallet.setUnspentOutputs for every new transaction connected to this addresses. Check number of confirmations with the blocknotify event.
1. Send the transactions using the transaction builder shown in the test code.

What an elusive term "responsible" is.

Beyond the specific issue about block size, joining an open source team as a developer doesn't give you ownership rights to the project and any improvement can be blocked.

You can do the same in Argentina.
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:19:50
Why? Argentina has recently returned to a free USD market.
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:51:40
As an Argentinian I am confident that will not happen, but we are playing just a prediction game. We can bet something about this if you want.
@_date: 2016-06-09 21:09:28
Thanks John, taking a look at it now.
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:07:39
Argentinian here, I am sure Argentina is not on the list. Currently, the most interesting thing about Argentina and cryptocurrencies is the local development scene.

Indeed it is the present, we were working on smart contract security since 2014.

Again, you just posted a fallacy that goes against the central point of discussion. There is no point of continuining this discussion.

I think it is pretty easy to argue against Paul Krugman and instead of bashing him we need to build logical arguments against his thinking. These are my argumens and I am not a Bitcoin fundamentalist:
1/ Bitcoin is the first sound innovation in P2P transactions. It is not perfect (e.g. miners concentration, governance issues) but it is a milestone in human history. Bitcoin is a natural innovation in economy, it is something that humans were loooking for for centuries.
2/ I see Bitcoin as an application. We choose Bitcoin instead of other cryptocurrencies because of network effects.
3/ The Bitcoin value and price are related to its use on making transactions. I think Bitcoin is more a descentralized application than a descentralized currency, and its price its based on these qualities.
4/ If you live and work in US you might not need bitcoins, and this is why he doesn't realize its potential.

I think before submitting a plan we need to fund/perform a market research. Will we try to convince "Starbucks" to use bitcoins or businesses related to tourism? For example, my dad is an artist working in two art walks and connected to a lot of artists. Will it interesting to explore that market? Sure, the are a lot of tourists there and the artists only receive cash but before pushing Bitcoin there I need to the check if my hypothesis could work.
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:31:01
Your point makes any discussion impossible and it is a [fallacy](
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:10:07
The Bitcoin market represents now a very tiny number of buyers and sellers, which means that a potential large number of newcomers would introduce a lot of volatility.
@_date: 2016-12-18 13:21:06
I don't want to start a flame war but in Coinbase you are always guilty, even when you are not notified. For example, last week I received an e-mail from them saying that I could be involved with online gambling. Besides I didn't make any transaction connected with online gambling, I felt offended by this accusation. I imagine other users receiving e-mails about buying illicit drugs or buying child pornography...
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:32:55


What do they mean with blockchain? In [another]( article it says they use Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.
@_date: 2016-12-11 14:24:41
You didn't understand my comment. Satoshi can sign his e-mails with a secp256k1 key linked to his Bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2016-12-11 22:30:06
Everyone could invent million of stories more probable that the previous both.
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:40:34
In addition to sending e-mails, signing the e-mail with a Satoshi key is the right way to probe he/she is the real Satoshi.

Too much drama. Argentina has been living in these economic cycles for long time and this is the way everything works.

It is Easy. At the end there are other measures where you loose less money than using bitcoins. I made the calc and it is easier and cheaper to use other methods if you plan tu use the money immediately.

I did an informal experiment when I was studying for my CS degree: I compiled a set of not so complex logic puzzles and gave them to my smart friends and my mother, grandmother and girlfriend who were completely outside the CS field. In general, my family and girlfriend was better than my CS friends.
This can't be obviously generalized but the methods used by my mother, grandmother, and girlfriend where less restricted than my friends formalizations. Obviously this can't be extrapolated to very complex research problems that require years of study in a specific field.

All the BitPay's Bitcore stuff is being actively developed but you can make improvements or integrations in some areas. You can take a look at specific contributions we made: 
@_date: 2015-09-25 01:14:25


This is where third party services like  play their role. I think all the bitcore code is great and the developers behind it top notch.
If you look well Copay tries to solve in multi-sig but others not even offer: how to do out-of-band communication between copayers. How copayers join other wallets? How are the notified of proposed transactions? I played with Coinbase and BitGo APIs and they are in an inferior league.

No, you are talking about developed countries. In non developed countries the interest rate is very arbitrary and it will not decrease because the market forces are much more in favor of banks than in developed countries.
You can say that banks are powerful anywhere but when all, and I mean ALL, the state fuses are broken the price is  loosely connected to supply, demand, and risk.

Beyond the title, talking about Shor's algorithm makes an intersection with Bitcoin.

There is a costly but relatively simple and efficient way of attacking the Bitcoin network by any State. They can spend a lot of money in mining and proceed with the well known security attacks. Bribing miners can be a variation of this. Full stop.

Yes, but there are three keys: a coinbase key, a shared key, and a user key. To  make a transaction you need either the coinbase key and the shared key and the transaction is performed inside coinbase OR the shared key and the user key and the transaction is performed outside coinbase. Now, you can't make a transaction using the coinbase and the user key.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:22:21
I like well-intentioned criticism but there are fundamentals in Bitcoin that are objectively positive. One example is money loans. In many countries banks lend money at 60%. Cryptocurrencies disrupt this as a good arbitrage. This is obviously not perfect since your debt is in dollars or bitcoins but, taking into account the risk, can be a good option.
@_date: 2015-11-05 11:21:15
One of the core ideas with multisig is interoperability. If Coinbase let you do this you can integrate it with other antifraud systems such as Sig3 or Cryptocorp.

I mean, if I have a 2-2 wallet in Copay and I pay a third party, my copayer doesn't need to be online and can accept the transaction later.

Coinbase has many similarities with PayPal. Sincerely it is incredible that the descentralized non-regulated experience with Bitcoin is much better.
