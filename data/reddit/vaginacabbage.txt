Short answer:  Yes when you sold for USD you had a taxable event even if Coinbase held your coins and made the sale for you.   Capital Gains taxes must be paid.
However, I am more intrigued by your other problem, namely:  That you have 6 figures sitting at Coinbase and no way to withdraw it.   
They fall under "know your customer" law for finance so you'll probably have to provide ID and personal information in order to transfer that large of an amount.  But to be clear:  once you meet the KYC requirements, there is no technical reason they can't send you that money the next second.
edit:  In case it's not obvious, it's a HUGE problem if Coinbase is artificially restricting withdrawals.   The only legit reason to do that is for "know your customer" reasons so once those are satisfied, customers should be able to withdraw what they want and when they want without obstacles.

That is completely unacceptable based on how much money of yours they hold in custody.   
Please keep us updated on your experience.  There are many watching closely to see how this goes.  There is no point selling coins via Coinbase if you are unable to withdraw your money.  No legitimate financial institution operates that way.
I understand they have to go through know your customer documentation and regs but once those are satisfied, there should be no impediments between you and your money.  If they are purposely monkeying with the know your customer process to slow it down so you can't withdraw higher amounts, there is a problem here
