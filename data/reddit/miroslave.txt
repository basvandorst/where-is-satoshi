Fair headsup
@_date: 2013-08-17 16:04:35
Some stupid new SatoshiDice rip off has been faking bulk bets/transactions in order to get advertising on blockchain.info front page recent transactions list. They continuously send their addresses coins. 
Just watch on blockchain.info

Looks like you found PrimeDice's main account haha -  ("Bank: 1750")
And you can just mix coins. They do a... decent job
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:19:27
Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks a lot.
Thanks heaps to the other replies too. Appreciate it!

Doog wins 11,000 of investors money
@_date: 2013-08-02 00:45:35
Bitcoin is lucky to have people like you :).
@_date: 2013-10-20 06:55:21
More gambling sites. We're still a few hundred short I'm thinking
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:03:39
Isn't hard to find ones address now days..
@_date: 2013-10-22 02:23:43
You could just as easily be down $38,000.
This is like saying why use a savings account when you can go all in on black.

Buying Bitcoin isn't very difficult at all.. he will DEFINITELY spend more time buying the miners, setting them up, etc. opposed to simply using Coinbase or even an exchange.
I'm sorry, but I completely disagree.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:03:53
I'm not talking about finding people directly from the internet. People you already know or know of. When you go rob someone of cash, you don't go to the internet to find someone worthwhile. You start with people you know of in real life
@_date: 2013-08-24 15:35:08
RIP mining
@_date: 2013-09-23 08:56:45
Grats on the new house &amp; car, Doog!
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:52:03
ITS ALL GONE WRONG
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:31:53
To be fair, that is still a casino's turnover. Their profit margin is 1%. 
It's similar to any businesses turnover, they then take their profit margin in accordance to that.

You obviously have no idea what he's truly behind :P
@_date: 2013-10-04 07:57:59
Just like Google changes the search engine results to suit your interests. It has obviously detected that you're interested in Bitcoin and as a result has tailored your finance page for you.
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:27:18
Amazing stuff. This looks extremely hopeful. Thanks a lot for you contribution to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:09:03
This looks extremely hopeful! 
Best of luck, will definitely be trying this service when it releases, it surely looks extremely hopeful!
@_date: 2013-09-07 14:46:53
Had a good laugh at some of the email you're displaying. Grats on the tip, hopefully more to come :).
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:15:16
Pretty awesome site. Didn't know about it. Great news on increased traffic.
@_date: 2013-09-10 08:15:21
Erik has done so much more than anyone has any idea of. He will end up being one of the wealthiest individuals in the world some day, and he'll never be able to claim it. 
Keep ballin' Erik.
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:16:35
Pretty proportional risk really. If you want Bitcoins, buy them now, there's never really a right time to buy...
@_date: 2013-08-19 06:10:36
Stunna who owns PrimeDice is a legend. Cheers m8
@_date: 2013-10-04 04:44:16
Not to mention BitcoinTalk is hacked... I don't see how this isn't negatively affecting things.
@_date: 2013-10-28 05:23:23
How on Earth do people still believe that other currency's are backed by something? Fuck it's annoying. And what's up with the guy saying that the USD and other fiat is SAFER because it has government bodies regulating the PRINTING OF MONEY. 
Some people should not be allowed in any form of spotlight.

@_date: 2013-10-18 15:20:22
Thanks! Similar to drcode's reply, but that's exactly what I was looking for.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:01:10
Found someone thx
@_date: 2013-08-15 06:44:37
Majority of those transactions are just between wallets &amp; more or less completely useless.
@_date: 2013-09-05 13:53:14
We need to start seeing titles like this, but for businesses which are not involved in gambling. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:06:08
But if they know you have more?.. 
A lot of people are very public about their wealth, and if Bitcoin was ever to take off, it won't be hard to make assumptions. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 10:51:58
Doubt they could have got money into an exchange that quickly..
@_date: 2013-08-04 11:33:44
Slow as fuck for me.
@_date: 2013-10-04 07:56:00
No one gives a fuck about this scam site. This was most likely a set up, something to reinstate faith into investors. 
No matter what happens, Just-Dice profits continue to fall, they'll drop to a new time low of -8k next time probably.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:13:54
Doubt it. They're coins which were dormant since before SR was even first opened (May be wrong?), let alone started turning real profit. M
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:04:57
Vast majority of people won't be able to withdraw much money from an ATM. An ATM is usually always in a very public place. 
Bitcoin has no limits, and can be accessed from any computer which doesn't have to be in a public place.
@_date: 2013-08-04 13:45:41
I don't see how this will work well in Paypal's favor... They're probably going to charge obscene levels of fee's &amp; only find a way to dick people over none the less.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:05:25
The money can also be very easily traced to the thief. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:34:59
As much as I want to think this is great news, it's not going to be able to put China back in the game as the leading player again. 
You can't exactly buy $1m in gift cards with ease.

Is there any way that the person running the tip bot could chuck a runner haha? You'd hope not. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 03:17:54
Keen to see the final verdict on this one
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:03:28
Talking about home address, not Bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 04:49:42
Strong crash mate. Up up up upupupppp wew
@_date: 2013-10-19 11:24:07
It'll definitely not aid people who have kept an eye on Bitcoin, but don't really know much about it. News headlines saying "mBTC is worth $1.70" could be easily misinterpreted 
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:53:07
Completely agree. This has become an absolute joke. People continue to GIVE their money to Doog, it's ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:43:18
And I just realised there's a pub that accepts Bitcoin extremely close to me!
I'm coming to support you Fitzroy hotel :)
@_date: 2013-08-04 11:33:26
Try PrimeDice.com, way better odds &amp; easier to use.
