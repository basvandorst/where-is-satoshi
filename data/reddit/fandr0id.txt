All my money is scattered around all the exchanges, two weeks back fucktopia gave me a heart attack, then last month kuckload with the bankrupcy. Are all the other wallets that bad?

Things are changing now mate. Previously only a handful were getting into the crypto world, now the authorities fear it might go mainstream... hence surely there will be repercussions.

at what point do you think one should start cashing out? banks or p2p?
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:52:07
Oops, no. The earnings are pretty high nothing like i would like to spend on the internet for things i would buy and not use them.

Until everything crashes or the govt plans a crackdown?

Agree with that!! But everyone starts somewhere.. i am late, but i hope not very late.. hence the question.. what do i do now after transferring money to gdax?

Ah i see. I have been reading around the forum, looks like folks are very positive about ltc? u think investing 40% in ltc, 35% in btc and 25% eth is a good bet?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:29:52
Thanks that was not nice.

Are there faster ways to buy btc or other coins, the funding takes long from banks to coinbase to gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:36:37
took your advice and brought all btc for today. So now that i brought the btc, how do i see what my profit is looking hourly on gdax? I gotta show it to wifey.. so that she allows me to invest more.. lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:46:51
what are the few other coins you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:16:17
You are true. But we are not comparing btc to ltc. Surely ltc cannot touch btc's pricepoint, but dont think it might break 1000 or 2000+ barrier in the next month or so?
Think.. if we invest few thousand dollars on ltc.. wont it double up anytime soon?

Thanks for the great tip. So basically once u move money into ur gdax account, you go an buy alt or bitcoins.. right?
I was thinking to invest 30% in btc, 50% in ltc and 20 in eth.
Can i do all this in gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:28:37
Thanks, so buy and hold is the strategy for me..? Should i buy from Gdax?
Whats a good amount to start with day trade?

Coinbase takes to transfer money from the bank. The first time i did two week.. took over 8 days. What are the other options do i have to buy coins and transfer it over to gdax for buying more coins?
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:15:01
I guess you must have got into btc months back, price was much better and btc made the mark today. I doubt how much more its gonna go up if i have to buy with the current prices. I plan to buy coins every few weeks. Until i have invested atleast 20,000
So with keeping profit in mind, dont u think if someone has to invest today ltc would be better, cos thats one coin that has potential to grow.. maybe cross 5000 usd?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:32:44
I see.. Thats what i wanted to know.
So people can hold money and still be able to reap profits? i was under an impression that u need to trade in order to gain the profits?
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:06:47
What is a great portfolio for now?
35% btc
40% ltc
25% ether?
