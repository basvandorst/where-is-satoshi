I wouldn't say all cloud mining is a scam, I have made a killing at [LTCGear]( they sell their scrypt hashing power for about ~5$ / MH which is the best on the market. I have TXid's to prove my payouts and I am currently making over 2 BTC a week and next week I should be at 3-4 BTC a week.

As long as you have two factor authentication and you keep your computer clean, you should be fine. People will attack everyday forever, it's only a problem if they get in. I work in IT and I see logon requests from Iran, China, all over, everyday.

There will always be an increase in power. Always. It will continue to get harder just at a negative exponential growth rate til it only increase a tiny bit. Mining equipment will continue to get stronger. But the price will come down over time as well.

I actually see this as pretty cool. The FBI is involved enough in the BTC community that they know about mixing the coins and trying to get these coins to people with a fresh slate, that way they are not using "Dirty" money.

Exactly, it's always like "BREAKING NEWS CHINA BANKS CLOSE ACCOUNT FOR EXCHANGE, ARE CUSTOMER FUNDS SAFE???" It's annoying, and it causes the weak willed to panic sell. Not everyone is as confident as us in Bitcoin and people scaring others into selling to get cheap coins is unethical. I am not against free market, I just don't like to see people manipulated.

Instead of just sending purchase requests over and over, which looks like the activity of a compromised account, call them, tell them you are in fact trying to make a purchase and you do have ownership of the account. You probably threw a red flag trying to purchase from two different IP's or something. Just call them.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:06:00
A safe solution at the moment is to buy/sell from Coinbase and you can even store your mined coins there, although 99% of people would suggest not to. Just be sure to enable 2-factor authentication and you should be golden.
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:49:15
This was probably the best case scenario besides Jesus himself buying them and endorsing Bitcoin. Thompson is HUGE in the accounting field. Tim showing this much support being such a big name in the financial markets is going to be big. Buy price per coin no longer matters!

I had a bad experience with Glyde. I sold my iphone and had it shipped to the buyer in one days time. He got it and waited a few days and then marked it for return. He then held onto my phone for OVER a month claiming he never got a box etc. meanwhile I never saw any BTC. Finally I got my phone back after much stress. This left a very sour taste in my mouth. However I did successfully sell 2 PS4 games on there without problem.

I wouldn't suggest holding any alt coins, but you can certainly learn how to play the swings on them. Just make sure to pick a coin that has volume.

I expect that people know how to communicate when there is different levels of understanding at play. They don't want to hear about cold storage. They want it to be automated behind the scenes.

I would hope they are smart enough to not dump nearly 30k coins onto a low market cap like this. I am betting they won't. So I don't think this is what caused it. I think some bigger players saw we broke a long term support trend line and to them it looked like a good time to sell so they can get in lower.

On the other hand, I decided to go with LTCGear instead of Gaw a few months ago.

The markets opinion based upon rarity, usability, scalability, security, and a few other properties give bitcoin its value backing. If the market decided it was worthless it would drop to near zero.

As long as it's long and complex (essentially un-crackable via hash) and you are the only one who knows it, I would say you are fine.
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:20:37
Blockchain.info since you have the private keys. But if you really only care about convenience then I would say Coinbase, they have been reliable and they have a pretty sweet android app that you can passcode lock transactions with.

@_date: 2014-05-14 22:09:58
Well I hope you made enough to cover it. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:25:37
I wouldn't call it an edge. Someone is guaranteed 75% and someone else is guaranteed 25%. That is not affected by the "house edge".

Even though most of you are upset about Circle not inviting, you ever think it may be worth it for them to hold out and test the shit out of it so they know they won't end up a Mt. Gox for reasons of unpreparedness?

I seriously do not get how you all can be so wrong. Yes the cost per GH/s is higher on Cex.io. Yes you pay a maintenence fee. Yes Ghash is evil yada yada. But guess what, for the past two months the price of GH/s has actually gone up not down. I have been reinvesting all of my mined BTC from Cex.io slowly increasing my hashrate. I started with 6 BTC and after one month I had 7+ BTC. I am not advocating for Cex.io or Ghash, but these blind comments about how people who use it are idiots and are all losing their shirt is total bullshit. Do some research before spouting nonsense. I am sure this will be downvoted to hell because I didn't follow the reddit mantra of DOWN WITH GHASH!

I don't work at Apple or "the catholic church", where I work, as long as there is nothing else I need to be attending to it is perfectly fine to be on Reddit. It just doesn't make sense to me to group porn into the Bitcoin subreddit which is generally for news and discussions just because there is a slight Bitcoin reference in it. Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream, it may be referenced in just about anything soon, doesn't mean it has to be posted here. My main point is that there is probably a better place to post this kind of thing then the main Bitcoin subreddit.

I've grown to fucking hate this community. It used to be nice. It used to be welcoming. It used to be a teaching place. Now its filled with trolls and elitists. I wish it would return to what it was. But I guess this is an inevitable downside to gaining mainstream attention, you get all kinds of people. Including assholes. Hopefully we can overcome the jerks and really have some fun and do some cool things here again soon.

I work for a MSP and I did the scans to ensure no one had installed miners on any of our machines for this very reason. It crushes the CPU/GPU when mining. Completely irresponsible of them to think it wouldn't be noticed and taking the risk to begin with... I don't feel bad for them.

The Coinbase app actually has the QR reader built into it if you are on Android at least. So simply scan the QR code supplied by the retailer. It should autopopulate the address and amount, and then just hit send. Most places will "accept" the payment as soon as they get notification of the transaction broadcast.
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:11:47

Jesus, all of this procedure is going to drive people away from Bitcoin. It should not be this hard. They talk about personal security and responsibility. Just keep your computer cleaned and have a backup USB in your desk drawer. Or improve upon services like Coinbase and blockchain.info so much that they can guarantee the safety of your stored coins with insurance. That is what needs to happen for this to be accessible to the masses. I can guarantee you that if making your Bitcoin safe is a 20 step process with dual booting offline OS's and running encryption programs that we will never succeed. People are generally to stupid for that. Think about your grandparents attempting to create a cold storage wallet. That Bitcoin will be gone and unrecoverable in a day.

Unfortunately I assume without a jailbreak you may be out of luck. Obviously this suggestion may not fit your desires but I bought a nexus 5 with most of the reasoning pertaining to this kind of thing and I am very happy with that decision.

You do realize its possible the guests of that event could be earnings 6+ figures a year. I mean hell they were there and not at work.  Today's spike was 10+ dollars in one candle. 1k BTC in volume only. Completely plausible people in that room could have afftected the price. Were not THAT big yet. Especially to the extremely wealthy. Bill gates could still buy the entire market cap 10 times over. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:08:38
Jeeeeezz, some lucky bastard just made out on that flip.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:08:49
Holy shit. I thought this was all FUD. I really hope Gox didn't do permanent damage do the bitcoin community. Thank God I went with Coinbase from the start. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:30:09
Can someone ELI5 why this has an effect on bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:02:04
That was one of the funniest videos I have seen in a long time, Anyone who trades on OKCoin can relate. It looks decent, we should bounce up, going long.... OH GOD CHINA WHY???
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:30:55
In case no one thought to ask you, what was your bid price?
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:24:19
My gain loss is currently -$600 and it doesn't bother me. I have faith in the long term. Also a note, I would be positive, but a while back I wasn't as confident and panic sold only to buy right back at a loss. Moral of the story, let it ride!
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:27:16

Post tx id showing 15 coins going to that address otherwise I'm leaning towards BS.

DOES NOT MEAN REVOKED. It could have just expired. It happens. Don't be so sensational.
They do need to fix this though.
EDIT: Also I just checked Chrome and IE and I do not get this alert.

A lot of people. Read the front page of this sub. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:50:07
Just another note. You should use 2-step verification for anything that involves sensitive information. Your bank account, your email that has info about your bitcoin/bank accounts. It's a great security leap and it takes litteraly one second.

So much negativity in this thread, fuck the haters, grats to you buddy.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:29:09
I did the same thing a while back and it costed me some profit. But I got back in and took the loss as a now smarter person. You live, you learn.

Yep, same. Never any problems though with withdraw or deposit. Just shit luck.
@_date: 2014-08-22 13:22:43
Good for them, this is what we need in Bitcoin, we need accountability. It's not so much regulation, it's keeping a company that has custodial access of your Bitcoin accountable. This isn't the wild west, this is actually quite the opposite. We are a modern group of people with a futuristic technology. This is how mainstream joins in. When it is no longer the money for internet drug dealers and hackers. Excellent work!

I wish Red Bull accepted Bitcoin, I may die of a heart attack if that happens, but it would be a happy and energetic heart attack.

Learn how to trade. You will lose most likely.  But if you learn from it and get better it can be very lucrative. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:44:27
Interesting read.

Yeah I was one of them. Head on  ejected from the car. If I was wearing it I wouldn't be typing this. But I accept that as my lightning strike and I wear my seat belt every time.

Then that is the solution. Better competition for cex.io. telling people to stop does nothing. Their competitors need to force their hand.

Sounds like a little bitch fight between small little community planners, not all of Manhattan saying no to bitcoin. Bit sensational...

This is clearly not him...
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:48:36
They still both misrepresented the inherent security that Bitcoin has. Bitcoin is nothing like the data that sony was supposed to protect. You can't hack bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:05:27
What about the sell portion? Does that instantly get ACH deposited as well? Or do you still have to wait on that.
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:45:56
Can you try sweeping the private keys to a different wallet?
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:49:38
Hahaha that is great.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:48:02
I wanted to do this but with Verifone. That would enable nearly everywhere in the US to accept bitcoin. But I don't have the programming experience or the start up money. Also Verifone requires you to use their SDK and that costs like 10k I think. But if someone does have those things jump on it and get rich. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:16:20
Just bought a desk off Overstock with Bitcoin, so yes.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:21:35
The fact that BTC folks blindly praise him is disturbing to me. He's hired people to kill others, don't care what else he did.
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:25:39
I bet a bullet would say otherwise.
@_date: 2014-08-22 17:55:23
If you want to avoid fees you need to trade peer to peer. Coinbase is offering a service and you are opting to use it. If you create an exchange you can make it free but I doubt you will want to do that due to the time needed to make it and the compliance and fees you would take on. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:23:51
Actually this the low of 2014

That's the new "In" design for a website. You'll see it all over for tech companies.

Are you doing anything new or planning to in order to mitigate clawback on settlement?
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:43:37
Jesus guys I am all for fun. But in order for bitcoin to really take off it needs to be taken seriously. That's not a crazy statement. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:50:18
How about a source?
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:52:38
I did. Nothing. Provide your source if you want to be taken seriously.
