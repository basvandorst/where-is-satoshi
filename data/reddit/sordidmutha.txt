Do you have complete physical control over your server? If so, where do you live? Comcast is the fzstest that's available to me. It's like $70/mo for 15m upload. I live in a major metropolitan area.

Is it not?

I'm new to bitcoin and just heard of from this thread. After a cursory survey, i found seemingly the opposite of this statement:


It seems like they think Segwit is made by a moneyed interest (Blockstream, the company), and that will centralize power with that company. They say it undermine the utility of Bitcoin to average users by increasing txn fees to $5 or more, increasing txn acceptance time, introducing the need to trust third parties, etc.  
What am I missing? Surely there's more to this than I know.

Eh, BTC is gonna get taxed one way or another, unless you live innawoods and only transact with others who live innawoods
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:11:58
Why not just generate a paper wallet? Tax treatment?
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:58:41
fair enough. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 14:59:07
What do you mean "scale in layers"?
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:03:07
What do you think needs to happen to bitcoin for long-term adoption?
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:58:24
I was really excited about Bitcoin until this thread and all the positive replies. Time to open a short position.
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:15:26
Thanks for explanation!
Does this open up vulnerabilities though? By 'another network' I take it there's another 'sub chain'. What's to prevent multiple sub-chains  and people from double usage of a coin over the two sub-chains? seems like that could become extremely convoluted extremely quickly.
I don't mean to nay-say, I'm just genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:35:51
appalling or appealing?
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:14:34
Don't you worry that the server could be compromised?
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:01:03
What kind of fees are you guys talking? I've been dealing with .25 usd (basically) fees, which doesn't seem bad. What do you guys think of as low-fee?

Sorry OP, your english just isn't quite good enough for this kind of article. Neither is your explanation of contemporary finance or the motivations for investment. If this were the first thing I'd read about Bitcoin, I'd probably have thought it was a scam. 
A for effort, though.

Also have had success with Gemini. It was a much smaller amount, however it's NY based and regulated, so you probably have legal recourse if necessary. I doubt they'd risk legitimacy over a four-digit number though.

Posts like his make me worried that bitcoin really is a bubble.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:33:46
Mathematically yes, but practically, it's indistinguishable. Third-parties require trust and it sucks.
I read a payment channel example that involved sending a 100k satoshi payment to a bar at the beginning of the week, and them sending back whatever wasn't required to pay for your tab. Sure, I'll totally hand a random bartender $100 on monday, then expect my chang to be fairly paid on friday.

bitcoin doesn't have the depth that traditional instruments do, especially considering some of the major exchanges (coinbase, poloniex) went down right when the news broke. price probably won't settle at the new low for at least a day or so while people adjust their algorithms and have the opportunity to buy in/out on other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:42:04
You shouldn't be buying bitcoin. You need to read more about the difference between a bank transfer and a transaction. 
Set up a wallet you control and send your coinbase funds to it. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 20:46:08
awesome, thanks mate
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:02:54
Thaks m8. I was gonna buy BTC for the first time through yhem, buy i think i'll look elsewhere now
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:44:44
I'm in the middle of diving neck deep into BTC. What is the end goal? If you're busy, some key words or an article will suffice.
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:51:06
But napster and limewire fell. Then TPB. And major private trackers like what.cd. unless I'm mistaken, p2p isn't flourishing like it once was.
@_date: 2017-04-20 11:51:19
What's that from? Cool quote.
@_date: 2017-04-20 11:49:49
Don't worry Obama, Segwit and layer 2 solutions won't be trustless, so you'll be able to find a way to regulate them!
(Not that I think BU is a better scaling solution)
