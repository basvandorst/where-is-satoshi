Timelock period on the channel. The time in which you can act, to prevent being defrauded. Approximately 1 to maybe several days I think is current thinking.
The other solution is big blocks. Which leads do a degree of centralisation but still remains decentralised overall and is vastly simpler and safer. It’s worth noting that running non mining full nodes does not actually protect the network in any way. Running nodes is dirt cheap for an adversary and actually quite impractical for a normal user. Hence we have spv clients on phones. IMHO, a topology of maybe 10,000 massive data centres with a billion users connected via spv is the simplest and safest design. (There is a marginal but solvable privacy concern also. But note bip37 doesn’t protect your privacy anyway, and onion routing could alleviate most concerns).
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:10:49
And all you’ll need to do is either ensure you’re running your own system with guaranteed uptime and your private key on it, or give your private keys to a party that will!

Wow. You really don’t know how lightning works do you? Keep on shillin’.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:23:04
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:04:36
I guess we could, you know, raise the block size?
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:25:55
Fair enough. Let’s just say you’re ignorant then. For lightning to work, you need to be online all the time, or at least regularly. Find me anyone who’s going to lock up any considerable amount of money, and feel safe that they will be online within the timelock period to protect against theft. It’s stupid to think most people in this world are going to live with that kind of risk. Hence there will be watchers, and watchers to watch the watchers. And watchers to watch those watchers. And the watcher who’s watching your channel for you will need to hold your keys so they can sign against any potential theft. So there you have it. You have to either put the private key on a machine constantly connected to the internet that you take responsibility for, completely destroying cold storage practice (malware anyone?), or give your keys to a watcher, who effectively becomes your bank.
I *suppose* you could spend 100$ a month in fees (yes, with growth that’s where we’ll be), to load 2000$ into your channel, and then live with the risk of your phone being hacked and the keys and thus funds being stolen, plus the risk of ensuring you’re online at least once per day, but this seems pretty crap to me, and will be useless for the 4billion unbanked and economically deprived.
If only, there was some other solution ��
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:41:25
Lightning does use onion routing yes, but onion routing is not exclusive to lightning (a naive example, just use bitcoin over tor to conceal your identity. More advanced, build it into the system). There are also other solutions to privacy on chain such as zksnarks (but still emerging tech).
The take away is this. Lightning network is complex. Hugely complex with many known known concerns and probably more unknown unknowns. 1 billion users, topping up their payment channels, evenly distributed over a month once a month, could get away with something like 32meg blocks and all associated risks with keys, being online, watchers, insurance structures to ensure you can afford to pay the fee to counteract a defraud etc. So you need bigger blocks anyway for this to be remotely viable, and even then there are huge security concerns and it will still be limited to those of us wealthy enough to settle on-chain once a month or so. Or you could adopt a “decentralised enough” big data center topology with spv clients. Which is basically what we have today already, it just needs to keep growing.
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:47:25
The latest. Meaning you need to be online to receive money, to update the watcher, in which case why even have a watcher? You either commit to holding your own keys on an internet facing machine to receive money (with associated risk of hack, of which there will be massive incentive), or you give your keys to a watcher so you can be offline while receiving money. And then you need a watcher to watch your watcher in case your watcher colludes against you. And none of these services will be free.

You know what else would have instantly cleared the backlog and not required the entire ecosystem of exchanges and wallets to adapt to take advantage of a new technology? Increasing the block size to 4meg, like segwit supposedly does.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:04:49
Ridiculous. Bitcoin was a solution to money for today and you’re talking about 100 years? Btc will be left in the dirt if you think like that. Bch neither suggests doing every tiny transaction onchain, nor adopting 100gb blocks in 10 years. It simply increases the block size to 8mb today to keep the network running smoothly today. Bch is not fundamentalist like btc is. We know what works now and we embrace that solution. We also recognise that most users are not running “full nodes” but just spv clients (and due to core, an increasing number just hold on exchanges), and that we can push the block size a lot higher as the vast majority of node runners could support 32m plus.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:50:58
If Core had not spread hardfork fud and had just released a version of software that forked and given everyone 12 months to run it, everyone would have gladly run it. Instead they’ve convinced half world we must never hardfork, ever.

Segwit. The block size increase that required the entire ecosystem to upgrade to use it. Because it was supposed to be optional and so done as a soft fork. Instead of just cleanly hardforking the chain, requiring nothing more than node updates, and getting everyone to adopt. They brought this conflict with their total lack of leadership.  They should have just done 4meg blocks, and spent the time on Schnorr Signatures.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:37:25
Why don’t they just announce when they will increase in the roadmap? They are causing complete chaos in the community, allowing bch to gain ground, and if bch is such a scam coin, allowing people to be scammed. All they need to do is lay out the block size increase clearly in the roadmap and bch would be dead. At this point, I don’t think it’s happening.

There’s what you think and say, and there’s what you actually do. It’s incredibly obvious to everyone that you are being disingenuous. You actually think Bitcoin will go up, and that’s why you’re holding it. But what you’re actually doing is rationalising your current losses. If it goes up, you win. If it goes down you’re psychologically prepared, and can say “see?”. A pyrrhic victory. If you truly believed Bitcoin was going to 4000 in the next 2 weeks why the hell wouldn’t you at least sell now and buy back then to lock in a 30% increase in holdings. Or better, in 2020 for 60%. You can slice this anyway you like, folks that truly believe that something is going down, don’t hold it.

Gods do not exist. Fortunately, engineers do not rely on Gods to tell them how to engineer solutions to problems.
If the word of the guy that created Bitcoin, who's past messages clearly show a vision of increasing block sizes, a vision supported by knowledgeable software engineers even today (including dare I say it myself), for a solution (to a problem that should never have existed) that poses no threat to bitcoin whatsoever, cannot convince you, then you're helpless.
Anyway, this was not meant to be about Satoshi and his vision, but rather about having multiple development teams. My point stands.
@_date: 2016-03-10 00:11:45
You mean, Satoshi's comment in the code about increasing the block size, and the emails that are on record of him talking about how Bitcoin can scale as is, is taking his words out of context?
Do you actually follow what's going on here? I know this subreddit deletes evidence about this stuff but it's not hard to find the information elsewhere.
Not to mention that engineers such as myself, and countless more with closer understanding of Bitcoins internals, can clearly see that increasing the block size poses no systemic risk to Bitcoin at all.
Satoshi would have increased the block size, and if you don't see that then I really can't help you.
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:08:48
No it's not.
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:19:21
I'm saying it provides the original vision. There are no engineers (apart from those with corporate interests) who believe there is any issue with raising the blocksize. There is no blindly being convinced. The block size was always meant to be increased, and there is no, *no* relevant technical argument against it. This has been discussed at length and the only engineers for small blocks are core. There are no respected non core engineers that see any technical reason to
Not increase. The arguments for small blocks is to create a fee market and to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer. It is political/business decision. There is no need for Bitcoin to be a settlement layer. Block stream could easily use a new blockchain for that, but then where do they get their user base? They are hijacking Bitcoin. You are uninformed or naive if you think otherwise.
@_date: 2016-03-10 00:07:51
Nobody is modifying the money. They are modifying the protocol. The block size increase is a technical implementation detail. Do you seem to think it's going to somehow steal your coins?
@_date: 2016-03-10 00:30:46
Here are a few of his words. Please tell me I'm taking him out of context.

Even the most strangled connection can download 2mb in 10 minutes. Thin blocks mean the bandwidth requirements are spread out over the 10 minutes and not a race at completion time.
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:30:43
There is no reason why a single team cannot work under this model of course. There is also nothing stopping anyone from forking the Linux source code, and making changes that still means the system operates perfectly within the Linux ecosystem. There is nothing stopping changes from each project then being pulled into each other, as happens in many opens source projects.
To be against the word "teams" for open source is simply absurd. This is the very essence of open source. To take the code and run with it. The Linux kernel has subsumed code from literally hundreds of other projects developed by different teams over the course of its history.
One noticeable difference between Linux and Bitcoin, is that Linus, the creator of Linux, is the benevolent dictator. If Satoshi were leading the Bitcoin Core team, this would never have been an issue as he would have stuck to his vision of scaling on chain.
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:19:34
Being spread out across the world means it is not physically centralised, but it is still logically centralised. And realistically there are about 2 developers that have commit access to Core, not 50.
Your statement that there can only be one development group, otherwise development "can't go ahead" is patently false. A single group certainly benefits from clear leadership, but you can go ahead with development in multiple groups, and then the market will decide which group dominates. This is demonstrable in countless open source projects which fork the codebase and remain compatible within the ecosystem, and in the wider economy as a whole. In the case of Bitcoin it is more likely that we will see features being pulled in from competing projects as they gain popularity (e.g. thin blocks, header first mining etc). These don't even require hard forks. When it comes to forking each dev team can support the forks they want, and the miners can vote accordingly.
There is no "arrogantly forcing hard forks without consensus". There is an election. In the case of Classic the election requires 75% agreement, which is consensus (definition from dictionary: a ​generally ​accepted ​opinion or ​decision among a ​group of ​people). This is a very conservative election. In politics (between 2 runners) you only need 51% to win, then everyone lives with the new leadership wether they like it or not.
Your approach of *not* hard forking without your idea of consensus (which sounds like it must be almost 100%) is not serving the community, if the majority of the community wants to hard fork. Further, not all hard forks are equal. Bumping the block size as in this debate, is trivial compared to say, changing the PoW, and was always in Satoshi's original vision.
These issues are all solved with elections. You can't have an election with a single runner in the game. There is nothing stopping the Bitcoin community having a clear standardised solution to voting on how the technology evolves, rather than just letting one group of people decide.

I had a goldmoney account and I think I legally owned the gold in the vault. Even if it's an iou there must be a legal obligation to trade a gold iou for gold. The dollar used to be redeemable for gold. Ious are valuable for gold but why anyone would take a bitcoin iou over Bitcoin I don't know. Any fractional reserve currency "backed" by Bitcoin would surely have a different name. Just like tokens backed by eth collateral or not passed off as eth.
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:30:21
Presumably though they can't call it Bitcoin. Just like the dollar isn't called "gold". Unless it were redeemable for precisely the same as 1 on chain Bitcoin, but even then it's an iou and gold ious aren't called gold.

This guy is a genuinely unpleasant person. This is more of the same divisive rhetoric that he's been peddling for years. It's time this community realised there is no "attack" on Bitcoin and there is no "enemy". Bitcoin is an OPEN platform, for anyone to use (despite Mow claiming it's not for the poor), and it's free to be forked and "spammed" and modified by whoever desires. If every time someone forks or modifies Bitcoin everyone starts bleating about attacks and enemies this kind of insane FUD will never end.
Bitcoin as a system can either survive these so called "attacks", or it cannot. It is not up to any one individual or authority to dictate what Bitcoin is. You all need to get that into your heads. Bitcoin will be what Bitcoin will be, and you either roll with it or you don't. By all means enter the debate or contribute code, but this enemy and attack talk is propagandist bullshit, and anyone who loves Bitcoin for the exact reason that it is above power structures should realise this, or wake up to their own hypocrisy.
Your so called "attacks" on Bitcoin, are just other peoples efforts to improve it. And if there are genuine malicious attacks, consider it free security testing. Cut out the bullshit talk and focus on making Bitcoin all it actually can be.

How about you stop experimenting with your flawed progressive ideology on Bitcoin, stop telling me what Bitcoin is, and let it scale as it was always intended to? With bigger blocks on chain. We compromised by agreeing to SegWit in exchange for 2x increase, in the full knowledge that we were putting the trust up front. It wasn't the scaling solution I wanted but I accepted that to keep the community together, and because mature people compromise, and now this sub will do everything it can to renege in the 2x increase.
It's incredible how you manage to perform the mental pretzel of accusing those of us that just want Bitcoin to scale on chain (as it always has done), as being the ones hijacking Bitcoin. But apparently changing it wildly with SegWit to turn it into a settlement layer is just "progress".
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:34:36
And we will never know whether that is due to market demand, or due to transaction drop off from high fees and slow confirmation times. Do you not understand the paradox? It's actually impossible to draw any conclusions as long as we are dragging along the ceiling. If you're so sure that tx demand is so low, then where is the harm in raising the ceiling to a point above the tx volume peak, just as we have from 0 to 1 meg.
But again, it's your double-think isn't it? Can't increase the block size because they'll be full of transactions (how awful...), but at the same time, blocks are not full. Which one is it?
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:13:21
"We" is those of us that want bigger blocks. I don't work for Jihan, but I own a *lot* of hardware manufactured by Bitmain, and I mine as part of a small, exclusive pool.
But here we go again, with people like you accusing people like me of centralizing, when the overwhelming point of centralization in Bitcoin right now is the governance of the software by a team who *do not believe* in Bitcoin as it exists today, and who's very employment and paychecks *depend* on them developing "solutions" to "the problem".
There are dozens of mining pools, consisting of thousands of miners like me, most of us on fibre networks and multi-TB storage systems and the freedom to mine with whomever we please. This has increased year by year after the ASIC plateau, and you have the gall and audacity to say *I'm* the one peddling propaganda?
Core and the people that support them in this sub, are anti-capitalists that would feel right at home with antifa. You believe the system is broken and must be changed. You don't believe in the market and free competition. You have spun lies about the importance of running "non-mining full nodes". Dirt cheap systems with no economic incentives behind them that provide zero protection, all under the guise that "the miners are centralizing". That we're the ones attacking Bitcoin! It's staggering. Many of you even wanted to have your own little "revolution" with UASF (and you may still if 2x happens).
It's *us* that provide you with the security, not your useless network of nothing nodes. You can't fire us! The notion is hilarious! But we compete with one another. There are more and more of us as Bitcoin grows, fighting to the death for that reward while you lot sit around calling for revolution or over-engineering complicated solutions to problems that don't exist.
I'm sitting on a 10gbit internet backbone. I have 100's of TB's of storage available to me at little cost. I'm ready to serve the world. I can destroy visa level transactions *today*. I'm a small mining outfit, and I don't know of any others who aren't in a similar situation. If one of my competitors gets pushed off the network because they didn't have the gumption to mine on a decent fibre line, *good*. Survival of the fittest my friend. I don't need your malleability fix. I don't need your lightning network. I don't need your side-chains. I don't need your block weight. I'll take a quadratic hash time fix (although I'm pretty indifferent) and a block size increase but other than that Bitcoin has everything it needs to deliver to the world what it promised. A global, peer-to-peer electronic cash system of sovereign money. Real money, borderless, open and trustless.
2x is the last chance to not split Bitcoin completely in two. It will demonstrate the total safety of a hardfork block size increase, nullifying years of FUD from this sub, and paving the way for future increases. Hopefully certain Core members will stick to their word and rage quit.
Your handle is very fitting.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:20:27
The onus is on you to demonstrate why we need a fee market set by a block size cap, as opposed to orphan rate. But in 3 years no one has been able to answer, so instead the argument will switch to one about "centralisation", and when that's disproven it'll move to an argument around "unlimited block space demand", and when that's disproven it'll move to an argument about "safety" and when that's disproven it'll move to an argument about "goat herders need full nodes too", and when that's disproven it'll move to "spv fraud proofs are inadequate" and when that's disproven it'll move to "asic boost" and when that's disproven it'll move to some ideological bullshit about "power to the people" and "fire the miners".

@_date: 2017-07-22 11:58:10
Perhaps, you are right. I certainly hope you are. I am extremely skeptical that this debate is "coming to a conclusion". If 2x fork happens without lukejr, greg, and the rest of this sub trying to prevent it, then I stand corrected. This is time for the small block side to be mature, and agree that a 2mb fork is the next right move.
I think you will see my skepticism is not misguided however.
edit: I'll just add that I've already seen comments from greg telling the community not to support 2x. Followed by posts like this, I think you can see why I feel the way I do.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:28:44
No sir, it is you that is the hypocrite. In case you're not aware, miners are not in Bitcoin just for the money. They are in Bitcoin because they love Bitcoin. The same reason that anyone that starts a business, usually starts something they're passionate about. On the other hand, I bet you contribute absolutely nothing to this project. Maybe you should reflect on that, on your actual value to this system.
If you care about Bitcoin, you better get behind 2x, and not support rubbish about avoiding the fork because it's "dangerous" or leads to "centralisation". If miners wanted higher fees, we would want small blocks wouldn't we? If we wanted to destroy Bitcoin, we would want to centralise it as much as possible wouldn't we? And yet, these are the cases put forward in this sub for never by any means increasing the blocksize. It's delusional.
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:52:28
Blah blah blah, Jihan. Blah blah blah hostile takeover.
You're delusional. Completely brainwashed.
The stories I'm telling you are real world stories. You live in your fantasy world of centralised miners, conspiracy theories, and fear. It's a classic move of how to control the masses and retain power, fill them with fear. I pity you frankly. You completely fail to address the fact I'm telling you I can scale to visa levels today, and you just role out the same old trope. It's honestly sad. I would laugh if you hadn't wrecked the community.
I bet you cannot accurately answer one simple question. What would happen to bitcoin if the block cap were removed today? Go on, I've got time. You can muster up your most apocalyptic scenarios, spam attacks, centralisation, whatever. I will systematically destroy any argument you make. Bring it (you won't because you're a coward with no argument).
Watch what happens when you lot block 2x. You'll ultimately be left in the dust. And while we begin to scale massively on chain, and more and more miners are coming online to fight over the ever increasing price (as they always have), you'll cry about centralization because you can no longer run a "full node" on your shitty hardware. And nobody will care, because Bitcoin will have finally, delivered.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:12:46
Because all I ever read about in this sub is "fire the miners". "Miners only want money". "Bitmain is centralising control". "The best solution now is to run BIP148 code only" (reneging on any block size increase). The hypocrisy and complete upside down thinking is what makes me angry. I've spent years in Bitcoin, and years following this debate, and just as there is progress that could keep us all moving forward together without killing each other, I see that this sub is walking away from 2x (which Core has disgustingly never supported either).
You wonder why I'm angry? Are you new here?
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:06:16
Remarkably, the same way the rest of the world would benefit. With wider adoption. The same way the rest of the community would benefit, with higher prices, and the same way miners have always benefited, with an increase in earned transaction fees that comes from *increased tx volume*, and not an artificial fee market.

Bitcoin scaled from 0meg on chain, to 1meg on chain. I just want it to continue. If that makes me some kind of lunatic, so be it. But small blockers have not demonstrated any good reason to not scale on chain, other than that they want a fee market. Lightning network, side-chains, all perfectly possible with an increased block size and appropriate malleability fixes, but you know what wouldn't be present? A high fee market, and the company that offers the "solution".

What a sanctimonious, brown nosing, hypocritical, and divisive post. This offers nothing of value.

The same commie trope I've got used to hearing from people like you. "Just in it for the money" is the same crap commie antifa crowds spew about those people who actually build society by offering people what they want, in exchange for money. You know, what has made our civilisation actually work. How about you stop supporting the miners you hate so much, by voting with your feet and moving to an altcoin?
Bitcoin will split, it won't be the miners fault, and the market will decide which chain works best. I just think it's sad that because of the anti-miner propaganda in this sub, it's come to this.

Ethereum is not Solidity, anymore than your computer is Java. Functional languages will be adapted to compile to evm bytecode. Takes time. It's early. This was a good first step.
