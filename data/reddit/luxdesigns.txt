What makes you think Snowden is no longer a citizen? (He is.)
 
Furthermore, Snowden's actions took place before this executive order was issued. You can't go after someone for what they did in the past on the basis of a new rule or regulation.
Even then, Snowden himself did not release these documents online. He gave them to journalists who did that. This is an order centered around cyberespionage, cybersabotage, etc.

If you can't find where it dismisses the assertions made up above I can't help you.
 
I simply can't help you with reading comprehension issues over the internet.

OP left out Section I, which is important because it undermines the assertion by OP.. (bold emphasis added)














































You'll notice this is about cybercrime and cyberespionage. Nowhere does it say anything about what Edward Snowden did (and no, you one nitpicky a-hole that will argue he committed cybercrime, he is not wanted for cybercrime).
This order, of course, has no effect on constitutionally protected free speech.
Everyone relax.

You know what's even more hilarious? Your tenuous grasp of the law.

Well, I'm not calling you an idiot, but that doesn't mean you aren't.
