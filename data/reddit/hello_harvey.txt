Hello, Everyone!
this might be inappropriate but I would like to give it a try. 
My name is Harvey and I am a current university student studying computer science reaching out to the community for help. This year has definitely been a volatile year for me, unfortunately, filled with more downs than up. After my father got laid off of his job due to sickness, a lot of strain was placed on both my family and I. Being an international student, I am unable to work in the United States with a student visa which has put me in a situation where I am dependent on my parents.
Proceeding the events of father’s work situation, I made an effort to find alternative ways to try and lessen the load on my parents and find methods in which I could earn money while keeping within the bounds of the restrictions placed by the student visa. That is how I originally got introduced to trading equities and cryptocurrencies. As I did my due diligence on why the cryptocurrency markets were catching on, I had learned about blockchain technology. As I study more, I can see how this technology will change both the economy and the way a lot of our current web infrastructures are formed.
With this being said, I am asking the community if there are those who can feel my passion and purpose and is willing to invest in my future. I am extremely positive that things will turn out for the better and I know there are select few that will mutually see my vision and help me during my time of misfortune. 
Below is my BTC address, and I can not thank you enough for reading and considering my request. 
Even just a bit would mean a lot to me. Once again, Thank you very much and I wish all Happy early Christmas.
