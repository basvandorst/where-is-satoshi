That doesn't mean that the pool is in for a drought or can expect to experience more bad luck than usual. It could get even luckier from here and then have average luck for so long that the ratio approaches the expected -- all without experiencing any bad luck.
A statement something like "Conditioned on the first five hundred blocks having a luck statistic of 0.91, the probability of the next five hundred blocks having a luck statistic of greater than one is greater than the probability of the next five hundred blocks having a luck statistic of less than one" is true and probably more in line with what you were intuiting.
It's a headfuck.
@_date: 2016-04-07 12:09:17
That's not how luck works. Every block solved has the same possible luck statistic as every other block. The process is [memoryless]( - good luck in the past is no guarantee of any kind of luck in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:09:31
Even easier - if miners keep track of their winning block hashes, then they can just look them up on blockexplorer or blockchain.info and see if they have the same generation address and/or coinbase signature as other blocks solved by the pool.

If anyone was recording IP addresses back then and Satoshi wasn't using tor or a VPN, then yes, someone could have found his IP address if they were connected to the majority of the network at the time.
However, I don't think anyone did.
@_date: 2014-08-16 05:26:07
1. Yes, interesting, huh?
2. I don't know why he's using restricted nonces at all, so I can't say.
3. So the LSB can't be relied upon. The change in extra nonce over time is a much better 'finger print' than the nonce LSB.
My theory? I don't even have a working hypothesis. I like some of the suggestions readers have provided but none account for all the results in a meaningful way.
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:23:34
My aim in researching centraliation measures is to prepare for the time when there will be no more pooled mining - just large solo mining farms. this is bound to happen, since it's generally more profitable to mine than to advertise, sell, and deliver chip and ASIC miners. If this happens,  centralisation measures will become increasingly important.
The reason I think there have been very few cases of malfeasance among the very large block creators is not so much that they're all angels but that complex cryptocurrency scams are just not part of the core competencies and interests of mining farm technologists.
(thanks for the link to your post, interesting so far)
@_date: 2014-05-30 07:21:30


Wow, that's huge! 180 000 remote miners is way more than any other pool - even BTC Guild (half the hashrate of GHash.IO) has only 9 803 miners (1/20 of the miners of GHash.IO) . Do you have a source for your data?


Probably not. 40% of the network is contributed by 21688 miners (including companies such as Megabigpower). You really think that the remaining 60% is contributed by 480 000 miners? Why the huge disparity in average hashrate between the two groups?


I'm pretty sure I didn't quote him anywhere in the post?
@_date: 2014-01-14 07:42:58
The blocks the OP is concerned about don't belong to GHash.io, but Discus Fish. Are you suggesting Discus Fish used those blocks to commit a double spend?
@_date: 2014-08-23 02:14:04
I concur.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:34:55
Don't get me wrong - I do see the potential in what you suggest. I just don't know how to even start generalising it so graphs could be created by miners with out specialist knowledge.


I guess I got burned the last time I asked for data from the community - it was a survey of miners. I used google forms and made it public. I ended up with so much vandalism, fake data and misinformation in the spreadsheet that after spending weeks trying to sort it out I gave it up as unuseable. This has turned me off relying on anything other than primary data sources.

It's a bit hacky for a solution that requires fine grained control, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:54:56
Unfortunately that relies on the miners to be honest and also relies on representatives of a dishonest mining pool not faking results to cause confusion.
@_date: 2014-10-09 08:58:09
Sure. I've done that previously (before ASICs and during the beginning of the 'ASIC age') and I'll probably do it again (modified as per your suggestion), but right now I'm most interested in forecasting difficulty/network hashrate.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:25:15
Why do you think location of nodes must correlate with location of transaction producers? People creating txs may have a number of node to help tx propagation, but I don't think node locations correlating with active times explains anything.
Or maybe I just don't want to let go of my mystery just yet ;)
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:00:16
I remember this time of which you speak. It was 2009 and 2010, right? 
Because from early 2011 onward, the problems with bitcoin's anonymity were fairly well described in several research papers.
What I've done is nothing new, and was not at a particularly advanced level. If you're concerned about what I've done here, you can be sure there's someone who can do a much better job and is not reporting his or her findings to the community.
@_date: 2014-10-02 10:25:42
Yes. Slush too. The largest words (most frequent) are the most boring. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:41:00


But not necessarily with tx processors and other bitcoin businesses which (I think) create more txs than individuals.


Maybe. I don't think you can assume that though. I think it just shows where the location of the majority of transaction creators are. These might be individuals but are more likely to be bitcoin related businesses and transaction processors.
I guess the next step would be to look for signature addresses and create a time series of their appearances.

I also found it interesting that although the daily tx cycle has been there since 2011 (although it's hidden for a while when Satoshi Dice spam started) the weekly tx cycle is more recent and sudden. Any ideas why?

@_date: 2014-08-16 02:53:41
If he was using one instance of a miner per LSB used, then:
1. If he was using one computer per miner we would expect his hashrate to be much higher than it was. 
2. If using multiple threads, then why use so many client instances?
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:01:53
That's my main reason, yes. I want to make sure that unknown sources of hashes are not affiliated with other known hash contributors.
But after spending so much time on it now, finding the address owner is also just sheer bloody mindedness.

Unfortunately that was the week that bitcoin was slashdotted and MTGOX started trading. Difficulty increased by 4 times during just one retarget. If he'd started a couple of weeks earlier it would have been easy, but as it is it's hard to know just how much of the network is him, and how much are new miners attracted by slashdot and an easy way to trade coins for USD. 
Great idea to look at testnet btw. If I *can* figure this out, I'd say that would be the way to do it.

Dynamic linear models rely on lag. I did mention your points in the post. I did also plot diff(hashrate) and diff(price) - that's what the CCF assesses. There is currently no linear lagged relationship between price and hashrate. There may be a non-linear relationship due to the stochastic delivery process, but not a useful predictive relationship.

@_date: 2014-03-18 02:04:48
I wasn't being sarcastic, just sensible. There's no way anyone could gather the data from hundreds of miners and at the same time be certain of the veracity of each claim. 
If you're suggesting that each miner could do this themselves using some sort of analysis tool, that's also possible. However the scripts I wrote were specifically for this purpose and wouldn't be suitable for your suggestion. Instead, interested miners could use  which is a bit more user friendly than R.
Finally, if you're actually after an algorithm, as you mention, I think that would depend on what the miner wanted to know? I'm just a beginner at this so I'm not sure where to point people for help. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 08:08:12
Possibly true but unfortunately not easily provable, and even though you've reduced the number of variables it's still probably too complex from a forecasting point-of-view. 
I think using autoregressive models for short term (up to ~8 week) forecasts are probably going to be most simple and reliable, but I would be very happy to be shown to be wrong!
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:23:41

This is not a "one transaction per user" system. However unlikely, it could be possible that the majority of txs are from just one payment processor and not indicate anything about actual users.

Hmmm. "Against bitcoin?". No.
If what I did was disallowed by the protocol, then by definition it couldn't be done.
"Bitcoin was not made for you to know to whom that address belongs to.". You're right there. Bitcoin was made to be a cryptocurrency. It doesn't care at all what my hobbies are.
If I can do this in my spare time as a hobby (in order to find, amongst other things, cheaty ASIC companies) then you can be absolutely certain that someone much smarter than I can do much more in much less time.
Maybe you should consider this a lesson in what bitcoin's anonymity *is*, rather than what you would like it to be.

@_date: 2014-03-17 10:21:19
Then why care about it at all? 
If you're not concerned about a 51% attack, then just knowing that an "unknown" is already a going concern mean theres a good chance "unknown" will continue long term, which can help with future difficulty estimates.
I'd also like to untangle some of the weird connections and see what sort of relationships these businesses have with each other. 
Lastly, I want to reduce the "Unknown" percentage on my pie chart. 7.5% "Unknown" scares people. It also looks untidy :)

1. Absolutely sure his average daily hashrate was below 4.5 Mhps at best. For the first year the hashrate for the entire network was below 7Mhps.
2. If he spread the LSB around, why not spread it more widely rather than less widely? 
3. Blocks with nonce LSBs in the restricted range does not provably show them as belonging to Satoshi, however blocks that do not have nonce LSBs in the restricted range probably don't belong to him.

@_date: 2016-01-24 23:28:48
Thanks, but unfortunately the public pools with private hashing farms  don't make public the percentage of the pool that is owned *by* the pool. This makes the data unaccurate, but I'm not sure exactly how inaccurate.
@_date: 2016-03-05 10:44:07
That's what I thought too. The interesting part - and the thing I didn't consider the first time around - is how many miners use a different block size maximum. The current size maxima seem to be 750kB, 950kB and 1000kB, but in 2014 and 2015 they were spread across the range from 250 to 1000 kB.
Since tx costs increase only for those block sizes, not including this into transaction fee / block size analyses made previous models and inferences less accurate.
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:14:56

"None of the measures suggest *a long term increase* in centralisation over time; the Gini coefficient and Theil index both indicate a decrease in centralisation since the start of the year."

@_date: 2015-08-27 23:06:15
I understand your points, but I wasn't focussing on the fairness of the supermajority size, more that the flaws - or oversights if you prefer - are easily fixable.
Even if there's no desire to change the supermajority size, changing the rate at which validation occurs and defining an end-date to the proposal would both go a long way to preventing variance from having a significant effect on results.
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:16:01
Hey Peter, thanks. 
I like the way you phrased that, and your statement is true theoretically (if we could time extend out toward infinity), but otherwise I'm not sure I'd state it that forcefully - there are limits. 
For example it would take about 2x10^55 years (at 1008 blocks per week) for a true proportion of 0.5 to have a 0.01% chance of activating BIP101.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:03:13
It make it much easier for those faking BIP101 votes to activate BIP101 without a majority supporting it. A couple of small mining pools - or one large one - could do it.
@_date: 2015-08-28 02:51:04
Can you explain exactly how that will cause a problem in this case? What I mean is, for example, do you think the number of BIP101 blocks per 1,000 won't be described by a binomial distribution?
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:27:23
Some obvious flaws that need to be addressed.
@_date: 2015-08-27 23:07:39
Coincidence? I think not! :)
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:30:22
The suggested 95% arises because not only is a majority, but the confidence intervals are much tighter - the 89% figure you mention has a 1 in ten million chance of creating 950 of a thousand sequential blocks, after one hundred thousand attempts. 93.5% has a 9 percent chance of succeeding after a couple of years. From a purely statistical point of view, 95% majority is more reliable. What have been the supermajorities required for other BIPs?
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:03:47
If anyone knew which pools then they wouldn't be faking.
Faking means they're visibly saying they are Bitcoin XT clients, but if the supermajority is achieved they won't activate. If we knew which pools were going to do that, they wouldn't be able to fake. Any block maker that has their version number set to indicate they are voting for BIP101 could be suspect.
As to the why, who knows? Maybe an axe to grind? The "Not Bitcoin XT" software is easily available, so the use friction is low.
@_date: 2015-07-05 12:42:54
The prospectus is recent (lodgement date 29th June 2015), but they make the claim: 
"Bitcoin Group is an Australian based pureplay Bitcoin Mining operator, currently producing approximately 1.45% of the global mining output, by operating 5.3 petahashes of mining hardware in seven mining sites across China, Iceland and Australia."
I cant find any block maker that this could be, all accounted for. They could be renting machines from eg. Bitfury I guess. Unless they provide full disclosure of the blocks they've solved, I would be sceptical.
@_date: 2015-08-28 03:28:20
I think I understand: you're not saying that the BIP101 votes distribution *won't be* will be binomially distributed, just that the distribution of the *next* result conditioned on the last result won't be binomially distributed?
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:59:35
I think a point more important to consider is reducing the number of times the voting is checked. The more times you validate, more more likely a type II error is to occur. Tallying votes once per retarget is a better solution and would make changing the supermajority percentage much less important.


That's another point - the voting is open ended. Nothing in the BIP explicitly mentions a close of voting. It could drag on for a while if the anti and pro BIP101 camps are evenly matched.
@_date: 2015-08-23 07:29:53
It depends on what time period you're interested in. Over very short time periods, yes. Over a day or so, no. 
What you're really interested in is the mean block rate function, and no block maker has had a mean function approaching 50% of the network block rate function.

My summary really only applies to the data set I was working with - recent history, 2014 onward. Sorry if I didn't make that clear in the summary, but it's mentioned in the analysis.
I'm not really getting the "transaction fee" vs "fee" comment. Can your explain further? 
Edit: Is it just that I'm not defining "tx fee market" properly?

No, it's all denominated in btc.
@_date: 2015-04-25 02:23:10
Probably. However it's not a hard analysis to perform, so I hope someone will replicate my results at some point in the future.
Edit: A point I didn't make in the post is that the centralisation metric has limits of 0 and 1, but price and hashrate have no upper limit so it's not unlikely at some point that price and/or hashrate will move outside the range of the modelled inputs.

It's an interesting idea. It has an improvements (a deadline for voting to finish) but I don't know enough about it from what's written on  to be sure if it's an improvement statistically - which is really what the post is about.

Maybe not, but this method of determining a supermajority has been used in the past and will be used again in the future, and to my knowledge no one has ever mentioned confidence intervals for the estimate.

For context, this is what I wrote in the actual post:
"Chinese pools control more than half the network.
To be exact, pools identifying as Chinese contributed 52.8% of the networks blocks, with a 95% confidence interval of  approximately +/- 8.5%. The top four pools are all Chinese. This shouldn't be surprising, since most (all?) bitcoin mining chips are fabricated there and much of the development appears to be Chinese as well.
My concern with this development is the same as if that much of the network was concentrated in any nation - what happens to the network if the government decides to take an interest? Some pools have some of their equipment outside China, but even so that still leave a large proportion of the network that could be controlled by one government.
I'm sure the Chinese pools are aware of this and have strategies in place to mitigate this risk, and I'd encourage them to start moving at least some infrastructure to other countries."

I don't know. I'll look at my dataset later on and see. Unless have a handy and more recent list of block announce times you can email me? 




I think you might be on to something there. It might also be possible to determine the extent of the effect by just by subtracting some number of seconds from the inter-block latencies and then checking to see if those altered latencies are exponentially distributed. You could optimise the problem by optimising the Anderson Darling statistic for the distribution of altered latencies.
@_date: 2015-02-09 12:48:39
One way to approach this is to find a likely intensity function (eg by using some sort of smoother) and use the method described by [Frenkel, Gertsbakh and Khvatskin]( to determine how the data is distributed given the intensity function. If it's not distributed as expected, change some smoother variables and try again.
Problems with this method:
1. You need accurate block arrival times, not time stamps.
2. Even so, when the network hashrate is stable there are still far fewer short round than expected and so data does not fit with an exponential distribution.
These points are not deal killers, but did confuse hell out of me when I was first trying to determine intensity functions.
@_date: 2015-02-21 09:34:04

@_date: 2013-03-25 15:56:36
I guess that about 10 to 15 Thps are GPUs. It's hard to know when they'll stop mining since that depends on the exchange rate which is much higher than anyone estimated a few months ago.

Thanks for confirming - I hadn't heard of any such either.
@_date: 2013-07-14 12:55:51
I agree. Correlation != causation.
It's suggestive though, and I thought that if I posted it here someone might know of a relationship between them. It might be complete coincidence, or maybe not and ASICMiner investors are being paid. Or not.
However, if DiscusFish has bought hardware from ASICMiner there'd be no correlation in hashrate - ASICMiner was mining a long time before it went solo - and they both started to sign the coinbase at the same time.
I'll keep doing weekly updates until it no longer looks like there's a relationship or someone explains what it is.
@_date: 2013-01-27 16:30:11
I don't think that would be as clear as you think. One graph with two lines and two very different scales should be on different charts, imo. But I get what you mean. I'll try a few things in the morning, and see what sort of correlation there is.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:44:45
If that were the case, the network hashrate would have been higher before ASICs arrived. The network was only 20 - 25 Ghps without ASICs and I don't think it was all GPU.

I don't have faith in BFL - I don't know what to expect. My assumptions could be way out - they're just a way of showing you what could happen to the best of my knowledge.
I do think the most recent Avalons were overpriced, and making an ROI is not a given. The exchange rate is also unknown, and whether you make your ROI will depend on whether you're looking for an ROI in USD or BTC .

Say for example the daily earnings drops by 1/3 every month after July. In June, it will earn 32 btc. In July, 10.7 btc, in August, 3.6 btc and then in September, 1.2 btc.  
Total earned by September = ~48 btc. 
Cost of Avalon: 75 btc.
So the Avalon will ave only returned 64% of its btc cost, and in this scenario unlikely to return make a complete ROI.

Ooops, you're right - I meant 2/3.
The point is though that the decrease in earnings is more like a geometric progression than an arithmetic one, so if you want a simple way to estimate earnings, think about reducing them by a constant percentage.

This is why my post is btc denominated. It's up to the reader to decide if they want to try to include the fiat cost of electricity, and to determine what they think the likely exchange rate will be. 
For my own purposes, I just use the btc returns and check that difficulty is less than the level at which I would be mining at a loss.

@_date: 2013-07-15 09:05:20
I thought of a reason a pool would want to but hashes for a small percent over the going rate - to reduce variance. Miners often avoid smaller pools because the variance in earnings can be a problem. If the cost of the hash was low enough - say 101% - then this could be passed on to miners who would benefit from reduced earnings variance.
Of course I'm not saying this is the case, but it is a valid use case for a pool buying/renting (I have no idea what the correct term is) hashes or leasing equipment for more than the cost of a hash.

From the post:
"You will have two weeks to withdraw the first half of your balances. After the two weeks, you will be able to withdraw the remaining half of your balance. After that, for those who didn't withdraw in the first two weeks will be able to withdraw their remaining balance. As the pool balances reaches zero I will import the 1MtRed account and pay off remain withdraws with that."

@_date: 2013-06-10 11:46:52
Do you disagree with a specific point? For the hashrate groups I analysed, it certainly seemed to be the case that the majority of the increase was not due to increased GPUs, and I don't think anyone is buying bulk fpgas atm.

@_date: 2013-10-11 01:49:09
What you've noticed *has* happened a few times. But it's exaggerated because of the increase in variance as hashrate increases. If you look at the drops on a log-linear scale, they're much less impressive.
I did a bit of an analysis on this, but it hasn't happened often enough for me to come to any conclusions. It might be happening due to someone planning it, or it might be confirmation bias.
If it starts happening more regularly, I'll have another tilt at it.

Another thing to consider is I'm not estimating the loss in network hashrate due to GPU miners leaving, which will be a fair chunk of 20Thps.
@_date: 2013-03-27 06:48:15
All those hashes come from:
1. 900 Avalons at 67 Ghps
2. An estimated 250 Avalons at 67 Ghps and 250 at 85 Ghps
3. 12 Thps plus another 50 Thps in April from ASICMiner
4. an average of 2 Thps per day shipped from BFL after April 30th.
If you have more accurate figures, please post them and I'll update my blog.

... and they're all listed under "Assumptions" :) They are the best estimates available, and if you want to work out if buying and running an ASIC is profitable, you have to make some assumptions about delivery times.
You can compare the results to [those I've done previously]( - because delivery schedules haven't been kept by some manufacturers, previous estimates resulted in a higher hashrate and difficulty than actually occurred.
@_date: 2013-06-20 15:29:38

@_date: 2013-02-03 02:54:31
Good points. Do you have a link to Asicminers proposed release schedule? I had a quick lazy look but couldn't find what I was after. 
As for BFL selling their ASICs off books, I'm going to say the total hashrate added per day includes that, since the figure is a pretty much a guess anyway. 
We know Avalon will sell some ASICs to owners of their FPGAs, and these sales are in addition to the known sales. I have no simple way of estimating this and I'd say it will be much larger than any "friends and family" ASICs they send out.
I'll redo the charts soon, since I've had requests from Caifornians and Europeans to include US$0.30 and 0.35 / kWh costs, so I'll include the earnings per time period as well. Keep in mind it's not really a net profit since i'm not ocnsidering the cost of the device, hence the term "earnings".
 This chart *does* take into account batch 3. Look under the "Assumptions" heading.

Your earnings estimate is very close to my result (a dataframe here if you can't read from the chart]( I get a cumulative total of 0.4855 btc per Ghps if you start mining on May 31st and finish on July 1st. So your maths is fine.
What you're getting wrong is that you're forgetting further difficulty increases. I don't know what they'll be so I haven't modelled them, but there is likely to be a continuation of an increase in the network hashrate and so difficulty will increase - and miner earnings will decrease further. [Check the "BTC earnings per day" chart]( to get an idea of how the daily earnings have decreased so far and how much further I think they'll decrease.

That depend on when BFL delivers, how many Thps they can deliver per day, what your electricity cost is, and when the Avalon unit is delivered. Batch 2 Avalons should see a complete return on their investment in most scenarios.

As the reward halves and in the absense of further mining devlopments, the network hashrate (and Difficulty ) will only reduce if the US$/BTC price doesn't increase in response to the reduction in supply. But you're right about Difficulty being a self-limiting feedback loop - that's exactly what it's for.

Maybe. I certainly hope so. I'll update the results weekly and see what happens.

You'll need to talk to blogger about that. No doubt they've written a Javascript exploit specifically targeted at you.

Glad you found it helpful. This is something I probably wouldn't have thought of if it hadn't been requested. There might be a better solution than mine - I couldn't come up with one though.
