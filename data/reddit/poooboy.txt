I run windows 7, MSE, Malaware Bytes.  I have never had a virus, trojan, keylogger.  I've had a wallet for 1 year, it has never been compromised.  
Is all the talk about paper wallets, cold storage, DON"T USE WINDOWS, etc real or more fear mongering?
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:24:36
Thanks again.

There is no bailout built into bitcoin, but that doesn't keep humans from meddling.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:06:01
Can't they outlaw exchanges?  Make it taxable like a commodity?  Dive it so far underground that nobody can use it?  Goldbugs have physical, but it's just sitting there, unused.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:05:55
I don't know.  If BTC-E or Bitstamp lagged out would the price have crashed?  I think Mt Gox is still the big cheese.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:04:08
AlanX you seem to know a lot about BTC. In you opinion what is the tipping point that leads to wide adoption that is discussed here?  Do you think it will be gradual, punctuated, something else?  Also, i still feels like a penny stock with capitalization to match.  When will the chart stop behaving like a stock?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:48
It will be stronger when there are well formed plans to address days when volatility reaches "CRASH" levels.  Halt trading for an hour, close the exchange.  Every other market does this.
Also we need to be able to easily short BTC.  The existing options are too illiquid.
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:36:34
This looks like is a continuation pattern, or a bull flag (bullish wedge).  Target of about 220.   We already have 5 points on the triangle, so breakout is imminent.
Notice the other world markets are at critical levels too.  Nikkei crashed, JGB crashed, SPX may have just triple topped.  
Don't be surprised by a big move in BTC soon.  I just hope it is not down.

Thank you

Given the projections I have read on this sub, like capturing 10 percent of online transactions or more, how is Bitcoin supposed to scale so we have fast confirmations?
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:22:31
This [pic]( shows the continuation pattern.  Usually the breakout target is roughly equivalent of  the length of the pole that the flag is attached to (about 100 dollars).
Of course our markets (broad indices) have been very difficult to trade with basic Technical Anaylsis.  Traders attribute that to too many bots.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:24:29
I just wonder how I can short this when it cracks.  This [chart]( looks exactly like AAPL, Q's, CMG, and many other speculative [blow off tops (NDX red, AAPL black).](
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:56:57
I don't think they will really do it at all, but now that the market is much larger than past "crashes" itmay take measures like this to stabilize it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:34:13
That is very wishful thinking
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:29:13
Somebody filled on Mt Gox at 105.  I suspect that order was placed well before the market price came close.  So if you have some dry powder, why not place a few limit orders at prices that would be unthinkable and that you would be comfortable holding for a few days.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:27:00
In any other market/vehicle/stock/commodity there would have been a halt to trading or the exchange would have closed with this kind of volatility.  Mt Gox, being the biggest, should have stopped trading hours ago, or at least have a policy in place for extreme volatility.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:25:11
Thanks, that was a pragmatic response.
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:51:23
Thank you for your elegant and lapidary disposition on obscure applied quant trading, but your price goal of $420 is far far to low for this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:04:22
One more day of selling like yesterday and they will have to trot out Bill Gates to back BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:23:06
Thank you, I'll take a closer look.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:45:15
Not at all.  Some retirement accounts have rules that do not allow short positions though, but that's not what were talking about with BTC.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:53:47
Any way to short BTC that can be bought/sold quickly.  Shorting allows for more efficient price discovery.

As a run began on the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to liquidate the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money would be needed to keep it solvent through the following day. **That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day.**[35] On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks.[36] John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in America, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank.[36] Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. **To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain America's credit**

I agree completely.  Speculators have turned this into a freakshow.  I want BTC to stabilize and get boring again so we can reliably engage in commerce.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:01:01
I don't see how anybody can say what the price is until volume comes back to the market.
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:50:37
How is it possible to go up against the Central Bank System that has been unopposed for centuries?  They are ruthless, underestimated, and their resources are still unknown.  They will do anything to keep power over commerce and finance.
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:53:53
TA is all about human behavior man, where you been?  It's muddied now by all the algo trading, or at least that's what many traders are complaining about since 2008 or so.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:59:12
It would put a floor in.  Just like Morgan et al did in 1907, and the Federal take down of Freddie/Fannie with susequent coordinated Central Bank response to the credit crisis of 2007.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:09:47
It is in their interest to have a well functioning market.  If confidence in BTC is eroded past a certain threshold there goes their business.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:02:33
I don't think t hey can do it.  They are rich in BTC, not cash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:33
Lucrative until you wake up to lock limit down. Oh wait, no such time outs on Mt Gox.
BTW, we need a liquid shorting vehicle for BTC pronto. That would greatly contribute to the health of the exchanges and market.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:25:35
People are buying because the SPX may have just broken out instead of triple topping.  Others are selling because head fakes happen at these levels frequently.  No doubt about it though, this is an important technical level.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:12:33
Right now is a very sensitive time for BTC.  Some capital deployed strategically could increase confidence in the market.  Was yesterday just a fluke, or the start of the end?  That narrative could be constructed before Mt Gox reopens.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:05:30
This doesn't seem like resilience in the market at all.  It seems like panic selling into a blind dysfunctional exchange.  Where is the volume?  Where is the price?  BTC is down &gt;46% from the peak as I type this. IF it recovers how much damage is done.  How many people had bad newbie market order fills?  
During the flash crash in 2010 many "bad trades" were reversed or nullified. That is not going to happen here, nor should it.  
Edit: It's sad really.  You can see 10 and 20 BTC orders going through that are 40 dollars off market probably from lag.  Hopefully this gets the speculators to think twice next time.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:15:30
icbit.se offers futures.  
This was pointed out to me in another thread when I asked about shorting BTC.  I am not sure how liquid those contracts are though, so if you do sell, plan to hold them to maturation.
@_date: 2013-05-23 23:14:07
Ah, a non-believer.  Well good trading to you.
Signed, an old chart hugger.

Maybe, as a safe haven trade. But if Japan bonds really do implode BTC price is going to be the least of everybody's worries.
That would be loss of confidence in the Japanese Sovereign Debt, a bond market dislocation, basically a Holy Event.
