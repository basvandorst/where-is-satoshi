You aren't being "double taxed" though. It's like any other money. If I give you 10 bucks as compensation and you invest it, then you pay tax on the 10 bucks and then are taxed on any investment gains you make from investing. 
Same deal with Bitcoin. I give you 10 bucks worth of Bitcoin and by not cashing out immediately you are investing it. So you pay tax on the 10 bucks worth of Bitcoin and then if it grows 5x in value and you sell it for 50 bucks, then you pay capital gains tax on the 40 increase.

I would think you would pay ordinary income tax rates on the value of the compensation at the time of payment and then capital gains tax rates on the growth from that point until you sell it. 
Depending on who paid you in Bitcoin in the first place you would likely be issued a W-2 or 1099 showing the value of compensation received. If it wasn't an employer or someone you contracted with and you were just paid under the table, then you would have to just come up with the value at date of payment, which you would know because it's how much they agreed to pay you ("I'll pay you $500 in Bitcoin to do x,y, and z").
Just a guess though and it is probably more complicated than that because the IRS is a terrible place full of very unhappy people. I've not researched this or had it pop up in practice.

Technically I believe you would still be subject to tax on the entire picture similar to my Bitcoin example. Whether or not someone is reporting foreign currency exchange gains properly (or at all) is a different discussion. 
In your example using Euro, you would be taxed on the value in USD on the date you received the Euro. Then if you held on to the Euro and ended up exchanging it for USD at a gain later on, you would then pay tax on the gain.
Again, maybe someone with more individual income tax experience could weigh in and let us know if we're at least on the right track here.
