You are the one that's clearly clueless. The market cap of bitcoin has nothing to do with this. Volume of btc traded in last 24 hours 15 billion USD, volume of tether in last 24 hours traded 17 billion USD.
There is nothing to think about logically, tether is being used to manipulate the price of bitcoin.
Telling people to invest in libra because they have a different opinion to you, good job!

I saw a bittrex post sometime that said they do not have contact numbers, only use the official emails for support. I will try and find the link

Reminds me of Mt Gox
Edit: Site looks cool though

I think he was talking about Tether "printing" tethers without a proper audit to show actual USD backing it

Maybe because BCash claims that blocksize increase is the best scaling option?

You have no idea how credit cards work do you?

From my experience everything has been perfect so far, ID Verification was pretty much instant, got $10 free from the referral but the fees are 3.99% from card purchases which is a lot lower that what I was paying buying from LocalBitcoins
From what i read everyone recommends GDAX, which is owned by Coinbase, as it has less fees. Good luck!

They used the testnet numbers I believe

No it's not your money, please stop bringing up cryptocurrencies and credit cards in the same sentence it's getting boring

You BORROW (&lt;---this is the key part) money each time you make a purchase, then you pay it back at the end of the month or whenever you choose.
