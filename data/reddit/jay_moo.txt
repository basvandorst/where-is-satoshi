Invoices should have the word "invoice", an invoice number, invoice date, amount, currency, details of goods supplied, date goods supplied, supplier details, customer details plus tax breakdown if sales tax applies to the sale. For double-entry in your own books, you would cross reference the invoice to the transaction going out of your bitcoin account.  AFAIK you don't have to prove where the money went, although IANA/L, because the supplier gave you the invoice.

Bitcoin is tainted brand, so some fear for their reputations if they seem too interested. Others can see how much it threatens their business models and want to replace it with something they can control. Meanwhile everyone buys a few just in case probably.

I've bought through bittylicious in UK a few times, so I guess selling works well too.

Edit: also what others said about volatility and credit card fees.  If retailers can offer a 5% discount to those who buy using bitcoin, and be reasonably sure they won't lose their 5% in price fluctuations, there is a reasonable chance.

They offer nearly a whole order of magnitude less than ebay for my old iphone. Fluctuations would have to be about +900% in BTC value to make it economical.

Sorry to hear about your lost btc. I guess all you can do is move on to start mining an altcoin where the GPUs can still cut it.

There is a giant vampire-squid-like machine-creature with tentacles in every government and business on the planet. This machine-creature tries to suck the financial value from any human activity for its own use. The entity is so powerful that it effectively owns most governments, media, and large corporations. 
If you make something new and interesting, and it starts to become potentially profitable, it will eventually come to the notice of the entity.  The entity will then use its enormous power to suck the value out of your new thing.  I think this entity is what OP is calling Borg.
Google 'vampire squid business' for more details.

This paper is well written, and very interesting.
In the acknowledgements, it would make more sense to acknowledge the 'Reddit community r/bitcoin', or the ' community'.  My reasoning is that you are publicly acknowledging their/our contributions, so your acknowledgement should be intelligible to any reader, rather than just the contributors who know what r/bitcoin means.

I enjoyed reading this paper.  
There is one idea which I felt may be able to maximise a miners profit over and above the ideas discussed in the paper.  
You identified the empirical propagation delay as an important parameter in estimating the optimum quantity of blockspace, but obviously, this delay parameter changes over time.
Rather than estimating the current propagation delay from historical data, would the miner not be able to further optimise their return by estimating the future propagation delay based on the direction and magnitude of changes of the propagation delay in the past, given that the actual propagation delay in the network will have changed between start and finish of the block?  It's a small optimisation but if done properly should further optimise returns (a little bit).

I was thinking some more about this and it's even more complex than shortest path, as some of the longer paths would also be relevant, giving mixing and other obfuscations.  
Maybe you need to elaborate over all the paths that connect the two nodes to get the real answer. At least the edges are directed, which helps simplify the problem.

Bittylicious was fast and easy for me, direct payment from bank account. I have no relationship with them.

I'm dubious, unless the tumbling is off-chain, like conversion via ripples (so you would then also need to include the ripples chain in the analysis). 
Help me out here, I'm pretty clueless, but I can't see how it would not be possible to analyse flows through a directed graph, and come up with a net flow from A to B, composed of a series of transactions.  Even if different individual coins are used for each link in the chain, how can it be made impossible to analyse flows?

I thought bitcoin were legally goods and not money.  Also how is a market illegal? Is ebay an illegal market if someone sells stolen goods?

escrow.  both parties in a trade either need to fully trust each other (you go first.. no you), or have a trusted third party to hold the coins until both transactions clear.

I guess it's a bit like a satnav algorithm.  Load the blockchain up as a set of 'edges' (or roads), plug in the start and end addresses of suspect A and suspect B, and ask the algorithm to plot you a route between the two.
