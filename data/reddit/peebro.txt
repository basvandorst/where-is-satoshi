You do realise you're on the Bitcoin subreddit, Right?

Check out his address posted above and you'll see the multiple accounts that his sent the bitcoin to.

I find your last question an interesting one. Very much a possibility depending on the information in the account which you may associate your blockchain address.

Yeah I think this is common practice in bitcoin theft, they call them tumbler accounts. These are in order to spread out the sum of cash to make the trail go cold and eventually move the bitcoins to a blockchain the thief deems safe. He didn't use 2FA on his email.

You know what I mean...

Thanks for the comment, luckily I am a techie, but I'm just looking for some suggestions on vulnerabilities such as the one suggested above. Ya it's looking like I may need to do an all out purge on this machine. Then 2FA email, 2FA blockchain, no browser extensions and maybe a VPN when dealing with bitcoins.

This is interesting. You see the computer in question is in my house, a secondary one that only my friends use, and he recently pointed out that both his toolbar and default homepage had changed, obviously one of my friends hadn't paid full attention during the install of some junk software. This could well be the cause, I just have to see how long ago it was installed. However it's using Firefox, but I don't think that changes much. Thanks for suggestions and links guys :)

literally zero tolerance for being ignorant and/or facetious on this subreddit :P
