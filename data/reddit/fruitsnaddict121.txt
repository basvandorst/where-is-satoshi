Didn’t even get through the first 20 seconds without getting triggered - “known as bitcoin Jesus”!??? Someone smack this lady with a sticker of Andreas’ hair line so it’s permanently stuck to her as a reminder who the true title owner is.. 
Edit: isn’t this the kind of person bitcoin/crypto was made to take financial control away from? Perhaps I’m still a little unseasoned in understanding fully the philosophy behind it all, BUT WASNT CUTTING OUT PEOPLE WHO DO SHADY SHIT AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS SIMPLY TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES PART OF THE WHOLE POINT OF DOING THIS? 
*sighs and rubs temples counterclockwise 
Someone educate me. Is he not a virus? The same bacteria we were suffocating under in the traditional financial system? Perhaps it’s simply the nature of mans relationship to power..

Thanks for the confidence boosting post. What is this Russian coin you speak of?
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:42:01
let me preface this with *im fairly novice* - with that being said, isn't that all sorts of illegal/immoral/protest-able? not just for ppl in the US to try and use it but also for the people in Zimbabwe who actually NEED this?
