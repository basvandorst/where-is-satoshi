Amazon already has Amazon Pay for users and runs offers on paying through Amazon Pay. Just why would they need a currency?

Thanks for sharing that. It's available here in Asia though.

Hi! You should raise a support ticket with Coinbase and share all relevant information, like the screenshot of the transaction from Binance. Exchanges generally resolve such issues if the amount of crypto is significant, say amounts to $5000 or more. I hope it works out for you!

Not as of now. 
Currently you can only estimate that number, but you wouldn't know how close to reality you actually are. If you currently run a node, you can you say how many transactions your node is processing. If you are connected to people running other nodes ( nearly all of them ), you could ask them. But then again, why would they give out such sensitive information.

Undoubtedly, Bitcoin has inspired people to take charge of their own finances rather than rely on centralized institutions to take care of it for them! It's a financial revolution for the masses.

I read the article and it reminds of Black Mirror's episode based on Social Scores for citizens, if your score falls below 3 points, you basically get banned from public places and society.

This is truly inspiring. I bought my first Bitcoin about 2 years back, and I've been consistently trading and buying since. It feels great to know that there are others out there, sharing the same belief in technology. 
Thank you!

The gaming industry is continuing to boom could reach over $100 billion by the end of 2019, meaning it's becoming a consumer space for stable bitcoin spending.  Xbox gamers have been downloading content in exchange of cryptocurrencies for years now. How many coffee shops do we walk into, and spend our Bitcoin? I'd say a handful, depending on where you stay. This isn't the same case for gaming. The gaming industry has a lot more utility and avenues for accepting Bitcoin as payment, compared to others. 
And with the steadily rising popularity of gaming, casinos and brands accepting Bitcoin as payment, gaming has a high chance of becoming a stable Bitcoin spending market.
