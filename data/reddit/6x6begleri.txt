Pay in Bitcoin, use USD to buy the same amount of Bitcoin to put back in your storage. No coin lost, a little more legitimate use out in the world. Win-Win.

So why is GDAX much more secure if it's the system behind CB?

You sound remarkably like someone who has no Bitcoin

I've recently gotten into Bitcoin using Coinbase for their ease of use. Where should I move to? Not an insane amount of money that needs the most security available, ease of use is important to me. Advice?

It's not irrelevant, if you're buying with USD, the cheaper it is the more you can buy.

If it was predictable there would be a lot more rich people around right now. You couldn't have known the price would rise this high, this fast. Even the people on this sub that predicted it correctly (IE Buying and Holding), didn't really even make that prediction from an educated guess. It was an outright gamble that paid off. Anyone who says otherwise suffers from Hindsight bias. They think they knew it would happen because it did happen.
All that said, it's not too late to invest and I will be doing it soon. Just don't take the past as an indicator for the future. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose, and don't pull out early. In 10 years time BitCoin is either going to be worth 0$ or a shit ton more than it is now. That's why I'm investing. I'd be more upset missing out than I would be losing a few grand of my savings.

Honestly, I feel like the risk of me fucking up a private wallet are even higher than the risk of CB being fraudulent or getting breached.
