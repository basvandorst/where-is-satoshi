Guys I need help. I tried to pay with bitcoin on an eshop but the address was only available for 15 minutes. It didnt receive the payment in time and now it is expired. But since i sent it already, what is going to happen? When I look in my transaction history it is there but its uncomplete and it says verification process (0/3). So if it cant get verified because the adress expired will I get it back?
