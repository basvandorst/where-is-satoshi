Your Government here.
I cannot take your bitcoins. 
Would you like to give them to me?
Wait in this jail cell and think about it. 
Take as long as you would like.
Enjoy your new friends.

bridge21 is open about how they do it. They are buying and selling when you send, or at least selling when you send if I remember. Most of the other companies are mysterious about how they settle money. I'm curious too.

That's just flat out wrong. Plenty of things have their value rise by 10% in 24 hours for sound reasons. If there is a financial crisis and gold/btc go up 10%, that's sound. If there is a drought and the price of soybeans skyrockets, that's sound too. You are trying to judge whether price moves are 'real' or not based on some 'efficient markets' hypothesis. Classic rookie mistake. Markets aren't efficient. Be careful because you are going to get fleeced by more experienced traders.

It depends on what the email receive says verbatim, but it could be their fault.
File a formal complaint at your State Attorney General's office and with the CFTC. 
Both probably have online forms. CFTC as one specifically or "virtual currency". 
Also file a compliant with your state's money service business regulator.
If that doesn't work, call an attorney.

I think you missed this news: 
Markets are speculative. That's the point!

NO. No 'best practices' bullshit.
Get your bitcoin off of services that don't let you control the private keys. Period.
breadwallet and mycelium are both great. If you need more, use a hardware or paper wallet.

I don't think you understand the words that I wrote. Did you ACTUALLY read what I wrote, or are you going on what others tell you on these subjects?
I've been here since late 2010. I'm making my own decisions, thanks.

You say "more dynamic than ever" as if that means something good?! Do you believe unpredictable fees and wait times when transferring value to other users is a good thing?


It is price fixing. Demand has exceeded supply, not because of the dust and gambling transactions from 2010, but because of steady growth in use over seven years. 


There is no technical reason the limit must remain at 1MB today, especially with thin blocks. I suppose it might be necessary if your goal is to cripple Bitcoin.


Because they are both written in code? Are you familiar with Bitcoin's history? This statement is wildly unpopular opinion that goes against the grain of the Bitcoin project.


This is FUD. There have been two (2) hard forks in Bitcoin's history. Bitcoin is not Ethereum. We have a 2 week difficulty adjustment period, and a 2MB hard fork would be extremely popular with everyone if proposed by core.
I believe the reason core has not proposed a 2MB hardfork is because once we again demonstrate that it is a safe way to upgrade the protocol, there will be no more reason to keep Bitcoin rate limited. This rate limiting is what makes side chains and LN more valuable. It's pretty obvious that blockstream wants to be a well paid "channel monitor". 
Question, are you paid by a company in the Bitcoin industry? Which one? You should disclose this before expressing things like this, so people know if you have financial conflicts of interest.
I just own Bitcoin, how about you?
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:59:50
Stop changing the subject. Leaving the max_block_size at 1MB is price fixing and isn't popular with any users, businesses, or miners, outside of those aligned with certain special interests.
Refusing to raise Bitcoin's transaction capacity is also a fantastic way to pacify Bitcoin from the perspective of banks by keeping it low volume and expensive.
@_date: 2016-12-13 20:37:41


Who said anything about 1 million transactions per second?
How about 6 transactions per second, and double that every two years to keep pace with Moore's law.




I don't care if Blockstream employees receive part of their salary in Bitcoin. That's a feel good PR statement.
Can you share how Blockstream plans to earn revenue and gain customers? 
Blockstream has invested a lot of money putting core developers on the employee and contractor list. Private companies have to make a return for investors, or at least satisfy their promises to investors. Considering how much investor money has and is being spent to pay for Bitcoin development the community deserves to know why.
They aren't a non-profit. A for profit company doesn't invest money without a plan to get a return, either directly, or by making their investors a return elsewhere.
It is very difficult to trust you when your employer's business plans are obscured and funded by corporations that do not have Bitcoin's best interests at heart.
Please elucidate.

I am not part of a Brigade.
This is Satoshi's vision, and why so many of us joined Bitcoin:


Also, reading all the various things Satoshi said comprises the vision for how Bitcoin would grow. The current direction isn't just technical changes, it's a fundamental change to the point of Bitcoin, from peer to peer electronic cash to a very expensive settlement system.
Labeling the guy who wanted peer to peer electronic cash as a developer for a team that is steering the bus down a different road is disingenuous and dishonest.
Theymos has a lot of nerve rebranding Satoshi as a "bitcoin core developer".
Are Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik, and Gavin A also "bitcoin core developers" too?
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:16:55
That's his job. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 21:20:55
That's a lie. Scaling to 8MB and above is possible right now using code that already works on Main Net, without relying on vaporware powered by unicorn flatulence.

Trolling! Why is this post not removed?

[Here you go.](
Bitcoin's remaining users will not choose LN over Bitcoin. It will require 3rd parties and compromise user privacy.
Users who have not adopted Bitcoin will not choose this crazy complicated stuff over the bank they trust, WeiChat, PayPal or Venmo.
The bozos in corestream are designing a technology to solve a problem that they created in order to meet a customer need that doesn't exist.
Name one business that is actively using sidechains or lightning networks as a core part of their business to generate revenue and serve customers. Just one, only requirement is someone can say they are a customer and review the service, and that these customers are paying for it and using it on main net.
I'm not sure how you have a strawman caricature of vaporware.
@_date: 2016-12-13 20:44:37


There I fixed that for you. The white paper popularly quoted is false and not what Satoshi envisioned.
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:18:07
Right, because theymos and blockstream have done so much good for Bitcoin I'm being unreasonable and we can afford to cut them some slack...
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:28:14
Do you know what is also more efficient? PayPal.
Bitcoin isn't powerful because it is efficient. It is powerful because it resists attempts to control it. LN as proposed weakens Bitcoin's ability to resist intermediaries, because it requires intermediaries other than the sender and receiver (hubs, channel monitors).
LN is not Bitcoin or intended to replace Bitcoin. The author of the LN whitepaper said as much on the ycombinator forums. We need to increase the max_block_size limit in Bitcoin proper.

If you think sidechains and lightning networks are the first iPhone or the personal computer, you are smoking some serious crack.
Bitcoin is @ brilliant. That's why it is worth eleven figures, and why people like me won't let it die.
These L2 networks are inspired ideas that don't have the integrity or simple genius of the original invention.
Stop supporting L2 networks. It's a waste of time. Core is supposed to be about improving the core. CORE. Bitcoin!

Services that monitor channels for you and potentially hold your private keys sound an awful lot like Coinbase and/or banks to me. 
I do not believe that people using Bitcoin today will want to use a system that requires 3rd party channel monitors to work. 
I also do not believe people not already using Bitcoin will switch to this over their bank, PayPal, or Venmo.
I think LN is cool, and probably a great way to build a decentralized Bitcoin exchange (for fiat), or for two companies to exchange lots of transactions off chain. I do not think it's a replacement for regular Bitcoin. I think we need to grow Bitcoin while technologies like LN develop over time.

Bitcoin got to 11 figures when my views were considered (and in several cases adopted). The value has gone no where but sideways since the present interest-conflicted developers usurped control.
@_date: 2016-12-13 19:41:15


Limiting supply to 3 transactions per second when demand would go higher is price fixing. It causes fees to jump higher than they would be if the market were able to reach an equilibrium point between supply and demand.


Some people say that soft fork SegWit is a sneaky way to change the economics of P2SH transactions so that lightning and sidechains are economical for companies banking on them as future technologies. Other people say we agreed to a 2MB hard fork with SegWit, not a soft work SegWit with changes to the economics of signature witness data.

If it is "really silly" then why did theymos take the time to change Satoshi's title to "bitcoin core developer"?
Death by a thousand paper cuts...
