@_date: 2014-10-22 07:34:35
It was only a question of time until this would happen.
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:57:43

@_date: 2014-02-28 14:59:18

DO NOT download or open the attachment from the link if you receive that E-Mail! It has a .scr file within the attachment, not any type of document.

~~have the same problem on bter.com - waiting more than 4 hours now for processing. support said do not worry, they will fix it...~~
my btc withdrawal from bter was just processed after 6 hours - something really seems to slow down the major exchanges
unfortunately, 7 hours later, the transfer is still not credited, nor has it entered the blockchain... :(

meaning he can now fly in his daily Starbucks drink while staying at the hotel?
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:47:17
"...in a manner that will best serve our customers..."
like: hire someone for 10$/hour to do the withdrawals by hand for god's sake
(and I don't mean that nice japanese drink)

@_date: 2014-02-13 06:32:07
Yeah. like the earth is a flat disc and the sun travels around us.

It's a .rar with the .scr inside (maybe more, have not checked for hidden files), I uploaded it to uploaded.net:
This is the link from the mail:
Yes, most tech-savvy people will not fall for whatever is hidden in it, but just in case!

I did set up my router recently to forward port 8333 to my computer running the bitcoin-qt client, and the number of connections did rise to 20+ shortly after allowing bitcoin-qt and my firewall to accept the connections from and to the web. 
A few days later bitcoin-qt does not show or get more than 8 connections again, also nothing has changed on my side. 
Any ideas why this is happening?
Computer is always on and has a high-bandwith internet connection.

any news from the chinese side of the globe?
@_date: 2013-12-28 12:04:40
you could have it worse - like mining in 2011 but spending everything on electricity bills and online-stuff (wow, a 1 month account only 2.352 Bitcoin?! saves me 10 bucks in my pocket) after selling your rig.
and then later fall for dicing and stuff before realizing you just wasted a lot of money ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:32:51
aaaand thats it.
maybe you find a recording online somewhere if interested

I do recommend the chocolate-nut-berry-cake! (and if you visit them in the evening, they have a much nicer smile on their faces :) )
