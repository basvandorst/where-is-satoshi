Totally agree.  To me this is the biggest risk. If i had 20,000 bitcoins, I'd give 10 each to everyone high up in the us government.

sorry to hear that, man.

right now on kraken eth is 666/USD, on coinbase it's 722/USD...

It's not the fees per se, it's that on coinbase the coins themselves are much more expensive.  Litecoins were 370 at coinbase when they were 330 everywhere else.

I fuckin hate banks asking for my passport, job contract and everyone on the phone knowing how much money I have, my address, and my phone number.

"quasiphilosopher" is right, I'm saying to do what he did, not be as smart as him or to otherwise imitate  some innate attribute that would qualify him as an outlier.

The all time winningest strategy in crypto is to go ALL-IN, all savings in crypto, get paid in crypto, and exchange at point of sale to fiat.  
That's how it becomes a currency, you're all in and you can't hold because when you eat you need to spend a bit.
Don't think so ? Look at Olaf Carlson-Wee.

No, it's not. My "definition" is what Carson-Wee did. All-in is living your life in crypto.. not forcing anyone else to live theirs in crypto.

No, more like 100k a year paid every two weeks with the equivalent amount of bitcoin at that time...

What do you think about Tether ?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:43:09
I don't understand. To you, that wouldn't count as "all in" ?

I'm not being a fucker here. My definition is as all-in as you can get—and you *are* getting paid in crypto. Coinbase—of all companies—paid Carson Wee in bitcoin equivalent to his USD salary every week. He was paid in bitcoin.  But even Coinbase wouldn't agree to a fixed amount of BTC—even though that's what Carson-Wee asked for. He never held dollars. Coinbase paid him in varying amounts of bitcoin and he spent them.
There is no company in the world who will pay you in fixed bitcoin the way you're suggesting. They won't take the risk.
