I would actually be really excited for that. I think that’s what we need. A blockchain money system that’s usable. Estonia runs their entire government on blockchain. They vote through blockchain technology. I think blockchain is more exciting than bitcoin itself. I think bitcoin is turning into digital gold. It has value, it can increase I’d decrease in value. But you don’t go to the store and buy coffee with gold or bitcoin. In terms of peer to peer monetary transactions I think PayPal leads the way. PayPal is the safest way and consumer friendly way to purchase things online. You can even get low I interest loans from PayPal. I think a digital usCurrency backed by the fed would be awesome.  I like bitcoin but I dont like it cause I’m some anarchist who wants to get rid of our financial system. Some key flaws in bitcoin is speculation and not enough adoption. However if I am correct it may just turn into a digital form of gold.

I tried to get my dad to invest in bitcoin 6 years ago. He had no job and no money but he inherited 700,000 dollars from my grandma passing away. He ended up investing in real estate. My parents are divorced and I thought there was a lot of potential in bitcoin. He ended up buying 7 houses in North Carolina and was renting them out. He basically lives off the money he makes through that and makes about 3000 a month. He bought the houses in a short sale but I calculated it and if he invested in bitcoin it would be worth close to 40 million dollars. I still regret not investing myself. I had saved 2000 dollars over the summer from working and instead of saving or investing I cashed out and bought a computer. I was 13 by the way.
