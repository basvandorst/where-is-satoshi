If this was me in this picture, I'd be fucking pissed. Why do people this this is OK?

You can do things that are legal that still make you an asshole.

Probably the guy in the photo, if he knew. But I’m sure once OP explained that it was legal and there wasn’t sensitive info on the screen he would be fine with this.

This is NOT "street photography" or fucking soccer this is taking a picture over someone's shoulder, through a window, with his screen showing.
I'm sure if you found this guy and showed him this post he's be totally cool with it, yes?

So if you asked him you think he'd be cool with it, or you just don't care?
I get it, people do this on Reddit all the time. I still find it gross.

You can go either: 
1. Bank -&gt; Cash Wallet -&gt; Buy Bitcoin, or 
2. Bank -&gt; Buy Bitcoin. 
If you go with 2 you've locked in your purchase price. If you go with 1 the price can fluctuate before you make your purchase (I think so anyway). Either way you've got to wait a week.

There is a difference between security cameras and sneaking a pic of someone to shitpost on social media. OP is completely within his rights, but it’s just a dick move. I would hope no one would do this to me, but I guess you’d be cool with it.
