decent strat. good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:16
lol, that's reassuring /s

chill, no insecurities, just pondering thoughts. their important to have. a community without questioning-concerns is a community that blindly walks off the edge.
Also, hate to be this dumb, but do you mind telling me what cboe cme is?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:05:45
that's making a fair bit of sense. thank you.

I actually tend to buy in on dips. I wasn't trying to come across as a sell-shill, just trying to understand the eery calmness people seem to treat bitcoin with. Are bitcoin investors simply ignoring the possibility of a bubble and just having some risky fun? (nothing wrong with that really, just wanna know personally)

damn, you actually came back to this to boast about your gains haha
I understand your issue now, you apparently can't read. In my post I said I invested. This wasn't a sell-shitpost, it was a simple question.
So, I *also* made 15k "in my sleep" hahaha you fucking tool
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:04:45
Yeah, I guess that's fair.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:46
solid advice, though I do wonder if the "nobody knows" epidemic could be caused by the unwillingness people seem to have towards honestly discussing these things...

So, realistically, why wouldn't Japan and the like follow if US ends up banning it? Seems like they have shady businesses &amp; strong motivation from the banks as much as anyone else, no?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:05:27
yea, totally agree. Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:03:20
dude, chill the fuck out. Asking a question to get the community's **opinion** on things doesn't make me an entitled brat demanding answers being handed to me.
Seriously, I feel like your projecting the "muh insecurities" excuse as you seem to be the one who is getting super sensitive over literal questions.
Is this how you handle people in the real world? "Stop questioning things I like!"
Also, how am I ignoring the "adoption of the people"? I specifically mention that exact thing...
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:01:53
memes aside, do you really believe bitcoin will ever hit a million? or are you saying when your investment hits that?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:06:42
lol, I was just joking a bit. I'm just trying to understand if bitcoin is a science or an experiment. I'm fine with either honestly
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:25:01
Thanks! This is very helpful! I get the feeling it's best to separate bitcoin from it's cash value when discussing it's "world" value, huh?
