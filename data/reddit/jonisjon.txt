Yea... this seems like the more reasonable possible result for BFX, would much rather have a 36% haircut + BFX coin IOU's than having to have this thing tied up in bankruptcy court for years and perhaps getting even less or nothing back.
You seem to be over-reacting when you could get nothing at all.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:10:26
This is pure FUD and perhaps confusion on part of OP. Just check the chain and it will be obvious you are missing nothing. Keeping a ledger of your exodus transactions makes no sense when the blockchain keeps that ledger for you and is truth. I have been a exodus user for years and have never had a single issue and their team and support is top notch.
OP if you truly think you "lost" coin somehow post the proof here with blockchain transaction links along with specific examples, otherwise this is nothing but speculation and FUD and the most likely explanation is you don't understand what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:39:25
You have no idea what you are talking about. No fees are deducted before a tx reached the chain, miner fees are clearly displayed in every block explorer for every transaction. Post the blockchain txids of the transactions in question or stop spreading FUD. No fees are ever deducted "before" hitting the chain, don't spread clearly false information.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:02:39
Posts with no txids mean nothing. This is one of the many purposes of a blockchain, no one can lie about what happened because it's all on chain. If you don't post actually txids that others can audit this is just FUD.

Can anyone seriously think after reading through the 31 pages of this document (as i am doing now) that this is a good thing?

Well said Erik - build on we will!
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:42:48
Well articulated as always Erik!
 I wish I was more surprised by the any of the media's deception and general incompetence when it comes to reporting on bitcoin at this point but I am not. Doesn't mean we should stop expecting and wanting better reporting from news outlets though. Even with them butchering your comments hopefully another outlet will make more effort to get some of your message across (like bloomberg did yesterday).

This is a real long time from when I was tipped, but thanks for the tip! I got lost in the web of confusion after the gox news and couldn't tell where this tip came from and just refound this thread which i thought had died originally!

Very nice! As mentioned in the other bearwhale thread today I know the top image was one of those commissioned by shapeshift.io: [shapeshift.io/bearwhale.html]( 
Excellent works!

So those of us who have been using your service without issue are out of luck huh? I have been using the instant buy without issue as well as referring many people to your service. With this change I am not sure if I will continue to use or refer people. This a very drastic change, I agree something like 5 btc would be far more reasonable.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:16:03
I too am curious about this both which one it is (so I can visit) and also how they are processing the transactions.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:52:57
Everyone should give to this worthy cause! This is an area that has very little public funding and bitcoin users can go a long way towards helping! Doubling up donations if we can reach 10 BTC is awesome as well.

Hmmm... a podcast between too popular personalities seems more like it would just be a conversation about their opinions? Their not mentioning something is "censorship"? as opposed to actively blocking discussion on something on a "open" forum?
Even granting that terrible argument, why would censorship in one place be a justification for censorship somewhere else?

Ironic from the someone who clearly is the one trying to reimagine history and doesn’t seem to understand the implications of UASF if it had activated with minority support as likely would have happened without S2X saving the day. Try on  or  or do your own research via google. It was well known at the time that even though UASF was a “soft” fork, it was actually more dangerous than many “hard” forks and could very well have a caused a chain split 
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:27:05
You are incredibly wrong, for those of us who were there without S2X Segwit would never have activated and the dangerous UASF would of caused the very chain split everyone was worried about. Segwit activated despite UASF not at all because of it.

the definition of holding customer funds is ambiguous in New York and many products could fall under it. Also they are attempting to regulate crypto-crypto not just flat conversion.
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:00:11
bitlicense regulates crypto-crypto exchange the same way as fiat to crypto - as a result shapeshift had to leave (plus it sounds like they didn't want to with storing large amounts of personal customer data that could be hacked)
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:04:14
Um - shapeshift implemented segwit well over a month ago now so OP's post is clearly wrong and FUD. Did you ever think maybe they are setting higher fees because if they don't txs won't be confirmed quickly and their users complain?
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:52:25
it is - bitlicense requires large amounts of data collection/retention that could power identity theft
@_date: 2016-09-15 01:43:51
They didn't remove them from shapeshift, just from the Apple Store app (because apple is not giving them a choice). If you don't upgrade or just use the website everything is still available

That worked! Thank you sir :)

Personally I have stopped using Coinbase for my business, they shut down our merchant account for no reason after 1.5 years of consistent usage (after we supplied mountains of AML/KYC info they wanted) and were generally rude and unpleasant about the whole process.
Coinbase has gone from my favorite to least favorite BTC company and unless they get their customer service act together at the very least I will not be using or recommending them ever again.
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:53:12
any ideas?

I want it to be clear I am not railing against them asking for compliance info. I am frustrated because of poor/rude support that refused to help in any meaningful way. To this point at least Bitpay has been miles ahead in terms of support.
I really like CoinBase and hope they get their act together regarding this.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:17:25
I don't want to post the whole support thread which contains a LOT of my own personal information about myself and my business (I was putting up compliance documents afterall). They consistently avoided my questions, refused to clarify which documents I was supposed to upload (which I asked multiple times), told me on chat "we can't talk about this and can't help you", have no phone support or willingness to call me to work out issues with more speed, and took days to reply - when they did reply they just repeated what they had been saying offering no further clarification that i asked for and didn't answer any questions at all.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:37:53
I've already had enough frustration from coinbase the last week, I don't wish to debate a paid shill (your very namesake) for their company at this point. Coinbase has all the info and knows what they did. I don't really care if the community wants to judge them on this or not, I just wanted to vent and share my story, that I have done.
The info in the support thread is too personal to my business to just post up here. So if you wish to not judge coinbase on this, thats fine, don't judge them. Doesn't make a difference to me.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:16:19
Yea I see this problem too, if you want to take credit card payments through a service like Square (which my business also does), you have to give them very little information at all. To take bitcoin payments (which in theory should be easier) we are forced to bend over backwards, its not a good climate currently.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:43:41
I've been trying to convince them that could be a good option (without pushing it on them), but most of them aren't quite on-board with that yet. Hopefully soon :)
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:52:08
in case my email never makes it as i suspect...
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:10:32
Back when i first setup coinbase merchant processing they were not requiring any of this (neither was Bitpay at the time). Bitpay asked for full compliance info as well to setup my merchant processing, they were just far easier to deal with.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:40:02
Its a good point and I would love to do that, however we need USD to run cash-flow of our business still. We have a number of employees being paid W2 and direct deposit, and for that we need to get USD to continue operations. In the future as things evolve I would love to just take BTC directly.
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:53:42
All the more reason for bitcoin - keep it in wallets that are backed up and off site. Cold storage could be a real big deal for dispensaries who are holding way too much cash.

RAW has similar comments about a digital currency in his book/movie script "reality is what you make of it" that I was reading through this weekend
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:29:48
Yes it's a big problem here in colorado because most dispensaries are forced to be cash only business because banks won't have them. As a result they are often sitting on a ton of cash and it's not safe for anyone involved. Bitcoin would be infinitely safer and easier to hold large amount securely.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:35:34
Its a legal industry that the majority of the American population (according to recent Gallup polls) supports. I understand wanting to stay away from the stigma but honestly some dispensaries are going to use it anyway - we can't just "hide" it from them and assume they won't use it. Might as well spread the legitimate use.

Am I the only one who thinks Greenspan sounds like a confused old man in this article?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:28:03
Good to know -- thanks! I am still waiting up to 24 more hours for my money to clear. I signed up for both CampBX and Bitfloor -- I will be waiting out the crazy market lag we have been seeing today and then figuring out what i want to do once things settle down.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:07:33
IT seems like CampBX is just another market -- it doesn't solve the quick funding to a market problem that bitinstant was supposed to solve.
To the person who recommended bitfloor, i am not sure if that is a market or a bitinstant competitor but either ways seems like their servers are currently down.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:11:55
As a volunteer for this organization I can not recommend enough that everyone who can donates a little bit to this very worthy organization.
They are doing some incredible work and they could really use some support from the bitcoin community to make sure that it keeps getting funded (as no one except for MAPS and handful of other smaller non-profits are actually funding legal FDA approved research for the medicinal uses of psychedelics). 
This is really an area where some wealthy bitcoiners could hugely speed up progress in an area of medicinal science that has had next to no funding for nearly half a century from the public sector because of recent political history. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:32:04
Your points are obvious to anyone who frequents r/bitcoin and you are missing the main point. Most CO dispensaries don't have the ability to put money in the bank - the band won't let them. This means they are literally sitting on safes full of cash and this makes them vulnerable to theft, loss, inflation and all sort of other nasty things.
I would not recommend any business keep all of their cash in bitcoin of course, they could always use coinbase or bit pay to convert it quickly (hopefully) but if they could at least keep some portion in bitcoin this is much safer storage wise than hoards of cash.

As a resident of CO, I plan on going to different retail dispensaries Jan 1st (when they all open up to the general public) and suggesting bitcoin to them and see how many i can get on board!
It really does make a lot of sense for them to use this with the issues they are still having with banks. It doesn't make sense for them to hold the amount of cash they normally do.
