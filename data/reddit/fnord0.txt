also to answer your first question, no we just are starting out selling SAE (silver american eagles) at this time

I used to get the idle miner issue as well, but since upgrading to the latest [phoenix miner]( (as of this post =&gt; v1.48) and now using [phoenix rising]( (which has the option to **restart after an idle time of *X* seconds**, this issue has completely resolved itself! one other option with PR is to use a BACKUP POOL if the main pool is down for an extended period). personally, I've gotten nothing but respect and LOTS of help from the group running it. so I will just say I disagree with ya on the 'dickish' comment, but then again, this is the internet, and some people can be assholes. =)

I'm **very** happy with bitcoinpool.com (actually never knew it was accessible @ .org) ... I've been mining for **exactly** 2months, and have made 90BTC so I cannot complain what-so-ever. I've pointed friends and family to use this site, as it was my first introduction to bitcoin, and continues to be my favorite way to make bitcoins. heck, even my dad is getting into mining! heh
one of the admins of the the site frequents the local hackerspace - he's been more then willing to answer questions, and help out in every way possible. very knowledgeable bunch, the peeps running it! the suggested miner is phoenix miner =&gt; there's a great [HOWTO]( posted on the site, and just recently someone from the [forums]( posted of the [phoenix rising GUI]( (which has improved my speeds by 30+MH/sec overall spread across 4x video cards! not too shabby) I did find that version 1.4 of PR did not work for me and a friend, but [v1.31]( is working great!

Very good point - My best answer to your question is that APMEX doesn't sell Silver for Bitcoins. We're one of the first to sell **Silver American Eagles coins** for **Bitcoins**, and *ONLY bitcoins*. There is good amount of risk involved on the seller's end. we are quite competative in price to our nearest [competitor(s)]( we also offer free shipping on all new orders in an effort to promote our new business endevour.

ETF? I'm going to need to break out google for that term there... ;) (to be continued)
Wow, I see where your going now. I think you may have something there for sure ;)   I have forwarded your comments to the financial backer of the site. Thank you for sharing your insight!

YES! I agree, I've been waiting for ANY update on the Single's, as well. 
From my understanding up/until this point the current "Single's" forsale on the BFL site are @ [50GH/s]( yet there is word that's been going around that BFL is going to keep their original advertised speed "promise" of 60GH/s for the people that ordered prior to the *price increase*/*speed decrease*. I take that as meaning they will ship us the [current "Single" revision @ 50GH/s]( and possibly [2x 5GH/s Jalapeno's]( to meet the original advertised 60GH/s speeds(?) does anyone know if this is true and/or have thoughts on how BFL intends to "reimburse" the people who originally ordered when the 60GH/s "BitForce Single SC" was being advertised?
