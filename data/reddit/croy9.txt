I agree it doesn't cause "inflation" because we measure inflation based on what poor people buy, not rich. Look at the price increases on things like super cars, yachts, art, stocks and bonds. Bankers print money from nothing and loan it to the elite. The hope is that the elite then use that money to hire regular people to start new business or open new locations. If this was happening, wages would go up and inflation would rise. Instead, they trade their stack of printed money amongst each other, causing bubbles everywhere they are active. Everyone points at the rich and says "look at how much richer they are getting, this isn't fair, TAX THEM!", but the real problem is the system itself. Every since the US abandoned the last vestiges of the gold standard in the 70's, it's been a non-stop printing party enriching the very top.

I agree, central banks printing money from nothing and buying debt and equities has not yet eroded confidence in financial markets. I don't think it will be this activity that implodes the economy (although in a sane world I would expect it to, the central bank of Sweden owns more common stock in Facebook than Mark Zuckerburg).
The reason QE hasn't already resulted in extraordinary inflation is because that money never really found it's way to people with high marginal propensity to consume. Also the reason why it didn't really produce much GDP. I think that next time around, the same old QE will be even less effective and they will get that money into the hands of the people "even if it means throwing cash out of a helicopter" to paraphrase former fed chair Ben Bernanke. This is where inflation will come from, in my opinion.

Well, the Keynesian answer to economic downturn is to print lots of money to spur spending and investment. The downside to this is that it can cause inflation and it prevents bad companies from going under and the completion of the business cycle (bad companies go under, bad debts written off, deflation).
An important distinction about all this money-printing is who the newly-printed money is available to. It essentially comes in the form of lower interest rate loans available to the most elite borrowers (large banks etc.) These borrowers are theoretically supposed to invest that money in new businesses and factories that employ people, which improves the economy for everyone. 
Unfortunately, since 2008, that is not what has happened. Almost all of that new borrowed money simply went to stocks, bonds, and real estate. That's why there is no inflation in things that ordinary people buy, because that money largely did not make its way into the hands of ordinary people. Inflation is measured on the costs of goods ordinary people buy not the things rich people buy.
If you look a what rich people buy, the inflation is quite apparent. Luxury goods, like yachts, supercars, expensive art, private planes, these things are all rising in price rapidly, while hamburger is still relatively cheap. Rich people aren't buying more hamburger with their extra money.
Currently, the Fed doesn't have a lot of dry powder for this money-printing. It seems like a long time ago, but the "emergency measures" (QE) are only just barely being rolled back nearly ten years later. This means that the next recession will likely happen before the Fed has gotten its balance sheet back to normal.
So, I think there are a couple ways to look at all this. It could be that in the next recession, the whole country (world?) bites the bullet, debts are written off, big companies fail, pensions fail, even governments fail, and the end of the business cycle actually occurs and there is a great economic cataclysm that 2008 should have been, had we all been responsible adults that pay the consequences of our bad decisions. This would result in BTC crashing along with everything else, I think.
That idea is politically untenable. I think the far more likely outcome is that we do the same thing we've always done, except instead of quantitative easing for the rich, in the form of loans to those previously mentioned elite banks, it will be QE for the people in the form of universal basic income or some other benefit scheme. This will result in rampant inflation and bitcoin will moon.

I agree, the cash does not disappear, it ends up in the bank accounts of the wealthy. If you want to see that money get in the hands of ordinary people, it would have to be invested in business expansion, not stock buybacks.

Mining difficulty adjusts based on how many miners there are, not how many bitcoins are left unmined. If half the miners suddenly stopped, mining difficulty would drop drastically but there would be the same number of coins left to mine.

I'm not very active on Reddit so maybe things have changed or something, but wtf is going on in this thread? There are all these negative comments that don't even have a kernel of true FUD ("wait 2ish months, the rollercoaster admission will be cheap again") from *redditor for very short time*. In addition, it seems they were heavily upvoted in a short period of time.
Are people getting paid to shit on bitcoin here? I mean, it seems like a silly waste of money for whoever is paying them, but there are so many negative posts with no information or comment, and then they don't even reply to people who engage them.

My point is clear to anyone who isn't mad they lost. We can't give do-overs on votes because the losing side cries.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:59:52
Yup, and if the next result is leave, I'm sure a lot of people would regret it too, and then we could just vote again. We can just keep voting until we get what the authoritarians want. Much more reasonable than doing what the people voted for. They were confused.

I agree with you but am of two minds. On one hand, I find it horrifying how brainwashed our whole society is to WORK BREED CONSUME. And this is an example of it happening to the youngest and most vulnerable of us. On the other hand, it's recreation. What are we gonna do, be mad about every kind of fun because there is underlying corruption and greed? Can we really have ANYTHING nice without someone involved being shitty? Do we have to let shitty people ruin everything good?

You are talking about forming governments in congress, which is something completely different. The people we elected cannot agree and form a government, so we have a new election. The new election is not because a higher authority decided the people didn't know what they wanted; it was because the people voted in cannot accomplish what they must.
Brexit was a referendum with a definitive outcome that has not been implemented. If a new vote takes place, or if Brexit is not implemented, I believe it is a violation of the rights of those voters, whether they were confused or not.

The federal reserve actually does increase Chase's account by $1B, and they do that by creating the $1B out of nothing, which common people call "printing". I'm not going to write huge paragraphs explaining all this, just if anyone else is reading, this guy really doesn't know what he's talking about.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:46:49
But that argument can be made for any vote at any time. Anyone who was unsatisfied with a vote can dig up people that might have voted the other way. The argument you're making is that that vote doesn't really represent the will of the people, but some other source better shows the will of the people. When you say that the people who voted are confused or regretful, you are saying that some other authority than the voters should decide if the vote was valid. If people could just step back from "my guy lost" to "the establishment is trying to reverse election results that they don't like", I think they would see what a terrible danger this type of attitude is. 
This deep in the thread, no one will believe me, but I'm a liberal. I voted for Obama twice and caucused for Bernie Sanders. But I can't go along with the worship of the establishment and corruption to support it. Re-doing votes because of the outcome is some banana-republic tier corruption. Intelligence services targeting a duly elected president for overthrow is some banana-republic tier corruption.

The vast majority of dollars aren’t physically printed, they are electronically created. OP was using “printed” to mean all dollars created, as it may relate to inflation. Your whole post is about physically created money. Sounds smart though.

It covers rent and "owner's equivalent rent", with the latter being some approximation of what rent would be if the owner of the home was renting it at market rate. The actual price of homes is not part of the calculation, which can become quite disconnected from the cost of rent.

I’ve had one. You get to put your money in one of the approved funds from a list. Then pay tax on the money plus extra if you take it out before you’re 59 and a half. If used exactly correctly, it can save money, but you are giving up your freedom and control of that money to a large degree.

The federal reserve and banking cartel are government sponsored entities that have the special right to print money from nothing, backed by nothing. If there were a keystone to a command and control economy, it would be the banking system. I would even go so far as to so communism would be near impossible without limitless fiat currency.
