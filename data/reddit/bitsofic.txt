This is not correct. New bitcoin remains 3600 per day (25 every 10 minutes) until the halving in mid 2016

Governments (not only the greek)  'simply' have to move to utility-based tax.  A government should create or maintain 'utilities' for its people, like waste removal, or street lights. Everything else , like buying weapons or paying off the debt to the banks, are not in their core business.  Bitcoin, in combination with the 'Internet of Things' can make it possible that with micropayments, every time you like a streetlight to go on, you pay a few satoshi for it.  Every time you like to go in the city park, you pay for this utility. If people really want to buy bombs to throw on people they don't know, they should vote for it, and not leave the decision to a small group that gets your taxes and use it for things you might not approve of.
In short, micropayments can solve the 'tragedy of the commons'. Right now money is collected by  labor tax and VAT, essentially to keep the utilities (like the city park)  free,  which is upside-down. Bitcoin will force them to change all that and return governments to their core business.

As others also mentioned in this thread, it is nearly impossible to shut down bitcoin, short of turning off the internet. And if they do, still people could avoid taxes to trade with each other and use eggs as method of payment, or lighters, or even gold. Also keep in mind, that once we ditched this 'disease' what is the current system, we probably need a lot less weapons then we need now.  After 5000  years of civilization, we should be able to do better then still bashing each others head in.  One reason that we still do that, is because we never were able to create real value and keep it, because we were stupid enough to keep this value on paper notes with an average lifespan of 27 years.  its like we are building a sand castle all the time. Real money like gold or bitcoin makes real, long-lasting value like stone castles that are still around after centuries.  Once we realize that, nobody will be so poor that he needs to shoot other people for food. Welcome to the future. :)
