Yes. The only important Question is ... How long will power still be created by world-destroying nuclear enery and resourceabusive ways. Green Power creation has nothing to do with bitcoin.

this bug seems like a real unwanted one. they optimize the shit out of everything and everyone gets hard and all want it as fast as possible. you could notice this behaviour in onlinegame devs many times, until some decompiling player notices a weird circumstance and abuses it.

@_date: 2018-08-22 18:23:04
right, bitcoin produces ZERO everlasting atomic waste or climatekiller C02. its politics that have to stop this mass fossile fuel burning bullshit. renewables work. and they work since a long time, they just want to keep their centralised cancerproducing hustle.
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:45:45
There is a difference. Noone forces you to use crypto. But Fiatabusers enforce others to give it value. I would never use/buy bolivar on free will. Why the fuck you think there are spreading thousands of refugees now in venezuela, while they are not even in war or stuff?

am i talking this fucked language so badly? Bitcoin uses electricity. Bitcoin don´t create electricity. Renewable electricity production does not hurt the environment. Electricity produced by burning fossile fuels hurts the environment. This concludes thats only the last sentence is important for the topic of whats hurting the environment.
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:32:57
Aaah, i get it, your prices dont adjust, its a fake economy. Why don´t they just increase the electricity price the more kwh one buys? Sounds like a simple solution to me, no protesting, nothing. They would earn more money, build new renewables(jobs) and btc-mining don´t get so centralised over there.

@_date: 2017-08-29 16:33:13
less miners are needed
@_date: 2019-11-24 15:42:05
Is Bitpay now not usable any more with 0.19?
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:19:01
Is there now a chance to get Bitcoin-payouts in a lifetime for USB-Miners? Whats the minimum GH/s for like weekly payouts? Is there a reason why there are no lightning payouts?
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:27:40
It will go on. Forever. HODL
@_date: 2018-10-02 02:32:41
Why dont u use bitcoin/lightning to fix this? Like Editing costs 3 satoshis and if its a troll u can reverse it for 1 satoshi. So u can maybe even pay legit editors back. (maybe even with earnings).  I´m sure there are ways to prevent spam with bitcoin for your case. You could even scale the sats from 0-x on the amount of spamreverses (/over time).
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:06:31

@_date: 2018-06-11 01:10:39
Do people in Venezuela really still use bolivares to trade stuff outside banknumbers in the internet? i wonder why not 100% go full btc, or is the internet bad too?
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:06:43
we dont need the internet to stay connected. but it would be interesting to see how bitcoin could work then. maybe by stretching blockfinding time to 1 week/month, so you can drive by car around the world, collect transactions and share the new block. THIS would be an awesome altcoin i would help. :-)
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:20:03
Tell me where its placed, so i know if this could be my new source of sweets :D
@_date: 2018-06-19 10:07:12
most willingly high inflated fiat was used for war, right? sometimes i think war is and can be the only purpose of fiat -,-
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:29:27


i hope banks inflate your fiat by 50% so you learn you will get less, even if bitcoin gets cheaper.

@_date: 2019-08-19 05:49:15
yeah, that was the easy solution for OP. u can do the same with for example bitcoin core and dumpprivkey. if u dont trust satoshi, ur intelcpus or whatever just go fulloldschool pencil+brain xD

Actually if the receiving Address is a new Address (you should use bitcoin this way) then it can never be linked to an IP, because it could be build completly offline. When you broadcast a transaction someone can try to log where its coming from online. But even w/o anonymization tools its way better than banking/paypal/etc, where they know/sell/have to give away every information of you.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:11:17
I think the question is the answer. There is no way u can easily swap 1:1  shitcoins to btc. So if u are just a moneybitch don´t switch because of the fees except u got insider information that a big shitcoinhodler sells his crap and is short before crashing it.
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:13:44
yea the regime is raging again. i noticed it too, but bitpay still works here atm o.O

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:31:42
because these scammy exchanges are the new bankers. instead printing money they print different fees

Its called "Rundfunkbeitrag" and nearly every german has to pay for it currently 17,50€ each month. Some years ago it was for TV-shows (i didn´t know a single one who watched that) and some didn´t need to pay it if they proofed they had no TV (lol...). Now it seems like they are extending their trash to the internet so they can justify why everyone, no matter how poor, has to pay for it.
