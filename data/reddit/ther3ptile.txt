I don't hear anything.

 Oh damn I guess I was confused. This cleared a lot up though, thanks a ton.

 So with this info in mind, does anyone know which wallets will keep the users BTC as the "good" BTC?
 Will Blockchain, Bread or Copay convert it into the new BTC?
 I also see people discussing the ability to essentially "double" your BTC after the fork. How does this work?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:46:08
So for example, if I decide to download the Blockchain mobile wallet and deposit my BTC in there from Coinbase today and they announce that they’ll be using the other Bitcoin after the fork, will I have an opportunity to transfer my BTC to another wallet that will be using the normal BTC before it’s converted?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:48:54
This is a good example, I appreciate it. I’m going to check out some videos on them and decide what would be best for me.

 Adding on to this, how do we go about profiting from this? Will it be a separate balance that we can then sell or does it add on to our current balance?

 I'm still quite confused by this. What would it mean for me if my wallet was connected to the wrong network? Can I just switch it back to automatic and not send or receive any BTC during the fork and be fine?
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:44:10
 I see people saying this a lot but what do you mean when you say they can steal it? Would I just log onto my Coinbase account and find that all my bitcoins are gone or what?

I linked my debit card and it allowed me to do instant buying. I think if you use a bank account to buy, it takes longer.
 If you sell, you can only use a bank account to receive the payment so I know that takes up to 7 days. I don’t think there’s a way around that.
 As for transfers to wallets, I’m not sure. I haven’t transferred yet but I imagine that will probably take a few days as well.
 But if your looking to buy instantly, link a debit/credit card.

So is a paper wallet such as Breadwallet just as secure as a hardware wallet? If not, why? 
 Will I lose a lot in fees transferring my coins to my wallet and is there a simple way to check the value of my BTC once it is in the wallet or do I have to calculate the value myself? Coinbase shows the value of your owned coins on the main screen. Does a paper wallet do the same?

 What exactly is 2X and Segwit? I'm quite new to this.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:28:48
 So essentially after the fork, the "Normal" bitcoin will split into two? One will be the "bad" bitcoin and the other will be the "Good" bitcoin which will be the same as before? 
 And depending on what wallet I use, my normal BTC could be converted into the bad BTC? Is that about right?
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:38:55
 This is all bit over my head, I'll probably just minimize the risk and not mess with any of it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:15:33
 I just bought a few hundred worth on Coinbase. When this fork happens, will anything happen to the BTC on my Coinbase account? I don't know if I can justify buying a wallet yet.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:58:28
I’m wondering the same thing. I’m tempted to drop a few more hundred but I don’t know if it’ll go down any more.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:02:21
 I've never actually used a wallet, up until now I have only used Coinbase. 
 I realize that it is very important to use a mobile wallet but I am a bit confused on how the "nodes" work. If I use Bread and decide to connect to a normal Bitcoin node like you mentioned, will my BTC be safe for the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:27:52
So there’s no risk in me losing my normal BTC so long as I don’t spend any during that time frame? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:41:25
 As of right now, should I worry about connecting my Bread wallet to a core node? What does it connect to automatically and what is the importance of connecting to this node?
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:01:06
Speaking of this, what is a hard fork? I keep seeing people talk about it on here.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:26:47
So how do those hardware wallets work anyway? I understand that they’re like a flash drive. Is storing Bitcoin on those the same as just putting a file or something on a flash drive? How does that work?
 If I lose/break the hardware wallet, are those BTC gone?
Also, I’ve heard good things about “Bread”. Does it work as well as a hardware wallet? Are there fees when transferring to and from hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:14:39
So are you saying I’m at risk of losing my bitcoins if I never withdraw them from Coinbase? I plan to have around $225 invested so would it be worth it to transfer even with that much? Would I not lose a ton of profit in fees?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:16:45
So after the fork happens, is there a chance that my bitcoins will no longer be in my coinbase account? How does that work?
