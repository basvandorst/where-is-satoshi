Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. They’re blocking credit card purchases of crypto. With a credit card purchase, they’d be fronting the money, with the expectation that they’ll get paid back eventually. If people are suddenly maxing out their credit cards to buy crypto, and then having trouble paying it back, that hurts CapitalOne.
This is very different from them blocking debit card transactions or ACH transfers (which I haven’t heard them do recently), since that would be limiting what customers can do with their own money. They are fully justified, however, limiting what customers can do with CapitalOne’s money.

Surely he must recognize that if the government is increasingly devaluing people’s hard-earned money by irresponsibly printing more and more, people have the right to vote with their wallets and trade their labor for something else.
Or are the promises of choice &amp; democracy a lie? Are we literally slaves to the big banks, forced at gunpoint into their corrupt system (designed to funnel wealth from the many to the few through inflation)?
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:31:57
Yes, I made a statement which relates a lot of big, important concepts. Printing money to artificially prop up the stock market rewards people who have taken on irresponsible amounts of risk and punishes people who are just trying to save (by robbing them of any meaningful return on their money, while simultaneously reducing its purchasing power).
In short, reckless spenders (debtors) and the greediest investors are rewarded while savers suffer. This makes it harder for most income earners to provide for their families and/or ever retire.

It represents his current position. Hopefully that position changes and he doesn’t dig his heels in further.

To anyone reading this 1000+ years from now, the "F5 key" refers to a button within the top row of "function" keys on early human input devices called "keyboards." These function keys served a variety of purposes.

Precious metals have no price discovery mechanisms other than their related paper financial instruments. That is, no matter whether I buy physical gold online or at a local shop, my purchase doesn't show up in any publicly accessible records, so it doesn't affect the price. This opaqueness makes it easy for price manipulators to assert control.

With bitcoin, purchase &amp; sales data is exposed by most (all?) exchanges. The community is already using this real-world data to set the fair market value. Since there is no need for us to look at what the investment banks are doing whenever we want to know the current price of bitcoin, why would their incestuous IOUs affect the price (beyond the demand created when they settle their books)?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:34:24
Why would sites like coinmarketcap or cryptocompare switch to this reference rate when they can continue to consume exchange data?

Also, note they (the CME link) state that they're also consuming data from exchanges like GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:33:34
Please help me understand why CME will subject BTC itself (and existing exchanges) to further regulations. Regulations will continue to increase regardless, but I've viewed that as largely independent from what will happen related to futures trading. Coinbase, for example, already complies with strict KYC/AML regulations. As long as they don't start trading futures of their own, why would CME affect them? Honest question.

CME becoming the "official" spot price is only possible if the community lets that happen. Bitcoin is not a community that takes nicely to people trying to make "official" proclamations. Decentralization is the name of the game, and the idea of an official bitcoin spot price is actually pretty funny. Players gone get played.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:00:51
A reasonable point, but I don't fully buy the assertion that paper volume is the cause of opaqueness. It surely exacerbates the problem, but it's an inevitable outcome of not having public exchanges for precious metals. When gold was used as money, an exchange was a viable businesses model. Today it is cost prohibitive, especially since physical trading is costly when the userbase isn't geolocated (not a problem for crypto).
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:22:30
I guess I can only reply "we'll see about that" :)

("that" being the assertion that the CME price will be the arbiter of BTC's USD price - I can't take that as a given)
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:39:01
Another point to consider is that precious metals and other traditional commodities don't have centralized exchanges where the general public can participate.

Precious metals are efficiently exchanged in person, not online, and there just isn't enough demand anymore to justify having exchanges in retail locations where the average investor can trade small quantities. Coin shops are the closest there is, and there's been no coordinated effort amongst them to operate as true exchanges backed by an actual trading platform (i.e. one that publicly exposes pricing info). The only precious metals exchanges are for the big money investors who operate in large quantities and in many cases just deal in IOUs.

As a result, when the small fish go to trade amongst themselves, they don't have a good way to discover the fair market price except to look at what the big players are doing (e.g. the spot price in the case of precious metals). There is no central place to verify &amp; record the general public's trades, so these trades don't directly impact the spot price. In short, the general public is jerked around by a process where they have no input, so big money can easily manipulate prices.

With bitcoin, we **already** have exchanges used by the general public. Even if big money creates their own fancy IOUs and trade them on special elite exchanges, there's no reason for us to pay much attention to whatever prices they happen to charge amongst themselves. Why rely upon a proxy of the price (i.e. spot price) when you can look at the actual price that normal people are paying to buy &amp; sell bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:04:05
Unlike gold, it is easy to prove how many bitcoins these funds actually hold. A big part of commodity manipulation comes from funds that aren't necessarily fully backed by the commodities they purport to represent.

Edit: Here's Coinbase's response cited in that thread


Due to extremely high purchase and deposit volume, we have been experiencing a delay of several days with ACH deposits and buy orders. As a result, our estimated clearing date for your recent buy order or deposit was not accurate.
Bank transfers normally take 3-5 business days to complete. We try and make that expected delivery estimate as accurate as possible, and are always looking to improve it. Rest assured that your transfer is safe and the funds should arrive within the next couple business days.
We process bank payments using ACH transfers. You can find more information via our support page: support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/1392022-why-does-a-buy-take-so-long-
Also note that Saturday and Sunday are not bank business days, so keep in mind that buy and sell orders, along with ACH bank deposits and withdrawals, do not process on the weekend and will also delay an order.
We know that getting your funds quickly is extremely important to you, and we deeply apologize for this delay.
Thanks for bearing with us as we grow with the digital currency community.

To be fair, it's not necessarily a bad thing for your state to hold exchanges to a higher standard. If more states did this, there would be a higher number of reputable options to pick from. The fact that most exchanges don't want to bother complying with WA regulations (which requires they maintain a certain level of assets to back customer deposits) makes you wonder if your money is really safe, even if you don't leave money there for long.

&lt;COPY_PASTE&gt;

Sorry for the copy/paste from another thread, but there have been a couple recent posts about bitcoin units, and I'm interested in people's thoughts on this. Maybe I should start a separate post?

Imagine a convention where any crypto symbol (like BTC) could be expressed with a trailing number to indicate how far to move the decimal point. BTC-2, for example, would be the price of bitcoin with the decimal shifted 2 places to the left, which as I type this, yields $16.84.

I suspect this convention would require less mental gymnastics for most people to decode than using misc. letter prefixes, and it would be easy to apply broadly across the entire cryptosphere. The minus in "BTC-2" provides an obvious clue that this unit is less valuable than BTC, and it is easy to understand that every BTC has 10^**2** BTC-**2**. As the value of bitcoin grows, it would be simple to switch to, say, BTC-4. Every BTC has 10^**4** BTC-**4**, and to go from BTC-2 to BTC-4 simply requires you to move the decimal point another 2 spaces.

Having a + instead of a - would indicate to shift the decimal to the right, while providing a clue that this unit is MORE valuable than the base unit. So, DOGE+3 right now would be $1.20. Personally, this helps me form a more intuitive understanding of the value of each unit. It's hard for me to truly wrap my head around 1 unit of DOGE being worth $0.001203. That's such a small amount of money - how much DOGE would I need to have a meaningful amount? When I see that DOGE+3 = $1.20, I immediately understand that $1.20 buys me 10^3 (i.e. 1,000) DOGE.

Similarly, if I see prices of goods expressed in BTC, it's hard to rationalize. Is that 0.00235 BTC coffee a reasonable deal, or am I paying 10x more than I should? How many leading 0s did the price of my coffee have yesterday? A few... I think.

mBTC is okay as long as prices stabilize, but given that the space is evolving so fast, I'd much prefer a more flexible, self-describing option. That coffee is 2.35 BTC-3? Well, my coffee yesterday was 2.2 BTC-3, so I know I'm not totally blowing my budget today. I intuitively know that most prices these days, including for coffee, are expressed as BTC-3. If someone expresses their prices as BTC-4, I'm going to mentally convert to BTC-3 because that's what I'm used to. Someday if Bitcoin goes up another 10x, I'll shift my thinking to BTC-4. That will be easy because the unit self-describes how to convert to it.

Now, imagine exchanges and sites like coinmarketcap having a 1-click option to normalize **every** currency by using this convention to keep prices between $1 and $10 (or maybe between $1 - $100 by only using even suffixes). I know I'd more quickly recognize that DOGE, for example, is doing well by seeing DOGE+3 rise from $1.20 to $1.45, and it would be a particularly notable event when the suffix changed. Not that I'm into DOGE, but it was the least controversial coin I could think of :)

Agreed, but I think the problem right now is that most states are so lax that it's way more profitable for exchanges to play fast and loose, and just pull out of the states that have even reasonable restrictions. What WA regulation is over the top? I mean that as a genuine question - I'm not familiar with the details.

I'd hate for the solution to have to be for the federal government to step in. Is there any independent body working on this problem? I can imagine some independent organization giving their seal of approval to exchanges which meet a particular bar.
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:59:51
No. It is an honest attempt to solve a real problem that several people have mentioned. We are used to pricing things using relatively stable currencies which do not suffer from this problem. Stock prices run into a similar issue, and the accepted solution is to split the stock. Splitting a currency would have nasty repercussions, so a different solution is required. Ignoring the problem is an option, but some (including I) would argue this is causing a drag on BTC adoption and price growth.

I recognize the problem sounds trivial at first. It's easy to overlook the impact these sorts of "little things" can have.

@_date: 2017-07-25 19:01:53
I agree it's technically not a fork, but it's not just a regular altcoin either. BCC's pre-8/1 blockchain is **identical** to BTC, and it uses the **same underlying cryptography**. That means your BTC wallet address and private key create transactions which are also valid on BCC. There is some questionable "replay protection" in BCC, but it provides little (no) guarantees to protect your BTC.
If you don't ever touch the BCC blockchain, you don't have to worry (someone could steal your BCC but that doesn't impact your BTC). If you sell your BCC, however, you are transacting on the BCC blockchain using a transaction which may be valid in BTC, and your BTC is at risk. You don't have to worry if you explicitly split your coins before touching either blockchain.

As the value of bitcoin grows, it would be simple to switch to, say, BTC-4. Every BTC has 10^**4** BTC-**4**, and to go from BTC-2 to BTC-4 simply requires you to move the decimal point another 2 spaces.

Having a + instead of a - would indicate to shift the decimal to the right, while providing a clue that this unit is MORE valuable than the base unit. So, DOGE+3 right now would be $1.20. Personally, this helps me form a more intuitive understanding of the value of each unit. It's hard for me to truly wrap my head around 1 unit of DOGE being worth $0.001203. That's such a small amount of money - how much DOGE would I need to have a meaningful amount? When I see that DOGE+3 = $1.20, I immediately understand that $1.20 buys me 10^3 (i.e. 1,000) DOGE.

Similarly, if I see prices of goods expressed in BTC, it's hard to rationalize. Is that 0.00235 BTC coffee a reasonable deal, or am I paying 10x more than I should? How many leading 0s did the price of my coffee have yesterday? A few... I think.

mBTC is okay as long as prices stabilize, but given that the space is evolving so fast, I'd much prefer a more flexible, self-describing option. That coffee is 2.35 BTC-3? Well, my coffee yesterday was 2.2 BTC-3, so I know I'm not totally blowing my budget today. I intuitively know that most prices these days, including for coffee, are expressed as BTC-3. If someone expresses their prices as BTC-4, I'm going to mentally convert to BTC-3 because that's what I'm used to. Someday if Bitcoin goes up another 10x, I'll shift my thinking to BTC-4. That will be easy because the unit self-describes how to convert to it.

Now, imagine exchanges and sites like coinmarketcap having a 1-click option to normalize **every** currency by using this convention to keep prices between $1 and $10 (or maybe between $1 - $100 by only using even suffixes). I know I'd more quickly recognize that DOGE, for example, is doing well by seeing DOGE+3 rise from $1.20 to $1.45, and it would be a particularly notable event when the suffix changed. Not that I'm into DOGE, but it was the least controversial coin I could think of :)

It is meant to protect against a bank going under (e.g. during a bank run), because the bank was irresponsible and greedy with depositor money. With crypto, you are your own bank. The fact that banks “need” FDIC insurance, which won’t actually be able to make savers whole if there’s ever a currency crisis (hint: there will be one) is a check in the bitcoin column, not vice versa.
Also, FDIC insurance is, ironically, a big part of the dollar’s underlying problem. Without such insurance, depositors would actually care what their bank was doing with their money. Consumers would get educated and we wouldn’t be dealing with this moral hazard where banks are encouraged to take the biggest risks they can get away with. Of course, growth would appear to be slower, but it would be real growth, not kindling for the next forest fire.

And the idea that FDIC insurance is a factor which favors the dollar is hilarious if you understand what it is protecting against and why that’s moot for bitcoin.

Nope, I’m not saying that, nor am I in the mood to converse with someone who is clearly attempting to mischaracterize what I’m saying. Good day, sir.
