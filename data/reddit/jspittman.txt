have you sold (BTC to USD transaction) yet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:51:18
it will be taxed at the same rate you pay from working, assuming it was less a less than one year hodling period (but no social security or medicare payments will need to be paid)

Sort of -- that's called ordinary income, also called short-term capital gain.  All trades over 1 year are taxed at the longer-term capital gains rate.
The IRS taxes crypto as property ( and does not consider it currency.  It views is more like a house, stock, a car, etc.
A crypto trader needs to determine the gain and loss on each trade, and report such.  Kind of a pain, sure, but it's by the book.
FYI I have an accounting background/degree, but not CPA, just for disclosure.

Ahhh, ok that explains it.  All about the transaction fees ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:44:36
"more than one year" - long term capital gain
 
"one year or less" - short term capital gain / ordinary income

I really like this change.  I've found iConsumer is a hard sell to my friends and others, even though it's a totally legit gig.
Anyhow, I for one am very happy with this switch from fiat to Bitcoin payouts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:57:09
so you've just traded crypto to crypto?  like BTC to ETH, then ETH to BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:38:51
They prob right.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:38:56
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:11:24
they could be the same person (two wallets)
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:21:26
An interesting development.  Bitcoin is becoming a more of "store of value", instead of a transactional platform.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:23:48
As long I can Bing to search for coins, I’m good
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:42:24
Love this question.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:12
Prob not
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:21:39
Intrinsic value Bitcoin.  Now there’s an idea.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:42:41
Nothing specific, I'm afraid.  Not sure how deductions work in Sweden or Poland, but if you're trading a lot you could try turning it into a business and taking deductions for expenses.  A much more involved process, but might be an option.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:49:44
you'll pay the tax when you file your 1040 (annual return) next year.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:11
Damn right
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:03:14
if you haven't sold, you're good to go.  just hodl
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:48:12
my understanding is yes.  but i've heard talk of an exclusion of a certain amount that may be trying to be passed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:45:35
We would all have to donate our Bitcoin to the church.  Then they could sell it.
And the church would support us, I guess?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:23:27
That's pretty awesome.  "Magic Internet Money" indeed :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:46:49
whatever your ordinary income tax rate is.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:26:25
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:26:10
It happens -- at least you rode it from $24 to $5,000 + 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:04
was this the nicehash hack?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:31
way to go!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:36
Lost $100
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:57:48
have you sold any BTC yet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:26
bet you're right
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:56:29
i'll follow up -- my understanding is if you made a trade, a buy then a sell, that you need to calculate the gain / loss from that, and every other trade.  that is how it would work with stocks, real estate, etc. i'll follow up and confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:42
What the hell is this, and how can I buy it?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:44:28
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:34:42
but if you can do some with the fiat now that makes your life better NOW, then that can have significant value.  perhaps more than the future value of hodling bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:12
If you're in the US, pay your taxes.  Long term capital gains.  15%, no biggie.
I have an accounting background.  Don't f*ck with the IRS.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:14:00


Interesting -- the same problem that *deflation* causes for a currency.  Perhaps *inflation* has a benefit for a currency but isn't good for a store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:07:10
5000 within the week?  That'd be awesome 
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:44:01
hope not
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:14:53
This is insane!
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:44:21
well done!
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:37:09
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:43:23
So true :D
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:07:42
yeah, that'd make it slow.  we're lucky to have 100/100 fiber here, so we're putting it to use 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:33
That’s the one.  10k by 2017.  So far, so good.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:47:38
The time traveler was right ��
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:35:55
Yes- plz allow us to set our fee!
