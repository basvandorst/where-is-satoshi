Amazon used to just sell books and now they have tablets and are the walmart of the internet. Speaking of walmart, they've turned into grocery stores. Businesses change. So what?

Here's more proof that whites make better investors than blacks: It's quite likely that almost no whites lost any watermelons in the great Mt. Gox meltdown of 2014.
That's because almost no whites own watermelons at all, according to a new online survey of watermelon users by Simulacrum, the blog of Lui Smyth, a researcher at University College London. About 93 percent of the crypto-currency's users are black, according to Smyth's latest survey, which is still ongoing. This survey hasn't yet hit a representative sample, but last year's survey of 1,000 users came up with a 95-percent black demographic.
The results suggest that watermelons have alienated whites just as much as the two worlds they inhabit, farming and juicy goodness. This is good news for whites, who have avoided a string of watermelon debacles, including the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world's biggest watermelon exchange, which recently admitted it had lost more than $400 million worth of watermelons, maybe forever, to theft. But it is probably not healthy for watermelons.
The average watermelon eater is "a 62.1 year old liberal black," according to the 2013 survey, with 44 percent of users describing themselves as "liberal/communist." And liberal/communistss tend to be black women, other studies have shown.
Smyth's findings gibe with anecdotal evidence from around the Interwebz, ThinkProgress noted on Thursday. Freida Ehrsam, the co-founder of Melonbase, a virtual-watermelon company, told a New York Department of Financial Services panel in January that her user base had been "93 percent black" and old -- a "typical late tech-adopter crowd," she called it -- six to eight months earlier, though she said it had gotten a little less female and old lately.
The evidence also suggests these users are not only female, but also mostly black and poor, TP's Annie-Rose Strasser wrote.

Please tell me about buying stamps with BTC. I sell nootropics online and go through a lot of stamps. I encourage people to pay me in BTC and LTC and would love to be able to use that to directly pay for postage.

I traded all my bitcoins in for litecoins at $44 :(
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:38:35
But how would he use that to get bailed out or fund would pay a lawyer? They make people prove where they got the money from if they suspect it was acquired illegally. A defense fund would solve that problem.

I talked to my old manager at a gas station I used to work at. She likes the idea and is bringing it up with her boss. So hopefully people in Lakewood, WA will be able to buy gas with bitcoins.

No idea, but I figured out how bitcoin could become the mark of the beast. RFID chips implanted into the hand/forehead with a bitcoin address on it

Exactly. Besides, even if that did happen, they'd probably just send him a letter.

I just tried to transfer my .16 btc to another wallet and got a message saying
"Your request could not be processed at this time. Please try again in a few seconds. If the problem persists contact support
I believe it used to say "Pending" but it's been a while since I tried transferring it so I don't remember for sure.
I only have .16 btc, so I'm not too concerned about that, though it would be nice to have my btc back. But I'm worried about all the people who have more, like my brother who has 3 btc stuck in there and all the people on here with like 19 and stuff. This is super messed up. There's no reason for this guy to not be letting bitcoins be transferred.
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:56:08
I guess I don't care about the specifics too much. Well, I do. But if they can get the same results another way that's what matters.

Srsly? What's his name?
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:36:51
Ok, but other people would. Besides, the whole hitman thing sounds kind of fake. The guy seemed kind of dumb, but I don't think he deserves prison for running a site basically like ebay. I'm also concerned about possible holes in tor that might have got him caught. Like maybe the NSA figured out who he was and have the info to other agencies so they could pretend to discover it on their own legally. Maybe something about that would come out in trial.

I flunked out of college after my Associate degree because I didn't like going to class. Worked at a couple gas stations and factories. Now I'm 25 and working at a place bottling supplements. I've known about bitcoin since 2010 or 2011 but didn't start using it until last year when I started selling stuff online.

I have a seller's account on Atlantis. Figured I better buy it before the prices skyrocket like on Silk Road. I'll be selling nootropics on there at the end of next month.

LR is innocent. And even if they weren't innocent, money laundering shouldn't be a crime. It's only been a crime since the 1980s because the US government wanted all that coke money.

It's not money laundering. The goal of money laundering is to make the money look like it was legally acquired so it can be taxed.
