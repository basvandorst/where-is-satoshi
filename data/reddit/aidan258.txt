Its been suggested a couple times, I will have to look into it.

HAHA that would be gold. Have it blinking as well with a little loading animation. 
Unfortunately, that's a bit above my coding level at the moment though. Maybe in the future.

While its a great list. I don't think its complete, it also doesn't have the prices readily available :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:37:25
Sure just please link it :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:26:42
Thanks I was bored and felt like practicing a bit of coding lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:48:23
LMAO wow this is why I love reddit. So many creative ideas.
If you can find me a parts list I could implement this potentially.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:58:45
Its on its way.

Lol just waiting on that lambo/btc ticker now

Most of the website is simple HTML/CSS design. I had to use php/json to grab the price info and do math though.
Honestly googled most of it.

Well guys I'm headed to bed, thanks for all the support!
Since this post, my sites had ~10k hits in the past 4 hours.
 Roughly 1500 per 30 min.
Its been fun coding practice and I will look into implementing some of your suggestions in the coming days. Fingers crossed HostGator doesn't kick me off for too much traffic.

Currently BitPay. Although I was considering switching it to CoinMarketCap.

Just waiting on BTC/LAMBO Parity now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:13:45
I'll also take the bitcoin equivalent.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:58:33
added. Thanks for the idea :)

If you look at the column/row you will see which pairs are being compared.
A correlation of 1 means that these pairs move up/down in price perfectly together. A correlation of -1 means that the pair moves up/down completely opposite.
Correlation analysis is used by many investors in order to balance their portfolio and protect themselves from risk.
Here is a quick video explanation that goes a little more in-depth.

Pairs are pulled from Binance's top 200 (volume wise) cryptocurrencies.

After doing some research and being unable to find a good correlation matrix with more than ~20 Cryptocurrencies on it. I decided to create my own and thought I would share! It's interesting to see what is correlated and what is not.
