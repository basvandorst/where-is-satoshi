Yeah remember when people said Bitcoin was a ponzi? 
@_date: 2016-08-11 03:00:07
Nope. What if the event is canceled will I get my BTC back or USD? What if the BTC value has lowered. That being said paying with BTC is super risky if there was an issue with the tickets.

Wonder where bitfinex got their idea ffrom
@_date: 2016-08-10 03:31:52
Monero is a pretty solid investment if Bitcoin is unable to add these features. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:35:09
LTC and Monero are the only coins with that were not pre-mined on this list. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 16:16:31
CDMA does as well.
@_date: 2015-12-11 05:50:38
I think that was part of the article someone posted. Since you were "compromised" you now have to change your password and be locked out of withdrawing for a certain amount of time.

The hype is what will give it impact.

Still paying 2.98 a gallon idk about you. In theory with inflation that means it's probably less. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 03:27:49
How much BTC? ;)
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:09:57
Every different Linux distro is an 'altcoin'. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 07:49:40
Instant is mostly always instant. First buys probably have to wait 30 days before you can buy instantly. Tbh i havent used cb in years because support blows. Circle is x10 better. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 18:52:08
Pretty similar to what happened with Litecoin.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:58:59
So will each company/service have it's own Lightning Network? What so different from this than banks using 'blockchain' technology?

Idk how big Cryptsy is but people think they have "goxxed".
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:59:24
During: A seperate market emerged for people to sell their "gox coins" for dirt cheap. It was a super risky investment because no one knew if they were going to get their coins back but some people wanted to get some sort of cash I imagine. TBH not sure what actually happened to that site. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 18:50:55
Yep 2016 is looking like a moon year.
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:41:26

DDOS. Also I did not get any email from BTC-E or anyone claiming to be BTC-E.
@_date: 2017-02-03 18:31:49
I've started using LTC to move across exchanges during high unconfirmed transaction times. It's faster and works just like BTC, which makes you wonder why it's so undervalued. 
Sadly, Yesterday I had to use ETH to cash out via Coinbase because transactions were so backed up. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 05:24:14
Let's say I knew private key to one of these addresses. How does one enter it and claim it? How would someone brute force it? Im not technical enough to do it myself, but Id love to know the process.
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:38:48
This picture is money seized from the mexican cartel. 404 terrorist not found. Pretty sure they'd shy away from doing anything that would close the borders.

 Can you just send my tip to a charity? Not sure if thats how it works. Thank you for this post!
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:18:29
The Venmo app kind of comes close. It's usually 1-2 days for transfers and it's so much better than finding a ATM to pay back your friends.
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:43:57
Is it still up if you cant use it? 
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:21:39
Props to user Darren Kis for tipping in the soundcloud comments via ChangeTip. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 16:28:29
And to be fair Litecoin adopts a lot of things Bitcoin does. So in a way Bitcoin tests a lot of things for Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:04:41
Similar to Facebook?  (Not sure just guessing) then it might be time to buy.
@_date: 2016-03-28 22:03:14
Used my CC info to singup, and started paying with BTC instead. Now they are wanting me to send them my ID. No idea why but it makes me not want to use them anymore. Any decent alternatives? Vultr is just as bad.
@_date: 2017-03-31 22:51:03
they will look mighty fine along side confidential transactions ;)

@_date: 2016-01-19 18:27:17
Yes and  is still running today.

Funny how Litecoin upcoming roadmap seems to match satoshi's vision better than btc.
@_date: 2018-10-27 02:24:23
Lol most exchanges charge you to move this magic internet money...about $5 usd ROFL
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:13:41
Idk Litecoin seems pretty secure and will vote for segwit in 3 days.
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:04:51
Fully expect a dump around that time.
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:04:00
Just wait until you find out the ether devs put money into the DAO. One up to 100k and are now trying to fork it to get the "stolen" ether back.

People give Charlie so much shit for it. Sorry @_date: 2015-08-07 15:17:35
Venmo is mostly free and instant for now. (I have yet to pay a dime.) The longest you'll ever wait is 1 business day for your $ to be deposited into your bank account. Pretty sure if you ever decide to go from BTC to USD (bank) it would take 3-4 business days to arrive.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:25:23
This just gives you a clue that Satoshi was a pack rat. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 02:42:15
Had the opposite experience. Coinbase didnt want me as a customer. Circle has been great so far. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 21:35:06
Damn I got in early and had something like a 1k-2k instant buy. No way in hell did I deserve that limit amount. It really sucked when coinbase required a cc for instant buys. They couldn't verify my address for whatever reason.
@_date: 2015-08-23 13:45:15
Please provide sources on your %numbers there. I doubt DNM is down due to visibility. If anything its because no one has the balls to create a market with integrity. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:29:34
My thoughts exactly. If soundcloud 'visually' incorporated it into their system it would work better. Still that would feel rather gimmicky to me. Maybe soundcloud could set up some sort of reward or early access to a certain artist if you tip them.

The first few times Ive bought btc from circle, my banks fraud dept called about me buying a money order in some other state. The amounts matched what I spent in circle so Ive always approved the charges. Idk why but that has always seemed shady to me. Local CU hasnt banned me yet tho. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:46:03
Chiggers can be annoying man. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:51:01

@_date: 2016-02-22 00:55:09
Most exchanges charge CC fees that I know of. Some even warn it might be seen as a cash advance by your CC company.
@_date: 2015-07-11 02:01:58
People said the same thing about Bitcoin and that it would never be taken seriously.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:32:47
Bitcoin has somewhat been a testnet for Litecoin for a while now. Activating Segwit would sort of reverse those roles. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:03:12
There isn't very many transaction going on in the LTC network. Because of Segwit the price has shot up, and if transactions spill over from BTC...well that means more money for miners (off of lightening network)
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:56:24
Maybe in 30 years or so.
@_date: 2015-07-11 02:27:35


The first part of your post. Like I restated in mine----&gt; Bitcoin would never be taken seriously. S-e-r-i-o-u-s-l-y.

I believe the halving hype and a ponzi scheme took the price to 8. Its settled nicely at 2x the pre halving price after the dump. So far Litecoin has been pretty solid.

Any links to this? I've always kind of suspected the Wordfence security people targeting Wordpress installs so they can sell their 'premium' feature.

There were a lot of people who invested at those prices who might want to get out. I doubt it will go that high but you never know with BTC maturing.

Sure and all of those other cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:59:18
I believe Vitalik said they did not code ETH hard fork to prevent this because of time constraints aka rushing the hard fork.
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:48:26

This comment. Gold. Pure bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:27:12
WOW. Similar experience here. I got mine 5-7 hours later when the BTC had spiked. It was ridiculous...BTC was LOW ALL DAY. BTC spiked and POW I get shafted about 30USD....it just seemed very odd for that to happen.
edit: never doing Bitinstant into a direct BTC address or Mt. Gox again. I found out Bitfloor has direct wire at BoA for a cheaper fee and you get USD so you can control when you buy the BTC. It is not as instant but 24 hours is good enough for me.
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:49:53
