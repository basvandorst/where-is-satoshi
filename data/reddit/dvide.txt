If I'm right, it's not even good for routing high-value transactions as it's much cheaper to do it on chain even with the 0.01 BTC payment example I gave. And since the amount being forwarded is multiplied by the 'feerate' value, the routing fee would become even higher for higher value transactions.
If you tried to send 0.16 BTC ($1,290) for example, his node would want to charge a 0.017 BTC ($137) routing fee. For a comparison, with the LND fee values at their defaults, the fee for forwarding 0.16 BTC would be 0.00000017 BTC (17 satoshis) ($0.0014) instead.

I'm reluctant to even write this post, because I feel like I'm missing something and I feel stupid. I haven't played around with lnd or lightning myself yet. But I'm gonna ask anyway, and if I'm totally wrong about everything forgive me.
Why do you keep raising those fee values by so much? I don't get it.
You seem to be trying to raise the fees until people stop opening channels with you? But why do you think that raising the routing fee will accomplish this? It's a fee for each and every payment that you route through your hop, not a one-off fee for opening a channel with you. Right? And since you're gaining a reputation for being a large hub with a lot of capacity, a lot of people are just gonna manually open a channel with you. But then they can't really use you as a hub anyway, since your fees are so high (but they probably don't know that before they do it).
In part two of your review, you said you had raised both the fee values by a factor of 100. And then in this part of your review, you raised the fee values again massively to this:
    bitcoin.basefee=100000000
    bitcoin.feerate=100000
In part two of your review, you showed [this image](


This is in millisatoshis, or thousandths of a satoshi. We use 10^8 as a multiplier to get from BTCs to satoshis, but with millisatoshis we will need to use 10^11. 
So for example, with your own experiment with the Eclair wallet, you were attempting to send 0.01044003949 BTC to Blockstream using your lnd.shitcoin.com node as a hop. So unless I'm mistaken about how it works, your node would want to charge your Eclair wallet this fee for routing the payment:
`(100000000 + ((0.01044003949 * 10^11) * 100000 / 1000000)) / 10^11`
Which equals ~0.002 BTC ($16.75)! This is a much more expensive fee than it would be to just do on chain! So maybe your Eclair wallet failed because it recognized that this was a ridiculous routing fee and decided that it's not a valid route, even though you did have the available BTC in your channel to pay this fee. But this is a good thing, or else novice users will end up paying insane fees by accident if they just open one channel with your node and then try to buy something (like you did).
So it's really no wonder that you're not making much money from routing fees. It makes no sense to route through you, as opposed to around you. Put it this way: if all other nodes have their fee values set to their defaults, and you just increase the 'basefee' value by a factor of 100 (adding two zeros, as you keep doing), then routing through your node is only the cheapest path if they can't find another path that's less than 100 hops! Since each other hop is charging a 1 satoshi fee, and you're charging 100 satoshis for just 1 hop, it would only be cheaper to pay through your hop if the only other alternative routes are more than 100 hops long. And you've increased this value now by a factor of 100,000!
Frankly I'm surprised you even made the 30 cents that you did in your last post. But maybe you made all that before you jacked up your fees so high.
Unless, like I say, I'm being stupid and not understanding something obvious. This is the most likely scenario!

Oh, I didn't notice that. does this line mean that before using the Eclair wallet, you reset the fees to LND's defaults, or does it mean you merely reset them to the previous value (which was already pretty high)? And are you now forwarding more payments since you reset the fees?
