@_date: 2016-04-12 20:00:20
I agree. They do not become more rare. Every Bitcoin up to this point is still existing. The rate of new bitcoins is slowed down, but this was planned and known since day 1.

I've decided not to use Circle anymore since they took way to long to accept my invite. You lost a potential loyal customer and his network of crypto friends for taking too long. Not that you care about one person.
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:34:50
It's true. He tried telling us last week. People are so scared after the "starbucks is accepting next week" trolls all year long. But he actually was telling the truth.

What I like most, is that most IT people who have the potential to understand bitcoin's innerworking will now see these How-to's from newgg, dell, tigerdirect and start to wonder if it's worth looking into. They all shop on these 3 sites all day as it is at my retails shops (bestbuy employee)

@_date: 2014-07-11 14:18:32
Actually he has a good point. He is trying to state that we don't have enough 1 full bitcoins for everyone, I get that, and understand the divisibility issue.  he is trying to say about the price is if 1 bitcoin was $10,000 then a person could "live" off 0.001btc and not need 1.00btc for $600 like today.
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:32:52

Seems likely. Although I also doubt no one has bought that much in one swoop recently as we would see it in the order books if they did, it bugs me when people assume getting that many coins from point of purchase to new address costs a total of $0.04

you dont need xcp. you just transfer btc to your counterparty wallet. then tranfer that btc to the crowdfund address. They detect you have a counterparty wallet and send you storjcoins

You got me there. TBH
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:01:06
Yeah, or cash back. Ebay would have converted the btc to fiat immediately so it would most likely have a reserve of cash to refund the original price paid.  "DAMN, wait this is exploitable now that I think about it"

I agree 100%. If its free to fund your circle account from google wallet. and its also free to use debit/credit on google wallet then this is an amazing loop hole. 
as it stands tho..your paying two middle men to use btc, just for NFC access.

Also as a use case, how effective have governments been at killing Bittorrent? Is it still around? Are people still downloading Game of Thrones? Why yes, they are. Will they stop? No, they won't. This is peer to peer MONEY. There is little else more powerful to humankind. It is analogous to a virus injected into the financial system that will circumvent foolish regulations like these by growing around them.You think Bittorrent was big? You have no idea what is about to happen.

When I woke up and saw the top posts. I told myself not to panic if bitstamp was at $100 each ....I was shocked to see a mini rally from 409 to  500
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:15:18
Is this the answer everyone was hoping for? or am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:05:28
I LOL'd too hard at this

Damn you make a very good point. I wish I thought of that. Roommate hell is trechorous

The league of legends pro player Doublelift just got a tip asking him to look into accepting bitcoin. He then seemed very interested and starting googling it on stream at twitch.tv
@_date: 2014-08-13 04:13:48

This makes me want to open a website and sell my services to everyone. I don't even have a business, but I wan't one so bad now.

@_date: 2014-10-06 04:27:08

My guess people were speculating that the NY guidelines from Lawsky would be positive and bring on a rally of some sort. When they quickly realized 1500 comments later, everyone went pitchfork mode, they closed their longs.

I think the majority of people interested In storj are people ready to start mining/farming with storage space they have free.  What might be keeping most away is no drive share working public beta yet

Yup. Old news

It's charged like that NOW but that's an error. They are working on making it so that it's charged like a purchase of goods. *Imagine the points you could rack on buying and selling and paying off the card*

@_date: 2014-01-10 18:37:21
You almost could of lost your chance at buying a high number of bitcoins under 4 digits if the price didnt fall exactly like you planned and somehow you fell asleep as Amazon press releases they accept bitcoin. 
TL:DR-too risky selling 100% all on bad news

That is exactly right. Also don't get a big head and try to "save the world" just because your in the green.   
Truthfully I've been waiting for an opportunity to do something noble once I had enough money. The thing I learned is...maybe you dont need to be rich to help people. I don't know why I'm waiting for more money just to live a dream to help people

But what about the people not wanting to pay bitcoin? Won't you lose a lot of your demo?
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:10:12
Actually yeah, everyone one of my friends when explained how bitcoin work are first angry they didn't get in at $5 then say its stupid to now. Hate it
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:24:41
My family is looking into bitgo now thanks to him.
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:49:15
Sorry if I came off haste, I actually contributed in the crowdfund and I fully understand the time it takes to make sure it works. I only meant to add input of why my co-workers tell me when I ask them to look into this.
Looking forward to this whenever it may be!

It will be worth 1 Bitcoin.  It's hard to tell if everyone will hold and $300m comes in as pure bids or if people will profit take all the way. Too hard to give a price.

Does it hurt? Having multiple of both?
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:10:16
Wanna rethink that again? It could have easily fell to $0.10 but because you see it in retrospect you assume it was 0 risk?
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:06:44
We'll never see $500 again!

Good question
@_date: 2015-04-23 03:44:55
Isn't Gemini waiting for the bitlicense? The sooner they have an official license released, the sooner big companies can become compliant and feel safe enough to go all in? Just my ignorance talking out loud.

Fuck yeah. I'd go
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:31:19
This I agree with 100%. Rumors of pokerstars implementing btc deposits. Well see......

I was interested in a Twitch plays bitcoin poker. Let them raise or fold or call. But they would probably make me lose all my money, just to watch the world burn. LOL
@_date: 2015-04-28 05:05:03
Let's say he bought 3Xs as much, you would argue he should of only bought 1/3 and spread the big buys. So you never know there may be even bigger buys coming.....

I'm stating fact's and you downvote? lol all I said was the only negative effect. For instance, imagine finding out there's a flaw found that allows double spending in the next 3 months; you would have your locked in 1.7m worth of GBTC with no option to panic sell like the rest of us for 9 more months after the fact. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:34:48
dont forget Archcoins.

I run an educational bitcoin stream on twitch.tv/bitcoin_Louie. I  play on bitcoin poker/casino sites while playing Andreas Antonopolous videos. In chat I would give 100 bits to all users every 10 minutes
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:52:00
This is pretty damn cool
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:05:21
That cant happen, there will always be a price someone is willing to pay, could be $1 for all the bitcoins or it could be $1 down from the market price even it means they can resell on the exchanges for only $1 profit. Profit is profit.  Then from there the people fight it out to razer thin profit margin's.
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:16:55
is it though?

@_date: 2015-03-05 20:08:48
yeah no way to enforce that pegged price if it's in an open market.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:07:58
how would the exchange transfer the ownership if you still have the private key? Doesn't sound like a good idea to me.

Basically what you are doing is attempting to display yours coins benefits, I get that. But in this context it comes off as begging. Just like people in litecoin believe their coin is most functional, coinbase is saying we don't care and we have decided to focus on bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:47:02

I'm happy to see people posting positive reviews. I'm tired of seeing only people whining when they don't profit in some way from coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:32:05
I don't know about you guys but they basically are giving us a WIN/WIN. I was able to buy bitcoins with the fear of getting "High risked" and the price drops I would save money. But if it goes UP, I would ask politely they honor the price.  I'm NOT saying to exploit them, but be very happy they are doing this for you.

You can buy 4 btc with a small loan from the bank. If bitcoin works out you make $10,000+

I would guess they are getting micro transactions of BTC at a time, for less then the cost of mining. Although probably same amount of hardware required to upkeep.

I've spent thousands and stopped buying bitcoins because I couldnt afford a whole bit coin. I'm not dumb..I knew I could buy .5 or .1 but I just....didn't want to anymore. It felt way better buying 10 at a time.

0.0234 bitcoins got me a large pizza at poppa johns. I used that much to buy me a $10 gyft card first then bought it online and picked up the pizza myself to save $4

What you said it very true and for the future of bitcoin to succeed. We need to not stroke each other to death. lol

I applaud your bravery. The hardest step is just BUY your first bitcoin asap. From then on after, I recommend buying when the price drops and purchasing cool things on gyft.com while the price is all time high. and repurchase even more when the drop happens.
So far I'm doing amazing from following this. Good luck!!

esp with them earning 1% of 800 bitcoin. Back when it was $10 they were giving away 50% profit for referals.
