Nope. For all practical purposes, there is an infinite number of coins available; they're just not all called bitcoin. If there is a crypto mass adaption one day, you can bet your sweet satoshi people won't be willing to fight over 21 million coins when 95% is already held by early adopters and a few ballers. Either there will be many cryptocurrencies or one that is not bitcoin.

Repeat post: Short term gains (under a year) are just added to your regular taxable income. So whatever tax bracket you're in after adding your regular income and your crypto gains, that's the rate you pay.

True! Or whatever awful race Jar-Jar Binks is.

I think that's probably the case in most countries, but yes. Long term gains have a more favorable tax rate than short term.

Maaaybe if you live and work in downtown San Francisco and pay every single tax you can possibly pay. But the Pew Research Center's metric is one of the most widely accepted definitions of "middle class." This article also mentions a couple of alternative definitions.
Note that these are *gross* incomes. With a $260,000 net income you are firmly in the "baller" category by any metric. ;)

Here is one thing most non-Americans don't understand that answers your question: America is - much more so than other developed countries - a winner and loser society. Most non-Americans don't understand how drastic this is in the US. All the stereotypes about Americans are true: Americans are unhealthy, Americans are uneducated, Americans don't have access to affordable healthcare. 
BUT at the same time, the opposite is also always true: Americans are VERY healthy, VERY well educated, and have access to EXCELLENT healthcare. It just depends on which side you're on. And unlike many developing nations with a very small rich elite and the majority of people being poor, America has a large percentage of people on the winning side. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that many of those are just fine with the status quo and are willing to defend it.

I gotta be honest. I cashed out three times this year, and that's going to be what I report. I won't probably report the 43 times I exchanged peecoin for poopcoin and made or lost a dollar. That way, I pay the relevant taxes and don't go crazy. In the unlikely event I get into trouble, I don't owe the IRS a significant amount of money.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:40
That's a reason to sell pretty soon, though, because you can be certain that there will be some sort of Abgeltungssteuer for crypto gains in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:40:27
Oh, I see. I thought you were older. I do think it makes sense to put a bit into crypto with every paycheck. However, never underestimate the gains from traditional investments. Compounding interest is a powerful thing. Take a look at this very handy calculator: 
Just as an example: You start with $1,000 and put in another $150 every month for 30 years. Assuming all gains are reinvested (i.e. you don't cash any money out) and a modest 5% average gain per year, after 30 years, you are looking at close to  $124,000. All that for just the price of an overpriced cable TV subscription. 
Crypto is tricky. It's by no means certain that the price of so many digital currencies will continue to rise at a steady rate. Why would it? If there is a point of mass adaption for monetary exchange at some point, high value is counterproductive. Why would someone (or a company or institution) buy into an insanely expensive currency when it's perfectly possible to create an unlimited number of new compatible blockchains?

Next time you consider doing something dumb like this, don't do it. But if you make any profits in the near future, which I hope you will, pull out your initial investment as quickly as you can. Your potential future gains will be less spectacular, but sleep is better when you play with house money.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:18:03
15% if you hedl for a year or longer. Otherwise it's short-term capital gains and simply added to your taxable income, meaning your rate is whatever your income tax rate is.

So, take this with a grain of salt because I'm by no means an expert, but you don't need to actually provide that info - you just need to have it in case you get audited. All you need to submit is a number: your profit minus your cost basis. If you use Turbotax or something like that to do your taxes, it will ask you at some point if you had income from investments.

I'm sorry, what? Other parts of the world have advanced much faster in fiber technology, which is a wired technology, than us. Granted, we're a big country, but there is A LOT more competition in most of Europe and many Asian countries, and as a result prices are quite a bit lower. The secret to competition is to make the last mile to the customer's home free for all, i.e. to force providers to let other ISPs use that last mile. It's an un-American pill to swallow, so I doubt this is going to happen here anytime soon, but it dramatically reduces the costs of creating an ISP.

No need for national infrastructure. Just allow communities create their own ISPs. In many places, that's the case, but a large number of states have legislation that protects the monopolies of the legacy carriers.

Weeeeell, I have a couple of really good ones. Used responsibly, they are a good tool since retailers usually price in CC fees, so you pay them even if you pay cash everywhere. But I had some travels and shenanigans in the past that caused one of my cards to blow up a bit. I regret nothing, but I'll be happy to see that balance gone, and that particular fucker will actually be canceled, yes. The way I see it, no credit card debt = instant 12% gains. Pale compared to crypto this year, but a hell of a lot better than the average stock market gains.

is right in this case, though. A number of states have legislation that prevents communities from creating their own ISP if it threatens the profits of established ISPs. I hope the FCC ruling will cause a massive backlash to happen in those states.

No, gold is actually quite a bit heavier than lead since it's a lot denser. There aren't many metals that are as dense/heavy as gold, and even fewer of those are cheaper.

Tungsten is pretty much the only metal with a comparable density that is affordable. You'd have to make a gold coated tungsten bar since tungsten has an entirely different color. It's done, but it's not easy to do especially in jewelry.

Because you don't want to make a case for the value of crypto based on the lack of value of fiat. If someone is looking for a safe haven asset because they are worried about (hyper-)inflation, there are MUCH better investments than crypto (e.g. precious metals, property). Also, USD inflation has been excellent in recent years, so it's not an argument most people are interested in right now. The argument for crypto should be its growth potential and its potential for a more democratic monetary system.

Interesting. So if I pay for something in BTC, I don't have to pay taxes on my capital gains? If that's accurate, that would be a major tax loophole, but I'm not sure it is. Even if you make a lot of gains with another cryptos and trade it for BTC, at that point your gains are taxable (even though you don't convert to fiat). I can't imagine they'd miss taxing assets converted to services. Otherwise there'd be plenty of car dealerships accepting gold or company stock. But I'd love to learn more about this.
