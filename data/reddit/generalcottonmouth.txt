Nope. Crypto is mostly a hyped up shit bubble.  
You kids want to make real safe money?  
Now that you know how to open accounts and transfer money and trade - do it with real money in real companies that are crushing right now.  
Open a Fidelity account  
transfer money from you bank acct to Fidelity  
buy  - Tencent stock  
do it now  
do it every payday  
once you make the bank transfer you can buy immediately  
no bullshit. and you money will grow every day - for real

Scott, TD, Fidelity, Ameritrade, ETrade, Schwalb...whatever

My theory is that it's because young people are dumb, and are easily manipulated by big investors who stoked the media frenzy and started pumping the price up with buys, which then snowballed

your best bet is have your shit already on Binance  
wake up early, watch coinmarketcap.com for runners  
and play the MOMO for some gains and out  
  
not that i've done it, but it seems the only hope is to catch running trains for short rides
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:37:48
Because the sites are clogged to the point of disfunction 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:41:40
damn, that is some quick, cold logic right there
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:14:46
This did not happen. Oh, lucky him, and her bought at nothing, didn't sell at 100, then rode out lean times, didn't sell at 1000, then rode out lean times again, then didn't sell at 5000, or 10000, ...then BOOM, NAILED IT.

@_date: 2017-12-30 18:52:21
and get a 2nd job for those years in between - which could be a while, as this is going to leave a really bad taste for a really long time -  to keep those mortgage payments flowing
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:52:23
Well, it could lend credibility to the claim that BoA won't be allowing transactions for crypto with anyone but their own service.

You think you're being smart and sarcastic, but you're just foolish and stupid.  
Ironically you were correct though. The stock market is definitely not a bubble like crypto. 
Some stocks may be overbought, but only by a few multiples of their actual earnings.
Cryptocoins are all speculation with no earnings.   
  
What you're really hoping is that your hyped-up speculative gamble will turn into a world changing force such as Tencent. Why not jump on a real bandwagon that's already steamrolling for real?
 
How much money did whatever shitcoin you're hyped up on make last year?  
  
[Here's Tencent](  
  
Do yourself a favor and try what I told you. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:08:35
This.   
It's just a gigantic hype bubble for circlejerkers who think they're super nerds, but are really just dorks, spazzes, geeks, and dweebs.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:47:39
Yep. The reality that shit is going nowhere. It's entire value was retard mania of thinking this could be their only ticket out of whatever.   
This latest shit is again going to leave a bad taste in peoples' mouths for years. It may never rise again. 
But maybe in 5 or 10 years. Zombie Whales will devise another media campaign and scam a whole new generation.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:35:53
Well, now you can turn that 401k around...if you have one.
