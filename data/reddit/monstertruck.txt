How do I open a channel without running a node?  Is there a particular wallet I need to download?
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:37:53
Ah, ok ...  that would make more sense...  can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:13:18


That’s one of the questions I have about LN...  So please correct me if I’m wrong, still trying to fully understand the concept...  To open a channel is an onchain transaction for both parties, right?  Then either party can close the channel at any time, which would be another onchain transaction for both parties, right?  So if the counter party closes the channel, what determines what miners fees I pay?  Also, say I have 0.00000001 BTC in my channel and the counterparts closes...  I obviously don’t have enough BTC in my channel to cover fees...  what happens then?  Thanks!

Creating your own definition are you?  No, if it preserves the original Blockchain it is a fork.  A pre-mined coin is very different.

Lightning tokens are backed by Bitcoin in much the same way Fiat was backed by gold.  I think the argument is, the backing could be removed in much the same way gold backing was removed allowing an unlimited form of money printing and inflation.

Basically, folks have reneged on the NYA...  Now people are placing their bets on the other Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:10:10
So everyone on earth that chooses to transact with Bitcoin should run a node?  Sorry, not following
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:24:57
With all due respect, this is a global payment network we are talking about.  I don't think the intention was ever for Jo Schmo's laptop to run a node.  Nor does it matter...  Why would you even need Joe Schmo's laptop to run a node if the plan is to move to LN anyway?  I think running your own node on a RaspPi or home computer is a cool geeky thing to do, but I just don't think it's practical to expect the rest of the world to do this.  That's what SPV was designed for...  Letting users just be users.
I don't see large blocks as being centralized...  In fact, I see quite the opposite.  Once more and more merchants start accepting Bitcoin, companies with large transaction volumes will begin running their own nodes.  I can see 100,000's of nodes as it gained more adoption, which would be very decentralized.
This doesn't mean Joe Schmo can't run his own node if he really wants to...  Just mean's he'll have to invest in a nicer computer with a lot of disk space, like a gaming computer.  But regardless, whether he can afford to or not...  it's just not necessary.

Possibly, but this could be a strategic play by the miners.  They never wanted a capped blocksize with sidechain transactions.  That just shifts their mining revenue to 3rd parties on the LN.  People reneged on the NYA, so I think they might abandon the legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:07:31
So maybe it needs to be used more!?  It’s hard to say something’s spam if it’s accepted into the mempool by miners...
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:18:40
What fees did you pay?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:46:36
I think sidechains would bring in the regulators.  The way Bitcoin works now, is transactions are just picked up and recorded on a ledger for a fee.  Miners are not actually handling the money otherwise regulators would have already stepped in and done more than just declare Bitcoin a commodity.  With sidechains, oth, each member or hub helping to facilitate transactions actually handles the money for a very short period of time.  Being money handlers is what brings on regulation like KYC/AML requirements.
It is true that only larger companies will be able to afford a node, but that doesn’t mean just miners.  Many medium sized and most large sized companies that handle large transaction volumes will likely acquire a node to facilitate their own transactions.  Smaller companies will transact through merchant providers.  I can see the potential for 100,000+ nodes.
Yes some entities profit a good deal, but Bitcoin was always supposed to be a capitalist system full of competition.  Competition is what makes our world great!  I think it takes close to $21 million to control 1% of all the Bitcoin hashpower in order to secure the network.  That’s a serious investment, so it’s not like these companies are just printing money like the fed...  they are taking big risks and competing.
Each full node contains the entire history of the block chain right?  I don’t think it’s practical to expect all users to download the entire chain to transact.  With SPV, outlined in the white paper, users can just be users.  That makes the most sense to me!

I don’t think I’m comfortable storing my BTC in a LN wallet to collect tiny fees.  Sounds risky.  I prefer to keep it in a hardware wallet, so it’s really not solving the high fee issue for most of us since we would have to fund an LN wallet every time we wanted to use it.  Then pay gain to settle on the main chain.  So for me, onchain transaction fees need to come down substantially for it to be useable.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:58:51
Visa is centralized, 10+ companies is decentralized...  and the reality is there will be hundreds of thousands as it scales.  I’m sorry you are against capitalism.  Bitcoin was always designed as a capitalist system full of competition.
As far as blocks “big enough”, I think it’s painfully obvious there is no intention of ever increasing block size.  We’ve had opportunities, yet here we sit with a blocksize that can fit on a floppy disk.  The obvious reason is to remove user’s choice...  they’ll have no choice but to be forced over to LN.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:06:14
If you consider a fee below a certain amount spam, why not just drop those transactions before they enter the mempool?  Problem solved!
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:42:47
“there is no way the Bitcoin block chain can scale to encompass all the transactions it will need to support if it becomes the cryptocurrency of choice“...  why blindly make a statement like that without even testing it?  It is actually being tested with 1GB blocks and it looks like it will scale...  On the same note, why claim that LN can solve all problems without it actually being tested with high volume?  Don’t attack me too hard, just asking questions...
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:31:02


You seem to be projecting how you feel about Bitcoin onto everyone else...  I think that’s a little short-sited...  Some see it as a store of value and others get excited about it because of its potential as a global payment system.
I think that if it can be both, it should be both.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:06:29
That is not a problem with modern day technology, and it will only get better over time.  Over 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute.  Testing has already confirmed that 1GB blocks are possible.  There’s also a new technology called Graphene that is 10X More efficient than compact blocks.  17.5KB of data is encoded into 10KB with compact blocks and 2.6KB with Graphene.

“if you can't run a full node on a Raspberry Pi with a 1TB hard drive attached to it and a DSL internet connection, we have failed”...  Then you have failed.  I think Raspberry Pi’s were practical 3 years ago, but the intention was never to have everyone running full nodes once it started to gain adoption.
It doesn’t matter how small the block size is, Raspberry Pi’s will crash and the reason has nothing to do with block size.  It’s the mempool...  it has no limit.  So can Raspberry Pi’s,s handle a 1MB mempool, 2mb, 100mb, or how about 1GB?  I don’t know the answer, but I’m certain they will fail long before 1GB because they have already started failing over the past couple of days.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:57:50


Just curious...  Why would you say this?  I mean, with LN isn't the end goal to push all users to sidechains where they wouldn't run a node?
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:57:17


True, but really only the mining nodes can prevent the Bitcoin from being created since they are the ones that actually choose the transactions and create the blocks...  everyone else can only watch on...
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:49:49
Looks like it did exist.  It was created at least 8 years ago since the first comment on it was 8 years ago.
