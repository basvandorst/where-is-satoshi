Currencies are used by the governing power to levy taxes. Has been this way for more than 5000 years. What the power accepts as a payment for protection, services and taxes is what makes a currency valuable. I agree with you. Bitcoin, as a currency, cannot *not* be shut down by government. It just cant.

Live in central Quebec. 400km from borders. USD is accepted nearly everywhere except for big bills.

Yeah that's the main reason. As opposed to funding schools, border control, roads, bridges, military personnel, healthcare, police, etc. 
But wait... If I don't pay taxes, no one pays the police man, so it can't put me in prison...

Who would want to be paid in a "currency" that has, in the past, lost up to 20% of its value over a the span of a week. Honest question.

Man, and you're wondering why people think bitcoin users are delusional...?

We've way past full retard territory here.

Is it important... Why haven't I thought of that before. Of course! All of humanity's problems have been solved! It was as simple as that all along, a thing that's totally not as subjective as "what's important" should be the politicians first priority. Because we all know that what's important has always been there, in our hearts. Could you answer that question? What's important, @_date: 2018-05-31 00:50:16
Hey man, since you know the future you might as well invest in other things and become an omegalullionnaire.

Oh man I've got bad news for you. It's like we set up a very secure system for that but Bitcoins lovers and libertarians would have none of that! It rhymes with fat ranking system.

It's like the exploitation of those countries were beneficial to certain other democratic countries and their citizen in particular...  It's like a huge chunk of the democratics countries economy was based off the cheap labor in countries where the rule of law is non existent. It's like we all benefit from that exploitation... But no, I'm living in a well off country so of course, capitalism is working well for me eheh!

Nothing but what people will pay for it. Simple as that. It's a title whose value is based solely on the demand for it.

2018, the year some tech people wanted to get paid with a currency that acts as a highly volatile asset. What a time. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:41:37
For a currency to be just that it needs to be stable.
For a currency to be stable, it has to be trusted.
Itis a vicious cycle, thats why government backed currency will never be replaced by altcoins. 
People may not like to hear it, but no entity on earth has a predicted longevity thats close to that of western governments. Will Bitcoin retain its relative value in 100 years? No one knows, but probably not. Will the US still be a major power in 100 years? No one knows, but most probably. Its all a gamble, no one knows the future. But you can still make an educated guess. And no educated guess will point to cryptos being longterms investments...

Cant wait for bitcoin credit banks! Geez people can be naive sometime... For some here, it seems like it is a cure of all woes of humanity. It will crush inequality! And yet, most people here, including OP (lmao) are seeing it as a get rich quick scheme... Were a long way from anything with that kind of thinking.

He's taking dumb to the next level.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:47:27
Holding in large amounts is any currency system worst outcome. The fact that most Bitcoin users hold and don't actually use it will prevent it from having any widespread adoption. Holders are literally the cancer of Bitcoin as a currency.

Every single time, I can't help but feel bad for those "I trust mathematics" guys. Seriously. It's so sad. Mathematics don't have a mean, ethics or whatever. Mathematics have no will, they serve only as a tool to whatever you want. They don't back the currency more than they back the banking system. Some people here are so delusional it's incredible.

Can't believe someone actually believes that capitalism isn't responsible for the sacking of Africa's resources and the exploitation of its people by the West for centuries. Yeah, it just happened like that. Must be because they're black? And you call others ignorant? Can't make this shit up.

Youre like an artist. So finely threading between sarcasm, delusion and faith. Executed and written like the master poets of old.

A currency is desirable if it is accepted in exchange of service and goods.
A currency is accepted because a government has decided so.
The military and police apply the government's policy.
Is it so hard to understand?
If the US makes it illegal tomorrow to accept Bitcoins, what do you think will happen? The fierce internet nerds will succeed? All the business will choose to side with Bitcoin? No, because trading in US$ is still the most desirable way to trade goods on the planet.

It boggles the mind that people aren't even able to grasp that. And he calls others stupid.
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:10:56
Great explanation. The problem I think we face is that the majority of people just don't use Bitcoin as a currency. They just treat it like a stock. The fact that people here are partially oblivious to the importance of stability in a currency tells us a lot about the state of Bitcoin and the composition of its fandom. Most are here to make a buck, to invest, not to take part in the creation of a new currency.
@_date: 2019-09-03 00:20:23
At this point it's just sementics. Imagine being amazed because there are a limited number of whole bitcoins, but limitless fractions of a Bitcoin. Goes to show how the average user knows shit about it.
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:08:42
Because your legislators have given them that power? 
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:13:02
So you what you could buy with 1$ now you buy with 100$. Oooh shit. Why haven't the wages followed this trend? Oh wait... 
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:09:56
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:28:11
Why would I care? I won't use bitcoins until it actually is stable and usable. The fact the your are asking the question is telling about how you perceive the Bitcoin. The value of a Bitcoin is interesting to people holding it as a stock. The only thing that matters to people who see it as a currency is stability. Whether a Bitcoin is worth 100k or 100$ is meaningless as long as it doesn't shift 10% in value over a week, it'll be used. All value is perceived, including Fiat. The more stable a currency is, the more desirable it becomes. It isn't overly complicated to understand.

I'm on so, obviously I'm not surprised that there are some tinfoil people. But damn, not everything you read is true people.
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:08:37
Going as planned, considering the sole desire of everyone who actually buy bitcoins is to sell them at a higher price later to some idealist suckers.
