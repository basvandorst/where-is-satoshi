When Satoshi first settled on a fairly arbitrary target for block validation time, I have to imagine the "coffee purchase problem" seems obvious enough to all of us in retrospect that it probably occurred to him also. But not only did he go with it anyway, but it has endured anyway through lots of other developers working on the protocol.
I think that logically, the tradeoff for shorter blocks seems not to be worth worth massive decreases in relative security. There are other solutions for the problem.
Lightning network is one possibility, perhaps.
There are also other cryptocurrencies that have drastically shorter confirmation times that can be a good tool for smaller purchases, while not necessarily having to supplant bitcoin outright to hold a niche. The same way that copper, bronze and other materials less valuable than gold made more sense than cutting gold into ever tinier pieces, and having to worry about verifying the legitimacy of each piece every time; people just resorted to copper instead for smaller purchases but stuck to gold and other high-value metals when precision matters and time is available.
We can expect that double spend attacks should be pretty rare anyway for trivially small purchases since the reward is so low.

This, times a million.
It seriously blows my mind that anyone thinks such a scenario is really possible. Good luck convincing not just current bitcoin owners, but also all possible future bitcoin owners, against their economic self-interest, for some vague arguments that inflation is necessary. Even if it is right, good luck, it ain't gonna happen, buddy.

Who exactly do you think realistically stands to benefit financially from promoting an open source, decentralized exchange?
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:27:04
It may not be so bad actually. When hyperinflation events occur in a country, the part that generally makes it really hard is limited access to alternative stores of value and media of exchange, ie other currencies mostly. People can't get their hands on other currencies fast enough and in large enough quantities, and for various reasons they have to keep using the national currency despite its rapidly deteriorating value.
But you wouldn't be able to easily stop people from using bitcoin the same way you could try to ban dollars or euros from coming into a country. So even starting from zero, hopefully people will be able to trade their goods and services for bitcoin when the time comes without much fuss, and that will be that.

Mathematically, no one is going to bother to double spend petty transactions that make up the vast majority of consumer retail. The same way that most shops don't really have meaningful security measures, just basic deterrents, it's just not really worth it to try a double spend attack to get free shit. A small risk of getting caught, with even a very modest punishment, is enough to dissuade most people. The minor theft that will still happen is not a significant drain on profit.
If it become common enough to be an actual concern, then the law would decide that a double spend attack is sufficient proof that the buyer committed the theft, and then you bet your ass the thefts will be reported to the police. After that there is zero difference between double spend attacks and any other kind of petty theft. Yes, you can try it, but they have cameras or will just remember your face, and you'll be banned.

The whole uphill battle of waiting for adoption, but it's hard at first because few people use it so there's few places to spend it so few vendors have incentive to use it... it all becomes rather funny when you get that same realizarion you're talking about. It's so painfully obvious that some cryptocurrency will become the global standard. It's just always awkward in the early phase of transitioning between things like this.
There are way too many inefficiencies in place with the old banks. Meanwhile I can send digital gold in minutes with near absolute finality anywhere in the world, with all the risks implied by that. But over time, with higher adoption incentivizing better security and better front ends to users and savvier users understanding at least on a basic level some of the now more exotic features (good luck teaching your grandma to use multisig), the benefits so severely outweigh the disadvantages that it seems sort of impossible that we'd just stick to the old way instead.

Correct. Theoretically, you only need one copy of the blockchain to survive a total global loss. Once a minimal network is up and running again, everyone else can see that blockchain and validate it. Easy peasy, bitcoin is back up again.
Banking infrastructure has absolutely no redundancy built in like this. If information about your accounts are wiped, that shit is gone forever.
@_date: 2019-08-31 10:36:44
Absolutely. Really interesting to see how insane an impact cryptocurrency is having on.the world economy in just a decade, separate from the actual value of the coin itself but just in the sheer economics of mining. It's changing everything.
Who could have predicted that something so exotic would annoy gamers for years by crowding out the GPU market? Or suddenly become one of the largest energy uses around the world? That the most economic use at any given time for spare computing power could be trying hashes over and over again for arbitrary reward? But in fact that's our world today.
Anyone who isn't taking it seriously by now is beyond stupid. Even if bitcoin doesn't last, we proved a lot about PoW's economics in just a decade. There's no putting the genie back in the bottle.

I see this as a positive ultimately too. Exchange hacks are also, in the long run, good for cryptocurrency. Painful at the individual scale, for sellers who were already thriving with LBC, for those robbed on centralized exchanges, etc., but for the community as a whole it only strengthens immunity.

Sure, that's true, but the costs for solar have rapidly fallen over fifty years.
A recent record reached was $29/megawatt-hour for solar production. Hydro is at \~$20, typically. The trend is abundantly clear. Solar is going to catch up. It's improving much faster than other renewables.
@_date: 2019-08-31 08:37:17
No one said hydro and solar are necessarily mutually exclusive. It's just the scenario that was presented, so I was explaining that only analyzing it based on the single factor of electricity price does not give you the optimal solution necessarily.
@_date: 2019-08-29 11:33:10
Yes. And literally everyone, including those who run LBC, knows this. Same as when Shapeshift was mandated by government to plan KYC implementation. Everyone knew it was over.
The disgusting part here is that they don't just shut down so at least they could close up shop with dignity. Obviously the business will die, letting it happen in a drawn out way is a pure waste of money, and a disservice to the community.

Nor would the additional energy requirements for cooling in an absurdly hot, humid place like Georgia.
@_date: 2019-08-31 03:37:55
Obviously literally anyone understands that. My point is that in a place where the air outside is not warmer than the air inside, you don't want insulation. You ideally would want that cold air's temperature brought inside as much as possible, but still keeping your stuff safe and in good condition.

 Not the temperature itself, no. Electronics thrive at crazy low temperature. But frost can damage electronics so humidity may be an issue if the air is not on the drier end.

@_date: 2019-08-31 02:29:40
It's hot, and it's humid as hell, which means the vastly more energy-efficient technology of evaporation cooling is basically worthless in the Southeast.
If we still built according to more traditional architectural principles, we could better insulate houses and other structures against outside heat. 
But southerners love their shitty, tacky sprawl boxes, from which they drive their morbidly obese bodies around in shitty, tacky, oversized trucks, while paying thousands of dollars to heat and cool their shitty boxes they call a house.

@_date: 2019-08-31 02:23:38
That's a pretty big claim to make, but I don't have relevant experience on the sort of heat outputs we're talking about.
Still, just intuitively, air is air. If you had a data center in Antarctica, somehow perfectly shielded from dust/snow/etc but freely allowing the cold air in constantly and flowing through the building, you would never need a single joule for cooling.
Insulation is for the *humans* who might need to work in there sometimes, but in a cold environment during cold periods, it's not lowering your cooling costs, it's raising them.
@_date: 2019-08-31 00:59:08
The hydroelectric energy might be cheaper, but if you're in a warm and humid climate like Georgia, your cooling requirements for the building and fans and so on will be much higher. There is a significant tradeoff here, if solar is cheap enough and in a cool enough environment that you might save money overall even if price per kW-h is higher.

I'm completely in favor of changing our year count to something *genuinely* not tied to the Christian religion. Something like the bitcoin genesis block is a great example of what makes a good contender for a year zero mark, it should be something culturally pretty neutral, historically easy to pinpoint with exact precision, and should have some significance to most of humanity. I like setting day and year zero to the anniversary of the Trinity test to mark the start of the atomic era as another idea.
Just adding a completely arbitrary 8000 years to the same exact system we have right now is not shifting away from a Christian-centric calendar, it's just pretending to do it. It's as childish and stupid as the move to call it Common Era and Before Common Era instead of AD and BC.

It's not "trolling" to point out that this logic is retarded. You have lost value if you bought at a high price, period. It's true that you won't really realize that loss until you sell though, so that part is decent advice. But you absolutely have lost value, and there is zero guarantee that you didn't happen to buy at the last plateau. Presumably the price stabilizes somewhere, after all.
