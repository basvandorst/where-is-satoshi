Just install [Electrum](
Write down the 12 words it gives you, transfer coins in, and you're done.
There's virtually no risk of losing the coins in a computer failure or backup mistake, because all of your Bitcoin addresses can be regenerated with only the 12 words.
Even if the Electrum devs inexplicably disappear tomorrow, which is unlikely seeing as it's been around since 2011 and has many active developers today from all around the world, numerous Bitcoin wallets are compatible with Electrum's 12 word restore system. Many Bitcoin wallets are moving to this same system because it makes Bitcoin so much easier to manage.
In a worst case scenario, you can always export the private keys from Electrum into Bitcoin-QT and most other wallets capable of importing keys.
There's no need for USB sticks or Dropbox or CDs or Truecrypt. You can use all of those things, but there is no real reason to, since there are so many creative ways to keep 12 words secure.

The chances of finding a random 12 word seed are approximately 1 in 341,543,870,028,173,427,817,970,975,906,355,941,376, or 1 in 341 trillion-trillion-trillion. Or 2.9278815629673327e-39. Or `0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000029278815629673327`.

There are a total of 1,626 words in the electrum dictionary. Each word must be used zero or more times to form a 12-word seed.

Linux LiveCD with Electrum. Electrum generates a 12-word phrase from which all Bitcoin addresses are derived. Write down the 12 words on a piece of paper, transfer in your coins, and you're free to delete the wallet file. Shut down the LiveCD and everything is wiped. You could do the same on non-Linux OSes, but I wouldn't recommend it for a larger amount without 2FA or hardware wallets which are coming this year.

Asking people for money over the Internet isn't a new idea. A sales funnel for voluntary donations is still a sales funnel at the end of the day. Why are voluntary donations a nonstarter in your opinion?

Well, if it were easier and more compelling for users to donate to full node operators, Bitcoin would end up providing a larger incentive to run full nodes. From the feedback I've received, and I'm not saying I agree with it, it isn't important to provide this incentive to everyone. Server ops seem to be having fun providing the full node service. So I see the full node issue as something that could rather easily be optimized, but even then - I receive some backlash. I doubt if it's worth making a protocol level change.

If you want to take control over your money, you're going to have to compromise somewhere. Put Linux and your preferred Bitcoin wallet [on a USB stick]( and boot from that when needed.
I wouldn't want to trust a serious amount of money willy nilly to any OS. If you would, you are either very mistaken or have a very high tolerance for risk. That isn't going to stop me from trusting a couple hundred bucks to Windows, Mac, Android; possibly even more than that when 2FA native wallets and hardware wallets start to roll out this year.

You can use [physical]( [dice]( to generate the 12 word seed if you want to eliminate software dependencies entirely.
I assume you are referring to Electrum's degree of [decentralization](
You can start Electrum in offline mode, and generate all addresses in offline mode from the 12 words. You can export all private keys in offline mode as well.
During normal operation the client connects to eight public Electrum gateways, of the dozens of federated options, also [open source]( at random on startup.
Anyone can operate an Electrum gateway, which consists of a full Bitcoin node in addition to a full UTXO tree. You can operate one privately, or host it as a public/private Tor hidden service if you want.
This is the "thin client" model, where the wallet itself is the client and the client connects to gateways. The gateways interface with the Bitcoin full nodes.
While it should be possible to derive a list of public addresses from the 12 word seed, created from dice, on physical sheets of paper, I think the advanced mathematics would be a bit cumbersome.
You should be using some flavor of GNU/Linux for all Bitcoin dealings. This will matter less and less in time with 2FA and dedicated multisig-wallet mode around the corner. For the record I still wouldn't trust Windows for anything involving irreversible digital cash unless I absolutely had to.

A while back I [suggested]( Electrum randomly prompt users to donate to Electrum server operators, all of whom run full nodes. This would allow full node operators to profit from the service they are providing (full node + electrum server), but at the same time I understand many operators are doing it because that's what they want to do.
In any case, I think full node operators will need to earn BTC like any other service provider, by forming direct relationships with users and then asking for the payment.
One way you could facilitate this is as follows: after you send a payment with Electrum, you might be (20-50% of the time) prompted with a focused window containing a short joke or poem, or blurb, or link (e.g. [grnbrg's OT video fridays]( whatever adds value to your day, provided by an electrum server op. There would be a donate button that is easily avoided and the whole thing could be disabled from settings. It's IMHO a big improvement compared to having to track down donation addresses then manually create the transaction, and it requires no changes to Bitcoin whatsoever.

Agreed, it would be best to address this issue sooner rather than later. I think it can be addressed at the market level though, by wallets making a concerted effort to facilitate the recuperating of individual server op costs via voluntary donations. It might also be addressed at the protocol level, which would thoroughly root out the problem, at the cost of introducing side effects. Organic produce vs. chemotherapy.

I commissioned work for improving Electrum's UX, which included a potential Website redesign - these were the early prototypes:

as well as Android redesign, which may show up in future versions:
