But again, humans (and cameras, and mp3 encoders) don't output perfect Gaussian noise. They each have their own characteristics which affect the kind of noise that ends up in their output files! The presence of truly random noise in the LSBs would actually be a pretty telling sign that something suspicious is going on.
Your steg tool would have to be specifically crafted to adapt to the specifics of whatever tool you're using to create the files you're intending to hide the message in - further lowering the already limited room you have to encode that message.

Difficulty adjusts only [every 2016 blocks]( so roughly every 2 weeks.
It's playing catch-up with the hashrate right now.

The difference is I'm not talking about your mom, I'm talking about you.  
All I need to justify my claims are the words you wrote.
You don't find value in a linux distro, fine ; you don't find value in using a CLI, fine. But to arrogantly pretend that *everyone* who uses those has issues, or is somehow in denial, or has stockholm syndrome ? That's being a bigoted idiot, who tries to justify his own shortcomings by pretending really hard that everyone else is wrong.
Your loss, though. People who care more about doing things with the tools they have, or create new tools themselves, rather than sit there complaining about the tools they don't have, will be the ones actually accomplishing something in the end.

It's more likely than you think.

I use multiple OS for different things, including windows - so I don't, because I'm not as bigoted as you.

None this week, or this month, or this year. Or the few years before.
How is that arrogant, prejudiced stupidity doing it for you ?

I really don't follow your point.
Torrents became popular *precisely* because they made illegal sharing of copyrighted content more convenient.
@_date: 2014-12-21 10:32:36
This is such a great idea. I hope everyone starts using it.
BRB, making an ad that automatically charges you when you load it.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:15:04
Torrenting is legal.
@_date: 2014-12-21 18:39:33
Boy have I got a webpage for you.
It might take a while to load, but don't worry, you won't see any of the 10000 ads since you're paying for that.
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:49:49
It does, it's called "[send message](
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:50:15
Wasn't your point that something being illegal decreases its popularity ?
Why aren't legal torrents the most popular, then ?
@_date: 2014-12-21 10:22:36


Nice way to say that it is completely retarded.
Who would ever actually want to get automatically charged when a webpage loads ?

You mean, besides the [majority shares]( it [already has]( ?

If it's something that you're going to use daily for years on, might as well take some time to make it as comfy as possible.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:37:25
Yeah, I know. Just making sure people know that anyone can still get the original text even of things that were edited away.

Use [slop]( / [maim]( to avoid ugly selection borders randomly showing up in your screenshots!

You can never take things back out of Reddit. Be careful.
@_date: 2013-03-17 03:00:59
This is hilarious.

It can go as far down as we want it to.
