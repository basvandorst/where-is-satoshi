You will know that your account is activated, when the green button disappears, and you will be able to add your bank account information on the withdrawal page (Funding&gt; Withdraw&gt; USD).

We're sorry for the poor site performance during the heavy ETF reaction load today. We are working on upgrades to our infrastructure, such as a complete rebuild of our trade engine, server upgrades, and more. We can't give any exact ETA, but we expect to have some upgrades in place by late March or early April. Unfortunately upgrades like this are not trivial and take a lot of time to implement. So, we are listening to all the complaints about poor site performance and taking action to address it, but it will take some time yet before clients notice an improvement and we don't expect anyone to be satisfied until that improvement is a reality and not just a promise. If you need any further assistance, please start a support ticket at: 
You are welcome to let me know your ticket number, and I will have a client engagement specialist get back to you.

We apologize for the severe delays in our support responses. This is a very exciting time for crypto trading, and we are experiencing immense growth.

It's possible that your funds are tied in other open orders, so you may not be able to open new orders. Try closing your old orders. If you still need further assistance, it's best to consult with a client engagement specialist via our ticket system, so that a specialist can look at your account to identify your specific issue and resolve it.
