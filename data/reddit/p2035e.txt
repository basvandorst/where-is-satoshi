dude.. coinbase sucks.. this can't be the easiest way
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:35:55
It looks like some windows guys made this product.. i wouldn't use it.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:39:22
Just never use Coinbase

Who the fuck gave her the advice to use Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:32:22
Unbelievable. In worst case it might happen they refund your fiat and cancel the transaction. But you will get a very nice email, about how sorry they are for any inconvenience..
In the last few months my only recommendation for fiat-to-crypto use case has become Bitstamp (send FIAT, buy crypto and GTFO). I'm not the greatest fan, but at the moment they seem like the only reliable &amp; secure exchange, that can handle wires and cards I think.
EDIT: welcome to cryptoland!
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:35:35
Just get out of there, ASAP.. move your moneys to cold storage, take care of the security and HODL. When the day comes, the term "cash out" will have the opposite meaning and you will be on the right side!

yeah.. but you know. some people care about noobs
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:20:17
Yes, this I was asking myself, all along.! Damn this sucks. All this news on twitter and us being here in this subredit...this is getting totally ridiculous. It sucks to have all this foggy info when all this could be revealed by MK and everybody would fill better in a moment. Except the thieves, if they exist. which is still a big "???"
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:29:05
I think what they meant was this: If blockchain.info is under attack and you make a google or blockexplorer search of your address, somebody could be listening on the network and assume that this address is yours and it is part of the blockchain.info wallet. This could be a small advantage for the attacker.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:44:21
I don't think that's why bitcoin is about. Bitcoins are designed so that money is yours and only yours (as long as you own and control the keys, of course).
So even if coins are stolen, nobody can't take them from you..
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:35:51
this is just evil from them!
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:52:07

@_date: 2014-08-14 14:28:11
I'm sad cause I don't have any fiat to buy in, but this also reminds me on last summer when we had crashes to 40$ for no reason.. and what happened in later months is history.. :)
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:00:21
But it's the same BS... 1% of rich people runs the government and the police. And there's this 1% of evil psychopaths you describe, that still rape, tourture and kill other people. Some in the name of religion, others in the name of democracy. Or even just like that. Because they can. And because police will be 30 minutes late anyway.
So... I believe that in anarchistic society, these people would be removed sooner or later.
@_date: 2014-09-13 17:14:35
I actually don't own any doge :)
@_date: 2014-09-03 23:34:46
Wrong. There are two ways. Using the "Coinbase" field, or sending tiny amounts of BTC to some invalid addresses (that is basically some message with a "1" or "3" prepended).
There might be a third way, but not sure..
@_date: 2014-08-06 10:09:31

@_date: 2014-06-04 20:04:01
A very smart advice would be first 10$ to see how things work and don't go all in.. Go half in. This way you reduce risks by 50% and you still gain a lot when bitcoin gains in value.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:16:06
yeah i'm sure that everyone here don't just go and vote on youtube, but still a lot of downvotes on this video, that mostly just bitcoin people saw. The impact of this sub is getting quite serious!
expect us.. :)
@_date: 2014-09-15 05:40:36
True in the world of common sense but here you could be wrong. Look how many people are still defending them..
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:42:28
No. I just said that about murder charges explicitly!
I don't know where I saw that, but wouldn't that be a typical tactics of feds? To first accuse him of rape or murder and this way make it easier later in legal process. And also those charges were officially dropped right?

If I understand correctly, these trolls also hijacked this thread, op?
@_date: 2014-12-07 14:13:06
His point was that government should spend their resources more reasonably. Like fighting the real crime instead of this idiotic "war on drugs".
I've got my money stolen right from my bank account, by a bank! And I'm coming from well developed eu country.
If you haven't came to this conclusion until now, let me clear this to you: Banks suck, so stop trolling this sub with nonsense. Nobody here is that ignorant.
EDIT: And btw it's easier to store btc securely, than deal with a bank!

oh I upvoted this but I consider myself a troll too. but let's say i'm one of the good ones :)

@_date: 2014-07-12 12:14:14
Thanks. First, I don't have any creditors (except my parents) and I have no idea how am I making things more expensive for you.
All my life I'm being poor as shit and I'm not a lazy person!
If you want to know the numbers, I make around 250$ per month which is just not enough to cover my modest life. Just the apartment monthly rent costs me 200$. With the 50$ left I pay the telephone bill (25$) and my health insurance (20$) (which is kind of mandatory). Than I hate being hungry so I buy little food with whatever's left (that's usually btc).
And yes... I'm trying to find a better job, but there's NO JOBS HERE, so fuck you for saying that. What did I ever do to you!
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:20:26
oh.. and I've been around for quite some time btw

At some point I start to feel sorry about the guy. His face does not look tired, but he for sure looks frightened. I don't imagine to be in his skin right now...
but on the other hand: with all that money from the tx fees this was very bad manegement. you could simply hire programers and security experts and this would never had happened.
Damnit I don't know what to think of all this!
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:45:58
and you also.. wtf?!

They probably tracked the coins and found the connection between you and localbitcoins addresses. **Piece of cake.**

It doesn't work for me. I can't create an account. It says the password is not ok, but I entered one special char, one uppercase and numbers. How did they manage to fuck this up?
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:07:29
EXACTLY!! They are like this since allways! They allways bug you and cost you money in delaying and holding your funds in limbo. And they "have to" do this stuff whit a really sick fuck sick fucking approches! I mean I left them some time ago, but some of my (noob) friends had been verifying a few months which is painful, and some even did not verify yet! And after that you think you''re done, but fuck no.. Every now and than they come up with some new policy they'll have to comply, which is just more complications for you.
Run far away from BS*!
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:57:03
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:28:14
Oh. Your bank is quite nice.
I don't know.. for me it's easier. You generate the BIP encrypted wallet (offline), print o few copies, try if it works with a small amount, then send the rest. And your done. Money will stay there forever or until you move it and nobody can freeze your "account". And if somebody gets access to your paper wallet he still doesn't know the BIP password.. for me this is a mind blowing technology that cannot be compared to what they are having.
And I can do all this myself.. with banks you pay people to do your finances, you pay for the risk they are taking..etc. I've heard in Cyprus, they just took people's money to help themselfs. And these people never got anything back.
@_date: 2014-10-30 02:04:44
yeah they have this 1em padding.. you can disable with firebug.. :)

They are broadcasted instantly all over the world in a second. The confirmations are then taking about 10 minutes usually or more, but the receiver can spend the new coins instantly.

I just wouldn't be so sure.

use bitpay in any case.
@_date: 2014-12-07 13:42:33
They are having a shitty developers. The problem is purely in the fact that they manually process btc transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:29:44
hm.. first time anybody ever called me that, but whatever. if i'm conservative for being anti drug prohibition (because it's stupid, it's against freedom and actually creates junkies and drug cartels), than so be it.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:50:24
Yeah I think yeah changed that just recently. I could deposit, but not withdraw. Same for btc and fiat. Took me few weeks to verify, than immediately went the fuck out.. bitstamp is dead to me!
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:54:26
also true... you should be notified.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:49:59

@_date: 2014-09-15 05:32:29
This is just "ONE PROBLEM" for you!?! Are you sirious? Aren't you on reddit? Posts like this arrive once a week! This time they blocked a tor user, but they did some really stupid things lately. Like when a guy sent coins off coinbase, they bugged him for "primary use-case for his account", "source of funds" and shit like that! See here 
I've never used coinbase, but had a very similar experience with bitstamp. And I am no criminal if you wonder! I just like my own privacy and hate arrogant morons replying to support tickets. And I've already said this multiple times on reddit, twitter and who knows where else: "Coinbase and Bitstamp are two microsofts of the bitcoin world".
This will sound a little RMS but finally yes.. you shuld NOT use these, the same way you should NOT use a windows OS. We should all boycott these bastards who try to fuck with our human rights (be it privacy or the right to share stuff). Like you have "ZERO problems" with them, many people have ZERO problems on Windows OS. In fact many DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT ANYTHING ELSE EXISTS!
Oh and just spare me with the excuse that they need to comply with the law, because the law was written by people in power and not by us! Remember BITCOIN IS ALREADY REGULATED BY MATH, it doesn't need any law and no Lawski or Fincen can do anything to change this fact.

There are many guides out there but you should consider first if you even want to touch mining as it is very expensive investment these days.
The network is currently calculating 239 petahashes every second, which is ... A LOT (239,000,000 gigahashes). Bitcoin is the biggest super computer in the history of mankind. Just for the comparision, one ATI 5770 GPU calculates cca 150 megahashes, so you would get nothing with that.
a) If you want to play with GPUs, you can mine some altcoin. There are calculators that helps you determine what is the most profitable coin at the moment -  for example.
b) If you have money, buy asic harware
c) There are also these cloud mining websites, where you can borrow mining hardware for some time and use on the pool of your choice. My favorite is 
Oh and learn about pools. You probably won't be solo-mining.

It's only that all that wealth doesn't do any good and is controlled only by a person on the top... and these people need to be removed. I agree with OP.

I would say it will lead to less use of BTC.. not more.

Why is Coinbase so popular among US people? I tried the service when it started, didn't like it, withdrew, waited for 2 days for coins to move from Coinbase to my wallet and never tried it again.
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:33:41
yeah I'm sure they don't want to delete that
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:41:53
So there are few different points here:
1. SR was important as a free anonymous market
2. These murders are probably a complete fud
3. He must be lying or an idiot (for using his gmail, and for having all btc at one address)
I also think this imperialistic 'war on drugs' is stupid. Drugs win. Game over. It's just like any other authority. Using taxpayers money to fuck these same people. I have a few bucks stuck on paypal (have you guys noticed that paypal is useless these days?? i couldn't get that out!), so I may donate that just to help fight this stupidity..
In the end I'm a little sceptical about him, but I still want him to win the case. I hate those bureaucrats so much.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:56:08
maybe even better to watch this 101 series... this guy explains everything quite well

it sure is strange. looks like their api is up, but only trading is halted. which app are you using?

Fuck coinbase, fuck bitstamp! We can live without this kind of services. I'm non-US so Coinbase is not an option for me, but also I haven't used bitstamp for months (bad experience).
Localbitcoins is all I need.. :)

Everybody find a friend you trust, who has a credit card. Let's make a bunch of transactions and try out different memos..
- bitcoin
- NOT bitcoin
- btc
- hookers and coke
- terrorist attack
- child porn (maybe skip this one)
- (all ideas are from this thread)
We would give google some $$$ in fees, but it could make them think for a moment..

probably the best advice atm.. thanks

i am using firefox only
would donate btc if they had that option.
@_date: 2014-07-26 12:57:01
I agree. Anarchy could be the best society, because the bad actors are sooner or later removed by community. Also the bitcoin ecosystem doesn't need this shit. it's regulated by itself, by math and sceince.

Paypal is useless these days!

The balances in the db dump were correct to the last satoshi. That was confirmed by many goxed people. So the hackers must have had broke into Marks Gentoo servers and somehow get the latest db data. .. after gox was down. They also stated that they didn't steal any btc. Also on the blockchain it looked like no btc was stolen. There was no moving of 700.000 or 800.000 btc from gox to some non-gox address, right? It really looks like mtgox people just couldn't access the keys for some reason..
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:51:27
1000 times agree with you
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:35:55
lool. and you accept btc, i assume!
that's awesome. i also have a dealer who does, but he only has one btc customer.. :)

Well, bitstamp team is located in Kranj, but the mailbox is in UK, so i guess there must be a good reason for that. Could also be a lack of constructive communication with slovenian bureaucrats.

well, that for sure was funny. i upvoted him.

I like the point of letting him speak and later destroying him in the Q/A phase.

Another assumption based on just one guy.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:11:54
he just uses blockchain.info for watch only addresses. he has those private keys offline.

core doesn't come with the functionality to get txs by an address, and there's no such think as 'address balance'. except for watch-only addresses and in wallet mode your addresses.
in theory if you download the entire blockchain with "txindex=1" (which is not by default) and then scan all blocks and txs that ever happened then put every address you find to the Core's watch-only addresses... could you run a blockexplorer with that? would that even work?
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:02:00

There's Steemit, but many say it's basically a scam. Also there are a few ICOs that are trying to build something like that, but no product yet.

Interestingly many still use Windows, which is bad, but I wouldn't call photoshop guy a 'tech person'. And I have almost same opinion about .NET and MSSQL developers. They might be able to understand, but they are forced to use Windows and automatically they use it at home, never read the news and advancements from the other side.. Most of them never heard of bitcoin before late 2017.. So not real tech experts if you ask me.. If you are stuck somewhere as a .NET dev, you might be making a carrier suicide right now. Different story with gamers, they are tech, but most of them are too lazy for programming, and others are complete noobs in everything besides gaming. And it would be interesting to know what percentage of them that actually make money with gaming.

    sudo apt-get install **some program**
This is how you install something in ubuntu. It takes very little time and effort and  most importantly you can trust the server where the package comes from. Isn't that easier than browsing the internet and downloading a binary from a shady website and than run that on your machine?

So you're saying that there's something out there, that the army of reddit doesn't know about?
@_date: 2015-03-23 06:13:08
1. He fucked some people really bad, even before this GAW thing started smelling bad
2. He said that they are talking with major players like amazon, to adopt paycoin - pure lies
3. He said that they will keep paycoin above a certain price and failed
4. He changed his mind about talking at the conference as people were already freaking out that he might be running a ponzi
That was a few months ago... more than enough time to get the fuck out..
If you people didn't catch any of that on other platforms, that this definitely holds: reddit is the best social network of our time :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:19:25
damn.. so many false statements from this guy

This is true. I've just noticed 1BTC = 1257.85EUR exchange rate, when it should be around 1645 (kraken right now).

Yeah I think they were the first tv show that mentioned the word "bitcoin" back then.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:01:24
I have an impression that half of the comments were saying "don't keep coins in an online exchange".
Yes we get it, but let me explain to all those smart people that in case of BTER, that would be extremely difficult and not practical. I also keep some altcoins there, but thankfully small amounts. I cannot imagine having a darkcoin, nubits, nxt, shitcoin and all other wallets on my laptop.
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:01:52
with most altcoins that would still require me to download the full client
