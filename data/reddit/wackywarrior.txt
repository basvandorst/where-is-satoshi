Looking forward to the reactions when it goes back to 1 cent.

It's funny because even if it is fake, I have seen people talking about the loans they took out on their homes to buy bitcoin before.  When the market was on the up and up everyone here was saying how much a hero that person was.  How much they wished they had done what he had done.  Now, there is none of that in the comments.  Makes you think.  Losing money isn't all memes.

It's difficult to get people to buy in at these prices and get the returns you have gotten in the past.  If Bitcoin is at 10k and it goes up by 1k then it is just a 10% return.  If it goes down, it is likely to go down by way more than 1k.  There will never be the 10 times returns that there was.  
The code may be a solid store of wealth, but it is just printed money at the end of the day.  Every Tom Dick and Harry can print their own money now with less expense.  Their printed money does not use up the electricity of a small country either.

That bubble though.

I have been paying attention to bitcoin since it was worth $10.  You all are not looking at the big picture if you think all of your speculation about profiting off of bitcoin is actually increasing the value of it.  If it seems like it is too good to be true, it is.  I would suggest taking your gains and putting them somewhere safer.  You may miss out on the upswing, but you will sure as hell will miss the downswing.
