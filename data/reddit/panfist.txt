What's the point of moving funds to a segwit address? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:04:43
Not necessarily true, because segwit is also a fundamental change of the protocol, and incentive structures.
The double edged sword of entering this change as a soft fork is that some people will choose to opt out of using it.
I'm for it. I understand technically what it is but the ramifications are over my head. I accept that there may be a valid reason for people to opt out of using it, even though I don't see one.
I guess there's the "anyone can spend" problem but I don't think the risk is significant.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:03:10
How does it do that? A tx from your legacy address to your segwit address is just spam. Next time you were planning on moving funds, use segwit. Moving to segwit just because does... What exactly? Funds just sitting there don't stress the network.

No, a backwards-incompatible change is still a fork even if it gets 100% consensus and 100% adoption.

I think you don't understand some things that you think you understand.
The ethereum blockchain has higher tx and data throughput. That's why it can handle more data for less.
The monero blockchain has lower tx and data throughput. And due to its design, all transactions have a higher amount of data than the average eth transaction.
Therefore, monero fees are always going to be higher.
Also ethereum does not have the same privacy properties as monero. You can't just look at tx rate/fees, and say, "Ethereum more, ethereum better!"
Just no.

The attitude in this subreddit lately, holy shit.
Coinbase and bitpay are the companies providing the on-ramp. There is friction in the process of adopting bitcoin. They are reducing and eliminating it. They believe in bitcoin. If bitcoin "fulfills it promise" they are going be mega fucking rich. Generations of their children are going to be mega fucking rich.
But I suppose that would probably also piss off a certain segment of readers.
Yes, when bitcoin becomes a world reserve currency, they won't need to exist. But it won't become a world reserve currency without them.
What do you propose people do without coinbase? Localbitcoins? That (and mining lol) is literally the only peer to peer method to obtain bitcoins, and buying on localbitcoins is shady as fuck. Walk in to a bank, deposit money into a random account, and hope bitcoins show up sometimes... that's a brilliant user experience. Is that how Vanguard is supposed to obtain bitcoins to put into their retirement funds? lol

So many people accept how the current banking and financial systems work, without question. Or at least they understand that there are certain layers that they don't understand, but they are willing to accept that and have somewhat of an understanding of the applications built on top.
How can you possibly explain bitcoin to someone who doesn't understand hashing, public key crypto, or the three general's problem?
Fuck, my parents grew up in 1960s poland: a country depressed by the communist financial system. I tried to explain bitcoin to them in one sentence: it's like a bank account that can't be socialized. They gave me blank stares. I tried to bring up the recent banking crisis is Cyprus as an example, and they said, "But without socializing those funds, the government would have gone bankrupt."
My father kept bringing up the idea over and over that bitcoin software was written by one man, "So isn't he the central authority?" No.

Does having a WU sticker in the window of a convenience store count as an "agent location"?
In 2013, WU revenue from US sources was $1.5b, and $4b from international sources (according to their annual report). 
If we assume their international remittance fee to be equal to the global average of 8%, then that means they processed about $50b of international remittances. If the total global remittance in 2013 is similar to what the WB projected for this year, $436b, then that means WU processed about 11% of that total.
So 11% is dominant?
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:14:52
For someone who's criticizing pro-bitcoin ideology, you seem pretty ideological yourself. I mean, how else do you explain why you oppose it so strongly?
I don't think most people routinely hang out in forums about topics they don't believe, just so they can convince people their opinions are wrong...actually, wait, I guess that happens all the time, like between atheists and religious people on reddit.
So let me ask you, personally, why are you here trying to convince everyone bitcoin is bad? Why not just let bitcoiners be?
Anyway, I do think bitcoin has more uses than just to facilitate illegal transactions. What about international remittance? Transaction fees and processing time can be huge for those.
I also don't think you need to be a big tinfoil hat wearer to be concerned about privacy. The amount of privacy invasion (in my opinion) and data mining that occurs when corporations check your credit history, or eligility for health and/or life insurance is insane.
Anyway, I think of bitcoin as more of a decentralized "tcp/ip for money" than a currency in and of itself. Also I think two of your biggest criticisms--the volatility of bitcoin and the difficulty to acquire it--will decrease over time to the point where it becomes a non-issue. Hell, whatever currency you get your salary paid in, like dollars, is volatile too, you just don't notice because you're living in a dollar economy, but people involved in international commerce are definitely concerned with volatility of the dollar.

I haven't seen the video, and I don't know the following for fact, but...
I think WU doesn't have that large of a share of the *international* remittance market.
For some of the countries I know--Poland, India, Pakistan--I think the majority of remittances to those countries are processed by companies that deal specifically in that country.
So I looked up some numbers, and by my rough calculation WU has about an 11% market share of international remittance.

WU is not "dominant" in the US when it comes to sending foreign remittances. It's only dominant when it comes to US-to-US transfers.
I have no data to back this up, just guessing here based on personal anecdotal experience. I'm just trying to say that I would not automatically assume the international remittance market could not profit up to $175b/year. 


I'm not saying WU is not global, I'm just saying they're not dominant globally.
Using the numbers in that guardian article, "according to the World Bank, which projects that $436b will be sent overseas this year." and "The average transfer fee is more than 8%" which, roughly, means the global remittance market earns ~$35b gross.

Following the numbers in the guardian article I made this rough calculation:


So using your figure that "margins are about 5% gross" ... you're telling me that it costs the international remittance market ~$33b to do business for one year?
What kind of funny accounting is this? Is this like Hollywood accounting where they "pay" another company, which happens to have 80% board members in common with the first company?
I have a hard time believing their margin is only 5%. Where does that $33b end up, I wonder.

It seems like bitcoin would be perfect for this kind of charity, it just seems like markets aren't quite ready for it.

The "tech" of bitcoin is that it allows a decentralized network to create trust. That's the whole point of the blockchain.
If one entity controlled all the "equipment responsible for the transactions" then there's no need for bitcoin, hashing, proof of work, mining, blockchain etc. You just have... a ledger under central control. 


The difference is that coinbase is backed by bitcoin. Bitcoin is like "programmable money". Coinbase is just like a "bitcoin app". Anything is possible to be built on top of bitcoin. That's beacuse it's decentralized. Anyone can program bitcoin to do anything, and they can't be stopped. If JP Morgan backs a cryptocoin, if they don't like your app, they could just cut you off. If adoption ever took off, nothing could stop them suddenly deciding to take a cut of all your transactions. 


Anyone could do this...before bitcoin came out.

It all depends on your point of view.
"Fiat money is currency which derives its value from government regulation or law"
Maybe the laws that bitcoin is built on are mathematical. 
"Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree."
Government represents the people. Bitcoin has value by decree of the people. Bitcoin cuts out the middle man.
Maybe the word fiat needs to be re contextualized. I take it to mean the opposite of barter of goods with intrinsic value, the "ultimate" of which is gold.

I feel like any smart holder, in it for the long term, should have taken into account the inevitability of such a fork. 
In other words, the inevitability of a hard fork and the tumult that could follow is already factored into the current price. 
Put another way, the probability of hard fork seems to be increasing over time. And so is the value. So what makes you think actually forking would crash the price? 
Put another other way, after the dust settles after a hard fork, is the utility of bitcoin any less than it was before?

@_date: 2017-02-04 23:19:27
I'm not entirely sure if you know exactly how hard forks work... 
After a hard fork, everyone still owns all the coins they owned before, on both chains. You don't have to pick one.
If bitcoin forks and both chains continue to have nonzero market value, you can transact your coins on both chains, as long as you get both clients.
I think it's pretty likely that bitcoin could fork and both chains live. It depends on why the network forks. 
Let's say the network forks because a significant flaw is discovered. The flawed chain is unlikely to survive because it's objectively inferior to the forked chain. 
In the case of changing the block size? There are enough people on both sides of the argument that I don't see either side giving up.
There could be room in the world for bitcoin with 1mb blocks as settlement layer for lightning, and bitcoin with scaling block size. 
I don't even want a single cryptocurrency to "win". If a cryptocurrency wins, it essentially becomes a single point of failure in the economy.

I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when you say "it can't be done" are you saying that there's no way to decouple segwit from a scaling increase?
Then the idea that


makes no sense because you can't have one without the other.
But then it seems like you're saying that "hid[ing] the witness data from un-upgraded nodes" isn't inherently a scaling increase, you need the feature to "penalize non-witness data" to make it a scaling increase.
So you could remove the code that does the penalizing and this would effectively decouple segwit from the scaling improvement? Then leave in all the other "notable improvements" and let people signal for what they want.

What would they gain from controlling the hash power? If they started manipulating transactions, people would notice and the price would crash meaning all the money spent on hashing would be wasted. The network would fork to a different POW algorithm (assuming bitcoin doesn't completely crash and be replaced by a different crypto currency) and basically reset to CPU maybe gpu mining until new asics are designed and fabricated. 
Or they could just control people through military might which is how things have been done forever and will be after, whether bitcoin goes to the moon or not. 
The only groups big enough to manipulate bitcoin like this are either states who have militaries or groups who are fiat rich / powerful so why would they want to take a risk on something that probably doesn't pan out if you really think about it.
It's much more likely that bitcoin is disrupted to knock down new money that rode bitcoin to the moon than it would be in the way you describe.

If you have two ideologies on either side of a hard fork, you get a chain split. UASF is highly likely to cause a chain split because of this, imo. 


This is irrational and what I was referring to with the wishful thinking comments. Expecting them to come back when they are the ones who produce blocks is not realistic. If a majority of miners do not switch, because buyers of coins who pay miners don't share your ideology, it is UASF side which may be forced  to fork to lower difficulty.

I 100% agree that you should be diversified in things very different than crypto currencies, but within cryptos, you should also be diversified. In some ways crypto currencies are correlated, but some of those correlations are inverted. For example if a security flaw is found in bitcoin, or the scaling problem grows with no solution, then coins with different security models or scaling models will probably grow while bitcoin shrinks. 
In the same way that bitcoin hedges against the traditional financial system, other cryptos hedge against bitcoin.

But in order for the exchange to send them to you they have to validate the coins first. They're not going to send you coins from an invalid block.

Miners are nodes also. They do their own validation because they don't want to build on bad blocks. They wouldn't just trust what other nodes tell them. Not trusting the network is central to how bitcoin works.
Miners can't steal your coins because they don't have your private keys.

@_date: 2017-03-30 12:28:19


Can you see the future? No!
If a majority of hash power starts creating blocks that the non-mining nodes see as invalid, the mining nodes aren't in the "little network". The non-mining nodes are in the "little network".
It will come down entirely to whether or not people want to buy coins on the majority hashpower chain. If they do, miners will keep mining on it regardless of how many non-mining nodes reject those blocks. I could spin up thousands of non mining nodes in the cloud that reject those blocks but to what end? An infinite number of non-mining nodes could reject those blocks and the effect would be the same as if an infinite number relayed those blocks: nothing.
If people buy coins on this chain, miners in the minority will defect.
If people don't buy coins on this chain, miners in the majority will defect.
No miner wants to be in a situation where they are mining blocks that produce coins no one wants.
The decisions of non-mining nodes really don't factor into this. At all.

Kind of. It has downsides. I'll accept it but I'm not thrilled about it. It may be a soft fork but it's not without risk.

I'm not insisting on anything. I'm trying to call it like I see it. The world doesn't care what I insist. I'm on your side. I'm here trying to make sense of the situation. The latest crap about UASF doesn't make sense to me. It's garbage on the level of BU...I think. I'm trying to find out.


Yes. On that we absolutely agree. This happens in the form of miners producing a block and selling it at market price. In this case users are the set of all people buying bitcoins producing aggregate demand for the supply of coins. Buyers provide demand, miners provide supply.
So tell me where exactly full-nodes fit in this scenario? Certainly the set of full-node operators and the set of bitcoin buyers overlaps, but something tells me the set of bitcoin buyers is much larger and a good chunk of them do not operator full nodes or give a shit about full nodes. They just want to use the network, not operate it.
If all non-mining full nodes suddenly changed their validation rules and started rejecting previously valid blocks, are the buyers going to care? It depends on the ratio of hashpower trying to produce blocks that meet A or B set of validation rules.
If 100% of hashing power produces blocks that the non-mining nodes reject, the miners are just going to route around those nodes and continue producing invalid blocks. In this case it is buyers of bitcoin who decide the fate of the chain. If people keep buying, miners keep mining. If people stop buying, miners are going to stop mining that chain.
If 51% of hashing power produces blocks that the non-mining nodes reject, you end up with a cluster fuck.  But either way, miners are still going to build on the chain that produces coins that people actually want to buy. In this case, if all non-mining full nodes fail to validate blocks produced by 51% of the hashpower, the state of either chain is unstable and random. The mining nodes of either ruleset need only relay with each other and exchanges. Non-mining full nods in-between only make this more efficient. The absence of non-mining full-nodes in between cannot block a chain from growing.
If people want to buy coins on both chains, both chains will survive. If people want to buy coins only on one chain, that chain will survive.
Basically non-mining full nodes have a slight influence on the network if hash power is almost evenly divided AND there is demand for coins on both chains.

What fantasy world are you living in where "anyone" can buy 99pct hash power.
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:23:24


I mean the things you used to place a limit on the maximum increase seemed arbitrary.


So imagine the other scenario, where the blocksize doesn't increase fast enough and you need to fork again to speed it up. It comes back to, "this isn't going to be the fork to settle the debate forever".


What if you could find a way to factor this ratio into the block size directly?
Another thought is you really have to consider what happens after the 21 million limit is reached. Miners want to maximize fees. Fees only go up when block size is scarce. This is when users' interests and miners' interests diverge. For now miners get more value from bitcoin appreciation and block reward than fees, but that changes at some point. How do you balance these two forces?

"We" implying you're a miner?
There's a difference between selling for more than the electricity needed to run the miners and "selling at a profit". In fact there's a huge fucking difference. You have to sell the coins for *way more* than the energy it costs to mine them to make a profit.
As the price of bitcoin falls, the miners fall more and more behind on their "profits" but they are still selling for more than the cost of energy.
As the price continues to fall, some miners will start operating into the red, they will enter a point where they will never break even from their initial investment, but they continue to mine to soften their losses.
Maybe at this point some obsolete mining hardware is also taken offline because it's lower efficiency means it's not worth using any more. Hopefully it paid for itself already. This shouldn't make a huge difference because newer hardware is not only more efficient per watt but it's probably more hashes per watt and there's probably a lot more of it deployed, so as this obsolete hardware is taken offline in response to falling price, the change in global hashrate is not really that high.
I guess you're right: it is in this state of when the price is in freefall that there is a slight upward pressure from miners, because as old obsolete hardware is taken down, the time between blocks will increase *slightly* and the supply of bitcoins will tighten a bit.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:37:16
Running a non-mining node with different validation rules than miners is the bitcoin equivalent of walking into a gold mine and yelling at the workers.
The validation rules are going to follow the money. Whoever is mining on a chain where coins are selling, that's where all miners and all nodes will end up.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:19:20
I have absolutely no Idea, I just wonder why many people seem to think that botnets have grown disproportionately faster than all other computation making bitcoin far more vulnerable to attack than it ever was. I would say, computation and networking have increased pretty evenly and if it's on the people making the claim to provide the evidence that bitcoin is vulnerable to botnet attack if CPU mining returns. 
Personally I'm not in favor of changing the pow algo in the near future for the reasons people are discussing, except maybe to protect bitcoin core chain in event of hostile bu chain split, but if bitcoin is indeed vulnerable to botnet attack that is not really an option, is it?
Actually I'm pro bigger blocks, I wish smarter programmers would help bu instead of clinging to their own ideas when bu ideas seem to be gaining mind share. I wish we do not have a hostile chain split, but I also don't think that a chain split is the end of the world. 
In general, if anyone is going to pull numbers out of thin air to the illustrate a point... They should be willing to back them up, right?
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:57:18
I like that the discount ratio seems kind of arbitrary. I don't like that old nodes can't validate everything. I don't like that non segwit transactions will probably pay higher fees. 
These problems all seem kind of fundamental to me, meaning you can't really have segwit without them, but they are also related to why it works. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:17:35
Unless you're dealing directly with miners there is no possible way to buy coins without going through an exchange and you must trust them to validate the coins for you. Even if you run a full node it does nothing to help you in the moment you give your funds to the exchange.

I don't know what you mean by the average person loses money by the minute, except for the price crashing, which would mean the attackers are losing money too. The average person doesn't mine.
Yes bitcoin commerce would be disrupted for a while, but defensive hard forks are discussed enough that I am 100% positive multiples ones are prepared or at least outlined, and would probably be deployed within a day of manipulation being discovered. 
Yes the price will crash, who knows how long or how far, but the idea of decentralized crypto currency isn't going away. Anyone who performs such an attack if probably smart enough to realize bitcoin will recover or be replaced, so what's the point? You only have anything to fear if you're a massive holder. If that's true you should realize you're holding an extremely risky "investment". You should be diversified unto other coins because actually there are tons of reasons bitcoin could crash. 
The reality is that any attack on bitcoin results in destabilizing not. You cannot get wealthy by attacking bitcoin by controlling hashing power. Miners are barely scraping by and they have to sell most of their coins to pay their bills. A conspiracy to get wealthy by controlling hashing power is basically just...wait for it... Mining. 
The attack you're describing is basically just buying a ton of coins and then waiting ten years for them to be worth much more, right? Didn't you just describe all holders basically? 
There will always be big whales, basically very wealthy people who made a lucky bet on bitcoin early in its lifetime will stay wealthy, that's just how the world works.

I think facilitating trade of BU is actually the OPPOSITE of a "nail in the coffin" so to speak.

Honestly, I'm not qualified to comment. The more I think about this, the more I realize even so-called "experts" are making shit up as they go along so who am I to say anything?
That said, here's my totally unqualified opinion.
There are too many magic numbers here. It's going to be impossible to get something like this activated because of that.
Even if it were to be activated, the people maxing out would cry the blocksize isn't growing fast enough. The people voting min will cry it's growing too fast. It won't be the one blocksize fork to end all future blocksize forks.
Even your numbers that you think are derived from something important, how do you know that the metrics you picked are significant?
80% per year seems way too high. In seven years blocks could be over 100MB. I would not take it for granted that everything in the world will keep scaling according to these so called "laws".
Did you ever project how long it would take to validate a 100MB block in 7 years?
It could work. I think inaction could hurt worse than doing something that isn't optimal. But I don't think something like this could fly because there are too many nits in it to pick.
I just had a crazy thought while I was considering your proposal.
Do you remember when asic miners were first offered for sale to the public? It revealed something that should have been fairly obvious to anyone with half a brain: if you could make a machine that prints money, why would sell it?
Use this event as a lens, and look at the blocksize debate through it. Or maybe more generally, hardfork research.
If you discovered some significant cryptocurrency innovation like the solution to blocksize or the solutoin to hard forks, what would you do with it? Give it away? Or would you sit on it while you figured out how to deploy it in such a way to maximize your personal gain? Maybe at the very least you buy a few more bitcoins or give your closest friends and insider tip, because tomorrow you're going to post the hottest bip ever and you know the price is going up. Maybe your idea can easily be deployed in bitcoin. Or maybe not. So you figure out how to deploy it in some other new or pre-existing coin, and you short bitcoin. 
I have no idea how it could play out. It would depend on a lot of things. Who discovered this, and what's their agenda? Are they trying to disrupt bitcoin or are they trying to use bitcoin to disrupt the established power or are they trying to bring financial services to the unbanked or are they a state or are they anarchists or are they terrorists? How suited is bitcoin to be upgraded with this particular idea?

People aren't going to want to transact in bitcoin if there aren't 2nd layer systems that manage risk for them. I don't mean 2nd layer as strictly side chains or lightning. It could be anything. A business is not going to start integrating bitcoin into their flows if they can't manage risk. Maybe that means insurance markets are going to grow and evolve with bitcoin. Maybe it means businesses will transact in 2nd layer systems with chargebacks. Who knows. But businesses aren't jumping in given the current parameters of the system.

The point of bitcoin is you don't have to trust the miners because everyone acts in their own selfish self interest. 
Well if mining were decentralized, it might take extremely long time to confirm since a block is found once every ten minutes on average across all miner, and you only trust 20% of miners. 
What if we don't share any trusted processors, I guess we just don't do business then?

It does have friction, but the friction does not scale up as transaction size goes up, like it does with gold or cash. The friction is constant or kind of goes down as clients get better and we figure out how to use bitcoin easier.

@_date: 2016-11-10 09:27:28
The amount of bitcoin has a maximum, but not the value, because value is a social construct.

The reality is that even if you have 100% consensus at the time of the fork, you might not have it forever. Couldn't a minority go back to mining the old chain? Or fork the code back at any point in time?
A hard fork certainly increases the risk of volatility. But I would wager that after the shock waves pass, the market cap of both chains is flat or increased compared to before the fork.

The reputation of bitcoin is that every time a tiny change goes through, the community gets their collective panties in a twist and then nothing happens.
The amount of infrastructure in bitcoin is a liability as much as it as an asset, because the infrastructure is provided by one or two companies, which are basically now the single point of failure in the whole house of cards.
Accumulated proof of work, big whoop. I really only care about the last 6 blocks of POW. If I can't trust something that's been confirmed six times, then what's the point of the whole thing?

True 4G is just better networking technology. If you're doing anything that's sensitive to latency or dropped packets like VOIP, I think 4G would be better.
Unfortunately 3G, 4G, the numbers don't matter because carriers describe anything that's newer than 3G as 4G even if it's more like 3.1G.
Also there are a lot more factors at play. Depending on where you are, how close to tower, geography, etc, 3G at 700MHz might be better than 4G at 2.4GHz.

Coming from someone who used to oppose segwit, I think this is actually pertinent. 
At first my main reasons for opposing segwit were it seemed overly complicated when a simple block size increase would do. There were also people repeating various vaguely technical arguments against segwit that sounded reasonable. The worst thing was that the censorship scared me. 
I think censorship was a huge mistake because it turned a lot of people off to the idea of segwit for no good reason. 
Anyway, the more I read, the more I found that 99% of people repeating technical arguments against segwit actually have no idea what they're talking about. 
There are some valid technical arguments against segwit, but I believe that any change to a sufficiently complicated system had pros and cons. It is very hard to make a change with literally no tradeoffs. In this case I think the tradeoffs are good ones. 
So, back to the point of how this is pertinent. I think there are very few prominent prod opposed to segwit who don't have an obvious conflict of interest like Ver or Wu. For example exchanges make money on volatility and volume so if there is a chain split that could be good for them, so I would take their opinions with a grain of salt. 
It seems like far, far more players in the bitcoin ecosystem support or are neutral on segwit, whereas most people against it have an obvious conflict of interest. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:32:29
Are you sure about that, if you really think about it?
The next block is always 10 mins away on average, whether an empty block was found or not (ok there's a slight fudge factor for propagation and validation time).
They increase the block height so previous blocks have more confirmations.
What else is a miner supposed to do while waiting for block validation?
Unless block propagation and validation time is literally zero, empty blocks are inevitable.

I don't think mining empty blocks is a problem. You can read tons about how these are inevitable and they still add security to blocks below them. System working as intended. 
I don't think resisting segwit is a problem either. Personally I am pro but I respect people who are against if it's in their interest to be against it. From a miner point of view, segwit means less on chain scaling means less fees in a few years when the block reward goes down. Miners want a piece of lightning and it has the potential to totally kill their fee market when everything happens off chain. System working as intended. 
The above two things are basically not related to asicboot. The second one could be linked but if asicboost did not exist it would still be true. 
I really doubt Greg would say that he found evidence of the exploit in the hardware, if he didn't actually. But he did not even mention evidence of it being used. And a lot of people assume it was.

Why are they a burden? They are not without benefit in the way they confirm previous blocks. They do not take a lot of bandwidth or a long time to propagate and validate.
The healthiest thing is for there to be competition among miners, to be the most efficient, and that means those miners that are more efficient are going to find more blocks, empty or not.
I think a miner would rather find a block *and* have it be full of fee paying transactions, but like I said, what do you want them to do during block validation...twiddle their thumbs?
They do not increase the average time to find a full block.
The miners are simply acting in their self interest according to the rules of the system. The miners are healthy. The system is not.

If you were in a charge of megacorp that produces the best bitcoin miners on the planet, why would share them with anyone else?
Of course designing and building a bitcoin miner requires some amount of capital expenditure that you would like to re-coup, once you re-coup that, everything after is just gravy.
You can sell them at such a high price that people will barely break even, and people will still buy them, because fuck you, that's why. But maybe the price of bitcoin is good enough and the miner is good enough that you don't even have to sell them; you just make them, turn them on, and start mining, and use the profits to make more.
Why is anyone going to even bother trying to compete with megacorp when they hire the best hardware engineers out of college and they can apply economies of scale from all the other chips they already manufacture?
That's great for decentralization.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:56:41
They sell them because they need capital. If an established mega corp ever got in the game... They have capital.
Normally when a company produces something they want to sell it asap because inventory costs money to hold. Bitcoin miners change that equation.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:15:38
Is this on the forums or mailing lists?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:52:50
To your first point, that's why I made the comment about once costs are re-couped everything is gravy.
To say the cost of a miner is a fixed price is hiding so many accounting details. The unit cost to manufacture includes the R&amp;D cost, and then if they own the chip fabrication and assembly facilities accounting gets even more complicated because they're not writing out a fixed contract, they are the ones paying the cost to set up the lab and paying the opportunity cost of what else they could have made instead of miners.
To the second point of running the machines: they already have massive data centers. If they want to shield themselves from price fluctuations they can set up a shell company that operates in china or wherever electricity is cheap, sell the miners to them, and then either absorb the profits or cut the losses.
These lessons go all the way back to the very first ASIC miners, buttefly labs, etc.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:57:10
If Megacorp2 made them, why wouldn't they just turn them and mine with them, instead of selling?
It only makes sense to sell the miners if they make more from the sale than mining--which means the buyer basically has zero chance to get a positive return on investment.

You know what's toxic? This community. It's a hive of shills and trolls and other people who mean well but are just plain ignorant. People are very quick to be rude to each other, speak in absolutes, and be very dismissive of anything that doesn't immediately confirm their world view.
Whether or not asicboost is bad, I'm not arguing either position. I'm just trying to get you to empathize their point of view. They are not the enemy.
Personally, I do think it is bad, I just don't think slinging around words like "toxic" or "attack" is a good idea. 
From a very high level, a the role of a miner is to exploit the blockchain. Mining just happens to be the easiest, most obvious way to do that. These are very smart people who saw potential in cryptocurrencies. They could be doing anything else, but they chose to mine bitcoin. 
Think of asicboost as a bug bounty. When someone discovers a problem like this, you don't call them toxic and attack them back.
Miners aren't fucking boy scouts. They are cut throat. Billions if not trillions of dollars are at stake. If bitcoin actually becomes a worldwide currency, someone who's in on the ground level could literally hold a double digit percentage stake of *all the wealth in the entire world*. 
We want those cut throat miners mining bitcoin, not another coin.
Please don't sling words like toxic unless you really mean it. If Andreas is saying it, well he does like to be a little hyperbolic.


I don't know where you're getting your math but it doesn't sound right. I would love to see Andreas doing these calculations. I did not think the economic impact of asicboost was presently that high, unless you're factoring in potential future earnings.

@_date: 2017-05-17 22:50:27
You said this:


You're assuming that basically 90% of the total cost to mine bitcoin is electricity. You say, "assume for the sake of explanation" but then you never revisit the truth of this statement.
So let's take a look. Here's a price comparison of current miners: 
The "best" miner, assuming they are all equally efficient in terms of hash per second per watt, is the one with the most hash per second per dollar. They are actually not equally efficient--the more efficient ones are more expensive per dollar. We'll revisit this later.
The miner with the most hash per second per dollar is SP20 jackson at 0.01444-0.01889 TH/s/$. Let's take the midpoint of that: 0.016665
Let's say you are an ambitious miner and you buy 1000 units of this miner at $90 each, total $90,000. 
Your hash rate is 16.665 TH/s.
Let's plug that into this bitcoin mining calculator: 
According to the calculator this will earn you $411 per month.
At this rate it will take you 218 months to earn back your investment, *assuming electricity is free*. Which of course it is not, which means it will take even longer. At this point it is safe to assume that if you have to wait 218 months, this investment is never going to pay off and buying these miners is a terrible idea.
Let's say you can buy these miners wholesale and you have a 90% discount. They cost you $9 each instead of $90. Your investment is $9000.
At this rate it will take you 21 months to return your investment. Again assuming electricity is free. And assuming the difficulty doesn't increase in that time, which it will. When you factor in electricity it takes even longer. 
So back to your statement, 


I hope I have demonstrated that the idea that 9 out of 9.9 million in cost is electricity is unrealistic. The cost of electricity is actually a tiny fraction of the cost of mining compared to the miners themselves. I have tried to show that even if you pay $9/TH/s, the great majority of the cost of mining is buying the hardware.
Please let me know if I did my math wrong or had any wrong assumptions.
You might say, Jihan sells the hardware so it's not a cost, but that isn't entirely true. He gets it a deep discount, but it still costs a lot to actually fabricate the hardware, which he does not do. It costs a lot to design. An electrical engineer who has the talent to design a modern ASIC miner could get a job paying $250k per year or more working for a hardware company. They are basically designing these things for free hoping that if they hodl a tiny fraction of bitcoin after paying back their costs, it will increase in value in the future. In other words...they want the price to go up.

It's not a diversion, it's an analogy. The first asic put more efficient hash power in the hands of the developers. Was that bad? If you think it was not, then what do you have against asic boost? The situation is very similar.

I'm not trying to assess validity or quality of arguments. Just stating what they are.
Look at your argument. There is no proposed off chain scaling solution that isn't centralized, so, how exactly is 2nd layer now superior to, say, double block size now? 
If 1mb was sufficiently low to be decentralized in 2010, surely double in 7 years should be ok? Given Moore's law and the law about networking, whatever it's called. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:31:29
I asked you to link me to Andreas' math and you linked me to yours instead. 
You directly state in your post that 20% decreased electricity costs lead to 20% increase profits. Which I'm saying is false, because that implies the cost to mine is exclusively electricity. It's not. Your math is based on what I would say is not a true premise. If you want I can explain more. 
I did not mean to accuse you of being brainwashed. I meant people on this sub van behave that way. I am seriously not trolling and did not mean to come off that way. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:55:27
Simplest explanation is, all other things equal, miners prefer on chain scaling because they get a piece of every fee. If transactions happen off chain they don't get a piece of those fees.
I said "all other things equal" because maybe if bitcoin evolves in a direction of off chain scaling, miners could actually collect larger fees on chain. But who knows.
There doesn't need to be a grand conspiracy to explain this. It's just miners doing exactly what they should according to the incentives in place.

These "canaries" are utterly owned by three letter agencies. Every single thing done on there is tracked. Every request, every post, every browser fingerprint, everything. Sort of like a honeypot. If that sub ever gets shut down there's a chance it would drive traffic farther into the darknet where it's harder to track.
These "canaries" could be shutdown by reddit or three letter agencies, if it serves their interests, for example if it attracts too much attention from mainstream media to whip up a certain population, or a scapegoat is needed for whatever.
If anything, I assume that three letter agencies encourage reddit to keep these subs up, as it would probably be better for reddit's image as a mainstream site (and therefore as a money making machine) to shut them down. Imagine a ten year old kid looking up minecraft subreddits or jonas brothers or whatever the fuck else it is kids are into these days, and his parents block or discourage that because they heard about jailbait or darknetmarkets on reddit. Reddit's mainstream appeal is FAR more important to investors than whether or not they offend tiny populations in the dank corners of the internet.

I am very confused. Please explain. What does your 20% number mean. It sounds like you're saying it is a lower bound on increased profit. If not this then what are you trying it say? It's neither upper nor lower bound? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:44:59
Well value is all relative, right? 
You are doubling the coins, in the sense that either chain still has the same 21 million coin limit. Coins mined before the fork have a common transaction history and coins mined after do not. So you don't have to worry about previous tx being replayed because receipt of all those tx is before the fork. 
But the value of spending coins on either chain is something that only the market will decide. 
If you are buying something and offering bitcoins, which ones? What if the seller doesn't take one or the other? Or if they prefer one or the other according to some ratio? 
There are people who proclaim they will immediately trade all of their coins on one fork for coins on the other. They are ideologues, gamblers, and speculators. Maybe they are not being honest. 
I heard of markets forming where people are actually posting trades between the forks. In other words, legally binding contracts to trade x coins on one fork for y coins on the other. 
The gamble is essentially this: at the extreme end, they think one or the other chain will die, and want to lock in a favorable exchange before that happens. So they say, "I promise to trade 10 bitcoin x for 1 bitcoin y at the fork." Because they think farther in the future bitcoin y will be worth more than 10x bitcoin y. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:37:40
It may be correlated to the rate of change of the price, because when it moves rapidly, tx volume tends to go up, therefore the mem pool might fill up, etc.

Of course it's clear. It's just not much different than any change to pow. Of course pow is not completely decoupled from protocol. Authors of code are only human and they screwed up by leaving this accidental coupling here. It's not the miners' fault they are exploiting it. 
Miners gonna mine. By any means. They are going to lie cheat and steal to mine. To expect anything different is naive.

The reason people are saying you're misunderstanding him, is that he fully understands everything you wrote. You're just being pedantic about the legal definition of ownership.
In fact, it makes it seem like *you* don't understand how bitcoin works, because if funds are sent, the original private keys that are owned by the sender lose control of those coins. They are sent somewhere by doing a bitcoin transfer to an address published by the recipient. The recipient holds those private keys. The sender does not.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:03:06
But the idea that 20% decreased electricity could make them profitable is just pure speculation then. 
The idea that 20% reduces electricity could take you from negative to positive profitability is true, but the connection to bitcoin price and assertion that this is more profitable than increasing price is based purely on your hypothetical numbers, which I have tried to demonstrate are unrealistic.

If both chains have value, you're not going to just "follow" one, right? Or are you saying you just intend to dump coins on one ASAP and buy on the other? I highly doubt anyone except exchanges are going to make anything in that case.

No, not new, just not brainwashed. I don't believe everything because it confirms my desired world view. 
You mentioned Andreas did these calculations. He didn't. Why would you lie, if your argument is actually sound? 
I checked your math. You assumed a 20% reduction in cost of electricity is equal to a 20% increase in profit. From the beginning, your logic is flawed. A big proportion of a bitcoin miners cost is capital investment to buy mining hardware. When they first buy it, they are in debt. Mining bitcoin allows them to crawl out of debt a d hopefully near the end of the life of mining hardware they can start to turn a profit. Cost of electricity is only part of operating costs, maybe the great majority, but that's just operating expenditure. If you count capital expenditures as well, electricity is a much, much smaller proportion of total cost (cap-ex plus op-ex). 
Also the block reward, coming on average every ten minutes, equals about 4400 rewards per month * $1800 = $7.8 million total reward to all miners. But that's besides the point. 
Your analysis of market forces is pretty simplistic. You forget that the miner behind asic boost also sells miners. So if bitcoin soars, he will make a butt fuck load of money selling miners at a premium.
I'm not surprised none of the top comments called you out on your reasoning about profits,  because like I said, this community (not limited to is toxic. Every person, technical or not, feels entitled to not only share but shout their opinions based on half truths.

You fall under scenario number 1. You control the private keys to your coins. If/when any fork of any kind happens, including this one, you automatically can spend coins on either chain. 
In other words, you own coins on the current one and only blockchain. After the fork, you still own the same coins, but now there are two places you can spend them. 
The reason people say to hold until the situation stabilizes is kind of complicated. One thing you'll need to watch out for is transaction replay.  
The short version is that unless one side of the fork or both implements replay protection, if you send coins to someone, your transaction can be replayed on the other chain. Maybe the recipient will be paid twice. Maybe the replay destroys the coins. Maybe the transaction is invalid on the other chain. It depends on the technical specifics of the fork and the transaction.

Do I have the wrong idea of your post? Here's what you said:


If I have the wrong idea of your post, then please help me see what you're trying to say.
I'm saying that electricity cost is actually only a small fraction of total expense to mine bitcoin. The total expense to mine bitcoin is capital expenditure (buying miners, buying racks and network hardware to connect them) and operating expenditure (electricity, network connectivity, leasing space to hold all this, paying employees if you have them). Electricity is only one component of this. In fact some people get electricity *for free* and still fail to turn a profit.
If I'm wrong, please tell me what part of my argument is wrong. If I'm wrong, can you please help me see why I'm wrong? I love being wrong It means I learn something.

The reason the original activation threshold was so high was to avoid chain split.

Isn't rejecting non segwit blocks also a change in consensus rules? What does a 2% swing in hash power really make one chain an alt and one not?
There's no room for ideology on bitcoin. UASF is going to force a chain split. Like others said, economics is going to determine the outcome. Who is going to pay miners to mint new coins on which chain? The money doesn't care who is alt and who is not. Maybe one chain will die and it will have been the alt. Or maybe neither chain will die and they're both alts from different points of view, but "alt" is just a name. Or maybe they'll both die.

You are assuming all the miners agree on the rules and mine with the second software. They don't. If all it takes is 50% mining power, that's why the activation threshold would have been in the first place. But it's not, it was 95%. 
In the same way that UASF is a rejection of non segwit blocks, they too can choose to reject segwit blocks. 
If 49% of miners disagree with segwit on Aug 1st, they are not just going to change their minds because a calendar date changes. This is your delusion. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:27:37


LOL, I think if they would have capitulated, they would have by now. Bip 148 is basically "segwit at all costs". The other group is "never segwit at all costs". What makes you think they have any intention of capitulating, ever? The only way they capitulate is if the value of coins on their chain goes too low to support mining, and even then, they ate likely to fork to reduce difficulty than just give up. 
There are people as strongly opposed to segwit as there are people in favor of bip 148.

Think of bitcoin as tcp/ip for money. You don't need to be able to exchange bitcoins for goods, because you could theoretically hold bitcoins, and in one transactions, exchange them for fiat that you give to the merchant, who could theoretically keep the fiat or exchange it back to bitcoin, and it would be pretty hard to trace.
The value of btc will go down if it moves into a legal gray area, but there are enough people doing legally gray things like sheltering assets or buying drugs or whatever that it will still hold value, and not crash completely.

The only one of those that I agree with is that it's hard to prove its authenticity. But you're right, that pretty much makes it a deal breaker.
edit: 
Gold is hard to divide? No. You can dilute gold in alloys. But then it makes it harder to authenticate. 
Hard to transport? Not really, unless you're moving huge sums of wealth. There are approximately 28 hundred dollar bills in an ounce, price of gold is $1300/ounce...yeah you can move twice as much fiat as gold per ounce at the current market rates, but they're on the same order of magnitude. Any more than one ounce at a time I don't think disqualifies it for use as a currency. For large transfers of wealth, you would never do a physical transfer anyway, it would be bank to bank, and it's not your problem. The point in the video is that you can't use it as a daily medium for exchange, the weight of gold isn't really relevant to that problem.
Hard to keep safe? Not any harder than any other physical, tangible good. The only thing that makes it hard to keep safe is that you don't know that it hasn't been swapped with a counterfeit when it's out of your site, which goes back to being hard to authenticate.

I'm sorry, I couldn't make it passed 1:30 in the video. 
First of all, I'm pretty sure that bankers existed and thrived before fiat currency. And I'm pretty sure they'll exist and thrive in a world of cryptocurrency as well.
Second, I think the only thing stopping gold and silver from being a competing currency is that it's forbidden to use them under US law. That's the only reason they aren't currency.
So unless I'm totally wrong, the video is 0/2 on the details. Then it gets to the part where it plays out of context news clips...the over dramatic style is what killed it for me.
I decided I should give the video another shot...1:30 isn't that far into it. I think the technical explanation could use a little editing. Every thing after "increased at a steady rate" are valuable details, but they're just kind of mashed together out of context. I doubt anyone who is new to the concept of bitcoin would remember any of it. The details about bitcoins coming in blocks, with 25 per block, one block per ten minutes...it's just noise.
The video gets much, much better after that.
I think this video would be good for someone who already knows a little about bitcoin, but the intro needs work.
