Can I please get the sauce?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:02:19
That's cool and all.  But I'm not willing to pay $10 for someone else to cut my hair, $40 is insane.

Watching this doc on Netflix now.

OP, we are waiting for an explanation.

Kept refreshing at $9000 to buy, no luck.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:03:40
No fuck you.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:34:19
Is this an anomaly?

I had to find the video this is from, it's too funny.  Skip to :25 for gif.

Your memory will definitely improve, it will take longer than a couple weeks though.

If my grandmother had wheels she'd be a bike.

I don't have anywhere near that amount of BTC but why would sending a large amount of BTC to coinbase be a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:48:15
All kinds of manipulation happening here, unsubbed from r/science when I saw all the removed comments.

Okay thanks.  But do I need Bitcoin-Qt to purchase BTC?  Or will the website just take money straight out of my account and say I have .XXX BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:45:13
Does it work with chase?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:22:13
I'm at 95% with the Bitcoin-QT download.  You've been very helpful, thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:59:40
It needs proof of ID as well.  I'll just have to wait.  But just to get things clear, after providing proof via photo ID and document  I just punch in the amount of BTC I want to buy and it should work right?  No other steps?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:20:49
That's what it said but I tried depositing and the total ended up adding a 20% fee.

I'm trying to finish setting up OkPay to use Mt. Gox.  But thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:12:08
That makes sense.  One more question, if I have 1 BTC in my offline wallet, will the exchange that I bought it from also show I have 1 BTC?  or can BTCs be stored in multiple places?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:45:32
Thanks, but I have Chase.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:53:42
I just signed up and it said I have to visit a BoA branch to pick up the slip of paper.  It will also charge me nearly a 20% fee on a deposit.
