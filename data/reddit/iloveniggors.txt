Wtf are you talking about? Seriously?
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:32:25
Victimless crime. Free market. And so on. 
If this was Ross you would've called him your hero. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:17:39
It's inconvenient so he will just ignore it.

Hello Bitcoin what?
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:38:24
Trying to have people murdered. Is that morally wrong enough for you? Or because he used Bitcoin to pay for the hits it's all fine?
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:17:58
But you submitted it anyway just to annoy everyone. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 09:15:59
No. 
Edit: Hilarious. The OP asks a question and only the answer "yes" is allowed. Anything else is downvoted.

I'm confused. They got access to the admin during the investigation already? In another thread i read it was only after they seized his laptop. So which is it? And if it was earlier already, is it known how they got access?
Edit: downvoted for asking a question. Well done @_date: 2015-03-31 20:21:17
Seriously? A few words in a username on the internet offends you? Damn, i feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:23:19
Why do you hate freedom and the free market?
@_date: 2015-03-31 08:38:46
That makes sense. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 22:10:10
He obviously should've used Bitcoin where no such scams happen!
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:45:31
Stop making up things just because he is your drugs hero. It's pathetic. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:04:02
Anything to excuse the actions of your drugs hero, right. You use drugs and Bitcoin, so did he. So what could he possibly do wrong. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:15:01
Still doesn't make any sense. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:35:55
Legal theft?? wtf are you talking about. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:59:37
Most people here would sell their mother for a few coins. So yes, you are right. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:28:04


Uh no. It won't. Stop making up ridiculous facts just because he is your drugs hero.
