Sorry, that's a crap position to take. I mean sure, you CAN do that but a better approach to take is each time there is a fork you have access to new coins that cost you $0 (zero cost basis approach). You can then declare capital gains only when you sell them at market value later. But if you want to pay income tax up front on the market value the day of the fork (and use that as your cost basis when you sell them), it's up to you.

It's all part of the virtuous feedback loop to increase business adoption. By patronizing businesses that accept bitcoins you create positive results for these businesses who then share results with their friends which increases business adoption and user adoption further etc... etc...
By continuing to hold and replenish your own bitcoins you benefit from their purchasing power increase resulting from increased adoption as well which can more than offset any transaction fees.
Why would anybody not do this? It's win-win.

The pre-order was 1 BTC (which at the time the project started was around $130). Hopefully there will be good competing efforts to help keep a lid on the price.

Alright, fair enough. I'll set aside any further discussion of the BG solution for now. Going back to your earlier statement:


If you review Satoshi's Whitepaper, it outlines part of the problem they were trying to solve (  ):


allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party.
Are you saying that the subsequent solution outlined is not an efficient payment system? If so, what alternative solutions would you suggest that are better/more efficient and yet still offer the desired properties (allowing transactions without need of a trusted third party)?
Edit: Or are you questioning the whole premise of a decentralized trust free payment network as being something that's needed in the first place?

Give it some time; NZ only banned software patents last year.


I would strongly disagree. The defenses for such an 'asset' have been eroding for years and this makes perfect sense. After all, how defensible is an idea? And that's all a software patent represents, a useful idea encoded as software that allows one to perform some useful function.
Consider this possibility: What's to stop me from simply reverse-engineering your tech and starting a clone of it in NZ or any other location where your patent doesn't apply?


This is a common myth used to justify patents but it doesn't hold any water. Bitcoin did just fine without any patents whatsoever and so will future innovative ideas. In fact, I've directly seen (as have others) how patents are wielded in direct opposition to innovation.

You'll hear quite often here that you shouldn't invest more in Bitcoin than you are willing to lose and that's the truth. Bitcoin is a relatively new and experimental digital currency that started as an open source voluntary internet project. There is no central company or servers behind it, only a community of enthusiasts and growing commercial interest as well.
As such bitcoins can be quite volatile in price as people's interest in the currency waxes and wanes; also news comes out on a daily basis regarding new retailers that are adopting it for payment or governments making announcements of whether and how they want to regulate it. 
You'll also find many detractors and trolls here in who see Bitcoin as nothing more than a get rich scam, a ponzi scheme or "tulip mania". Often these are the same people who invested money they couldn't afford to lose in Bitcoin or some other risky investment and then lost it and are butt hurt over it. Be sure to listen to what they have to say, but be aware that many myths/misunderstandings still exist. Best to inform yourself from a number of sources. Here are a few more:

No, the previous transaction never confirmed because it was  dust (with insufficient fee). Therefore neither that transaction or my subsequent transaction made it into a block.
I'm just telling you what happened. Believe whatever you want.

Then bet your $2500 here on a short position.
You should make a bundle if the price goes from it's current $660 to $100. FYI, many other people are there making the same bet (some with leverage!).
Edit: The gist is, you wire $2500 there and can now borrow $2500 worth of bitcoins (3.788 BTC) that you immediately sell at $660 per. Then, when the price drops to $100 you buy back the bitcoins (now worth $378.80) to close out your position for a tidy profit of ($2500 - $378.80 - exchange fees) =~ $2100. If you want leverage you can borrow $5000 worth of bitcoins against your $2500 deposited and double your profits. Of course, if the price of bitcoins rises you could lose your entire deposit on a margin call.
Edit2: So, do you have the balls to short Bitcoin? Are you man enough? Or are you just talking sh*t.

In a general market crash there tends to be a flight to cash ("cash is king"). Therefore this would be a good test of how the market sees bitcoins...
If it's seen primarily as a speculative asset, then one might expect a sell off of bitcoins correlating with a sell off in other speculative assets.
If it's seen as the equivalent to cash or an improved version of cash, then we might expect a pop in value as it moves inversely to the stock market.

All value is "extrinsic", that is, value is only placed upon an item by someone's perception of what that item is worth.
Following this line of reasoning, for an item to have intrinsic value it would need to be conscious in order to place a value upon itself. Most items are not conscious, or at least not self aware as we understand it.
Items that are conscious, aka humans, typically place an infinite or near infinite value on themselves (humans and the self preservation instinct). However humans can have both an extrinsic and intrinsic value at the same time since, while an individual human may place a high value on themselves, other humans may only perceive them as having value to them as a worker to be paid an hourly rate or with no value at all (the "useless eaters" thesis).

It was relatively easy to get the cooperation of a majority of miners in the case you mentioned where a vulnerability was found and exploited, because reversing that transaction (by forking the blockchain) served to preserve the integrity of the Bitcoin network (limited issuance of coins) and thus the value of the network. If some similar bug/vulnerability was discovered today, you would likely see a similar response.
However, it would be much harder to get the cooperation of a majority of miners in a case where reversal of the transaction was seen to benefit a single party or special interest group. This would destroy the integrity of the Bitcoin network (in particular "neutrality" of transaction processing), and consequently the value of the network would be in jeopardy. You would literally be asking miners to work against their own interests by destroying the "mine" they are working in and retiring from that source of income. Consider the sum of money you would have to come up with to encourage a majority of miners to make that kamikaze decision and then the logistics of distributing that money quickly and fairly world wide. It would be a challenge even for a Nation state at this point.

The weakness is typically in the operating system and other applications, web browsers etc... you may be running on the same node as the bitcoin wallet. It only takes a single vulnerability in one of these applications being exploited and suddenly you have a trojan installed capable of taking your wallet file and keylogging your password.
Banks are much more careful about the software they run on their banking cores and there are typically more layers of security around these cores as well.

Regarding your theory, could someone with a lot of money be running a bot to push the price up and down (manipulation)? Sure, that could be happening and they could even keep it going for a while, but eventually such a player will run out of coins on one side or the other if the market makes a major move in one direction.

Notice that there are bids for about 2800 BTC at &gt; $725 USD per. So they could handle $2 million USD in sales instantaneously before driving the price of BTC below that on this particular exchange. However, they likely have accounts on multiple exchanges. As the price drops, people would need to spend more BTC to buy the same items and bitpay adjusts the price of items in BTC accordingly before you even purchase.
In short, they should be able to always sell right away except under extreme market conditions. Also the more valuable bitcoins become, the larger/deeper the market gets.

The difference would be that if a customer uses Bitcoin, all the store might know is that some amounts of bitcoins was transferred from a certain Bitcoin address to the store Bitcoin address in payment for something.
The Bitcoin address is the analogy of the credit card number. The main difference is that, unlike a credit card number, just knowing this address would not be useful for initiating additional payments from that address. In fact, the address is public information that everyone already knows by reviewing the public blockchain.
You need the private key for the address which is never revealed to the receiver of the payment. This is why Bitcoin is referred to as a "push" based system whereas credit cards are "pull" based. The store, or anyone else with your number can just rack up additional charges on your credit card as they wish (pull); whereas only the holder of a Bitcoin private key can initiate additional charges (push).

Let's say you tried this 4 months ago (Sept 6th). You bought 100 BTC (for $118 each on Sept 6th) and immediately sell them on Mt. Gox for 10% more $129.80 locking in a profit of **$1180** which you are just getting today after having had your money locked up for 4 months.
Now let's say instead that you bought 100 BTC on Sept 6th for $118 each and just sit on it. Today you sell all 100 BTC at $930 locking in a profit of **$81200**.
So yes, go ahead and "lock in" your 10% gain 4 months from now, but realize why other people might find that a little bit boring. Also, don't expect that it's guaranteed either as Mt. Gox could easily go out of business in that time frame or might not let you withdraw into USD ever.

Inflation is a far stronger force for causing 'pooling at the top'. Consider that as items become more expensive through inflation and the salaries of the lower and middle class fail to keep up, this means the lower and middle classes become more impoverished as time goes by. Meanwhile, the rich get richer because they either already own productive assets (corporations, mines, factories etc...) that gain in value through inflation, or they are close to the money spigot (investment bankers with a cheap and virtually unlimited line of credit from the central bank) which allows them to borrow at a lower rate and lend out at a higher rate to others collecting the difference (rent seeking).

Well for one thing if these merchants use Bitcoin they wouldn't be able to take advantage of infrastructure that other merchants take for granted such as Bitpay. That's because using Bitpay still requires a bank account for depositing your fiat funds upon conversion.
This means they would potentially have to hold their bitcoins for some time before they could spend or convert it, while being fully at the mercy of price swings with few ways to hedge their exposure.

I don't disagree with your earlier numbers, but the trajectory of transaction growth seems exponential... whether it will remain exponential or level off quickly in the future remains to be seen.

He's referring to/including the block reward as part of that fee as well.
See the 'Cost Per Transaction' line item here:
However, as we know the block reward will be cut in half roughly every 4 years (Every 210000 blocks - 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 BTC etc...). Another consideration is if Bitcoin continues to be successful, then the USD value of bitcoins could continue increasing meaning even lower nominal block rewards could be worth more in USD tomorrow than they are today.
Basically we are paying that higher fee indirectly through inflation of the monetary base.

Let's be honest. Every currency in existence competes with every other currency in existence and this is no different with cryptocurrencies. Ethereum is still in very early development and it remains to be seen whether it will even be viable, let alone a competitor for Bitcoin. There are many security issues in particular to resolve in order to build an effective platform for general purpose smart contracts.
Give it time and I'm sure the market will eventually sort out what value Ethereum has.

I would turn that statement inside out:
Bitcoin is a technical solution that uses an incentive based scheme as a means to make consensus in highly distributed large-scale systems, which would otherwise never be able to reach consensus.
For Bitcoin to convey its incentive efficiently it must convey value efficiently and value equals payments. It *cannot be anything else but an efficient payment system* or it would not be the solution that it is.

It's not a "jump" but rather an in-chain mixer/accumulator that allows you to put coins of a certain denomination in and later withdraw them to a different address. Doing so **breaks any linkage** between the address they came from and are withdrawn to since others can be depositing and withdrawing coins as well from the same mixer.
Now imagine that every transaction is either a deposit or withdrawal from a mixer. You deposit to accumulate funds and you withdraw when you want to spend funds. No one can tell where the funds being withdrawn/spent came from.

There may also be marginally more buyers/investors who see a brighter future for bitcoins after hearing the news that more merchants are on board.

Even though it's possible to generate a multisig address in the way I mentioned, now that I understand more about what you are trying to do I don't think that approach is fit for your purpose.
Why? Presumably the hash of this document would be public (known by all) and since the method used to generate multiple private keys from that hash would also be known, those private keys would be known by all parties as well which defeats the whole point of multi-sig (each party knows only their private key).
Make sense?
So, I think a better approach would be for each party to generate their own key privately for building a given multisig address. Then, embed that multisig address in the document you are hashing to demonstrate proof of existence. In other words, reverse the order of operations.
If you'd like to see a nice working example of a multisig wallet that allows multiple users to generate their own private keys and then create a multisig address by consensus, this is the one I've been playing with lately:

I share your interest in personal freedom and autonomy. My main concern with continuous bidirectional transfer is that it sounds complex and difficult to implement by comparison to the simplicity of implementing bootstrapped distribution; but I will withhold judgement until I see what comes of attempts at a working implementation.
That is the beauty of open source software; different groups can push this technology in multiple directions simultaneously. To your original point though, a winning approach will likely be chosen by the majority of end users (tyranny of the majority/market place?) while the minority continue to toil away on alternative approaches in increasing isolation.

The number of fills allowed would be in the text of the prescription document itself and the entire prescription would be signed by the doctor's private key to verify it was legitimate.
The blockchain would only be used to verify whether the prescription was filled, or perhaps also to verify it is "registered" (exists) by putting a digest of the prescription document in the blockchain as can already be done today. Example:
The prescription document itself could always be kept private, though shared between doctor and pharmacist systems.

The author makes a point but fails to back it up with anything substantial. Bitcoin is a protocol that guarantees all transactions on the Bitcoin network are broadcast and copied by ever participant (full node). That does not sound like something that would be useful for preventing copying.

No it does not, but I agree that using the term "infinitely divisible" is misleading. A more accurate term would be "arbitrarily divisible". That is, with a hard fork it would be possible to add as many additional digits of precision as desired.
The reason this does not remove the property of deflation is that you are still not increasing the amount of bitcoins that will exist. You are merely increasing the number of slices you can divide them into (just like slicing a pizza into 100,000,000 pieces doesn't make any more pizza than slicing it into 6 pieces).

The assumption you make here is that the *only* reason a person would invest their money in something is to earn interest, specifically a higher rate of return than they can earn by just holding their money as savings (the "risk free" 10% rate you mentioned).
However, there is one obvious counter-example to that assumption: "crowdfunding". A group of people may, in aggregate, decide to invest in/donate to some venture they personally believe to be important and useful without expecting any monetary return at all.
Instead they hope to receive a return on their investment of another form, a new or improved product or service that didn't previously exist, becoming available to them. The existence and wild success of projects like kickstarter show that this is a viable investment model:
Also, I would disagree with this statement:


The reason an economy comes about is to meet the resource needs of participants in that economy, not to facilitate the flow of capital. Capital flowing is a *side-effect of*, not the reason for having an economy.


Capital will continue to flow even in a deflationary situation because people still need resources to survive (food, shelter etc...). People do not starve themselves so that they may hoard their capital and take it to the grave with them.

My take is that 5,000 transaction a day figure could be from this month (January) when the story was written. I don't know if he's cherry picking that data or not but if that's a typical day we could be looking at 155,000 transactions for the month of January (or more if they are continuing to grow). That would be a pretty extreme spike if true.
He also said "What we processed in November and December was two times what we did in September and October," which based on that graph would mean:
* September - 15,000
* October - 20,000
* November + December = 2 x (15k + 20k) = 70,000
Edit: which would mean 55,000 in November and 15,000 in December (Christmas lull?)


* Mining hardware - Probably a small number of high value transactions due to the cost of this equipment -  - Miners have to keep buying equipment to keep up with network difficulty.
* Gift cards - This was probably the vast majority of transactions and has become very popular as a way to exchange bitcoins for store credit in the form of electronic gift cards; allows spending bitcoins offline at most major chain stores. 
* Gold Vendor - Amagi Metals (  ) - Probably a fair number of bitcoin holders/speculators chose to exchange bitcoins for bullion at the most recent all time high price which got close to the price of 1 oz of Gold; seems like a form of profit taking to lock in gains.

The general state of software security and especially end-user security practices is the problem. The community is just a messenger, and on occasion they will be quick to point out when someone didn't follow even the most basic steps (cold wallets, two factor authentication etc...) to secure their funds.
That doesn't mean we should shoot the messenger. It means we should be paying better attention to the message being delivered and proactively applying what we learn.

Or, what if some amazing successor to Bitcoin appears on the scene and suddenly all market demand migrates to this Bitcoin v2?
There are many scenarios where the value could conceivably drop to zero or more likely near zero. Of course, Bitcoin would likely still have some value as a collectible (being the "first" decentralized cryptocurrency), but that value could still be very very low. It doesn't have to reach absolute zero for it to fail as a worldwide currency.

The 6 day wait is so that coinbase can hedge against the (very real) possibility that your $100 transaction will be rejected/reversed by your bank. Even after 6 days, the transaction could still be reversed but the probability is then low enough that coinbase can accept the percentage of losses/reversals (from scammers) as a cost of doing business.
If you don't like the 6 day wait, then use localbitcoins and cash to pay for it rather than your bank account.

No you *cannot* safely ignore them. The moment you try to perform a new spend, the typical wallet will likely try to use these unconfirmed transactions in a spend and thus your new transaction will stay unconfirmed as well until these are resolved/dropped.

The reason this is a bad idea is because Bitcoin is by nature zero-trust. If you were to allow someone(s) to have control over deciding what is and is not a theft, then you would take away that key characteristic because you'd have to trust them to do the right thing.
In fact, you would be making Bitcoin almost exactly like government fiat where a government gets to decide (through the court systems) what constitutes an actual theft and when or if to return funds. We know by experience that the government often does the wrong thing and uses their capability to confiscate money from innocent parties.
There really is no point in doing this with Bitcoin. You might as well just stick with government fiat if you insist on having some government babysit your money.

Your betting strategy does not matter. Gambler's Ruin says that:
"A gambler with finite wealth, playing a fair game (that is, each bet has expected value zero to both sides) will eventually go broke against an opponent with infinite wealth."
Now of course the online casino does not have "infinite" wealth. However, by limiting the maximum bet size to a percentage of the house pot, the house can effectively "simulate" infinite wealth since you can never bankrupt the house in a single/final bet.
This guarantees that over time anyone playing against the house long enough will eventually lose all their money.
Just so we're clear: I'm not attacking your idea of a 0% house edge; I think it's a great and competitive strategy for running a gambling site. What I am attacking is your provably false claim that "If you bet for long enough you will breakeven!". Gambler's ruin is the proof against that claim.
p.s. If you do not limit the maximum bet size as I indicated, then another possible outcome is for players to bankrupt the house (house goes broke).

When presented with the opportunity to maintain a larger balance in your wallet vs. taking delivery of a finely crafted power tool that you could use for all sorts of productive activities, the choice was obvious.

Nothing would happen to the coins you hold because they were created before the fork (and so exist on both sides of the fork). However, funds received after the fork could be at risk since they could have already been spent to somewhere else on the other side of the fork (double spend). If the fork was resolved, all blocks on the losing side would be invalidated and so the mining rewards on that side would disappear. Similarly, double spends on the losing side would be vanished in favor of the spends on the winning side.

@_date: 2014-05-27 17:44:38


Not quite. The house can foil this strategy by setting a minimum bet size (and they typically do) which has the side effect of preventing this strategy from working for the player.
If the player starts with too small a bank roll or their bank roll shrinks through a sufficient number of losses, then the lower bet limit makes it impossible for the player to stay in the game to recover.
p.s. Another effective lower bet limit is the divisibility of the currency being used.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:49:37


In a way you are quite correct. The value of the dollar is determined by an obligation to pay taxes in it. Therefore citizens of the U.S. are coerced into needing dollars and there is no truly "free market" in dollars. Also, the U.S. tries to artificially maintain demand for dollars abroad by coercing foreign states into using it and directly punishing, with military intervention, those who deviate from using it as a standard reserve currency.
And this makes bitcoins all the more remarkable because people around the world voluntarily seek to acquire them with no coercion needed whatsoever and despite the threat of intervention by hostile governments like the U.S. who will inevitably feel threatened by the rise of a free market currency that threatens the supremacy of their mandated currency.

Well I think creating the multisig directly from the document doesn't work for the reason I mentioned (everyone needs to generate their own private key for the multisig separately/privately). That leaves:
* Embedding an already generated multisig address in the document or...
* Having the private key holders for that multisig address sign the document with their keys (before hashing it and storing the hash in the block chain).
Adobe already supports signing documents (although using digital certificate private keys rather than bitcoin private keys):
Having the document signed is a better way of proving that it is approved by the private key holders.

Yes, it is complicated. Under a deflationary economy investment would not stop entirely but merely change in character. Investment would primarily occur through savings/self-funding or crowd sourced funding in ventures that a large group of people wanted to support. For example, if a large group of people in a town really wanted a frozen yogurt shop they could chip in a couple of satoshis each to help get one kick started. If not enough people wanted it, or if someone wasn't willing to personally fund it (because they want to own and operate that kind of business more than they want to hold their deflating currency), then it wouldn't happen and that's okay.
This is quite different from the current investment approach that blindly seeks a risk-adjusted percentage return on a loan in an inflationary currency often leading to poor investments and over-investment. For example, a bank may think it's a great idea to issue a loan to a frozen yogurt shop to get a certain percentage return, while ignoring that five other frozen yogurt shops were just funded and opened nearby. 
Banks providing "easy" financing leads to over investment which leads to market saturation, subsequent business failures and failed loans. This can lead to bank balance sheet issues and the perceived "need" for bank bailouts etc...

I believe that distribution will be smoothed out over time since even the top holders of bitcoins don't have the luxury of conjuring up new currency on demand, they will eventually have to spend their bitcoins purchasing services and products from others.
Also, when we look at the applicability of pareto distributions we have to consider bitcoins as just one in the family of all cryptocurrencies; some Bitcoin holders have already started diversifying into these alternatives.
Another thing to consider is the market cap of all cryptos together is just a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of national fiats in circulation. Hence you would expect major distortions in ownership distribution of such a small percentage of a much larger marketplace (just like ownership interest in a startup company is highly concentrated in the hands of the few).

There is another misunderstanding.
Bitcoin is self regulating which is why government regulation is not necessary for the core protocol. It would be equivalent to having the government attempt to regulate that 2+2 = 4 or that when you make an HTTP request you get a well formed HTTP response. Totally unnecessary. The protocol regulates itself.
The best government regulators can do is attempt to regulate the interface points between the Bitcoin ledger and national fiats (exchanges and merchant point of sale) but even that is a difficult proposition for the same reasons regulating the flow of cash is difficult.

I'm sure most people would think it's more fair that they receive a bigger slice of the wealth distribution as well, but that does not make it so. There is a reason it's this way.
I think the impetus is on you to explain why the family of all cryptocurrencies will deviate from this. I postulate that wealth will be concentrated in a handful of cryptocurrencies in a similar distribution (80/20 rule).
Do I claim that Bitcoin the currency in its current form will remain in this handful? No... but it certainly is at this point in time.

I would do the reverse. The doctor's system hashes the prescription turning it into a private key and matching Bitcoin address. Then, when the the pharmacist fills the prescription their system first checks that the address has a balance of 0 and then sends 1 satoshi to the address at the same time they fill the prescription in order to mark it as used. If a prescription can be filled multiple times, then they send multiple satoshis, one for each time filled up to the prescription limit.

If you put a ceiling price, then if there was sufficient demand the market would keep buying at your price until you had no bitcoins left to maintain the ceiling.
Similarly, if you put a floor on and the market entirely lost interest in bitcoins you would eventually either run out of money to maintain the floor or be left holding all of the (now worthless) bitcoins.
TL;DR; ceilings and floors cannot be maintained forever, even by central banks.

What does "lose" mean when talking about an open source project?
Did Linux "lose" to Windows because it didn't reach mass adoption? No, it just stays around continuing to improve as long as a group of people are interested in maintaining/extending/using it. That's because the source code is out there for anyone to use or modify.
The same goes for Bitcoin. Sure, it may not end up being used for every single conceivable payment use case, but it doesn't have to be. It just has to have a niche to continue to exist and thrive.

It's quite simple really. Alt-coins absorb a certain percentage of the market demand for cryptocurrencies. Increased demand for alts directly correlates with decreased demand for bitcoins and thus puts downward pressure on the price of bitcoins.
So if your sole investment was bitcoins and you wanted its purchasing power to appreciate, you would likely be talking down alt-coins.
It's the same debate you see between holders of bitcoins and government-fiat holders. The smarter fiat-holders realize their purchasing power will drop as more of the demand goes into bitcoins and so they naturally hate bitcoins. The dumb government fiat-holders either don't know about it, don't care about it, or blindly follow the arguments (i.e. "bitcoin is evil") of the smarter fiat-holders.

If it's true that the theft occurred over a long period of time, then yes we should blame Mt. Gox for gross incompetence. This is how small problems become large problems. If they'd had even the most basic of audit processes in place, there's a far better chance they could have detected an anomaly in their books before it grew to a 744K BTC black hole. Given the magnitude of the loss, it's almost inconceivable they didn't know of its existence for quite a while which turns this into potentially criminal fraud if they continued operations while knowing they were already insolvent.

I made the suggestion a long time ago that bitcoiners, who were mostly male at the time (and likely still are) encourage their significant others (usually female) to try out using Bitcoin for shopping online and off as an alternative to shopping with credit cards.
As I recall I was shouted down by a brigade of folks from SRS for being "sexist" for even making the suggestion. I guess saying women make or influence 85% of all purchasing decisions is the politically correct way of saying "women like to shop". Who knew? I didn't.
Anyhow, I can report some success using this approach with females in my life since then. If nothing else, it's been useful getting feedback on how easy or hard the technology was for new and inexperienced users to apply, especially technology like mobile wallets.

That's volatility (the value of a bit coin fluctuating). You are saying that stands in the way of adoption because it is introducing an element of risk to the process. I agree.
Now if bitcoin price crashed that would increase the volatility (The problem you pointed out). So how would that be the "best thing" for bit coins? Unless you want bitcoin to self-destruct it wouldn't be good at all.
A currency peg (the next thing you are talking about) just adds counterparty risk to bitcoins because now you need a third party to maintain that peg/exchange rate. Anyway, we already have a virtual currency pegged to the USD, namely your bank account balance whose virtual value can be viewed through the bank website.

The bitcoin address associated with each numbered donation would be shown on the lottery website before the winner was selected (along with a computed hash of all the addresses in order to show the list is not tampered with).
When the desired amount of donations was reached you could make the selection of the winning address using the hash from the next block in the blockchain.
This hash is impossible to predict in advance and so it is "provably fair".
Last 3 hex digits = f0e = 3854 (decimal). The winner is whoever made donation  (This is a simplified example - you might need to multiply the number by a factor to normalize it to the actual number of donators).

You would need wallet software specifically modified to be devious and generate two transactions every time you do a spend. The first transaction will be the 'legitimate' spend you are trying to do and the second will be a spend of the same funds to an address you already control so that you can try to retrieve/keep the funds.
Only one of these transactions will be accepted by the network. The problem is that you can't control exactly how fast each transaction will propagate across the network. It's a race and only one will be succeed. As I understand it, Bitpay (one of the major online point of sale solutions) already attempts to detect this situation by having multiple nodes on the Bitcoin network.

Here's an anecdote for you to consider:
I have a friend with a teenage daughter who would pester him to buy things for her online (using her allowance/birthday/holiday-gift money). He used to just use his own credit card to purchase the items for her because she is too young to be trusted with a credit card herself.
Recently he decided to take a different approach. He installed a Bitcoin wallet on her mobile device and signed her up for snapcard.  - Since then, whenever she wants to spend her money online he sends some bitcoins to her wallet and she goes shopping. He receives an email update every time she makes a purchase so he can safely monitor what she is buying.
Last I heard, she bought herself some clothing, a camera + film and some event tickets. She's been telling her friends about it as well; word is spreading. There's a growing army of youth who would disagree with your assessment that this technology is "shitty for consumers".

You are starting with the assumption that the financial system and specifically the money supply *must* be managed by a central authority. However, there are many who believe exactly the opposite. When you create a centrally managed economy, you immediately introduce incentives to those responsible for managing (manipulating) the money supply and other aspects of the economy, to reward those who are politically well-connected to them. This is known as crony-capitalism and this is the system we are now under.
Alternatively, some believe that all aspects of the economy should be left alone including what the market chooses for money. These same people were also early adopters of Bitcoin. It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will always remain a niche currency or if it will have broader utility. You could be correct that it may end up as only a reserve currency or used for remittance between countries. Time will tell.

Normally, spreads between prices on difference exchanges would be smoothed out via the process of arbitrage. However, due to the difficulties of moving national fiat between exchanges caused by direct government interference, this process of arbitrage is disrupted creating structural price discrepancies.
Other causes of short term price discrepancies can arise due to the small size and relative illiquidity of the market and consequently slippage when large market orders are filled.

Dogecoin got some nice press with the bobsled thing so a few people bought it on a whim and the price popped. Then traders who have been losing their asses all week on the sideways motion of Bitcoin (they prefer breakouts up or down), got involved and the price popped more.
Means nothing - just another pump/dump altcoin like 100 times before. Dogecoin has a long way to go... could it get pumped 100-1000% higher in one week? Sure. End of the world? Hardly. If you're worried about it, then go buy DOGE and see what happens. It's a great way to get directly schooled in how altcoins work.

Only the miner who finds a block can put txns in that particular block. Since it takes 10 minutes on average to find a block, yes that is why it usually takes 10 minutes to be verified (if the transaction is well-formed and includes a fee that is acceptable to the miner).

Yes, this is the essence of Gresham's Law. You spend the bad money (dollars) first to get rid of it as soon as possible and you hold on to the good money (bitcoins, silver and gold) as long as possible.
With previous versions of good money (gold and silver) this ended up being a problem because it led to hoarding and the end of circulation of the good money when bad (paper) money with the same nominal/face value was introduced. However, this same effect doesn't happen with Bitcoin for a number of reasons:
* Since Bitcoin is effectively infinitely divisible, hoarding doesn't lead to the end of circulation but rather the circulation of smaller and smaller amounts at a greater and greater exchange rate (deflation). In practice this means the Bitcoin economy can run just fine on any amount that remains in circulation, no matter how small (a single coin or even less).
* There is always exchange rate uncertainty with bitcoins. This means some people will want to spend their coins today rather than exchange them at an unknown rate tomorrow.
* Holders of bitcoins have a finite longevity and a need for physical resources (like food and housing) while they are still alive. Consequently, they will spend some just to pay their living expenses.
* Also since bitcoins don't have a fixed nominal exchange rate with dollars that law isn't really applicable here.
The opposing view is here:

You are confusing cause and effect. It is the easy availability of loans which **caused** the rapid expansion and costs of higher education. I'm sorry you were impoverished by that same system.
If you were to eliminate the loans and subsidies, college education would become affordable again. The same can be said of overpriced houses/mortgages and any other part of the economy that is subsidized in such a way. 
I reiterate, a system built on unrepayable loans (as our fractional reserve monetary system is, where the very money itself is created as unrepayable government debt) is destructive and poisonous. By unrepayable I mean that the only way to "repay" said debt is by issuing ever more debt in a ruthless and exponentially growing manner. Do you truly believe this is sustainable?

"How long until the NSA has secretly forced calculator manufacturers to produce calculators that sometimes generate the wrong answer to 2+2=4?"
Yes, that is exactly how improbable it is. Basically, ASICS just run a single calculation over and over again and it's trivial to verify whether an ASIC is operating correctly, just like it would be for any other simple calculator. If an ASIC fails in any statistically meaningful way to produce the correct output people will notice this, and then no one will buy it.
And yes, I'm aware that NSA has compromised random number generators in the past, but that is a far cry from generating a very specific functional output (SHA256 etc...).

Yes, the only problem I see with it is if someone (an attacker) performed a denial of service attack by pre-sending satoshis to such addresses to render the prescription useless before it could be filled by the pharmacist (remember, anyone can send any amount to any address).
To prevent this attack you would have to generate unused (one-use) "prescription fill" addresses that are included in the prescription document itself and keep the prescription (or at least that part of it), secret. That way, the attacker has no way of knowing which addresses will be used to mark a prescription filled until *after* they are already used.
Edit: Having the prescription signed by the Doctor's private key would guaranty the authenticity of both the prescription and the "prescription fill" addresses it contains.

You borrow some bitcoins and sell them immediately. Then you wait for the exchange rate of bitcoins to drop much lower. Once it does, you buy the bitcoins back, repay your loan and keep the difference as profit.
The problem is, if the exchange rate goes up high enough you may be forced to buy back bitcoins at a loss to repay your original bitcoin loan. This is called a short squeeze because you are literally squeezing the trader out of his short position.

Not really. For example, the Federal Reserve has taken on an absurdly large position in Treasuries and Mortgage backed securities that it will have a much harder time getting out of than someone trying to sell a mere $1 Million USD worth of bitcoins.
In fact, it would be trivial to dump 1500 BTC at Bitstamp. There would be some slippage of course, but not much more than you'd expect from dumping 1,500 shares out of 12,000,000 shares of a $10 billion dollar company.

To go from 0 to 1M bitcoins requires updating the shared ledger known as the blockchain, which you can think of as just a file maintained by all participating nodes in the network.
To update the ledger requires submitting a new transaction to the network that follows the rules established and enforced by auditor nodes (known as "miners"). If you aren't following the rules, then your transaction will simply be rejected by the network. A transaction that says change my balance from 0 to 1M clearly doesn't follow the rules and that is why it will fail every time.
Edit: To address Mu's point, since the network rules are enforced by software there could be undetected bugs in that software allowing undesirable transactions to enter the network. Such bugs have been found before and fixed but there is no guaranty all possible bugs have been found and squashed. Still, the market cap of bitcoins is high enough that a considerable incentive exists and has existed for years now to find and exploit any remaining vulnerabilities. The number of eyeballs on this over such an extended period of time suggests this is likely some of the most (if not THE most) secure software on the planet.

No, I think you misunderstand. Bitcoin would not be a valid solution to the Byzantine General's problem if it was not able to offer participating nodes an incentive of some sort.

You are completely wrong as usual; The best thing for stability/less volatility would be for the price to be several orders of magnitude above where it is today. At a much higher exchange rate volatility would be reduced because the value of all transactions in a given day would become a smaller and smaller fraction of the entire market cap of Bitcoin.
You see a similar outcome in stocks; as the market cap increases, volatility typically decreases:

While any transaction using an input from a prior zero confirm transaction will "go through" to the network it will never be included in a block until/unless the prior transaction is confirmed.

Actually it does go away because the Bitcoin rich cannot play the same tricks with Bitcoin that have been played with fiat currency. That is, they cannot work in conjunction with central banks like the investment bankers of today to "print up" arbitrary new amounts of currency with which to finance the purchase of anything they wish at little or no interest.
They can only spend their bitcoins, thus distributing them more evenly to others or produce something of value to sell in order to accumulate more bitcoins. But due to deflationary pressures/increasing value it will become harder and harder to accumulate bitcoins in significant numbers.

First of all it would be impossible for B.G. to buy a majority of bitcoins as the price would immediately and rapidly rise even out of his reach. But lets say he did manage to acquire a large number stealthily and then sat on them for a long time. That wouldn't really matter because the market would just use the remaining supply as easily as the whole supply (remember that each coin is divisible into 100000000 units).


He could only crash the price once and then he wouldn't have any more bitcoins (unless he started buying again). In fact this scenario has already happened over and over in previous Bitcoin bubbles. This is in contrast to the Federal Reserve who can print up as many dollars as they want for as long as they want and flood the market continuously.


Not necessarily. In fact I would say that an economy based on and requiring an inflationary currency has done far more damage to itself and our environment than one built on a more sustainable approach. It's time to consider the alternatives:
I consider it advantageous that deflation would encourage us to only buy the necessities and reuse/recycle what we have (rather than throwing it away) thus avoiding excessive growth (over/malinvestment) and needless destruction/abuse of the environment.

If there is any ambiguity like that, then the miner that discovers the block is able to choose one of the transactions arbitrarily for inclusion (either based on which one they saw first or which one has the higher fee).
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:26:08
If a flaw were discovered that allowed arbitrarily discovering private keys for any bitcoin address (SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 cracked) then price would drop to $0 since there would be no way to defend a non-zero balance. However, that's pretty unlikely.

Every market participant attempts to "tilt trading in their favor", yourself included. They are doing nothing wrong. The mistake you are making is trying to use coinbase as a trading platform, which is not what it was intended to be. It's a retail platform.
You will get similar results if you go to a coin shop, buy a gold coin and then try to sell it back to the coin shop half an hour later. The fees and taxes will eat any potential profit unless a truly extraordinary market move occurs.

Actually this is a fairly clever proposal because it:
* Solves the dilemma of how to invest in altcoins (by making it unnecessary to choose between different altcoins; just hold bitcoins and you get altcoins created based on your proof-of-stake in bitcoins for "free")
* Maintains demand for bitcoins even when extremely innovative altcoins come out.
* Creates an incentive to not park your bitcoins on exchanges because you always want to be in possession of the private keys for unspent outputs when a new alt-currency spawns (so that *you* get the altcoins as a reward rather than the exchange owners).
* Brings instant attention and a user base to altcoins that might otherwise receive little interest.

These guys can handle a trade that large (and larger) easily (minimum trade size $25k USD) paid for with bank wire:
They can also recommend a safe wallet for you to use since they do not custody Bitcoin funds on behalf of their customers. A hardware wallet would probably be ideal for larger amounts like that (trezor, ledger etc...).
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:53:44
IANAL, but here is my opinion FWIW. With regard to coinbase, since they hold the private keys rather than you it seems to me more comparable to a traditional bank account. That is, if you have a bank app on your phone (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Chase etc...) with a balance of $10k or more, would you have to declare that at U.S. customs? Of course not. So how would having a similar balance at coinbase differ? Also, you could simply delete the coinbase app before you cross the border and reinstall it later if you are that worried about it.
Now, if you have a crypto wallet where you hold the actual private keys on the phone itself, or you have the seed phrase for such a wallet in a file on the phone or on a sheet of paper, then that would seem to fit the definition of a "bearer instrument" where the physical holder of that instrument is considered the owner of it and would consequently need to be reported if the value in USD was above the limit.
Just as another data point for reference, there was a recent story where U.S. customs reportedly seized a traveler's bitcoins at the border but he was already a suspect in an ongoing investigation.

The mining fee is part of the bitcoin transaction and therefore determined by the creator of that transaction. Since the transaction must be signed by the creator's private keys to make it valid and the miner does not hold those keys, the miner is unable to modify the transaction fee without invalidating the transaction. They can only propagate (or not) the transaction and include it in the next block they discover (or not).

So? 
A better counterargument is that users are not "forced" to pay for service they don't use since their investment is entirely voluntary. Of course, investors hope the value of their bitcoins will increase in the future but there is no certainty of that. Therefore, an investor would see the utility of their investment possibly being realized at a future date, not immediately.

Indeed, as you've got it completely backwards. The largest telcos are beginning to back efforts to bring government regulation in order to raise the barriers to entry of the marketplace high enough to keep out any newcomers. Crony capitalism much?
Sprint today, tomorrow the rest of them. After all, it's much easier to regulate your competitors out of existence then actually innovate.


Wrong again. The internet was already headed towards complete encryption for every protocol without need of government regulation to mandate it so. HTTPS and Corporate VPNs are already standard and ubiquitous. Are you really this deluded or just shilling for the government? I can't tell.
Remember, it's the government that we find always standing in opposition to encryption:
But no worries. If government regulated networks become too oppressive, we (the users) will just work to route around such nonsense with decentralized mesh networks where government regulations won't apply.

* On a bearer item such as a physical bitcoin.
* Online, but on encrypted media where the encryption key is offline.

I completely disagree with your argument. Just because it would be crazy to make or take a loan in bitcoins does not mean it has no value. It is still a great means of exchanging value at a distance (competing with Paypal, Western Union etc...) - consider the market cap of these companies and tell me they have no value!
Also, just because you wouldn't want to loan (or borrow) bitcoins doesn't mean that the savers of bitcoins are unable to make investments. They most certainly can invest bitcoins and take the requisite risk of losing those bitcoins in the hopes that they will be sufficiently rewarded with a return of more bitcoins than they invested.
Just as there are no loans in bitcoins, there will be no interest in bitcoin denominated accounts, no "risk free" returns - but there never was such a thing in government fiat denominated accounts either; just an illusion of safe and "risk-free" insured savings shattered by the reality of thefts like that attempted in Cyprus.

This was the crux of Dan Kaminsky's talk back in 2011 on the feasibility (or lack of feasibility) of Bitcoin.
To summarize: Bitcoin can't scale to a global "used by everyone" transaction system because to do so would require miners to become "supernodes" in order to handle the data input/output capacity requirements at that level (60GB/Minute).
This kills the decentralization of Bitcoin since only a dwindling number of entities can afford to host full nodes in that scenario = aka Banks. Some discussion on this topic along with architectural changes to address scalability are proposed here.

Keep in mind that, despite what they say, hosted wallet providers can **always** take your Bitcoin merely by replacing the client side code you use to decrypt your wallet with a modified version that sends your private keys to them the next time you login.

The last one is particularly relevant to your question:
Bitcoin Days Destroyed is a measure of the transaction volume of Bitcoin. If someone has 100 BTC that they received a week ago and they spend it then 700 bitcoin days have been destroyed. If they take those 100BTC and send them to several addresses and then spend them then although the total transaction volume could be arbitrarily large the number of bitcoin days destroyed is still 700.

Yes, I also hate the term "complex mathematical equations". To the unaccustomed ear this sounds like "fag talk"
Of course a one-way SHA256 hash function has its complexities, but really all we need to focus on is the fact that **brute force computing** is required to find the hash value satisfying current difficulty requirements. That sounds more macho and that's what a miner/mining equipment is: a macho-man, a "bitcoin bouncer" that bounces out all the b.s. and only allows valid transactions into the blocks they are competing with other miners to solve/create.

I have thought about this a lot. This is much easier to do with so-called "deterministic" wallets, where all addresses are generated starting with a known seed value.
This seed value can be written down on a piece of paper as a nonsensical string of words along with instructions on how to install the deterministic wallet software and "recover" the wallet from this seed. Storing this piece of paper in a safety deposit box or somewhere else safe and then referring to it in your will or letting your significant-other and close family members know of its existence would be sufficient to pass your bitcoins on to your heirs.

You can always export your private keys and use them in a different wallet if you want.
The downside is the Electrum client relies on a network of Electrum servers to interact with the blockchain. However, the server is open source as well and so anyone can run there own if they want (it's little more than bitcoind + some additional bits).

There are no "intermediaries" or "person to person" transfers. bitcoins are ledger items transferred from one bitcoin address to another. There is no direct one-to-one correspondence between an address and a person. There is only a private key that may happen to be on a disk and that disk may belong to a person or an organization. But does that mean anything in terms of property rights? The private key could be copied and used by a 3rd party. Would love to see this argued in court someday (I'm sure we will).

It's because the legacy banking system allows transaction reversals (on ACH transactions in this case), and so coinbase is waiting what they feel is a safe amount of time until the transaction clears and becomes harder to reverse.
Unfortunately, fraudsters take advantage of this reversibility (vs. the irreversibility of Bitcoin) quite frequently.
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:50:00
Yes, but the point is even if there was only one single bitcoin (1 BTC) remaining, you could subdivide that bitcoin into smaller and smaller pieces for payment:
0.00000001 BTC = 1 Satoshi
0.00000000001 BTC = 1 mSatoshi
0.00000000000001 BTC ... and so forth.
In other words we could run the entire economy on a single bitcoin or less if we had to. You are just adding zeros to the left of the significant digits, not the right. This isn't Zimbabwe after all!

The best you could hope to do is provide support at some price level (example $50) where you enter the market and buy to prevent the price from falling below it. But even that would require vast resources though at least not unlimited (11M * $50).

Yes, that is quite possible and something you would want to consider when purchasing physical bitcoins. Is the source of your coins a trustworthy person/organization?
Of course, all doubt would be removed once you attempted to spend the value at the Bitcoin address linked with a specific physical coin in your possession. The block chain would prevent any possible double spend so if the private key for your coin was cloned multiple times, only the first person to attempt a spend would succeed. Another possibility is that your private key would be invalid (no spend possible). In either case, no inflation of bitcoins within the block chain is possible.

So you're saying BTC is not money?
The problem with loaning BTC is on the borrower's side. As the Op has indicated, it is brutal for the borrower to repay in a deflating currency, so no sane borrower who understands basic math should seek such a thing.
That becomes a problem for would-be lenders of BTC because how can you trust someone who is either insane or unable to understand basic math? Another possibility is that the purported borrower understands exactly what is at stake with the loan and is in fact a thief/scam-artist never intending to repay the loan in the first place; Again, not trustworthy.

Are you sure you aren't referring to a brain wallet?

Excellent. That was my main concern; will look forward to seeing the updates on your website that let you select the kiosk.

@_date: 2013-10-25 18:09:51
No, that shouldn't be possible. Initiating a transaction can only be done by your Electrum client and your private key never leaves the client. However, the server is used to relay the transaction. So worst case, the server could refuse to relay your transaction but it is not possible for the server to tamper with your transaction in any way (since any tampering would invalidate the transaction signature preventing any subsequent Bitcoin node in the network from accepting it).

Consider this. If 1 BTC was at an exchange rate of $100,000 USD then a fluctuation up or down by $800 USD in one day would seem pretty tiny, barely noticeable even. Now consider if the exchange rate was for $1M USD.
It is likely that the volatility will continue to decrease simply because it becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of the exchange rate as the exchange rate increases.

The same is true of the blockchain ledger, which is just a file that everyone participating in the Bitcoin network keeps a synchronized copy of. So you'll need to hack all the participants, not just a single participant. Another option is to attempt to overpower the Bitcoin network with massive computing power, becoming essentially 51% of the transaction processing capacity - but that option is swiftly evaporating as the power of the network grows exponentially and eventually it will become so cost prohibitive that even governments would be hard pressed to mount such an attack.

Consider this: There will only be 21 Million BTC ever created (less actually if you count the amounts that are "lost" over time) and there are 2.4 Billion Internet Users as of last count in 2012 (  ) and of course, the number of Users will likely go up. If these 21 Million Bitcoins could somehow be evenly distributed to all current Internet Users you would have 0.00875 BTC (or 875,000 satoshi) available on average per person, but actually there will be much less than that to go around for the reasons I just mentioned. Now you already have 1.3 BTC which is 148 times that amount. So see, you are RICH already (in Bitcoin terms)!

I think you could accomplish what you want with multi-signature escrow transactions which are built into the Bitcoin portocol.
Basically you would have the ticket proceeds sent to an escrow address that requires multiple (N) private keys to release those funds. These private keys could be distributed to N-1 parties known as Oracles who then independently verify that the rules of the lottery were followed. The Oracles will only sign an outgoing payment/transaction to a winner as defined by the public rules of the contest.

Have you looked at the Electrum bitcoin client? It creates your wallet deterministically from a seed that can be represented as random series of words, for example ""constant forest adore false green weave stop guy fur freeze giggle clock""
To recover such a wallet, you'd simply need to install the Electrum Desktop client and initiate a wallet recovery from the seed. You could easily document this process and the seed itself as an appendix to your will. You could also document some potential methods for selling the bitcoins (coinbase account or something similar).

You're starting with a really poor assumption, that these early adopters actually want to convert back to fiat. What if, instead, they only converted back what they needed to live on and the rest they used to acquire companies or build new companies, pay people's salaries etc... In other words, what if the early adopters were more interested in building a new economy to "keep the game going" instead of "cashing out" to fiat which they believe will eventually be worthless anyway?
You are quite correct that 50+ people today could not convert back into $1 million USD all at the same time without crashing the price of Bitcoin to near zero. But individually they certainly could ($1 million trades on bitstamp are not unusual). The fact that they haven't all cashed out tells you something.

There already is a virtual currency linked to the dollar. It's represented by that number you see on the computer screen when you review your USD denominated bank account balance.
Basically, that's why there will never be something like the BCD. It's because, just like a bank, you'd need to introduce some counterparty (and thus counterparty risk) to peg your virtual currency to the USD so you could exchange it 1 for 1 into USD when you wanted. Bitcoin does not have counterparty risk but also by its nature has no guaranteed exchange rate with USD.

Wealth inequality (hoarding by the 1%) is already pretty extreme within the existing world economy:
The reason there isn't more volatility is that the top 1% who own the majority of wealth really have no one to sell their possessions to at a reasonable price since everyone else is so poor comparatively. So, the 1%'s choices are limited. They could either give away their wealth for practically free (or extremely low cost), making huge waves in the market (volatility) along the way, or they can continue to hold on to their wealth. The same will be true with Bitcoin ownership - it's just more obvious and transparent on the block chain.
The wealthiest Bitcoin owners literally can't cash out without driving the price of Bitcoin to near zero. However, they can slowly convert to fiat just in order to pay their living expenses and live quite comfortably. I think that is what most of the early adopters will choose to do.

Keep in mind that the supply of bitcoins are finite (unlike government fiat which can be printed to infinity) and that some of that supply is not for sale at any price either because the current holders simply don't want to sell it or because it's not available in a sale-able form (on the exchange at this point in time).
So any attempt to buy a large quantity of them simply serves to drive the price upwards until even the wealthiest will not be able to afford it.

One of the main differences between Electrum and bitcoin-QT is that bitcoin-QT actually downloads the whole blockchain to your computer (many Gigbytes) so that it can directly verify each transaction. This can take hours or days. Electrum, instead, relies on a group of servers to download and maintain the blockchain, so getting started with Electrum takes &lt; 1 minute. Theoretically, one or more of the servers Electrum depends on could be deliberately tampered with to give your Electrum client a "fake" view of the blockchain making you think transactions exist that didn't or vice versa which is why Electrum is considered less secure. Any of the "lite" clients work the same way. You can always set up and run your own electrum server if you were ultra-paranoid about this happening.

You know it might be interesting to try this in an alt-coin first to see how it goes. This made me think of something else you could control this way: the block "reward" amount.
One might think the incentive would be to vote for an ever larger reward each time, but if the miners did that the currency gets inflated to hell so it's actually not in their interest to do that. Basically, they could vote for more or less block reward/inflation based on demand they see for use of the coin... would be an interesting experiment but maybe not one to try in the main blockchain.

The benefit is that it is "difficult" to solve a block. The level of difficulty is adjusted over time by the network to insure that sufficient amount of work has to be done to create a new block. If this was not the case, than anyone could willy-nilly create a block and ask for it to be added to the block chain. The network of peers would have no objective criteria to screen out the block and so the block chain would grow at an uncontrolled rate. So, the benefit is that the integrity of the block chain is protected because only valid blocks containing valid transactions will be added and they are added at a controlled/predictable rate.

If your transaction got included in a block that forked off the main chain, then when that fork is abandoned your transaction should be incorporated into one of the next few blocks in the main chain.
How quickly it gets incorporated is, as always, dependent on its priority and the # of other transactions being processed.
@_date: 2013-02-27 21:48:02
Correct. You are immediately ranked with a higher priority from the miner's perspective. They also take into account the age of your inputs, the point being to prevent repetitive "spam-like" transactions. Unfortunately satoshi-dice is very very spam like.

If everyone tried to sell their bitcoins at the same time the price would drop to zero.
If everyone tried to spend all their government fiat on bitcoins at the same time, the price would go through the roof.
Consequently there is no easy way to calculate what they are worth because that requires speculating on people's future behavior in the market place.

Unless my math is wrong for the series 1 v1 minikey that's:
22 characters (base 58) = 22^58 combinations = 6.24*10^38

I disagree. A good currency should encourage saving, pragmatic spending and responsible investment (not loans) made by these same savers.
Currencies that depreciate via inflation on the other hand tend to encourage poor spending behaviour and excessive consumerism. They also encourage malinvestment since borrowers know they can routinely borrow money (that banks generate on demand) and later default on their debts and clean the slate with little consequence through the bankruptcy process.

I think anything that bridges the gap between a merchant and Bitcoin is useful, no matter what it is.
For example, consider if a merchant supports gift cards and starts to notice (assuming the data is available) that some large and growing percentage of these gift cards are purchased through Gyft and some growing percentage of these Gyft purchased cards are being bought with bitcoins? Eventually, given enough sales volume they may consider cutting out the middlemen (two in this case: Gyft and Bitpay).
For those smaller merchants though, it doesn't matter where the money comes from - they can sell their product, and Bitcoin owners can buy their product. Everyone wins! I think we'll continue to see increasing integrations at the point of sale for specific merchant segments, whether that be through gift cards, Bitcoin backed debit cards or just native integrations with the existing POS software. Case in point:

Actually... shorting BTC is MUCH simpler than that.
Just go to  and take out as big of a BTC loan as you can get. Immediately cash out the loan into government fiat. When a loan payment comes due, buy BTC with your fiat and make a payment. If the price collapses you'll be able to buy back BTC for cheap in a month or two. If it continues to skyrocket then pay up with huge losses on your behalf in fiat.
@_date: 2013-03-01 13:18:25
That's not a half-bad idea and this sort of thing has been done before (when for example coinbase enlisted a miner to help clear some long standing unconfirmed txns that were holding up a whole chain of subsequent txns).
The only problem I see is that there is no way to guaranty how quickly you'll be able to find the block - you only increase the probability by using more hashing power.
[edit] It would also be really nice to start building in a display of estimated fee -&gt; time to process forecast into bitcoin clients so that people could be informed upfront about what kind of fee they should use in the first place. What fee to use is black magic to most new bitcoin users.

I think you misunderstand the role of traders. They take *risks* so that others don't have to. Ask a farmer who enters into a future contract to lock in the sale price of his corn - he doesn't want the risk. A trader will take that risk in a heartbeat. We need these people just as much as we need merchants to sell product and customers to buy it. We need risk takers.

Yup they are down. Part of the "not investing more than you can afford to lose" concept is a recognition of the security and technological challenges just to store and handle large quantities of bitcoin safely.

Apparently you don't understand the concept of a "decentralized exchange". Bitcoin is typically traded for cash in person (  ) or cash in the mail is also a popular option (  ). The money never HAS to touch a "government registered" bank account, and even if it does (when doing a bank deposit trade) how can you tell who made the cash deposit? It could be the owner of the bank account for all we know.

Name a better alternative? Dollars and Euros are both deeply flawed currencies. Also, the built in escrow, multi-sig features of Bitcoin, not to mention the ease of payment at a distance, make it ideal for international settlements.


Can't be inflated away, taxed away or otherwise seized by a kleptocratic government run amok.


It's much easier to build an exchange between different unregulated crypto-currencies then to deal with all the red tape involved in typical forex exchanges/bucket shops. Consider:  - I expect to see a lot more innovation here.


Many would consider a lack of regulation, or more specifically an inability to enforce regulations to be one of the key **benefits** of Bitcoin. Regardless of what you think, black markets are here to stay in various forms and are a key part of any economy.

The additional hashing power in your pool only reduces the variance which is a "good" thing - that's why people like the larger pools.
But yes, your second explanation is the correct one - doubling your pool's hashing rate both doubles your chances of finding a block in the near term, but also means you need to split the reward evenly among all participants (and now you have twice as many participants in terms of hashing power).

You can use any of the addresses. You can also generate as many more addresses as you would like. The problem with a single address is that any person paying you at that address could also review all other transactions going to that address using blockchain.info for example.

The value of bitcoins is not infinite nor will it ever be because there is never infinite demand.
However, if what you really were asking is "Can the price of bitcoins increase in USD, EUR or (government currency of your choice here) indefinitely?", then the answer is that depends on the government/central bank issuing the currency and how much they decide to print/devalue their own currency because it will continue to increase as long as they do.
If the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank go the way of the Zimbabwe Central Bank and print nearly unlimited amounts of new government currency then the same applies to the price of Bitcoin in that government currency.

With Bitcoin there is no way to tell the difference.
@_date: 2013-02-20 16:42:16
On the opposite side, if the market rate of exchange was greater than that offered by the custodian, say 20,000 Bitcoin for 30 ounces of Gold, then the guy with 20,000 Bitcoin would buy his/her gold from someone other than the custodian. The only case where he'd trade his Bitcoin with the custodian is if the custodian was offering the Gold exactly at or below the market rate.
That means the custodian is merely another Gold trader, much like coinabul and provides no additional value to the market other than liquidity and competition for existing Gold traders.

Coinbase does not support limit orders. However, you can use their API to programmatically buy or sell some at a certain price level.

That's the beauty of Bitcoin. I don't need to trust anyone's rationality. All I need to trust is the integrity of the software they wrote and the protocol it implements, software that is fully open to examination and modification. 
If you use the internet then you are also choosing to depend on similar software written by people you know nothing about. If you think that's insane then maybe you should avoid the internet and go back to reading paper books by candle light while using your state mandated currency which has lost 98%+ of it's value over the last 100 years under the careful stewardship of government institutions.
Now *that's* insane IMHO.

You could look at the other side of that coin. Maybe people have been lax with security because they could always fall back on certain organizations to save their bacon when, say, their bank account gets hacked (the Bank, FED, FDIC etc..).
Bitcoin could be a benefit because people will finally be confronted with the reality of how crappy and insecure their (typically Windows) desktop environment really is. I see a whole generation of people emerging who will have learned to be much better at securing their own data and who choose open source software and operating system based primarily on their learned security experience.

It's sits in the pile with all the other unconfirmed txns until it rises close enough to the top (in terms of priority) to be scooped up and included in a block:

This is a low priority transaction.
size: 1124 bytes
priority: 528,443

One way you could accomplish the "hard fork" smoothly is to make any code changes to increase the block size go into affect in the future (say a year out from when the new version of the client is distributed). That way, everyone would have plenty of time to upgrade their bitcoin client software, minimizing any potential disruption.
Without an increase in block size we will likely see transactions taking longer and longer to process and/or fees increasing in order to guaranty transactions are processed in a timely manner. Perhaps that is not bad though?

They offer deposit/withdrawal through ATMS (free of charge if you use the ones you can find via their locator). All they are offering is essentially checking/savings accounts but the difference is that they are a Bitcoin friendly institution. The founders are from the internet archive (the organization that started paying their employees partially with Bitcoiin recently). That means they will be far less likely to close your account arbitrarily just because you are running a Bitcoin business (unlike a Chase, Bank of America etc...).
The point is you can open accounts at this credit union and then use these accounts in conjunction with other service providers (Bitpay, Coinbase etc...) to run your Bitcoin business and be happy. :-)

There are two ways to withdraw money, as CNY or BTC. It would be interesting to know how many people will choose one way vs the other, but that is what will affect price. If most want to withdraw as BTC and stlll need to covert then the price will go up. If most want to withdraw as CNY and need to convert back from BTC then the price will go down.
Edit: But with no new CNY flowing into the exchange (only out), one would have to assume that volume (though not the price) will slowly die off to zero.

Third party applications is for stuff like the coinbase mobile app so that doesn't matter.
The key factor is the API key being "Enabled" which allows any application/script with that key to access your account.  Definitely disable the API key if you weren't using it. I don't think it would have been enabled by default.
Another possibility is someone gained remote access to a desktop where you were already always logged in (bypassing 2-factor) and enabled the key or just manually did the withdrawal from there.

This is in stark contrast to today where it's relatively easy for any business idea, no matter how lame-brained, to get bank funding. For example, there have been 5 frozen-yogurt shops opened up within one mile of my house within the last couple years. It is readily apparent that the owners of these places did minimal market research or they would have realized that this small suburban market cannot sustain 5 frozen-yogurt shops. A couple of these have already gone out of business and I expect only one will likely remain in the end.
Crowd sourced funding would eliminate this situation because people living here realize they only need one frozen-yogurt shop and therefore would only fund the first one and not the second.

No, I think I understand you well enough.
In fact, you could make the case (and people have) that Bitcoin itself was started as a "shadow government operation" by the shadowy pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto if you wanted to go all conspiratorial.
Also, there is absolutely no "legitimacy" to Bitcoin itself. Participants in the Bitcoin economy are only here on a voluntary basis and would leave in a heart-beat if they felt that the currency and rules behind it were not anything but transparent.
So how do you "lure miners away" from what is already an entirely open, transparent and voluntary currency system? You would have to make a competing system that is even more superior and at least equally open and transparent. If it is superior, then the market will decide to use it - that is freedom of choice and I fail to see how that would ever be a bad thing.
Sure, I like Bitcoin today - but if something better comes along I will use that instead as will everyone else.

If you've never had your bank account frozen or seized (Cyprus) tried to send money to someone over seas and paid ridiculous fees (Western Union) or watched your government issued currency rapidly lose value (Argentina) while capital controls are in place preventing you from converting it to something else, then you probably won't see much value in Bitcoin.
But if you ever have to deal with any of these situations you will immediately understand why it's valuable.

I think standardization of how to refer to and pronounce different amounts of Bitcoin will emerge over time. Just do what feels natural to you!
However, if you'd like a starting point you could try the following suggestions:
mBTC = Milli-Bitcoins (I like to say Milli-Bits for short)
So I would verbally refer to 0.25 BTC as "250 Milli-Bits".
Another possibility if you look at the table is to call that 25 Centi-Bitcoins (or Centi-Bits)!

Please please please stop using Bitcoin QT and use a deterministic wallet like Electrum. With Electrum there is a 12 word seed to write down and no other form of a backup is required. All addresses including change addresses are generated in sequence from that seed.
You can even install electrum on two computers and if you use the same seed, they will be kept perfectly in sync.

I admire your sentiment. However, the full source code of this application has also been made available for review (open source):
Still, the pre-compiled version of the app available for download could have been tampered with to include a backdoor/spy-ware.
So, if you want to take the safest route you could download the source code and either examine it yourself or have someone knowledgeable you trust review it to make sure there is no backdoor hiding in the source. When satisfied that there isn't, you could then also compile it yourself using compiler tools you should be able to download.

The reward amount is actually 25 bitcoins + whatever fees were paid for transactions to be included in the block. The reward used to be 50 but was cut in half last year. There is one transaction in every block with no inputs (Newly Generated Coins). See this txn for example:
As for where the information is of who is connected to the Bitcoin network, it is with each of the peers in the network. So, for example with the txn shown above, the IP address is just the one from which the block was relayed. But that doesn't guaranty it is the ultimate source as the block could have been relayed through multiple other peers/IPs first.
In any case, there is no central server only many many peers.

Of course earlier adopters, software technicians etc... were well aware of what a DDOS is and what it can do.

Insomuch as any transactions contained in blocks from the "non-winning" fork were undone (and thus funds were available to spend again elsewhere), yes.

He may indeed have coins in his wallet in which case the advice others are providing here is worth trying. Another possibility, if he was truly bitcoin savvy, would be that he stored larger amounts in a "cold wallet" or "paper wallet".
You would want to search his personal belongs, or check his safe if he had one searching for a piece of paper with a QR code on it. Here is an example one (it may not look exactly like this):
If you find one of these, make sure you do not share that QR code / private key with anyone, especially anyone online.

"It may take a few years for everyone to realize it, but there will come a point when the ever-increasing outflows of money from fiat money into untaxable, unseizable decentralized currency will reach a tipping point, and we’ll have a financial panic like the world has never seen. Frightened lawmakers and banks will try to stop people from cashing out, but that will just increase the panic. Those who don’t get out before the door closes will be in dire straits indeed. This is the ultimate bank run — the run on the world’s central banks, and who could possibly step in and restore order?"

Actually this is far more common than you might think. You'll find many instances of these no transaction blocks if you look back a ways in the block chain. Sometimes this is because two blocks are simply discovered very close together in time and sometimes it is because the miner is deliberately mining for a zero transaction block.  
The # of transactions a miner allows to be included in a block is a configurable property including configurable to zero. Yes, it's purely optional if your transaction, or any transaction besides the block reward, is included.
Some people think this is a problem (I am not one of them). More discussion here:

I don't think so. I think the vendors on SR are more than willing to accept a day or two of volatility in exchange for an ongoing anonymous stream of payments for their product. They'll just chalk it up to the cost of doing business.
Consider the alternative: risking arrest by accepting cash from customers in person, dealing with distribution issues and theft by intermediaries, needing to smuggle suitcases of cash across international borders etc... compared to those risks, the cost of Bitcoin volatility seems pretty tame.

They did not. More specifically, who is a money transmitter was and still is open to interpretation. FinCEN issued recent guidance that they believe entities exchanging government fiat (USD) for virtual currencies should be considered money transmitters. Before that, and at the time Mt. Gox opened the account, it was completely undefined in regulatory terms.
Even today, this guidance is just an interpretation of law by FinCEN; it would take a court case to determine whether their interpretation of the laws defining who is a money transmitter was correct. However, one should never underestimate the ability of governments to pass laws that are retroactively enforced.

Indeed possible. Back then miners popped in and out just to try out the early alpha/beta Bitcoin client and bitcoins at the time were valued pretty close to zero (sub-penny). The ones that lost interest soon after may have deleted their wallets or recycled their computers just as part of the normal upgrade cycle. This means many bitcoins have been lost, which is okay because it increases the value of the remaining bitcoins.

Keep in mind that forks in the block chain happen quite often (several times a week) specifically when two miners discover a viable next block at almost the same time and are both able to distribute their block to a sizable share of the network. However, these forks usually resolve after a single additional block (the next) is found. This then resolves which fork is going to become the main chain.
The last instance of this (before the big fork) was block 224912:
The reason that this fork lasted longer than usual is that some large group of miners had upgraded to 0.8 and another large group of miners had not. The problem was that the new block chain created by the 0.8 miners could not be handled by the 0.7 miners due to a previously unexposed bug - so the 0.7 miners had no choice but to continue building the chain on their side of the fork or stop mining altogether until/unless they upgraded. This meant there was a large enough contingent on both sides of the fork to keep both chains going for quite a while (similar to a 51% attack).
Either way, it was in the interests of all miners involved to resolve the fork quickly. The 0.8 miners could certainly have refused to go back to mining the 0.7 side of the fork and they could have kept the fork going much longer until the other side (the 0.7 miners) capitulated. I guess you'd call that a "Fork War!" - Fortunately the miners seem to be on good terms especially when their profits are threatened. War was averted. :-)

Outbound sends from coinbase can sometimes take hours (personal experience) to actually show up as an unconfirmed transaction. This is why coinbase is terrible as a wallet.

One simple low cost way to "launder" bitcoin funds free of charge is to send your funds to an exchange and let it sit there a while. Then just withdraw the funds to a different address. Many exchanges use a different wallet/set of addresses to pay outbound withdrawals than they use for accepting inbound deposits. This will naturally mix your funds in with others who are trading on the exchange and there are usually no fees involved either.
Of course you run the risk of the exchange shutting down or having your funds stolen while they are there but that's true for all participants - just a risk of doing privacy on the cheap in your case. ;-)

Taking this further (and why others are referring to your scheme as nonsensical), let's say the market rate of exchange between Bitcoin and Gold was actually 20,000 bitcoin for 10 ounces of gold:
"The custodians would then turn around and sell the coins just received at market price and buy new gold again."
So your custodian just bought 20,000 bitcoin for 20 ounces of gold and must now buy back gold at market price according to your scheme so they buy 10 ounces of gold (maybe from the same guy they just sold gold to!). So in effect they just gave away 10 ounces of "free gold" to that guy. That's a game I can play all day (if I was that guy) and would soon bankrupt the custodian.
Incidentally, this is exactly the kind of activity that caused the U.S. to leave the gold standard when France, under the administration of the French President Charles de Gaulle started trading their U.S. dollar reserves for Gold at the "above market" rate the U.S. government was offering.

Vessenes said better customer service would be a priority. Right now, there's "a bunch of pain points for signup" to Mt. Gox, he told us. Vessenes believes that being an American company will make it easier to smooth over those rough edges.
And in his view, that's particularly important for wealthy individuals who want to purchase and store large quantities of bitcoins. **Vessenes says he's had multiple inquiries from people who want to "buy six or seven figures" worth of bitcoins**. Not only is acquiring that many bitcoins a hassle under the current system, but someone wanting to put serious money into Bitcoin would have to invest in technical infrastructure to properly encrypt and backup their wallets.

2. DDOS someone elses pool and thus keep the difficulty down so you can make more money with the pool you are mining in.
3. Sell a lot of BTC right before DDOSing the exchange to destroy liquidity/confidence. Then buy back BTC after the price drops. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.

In general, the risk in lending Bitcoin is far greater than the risk you take lending in traditional depreciating government fiat. This is due to both the exchange rate volatility and deflationary characteristics built into the Bitcoin money supply.
So, I would recommend against making any loans in Bitcoin unless you have a high tolerance for default risk. Instead, I would look at buying partial ownership/shares in some Bitcoin related venture and taking a more entrepreneurial stance where there is a reasonable chance of ROI.

This is what coinbase is up against:


While coinbase could stand to significantly improve in the customer support/service department, their fraud detection has to understandably be *very* tight. Just think what doing a million dollars a month in transactions means if any meaningful percentage of those transactions were to be reversed within the next 2 months.

@_date: 2013-03-02 23:08:24
That is true - I think this issue could be better addressed at the client level for example by:
1. Requiring you to register and identify (label) a bitcoin address with a human readable description before you can actually send funds to that address ("College Savings Fund", "Rainy Day Jar", etc... ).
2. Always having an "Are you sure?" dialog after hitting the "Send" button that summarizes all the payment details along with the label you added for the address.
But, the bitcoin protocol itself should remain tamper proof.

Well, the first thing you should know is that mining Bitcoin is not nearly as easy as the Business Insider article lead on. Sure, you used to be able to do it with a desktop PC years ago and more recently using your graphics card, but these days you need highly specialized hardware (referred to as ASICs) to earn more than a few pennies worth of Bitcoin at a time.
The best way to learn about Bitcoin is to actually buy a small amount and use it to purchase something on the internet. There is a small but growing ecosystem of merchants that accept this currency. By patronizing these merchants and exploring the online economy you will start to see more clearly how Bitcoin works, how it is being used today and how it might evolve in the future. Also you will, by necessity, need to investigate your options for wallet software in order to store your bitcoins. You have several choices  (I personally like Electrum as a very easy to use light-weight wallet with minimum disk storage requirements).
Another way to start looking at Bitcoin is to watch transactions occuring in realtime. Check out this site for a fascinating live view plus tons of stats

It's perfectly fine to hobby mine as long as you accept the fact that you will be spending more for your electricity than you are acquiring in bitcoins. 
In other words, it would be cheaper to just buy the bitcoins if your goal is to acquire some. Now if you have "free" electricity (because you are ripping off your landlord, your parents or your college or have a huge solar array), then sure mining will be "profitable". It may still not be profitable enough to recover your up front capital costs in a reasonable time frame (purchasing the GPUs, solar arrays etc...).

Just keep in mind, because I know we've all been brainwashed on this since childhood, that there is **no free lunch interest-wise** when it comes to Bitcoin.
Sure, you can put government fiat in a bank account to earn some pittance of interest and we've come to "expect" that interest. But this interest is actually an illusion because meanwhile the purchasing power of your money always erodes faster than your bank balance increases due to government sanctioned money printing/debasing.
Now with Bitcoin you can just let it sit there in the blockchain earning no interest, and yet your purchasing power will continue to appreciate over time due to the built in effects of deflation. Now can you take your bitcoins, invest them and end up with more bitcoins in return? Sure!
You also run a **significant risk of being scammed** and losing all the bitcoins you "invest". This has happened time and time again. So if you want to risk losing all your bitcoins for a little ROI, then have fun but don't say you weren't warned. Go in with your eyes wide open:

The blockchain manifests as a single file or set of files stored on individual's hard drives. Thus if it contains illegal content, then each individual hosting these files is personally responsible for possession of that content, which may be illegal.
One workaround would be to develop tools that strip/censor illegal content and can be applied to individual's copies on demand.

Single block forks (the equivalent of 1 confirmation) happen in the chain quite frequently due to multiple miners discovering valid blocks nearly simultaneously and propagating them to the network. More than single block forks are far less likely but not impossible, especially if there are network or country-wide firewall issues disrupting broadcast of blocks.
The most recent "big fork" due to the bug in bitcoind 0.7 resulted in a 24 block alternative chain being built before the fork was resolved.
In this case, even requiring 6 block confirmations would not have prevented a potential double spend but this would (we hope) be a highly unusual and unlikely occurrence under normal conditions.

Collisions in and of themselves are not proof of anything (for example you could be deliberately colliding with your own wallet addresses).
However, your algorithm is quite simple and anyone attempting to reproduce your results should be able to easily follow this:
Start with a Private key: 5JSTpckYPqsPRxrkV3zZzVKMJFNGfVu9JWX721QXTMb5Wr82mSf
Hex: 5224af20889ac590f79ca68588689d873ef60b206b33da6025ace0c90705c0b8
Int val of hex: 37154468760874988449110293609706090360941268111629659303434866284112583704760
Add and subtract 100000000 to that last int, generate the private key and then address for each of those and test against a dump of all address with balances from a bitcoind.
If you find any collisions, feel free to take their balances. I expect you will not find anything, unless the Op deliberately put something there for you to find.
Then start with a totally different private key, look at all the private keys generated up to +/- 100000000 and again you will not find anything. Rinse and repeat. Enjoy!

* Note that current Ask on Mt. Gox = $88.99 (10 BTC)
* On Mt. Gox purchase 10 BTC (at ask price) and at the same time sell 10 BTC on Bitfloor (at bid price).
* Capture the price difference ($93.58 - $88.99) x 10 = $45.90

Not necessarily. The price should eventually level off as we reach sufficiently broad market penetration (in a classic S-curve adoption model) or it could crash if something better comes along. There are no guarantees.


This is already handled by existing payment processors who absorb the exchange rate risk and allow merchants to convert an arbitrary percentage (0-100%) of their sales into their local currency (   ).

According to the source code it looks like a hash of your password is used along with AES encryption to secure the wallet. 
Note the pw_encode() and pw_decode() methods.
So I would say, yeah it's pretty secure. Of course, you can always just delete your wallet entirely (assuming you've written the 12 word seed on a sheet of paper) and recover it later from the seed, although that is obviously less convenient for day to day use. For large amounts that could be a pretty decent cold storage strategy though.

Doing the math, if the network was finding blocks at the one per 10 minute rate/average before you lost 80% of the miners and let's say you were half of the way to the next 2016th block where difficulty is recomputed (1008 blocks away), then here is how long it would take to get to the next difficulty adjustment.
100% of miners would take 1008 / 6 = 168 hours to get to the next difficulty adjustment so 20% (remaining) of miners should take 5 times as long = 840 hours (35 days). So, you'd have a little over a month before the difficulty adjusted to resume the 1 block per 10 minute rate. Until then, you'd be generating one block every 50 minutes on average.

They can't be destroyed because they are just an entry in a ledger at a specific address. However, if you lose the private key to that address then they are as good as destroyed since they can never be spent again.
Another way to "destroy" (make unspendable) bitcoins is to send them to addresses where no one could possibly be holding the private key. Case in point:

Certainly although hopefully it is self evident:
**Distribution** - In this phase Bitcoin starts out virtually unknown. The Bitcoin network is primarily composed of miners, cryptographers, hackers, political discontents and other early adopters intent on acquiring and experimenting with a new currency. It is characterized by a rapid creation rate (Block rewards of 50, then 25 etc...) and more than half of all coins that will ever be created are brought into existence and distributed (aka spent out) at absurdly low prices (Example: 10000 BTC Pizza). No one knows exactly what bitcoins will be useful for yet.
**Application** - In this phase the utility of Bitcoin has become clearer. The early adopters give way to innovators who are intent on using Bitcoin to enable their pet project/idea. A growing number of businesses begin accepting Bitcoin as payment and/or provide much needed services to the rapidly expanding community of users. Investment money pours into startups built around Bitcoin and public awareness grows substantially. The price of Bitcoin in government fiat continues to skyrocket under severe deflation - early adopters become wealthy.
**Transaction** - At this point, the public is very aware of what Bitcoin is and uses it for routine transactions just as they use other forms of payment (perhaps Bitcoin will be as common-place as email is today). Deflation still exists but the rate has slowed substantially as has the price appreciation and volatility. This benefits the economy by insuring predictable stable prices for both buyers and sellers. It also benefits savers who store their wealth in Bitcoin.

Sorry you had to learn the hard way that making loans with bitcoins is a terrible terrible idea.
Instead of making loans, look for real investments such as shares in a startup company, mining equipment any number of things where you take an ownership stake and hope for ROI while accepting the risk of loss. This is, IMHO, the only way to invest bitcoins as traditional loans simply won't work, especially in this highly deflationary stage.

All transactions are time stamped on the block chain so presumably, as long as you couldn't be linked to transactions occurring after a certain date (when the law went into effect), you'd be in the clear.

You are starting with a bad premise, that loans (liabilities) are for some reason "necessary". I would suggest that is not the case. Instead, any new venture could be funded through investment from an individual's savings or through crowd-sourced funding. If no one wants to invest in the venture then it was probably not a good idea to start with.
We've been indoctrinated in a system where banks generate up "money" out of thin air to make loans, and thus many bad loans have been made leading to malinvestment and excessive economic growth causing more problems then it solves. Perhaps it's time to consider the alternative, a sustainable steady state system:

It's a nice idea, but the main problem with this approach is that it could be abused by larger miners who might use their resources to increase the block size against the wishes of the smaller miners which could lead to more centralization. This video shows why larger block sizes are a problem especially for smaller miners:
Edit: I suppose the smaller miners would band together to always vote back down the block size on every block they create (to offset the larger miner's advantage).

Right now the entire network of Bitcoin miners hash at about 3 Petahash/s (3x10^12 Hashes per second). If you applied all this mining equipment to discovering active wallets you would need to iterate through the entire space of seeds ( ~3.4x10^38 ) attempt to key stretch/hash the address and check if there is a balance at that address (and the first address might not even be used) it would take about 1.1x10^24 seconds to search the entire space = 3.6x10^18 years .

While that is true, you are referring to product offerings from individual companies that were out-marketed by competing companies.
In the case of Bitcoin I think any single company's marketing efforts would have a hard time competing with the massive crowd-sourced marketing originating from current participants in the Bitcoin community.

They've also contributed their time in order to work and acquire money in order to purchase those WoW rigs in the first place, and time to learn how to configure them to mine Bitcoins as well as paying their substantial electric bills which costs money. Also, some people have put considerable effort into building stores, exchange services and all sorts of other infrastructure to make Bitcoin more usable for everyone.


I've contributed my time (which is the only thing I truly own) and I've risked my money (earned through previous jobs which also required my time) to invest in Bitcoin which in aggregate with other investors/speculators provided the demand and is the *only* reason the price of Bitcoin increased. I've also contributed directly to some of the source code for Bitcoin clients (for example, I fixed a bug in Electrum last month) and I've contributed to other open source projects as well.
Bitcoin is still a risk of course, and my investment could drop to zero easily enough. But I won't be here whining about it if it does. Many of my other investments and ventures have failed or had very little return so I just try to learn from it and move on. I hope your luck will improve as well!

FWIW here is a survey that was done earlier this year. Assuming respondents were truthful it gives some notion of average amounts owned by active members of the Bitcoin community:
Of course this totally ignores casual users who got small amounts of bitcoins as tips or were handed a "free" casascius coin at Porcfest, stuck it in a drawer and promptly forgot about it.
What we do know is the amount people could own if bitcoins were evenly distributed to everyone in the world:
21 Million BTC divided by 7 Billion People = 0.003 BTC (300000 Satoshi) per person on the planet.
In reality it's a much smaller amount due to the (unknown) amount of bitcoins that have already been "lost".

I think you are not broadening your vision enough. You are only considering a single use case for Bitcoin, namely retail purchases on the high street. There are plenty of other use cases though:
* International Payments
* Savings Accounts
* Currency Trading
* Black Market (where Bitcoin got started)
Consider the following potential markets:

If you buy some now you are still an early adopter. Consider that there are approximately 2.4 Billion internet users (  ) and only 21 Million BTC that will ever exist which means &lt; 0.00875 BTC (875000 satoshi) available for each internet user.

Well presumably you could create an app in the appstore that, upon being purchased and opened, initiates a payment in a fixed amount of bitcoins to the purchaser's address of choice.
The only problem is that Amazon allows app users to get refunds for app purchases meaning you're open to being scammed as the app seller. The app buyer could just request a refund after receiving their payout.

I agree with you. Blockchain could fix their bug on iOS, but they probably have less motivation due to the lack of competitors on the platform. Another possibility is they are paranoid about making any changes whatsoever to their app with the risk of having the next version rejected by Apple. I do hope coinbase is able to get back on there but I guess we will see.

Yes, the first miner in the peer to peer network that receives your invalid transaction will simply drop it and never include it in a block.
If that miner was corrupt and had modified the source code to generate blocks that allowed invalid transactions, then every other miner would validate and instantly reject each invalid block they generated.
Basically there is a trust no one and verify everything philosophy applied to the block chain.
@_date: 2013-03-18 17:14:10
Well that is the challenge, to predict the future difficulty which depends on how many ASIC units are sold and put into operation.
In general, if your order was at the front of the line and you had already received and were operating such a unit, it would be very profitable at first but then the margin will shrink over time. If you are at the end of the line (for example by ordering right now), then by the time you received the unit (assuming you even received it) and put it into operation you will either have a much tighter profit margin or you might even find you are operating at a loss due to your electrical costs exceeding your mining returns in which case you'll have to stop mining unless you like throwing money away.
So just saying, it's a gamble - but some people like taking that risk!

So if someone takes your loan when 10 bitcoins is worth $1000 ($100 per bitcoin) and then has to pay that back + 3% (let's say 10.3 bitcoins).
Outcome  When the loan comes due price of bitcoin has gone to $200 per bitcoin so they actually owe you $2060 (you made 106% profit in fiat terms)
Outcome  When the loan comes due price of bitcoin has gone to $50 per bitcoin so they actually owe you $515 (you lost 48.5% in fiat terms)
Sounds like a highly risky loan-sharking or gambling strategy which doesn't make sense except for the delusional or criminal. Enjoy!

The price (and consequently market cap) will have to be much higher before profitable (sub-second) high frequency trading even becomes possible.
So you've got cause and effect backwards. It's not HFT that will drive price, but price (higher) will make possible HFT.
Of course, other kinds of trading can be done today (such as basic arbitrage):

Those are traders buying and selling 100s or 1000s of BTC. If there are more sellers the price goes down; more buyers and the price moves up.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is not just a currency; it is also an international payment system that competes directly with providers of other payment systems such as Western Union, a company with an $8+ Billion USD market cap.
If any sizable percentage of Western Union customers decided that they could pay smaller fees and be better served by exchanging Bitcoin instead, then we might be watching Western Union's stock price drop while Bitcoin's price continues to increase in order to absorb the growing customer base.

Centralized exchanges are doomed. You have a bunch of botnet operators sitting around who, with ASICs coming online, can no longer make enough money mining CPU/GPU on even the largest configurations.
I'm guessing that is why they've turned their attention to hacking and DDOSing the exchanges, mining pools &amp; other popular Bitcoin sites - either to steal BTC outright, demand ransom or manipulate the currency price, classic pump and dump over and over again. They are literally strangling the golden goose for a few spare BTC.

What you are talking about is called a "stop loss" order - aka sell if the price falls to/below a certain price. Unfortunately bitfloor does not provide a way to do this through the UI, but you could easily write a script to execute such a trade via their API.
The script would need to periodically poll for the market price and if it falls below the price you've set, execute a market sell order to dump as much BTC as you want. If you'd like I can write that script for you - price would be 0.5 BTC

Yes, that is the only reasonable explanation. Since you had a very secure password that must have been taken as well by a keylogger.
Is the machine with the wallet software yours or owned by your place of employment. Did someone else have physical access to the machine or administrative access so that they could have installed such keylogging software? A malicious system administrator is always a possibility in that case.

Yes, this would be problematic for any bank trying to do so with bitcoins, because unlike government fiat there is no lender of last resort to "lend" new money into existence to back the bank when a bank run inevitably happens.

It depends what your goals are for buying bitcoins. Will you be spending your bitcoins immediately or holding them as an investment? How frequently will you be aquiring them and how soon will you need access to them (coinbase takes several days at least to get you your coins).  How anonymous do you want to be (coinbase links your purchase to your bank account)?
Coinbase is okay as a wallet but it's still a "third party" holding your money. The power of Bitcoin is that you can transfer bitcoins to your own personal wallet that only you control. If you want to try a nice light-weight wallet without having to spend many hours synchronizing, get electrum:
It's easy to use and backing up your wallet (in case of disk crash) is as simple as writing a few words on a sheet of paper (seed phrase) or memorizing them.

Exactly. The extreme rate of deflation and consequent growth in purchasing power will not last forever. However, while it does exist it serves the purpose of drawing in wider interest leading to broader distribution. And that is just as it should be:
Also, as the price rises some people are naturally incentivized to spend their bitcoins because of the inherent risk that the price could fall again. Again, this serves to distribute bitcoins even more widely to other people who are selling goods, priming the pump of the new digital economy. It's quite brilliant actually.

Pretty nice. You obviously have some code generation technique for your kiosk that doesn't require internet connectivity. Are you worried about the scenario where this code generation technique is discovered or reverse engineered and used to rip off either the kiosks or your website?
I see that your website prevents "double spends" by not allowing a kiosk generated code to be used more than once. However, for the code you generated from the website for withdrawing cash, if there were multiple kiosks deployed how would you prevent that code from being used multiple times to withdraw cash (once per kiosk) without the ability to communicate or coordinate between the kiosks?

Exactly. You can short directly by taking a loan on  immediately converting it to government fiat and then paying back the loan over time (speculating that the price will drop). Of course, if there is no prepayment penalty you can close your short position by repaying the loan in full at any time.
Alternatively, you can short indirectly by betting on the correct side of certain contracts (although these are thinly traded markets so far):

Well that's true, but the difference with USD is that people are forced to use the inflating money because it's required legal tender to pay taxes. With alt-coins, users can just abandon it if it inflates too much.

Simple answer: Bitcoin will not allow you to have a mortgage.
Instead you will have to use savings/layaway which steadily appreciates in value due to deflation until you can purchase a home outright, or another possibility is a rent-to-own arrangement allowing you to move in today.
If you wish to raise money for a business venture then you can raise it through crowd-sourced funding by convincing others of the value of your business idea and/or offering them a share in the business in exchange for their investment. Businesses that no one wants will not be funded.
Will there be wars if they have to be crowd-source funded? Unlikely. Thank you Bitcoin.

However, expect extremely high rates of default either from scammers who just want to walk off with the money or those who truly are unable to repay due to the values of their loans doubling/tripling overnight from currency volatility. Loans in BTC at this time are more akin to "loan sharking" that is, extremely risky for both the lender and borrower.
When the volatility smooths out loans in BTC will still be unappealing due to the built-in currency deflation. If inflationary fiat went away, then loans will likely go away as well or at least be much less common.

Bitcoin is a deflating currency by nature. You don't need to "earn money with your money" (interest) if it is constantly gaining in value (aka purchasing power). You merely need to save enough to cover your expenses and your expenses in the deflating currency should continue dropping each year.


And this is why Bitcoin is so radical. It turns the notion of interest, and especially "risk free" interest, the illusion the existing system has been desperately trying to preserve, on it's head.

"So my question is once the coins have all been mined how will we gain more coins?"
Short answer is, we won't gain more coins. However, existing Bitcoin value will continue to circulate and be exchanged for other currencies, commodities, products or your time. Also, Bitcoins are divisible to 8 decimal places; the smallest unit = 0.00000001 is referred to as 1 Satoshi.
With a world population of 7 Billion people, that would allow there to be approximately 300,000 Satoshi for each person, assuming they are evenly distributed.
So, as more people start to use them, they will likely use ever smaller quantities of Bitcoin in order to purchase things forcing the prices of everything to drop in terms of Bitcoin - that is what deflation looks like (the opposite of inflation). That also means that a salary paid in Bitcoin would continually need to be adjusted downward over time to deliver the same purchasing power.

But, a good rule of thumb for hoarders is to pick some small percentage of your newly acquired coin to spend. Whether it's to be generous to others or just to pay for every day things you would have gotten anyway, or even to buy your groceries ( see recent postings on for how to do that ), go ahead and do it!

If the Bitcoin miners/transaction verifiers would prefer the continued uncertainty and volatility caused by lost coins then I agree with you, they don't **need** to adopt such changes and so it won't happen.
Here is my speculation though (and I admit I could be completely wrong). At some point in the future I believe bitcoins will become a lot less volatile on a daily basis (much smaller swings in price against other fiat currencies). Partly this will be because the market has a pretty solid understanding/measurement of how many bitcoins are actually in play. Let's say the market assumes only 5,000,000 BTC are active and the rest that haven't moved for 10+ years are considered "lost".
Suddenly, someone with access to 1,000,000 BTC (example: Satoshi) who hasn't touched their coins in these 10+ years starts trading them. I believe this could cause a market price shock because of the sudden awareness of the 20% increase in # of BTC "in play".
While such volatility may be par for the course today, I'm not sure market participants of the future (mostly average users, not speculators) would be as willing to accept that after years of the expectation of low volatility being met. Therefore, I believe market participants will eventually support a solution for mitigating the risk of this scenario happening that involves either destroying inactive coins or reclaiming them.
But you're right; we don't **need** such a solution.

Easy for Government to cook up a pretense to shut it down. For example:
Someone could easily broadcast one or a series of transactions containing meta-data that, when concatenated together, turns into illegal content such as child pornography.

That is a **very** dangerous feature... you may want to contact coinbase about what happened to you. It seems foolhardy to allow completion of a bitcoin address from the *entire space of available addresses*.
A safer (but still somewhat dangerous) implementation would restrict choices to addresses you had sent to before and an even safer approach would be to allow you to label addresses and then only support completion with the ones you labelled.
**Edit:** You are not a moron; coinbase is a moron for adding this "feature". Unfortunately, you were the first to get burned by it. I would report it as a bug and see if you can get a refund from them (as unlikely as that might be).

I actually prefer Electrum (  ), because backing up your wallet is as easy as writing a 12 word "secret phrase" on a sheet of paper. This secret phrase is used as a seed to generate every bitcoin address your wallet will ever use. That means you could delete the wallet software, then reinstall it somewhere else and recover your wallet/bitcoins only using that phrase.
But the absolute most secure (from hackers) way to store coins is to make an offline paper wallet.

I think you may have some mistaken notions. A large percentage of bitcoins are in private hands rather than being on exchanges. Also we've routinely seen exchanges become unavailable in the past (due to denial of service attacks etc...) or even shutdown (Example: bitfloor) with negligible effects on the currency itself. Read some of the history/back-story on exchanges and see for yourself.
There is also a significant cash trading business (peer-to-peer) done through sites like   and others. So if the centralized exchanges all crashed tomorrow or were regulated out of existence, we'd still have peer-to-peer trading to fall back on.

I just described how to short BTC in a separate thread but here it is again:
You go to  and take out as big of a BTC loan as you can get. Immediately cash out the loan into government fiat. When a loan payment comes due, buy BTC with your fiat and make a payment. If the price collapses you'll be able to buy back BTC for cheap in days or weeks. If it continues to skyrocket then pay up with huge losses on your behalf in fiat.
Example Scenario:
So, you could have just made a killing with this strategy due to the recent market tanking. Here's how it could have played out just in the last day:
* Yesterday you take out a 10 BTC Loan from BTCJam and sell for $USD at $250 per BTC = $2500
* Today, you buy back the 10.1 BTC (includes 1 day of interest) at the current price $140 per BTC = $1414.00 and then pay back the loan + interest.
* You pocket the difference ($2500 - $1414 = $1086 USD)
Now, if the price had shot up to $300 today instead and you decided to pay back the loan:
* You buy back 10.1 BTC @ $300 = $3030 USD
* You pay back the loan with a loss of ($3030 - $2500 = $530)
Or you could sit on your loan for more days and see what happens.

1. Market manipulation is usually accomplished through various forms of counterfeiting (Arbitrary money creation by central banks, rehypothecation of assets, naked short selling and other chicanery). Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited and value flow is far more transparent than other markets (all transactions are public and reviewable via the blockchain). Also it is exceedingly difficult to naked short Bitcoin since you can't create more of it out of thin air.
2. Well if he is, he must be doing it mighty slowly or the price wouldn't keep rising (supply clearly outpacing demand). A bigger risk would be someone willing to sell all their hoard at one shot - but that would not be in the seller's best interest usually due to slippage.

I completely agree with this statement. You could lose a lot!


While there is certainly a risk of this happening, for example if a catastrophic flaw is discovered in Bitcoin that makes it possible to "steal" all bitcoins, regardless of which addresses they are associated with making them literally worthless, short of that I don't think the value will ever go to zero. Why, you say?
Because there exists a radical loyal fan base of Bitcoin owners who are committed to holding theirs "forever" to the bitter end. So, the more likely outcome is that you will always be able to sell your bitcoins even if it is for a few pennies each (*nearly* zero), just because these radical folks exist.
Edit: Keep in mind that some of these radical folks actually bought their coins when they were pennies or &lt; $1 so it would be no major loss to them from where they started.

In this scenario, you could use an escrow service to hold the payment for the car. The dealer could verify that funds are present and then release the car and title to you and list the payment address on the contract you signed for it.  You could then inform the escrow service to release funds to the dealer at that address.
If the dealer presented you with a fraudulent payment address on the contract, that would be their liability alone.

There is no single blockchain server. The blockchain is a distributed file with a copy on everyone's computer that is running the reference bitcoin client. There are likely 100s of thousands of copies of it if not more. It is just like a torrent meaning if you want to stop it you would have to delete every single copy of the blockchain on earth to get rid of it entirely, a nearly impossible task.
Also, if the current developers were put in jail, another group of developers would just take the source code (which is free for all to download and distribute) and work on it in a different country or in secret.

What I meant is that every address is public, even the so-called "private" address you sent all your mix funds to.
The only difference is that there **may** be no linkage between your identity and that private address (unless the mixing service harvested identity information from you). Anyone in the world can still see the funds at your "private" address simply by examining the block-chain.

Another scenario I've contemplated is the "doomsday" scenario. Let's say that the power grids are knocked offline worldwide but there is a single resourceful miner who had the foresight to install solar arrays and is entirely off the grid. Ignoring the fact that the miner probably has more pressing issues (like feeding their family and fighting off the hoards of survivors), if they wanted to continue mining in isolation and let's say they were able to get their hands on an Avalon ASIC before the apocalypse with 60 GHash of compute (vs the current worldwide capacity of 36000 GHash -  ).
In this scenario the miner would be 1/600th of the world capacity of miners. So, continuing on their own it will take 600 times as long to find the next block on average = 6000 minutes or 4.167 days. With 1008 blocks to the next difficulty reset we are looking at 4200 days (11.5 years) at which point this single miner could resume the 10 minute rate. Of course, being on their own without anyone to check their work, they could easily change the rules long before then by recompiling their software. The problem would be if they tried to rejoin a network of surviving miners and remerge a block chain that had been fragmented by many different adhoc rules. This scenario is ridiculously absurd and unlikely of course since why would you be concerned about making digital payments if you are not interacting with the rest of the human race and there is no longer an Internet.

You could send your bitcoins to an exchange like btc-e (where you don't need to provide identifying information to open an account). Then withdraw to a different address (essentially using the exchange as a mixing service).
But otherwise (without using a third-party mixing service/exchange), there is not a way to unlink coins to your initial address. However, upgrades may be coming in the near future to make this all possible within the block chain itself:

So, you could have just made a killing with this strategy due to the market tanking. Here's how it could have played out just in the last day:
* Yesterday you take out a 10 BTC Loan from BTCJam and sell for $USD at $250 per BTC = $2500
* Today, you buy back the 10.1 BTC (includes 1 day of interest) at the current price $140 per BTC = $1414.00 and then pay back the loan + interest.
* You pocket the difference ($2500 - $1414 = $1086 USD)
Now, if the price had shot up to $300 today instead and you decided to pay back the loan:
* You buy back 10.1 BTC @ $300 = $3030 USD 
* You pay back the loan with a loss of ($3030 - $2500 = $530)
Or you could sit on your loan for more days and see what happens.

Apparently, building up savings that you can spend later is not good for the economy? 


Yes, you'll sit on your money until you die and never spend it. After all you don't need to buy food or pay rent or anything like that. Sorry, but your assertion doesn't pass the sniff test.


Inflation promotes excessive consumption and poorly planned growth for the sake of growth which leads to much waste and pollution. Deflation encourages careful consumption and a preference for purchasing items of quality that will last, leading to less waste.

It could allow exporting some of the price volatility away from the BTC/USD, BTC/EUR and other BTC/gov-fiat currency pairs as the more speculative market participants switch to swing trading and arbitraging BTC/Alt-coin pairs instead.
This is only a hypothesis, but BTC does appear slightly less volatile than it did in the spring bubble/run-up. Perhaps the alt-coins are acting as the "shock absorbers"?

It's not a problem because bitcoins can be arbitrarily subdivided, so lost coins simply drive up the value of the remaining coins in circulation.
The only downside is the uncertainty this creates around how many coins are lost forever or just being saved for a long time. Also, people dying and leaving behind hidden keys means the potential for many future treasure hunts.

I think you misunderstand Physical Bitcoins. They *are* backed by a real digital Bitcoin - aka a value in the block chain ledger.
For example, all Casascius Physical Bitcions have their bitcoin address in a published list:
You can then look up the address for any given coin and see whether or not it is funded with an actual Bitcoin transaction within the block chain ledger:
Or are you talking about "fake" Physical Bitcoins that are unbacked?
**Edit:** I see the Op changed his wording clarifying he was referring to unbacked "fake" Physical Bitcoins.

Did you access the linux box remotely (like through ssh or vnc) from another system? Your linux password and your wallet password could have been easily keylogged on that other system and then the attacker used that information to log in to your linux box as you, take your wallet and decrypt it. I would check your last log on the linux box for a source/IP address that is not familiar to you, although the attacker could also have gone through the same remote system that was already compromised.

As others have already pointed out you can certainly continue making loans in other currencies if you still want to. But, as long as Bitcoin is in hyperdeflationary mode it just doesn't make sense to be a lender or a borrower.
Also, your argument that loans are a good idea is premised on the notion of an ever expanding economy, because that is what is required for the loans to be paid back. But what if that premise was completely wrong? What if there were better more sustainable alternatives we should be considering?
Maybe loans aren't as necessary as you think they are for innovation.

Look, almost all software that you use infringes on multiple software patents. It's been that way for quite a while, certainly long before Bitcoin came along. Fortunately the tide is shifting in favor of abolishment:
Also, when it comes to practical enforcement of patents ("patent trolling"), those who would seek compensation tend to go after large targets with a lot of capital (i.e Fortune 100 companies). It is not cost effective to go after thousands of individual users which is why that doesn't happen. So there is little to fear as an end user.

Significant price fluctuations should not be surprising during the distribution phase of Bitcoin because the market is still trying to discover how useful (or not) Bitcoins are. This leads to wild speculation and price swings as people hoard and dishoard depending on how they are feeling about it today. This sort of thing should settle down as we move into the application phase where the utility of the currency becomes much better understood and knowledge is widespread. Eventually we get to the point where Bitcoin is treated like any other form of money used for transaction (= boring) with a very stable price (gently increasing due to deflation).

"If a neutral third party could guarantee a fixed exchange rate with for example gold no matter the price of a bitcoin it would function as a minimum price of the coins creating price stability in the lower end."
The whole idea is that Bitcoin is a DECENTRALIZED currency - trying to create some trusted 3rd party in order to "guarantee" the value of the coin is exactly contrary to this concept because it is an attempt to centralize control of the currency in a similar manner to a central bank. A central bank is supposed to be a "neutral third party", but we know in practice that it never works out that way.

The current system is already decentralized as there are many banks with many systems, each with a partial view of the entire world financial system (aka a subset of all accounts in existence).
Bitcoin is just a more transparent decentralized system = all accounts visible to everyone. Also, the bank systems worldwide likely consume far more power than Bitcoin miners do, at least for now. That could change.
Bitcoin was not designed to detect and unwind "fraud" - that is a social construct placed on top of the financial system by governments/regulatory regimes.

Here is the ONLY fair shot people have:
There will be at most 21 Million BTC available since that is all that will ever be created. If we equally divide that among everyone on the planet (about 7 Billion people), that gives us only 0.003 BTC per person (3 mBTC) which costs about $0.38 USD at this point in time.
That means, anyone who wants to can buy their "fair share" of Bitcoin today for a measly 38 cents. Anyone who has more than 38 cents worth of BTC today will be orders of magnitude wealthier in Bitcoin terms than those who did not tomorrow. That's just the simple math of it and I doubt anyone will agree to change it.

Just to put this in perspective, because I like numbers:
# Bitcoin Addresses created in order to result in a 50% probability of a single collision: 2.2 x 10^19
Earth's Human Population: 6,973,738,433 =~ 7 x 10^9
# Bitcoin Addresses Created Per Person = 2.2 x 10^19 / 7 x 10^9 = 3.14 x 10^9
Human Life Expectancy: 80 years
Human Life Expectancy in seconds: 2,524,608,000 = 2.5 x 10^9
Bitcoin Addresses needed to create 50% probability of a single collision =
3.14 x 10^9 / 2.5 x 10^9 =
1.25 Bitcoin Addresses per second per person alive today, over the course of 80 years, can be created resulting in the 50% chance that a **single** collision will occur.
Now you could configure a bunch of super computers to generate Bitcoin addresses much more rapidly than this potentially resulting in a collision sooner. I'll leave that calculation up to someone else though.

One thing you could do is if you have a credit card through a bank that you also have a checking account through check if they allow credit card payments as a direct withdrawal/transfer from the checking account (example: Wells Fargo supports this).
If they do, all you need to do is link your checking account to  and you can sell bitcoins resulting in an ACH deposit to your checking account whenever you need to make a credit card payment/transfer.

I agree with you on the unoriginality of these altcoins. However they do have something going for them, the perception of being relatively "cheap" compared with Bitcoin. That is worth a lot to the irrational human mind as can be seen with penny stock speculation.
Also, the infrastructure is already in place (bitpay etc...) that could be easily adjusted to support these altcoins as an alternate form of payment with zero-to-little impact to merchants. So, they can't be entirely ignored.

Indeed - since the software is open source anyone can make whatever changes they want to it. However, the trick is getting the majority of the network of miners (software users) to agree to use your modified version of the software.

The difference with bitcoins is that the owner of bitcoins has little or no incentive to "deposit" them with a 3rd party (bank) in exchange for a "bitcoin receipt". In fact the incentive runs in the opposite direction as you are accepting risk the 3rd party will go out of business or run away with your coins.
Sure, you may store some bitcoins at an exchange like MtGox for a short time in order to trade them, but the incentive will always be to encourage withdrawal as soon as possible because you can never fully trust a 3rd party. This will make fractional reserve impractical if not impossible.

It would seem paradoxical for a company to spend a great deal of effort to create their own proprietary cryptocurrency only to then have to give up control of it in order for their product to compete effectively with Bitcoin.

So what you're saying is that decades of game theory research is wrong and that market participants are not intelligent rational decision-makers, acting in their own interest? I think I'll side with game theory.


Are you aware how absurd that exercise would be? Imagine trying to spend even 10% of $16 Trillion dollars ( = U.S. GDP  ) in a short time frame. Prices would rapidly increase to meet your near instantaneous demand and then there's the red tape and lawsuits you would be slapped with along the way, plus retroactive taxes (governments love to pass retroactive taxes to counteract perceived "unfairness"). It would take years to unwind that mess.


That's correct. So now bankers are hoarding all this extra cash instead. And why are they doing that? Why not just dump it on the market like you say you would do and buy everything up? Oh right, there's that rational self-interest thing again.

They subsidize a lower price through several mechanisms depending on how reckless they were with their finances. Consider the prospective miner who has very little experience and money to start with but decides to buy mining equipment anyway because, in a starry eyed fit of madness, they "want in" on the action.
* Since they have little money to start with they buy the equipment on credit (either with credit card directly or cash advance)
* Upon receiving the equipment (typically months late) the miner start hashing and finds within a month that they've incurred a large electrical bill (often hundreds of dollars higher than before they started)
The miner is now under tremendous pressure to repay the debt they took out initially as well as pay for their increased electrical costs. Consequently they are likely to sell some or all of the bitcoins they just mined. This process in aggregate results in more bitcoins supplied to the marketplace than there otherwise would be, driving down their cost.

Even if &gt; 51% were malicious (following new rules) the remaining &lt; 49% would still continue to enforce the old rules. Creating a block that doesn't follow the rules causes a fork in the block chain. So you could potentially have two chains being built after the fork (new rules chain and old rules chain).
However, under normal conditions where &gt; 51% are following the existing rules the vast majority of peers will simply ignore any fork and continue building on the "main" chain that does follow the rules. 
Edit: There was a recent event demonstrating this where about half the network of peers had upgraded and, due to an unforseen incompatibility with the non-upgraded peers, a long lasting fork was created. Eventually, after 24 blocks, this fork was resolved.

Yes - that would be a much better solution! Create a "deferred" order where you specify qty and maximum acceptable price (limit order) and expiration time (default 1 hour).

You could take the seller to court for breach of contract. However, assuming the dispute was settled in your favor, it would likely be settled with a judgement against the baseball card seller for the government fiat value of the bitcoin (the judge might use the Mt. Gox price as guidance) + legal expenses. This is because only government fiat is legal tender for settlement of debts public or private. So, if the baseball card seller was unable to return the bitcoin itself, they would still be liable for returning the fiat value 
Of course it is then still up to you to collect on the debt/judgement.

Except, in the case of Bitcoin if the price were to level off it would still have value as a medium of exchange/remittance. All the bubble callers seem to ignore/overlook this fact. They assume that everyone is in Bitcoin just to ride the exchange rate up and convert back into government fiat at some point. There are those who just want to save it and use it for exchange too. As long as such people exist, Bitcoin will continue to have non-zero value.

This statement makes no sense. Of course there were individual persons who started accepting something in exchange for their valuables, something which also had value and was later referred to as money.
Here is a better answer to my question of "How did money get started?"
In fact the individual persons that make up the market place, which originally consisted of purely barter transactions, chose what constituted money and that choice was a rational choice (not one based on delusions). Items in the market that proved useful as money had the following characteristics:
* Items that were scarce (i.e. not blades of grass)
* Items that were divisible into smaller units
* Fungibility (one unit perceived as equivalent to another)
* A specific weight or measure or size can be verified/counted (unit of account)
* Store of value (does not deteriorate/rust over time)
Eventually market participants selected precious metals like Gold or Silver, since these were the items which best fit the characteristics of what we refer to as money. But we were still on a barter system - it's just that everyone was willing to barter for these precious metals now because they realized these items would be the easiest to later exchange for what they wanted. Later, we switched to pieces of paper which acted as receipts for precious metals, and more recently pieces of paper backed by nothing at all called Federal Reserve Notes (perhaps that is the delusion you were referring to?)
Here is a better explanation of the history of money and why Bitcoin is an even better form of money for our modern economy (compared to Gold or Federal Reserve Notes).

This digital "bitcoin balance" could also be thought of as a claim for bitcoins. But what value would holding a claim for bitcoins have over holding the bitcoins themselves? I would suggest there is none and in fact there is significant downside and risk since presumably the bank would be loaning out your bitcoins with no easy way to recover them due to their limited supply (unlike Dollars/Euro fiat where more can be printed up by the central bank).
So it's not so much that fractional reserve banking is impossible with Bitcoin, It is just more transparently revealed as what it always was, an unstable and risky scheme for all participants involved. As a holder of bitcoins I personally see no value in letting any third party manage those funds.

Unfortunately, that is not sufficient for a zero-trust decentralized currency like vanilla Bitcoin. So, until they crack that problem by coming up with an implementation that supports distributed multiparty generation of the factors and modulus, Zerocoin simply isn't ready for prime time.
Knowing the p,q factors allows anyone with that knowledge to double-spend zerocoins.

I believe they still have the hurdle of initializing the Zerocoin accumulators with known prime factors requiring trust (that the factors were deleted). In other words, Zerocoin is not fully zero-trust yet which is a fatal flaw. You have to trust the creators of it not to keep these factors which would allow them to spend your coins (if you have any).
But once they can generate the factors in a way that is zero trust it may have value being implemented in an alt-chain or even the main Bitcoin chain. Nothing wrong with innovation!

It's even worse than that. For example, someone could potentially tamper with the supposedly tamper proof hologram, access the private key and spend the Bitcoin value, then sell the apparently pristine physical coin to someone else:
You can always verify the address against the blockchain to see if it has been spent yet.
But considering these weaknesses, physical bitcoins should really only be kept for their numismatic interest and will not be that useful for everyday transactions.

There's already a solution - multi-signature transactions.
In the case of your perfectly locked house you could construct a lock that requires at least one private key from a pool of two or more private keys in order to unlock the house. The "user" of the house would have one of these private keys and then have a trusted third party (or multiple third parties) hold the other key(s) in escrow only to be used in case of emergency to recover access to the house.

In general, not locking in the rate of purchase allows this sort of thing to happen.

Miners can already blacklist/reject blocks originating from other miners. It's just not in their interest to do so since the rest of the network will likely accept the same blocks.
However, if it became well known that certain IPs were mining empty blocks consistently for the purposes of disrupting the network, you could expect a blacklist being created, distributed and used by a sufficient percentage of the network in order to repel the disruption attempt.

Hmm interesting; but if one or more miners decided to continue mining with 0.8, they could easily create another large block triggering the bug again for the 0.7 version miners (sabotage!).

There is nothing to combat. Basically blacklisted coins will be spent outside such regulatory regimes (or within the regime as part of a black market).

More specifically, if you initiated a bogus transaction that put, say, 1000 BTC in your bitcoin address and broadcast it to the network, everyone else including the miners of new blocks would quickly identify that the transaction does not follow the common rules as defined within their software and consequently your transaction would never be added into a block that is appended to the block chain (common ledger).
The same goes for blocks themselves, so if a miner created a bogus block giving themselves a 1000 BTC block reward for example, and broadcast it to the network, everyone else would reject that block for not following the common rules.

Check your math again. That's not nearly enough computing power:
1 + 40 + 40 Mkey/s = 81 Mkey/s * 61 = 4.941 Gkey/s = 4.941 * 10^9 key/s
4.941 * 10^9 key/s * 2.4678 * 10^9 s = 12.19 * 10^18 keys
You need 2.15 * 10^38 keys -&gt; addresses just for you.

The transaction verification is really only needed for high value transactions to guaranty they won't be reversed, especially from untrusted parties over the internet.
When dealing with a lower value transaction (i.e. the cost of a meal etc..) and with someone who is physically present, there is a much smaller risk they will attempt to defraud you by double spending to cancel out the first transaction they sent.
It would be like pretending to put cash on the table and then dashing out the door when no one is looking (dine and dash). Sure, it happens but not often.

You could also store the majority of funds in a single address and then split the private key for that address into two pieces using a scheme like this:
Then, you leave one of the pieces with trusted relatives (who can't use it yet), and one piece with the lawyer (who also can't use it). Then the lawyer is instructed to give the 2nd piece to whoever you specify (in your will etc...). The recipient can now combine both pieces and access the secret key/Bitcoin funds.

Well, no. Keep in mind that every bitcoin transfer from any address to any other address is public information since it is all part of the public/shared block chain. Anyone can see a list of real time transactions here:
Sample recent transaction:
The only thing that is unknown is the reason for a transfer from one address to another (does the same person control both addresses or was it a sale etc... reason for transfer is unknown). But the transfers always remain public info. Of course, how do we know who controls which address, especially since you can create an unlimited # of new addresses on the fly? This is why Bitcoin is referred to as pseudononymous, not truly anonymous.
If you want to stay more anonymous you should be buying your Bitcoin with cash from individuals so there is no electronic record whatsoever linking your bitcoin address to anything else (like a bank account) that can identify you. Another option is using mixing services that obscure further where funds came from.

Even a large botnet of computers (CPUs) would not have nearly the hashing power sufficient to compete with the specialized hardware used by Bitcoin miners today (FPGAs and now ASICs).
With regard to a wealthy interest ordering a large # of ASICs, that is indeed possible but there is currently a waiting list from the few vendors producing these (severe supply side issues). This will become less of a concern though as ASICs are eventually distributed to a large diverse group of individuals.

Since the Bitcoin clients are all open source, anyone who has the programming skills could add this feature in a branch and have it pulled into the main branch if it passed review. 
Edit: Of course a keylogger would make 2 passwords just as unsafe as a single password... need some more sophisticated way of deriving the second password like from a yubikey.

And you don't think the market will be smart enough to see through that ploy? I mean sure price runnups might happen once or twice or maybe several times with cryptocurrencies... but endlessly?
It has some similarity to the dotcom bubble - there were some truly innovative internet companies and lots of me-toos. Initially the market couldn't tell the difference but it got smarter over time and eventually the bubble burst. All that remained were companies providing some real value or an established network (first movers).

Yes, and that is actually part of the answer to your question. Basically, if you are a miner with significant hashing capability, it is in your own financial interest to use that power to brute-force look for new blocks, earning the block reward, rather than trying to search an exceedingly large space ( 2^256 ) for bitcoin address private keys. That, and it will take forever before you can find a single address key for a non-zero balance.
But please feel free to try it, if you want to see for yourself. There's even a program to help you do it.

I find it hard to apply the ambiguous wording of this interpretation of the law by FinCEN to what Bitcoin miners are doing.
For one thing, it refers to "A person" that creates units of virtual currency. However, no person is actually creating the currency. Rather, a person must set up and leave running a program which attempts to solve for new blocks to be added to the block chain. The person doesn't even need to be there once the program is started and left running.
There are many other parties at play in the process of "creating units of currency". There is the mining pool operator (person) running mining pool software that coordinates the work of thousands of individual mining programs towards solving the block. Also, the mining pool software is responsible for dividing up the reward for any discovered block and sending it to all pool participants, proportional to the work that was done.
Then there is the rest of the Bitcoin network which must validate and accept (or reject if invalid) all new blocks submitted by the mining pool operator software or individual mining software. If the block is invalid, then the reward disappears. That is, without the acceptance and participation of the ENTIRE network, no currency can be issued.
Finally, there is Satoshi Nakamoto, the original developer of the rules being followed by all software participating in the Bitcoin Network. Without his rules existing, no currency could be issued.
So tell me again, who is the one (A) person responsible for creating units of convertible virtual currency in this scenario?

All you have is the password to your private keys and the 5th amendment (you don't have to reveal the password to anyone). In the UK you don't even have that...
But a better question to ask is not what legal standing Bitcoin has, but rather how relevant such laws defining Bitcoin property rights would be when the government has no way of enforcing them? That is, if someone steals your private keys and uses them to steal your bitcoins, the government has no way of getting those bitcoins back for you anyway.
Now they could jail the thief (if you could discover who it was) under some of the more general laws against hacking/unauthorized access to computer systems but that doesn't help you much.
Edit: I suppose they could try to coerce the thief into give up their private keys in order to potentially recover the bitcoins, but then you have the 5th amendment working in the thief's favor.

This is a "somewhat" centralized approach. The key piece is near the bottom of the bitcointalk post:




So basically the seed used to generate all secrets is on (or close at hand) to the server used to reveal the secrets publicly (centralized). If that server gets shut down / destroyed or otherwise taken offline they are saying the backup strategy is to have 6 of the 10 trusted members come together and reconstruct the seed from pieces (using something like Shamir's Secret Sharing strategy):
Of course in a catastrophic scenario, the minimum 6 community members could be unavailable and then this strategy would fail as well.

2. Blockchain is just an accounting ledger in a file that everyone has a copy of. Perhaps you mean blockchain.info - that is just a website that shows you a "pretty" view of that ledger.
3. Yes - it fluctuates based on supply and demand - the supply is limited but the demand is currently growing so the price goes up. If the demand goes to zero the price goes to zero.

If an unconfirmed fee-less/low priority transaction is floating around (and there are quite a few that do  ), it is always possible to then submit a second transaction, including a miner fee, with the same address as input.
This second transaction, if processed first, will invalidate the first transaction you sent as a double spend meaning the first transaction will be dropped.

Similarly, it is estimated that Satoshi controls more than 1M BTC alone (a little less than 5% of all bitcoins that will ever be created). Will he ever spend/transfer these or not? Perhaps he has already lost or deleted the private keys. This kind of uncertainty casts a shroud over the long term stability of Bitcoin.
If enough people see this as a problem, perhaps there will be consensus to modify future versions of bitcoin to make either reclamation or certain destruction of any such old/unmoved coins possible, if only for the sake of a more stable market value. Or, maybe not!

I think you are correct about loans in the traditional sense. Who in their right mind would want to make or take a bitcoin denominated loan with the ongoing price volatility and severe deflation?
I would still see investment and business partnerships being a possibility though, where both the risk of failure and benefit of success is shared with those making the investment. But won't that naturally result in better investment decisions being made, vs. the current environment of nearly free-money/quantitative easing that leads to serious malinvestments and misallocation of funds?

"Who decides that it should go up, or down, or stay the same?"
The market decides - when anyone wants to trade their Bitcoin for something else, say US Dollars then the seller chooses at what price they are willing to let the Bitcoin go and the buyer chooses what price they are willing to pay. If the buyer and seller cannot agree on a price then a trade is not made. If they do agree then a trade is made. The "last" price is the price recorded for the most recent trade.
The US Dollar is also a 'fake' thing with no real value behind it other than what you can get trading it for something else. This introduction to Bitcoin might be more your speed:

Bitcoins are exceedingly rare. Look at this recent estimate of the # of total Internet Users:
These 2.4 Billion internet users are all potential Bitcoin users, just like they were potential Paypal, EBay and Facebook users a few years back. Since only 21 Million BTC will ever be created, if this amount were to be evenly distributed to these internet users that would amount to 0.00875 Bitcoin per user.
The reality is that the future average internet user will have access to far less than even 0.00875 BTC (875,000 satoshi) to transact with. So being an early adopter and putting even 1 BTC in your wallet sets you massively ahead of the future average internet user.

Most of your questions are addressed by basic human behavior / game theory:


There already are several implementations of the bitcoin protocol, one of the more popular ones used by miners is cgminer:  - anyone is free to branch this at will and make their own variant or start from scratch. Keep in mind that miners are incentivized to run the software version that will make them the most money, so they might not use a branch if they were concerned that it deviated in any way from the standard protocol that would cause them to either earn less money or lose money.


You can follow all their updates directly on source forge  or on  . I also like this animation of early work done on github  
The developers have a lot of power in terms of making suggestions but otherwise they are very limited. Miners will be most likely to go along with any suggestions that lead to earning them more money as well as preserving the credibility and value of any bitcoins they already hold. That is why they worked together quickly to resolve the blockchain forking issue - it truly was in everyone's self interest.


The source code is the best documentation - anyone is free to examine it, critique it or modify it.


Of course anything is possible - however if anything like that was tried it would almost certainly be noticed by other developers and be exposed since the software is open source. This would lead to significant credibility problems and abandonment of code changes that were perceived as disruptive to the long term value of bitcoins.


Are most people who hold and use US dollars aware of all the shenanigans that go on at the central bank? Some users are aware of the inner details and issues of Bitcoin and some are not. If the users perceive that a currency (like Bitcoin or US dollars or anything) is flawed, then they are free to abandon it and go use a different currency. Some obviously did last night because the price of bitcoins did drop quickly before recovering. AKA The market is working!

It may just be that there were more transactions than normal being processed at the time you submitted yours. There's only a certain amount of space in each block to store transactions and so, under heavier load, it may just take longer to be included. Looks like yours took 376 minutes.
If speed is more important to you then you could try a higher fee than $0.18 to get the miners to prioritize yours higher.

Assuming your computer's random number generator has not been corrupted you are dealing with 128 bits of entropy for the seed.
That's 2^128 = 3.4*10^38
So if you happen to have a lot of computer hardware, let's say the entire Bitcoin network ~7000 TH/s working on trying out every possible seed in parallel which involves hashing to determine the secret key for just the first bitcoin address in each deterministic wallet generated from the candidate seed and checking for a non-zero balance, how long would it take for us to look through half of all the possible wallets to have a 50% chance of finding yours?
3.4*10^38 / 2 = 1.7*10^38 (one half of the seeds)
1.7 * 10^38 divided by 7*10^12 Hashes/s = 2.4 * 10^25 seconds = 7.6 * 10^17 years.

In short, when you have a rapidly deflating currency loans won't work, but **savings** works wonders. People often live in rented space saving up for a down payment for a home (which is hard when the currency is inflating).
With hyper-deflating currency, your savings for a down payment can instead rapidly increase in value and allow you to buy the house for cash (no loan needed).

That amount has worked for me in several transactions over the past few days. The thing to remember is that there are multiple factors miners consider when looking at transactions (the fee, the amount being spent, the age of the inputs, the number of inputs etc...). So if you are rapidly spamming one transaction after another, or using a lot of dust as inputs, they won't be processed as quickly as infrequent transactions with older or fewer inputs.

The problem is defining fraudulent. Just because someone says so, doesn't make it so.
Also, trying to blacklist coins from certain addresses destroys a key property of Bitcoin as money, namely fungibility.
Fungible: that is, one unit or piece must be perceived as equivalent to any other, which is why diamonds, works of art or real estate are not suitable as money.

The article says:




This is a common misconception of Bitcoin newbies. The reality is that you can "get in" for $1 (or even $0.01 if you want). $1 is approximately the current price for 1 mBTC. Bitcoin is as divisible as we need it to be, something that readily distinguishes it from tulips (another tired and unoriginal comparison the author makes).
The divisibility of Bitcoin means it could easily absorb any amount of demand which also destroys the authors argument for "market cornering". There are plenty of other misconceptions in the article but my time is limited. Author would do well to read up more on Bitcoin before writing about it further:

First I'd take all the money seized by the FBI and start handing it out as small bitcoin tips on reddit from a throwaway account as a distraction. 
I'd say something like I won't be giving away more than $100 USD worth of Bitcoin tips per hour so the market wouldn't be spooked into a massive sell-off.
While the world was focused on that event and the FBI was left scrambling to figure out how their security was cracked, I'd begin moving money from old and likely unused address (for example early 50 BTC amounts mined but then likely abandoned) to the various exchanges and selling them slowly (no more than 100 BTC per hour). I would continue to do that over the next several days/weeks slowly driving down the price of BTC until the market woke up to what was happening and initiated the final mass sell-off.
Could probably get several 10s of millions in USD out that way.
The End.

Yes, the fallacy in this argument is the following:


While it is certainly *possible* to throw all 1000 BTC on the market, it is obvious that this would be a highly self destructive move. More likely the one who gains control of such a sum would act like a rational market participant and start spending it very very slowly at first. Even so, due to the transparent nature of the block chain, the market would immediately become aware that this new amount was in play and begin taking that into account.
One might think that doubling or tripling the monetary base in a very short time frame like that would be highly disruptive but market momentum is a strange thing; it takes a while for such adjustments to work their way through an economy. We don't have to look far to see this is the case; just consider recent rapid adjustments to the monetary base in the United States:
And yet the U.S. economy continues on.... no collapse yet!


Rather than abandon BTC entirely, risk averse market participants should already have diversified their holdings before such an event happened. This is already true today as governments and even some companies hold large quantities of both foreign currency and gold in reserve. The point of these reserves is to act as a shock absorber in the case that any single currency becomes unstable.

It makes no difference whether it's a government, a central bank or a community of crypto-currency nerds. Someone has actively decided to use this as money and call it so, thus = fiat.

Never fear, when red candles appear Darkwang_08 will be here. ;-)

Well first they will send you a nasty letter threatening to take you to court unless you settle the amount you owe them. If you do nothing *then* they will take you to court

Boring (stable prices) is great for people actually using Bitcoin to buy and sell products.
Only speculators could enjoy daily moves like we've seen of 20%+ in either direction.

Not only that, but virtual currency is not legal tender (money) at all. It is just a virtual product created by the free market and sometimes sold for legal tender. FinCEN has absolutely no business regulating it anymore than they should be regulating the sale of these:
Until Virtual Currency is defined legally as money I'm going to simply ignore FinCEN.

Yes, this is definitely a "Stress Test" Bitcoin style.... unlike the B.S that passed for stress testing in the Banking Industry which is really just "what-if" scenario testing:

Indeed, but they say it anyways. Profit! :-D

That's because the NASDAQ is a TBT-Fail owned and run by the same PTB that own/run the MSM.
Whoa - that's a lot of TLAs.

No worries - we are all ignorant about different things, but together we can hopefully learn more.
BTW, I just learned something I did not know yesterday. There is apparently some research work ongoing at John Hopkins to add privacy improvements to Bitcoin. Perhaps these improvements will better address your concerns. The takeaway is Bitcoin doesn't just stand still - it will continue to be improved over time so that some of the issues your brought up might simply vanish!

A personal message to the "regulators":

I can't disagree with you on that and I guess if they can charge a premium for it, then good for them!

Because running a GPU will earn you bitcoins very slowly at this point and in fact probably not enough to offset what you are paying for your electric bill. Kind of blows a hole in your strategy.
Also, difficulty will be increasing so rapidly in the near future that GPUs will become as useless as CPUs for mining Bitcoin. ASICs are really the only viable game in town going forward. Keep in mind that the number of bitcoins is automatically limited by difficulty so the more people that mine, the less each individual miner will get.
