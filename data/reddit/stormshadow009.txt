Thanks, I looked at that already
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:46:27
I have a bunch of drives and currently running win 7 and 10, the only thing i have to worry about is grub? breaking the boot, but windows sucks and i need to reinstall anyway.  I could probably boot from usb or cd, any particular variant? 
  Also, please explain the search string, thanks.
  **i think it was the kind that started with a 1
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:25:20
Thanks man that's pretty much exactly what i was looking for.  So i need to boot Linux, and that will search inside of files?  Would you mind explaining the search syntax, i may have outsmarted myself hiding the keys and need to be more creative in the search.

doesn't look familiar so let's hope not, as finding that piece of paper would be slightly less difficult than getting hypnotized to remember the entire keys lol -  hey that might be worth a shot.. (*&amp;%# I feel like I've seen that name before
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:29:10
it was the keys, when i woke up this morning I remembered(maybe) saving it as a file disguised as something else.  I destroyed the file system but recovered the files.  This is going to be a brutal treasure hunt..
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:04:49


that is pretty creative lol, though it was a site where I purchased it, not very user friendly, and the only one that I was able to actually do it at... I think.. ughh
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:38:03
that's.. well dammit.  I asked in another thread if there it was recoverable from identifying the tx, most people seemed to think so.  I honestly didn't think so, but why not be sure.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:37:40
had the keys on it, didn't throw it out forever cuz it seemed like it was for something important.  Only today when I was trying to really use my Etherium wallet for the first time did it hit me what it was and then I remembered someone making fun of me for buying bitcoins (lots of drinking etc, and I was using cards for everything, that's how i'm sure i used one to buy with).  It's a super long shot, but hopefully it's still in my stuff/junk somewhere... cuz it's proving tough to find the transaction and even if I do, that hardly guarantees access to the coins.

hey, not a loss yet! lol :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:26:55
don't remember, see 2 below plz, I can't find info on the early sellers
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:00:18
checked paypal.. struck out :(
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:49:52
That had occurred to me, which is why I'm furiously searching for the sellers name! 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:36:12
I checked the drive and I *think* it's been over-written since then. Searched anyway but didn't find anything.  I don't think I would have stored like that anyway. There was a paper wallet, literally a piece of a notepad sheet I wouldn't throw out for the longest time cuz the two lines on it *looked* important lol.  I only remembered it yesterday when figuring out my Ethereum wallet.  So far the hunt has proved fruitless.. but it's not over yet.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:59:17
no i payed for it, that much i remember :) .. at least most of it lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:21:26
it's not in any of the emails I checked, but I probably would have used a fake or burner address cuz it was supposed to be "anonymous" ... ya i know credit card lol
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:35:43
ya i know, finding the transaction would be easier, but not at all easy, possible names would help to identify said tx.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:16:19
i used a cc so they have my name and cc i won't have the statements for 2 to 6 weeks in the mail, just got off the phone with card company, but thanks for ur help...
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:17:54
it was a website, i think there was yellow in the color scheme? i dunno
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:33:32
don't have the records yet, serious headache to acquire and sift thru them.  was checking to see if there was any point to the mission cuz i don't wanna do it for nothing if my time is better spent searching for the piece of paper which might be gone or the file which also might be gone or was on the drive where i skunked the file system - cuz it's not on any other drive.  This would be the easiest way, IF it's viable.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:45:39
hey there's still dumb luck and a piece of paper that may or may not be amid likely thousands - or fertilizing a garbage heap somewhere
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:05:52
gettin statements from feb 2011....
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:48:34
dammit.. I kind of wish I hadn't remembered *sigh*
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:40:31
i thought of that, but we ended.. not on good terms lol and I don't want to call them until I know it's worth it.. I'd have to ask for a LOT of statements from a few different cards, I'll probably recognize the sellers site's name. I hope.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:24:22
i don't remember, but it was like one of the few if not like the only one i could buy it at, say 2010, maybe '11
*in canada? I think it was $0.75 per bitcoin.. that seems accurate but it's sooo fuzzy, edit: I think it was either worth that and i paid more, or it was worth less and I had to pay that..
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:38:35
NM! getting statements from feb 2011... odds are.. eek, 50-50? omg.. this is going to drive me insane, not to mention waiting however many weeks he sait.. lol i already forgot, 2 to 6?
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:23:49
i think it was the same place i bought it, i only remember the piece of paper i wrote it on that i wouldn't throw out cuz i thought the long strange lines numbers looked important, and the 0x4? that started it just hit me when i was messing with my ethereum wallet edit: i've been tearing my place apart looking for that paper lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:31:40
3 transfers later, still holding with cc company, wow do they not like me lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:17:02
from what i've read it *MIGHT* be early enough lol, thanks :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:43:02
I checked the drive, it's been over-written since then.. wait email like gmail.. suddenly i'm glad they erase nothing! I'll be back.  I was gonna say I don't have the statements.. but i might have some.. checking email, good thinking!
