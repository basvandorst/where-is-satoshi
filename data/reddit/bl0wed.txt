Pretty good coverage. Lee camp is pretty ahead of the curve.

Why can't you just explain your point and not be an arrogant fuck on the internet?

Let me preface this by saying in the biggest Bitcoin bull: you're full of shit. Mining (which drives Bitcoin) is the *last* thing that will better us all in the current trajectory the climate is headed. The greed and self interest (and short sightedness) in human society have essentially fucked the planet into a irreversible downward spiral.

This also works. And just like the model T and Ford, Bitcoin has the advantage of being first in the market. And no one would say the model T was the best implementation of a car.

How does eth scale worse then bitcoin but allows more transactions per second?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:48:59
Lmao people are giving horrible advice
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:01:58
The exchange and miners take a small (ish) cut
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:48:36
Lol ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:34:35
Yeah I'll take someone who's name is noculturalmarxism seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:13:49
Lol dude is dense
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:26:51
Not ones that can scale. Eth, LTC, ada, and maybe iota.

Canned foods aren't exactly good for you.

"I like engines but don't like cars"
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:39:50
Yeah no
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:51:27
I would say you should probably buy in at different points instead of all at once but yeah go for it. You have serious potential to make some change.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:57:21
Real shit

Fuck that. He's cool because he invented the tech but fuck whales.

Ah. You're one of those stem pushers. There's literally memes about guys like you. I see I'm wasting my time here.
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:18:54
Ok so do stuff you find boring and hate and make money! Have fun being miserable!
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:47:25
That is because our perceptions are manipulated into thinking we need degrees for things that come from the heart. If you love art do art, don't spend money and get into debt for a piece of paper that says you now know art.
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:00:49
Also would like to know
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:21:01
It already exists
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:17:43
So basically wait until after Nov 17 to try again?
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:23:27
You literally got downvotes for having a different opinion on something trivial like a car. You didn't even say anything insulting you just stated your opinion. Thisa perfect example of how broken the vote system is
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:17:57
The guy is saying do what you love, not spend money on a useless degree that a university is glad to sell you.
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:48:32
Where in chi?
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:07:50
You didn't. your representatives did
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:24:22
How did I not know about this?
