Excellent site, bbeen looking for something like this. Will be using it sir!

You can choose the amount you bet at the top and the number of mines on the slider at the bottom.

Exactly, it's seriously as simple as this. The woman can remain silent. The court can hold her in contempt for a bit, but eventually her incarceration would turn into a "cruel and unusual punishment," you can't  hold someone in jail indefinitely for something that presumably (without access to her encrypted laptop) she can't be proven guilty of. 
@_date: 2012-02-04 02:05:01
You can actually adjust the number of mines on the mine field at the bottom, from 3 to 24. 10 is just the default.

You're understating international money transfer fees, it is more expensive than this.

Thus.. there's hoarding. Until people start to use the currency,until there are enough markets people aren't using it... it is hoarding, there's no way around that. Just because you reason you keeping all those BTC differently than "hoarding" doesn't mean it's not exactly what is happening.

Stop being a paranoid wanker OP.

I have very high doubts that you really know anything about libertarians or  bitcoins at all. Your post is thus ignored.

You are a lawyer in Africa.

You are naive. Google is good, but cloned / stolen CCs still go through all the time. Carding is a huge intl. black market.

Also to add, if he was behind it in some way, why offer the 49% refund? Why not just take it all? It's a rather unsubstantiated claim full of "OMG hosting is same!!OMG Ted=Tom Williams correlations!!!"

Ron Paul proposes and says a lot of things. Nothing ever gets accomplished, and to add insult to injury, he's a religious nut. Let the down votes begin!

Kind of like Bitcoin Kamikaze, you can use my referral link but you don't have to. You can adjust amount of mines, and you can play right away, with unconfirmed transactions, and cash your winnings out when your payments get confirmed.

While I agree with a lot of what you say, one thing that is questionable is your disapproval of the government stimulus, saying it "hurt the economy." What do you suggest they should have done instead? Tax cuts? Cutting spending? Saying that the stimulus didn't work is ludicrous. While unemployment is still high, and the economy is still shit, both have significantly improved from 2008. Had we done nothing, or cut government spending during the recession, I think we would be sitting in a major depression right now.

I suspect Timmy is flat-out wrong. "So, barring a major screw-up by the Federal Reserve, we can count on the value of dollars not falling very much." This man doesn't know economics, and I certainly don't think he understands Bitcoin at all either. Move along people, just another crap-piece Forbes blog.
@_date: 2011-09-27 03:18:39
In all reality the SR is the foundation of BitCoin right now. It is the reason BTC's are still around at the 5 dollar mark. It is the site with the highest BTC volumes no doubt.
@_date: 2011-08-07 21:10:23
Yea holorga is the dev of the site and he'll be glad to resolve any problems, just pm him!
@_date: 2011-08-09 19:06:37
Nope, they got it correct.
@_date: 2011-08-18 23:05:39
A service that offers to launder your BTC is somewhat shady / dodgy??NO WAY, who would of thought!
@_date: 2011-08-03 13:39:50
I know, I mean encrypting and storing significant amounts of BTC in your own wallet.dat should be second nature...It's scary that people were listening to Bruce Wagner and his "recommendations" just because he is on some Bitcoin online tv show. After mt.gox got hacked I watched him do Q&amp;A with Tradehill programmers / owner and then mt.gox guys too, and it was obvious he did not have a clue about what they were talking about. I have absolutely no sympathy for him and his 25,000 BTC loss, absolutely deserves it after preaching about something he obviously had no clue about.

I was never implying that the dollar was less stable, of course not, rather his cocky "dollar is always king" attitude. He fails to realize that the U.S. economy is a leech, its strength depends on literally exploiting the rest of the world to stay on top. The dollar's dominance will not last forever, people eventually figure out what's going on. Bitcoin is a different concept, something I really doubt this Forbes blogger can really grasp. I really do still have faith in it, Bitcoin's uses in the virtual internet world are innumerable, I think this sell-off is due to some really shitty piles of news hitting us lately, but I think there's too much passion for the project for Bitcoin to die out, to be "terminal."
@_date: 2011-07-19 02:06:19
I do, but it's money that needs to be used for bills/ other expenses. I'm a student, but If I had money to invest in a lot of Bitcoins I would.
@_date: 2011-08-26 19:16:53
Can anyone explain this in layman's terms, I'm interested but don't know enough about Options and specifically Bitcoin Options.
@_date: 2011-08-05 06:41:00
"going into receivership" and "large amount" is AKA for bankruptcy and all BTC are gone.
@_date: 2011-08-08 05:47:45
I do agree that it only has about a few decades left, but this blog seems to put it on the pedestal like it the right economics theory and will always stay true. Competition and innovation are always good for economic growth and I think the Bitcoin currency is something fresh out there in the digital world, I stand by it.
@_date: 2011-08-03 13:29:40
Bruce Wagner sure is the "pro" to listen to for BTC investment advice. Oh yea that 25,000 BTC he had stored on an unknown website and gave his recommendation to use to others? Meh, it's just a small 25,000 loss for him, and an unknown loss for the thousands of others that heeded his advice. Just because Bruce has been around for a while and is on a Bitcoin Tv online show, doesn't mean you should listen to him or that he really knows what is going on. I watched the guy talking about Bitcoin security and this and that when the mt.gox hack happened, and obviously he was not as informed as he acted. I mean encrypting and storing significant amounts of BTC in your own wallet.dat should be second nature...
@_date: 2011-08-31 20:58:59
While he may have a history of shady dealings in the past, and a propensity towards paying for sex, I don't understand the mybitcoin.com claims. He was encouraging everyone that had lost BTC from the site to file a report with the FBI. If he was really behind it in some way, do you really think he would have been encouraging people to involve the FBI and start investigating?
@_date: 2011-08-03 13:58:49
While my "absolutely deserves it" choice of words was rather poor, and no one deserves to get something stolen from them, I do believe that for Bitcoin to continue to thrive, people that give out unsound advice and crap need to be weeded out. Is it really beneficial for the Bitcoin community to have a guy that absolutely has no idea what he's talking about give out "advice" and be the spokesperson for the masses on the subject? A lot of people lost significant amounts of BTC from mybitcoin because Bruce recommended it constantly on his online shows and websites, instead of preaching the right way to store and secure your Bitcoins...in your personal wallet.dat
