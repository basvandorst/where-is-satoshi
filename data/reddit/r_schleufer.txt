Not trading. Just buying Bitcoin on Coinbase, and either cashing back out or purchasing something with it.
@_date: 2014-01-10 09:40:28
This is a great start and looks helpful.
Unfortunately I have a Mac, so this may not help me too much. I did happen to see a download for Bitcoin-Qt for MacOS, so I can still investigate.

I had never heard of, nor considered Overstock before all this. So not only is this good for Bitcoin, but it's also good for Overstock to reach people like me. I don't buy much online, but Overstock is now on my radar.
Now if I could only buy and receive Bitcoin immediately through Coinbase, I could make quick purchases. I'd rather not use the Coin (yes, just one) that I already have.

I'm not even saying we need advertising. I'm saying that we should invest in something that gets exposure on a massive scale, something that shows this isn't a niche, it isn't for nerds, it isn't going away. Nothing provokes permanence like the average joe talking about it.
Circle jerking into the same group that is already aware isn't going to get us anywhere.

*sigh* I work in advertising. No a Hackathon is not the way to go and I could give you 300 reasons why. The main reason is that they aren't televised and they don't reach millions of 'average' people.

I don't think you add a hell of lot to the discussions, but considering the people you choose to criticize and randomly call 'shills' (which dilutes the term), it seems these opposites of the spectrum balance each other. We have Dickbags_08 on one side and shills on the other.

I agree. In the future, I suspect that every person that holds Bitcoin will have the capability of mining, because they won't be mining new Bitcoins (it'll cap out eventually). Instead, they'll be handling the transactions for a tiny fee.

This isn't purely a coding problem. You could throw coders at this all day long and get nowhere. You'll need experienced and skilled UX and UI designers/developers as well.
UX and UI are the frontline to define how the problem will be solved to work with the existing backend. Coders will be used to tie them together.

Okay, I was using miners and hashing power interchangeably, which is incorrect. I agree that hashing needs to be decentralized, but for the time being I think this was handled very well. Is this a perfect solution, no, because we shouldn't have gotten to that point in the first place.

Your criticisms might be valid, but you are basically trying to stamp out a forest fire by yelling at it. The methods you employ are bad, and you see yourself as some kind of misunderstood saviour and hero. There are so many other big problems in the world, and someone blowing their fortune isn't even in the top 1000.
I really don't feel a bit of pity for someone that wants to put $500K or a Million in Bitcoin- thats far more money than most people will ever see in their lifetime.
Bitcoin doesn't only have potential to do something good in the future, it can do it now. If it fails, then at least it did something great during its lifetime.
Which is better than most people can claim.
I really don't feel that you add anything constructive to any conversation, because you completely fail to acknowledge that you might be wrong. Nobody is 100%.

Mass selling of Bitcoin for fiat tends to drive price down (surplus Bitcoin, not enough buyers). Yet businesses that are interested in accepting Bitcoin usually will not hold, but rather immediately sell for fiat's stability. This creates a perpetual cycle that prevents Bitcoin stability. What are the key industries that need to accept Bitcoin in order to boost stability? In other words, who or what would encourage the businesses to hold or spend their Bitcoin, rather than cash out?
@_date: 2014-09-07 17:55:35
I think people are missing something important here: Coinbase may only be required to ask the question(s), but you aren't required to give a timely response or a response at all. Nor are you required to give plausible/valid answers.
From the letter: "Can you please provide us with the following information at your convenience".
AT YOUR CONVENIENCE.
Stay away from answers that have plausibility, and stick with the absurdly impossible, if you choose to respond at all. I simply wouldn't answer. Scam emails are bound to come in this familiar format.

Yes, it's high. But they were able to knock back their influence/capacity by more than 25% in a matter of days. That is impressive.
I'd be even more impressed if they capped it at 30%.
Thanks GHash.IO, you've earned my respect for responsibility.
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:51:15
Specifically? Directly from GHash.IO:
• We will temporarily stop accepting new independent mining facilities to 
the Ghash.IO pool. 
• We will implement a feature, allowing CEX.IO users to mine bitcoins from other pools. So when they purchase GH/s they can put it towards any pool they choose.
At least 25% of their miners moved, which shows that they had a group of extremely responsible and conscientious miners.
I'm not denying that GHash.IO has problems, they certainly aren't perfect. But what they did, and what happened is remarkable within that timeframe.
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:15:24
You specifically said BTC would crash to $100 before it ever rose to $1000 again. It has risen to $1000 (MTGOX) twice more. Admit that you are wrong at least once in a while, and you'll receive a tiny bit of credibility. The people you criticize are no worse than your claims.

bitvisitor.com pays out regularly, but it can take a while to rack up the minimum. Pay varies between 12 uBtc and 0.6 uBtc (yes, less than a Satoshi) but requires very little interaction.
bitcoinget.com has really gone downhill, but also pays regularly (24 hrs). I won't bother with the majority of the tasks on that site- avoid the special offers altogether. I have been paid from a couple special offers (using a fake email, etc.) but it really isn't worth the time because MOST will not pay- it ends in a cycle you can't exit. Look over a couple tasks, the same ones keep popping up all the time, so once you learn the mechanism they get easier. Some of them are just too demanding for the little pay- you'll quickly learn which ones to avoid (or just avoid all except the videos).
Neither site requires an account, only your address (some bitcoinget tasks do require a login through crowdflower- those do pay too).
None of these will make you rich, unless Bitcoin suddenly jumps 10000% overnight, but its a good way to get started without investing your own money. I buy Bitcoin, but also delve into the free coins as well.
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:25:00
This is definitely an option, but I want to permanently move my coin to a paper wallet. That won't leave me with much more than $25 in Coinbase. I guess it wouldn't kill me to hold at least 0.1 BTC online just for purchases. And then replenish.

Fine, I'll be the idiot.
You may as well be speaking a foreign language. The words you are saying make sense, but not in the current configuration. This post is far too vague for someone like me to figure out what to do. I've looked into this briefly (20 minutes or so, because I really should be coding right now), and it seems Windows is required? Are there options for Mac or Linux? Isn't specific mining hardware required? I can't seem to find a basic 'how-to'.
The problem is, this information is extremely easy to find if one knows where to look. I don't know where to look, nor what I'm even looking for.

Wells Fargo is a huge institution, backed by the FDIC and Billions in assets and more billions in revenue. Their apps are required to meet certain security measures under heavy regulation. Nobody except Wells Fargo can release a Wells Fargo app. I'm not even sure why you'd even consider comparing Coinbase to WF.
This goes way beyond Coinbase, though. It goes beyond basic Bitcoin functionality (a ticker). It is simply 'safer' for Apple to ban all Bitcoin apps at this time, rather than risk a serious security flaw- a flaw that isn't inherent to iOS, but rather flawed app design or malicious apps.
No, Apple can't ban access to Coinbase.com through Safari (I mean, they could, but they won't). For me, this is good enough and this is all I need. I'm not even sure why there is need for further discussion. Is there a specific functionality that the app had that the mobile site doesn't? This sounds more like an issue that Coinbase mobile needs to address, not Apple.
I have no idea what Apple is planning. What I DO know is that currently Bitcoin threatens their in-app purchases. I could put my address in my game, and completely bypass Apple for in-app purchases. Apple might be wise to investigate Bitcoin as an alternative for app and in-app purchases.
You have to realize that not a single large player is completely on-board with Bitcoin at this point. Apple would be among the biggest in the tech industry- there are few that can rival it.
I maintain that people are simply fucking stupid. They are the weakest link to any security measure. Every day I hear about how someone was scammed out of Bitcoin. Yes, the same can be said about banking and credit fraud as well, but those are much bigger institutions than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is small potatoes compared to all the other monetary exchanges that happen in the world daily. Bitcoin doesn't have a method to recover lost or stolen coins- thats part of the problem of anoniminity.
I'm not sure what else you want me to say.

I don't recall him (or her?) claiming to speculate over those ten years.
It is possible the money was put into a 401K that wasn't properly managed and lost. It is possible part of his bonus/paycheck was stock options in the company, which took a serious downturn (this happened massively during the dotcom bubble). There are a crap-ton of specifics that I (we?) don't know about this particular loss of 70K over 10 years.
Every major investor that I know has lost some money at one time. It isn't 100%, it is all risk. The more risk, the bigger the potential return, the bigger the potential fail.

You can set up multiple coinbase accounts that all filter into a single bank account.  I own my server and my domain, multiple email accounts are all filtered to a single email for easy management. When the transactions are completed, I can move the coins wherever I want (to a single account). I know this isn't optimal, but it gets around the buy limits.

The banks sure as hell don't have enough cash if everyone decided to cash out as well. I'm not sure if he actually understands the stupidity in his own statement.
Ideally, we shouldn't be cashing out, we need to spend the Bitcoin itself for it to be currency. This is where everyone seems to be confused about what Bitcoin is and can be.

Oh look, it's the same armchair investor dickbag that gave him grief before!
I don't think you know a damn thing about investing- there are people that are down 10-20 million in a single day. I wouldn't exactly call them a loser when they can simply shrug it off. You seem to be under the impression that never losing a dime is the way to go, and only somebody with a 100% track record is the only person to trust- good luck with that.
On another point, nobody has a reason to EVER cash out of Bitcoin because it shouldn't simply be a short term investment. It can become a currency to where car/house payments can be made directly. There isn't any reason to ever see a dollar again. So you advising ANYONE to cash out is poor advice in terms of longterm Bitcoin. I'd actually appreciate it if you and others like you would simply GTFO now so that Bitcoin can stabilize. Whether it sits at $1 or $10,000, I don't care. I want stability.

Downvotes? I don't downvote people if I disagree with them.
I think you have something valid to say, but I don't like the way you express it. I didn't downvote any of your comments.
My only qualm with you is that you seem to think that losing 70K (over 10 years) automatically discredits anything someone might have to say about investment or financials. He currently (supposedly) has over $400K invested now, which isn't necessarily a small number so he is apparently doing very well at this time.
I have no knowedge of this person, nor their true situation, so anything they say can't be verified. But I do know that this particular person isn't any different than any other millionaire I know- they gain money, they lose money. Its a huge gamble.
My hard guess is that you are under 25 years old with very little life experience. If you are much older, I apologize. Either way, I am not trying to insult you in any way.

It won't piss Apple off.

What it will do is frustrate people like you who don't have a concept of who Apple is (not a democracy). Apple is going to continue whatever Apple does- but when Apple finally does release its plan for Bitcoin, there will be much back-patting going on around here about what a great job everyone did to change Apples mind.
The truth is, you did nothing. But keep on doing what you're doing, because the possibility of me changing your mind is equivalent to you changing Apples mind.
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:49:40
This is a really, really bad idea if you want Bitcoin to go anywhere.
Currently, Apple doesn't have the capacity to monitor the validity of what the app is doing. There is a huge potential for fraud without safeguards in place.
I'm an Apple developer. If history is any indication, Apple is currently working on a solution to either add their own app to the OS, they have worked out an exclusive deal with a major Bitcoin player or they will add Bitcoin to their app store for purchases. They aren't ignoring it.
My advice is to leave Apple alone for a while, and if it really bothers you, go buy an Android. But leave Apple alone.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:25:37
Pick any single statement you've ever said. I see no indications that you know anything about investing, other than the above blanket statement. Which is completely false. This is EXACTLY what he said, quoted:
"I am so blessed that over the past 10 years I've lost $70,00 permanently from company crashes."
This can be taken in any number of ways, and it absolutely does NOT say that he has a negative return on investments.
There is also no indication of his total investments, nor specifics on his portfolio at the time. I personally have no judgements at this time, because the data I have on the situation is incomplete.
If he invested $10 million and only lost $70K in the process, he could be extremely lucky. If he only invested $10K (401K) and cashed out at the wrong time, he could lose $70K. My point is, you don't have sufficient data to determine anything.
So go ahead, try to justify your ABOVE statement, without correcting the wording to explain the actual situation- I already gave you the quoted text above.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:26:08
This is actually for both spookybanana and GraduateStudent: So what if you bought in high? As long as you don't sell or spend it yet, you don't actually lose anything. Consider this to be a good (possibly expensive) lesson.
I bought bitcoin because I found myself easily spending $200 - $500 on various Kickstarter campaigns, and donating to charitable causes every month. I squander over $100 a month on coffee alone. What could be more exciting than being a part of one of the biggest financial and economical changes since the invention of currency?
I don't spend any more than I can afford to lose. I seriously do consider the bitcoin buy-in to be 'lost', until a point when I decide to purchase something with bitcoin or sell.
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:58:29
I don't claim to be brilliant. I'm guessing that $70K exceeds your income by quite a large margin, because it seems like a lot of money to you.
Over a ten year span.
No, I'm not an alt. I'm not even a friend of his (or her?). I'm fine with being hilariously dumb, but when you can't even justify your own statements against me, I guess that says more about you than it does me.

I'm not advising anyone to take any advice at all. I don't give two shits what you or anyone else does with their fucking money.
The OP isn't even pitching any kind of investment- they simply state that you need to experience certain things with Bitcoin in order to be 'comfortable in Bitcoin'. Those are the words taken literally from the title.
Nowhere does OP tell people to invest money they don't have. Nowhere does OP tell people to convert large percentage of their investments to bitcoin.
My whole point isn't how much coffee I drink, its how I choose NOT to invest that $1200 a year. Which is probably worse than investing and LOSING it. At least if it were invested, I could possibly see a return.
Yes, the market it volatile, but everyone running around in a panic isn't going to stabilize anything. The only thing that will cause stability is actually buying goods and services with Bitcoin itself, not converting it to dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:34:40
While my method won't eliminate theft altogether, it can limit purchases.
I created an online bank account in order to transfer very tiny amounts of cash to purchase Bitcoin from Coinbase. This is the only account tied to Coinbase, and it WILL NOT overdraw nor pull from savings to complete the transaction. If there are insufficient funds, Coinbase cancels the transaction.
This requires me to be much more active in transferring funds before making a purchase, which is just fine with me. I don't want my main checking or savings accounts tied to Coinbase at all.
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:17:26
My entire comment is mainly about security, but nobody really wants to hear that. The topic is boring and Bitcoin is perfect and secure as hell on its own right?
We can't sit around and pout and throw a tantrum when things don't go our way. Apple was incredibly smart to pull the apps for security reasons- Apple themselves can't secure it. And they know this vulnerability.
The main weakness is the stupidity of the average consumer.
I'm an app developer. I've been doing this since the app store opened. I also develop for Android- where there are nearly zero safeguards and security.
So why is this a really bad idea if you want Bitcoin to go anywhere? Stop acting like a child and pouting when you don't get your way. There are serious measures that need to be taken, and if your balls-out attitude ends up making Bitcoin look like it isn't safe, secure then it isn't going to take hold. The one thing we don't need is a whole lot of Bitcoin fraud happening on mobile devices right now.
Relax. Things will come in due time.

I understand what you are saying, and I don't find any particular errors in your statement. It *could* lead to very large losses, it *could* also lead to very large gains.
Overall, bitcoin is quite a bit different than a normal currency or other investments. We really shouldn't be thinking of bitcoin in terms of entering and exiting, but rather just pure buying power in the future. Ideally, we will (hopefully) never need to 'buy in' nor 'exit' bitcoin: imagine getting your paycheck in bitcoin, and paying all your bills and mortgage in bitcoin.
This will require stability, but stability is never going to happen if people keep buying in and exiting- those who are trading bitcoin aren't exactly interested in 'stability', that isn't in their best interest.
