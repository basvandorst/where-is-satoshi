Thanks for the news. It’s not like we have been observing the price while you were gone, right?

Remind me how actually having an ATM for a digital _currency_ screams of Ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:34:18
You must be a kid, judging by your language and the fact that you don’t know the definition of a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:35:10
And having an ATM will makes this worse?! You make no sense.

I saw a post telling that aliens will abduct Trump to study him.

Overused man in suit fingering the air + overused blockchain background? Take my money.

Not really. It’s the end of the cycle, not the end of Bitcoin.

Maybe people that don’t solely look at the messenger, but the message. Search: argumentum ad hominem.

By your own definition, you are an idiot.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:10:54
And only good people will come after they leave? You are delusional.

It’s always manipulation when it dumps, right? You weren’t crying manipulation when it overshot to the upside.

The problem is not only Tether's market cap, but trading volume. That assertion alone proves that you are unaware of the whole situation.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:16:30
It’s funny that it’s always manipulation when it dumps. No one cries manipulation during a bull run.

"Upward move back to its ATHs". With this low buyer volume? The upward move would take AGES and not sustain the amount of selling volume remaining from the downtrend.
There is only random volume spikes, probably from some whale manipulating the market to create bull traps.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:57:00
With low buying volume? You know nothing.

Racism? Don't conflate race with religion, dumbass.

Good luck falling for this obvious bull trap.

In this same sense, Bitcoin is also tied to the digital economy (most trading pairs) and can also be tied to the analogic economy, given proper time.
You are shifting the goalpost here. What you are arguing is the network effect, which is not the same as being “tied” to anything. Being “tied” means being pegged by another asset.

1. It doesn't even have to be used as a medium of exchange. Its main appeal is of store of value.
2. It can be unconfiscatable as long as the user takes the proper privacy measures. What you see are criminals doxing themselves because they got rich and sloppy. Or large criminal operations that would eventually leave trails. Not a single individual escaping oppression.
3. All freedom and empowerment is dualistic. Freedom of speech is responsible for many horrific things as well, like politicians lobbying for unnecessary wars.

You think that the whole world is your cushy first-world country and you think that everyone is fine with fiat monetary policies.

Attention everyone! A random internet person bought the “dip”. That is valuable information.

Many single large addresses are in fact cold storage addresses belonging to exchanges. They represent many individuals. Additionally, Satoshi’s coins are also included in that figure.
That doesn't affect in any way its deflationary, unconfiscatable properties.

1a. Opening a brokerage account in a dictatorship that leaves you at risk of confiscation? Or a poorly managed country that plainly seizes people's income because of mismanagement, like Greece? Again, speaking from your cushy little bubble.
1b. Which currency is grounded? The value of *any* currency, whether a commodity or a fiat currency, is only relative to what people *think* it's worth. Regardless, volatility isn't really an issue for long term storage of value. In fact, high volatility is needed for the price to appreciate considerably over time.
2. Multi-national criminality is different from individuals escaping oppressive governments.
3. Cash can be used too for lots of nefarious purposes, sometimes even more privately than bitcoin, is cash evil?
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:47:46
1. Some people don't have the luxury of choosing their favorite store of value like you do. And sure, Bitcoin is highly volatile as of now (even though no other asset has appreciated as much since inception), because it's an emergent asset. That is not a deterministic property.
2. Again, you talk about the "state" as a single entity. The world is not the high-tech big brother state that you currently live in (you probably live in the USA, given this common arrogant mindset). And again, this is different than individuals escaping oppression and/or using it as a store of value.
3. I'm not justifying or pitching anything, It's the dualistic nature of the beast. Regardless, the genie is out of the bottle.
