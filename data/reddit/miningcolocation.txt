While some people may be hesitant to give the government BTC, I think this is a fantastic move in regards to long term legitimacy and adoption of crypto.  The more the government plays ball with crypto, the less we have to worry about it being completely banned or demonized

This is why we need blockchain tech to take over the current aging financial system.  Nothing will be lost, and everything will be recorded if we implement a public ledger system

If you're looking to mine your BTC, using 1 graphics card isn't going to be very effective.  Mining can be difficult if you don't do your research as you'll have a lot of hardware to maintain and monitor.  While I'd suggest buying crypto to just get yourself familiar with the concepts, if your heart is set on mining, then get an asic.  They're dedicated mining rigs which are far more powerful than one graphics card.

Haha, trading digital gold for physical silver!  Theres definitely a funny joke in there somewhere! Loving the speed and low costs for transactions as of late.  Can't wait to see how this effects the finance system as a whole.

Blockchain technology is evolving at such a rapid pace I would not be surprised if the banking system as we know it today is not completely overwritten within the next decade.  As the youth begin to take over key financial institutions, the rate of change will exponentially quicken

Social media dominates the crypto ecosystem.  Take trx for example.  During the twitter hype, trx was able to make it into the top 10 coins, but the hype reached a point where expectations were ridiculously high and could not be met.  As a whole, consumers of crypto rely heavily on social media to stay updated on their investments as many ICOs and exchanges have no other forms of direct communication.

 While i would heavily suggest you do not quit your day job as no one can predict the future - if you are dead set on going all, mining will provide you with a guaranteed steady stream of crypto.  Assuming you have some spare capital and are willing to setup an operation which will provide you with enough income, I can definitely get you started.  My company has no maximum order amount, so if you wanted to go all in we could have the asic miners sourced and shipped to you in 6 weeks.  If you have any questions please feel free to email us at sales

Awesome to hear!  One of the great things about the crypto-ecosystem right now is all of the innovation going on.  Everyday we get to learn about new and exciting projects that have the potential to revolutionize our current systems.

That's awesome!  Love how crypto is creeping into everyday life now.  Its a lot easier to achieve mainstream adoption when people can just turn on the TV and see the price of a bitcoin

Congrats!  You'll definitely remember this when Bitcoin prices soar!

Definitely won't be the most up to date price on Bitcoin, but it's fantastic to see bitcoin get picked up by more mainstream media!

MBSWcrypto, make sure you don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  This subreddit is all very optimistic on the future of crypto, but that doesn't mean the price will not fluctuate a lot in the future.  If you plan on hodling you'll be tying up a lot of liquid cash, so I hope you're prepared.  But overall, congratulations!  Too the moon!

I think this is fantastic!  While bitcoin is already fairly big in Japan, anything that gets the public more involved and interested in crypto is a win in my book!

I'd probably recommend using a bitcoin atm.  Some require KYC verification, but a lot of them do not.  A quick google search will let you know where the nearest one to you is.  Good luck :)
