2 years ago I predicted the collapse of the Bitcoin Savings &amp; Trust ponzi.
I was also already using Gox as an example of significant bad events, over a year before they actually collapsed.
I will tell you this:
The feeling in bitcoin right now is very similar to what it was back then, except instead of people flocking to Gox (despite the warnings) they are now flocking to Coinbase, Circle, Coinfloor, Bitstamp, Kraken, OkCoin, etc...
The whole system is more decentralized. There is no single point of failure. Massive amounts of investment are coming in. Big companies such as paypal are taking us seriously.
Trust me. The price WILL rise over the next 12 months. Likely more than you expect.
$50 -&gt; $1,000 was a 20x gain...
$350 * 20 = $7,000
This is a very conservative estimate. Exponential growth tends to WAY outperform the past. I expect at least $50k next year.
You can call me crazy but I don't give a shit about your opinion unless you have been through all the bitcoin bubbles.
p.s. reddit is going to create their own platform, likely colored coins on top of the blockchain ffs... this is massive. I do not believe that it will directly cause a price rise, but it will bring a lot more interest to bitcoin through the reddit community. For example you can expect subscribers to this sub to rise dramatically when it is released (probably about a year away). If it is successful you can expect many more sites/companies/etc to create colored coins.

Good news after good news. Price drop after price drop.
If you were waiting on the sidelines you may never get the opportunity to buy an asset as undervalued as bitcoin is right now.

Unless you have "free" electricity no, it is not that simple.
If you have an Nvidia graphics card you can forget it. If you have an ATI you can scrape just above break even on electricity cost. If you can afford $2k+ on FPGAs you can start to consider breaking even on the cost in about 2 years.
Basically, if you are asking how to mine this late into the game you have no chance.

Just another day in Bitcoin, after all the exchange rate had been stable for far too long.

[GLBSE]( 4-6% a month is easy.
10 BTC is nothing to be honest but you can get started. 
[Here is a table of weekly and monthly dividend returns](
I don't use it but the [gamma Bitcoin fund]( may be up your street since he will do all the work for you. With such a small amount he is probably the safest bet since if you go it alone you would likely be putting it all in one place while he has investments spread all over the place.

It wont be. Bitcoin will rise but not because of some "wave theory" bullshit.

Basically it's very competitive for something not many people have embraced yet.
If Bitcoin is to succeed it needs a unique spin, not just being another mobile payment solution.

[Tons have popped up in the Bitcointalk securities forums recently.]( Read up and take your pick.
Disclaimer: Be cautious, it is inevitable that somebody will pull off a large scale scam at some point. I would venture a guess and say within the next 2-3 months since GLBSE is going through such massive growth at the moment and hasn't had any significant events to learn for yet (a la gox).

Well I had a pirate pass through and got a good deal with the operator by getting in when it was first made.
I have no idea why the sell history is so limited, I sold a lot more than the 340 I started with (more than 500 which was the req for this thread). I got out quite far ahead of the collapse. I have invested in HYIPs and ponzis before so know the ropes. That doesn't make me invincible, I could have easily lost it but I only invested as much as I can afford to lose. After all 500 BTC is nothing compared to my overall stash of btc :)
I've had plenty more in non-pirate stuff as well but I am out of the Bitcoin game for now. I will definitely be back for more high risk investments if anything crops up, the mining ops and regular stuff on GLBSE just doesn't cut the mustard. If you get in on the IPO it can be worth it, but other than that it's not worth it at the moment.

Bitcoinica gives ~6% yearly interest for holding Bitcoin with them to provide incentive to people to leave their coin there, this is to keep their reserves of Bitcoin high which is required for the services that they provide (such as shorting).

5k is nothing.
Most of the high rollers are more willing to cash out over a longer time and make more profit.
Just wait till the price goes up again, now that there is uncertainty that we will make $100, people (including myself) will be selling in chunks much larger than 5k to get rid of holdings ASAP.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:09:50
