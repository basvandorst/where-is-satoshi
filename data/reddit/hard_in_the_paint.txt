Bitcoin advice for the concerned Satanist:  buy more bitcoin before the christians do
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:31:14
A hand in what?  Clearing the mempool?  27 sat/b is going to take a while.  If its REALLY that important you can pay china and additional fee to mine it:   
I wouldn't do that yet though.

$2,210,345,768 trade volume is a "tiny small percentage" in your flawed world.  Funny stuff!
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:47:05
Huh?  A $9.4B penny stock with 30% of the total coin trade volume only 6% behind bitcoin?  What are you even saying?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:33:05
I just checked, bitcoin.org is the 1st result

Fun fact: losing 80-280% profit is not a thing to brag about

Attacks on reddit matter?  Since when?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:29:13
We just need to wait &amp; see what a 10 min difficulty adjustment &amp; what the mining rewards will be on BCH.  If the difficulty, rewards, &amp; price of BCH vs BTC stay near parity then nothing should happen.  If BCH becomes "almost always" more profitable to mine than BTC, the miners 100% will follow the profit.  This will cause the majority of the global hash to go back to BCH like it was early yesterday.  Bitcoin will be become slow, expensive &amp; barely usable at that point (once again, like it was early yesterday).  I have the feeling this is their goal but we just have to wait and see.

There are many benefits to this.  The main one being that it SHOULD become the true price for bitcoin (meaning the price on the CME will be the price all the tiny exchanges follow).  This will also bring the massive amount of HFT bots to bitcoin which actually could be a positive (more liquidity and a more stable price).  Plus the very simple one:  it gives the people a stable &amp; fair exchange to dip their toes into bitcoin (even though its just a derivative, that doesn't really matter... price is king).

Still needs to go up an assload more to defend from Jihan's attacks
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:55:10
The other 40-45% of miners that are not in China wouldn't even support this...
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:13:12
Fix this polo you fucking slack ass fucks.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:09:38
There is also no way of knowing what txn fees should be, if exchanges will have stable wallets open for deposit, if there will be enough hash power to confirm txns in a timely manner, how many confirmations exchange wallets will require before considering the txn valid, and probably a dozen more things...
I have the feeling all the people eagerly waiting to "dump BCH" are going to be waiting and waiting and waiting...

If the herd is all saying "Do A", the markets tend to go "Okay, I'll do B".

He should've stayed around a few more days to hack ViaBTC and steal all of the BCC.  Such wasted potential!
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:32:54
is that 0.023 coming from the blackbytes?
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:53:00
This is reddit, its a shame.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:53:16
You just someone?  What?
Edit:  Okay now it makes sense :D
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:02:19
I agree with you on the mining parts especially if it is deemed to be "more profitable" to mine BCC.  They will be selling a product that can mine BTC and BCC, new consumers of their product will mine the the most profitable coin (and existing owners could/would switch).  This whole thing is all about MAX profit which makes perfect sense...  it just really sucks that its causing so much confusion and has a damaging effect to other coins.
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:18:50
So can coins.  You see that BCC is trading now right?  Get a grip.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:07:02
You can always try localbitcoins, I know it sucks but ALL of the options suck.  You should try dealing with poloniex support, basically the biggest exchange out there (besides the Korean one), and they take weeks and weeks and weeks.  They enable/disable altcoin wallets due to issues with the coins (which is good) but don't post a warning about it.  Their last status tweet was about 6 weeks ago.
Its really pathetic.  These companies are making (MANY) millions.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:57:14
This really doesn't make sense.  You talk like a global fiat would be a solution.  Look at the euro.  Its a failure.

Yeah but he owns bitcoin DOT COM, which was my exact point.  Think rationally here...

Thanks China!

Also guys you can check to see how many BTC have been linked at this site here: 
A lot!
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:36:34
Coinbase is not supporting BCC or giving it to users holding BTC on their platform.  Most exchanges aren't.  If you want to get the BCC, you'll need to have it in a wallet where you control the keys.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:18:11
Nope.  Its just demon.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:13:09
Been thinking this since a week ago Saturday.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:44:15
Well you're wrong but you can believe whatever.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:20:34
So if this happens, people will go bitcoin.com and see... what?  How to install a BCC wallet?  How to buy BCC?  Short videos about BCC?  Could there possibly be a way to confuse the public MORE about bitcoin?  This doesn't sound like a responsible direction....
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:03:25
If you're LONG (this has nothing to do with time):
You've gained (or lost) nothing until you sell (go flat), you just have something that you could currently sell.
If you're SHORT (again this has nothing to do with time):
You've gained (or lost) nothing until you cover, you just have something that you could currently buy-to-cover.
This stuff is simple. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:17:00
It is happening faster than I figured.  Roger &amp; Jihan are going to push Bitcoin China, we all know this.  Roger said that his efforts were going fully towards BCC if the 2x portion of segwit2x didn't happen.  He is going to make sure it doesn't so he can promote BCC (which he will be one of the major holders of).  Dark times ahead for bitcoin my friends and it seems nothing is going to stop this.
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:50:47
This is a good reply.  The issues I've had with polo have been caused by outside sources, not polo themselves.  People tend to blame the wrong sources for their issues because they don't understand what is actually happening.
*I've never had to put in a ticket to support and I know theres an issue with their response time, I'm talking about depo/withdraw issues and usability.
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:17:06
Extra simpleton time:
A.  Nope
B.  It is rigged.  If you can explain why I'll give you a pat on the head.
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:00:27
Okay man.
So "no one" is going to buy it even though there are already millions traded in a one way market.  Check.
The game is rigged but you claim that game theory still applies to a rigged game.  Check.

Okay I'll dumb it down for you based off of your last two points.
"Exchanges prices are not reliable"  = Wrong.  Full stop.
"I don't think"  = Right.  Full stop.
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:21:04
So its 1/16th of a byteball per BTC. At current market value, found here: 
that would be 0.0625 * 3 * $838.52 = $157.22 :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:09:39
So what this tells me is:  All the people eagerly waiting to sell their BCH tomorrow probably won't even be able to get it to an exchange for quite some time.  So the only real trading of BCH tomorrow will be from people that have bitcoins on exchanges that support BCH (like Kraken &amp; Bitfinex).  Everyone else is just going to have to wait....
Very interesting!
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:45:13
This is a very well written article but it has major flaws.
1.  The reason BCC has monetary value is because it is being purchased
2.  Game theory doesn't work when the game is rigged
