bitcoiners have also been derided for being pale, male and stale and they want women to get into bitcoin. At least wait for misogyny charges against them before you make them see what gamergate has to put up with.

You should fix it considering that if men were to partake in other subjects you wouldn't have the male ghettoisation of the CS.
But the likes of you wouldn't.

Against feminism, [yes](
If women are not people, then men are, so feminism seeks that you treat women as men, clear?
When feminists claim that "women won the vote" they are being misogynistic sexist bigots who think all women wanted the vote enough to win it, while all evidence points to that they did not, if not an overwhelming majority, [then at least quite a few](

Even by your definition it doesn't need to reach that nonsensical utopia to be deemed communist. Try harder comrade.


Yeah they were on the far right, as the distinguished professor Bill Maher [explains](

You are again setting yourself up for fail. Your critique was based on an absolute "all" which I referenced in the first reply. NAWALT is a standard in red-pill community against this trite critique.


Verily the same change! And no, you're wrong.


And here comes the finest irony, I am not even a red-piller. You should be proud.
edit: as for change:


Working women have already become the tradition, it's time for hope and change, we will march to a glorious patriarchy, comrade!

There is no equality, and whatever little freedom of choice there could've been would require dismantling working women(see my other reply in the thread) and hence feminism.
It's not that hard to grasp when you realize that feminism is primarily a struggle between [two groups of women](

Judging by responses to you, I find it amusing that people on one sub who would see the 'red pill' in one system can't see it another.
Feminism has been lying scum from the start. Man the brute keeping waifu as slave is very old fiction.

Well if women aren't people, who are? And if women should be people but are not, who should they be?
The *all women* is a trite claim, and do you really get that problem with [women having the vote](

You're doing nothing of the sort.


Yes, good.




Because you can't.

What they oppose is that women be working for their husbands.
The venom against it often dressed up as going against "traditional stereotypes", though working women have already become the tradition.

You ran away saying that I didn't make any sense. I pointed out pointedly how I did, and your comeback was "uh yeah ok but I did too". 
You're right, there is no discussing with me.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:04:24


Indeed, and what does it mean? It started from what women want.


Why shouldn't I?


Yes, still better than yours.

By your own calling.
What I think of communism, it's simply a power-grab using claims of equality to provoke the masses to remove the previous elites. 
Communism's utopia is nonsense and Mencius Moldbug's red-pill of ['america is a communist country']( where 'communism has not been yet achieved' is what you and I arguing here.


History moves ever leftward and Stalin banned abortion, today who can do that kind of shit if not some extreme right-wing bigot!
