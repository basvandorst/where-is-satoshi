Oh this dip we all said wasn’t gonna happen? Yeah just bought in at 19.5 like twenty minutes ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:48:39
But I saw in another comment that you think private corps can do anything better than than the government, is this an exception to that thought? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:46:22
I saw and noted. Quick question: do you think private criminal justice system is the way to go? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:41:47
You need to work for cnn/Fox/Vice because they all associate left/right with political parties and it seems they are wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:21:00
If I lean left I shouldn’t be here?  Yeah because I believe in pro choice and legal weed I shouldn’t be allowed to buy crypto?
Use your choice of words more wisely?
The whole left/right shit is used to divide people
I agree with your point tho, Bitcoin should be used as a way to go against the system in hopes of changing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:38:42
Then you need to start campaigning on more than Reddit because there are a lot of wrong people out there
So what’s your opinion on the future of bitcoin and crypto in general 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:08
I thought as an employed american you would have better things to do, like go to work?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:10:41
First step  join r/btc
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:11:56
I thought that is what the fee was for lol. Guess I’ll be going to an exchange quicker than I thought 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:49:52
Could you elaborate on maybe some unpopular opinions of libertarians?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:01:19
I’m not but so far I’m agreeing with most of what your saying. There has to be some catch or unpopular belief within libertarianism which makes it not for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:29:04
go back under the bridge troll
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:33:33
lol wow. It's ok people will look at this and not even take you seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:02:51
so coin base showed a value of 12,867 but when i purchased a 100$ in BC it charged me for the BC rate of  12,936, is this common?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:32
I'm calling you a troll based on your history. Must be fun wasting time on reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:33:51
Summary? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:27:57
In my eyes youre not far right if you believe in those things, and to some it makes you a left leaning liberal, see how these labels and tags can’t really describe a person?    You seem like a free thinker, why be poured into the mold of these titles? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:15:49
lol maybe but i'm thinking a maybe the bitcoinsilver fork?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:36
Yeah guess I missed the memo but happens to get the one where it was to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:41:58
I've heard December 15th brought up a few times here, is something happening this month we should all be aware of?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:12:43
Thanks so much. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:35:38
So all those people at the nfl games that as so upset about the anthem because they are pro government, do you think they identify as right or left? 
I’m all for less government control in certain areas but the way the media characterized the “left and right” I have no choice but to view myself as left. And I feel must people feel the same.  That poor redneck? He views himself as right even tho he thinks church’s should get involved in politics when clearly by your standards is not ok for a right winged person.

@_date: 2017-12-20 13:27:36
He gives you an honest reason for the downvote and you reply with insults. I see who the educated person is.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:27
Thanks? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:43:42
Question of the day. I dropped 1/5 of bank roll at 12.9 and now I’m thinking of holding other 4/5 until after we see what happens with futures 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:53:33
Good for her. I saw chemo and radiation take someone from me faster than the cancer would of, it's good to see people being open about alternative medicine. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:51:22
Could you elaborate? Not sure what that is 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:45
Thanks for feeling my pain. Any hope? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:37:13
What's the max Bitcoin in USD you would keep in coin base? still trying to set up a better wallet but i'm itching to buy now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:55:33
Yeah I’m just trying not to stress in the mean time. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:53:53
I'm more tired of crypto going down/
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:01:58
Thanks for the info. Guess it’s time to do something research. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:40:12
Is there bot to remind me when bit coin drops to 7,000?
Edit: autocorrect 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:43:04
It autocorrected bot to not. Sorry about that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:27:25
Are we gonna see a dip below 10,000 again? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:53:57
Is that possible on coinbase?
