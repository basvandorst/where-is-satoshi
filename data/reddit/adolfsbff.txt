This guy thinks govt. has the peoples interest in mind lmao
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:46:42
Never knew that, thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:02:54
Not even mining fees?
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:50:59
I have btc sent from coinbase that hasn't showed up in wallet and it's been over 24 hrs. Can't even find the hash on the blockchain. I fuckin hate coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:55:15
Does Gemini transfer btc for free like gdax does or do they make you pay the mining fees?
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:17:52
There are over 300 million people in the us. If you pussys would man up this shit wouldn't happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:26:23
A civilized rebuttal is needed to be against theft of my money so that it can be used to kill people all over the world? Fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:11:46
I'm so tired of hearing this retarded argument from people. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:57:09
For the anonymity they provide Id gladly pay up to 25%
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:04:52
Ah revolutions aren't convenient enough for you?
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:27:40
Actually you buy bitcoin from many bitcoin atms' anonymously. Just use a prepaid phone with a wallet not attached to your name.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:26:30
Actually we have atms starting from 6.9%, HOWEVER even at 30% it's worth telling the system to go fuck itself. I've never seen one at 30% ever. Highest I've ever seen was 18%. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:30:56
Shipping info? Lmao
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:27:22
No the joke is that the debate was regarding whether or not you could acquire and spend Bitcoin anonymously(which you can if you're not retarded), not whether you can fuckin shop on amazon anonymously. Now go back to your sandbox. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:10:51
Xrp is faster. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:45:16
Was talking about bitcoin my bad. Litecoin is cool tho.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:41:12
Oh cool so I have to decide between a decentralized unusable coin, or a centralized but usable coin.

It is a bubble, everything is a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:32:05
It's not mainstream. Don't worry you'll know when it's mainstream, cause that'll be when the govt shuts down all the exchanges and the price comes crashing down
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:04:38
Even in your scenario fees would be too high to buy tacos with. You answered nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:59:10
You're right , when Washington was President our taxes weren't always being stolen to fund our Jew overlords and line corrupt politicians' pockets. George Washington isn't the president anymore though. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:39:15
Then buy with money you can afford to lose and expect to lose and go down with the ship if it goes to zero. No gamble no future. Also, Wall Street and stocks can suck a fat dick.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:03:42
Our awesome roads and our awesome hospitals lol. Cause that's where the money goes lmao. It doesn't go to useless wars, to israel, to politicians pockets etc.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:39:26
I'd take BTC for my house too, at this point it's money. Although I'd want a slight markup for the volatility risk.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:18:06
If the internet is gone, then all of us will be off the internet, exactly because it's gone, they need us on the internet, to track us and control us. Without the internet they're also powerless. They depend on us using the internet more then we depend on us using the internet. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:23:46
You better cash out before quantum computing gets here. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:32:21
Some machines require no verification. So you can buy bitcoin anonymously which I'm willing to pay up to 20% Markup for. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:08:33
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:55:16
Can you do geth on this also?
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:01:21
I don't think he's talking about sales tax.

Coinbase is a huge reason why cryptos gained popularity. Also, the odds of losing your money on Coinbase is probably less than the odds you lose your Ledger.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:52:33
I have my btc on Jaxx and they still haven't credited us our BCH and they won't support this, so now I have to decide whether to move my btc to coinbase so I don't get fucked?
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:44:44
Yeah I'm gonna pay $4 in fees for a $2 taco gtfo. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:42:57
Yes, I have first hand experience.
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:46:48
My best friend is gonna ban btc in Germany next week.

You don't know how ridiculously dumb baby boomers are. These are the same people that destroyed the world after all.
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:19:15
Anyone know what Jaxx might do???
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:35:10
If you use Jaxx on ios does that mean you own your own keys?
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:05:22
I store my btc on Jaxx for Iphone, will that suffice? I know nothing sorry.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:56:30
Holocaustcoin ftw 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:36:24
Pretty vague statements, which bitcoin is gonna go higher though? There isn't gonna be one bitcoin after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:39:39
People are willing to pay for anonymity I've used these atms and they're by far not perfect. But it was good enough to use more than once. 10% for anonymity is a bargain. I would never pay that from an ATM that required my ID though. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:17:12
So instead of being fucked out of our money now, we're gonna be fucked in November? Awesome.
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:52:55
What worked? Btc is still gonna fork wtf. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:20:05
Jaxx too
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:06:19
What would happen to all the Bitcoin ATM's if something goes bad in the next couple months(fork or whatever)? Would they have to be reprogrammed? Would they be out of business?
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:41:21
Literally had a private equity money manager today tell me and a few other guys that bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:46:46
Also so they don't have to leave the money on the sites they're gambling on. Put btc in, gamble, then pull the btc out. Bitcoin is being used for many reasons that most people don't even know about. I've even lent cash to people using their btc as collateral. This is just the beginning.
