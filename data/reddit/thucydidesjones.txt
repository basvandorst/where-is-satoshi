This needs to become a meme somehow.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:36:04
That's a bit bizarre and creepy.

I made a thread on this a few weeks ago. They are locking accounts seemingly-randomly. And are not responding to support tickets for 30 days or more. It is absolutely unacceptable. Stop white knighting for Bittrex - the exchange is good but the service is shit and I don't trust them.
Go to Binance.

Can confirm. I had a CL ad up - just went to edit it, option was there and I checked it off. Not huge news, but still cool. This is how adoption goes; slow and steady.

Well there hasn't yet. And their customer support gets back to me within 7 days ALWAYS. So...

I meant something more like Congress outlawing crypto purchases/exchanges (another user posted the other day, Congress is already trying to damage crypto). The IRS is getting involved too. The more institutional powers realize crypto's potential/size, the more they will attempt to strangle it, I think. Hopefully I'm just a pessimist and we'll be OK.

I live near DC and have worked in politics/policy. Maybe it's time to start the first pro-Bitcoin lobby?

Yeah that's another thing. Regardless of the FUD, this train is moving forward whether they like it or not. And it's moving fast. There would have to be a fairly cataclysmic event to turn this around, I hope at least.

Refresh the page and/or log out and re-log in.

I just logged in. It's a bit below 10K on Coinbase. It's rare for the prices to exactly match Coin Market Cap (I don't know if they do an average of biggest exchanges or have some other way of determining USD value). 
Don't worry about it. Buy under $10K :)

This is what I consistently see. Investors and notable people make comments on BTC strictly based on the price fluctuations they've seen. Very few (if any) of these FUDders seem to grasp the technology behind BTC, let alone the fact that there are several hundred companies/organizations working on coins with specific technological purposes. (I'm not saying they're all good or will work as planned, but this movement is bigger than speculation IMO) 
It seems there is very little understanding from those outside of the crypto space, about what's actually happening in the crypto space.

And how do I retrieve the balance from my Silk Road account?
(it's a joke, though I'm sure I had something in there)

Genuine questions from a semi-newcomer to crypto on reddit:
Why is BCH talk allowed on r/btc when there is a dedicated BCH subreddit, and r/btc's description mentions nothing about BCH? Which leads me to my second question, why are there two BTC subreddits?

Thank for this, u/inventfuddyduddy

I received a generic blast email to my Mt.Gox associated email (I don't recall exactly when), but it went to my Spam folder and I didn't see it until several months after it was sent.
If you had a Mt.Gox account when they went bust, I'd imagine you received the email as well. Check Spam/Promotions/Social or other possible email accounts.

Haha, I was semi-joking. But feel free to send me a PM and we can chat or have a call.

I FORGOT ABOUT THAT. I was around then, that was exciting. We all thought Doge was destined for .02 or even .01.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:10:37
Got it, thank you.
