Open source it... everyone can see the code, no one should be a able to cheat. 
Real problem with daily fantasy is when one player submits thousands of randomly selected team/bets in the same pool. This player wins by chance, hence the games are no longer really skill based in huge pools. Create a decentralized system, then figue out how to limit individual participants to one bet each - that seems hard.
***Not against DFS, but they could use some transparency in this regard, its just not in their interest since it increases their rake.

Do we then have to buy waze or buy individual trip directions?

Why? Its not like the price would double overnight. Long term the price would reflect demand for existing bitcoins. Even if a 1 bitcoin can buy an house, you can still use 0.000001 bitcoin to buy a coffee.
