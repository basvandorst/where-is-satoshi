Thank you for posting. I made my first segwit transaction last night using information from your guide.
I paid 505 sat/byte. Electrum to Quadrigacx. It took 30 mins to get 6 confirmations (my transaction was in 503 312).
Segwit is a huge step forward for BTC users and it's adoption is really picking up steam. Thank you to all the devs working on 2nd layer solutions, and keep up the good work!
Long live the King, long live Bitcoin (the real bitcoin, not roger ver scam coin trash).

I agree. As mining rewards are decreased, and as Bitcoin continues to gain adoption, I think this effect will get weaker.


(Also, this effect getting weaker should also decrease Bitcoin's price volatility.)

Excellent analysis, really good post. Your own-comment was also gold:

I've been ripped-off by both shapeshift and changelly. I wouldn't recommend anyone use those types of services.
Instead, use a real exchange like binance or bitfinex. These are much more powerful giving you the option to trade market, limit, and stop-limit.
