Not checking the price on your smartphone is a big step in itself! gg

When I read your "my girlfriend..." I thought you were going to say that she is at a lesbian bar, that you're drunk and from now on you'll hodl ;)
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:47:10
haha, that's as valid as those motivational bullshit memes that say "you will never be younger than now" :)

It's not only the fees that prevent people from using. The price increase rate is a reason as important. Nobody wants to buy pizza for millions anymore. LN can't fix that.

The majority of people in this sub have less than one. It just doesn't matter. The factor of gain/loss is the same.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:48:52
this sounded like a graphic card :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:04:14
actually, if LN ever goes live and used, naming it Bitcoin Cache would be a quite interesting marketing tactic ;)

why was the op deleted?

I dare to say that a +500k users sub cannot look different than this one looks. It's just human nature and how large internet communities tend to become.

Breadwallet is free afaik. What did you purchased?
//I used breadwallet, worked fine and nice for me. It has good review from people here. I would say it is the go to option for iOS.

money from grandma doesn't get to influence price at the current volume.

Great talk, but it kind of didn't answer the question from the audience, which was about the forks, and how the futures market will influence / be influenced by the forkable nature of bitcoin/crypto.

And of course there should be a committee of wisdom that should watch and enforce the rules and those who break them should be publicly named and shamed so that the elite will feel better about themselves. Death to the n00bs, let's centralize the decentralized currency sub!

you can do that on google sheets and it gets updated with live rates.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:06:53
=GoogleFinance("CURRENCY:BTCUSD")   this formula will get you live rate for btc to usd in sheets.
there are extra params for historical data, and a lot of other cool stuff you can do

I know that feeling, congrats!
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:40:32
that's nice. however I don't remember the 7k-3k you're talking about.

Most of the current demographics has trouble understanding  even basic Internet, forget crypto. Time will solve this problem.

I saw some fb ads for "Dirty Coin" which will supposedly revolutionize the adult industry. Didn't check it out but there are clearly iniatives in this direction :)

this article claims the end of digital gold rush because of this.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:21:22
looks like a bug. but do charge your phone :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:15:07
so a bitcoin will worth 1M of crashed dollars?

If you only need to see price and current trend, you can use default stock app on your iPhone. It works without even unlocking your phone. Just swap right.
