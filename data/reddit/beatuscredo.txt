I have been watching crypto news all day. I Have been wondering curiously why BCH going up and btc is going down and what the correlation could be. I have been trying to sell BCH since the news broke about coinbase. I have not been able to execute my transaction. 
So are you trying to say “anyone could have done this” except for me?
To me the evidence is stating nobody could have done it unless you were inside the insider trading loop.

You placed sells and executed? That’s my issue here. I know of one confirmed sell at 5k and it is ironically charlie Lee.

Insider trading. Complete disaster.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:29
Ironic charlie Lee was able to pull the trigger
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:33
I’m not sure what you want me to interpret from this. 
Did you make any BCH trades on gdax or coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:12
This tweet proves my point...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:25
Nope just simply less centralization.

Illegal Insider trading 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:54
None of what you just posted is true at all lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:44
Insider trading. Complete disaster. Charlie Lee also involved.

Can someone explain the valuation method used to determine how much 1 BCH is worth?

Incredible reference

Bank execs are publicly begging governments to get involved. There is no evidence of a bubble. There is plenty of evidence of btc being undervalued (even at $10k). 
The competition is real and the disruption has begun.

governments.... Bitcoin does not have a military.

Understood, but in the event someone leaves their coins in Coinbase during the fork, they will only have BTC and not BCH.
If that is true, will BCH know what coins made the migration and which coins did not?
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:48:00
How will BCC know which coins made it over and which coins did not (ie left within coinbase) and thus how will BCC be able to establish the market cap relative to the # of coins in circulation?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:31:53
how will Bitcoin Cash account for coins that are lost in the fork?
right now we know that the market cap / the amount of coins in circulation = roughly the value of one bitcoin. 
How will Bitcoin Cash accurately know how many coins are in circulation and how many are coins were lost during the fork?
Also how will they account for coins that lay dormant?
