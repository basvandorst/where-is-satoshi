Well, if you look at 
the transactions have already been spent, so you wouldn't be able to buy any coin from that block (unless you want to fork....)

Congrats on the wedding and congrats on having a bitcoin ATM near your place!

Though, having only a single peer might be unsafe... Sibyl attack.

Encoded in UTF-8, it can vary from 140 to 560.

DC to DC converters(voltage regulators) aren't really that efficient either.

Ah yes, I'm sorry. Indeed, most of English text can be represented in 7-bit ASCII.

Hey, it's both our cake day today. :3

Hashing *is* deterministic though.
\\-/(x,y). x = y --&gt; H(x) = H(y)
@_date: 2016-05-10 09:05:03
Can you explain what you mean by that to me?
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:29:02
He's already in his radar though.

If I found out the identity of my long lost pen pal and someone who &gt;170k people are curious to know, I'd be damn well excited to proclaim that. But that's just me.

Isn't he getting himself involved though, by saying to the public "lol, cw fucked up and he cant fool me"

@_date: 2016-05-11 22:42:26
Thanks for the thorough explanation.
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:29:18
The difference is that the guy was already in his radar from the start.

If you change fingerprint to hash(which is exactly what a fingerprint is), it actually makes sense.
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:33:10
Can you show me an example of the first clause? From what I've seen, a fingerprint is a hash of one's public key. Basically a toned-down signature of a public key.

It's exactly because we're a disorganized infighting rabble that we're the ultimate bullshit detectors.
@_date: 2016-05-08 08:16:26
I see, thanks! I learned more.
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:48:28
Someone already did though.
