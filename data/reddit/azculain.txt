I always suspected he was an Ivory Tower economist. Jay Clayton his SEC chief is the same way. But people in the Crypto space hate Libra anyway and all hes doing is helping them accumulate over time by trying to regulate a market that can't be regulated. A lot of his central banking pals hate it because its an asset class that they can't control, not hinged on the value or devaluation of the dollar, if anything it will skyrocket if the market crashes. Then you have people dumping massive wealth into Securities and CDPs, untaxed wealth all over the place, what a nightmare for them :/

All of them are funny but Wage Cuckin' it cracks me up every time.

At this point you will have to put it in space in a few years everyone will have negative interest rates.

Look anything is better than an exchange, cold storage or hardware is best but use a Desktop wallet like Eidoo if you have to, but these exchanges are notorious for losing your funds usually when the market is tanking or the price goes through the roof, mysterious how that happens eh.

I'm not saying that, I mean you are, I'm not.
I'm guessing that wouldn't be a very popular proposal for all out war with Iran, cuz Bitcoins. 
And even if that scenario were to play out in that way the value still goes up.

I don't always agree with Iran but if it fucks the Central banking mafia, I am all in.

I'm gonna laugh if it crashes to 3k overnight.

Honestly it would just make it more valuable and when web 3.0 is out it won't matter anyway the US can regulate until they are blue in the face.

Stole is probably more accurate.

Considering you make around 1% profit on Gas alot of his overhead must be paid for maybe hes liquidating that store, selling as much out of date cheap stuff as he can and gtfo with as much Bitcoin as possible.

 Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

Some of the ATMs like Coinflip and a few others dont ask for ID at under 1000 dollars or so. Then its just a matter of either sending it to an Xchange address or Wallet address depending on if you want to swap it for altcoin or not. Plus I pay in cash that way, gotta keep those tracers off.

The Global war with Iran, that I won't be fighting.
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:34:23
War, negative interest rates incoming, I am also sure once in a lifetime buy it now deals are lurking somewhere. I can see it now, interest rates a problem invest that money into property, we at such and such bank will loan what you need no problem after all its your money anyway hahahhaaa.

Follow Manuel, just in case.
@_date: 2019-09-18 12:58:33
ETA on negative interest rates?
@_date: 2019-09-02 12:33:33
In the neighborhood of 60,000 if he wanted, if he doesn't give half his fortune away first.

A lot of banks block the purchase of bitcoin, mark them as untrusted etc. Sure it's the same for Credit cards had the issue myself so you can either use an ATM or use a pay as you go card.
