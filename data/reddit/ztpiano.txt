I don't think it is sensationalism.  Volatility is extremely dangerous to bitcoins long-term value.  Keep in mind that bitcoin isn't supposed to be an investment for people to get rich off of, it's supposed to be a currency.  If it has swings of over 60% of it's value within a single day it is not a good currency.  If it is not a good currency, it is worthless.
The temporary loss in bitcoin value during the crashes aren't what scare me.  What scares me is the fact that the crashes themselves make bitcoin seem like a bad currency.  If enough people decide that bitcoin is a bad currency, it will lose its value in the long-term.

That quote says that we don't know who created bitcoin.  And that is true.  We don't know who created the bitcoin system.
Paraphrasing this statement as saying "How do we even know that someone can't make more?" is more misleading and blatantly false than anything in the article you're criticizing.

uhhh ok...
i mean, you're right... it's just a little bit of a random statement

i'm sure it will settle closer to 50$ than 150$ but OK.
it's a really strange idea to pretend you live in a hypothetical world where you are ignorant to the wild fluctuations and crashes of your investments.  we'll see how it works out for you i guess.
