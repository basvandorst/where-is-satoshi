Can someone link me to the bitcoin prophecy?

What’s the Asuka prophesy
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:45:07
What is meant by this?

Bruh I’m kidding... his name was Satoshi for petes sake

Let me hold a bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-12 07:25:47
Yeah it is! I’m the owner!

Bitcoin currently has 65%+ crypto dominance. I believe that Bitcoin will be the most successful crypto currency, unless something else comes out that shocks the world.

Man I wish you did! I can’t wait for our first transaction. It might take a few weeks, unfortunately.

Lol @ everyone who sold at 10K thinking it was going to dip immediately
@_date: 2019-08-12 21:14:14
But I’ll definitely consider that!
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:30:08
Literally this...
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:50:45
This is so weird
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:37:58
We back muh fckas
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:36:04
Honestly I thought it was going to dip at 10k but I decided not to sell and got lucky
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:14:44
You know what would be insane? If bitcoin reached 16k by the end of October.. that’ll confirm the prophesy lol
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:19:27
I always had faith
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:15:53
Coinbase pro is good

I meant 52 Week high at the time.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:53:39
We’re still up 35% on the year
