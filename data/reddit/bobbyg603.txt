Right! You could also tie an address to your license plate number I'm sure someone would be willing to run that service.

The other day someone gave me plenty of room when I attempted to change lanes in heavy traffic. Would've gladly bought them coffee.

Bitcoin is going to the moon or it's going close to zero. I believe in the moon but I also believe in hedging your bets.

Put away 21 for him. 1 in a million club!

Well, that assumes that Bitcoin is an efficient market. According to investopedia that means "A market has to be large and liquid. Accessibility and cost information must be widely available and released to investors at more or less the same time." I'd argue that neither point there is true of Bitcoin at current so don't rule out the moon just yet ;)

Someone with a lot of money invested in bitcoin invested more into bitcoin. He knew people would get excited and pump up the price only to be disappointed when mr.moneybags starts to dump his bitcoin.
Edit: the morale of the story? Buy doge

Bitcoin ftw! Gave ~88k bits to the red cross using changetip &amp; Twitter the other day. I felt so 2015! Haha

Chinese investors were over leveraged.

This. Additionally automatic monthly buys of each over time is a better idea than sinking it all in at once

If I could hail a self driving Tesla and pay with Bitcoin I'd be so happy...

Most of the volume is CNY not USD so I don't think $1000 USD will be as big a deal as your post suggests

I was thinking of trying something similar fwiw. I think bitcoincash.org offers a client that you can use.

I have such a clue right now

Isn't having only one blockchain a form of centralization? I thought part of the power of bitcoin was that it was open source so anyone can start a blockchain. If a destructive party gains control of a single blockchain we need numerous alternatives :)
