no? if the expected ROI is greater than the interest on your loan, then it's smart to leverage your debt that way
this is basic stuff

I have no idea what this post means. Can anyone explain?

I'm a bit confused by what you mean "against the exchange". Do you mean against the broker? You mean your broker actually make trades against your trades and hope you fail? They never actually execute your trades in the market and just wait for you to bankrupt and then they collect your account? That's pretty funny.
 I day trade a bit myself and net gains on average. No reasonable trader would make a trade risking more than 1 to 2% of his account at once, so the margin is generally regarded as irrelevant from what I understand. It certainly wouldn't affect my trades.
edit: Also I forgot to ask how this is relevant to the statement that the forex has a trading volume roughly 200 times that of the NYSE.

Because that's not how bubbles work. The bubble will burst, and the value might drop from 100 to 5, but that doesn't mean bitcoin will die. Look at Amazon through the dotcom bubble: peaked at 107 before falling all the way to 7, but is now at over 260.

Wouldn't these be tier 3 circumventions?

You're talking about [perfect competition]( a market that is too big for any participant to direct it. The closest thing in the world is the [foreign exchange]( which has a trading volume of around 200 times that of the New York Stock Exchange, but even the forex can be manipulated by central banks (aka the richest men in the world). So, unfortunately, no, there is no volume at which it will be unmanipulable by the elite.
This is quite obvious, actually, when you realize that the elite own more than 50% of the world's assets. Naturally nothing can be too big for them given that.

What do you mean by this?
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:03:35
I'm not sure why you said that in response to me, but it was a good post, so here's an upvote.
To be clear, my response to you was merely a comment on




I disagreed semantically with your use of the word "corruption".

What is the definition of "old"? Is that based on time, or is it based on the number of transactions made? And is this just a client problem? I thought a certain number of latest transactions were held by every user of bitcoins or something?


What is the size of the chain based on? Is it the number of trades within a time range?

How the fuck could that kill bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:05:06


wut? Of course the broker is making the asks and bids, that's the point of the broker. If you were doing your own trades, you wouldn't use a broker.


I'd hope no one thinks they're holding yen/euros. When you open an account, it's with dollars. You trade with other currencies, but those are just positions, all profit goes into your account as dollars.


I'm not following why the broker would need to do this. They make their profit off of the spread, or less commonly, a commission. Why would they need their clients to lose money?

Scams are not corruption by the common use of the term. Corruption refers to people of power abusing that power. The central banks which control fiat currencies are corrupt, and bitcoins by nature can not be corrupted in that way.

Indeed. It is much to the point that even if the dollar "collapses", it will not necessarily lose value, because the USA has a military. For example, the military can be used to force people to trade with us at a fixed price, thus forcing the value of the dollar to be higher than it should be.
Similarly, the bitcoin could be influenced by real world assets.

Wow, is this a non-trivial concern? That's horrific limitation. As je8du39 said, this would be a massive problem if the bitcoin were traded on the forex. The trading volume of bitcoin would increase by several orders of magnitude above its current level.
Can you elaborate on exactly how much harddrive space we're talking about here?

He could have said "A" and "B", and it'd have made no difference. Why are you shitting up this comment thread with your meaningless, flimsy nitpicking?
To put it another way, you're claiming that his argument is invalid *because the names he used for his examples offend you.* Wow. A common logical fallacy: Appeal to being a whiny bitch.

The point he/she is making is that bitcoins are going through hyper deflation atm, which means it's a far better investment to hold on to your bitcoins than to spend them. The more people hold on to them, the more they are worth, it's self perpetuating. No one wants to spend their bitcoins because it'd be a bad investment.

Not necessarily, at least not for more than a couple years. We have the technological capability today to do two things: Supply the world's energy needs with renewable energy, and handle almost all labor with robotics and AI.
