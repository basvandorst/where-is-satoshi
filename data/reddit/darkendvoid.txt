Full disclosure I have around $1800 invested in them right now. (1,530 left till ROI)
1. Josh promises that you'll soon be able to do whatever you could do with physical miner at your house with the hashlets. Hopefully some more transparency will happen with this.
2. I have free hosting for most of my hashlets (converted hardware) so not quite in that boat but again "promises" that hashlets will reduce in maintenance as more data centers are set up and existing hardware is replaced with more power efficient systems.  
I personally take this claim with a grain of salt, power is only so cheap so there has to be a point where you can no longer reduce costs.
3. Hopefully the promises in point 1 will address this concern, personally I'm still paying myself back the fiat I used to fund all this so getting BTC doesn't matter to me as I cash out on every spike and pay myself back.  
Once I reach ROI I'll probably be more concerned about keeping what I'm mining for cold storage.

I'll tip my bourbon in Frankie's honor.

Indie folk and grassroots country are your last holdouts, everything else is commercialized for the masses *sigh*

Plz no, this is Sungha Jung, jwcfree on YouTube, he's 20 and has been making YouTube videos for 10 years, one of the most talented musician / arrangement composers I've heard in my lifetime. I'm just ready to fly to the moon and play among the stars : )

Awesome poster, I'm doing my part and running a UASF 148 node currently on a WD Enterprise RE4 300gb drive. Should the block chain expand above that I guess I'll have to invest in an SSD for that box but the electricity costs and internet costs were already allocated to other things so it's no sweat off my back.

So unrelated, as an avid r/homelab and hows the 6100 working out for you? I was really curious with both the 6100 and 6220 as an upgrade to my previous 4U R905 that I had downsized to a R805. I wanted to dabble in hyperconvergence and HA clusters but was debating between the C6 series and 4-6 R210ii for roughly the same pricing as a 6220 but I would be getting 4 nodes out of a 6100 for the price of 2 R210's
Edit: So I realized you were directly replying to the cost prohibitive portion of my statement, and yes I absolutely agree!!  
Note for all:    
r/homelab is a great resource for anyone looking to buy 2nd hand server equipment on the cheap. Between what I scrounge free from work and buy on fleabay you can find yourself with extremely powerful servers for pennies on the dollar, especially early model DDR3 systems even if you're not getting stuff for free. OOW (out of warranty) devices from enterprise groups that have long surpassed their ROI are cheaper than you think.

Awesome, my R905 was an 800w beast but AMD and their blah blah cool and quiet kept power usage realistic for a 4 socket, my R805 is only dual socket 6 cores but they do what I need even at DDR2 speed (although memory bandwidth is limiting my 10G SAN backbone to 6.4G). Everyone says go R series for ddr3 but nobody bought the R series which I want for my collection of AMD systems.

You're absolutely right, but a few cents extra a day on an already used 24/7 machine with more than 150GB free disk space is negligible in overall costs. 
In my case my machine was already mining alt coins, the extra 3.5W HDD holding the chain data is negligible. Honestly a few cents extra cost a day is worth it to me to run a full node, now if you don't get OOW free equipment from work and are purchasing machines then yes it is cost prohibitive.

1100Gb usage to start a node, 300MB ram, and 137GB disk space.
I'm not sweating the costs-
