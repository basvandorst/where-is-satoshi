Hey guys I’m a noob. I only have coinbase right now. Is there an app (IOS) that does instant transactions and will let me use the same wallet? (eventually hardware wallet)
Couldn’t find a gdax app. 
Also I’d have to deposit money and wait for it to clear before I can buy right?

Can someone point me where I can learn more about this "lightning" that I keep hearing about?

Thanks I do plan on staying so I will check that out. I'm on mobile at the moment so will do so later.
Do you know if it describes how to read the green and orange walls? Or anywhere I can read about it in lamens terms?
Thanks again

So I didn’t have any cash sitting in my coinbase. I bought in at 11,600 through my linked bank account and I understand it’ll take a few days to transfer. 
Am I locked in at 11,600?

I started out with coinbase, and bought BTC from gdax for first time.
Shouldnt those coins show up in my coinbase wallet or does it take a while? Thanks

Wow thanks a lot for that. looking forward to doing some reading up.

What’s the benefit of buying from someone?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:59:36
ah ok. Thank you for explaining 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:54:15
Do you know what that sub is?

coinbase has fucked me so many times, i've missed out on buying opportunities watching the price go way back up as the site and app arent functional.
