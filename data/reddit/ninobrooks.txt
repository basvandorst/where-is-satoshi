Absolutely right and wdaniels has it, too. The Rock's support is amazing. They're nice, they're fast, and they're thorough. Over and over and over again I've come to them with questions or problems and they get 5/5 stars from me every single time.
BangAz, you forgot to mention they're one of the first exchanges to provide ripple support which, in speed and cost, beats the bleeding brakes off of egopay, okpay, paypal (kudos to virwox for supporting that), and wire transfer in addition to allowing users to buy/sell across multiple exchanges in many currencies. This means it's far faster and more affordable for anyone to trade on The Rock than Kraken, Cryptsy, BTC-e, etc.
I re-iterate: The Rock's support, as you can see from others here, is hands-down amazing.

You pretty much answered your own question. Ripple does this, transferring value by debit across the network (and doing currency conversion from endpoint-to-endpoint on the fly). Stellar *claims* to do this but *at this writing* it's just another shitcoin with a lot of buzz and a web client instead of a QT client (but we can hope!).
Is there anybody doing it with BTC? Doing what, exactly? Taking X currency, changing it to Bitcoin, transferring the value via Bitcoin and spitting out at the other end as X currency? 1) BTC too slow for that. If a coin, I would use DOGE. 2) This IS an interesting idea. All you'd need is two endpoints similar to ripple gateways, who accept other currencies and send BTC, and who accept BTC and pay out other currency. Still, Ripple does this better.
Why work with BTC when companies like Ripple and Stellar...
Exactly. And Ripple does it in 2-20 seconds. The advantage bitcoin would have is being trustless, but it's not trustless if you have to use a third-party as above.
I'm sorry, you're sorry. :D

Log in, turn it off. Then turn it on again but FIRST save the secret seed (character sequence under/near the qr code). When you re-install your 2fa, enter the seed.

Poop and Lies. Prove it.

Disable 2fa. That means log in, go to settings, and turn it OFF.
Now you can see the QR code and the secret seed again. Screenshot the whole thing because you can manually enter the secret seed or scan the QR code. So save it, scan it, turn 2FA on. Tada! When you restore your phone and install authenticator, scan the screenshot or enter the seed.

So far, legit. I sent a dollar. :D

Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Paypal transactions are reversible. Bitcoin vendors can be easily screwed by Paypal clients so they are hard to find.
As others have mentioned, VirWox can do it but you're going to lose 5% (paypal's vendor fee passed on to you). If you don't have a bank account, that's pretty much your only choice except a friend with Bitcoin.
While it may take time, Paypal-&gt;bank-&gt;coinbase.com is pretty much as simple as it gets for now.

There are other methods to transfer Fiat which are not reversible like PayPal. Ripple, for example. He can Use snapswap.Us as his American gateway for withdrawal.

transactions can happen off the blockchain but you can also buy bitcoin and send it to a btc address.

" An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency... for any reason is a money transmitter "
So pure crypto exchanges are also MSBs, since before anyone was really paying attention, looks like.

I haven't really checked out multisig so I can only say, after a glance, "that sounds good" lol
I sent a dollar and tried to call out some friends on Twitter to do the same in order to highlight Bitcoin's edge in micropayments vs PayPal/CC. I might do it every day for a week and see if it gets a ball rolling.
So, what are you suggesting?

You could also keep USD in an exchange, buy bitcoin as needed.
