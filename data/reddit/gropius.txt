All the risks to investing in these unregulated shares are pretty well laid out in the overview.  Notably:

**Are you willing to publish the details of your method?**  Can you prove you or your users won't be violating iOS's end-user licence?  What specifically prevents Apple from changing the backend protocol and issuing an iOS update to render your store useless and uninstall/disable the apps installed by it?
If I was an iOS user **and paying for apps**  I would want some concrete assurance that Apple wouldn't some day lock down the mechanism you're using to achieve this I'd lose what I've paid for.
I'd ask similar questions before putting BTC against apps on Kindle/Amazon devices, or any other "walled garden" application models.
This is more a knock on OS providers' approach of control over end devices rather than your efforts (a BTC-based Play alternative for Android, for instance, seems doable and would be welcome).  
I'm just a bit skeptical.

I was amazed at the amount of hate and virulence [in this post's comment thread]( in a normally pretty cool and emotionally detached .
My personal guess is that there are a lot of people (especially on reddit) who had heard about Bitcoin before the price shot up late last year -- but didn't get in for whatever reason.   These people "could have been rich" but they weren't, and just sat there watching the price skyrocket, kicking themselves and wallowing in self-loathing and/or envy on those who did get in.
Now when the price takes a hit, these people can feel vindicated that they didn't get in on what they now perceive as "a bad thing"...and want to transfer their previous self-directed feelings of loathing and inadequacy onto those they envied before to "take 'em down a notch"...and gleefully mock any BTC chaos or hit of panic with vigorous gusto! 
Of course the anti-bitcoiners *may* eventually be proven "right"...and they still would have "been rich" had they gotten in even if BTC had stayed at crash-low levels.  But it feels good to disprove yourself wrong, even if it's over a small, localized and temporary thing.
Also, as an aside, the "lunatic fringe" of bitcoin enthusiasts is very visible and easily mocked/dismissed/hated on.  The sane and level-headed end up getting painted with the same brush.
**TL;DR:  It's people trying to reverse their own butthurt ?**

&lt;political pov alert&gt;
When I think of "infiltration to destroy" I think of the modern [US Republican Party \(GOP\)](  
They've done a pretty good job joining the Federal government in order to lessen its effectiveness.
However, ironically perhaps, the [Tea Party]( has recently done something very similar to the GOP! 
&lt;/political pov alert&gt;
I'll grant that either of these examples indicate a complete dismantling, but rather a significant degree of disruption.

I have yet to be convinced -- I feel the security issues around Bitcoin are still  too great a concern for the average person wishing to transfer significant sums to BTC.  
People believe, for better or for worse, that banks are safe.  If they didn't, they wouldn't deposit their paychecks directly into them, etc.  I believe people are also generally techno-phobic and would not be interested in hearing about why and how to secure their own bitcoins independently.  
Given this, I don't see any real barrier or disincentive for any Internet-era bank to not provide a "BTC storage" facility.   "You give us your bitcoins, we'll guarantee to keep 'em safe, and you can make any withdrawal to your personal wallet at any time via our online banking system."  **The infrastructure for this is already in place, from Citibank down to your local credit union!**
Once a bank has a stockpile of their peacefully sleeping clients' BTC, there's then no reason for them to not start offering a "Bitcoin Loan" service on the other side.  Jane and John Doe would like a few BTC to buy a new Tesla...well looky here their own bank is willing and able to slide them a juicy BTC loan with a better interest rate than for an equivalent sum in fiat!
And then the age old story of unregulated (non-central) fractional reserve banking story with all of its chapters including Inflation and Banking Panic would be re-written in BTC, would it not?  
If your average person is not going to care to understand how to secure their own bitcoins, would they be any more inclined to care about their own bank's BTC reserves (ostensibly what a Audit the Coinbase movement would reveal)?  The banks could always say "hey, we need to pay for securing your BTC somehow, and we have *so much bitcoin* that a 25% reserve is safe for all of our depositors."  
I Want To Believe, but this is the main flaw in the "BTC as currency paradise" thinking for me at the moment.  I'm welcome to hear arguments to the contrary...

I would suggest using [localbitcoins.com]( instead.  Find a highly rated online seller in your area/country that uses a payment method you're comfortable with.  
You probably won't get the absolute best rate but you will end up with some BTC to play with.

At the open house I:
* Used a Bitcoin "ATM" to trade € for BTC.  Worked slick, but the exchange rate seemed pretty poor even though one guy said it was updated dynamically according to the Bitstamp price.
* Made my ***first physical purchase*** with Bitcoin!  A mug with the Bitcoin logo on it.
* Talked to some guy about [USB "smartcard" based wallets](  I'm not really convinced, but it's an interesting idea.
* Saw some seemingly operational mining rigs.  Yawned, but it's not really my thing.
* Skipped over a stand featuring a well-known wallet...Electrum? Most people seemed to be doing likewise.
* Observed a few inquisitive folks (including some journalist types) asking basic questions about Bitcoin, mixed in with a pretty impressive crowd of techie-looking types who you would assume were already BTC-savvy.   The atmosphere was friendly, open and fairly lively, abuzz with people posing questions and sharing ideas.  And this was before drinks were served!
As mentioned elsewhere, it's not an exchange, not a "BTC bank," rather it seemes like it will be a sort of "incubator space" for BTC-related companies &amp; start-ups.  
Glad I stopped by.

The idea is that the Cypriots are looking for banking alternatives after being [forced to take/threatened with a Euro haircut]( by the traditional banking system.
BEE/NEO  introduced a bank based on "full" reserves in BTC and a supporting credit card system + Euro transfer mechanism for purchases and every-day transactions.
Not everybody is going to be bitcoin-savvy enough to put their savings in cold storage and trade on BTC exchanges to convert between bitcoin and local currency, so NEO/BEE would provide a familiar "bank" + CC structure to bridge the gap.
Seemed like an idea with a decent chance to catch on.

I take your first three points on security but I would still suggest that *most* consumer fiat assets worldwide are held by people who trust their banks (I would imagine that most of these assets are actually *deposited in these banks* but I don't have any facts to back this claim up).  For Bitcoin to be the successful fiat alternative of the future, people holding these assets would need to be convinced that BTC is a better (including safer) place to store their money. 


This is the crux of it for me.  Security in general **is** quite difficult to get right, and it will keep you up at night.  Most people just pay someone some amount to provide a *perceived* level of security -- and from what I read here on I don't see any BTC security schemes that are anywhere close to truly addressing the problem.  
I'm sorry, but saying "hey, don't worry it's getting better, we'll figure it out eventually" seems to me defies the whole bitcoin concept, which is a 10-page PDF one can read and understand in all of its elegant, revolutionary glory.   Similarly, [PGP]( was a technological masterstroke, but it is not used for what its inventors intended it to be used for (i.e. everyone sending PGP'd messages to everyone else) because the trust aspect of public key identity/security is a **non-technical problem that is very difficult to solve**.   
Bitcoin has enjoyed a much greater popular success for what it was meant to be used for than PGP, and I don't see it going away any time soon.   But I fear that the dream in which it is a panacea for fiat currency drawbacks is just unrealistic.  I can easily see BTC replacing money wire services and credit card networks and becoming the preferred method for payment over the Internet. Which is **huge**.  But assuming that happens,  barring a security silver bullet, I think Bitcoin is even more likely to become a fractional reserve banking instrument -- and if so, it will not be fun to witness the first "run on Bitcoin" that would happen, of course, when least expected.


And like I was trying to say, banks would not necessarily need to agree to having 100% reserves available at any time for people to deposit their bitcoin.  In fact, they could pay you interest to keep your BTC in their "super secure" bitcoin account (where they then turn around and loan 75% of your deposit out at a higher rate, but what's that to you?) as opposed to *you* paying a Bitcoin storage company to squirrel your BTC 100% away, intact and in cold storage.  Sure, some people will prefer the latter, but it would be pretty tempting to have your BTC earn interest while it was stored away, wouldn't it?

Thanks for sharing!  Great explanation.  
I work on the technical side of the investment banking industry, and while I probably couldn't trade to save my life, I am familiar with a lot of the concepts (for equities at least).  
Some of the comments here are shocking in their naiveté (SHORT SELLING IS FRAUD!) but then I've already been exposed to the wild and wooly world of financial instruments -- most people have no idea of what goes on.  
Just like most people who own computers have no idea about the detail that goes into, say, programming them, most people who use money have no idea about the details of what goes on in the financial system.   
Bitcoin FX trading can be seen as a learning experience in this case -- I'm amazed at how easy it is to set up an account and begin *margin* trading with low amounts for small fees -- but I think things are going to get **really hairy** when the Big Boys on Wall Street and The City turn their eyes toward BTC trading and start applying the full force of their sophisticated trading techniques to bitcoin.  That's the price you'll pay if you want BTC to "grow up" into a proper, widely used currency.  Or commodity.  Or whatever it is.
**TL;DR:** The head scratching has only begun.

Excellent point.

The other reason people put gold in banks is to secure it.    Instead of building a super secure vault and managing how and where to keep the keys for it secret, you offload the responsibility to someone  with a strong and guarded vault.  You exchange the difficulty of managing security yourself for trust in a reputable organization that manages it for not only you, but all of their other clients as well.
Managing proper bitcoin security yourself is, if not difficult, I would argue inconvenient...which is going to be a barrier for the average person.  The average person already trusts their bank and the banks all have internet banking software *in place* that could be adapted to handle bitcoin balances.  
If mass adoption of BTC ever happens, and unless someone discovers a simple, convenient personal bitcoin security solution for the average person, I think that it's quite likely that the banks will step in to fill the gap.   
To cater to people concerned about fractional reserve, banks could provide an account that is verifiable on the blockchain, but then they would charge a premium for this service.  I don't think your average person will care if banks turn around and lend their vaulted BTC ,  and might even like to see some interest on their magical Internet money in return.
**TL;DR:** I suggest that security concerns could drive a widely adopted BTC into fractional banking.

Well I'll be waiting to see those details, then!


Good luck with that -- I doubt patents really matter here or are going to offer you any real protection, especially against the big patent pool holders.


Have I missed the whole point, which was to allow devs to get paid (via BTC txns) for apps offered in your store?  


But one of your main pitches is that your method will work on an un-jailbroken phone.  I have to say the BTC store idea sounds much more feasible for jailbroken devices.
**My two cents:**  I read a lot of "trust" phrases in your responses such as "I can promise you,"  "I can assure you," etc etc.  The fact is that you can't, not without providing evidence.  Overusing phrases like this can degrade your level of trustworthiness, especially on an anonymous forum like Reddit.  You seem gifted, ambitious and enthusiastic and I wouldn't want to take any of that away from you, but if you're trying to convince people about an idea, let the idea and your work -- rather than words that anyone can toss around -- do the promising.  
Just some unsolicited advice from an anonymous geezer on the interwebs, take it for what it's worth.

Excellent.  I was pleased when Louis C.K. went "pay what you want, no DRM" and supported this decision by buying the first special he released on the website.  However, the lousy payment options available at the time (Paypal and Amazon I think) tarnished the whole experience for me.
Adding a Bitpay is a huge step forward IMHO.  I just purchased two specials -- it was "instantaneous (though I still don't quite know how Bitpay hasn't been stung by confirming payment via unconfirmed txns),"  simple, convenient, and there was no need to hook into a cumbersome 3rd-party middleman payment system.
It's interesting that you can't simply pay on louisck.net with just a credit card, which I think would be the most straightforward for most people.  Some Louis C.K. fans looking to buy a special *just might* see Bitcoin in a more favorable light after checking out the option available on the site.

I propose simply following the metric system to avoid making an already complicated subject not any more complicated.  Your tongue can handle saying it, and the math is simple for even the uninitiated.
*  1 BTC is "one bitcoin" or "one Bee Tee Cee"
*  1 mBTC is "one millibitcoin" or "one milli Bee Tee Cee"
*  1 µBTC is "one microbitcoin" or "one micro Bee Tee Cee"
I don't think there's any need to abbreviate -- in English "bitcoin" has the same number of syllables as "meter," "liter," and "second." 
If colloquialisms like "Emm BTC" or "You BTC" enter into the language, so be it, they're unambiguous just like "kay gee" for kg or "emm ell" for ml are unambiguous. 
It's unfortunate IMHO that the Satoshi does not correspond to a BTC x 10^3n "metric-like" division and personally I think it should be relegated to talking about limits to the protocol rather than talking about BTC amounts. 
If anyone asks "I've heard about a Satoshi, what/how much is it?" you can respond" a Satoshi is the smallest Bitcoin division currently allowed by the Bitcoin network.  One Satoshi equals 1/100 of a  microbitcoin." and leave it at that.  
In any case, trying to settle on a colloquial name for the current BTC "usable amount" is futile while the exchange rate is so volatile.  Let's wait for the price in fiat to stabilise within an single order of magnitude for six months to a year before we start thinking about a cute nickname for 1/10^k BTC.

You're welcome.  I thought about replying with a "Well done!" but coughing up some BTC seemed like a more appropriate response.
