Banks tracking your transactions is like bitcoin exchanges tracking your transactions with them. Bitcoin that stays P2P is fundamentally different than bitcoin that runs through third parties or intermediaries. 
Traceability leads to blacklisting and blacklisting leads to merchants/recipients verifying your coins through a black list database. Imagine if every time you accepted some paper cash you had to scan it through a USD-verify app on your mobile phone. It would be like that.

Of course, I don't want to change the 21 million Bitcoin cap; I'm just saying that in the not-to-distant future some one will attempt it. One doesn't have to own BTC in order to propagate bitcoin software.

Hyperledger and Wall Street are perfect for each other. Multiple private ledgers (blockchains) equal multiple versions of the truth.

The basic problem with his line of thinking is that "bitcoin" the currency cannot be separated from "Bitcoin" the network, because the incentive system provides for maximum computational power going into the leading and strongest blockchain. That is its brilliance....and yeah, it happens to be slightly political in its effect.

 That was great to read that bitcointalk post from Satoshi. Thanks for linking. Also, thank you for engaging on this important topic.
I don't intend to mislead anyone and my statements on how the block chain works were merely based on the current default reference implementation, which has majority of the market share today but obviously can change in the future (as can the base unit). 
When it comes to XBT and where to set the decimal, I don't think there is a right or wrong answer -- it's a matter of perception and managing trade-offs and people will sit at different places along that spectrum.
So, here are my detailed reasons for maintaining XBT as a one full bitcoin (1.00000000):
a) We get one shot at setting XBT and minor units within the ISO standards body, so we should not base a plan around what makes "visual" sense at the time (Zimbabwe did not keep going to the ISO for re-pegging as they massively added zeroes. If gold goes to $10,000 per ounce would you recommend adjusting base unit to grams?);
b) The white paper from Satoshi references 21 million as a finite limit for bitcoin issuance. Although he entertains adjusting commas and decimal displays in his post, the public perception and the 21 million limit has taken on a greater importance with the financial world than initially realized. Changing it now would undermine those perception gains. Moving the decimal point to bits would change the finite limit to 21 trillion "bits" or 2.1 quadrillion "satoshis" definitely not inspiring to the economic notion of scarcity (CNBC TV quacks will say the new limit for bitcoin is now 21 trillion!);
c) For better or worse, pricing in currency units implies relative scarcity of that unit. Italy was constantly ridiculed when it required 2,000,000 lira to purchase an everyday household item. They are not the only example. Sure, a newbie can acquire more bits, but it trivializes the pricing mechanism;
d) XBT is already quoted as 1.00000000 on respected forex sites, such as XE.com, Bloomberg, Reuters Eikon, and CNN. Even Oanda.com quotes it this way although they still use BTC. Moving to a "bits" expression would start to make bitcoin (XBT) a joke currency like Dogecoin; 
e) As you say, it's just as a display. But the ISO decimal setting will be more than a display --- it will be the default in the legacy financial world. Instead of changing that default in the reference implementation and instead of changing 1XBT = 1.00000000, I recommend all other wallets/apps select their preferred display, of which there will be many.
@_date: 2014-10-22 08:12:33
Yes, and the default reference implementation expresses 1 full bitcoin as 1.00000000 (edit: I would be most worried about public's confusion on expressing the known 21 million limit in a different way). 
When you suggest 1 XBT = 100 satoshis or satoshi is current base unit, you are still introducing a decimal   but you are really saying that 8 will never change which is a false premise.

Good interview, Trace. Bitcoin could indeed benefit from more economic spokespersons.

Which sounds better? There will only be 21 trillion bits in the world OR there will only be 2.1 quadrillion satoshis in the world.

The integer is the space to the left of the decimal point. If total decimal places are expanded to 12 or 16 in the future (from 8 today), then what you call the "base unit" is no longer the base unit.

I looked into the XBT issue a few months ago and the request has to be made by an existing national (central) bank for ISO to consider a new currency code. Also, see

You can't have XBT at ISO4217 equal something different than the integer on the block chain. I wrote a piece on this today for Coindesk.

@_date: 2014-11-17 08:34:04
Exactly. It also comes down to what the foundation wants to stand for. For instance, should the foundation accept funding from Silk Road? To many people, SR represents a moral and free market that reduces street violence around drugs and provides cheap generic prescription drugs to the developing world. On the other hand, you have existing foundation members, typically VC-funded, that wouldn't want to be a part of a group that accepted SR membership.

+1 Jeff, another view: 
1. Chartalists (Krugman, Kaminska, et al.) 
2. Gold bugs (Schiff, North) 
3. Bitcoin 2.0 nutjobs and envious types
@_date: 2015-05-15 12:37:35
Remember, these are broad categories of bitcoin critics. Of course, there are valid criticisms of Bitcoin even from within the non-critics. Anyone still uncomfortable but still researching would be a prudent skeptic.
I lumped into nutjobs those who believe that the native token security of a de-centralized blockchain doesn't matter OR non-Bitcoin blockchains can be as resilient as the non-cartelized version. Colored coins based on Bitcoin blockchain are not included in this type of Bitcoin 2.0.

The difference now is that law enforcement wants to know and stop pre-crime.
@_date: 2015-05-27 06:12:35
Correct. The block reward is a transaction fee subsidy. Increasing block size is therefore an extension of that subsidy.
@_date: 2014-10-24 06:01:18
 Good point and I agree. Initially, the ISO application process was treated differently than a simple toggle for display purposes, so it was less controversial. I think what has changed is that the discussion has now evolved to the possibility of changing the decimal point in the reference implementation also. ISO classifications are not so easily changed once established.

Greek government doesn't want bitcoin because it would dramatically curtail social spending and diminish the welfare nanny state. Once pervasive, the elixir of bitcoin restrains government spending to what is extracted from its subjects via taxation. 
The Greek people will "need" bitcoin because it will protect them from the increasingly probable drachma inflation.
