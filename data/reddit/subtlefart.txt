This is a fork. What makes a network are the participants. What you did was fork bitcoin. All you did was copy a set of rules. 
You could also copy all of the rules of the National Football League, even hold a match between two teams you created. This is not the NFL. You did not create another NFL.

I guess you don’t mind inflation and government manipulation of currency. You don’t mind paying for bailouts that hold no one accountable for the taking of so many Americans wealth. You don’t mind that currency doesn’t scale to everyone who needs it. You don’t mind that it would mean people in counties like Venezuela have to starve because of government fiat manipulation. And most of all you, evidently, wouldn’t mind if the IMF took away your ability to interact with the world economy with a push of a button. 
You’re thinking of this application in terms of America. While we need this decentralized system, impoverished parts of the world that have kleptocratic governments need it much much more. It’s not a luxury it’s a necessity for freedom from oppression. 
So go ahead and keep praising your nanny central banking system. It will fail. Go ahead and look at the history of moneys. They only last a couple hundred years. And the dollars time is up.

Historically all currency’s have a non zero value. Hell you can even dig up a Roman coin from the 4th century B.C, and it still will have value.

I know it’s hard not to get emotional but try and refrain. 
In no place did I assert that what you said was not history. What I am saying that the idea that an enslaved people are incapable of breaking their chains is absurd and historically incorrect. 
There are many examples of slaves deciding to change their fate. Spartacus famously led a slave rebellion in the Third Servile war against the Roman Republic.  
I see no reason why these slaves could not have done the same. They didn’t, maybe given more time they would have in fact I know they would have it is our human nature.

Andreas has just recently become a bitcoin millionaire thanks to many donations. Andreas got in Bitcoin pretty early but he did in fact sell and did not hodl those early coins he acquired. He has spoken about it many times and has said he had a family and needed it to support them.

What he is saying should be looked at as inspiring considering our circumstances. 
The idea that you (we) can choose to break free from your masters. That even the most organized oppression cannot stop the majority. You have the power to change your fate despite your rulers malevolent ideas for you. 
We are in the process of making the conscience decision to break away from monetary slavery. 
What is wrong with this idea? What am I missing? The majority should be able to overthrow minority rule. No matter how systematic and organized.

Wrong. Very wrong. 
BCH and LTC are nothing alike. Litecoin is different from BTC in three key ways. Not a single one is block size limit:
- 4x as many coins (84 million vs. 21 million for Bitcoin)
- 1/4 the block confirmation time (2.5 minutes vs 10 minutes for Bitcoin)
- Scrypt proof-of-work (simpler and less energy-intensive mining)

It does indeed exist. It is also not ***truly*** decentralized. There are many aspects of using bitcoin that are centralized, such as exchanges. 


We are living in the future. Today there are 1600+ examples of competitors to Bitcoin. They have had almost 10 years to make a better Bitcoin...

The license plate is saying 
“This is what you get when you hodl”
Money flows from the impatient to the patient in markets. 
Patient does not mean never ever cash out. 
Besides. You could could argue if he took profit and still holds at least the original principle amount he’s still HODLing.
Taking profits is part of investing. You don’t want to be too leveraged in a particular asset. 
Banks reallocate all the time. Even if they are bullish on an asset. You reallocate back down to your predetermined strategic allocation to save yourself from overexposure.

How is fintech IOT? 
Also, no one just starts a lending institution. Besides. You seem like you think ‘blockchain’ is some magic sticker you can slap on something to improve its functionality. 
Most large corporations these days have entire teams dedicated to researching and developing use cases for bitcoin to their respective industries. These teams will work for years on proposals. 
What about blockchain would benefit a lending company?
Have you found examples of existing financial devices doing this?
Quite a dream for such a short post. Seems like you have put little thought into this idea.

Wrong. Online crypto exchanges are what’s known as a [network effect, or a positive network externality that increases marginal utility to all network users as more users join the network](
So yes, exchanges are a huge centralization point of bitcoin, and this needs to be fixed soon.

Do you think there was a 6k BTC sell order in the books? When he sold he sold the price all the way down to its daily low. Meaning he sold at the bottom.

It’s annoying when people don’t do any research. 


You said he didn’t sell at the bottom. He did. Your statement is incorrect. I provided a written source that even provides a link to said tx. 
You’re wrong. It’s okay. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:41:20
Gotcha. I thought I was actually missing something. As far as I understand it consensus is a decentralized form of decision making. Which would make it resistant to hostile takeovers, unless you can coerce the majority of the users (which has been done at smaller scale)

@_date: 2018-03-08 20:30:57


The issue is whether or not he sold at the bottom, not his intentions (those are impossible to know)  


[again, here is the tx]
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:43:03


That’s not how consensus works. The centralized powers in this scenario would be the devs. Their wishes were not met in SegWit

He didn’t what??
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:55:51


What are you asking? Do you think his only objective was to try to maximize his profits? Did you read the article? 
First off, only way to accomplish this would be to do a private off chain sale. No exchange has that kind of volume to sell all those coins at the top. 
Obviously this was a malicious attack. He sold at the bottom to try and break the $6k support. He failed. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:53:09


If you were more sophisticated in your research, you’d the block explorer data I provided lists the date of the confirmation. Pretty easy to find out during during that time btc was trading between $6-7k.  
So yes. He sold at what is widely called the bottom
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:16:05


I’m not sure what you mean by UASF puppet masters. SegWit was supported and made possible through consensus from the users, not the so called ***central powers*** or ***puppet masters*** the devs did not want SegWit. The people did ✊��

Can’t wait till the full build out of layer 2 lays waste to all of these shitty alts. 
Many of these people behind these knew that the tech that makes their alt ‘so much better’ than Bitcoin would inevitably be built on top of the superior Bitcoin blockchain, making these alts scramble to find a case for value. 
They got impatient and tried to rush to market first, it’s been proven this does not work for internet protocols. This is not going to end well for shitcoins

You are part of the problem. What you fail to realize is that as long as Bitcoin is growing, the majority of users will be new to crypto. It is necessary there is attention paid to these new users, they are welcomed in and their issues are understood NOT dismissed because they are not highly technical. Shame on you. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:26:19
LOL! Thank you for this. I just made a post about this very subject and got ridiculed by u/tracer289 and u/lowfatbiscuits for being a noob and having a question that is on a lot of people's minds. Fuck those two old grey hair wannabe speculators. Seriously. It's easy to see that as long as we are doing are jobs well and bitcoin is growing the majority of its users will be new to bitcoin and very lost in the tech of it all. These two instead of trying to foster that enthusiasm, they want to shoot you down. There's no place for that as far as I'm concerned. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:15:47
I have yet to experience such an attitude of dismissal toward a newcomer to this community. Everyone else I have communicated with in the crypto community has been more than helpful and understanding. Your behavior isn't going to help the community grow. If you did posses such a high understand of blockchain tech you would have no problem and expel little energy/time answering the question I posted. Since your quickest answer is to watch a lecture that was prepared for people who are far more advanced that I  am, I can only assume you lack the knowledge to answer it in your own words.
