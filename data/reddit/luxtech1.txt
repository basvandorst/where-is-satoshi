I've already made millions off this and diversified into safer sectors for income protection. Your speaking to an analyst bro. I went to school for this and invested into it before it became mainstream. If you actually new anything about investing you'd know that the best analyst in the world say to put 10% into this space. I started with 5% into this space years ago. That has now outgrown every other asset. If you were smart you'd be doing the same, tho your just one of those novel investors who parks their money in slow growing sectors to play it safe never really diversifying to true growth potential investments. Like I said, after your God warren buffet decides to hop in like he eventually did with apple and google, then I'll sell you my cat turds. By then it will have slowed down though and you'll be holding onto yet another slow growing asset. Safer yes, but less profit potential by the time you finally see what everyone has been telling you

Bud, I bought in 2011. I've made higher profits on this than any investment in history. Maybe you should listen to the actual tech people instead of people like warren buffet who said sell google stock and all other tech stock in the 90's tech stock crash where they were all down by 99%. But whatever, keep investing in slow growing assets that will not make you enough to retire on till your 80. Don't worry, I'll tip you generously in crypto when your working at my hotel as an 80 year old bartender. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 06:19:21
Yeah, I'll have you buy the cat turds when the dollar dies. You obviously haven't looked into this subject long enough. Do you even know what the lighting network is? A second layer that makes transactions instantly. It's the google of internet stocks. Because like google it's the first layer everyone uses to get to the alt coins. Think of etherium as bing, not as good as google, but with time will evolve to serve better functions just how google has better results for some things than google. Good luck parking your money in slow growing investments. I'll make sure to leave a position for you open at my hotels so you can have a job to work at in your 80's since your investments will have only quadrupled by then.

Rich coming from the guy who cares so much to keep cyberstalking me. So what's the lie, am I rich and pretending to be poor, or poor and pretending to be rich? I love messing with poor idiots like you. Pisces you off to see the life I'm living. Dont worry, I'll leave a job open at my hotels for you too. As a janitor tho, the bartender job is only open for this dude cause at least he invest. You'll be cleaning the shitters 
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:33:33
Well, hopefully you won't follow in his footsteps. Though I doubt that with how your investment mindset is. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:20:20
Did you just read the guys first sentence? I know it's hard for such a mind like yours to read more than 3 sentences. But had you, you would've read the "not your keys, not your crypto" line he fed you. Though I'm sure at this point you don't even know enough to know what that means. It means not to leave your crypto in an exchange, especially not your life savings. Then your just begging to fall victim to an exit scam to a shady exchange such at the one in that article. An exchange this subreddit has warned everyone about since it's inception. Again I don't expect your little mind to understand any of this. Keep walking past those bars of gold though. Let everyone else pick them up so you can loan it from them later

Then I shall cash in my checks myself! Wait?

So it can seperate the sounds in a song? Like say I wanted just the trumpet it could seperate that audio track and give me just the trumpet noise?

Are they really though? China has one of the highest VPN uses in the world. They make up about 60% of VPN income revenue. All they did was grow a market for a way of getting around their "great firewall"
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:55:26
Wooh! Then I can buy at 2k! Maybe even 1k if I'm lucky.
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:53:22
People like you are hilarious, you sit in the sidelines watching it happen, meanwhile denying it will ever succeed just because your mad you didn't move on it when you had the chance. The funniest part is you always have the chance. It's like watching a moron walk a bar of gold on the sidewalk over and over again wondering if they should pick it up, each time coming back to see the bar of gold getting smaller and smaller. Will come back to talk to you in 10 years and see how staying out of the market did for you. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:18:25
That's a very sad story, I see why you hate bitcoin so much after your mom made you buy at 15k. Well, if you would've listened to any season investor they would've told you to wait. Maybe one day you'll have the courage to go back into the space, though from the looks of it I only see you with a rope in your moms basement and a very sad family the next day. Good luck with your sad life bro, if you ever need that janator job my door will be open for you. Maybe I won't make your worklife such shit now that you told me why you hate crypto so much.

For weed I'm in cronos group, aurora cannabis, and cannopy growth. For the tech stocks i'm into google, goog, amazon, and tesla.

Robinhood app, has some of the top ones from the Canadian market. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:46:19
People like you were saying the same thing when it rose to 1000 dollars and fell down to 100 dollars. A rise to 100 from 10 dollars mind you. You need to learn how to do math or you'll forever be poor
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:41:08
Yeah lying. I'll leave a janitorial position available for you too
@_date: 2019-02-11 22:31:14
Got to play to win right? The last 8 years in this space have been amazing for me. I have been able to retire before 40, and invest into things that have provided me an income thanks to it. Every business and revenue this unlocks for me always goes back in, no matter what. All the businesses I buy out or build up accept bitcoin too. 
This is the biggest thing I see to adoption; the more bitcoin grows, the more we as investors can expand into other industries. So the guys who won't evolve and adopt crypto, will eventually be bought out by us. Then when we buy them out, we will make them accept crypto, converting the world by buying out one outdated dinosaur business after another. At the end, we'll all be buying the banks, and converting them to accept it too.
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:44:52
so buying at less than a penny, then seeing it run to 10 dollars then dropping to 1 dollar is a loss to you? Or how about buying at 700 and seeing it run to 20k then down to 3k is still a loss to you? I think you need to go back to school to learn math. Bet you'll be back here when it runs to 300k then drops to 60k saying thats a loss too huh? 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:06:04
I will buy all 21 million when that happens! Then sell it as a collectable for millions! 
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:37:40
Like Bill Clinton said to China when they tried blocking the internet; "your going to black the internet of money? It's like trying to pin jello to a wall. Good luck"
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:52:38
So what your saying is, all we have to do is waste time till we get there? 
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:42:19
This kills the fiat currency, &amp; replaces it with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:25:38
Oh man, that would just pass along the charge to the costumer. They would do the same to us charging us for storing money with them. This could be huge for crypto if apps like coinbase and other let you deposit your checks there. Then they evolve to a banking app that let's you invest at the same place you park your cash. I hope this happens, the market would grow faster than we've ever seen before if this does, cause I'd make a lot more barket buys if the money was already there and I didn't have to transfer it first before making my impulse buy. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:10:27
So what does negative interest rates mean? That they'll pay me interest on the money I borrow from them? Or the Fiat I hold? I'm so confused. Can a smart person clear this up for me? 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:08:43
ah I see. What's your app about? 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:46:54
Then I will sell all the remaining bitcoins for hundreds of dollars! Hundreds I tell ya!
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:44:36
Who said I took loans for my crypto investment? That would be retarded. Nope, only investing my income and liquidation of other assets. You stay out of the game tho; I really want to see you come in for a loan one day just so I can give you a ridiculous interest rate. &amp; when you ask me if I take cash, I'll say yeah, but I'll also toss in the fact that you'll get a 10% discount if you pay in bitcoin just to let it burn 
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:04:35
Who's afraid to buy at 3k? I've been buying all the way down. Every last spare cent of my checks goes into BTC. Am I the only one investing into this thing like it's my 401k?
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:52:36
Thanks bro! I learned a long time ago from very wise investors to diversify my bonds yo. Those investors; Wu Tang Clan
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:53:35
!Remind me in 10 years!
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:55:11
Who wants a shitty lambo when they got a 2020 roadster reserved. Moon already happened for me bud. Been in since 2011. Everything else that comes will just be icing on the cake now. I'll make sure to increase your interest rates when I buy out your bank too in 10 years. You'll only be able to pay in btc too
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:16:18
Nope, buying them out does. Congrats, you just gave me the best idea for the position I would offer you. Consider the manager position filled, now we'll only have janitorial postions available for you. And you can ask yourself how you feel about that next year when you start working for us. Shit maybe I'll be petty and buy out the building you work in now just to force you into our employment. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:53:46
Robinhood app has some good ones. I'm invested into cronos group, aurora cannabis, and Canopy growth through there. 0 fees so no having to deal with broker firms and their insane fees whenever you make a buy.
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:00:07
Nothings bigger than my ego, not even my holdings. Hence why I love to shit on idiots like you now that I have all the free time in the world. It's hilarious seeing you guys try and deny what you've been shown too, because we all know deep down inside your pissed. You tell yourselves that those like me just won the lottery in investing. When in reality you yourself know deep inside that you fucked up and missed out, and you keep telling yourself that it was just a lucky draw for everyone else to keep yourself from ever investing. Because if you ever consciously acknowledged it, you'd probably end yourself for realizing how dumb your ignorance was to not have moved on it. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:19:56
Go to your bosses garage and record then, let's see if his shitty collection even matches mine. Shit I'll even go to my other warehouse down the street and show the Mclaren &amp; dodge demon. That's the warehouse where I keep my prize possessions.

Oh that is dope! I can see how this will be useful for musicians. No more having to buy sheets of notes or learning it by ear. Let me know when you get to the investment round phase, I might be interested!

I've been in since 2011 buddy, can you guess how horrible this has done for me? I don't even have to work anymore. Shit the monthly revenue from my 5 buildings this has helped me achieve is probably your years income alone. So yes, well talk next year about how shitty your work is. Maybe I'll offer you a job managing one of my buildings just so we can keep this convo going. Though you'll have to accept 1% of your pay in crypto. No negotiating, it's a contract I make all my employees sign. I love highering crypto denyers. Makes it so much funnier once they realize the thing they hate is the thing keeping them going in perpetual servitude. You can either have it serve you, or be highered by someone like me and have you serve it. Looks like with your mindset you're only option is to serve it. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:51:39
Tesla, amazon, google, goog. Those are the blue chips for the safest bet, there are others, but they're not blue chips like these who have a high probability to still be around in 10 to 20 years.

What tech stocks are you into? 
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:35:46
That's also why I split my investments between crypto, weed stocks, &amp; Tech stocks. You'd have to kill a lot of sectors to get me to start over. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:57:27
Forsure! Happy investing! Maybe 10 years from now we'll be partnering up in some business ventures once our investments grow to size ^_^

Exactly, they didn't specify which cash tho. Bitcoin is my new cash, not bitcoin cash though, I have some, but it's not what I classify as my new cash.

What do you think bitcoin a b c and bitcoin s v are? They have tried this, and have failed miserably so far.

You must be MacNfee then. Have fun eating your dick in 2020 when your million btc bet doesn't pan out. Should've said 2021 a year after the halving reduces the supply, causing the supply and demand charts to tip as they do every halving.

Coming from the guy who keeps replying to the guy trolling him that's rich. I got all the time in the world now that I don't have to work for a living. &amp; trolling morons like you is my favorite pass time, especially when I get to rub in your face where patiently investing has gotten me too. Before you go off yourself for feeling like such a loser, call the hotline, maybe they can help you off the edge. Look up Warren Buffet and what he does with his spare time. Getting to make the "I told you so" guys see what they told us not to do has gotten us too is the best time. Every-time I shit on people like you I see the faces of all the morons who would've kept me from getting here had I listened to them. So now I make sure to make some time out of my day just to make sure you guys know how stupid your fears are, and what they made you miss out on.
