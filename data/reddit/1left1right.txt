I just tried using Abra after getting my bank info verified etc.  Tried depositing the minimum and was declined.  Makes ZERO sense

yea i trying to find an app that works identical to cashapp.  i found abra but a little unsure of it.  guess ill just do a bit more research
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:43:07

@_date: 2019-07-02 19:16:26

they apparently knew my bday and i dont have a high end android with a fingerprint sensor.  i gave up on those expensive android phones a while back

Coinbase buys have been disabled since day 1 all I did was register and add my bank to it.  I can send btc to coinbase and withdraw just cant buy.  Trying to find an instant buy with low fees like cashapp.  Abra accepted me but declined my debit card for no reason.
I've used Gemini in the past but dont like the 3 to 5 day wait

i loved cashapp until some fuckhead had to go and grab my phone and do some fraud shit when i was in a wheelchair.  i was able to contact support and they directly called me from their business line.  now i go to contact them and I have to wait 24 hours for a response.
shit just happens

Man speak English

@_date: 2019-07-02 15:58:16
Ehh I forgot my info for Gemini waitin on an email from them.  I'm in no rush
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:58:14

trying to find something similar to CashApp that is 1% fee and only 0.0005 Network fee
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:36:03
@_date: 2019-08-17 08:58:57
doesnt support USD
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:54:51
the states, that was also 2 years ago
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:20:57
takes forever to be verified
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:25:03
cashapp usually takes ppl 1 to 3 days to be verified and Kraken up to a month or so
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:52:53
is it like gemini or uphold or coinbase where you have to wait days or even a week to withdraw?
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:43:40
i just registered again after 2 years ago, pending verification now 24 hours
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:01:24
Would be a lot better if there was an app for the company AND if you accepted people in the STATES
