I know what zero means, but I also know from my firm grasp of English language that I can say that and add a caveat, which I did but you seem to have chosen to ignore. If you want to take a single word that I said in isolation and run with it then fine, but in doing so you're not actually taking on board the full meaning of what I said and are instead putting words in my mouth and manufacturing meaning out of it to suit your argument. Not cool!

A Nano S would certainly be the most secure. I use Electrum myself, also an excellent option. As mentioned, keeping on an exchange, unless you're preparing to sell or exchange for other crypto, is just not a good idea.

Valid, but odds of any one of those things happening? I'd lean more towards the positive myself, but maybe that's just me being a glass half full kind of guy. On the outlawing front though, signs currently point to acceptance long term, not outlawing. I hear more good news in that respect than I do negative.
Personally, I would not let fear of these things stop me from buying BTC. Of course, putting ALL your money in would never be a wise thing, but that would apply to anything. Always diversify.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:15:24
Yes, if you held BTC at the time of the fork and you had it on an exchange that supported BCH (not all of them did), or you had in a private wallet.

I had no idea Coinbase were a licensed institution that can make loans! Wow, that's great. I'm taking out a 1000 BTC loan and will pay them back in a year. This is amazing!!
Seriously, it literally meets none of those criteria lol!
Coinbase (or any other similar entity, Bittrex etc.) are not regulated or licensed like the banks... if you had the money you could start your own such company today without any red tape or restrictions. Most importantly though, they are not a safe place of storage for your crypto currency. Everyone knows this... you are better off keeping it in a private or paper wallet. You technically don't even own your crypto on somewhere like Coinbase, and if they go belly up or get hacked, you've lost everything. It would be the equivalent of keeping fiat under your mattress vs in a bank vault. Forgetting the possibility of a triple digit inflation crisis (in which case it wouldn't matter anyway), your money is physically safe in a bank and insured. Your Bitcoin on Coinbase is absolutely not. And OK, your Bitcoin isn't insured anywhere, but it IS safer and more secure in a private/paper wallet.
Banks also offer a wealth of other services that the likes of Coinbase simply do not, and again such services are heavily regulated for the safety of their consumers. Of course, crypto exchanges offer some kind of exchange service if you want to buy Ethereum with your Bitcoin for example, but it's not quite the same thing and you're very much at your own risk with the whole process.
For an entity such as Coinbase to earn the bank moniker, there would have to be A LOT of significant changes, upheavals and regulations that could actually be more detrimental in the grand scheme of things, but all that aside, even calling Coinbase a 'bank' is going to be an anathema to many people.

@_date: 2017-08-03 15:16:10
It's certainly always haunted me that I didn't invest in BTC back in 2010 when I first heard about it. I remember thinking it could be a sound investment... I just listened to the negativity and was talked out of it. Then a couple years later when it had gotten to be (what appeared at the time anyway) an insane value, I thought it was too late, so I forgot about. Fast forward a few years and it's now x10 that value! So I buy in... finally. Knowing my luck it'll crash to the floor now ha! But I'm hodling... I will try to forget about it and resist the urge to check the value every hour, but under no circumstances am I selling. I'm prepared to lose it all, but more than anything else I believe in the philosophy behind Bitcoin. :)

Hang on... you bought 20 BTC worth of Neo which, depending on the exact day you bought it, may have only cost you just over $1, perhaps less if you bought in May. That would now have seen you a x50 return, so that 20 BTC would now be worth 1000 BTC!! MORE than making up for your losses. And this isn't to mention the BCH you gained in the fork, which from 600 BTC worth isn't exactly pocket change.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:24:34
The term 'bank' has a definition. It doesn't meet that definition, not even close. Therefore it isn't one. A bank isn't an arbitrary place that you can pick and choose the meaning of. It either is a bank or it isn't. It isn't. It's not a 'wanna be bank', nor have I seen any claim from Coinbase or any other such entity that they are. You're the only person I've seen call it such.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:53:55
Yeah, I agree... but I can certainly see how some people would genuinely post this if it was genuine. It's human nature. Like serial killers who want to get caught... without others knowing of their deeds, they feel hollow. They NEED recognition. So yes, claiming lost BTC and serial killing = same... obviously not. ;)

@_date: 2017-08-26 12:21:52
Well, home internet in dial-up form popularised in the mid to late 90's. For anyone to have been living by themselves independently at that time would, more often than not, now be in their 40's. So, given how Bitcoin is centered amongst a much younger demographic (millennials in-particular), it's no surprise many of us were ushered in to the world wide web courtesy of our parents... and I salute mine for it. As a young teenager in the 90's, my parents certainly didn't HAVE to pay for it... I know they didn't use it or even understand what it was, so I am very appreciative of them giving me that opportunity. :)
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:52:46
Electrum is EXTREMELY safe and it is EASY. If you think this is hard or requires technical skills, I don't know how you have a job in IT, never-mind a six-figure one. My mum managed it and she's a technical idiot. What you're talking about regards paper wallets, importing, managing... that's not necessary to keep Bitcoin safe and is several steps on from the basics and all that is required to keep Bitcoin safe and secure.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:35:29

@_date: 2017-08-27 13:55:55
Yeah that's very true... I've had that conversation with a few friends and none of them have said "I want to buy this now!" at the end of that discussion. That will come some time later, if at all. I do find even those who have heard of it though tend to be very wary, as what they've heard tends to be more about the criminal or bubble aspect, so the little knowledge they have is very skewed. It certainly is a lot to take in for someone who is coming at it fresh and new for the first time.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:28:23
That will certainly have an impact, but it would have to happen en masse to see a swing from circa 20k to the 2k mark. Of course, if the Winklvi cash out in one fell swoop it might spell trouble lol! Can't quite see that happening though.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:19:13
Yeah, that's going to make it quite a bit more costly given I can do a direct bank transfer on LB, sometimes at less than the market rate for BTC, and have the BTC in my wallet within minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:52:01
I'm well aware of it. But when you break down the steps required to simply secure your Bitcoin with an Electrum wallet, I defy anyone to explain how this is beyond someone with a fairly decent PC competency. The actual process of doing this is not difficult, i.e if someone has purchased Bitcoin on an exchange and they want to move it to a private Electrum wallet. I am not talking about an in-depth understanding of encryption and the inner workings of the Blockchain... yes, great to know all that and I'd encourage anyone to educate themselves, but the absence of that detailed understanding in no way precludes someone from installing Electrum, setting it up and moving your Bitcoin to it. No superiority required.

The bubble and death talk HAS to stop at some point. Bitcoin is already being discussed in circles and made headlines in places where it would have been considered a joke a few years ago.

Comparison with a stock like Apple or Google perhaps isn't as fair, but let's take Gold, which I think Bitcoin has far more in common with. That has a market cap of around $7 trillion. Bitcoin is only currently at just over $70 billion. If it managed to achieve a level anywhere near what Gold is, a six figure value will be easy.
Now I know how this may sound, but Gold is not accepted in any stores. It is difficult to transport. You can't use it to buy and sell things over the internet. It is difficult to convert to fiat. But that doesn't prevent trillions dollars of wealth from being parked stationary in this metal.
If in years to come (and yes it's a MASSIVE IF) people have as much confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value as gold, then things could snowball pretty quickly and $500k would easily be surpassed.
The POTENTIAL really is colossal. Whether it's fully realised or not remains to be seen, and I believe we have a long way to go and a few hurdles to overcome, but it's exciting to think about. :)
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:13:01

@_date: 2017-08-25 19:21:20
They won't need to, nor does any saving medium need to become worthless, but if Bitcoin does become a more attractive option and enough people DO move a % percentage of their savings in to Bitcoin from Gold, then its value will decrease as a result. This is already happening and clearly there are many people who are more comfortable and confident with their money in Bitcoin than gold. How far this goes, we shall have to see, but if you're saying all these people are suckers who will lose their money, I have to vehemently disagree. Yes, that COULD happen, no one can guarantee otherwise, but it would take something pretty remarkable and as yet unforeseen. No less so than the bus that may run any of us over tmrw. If Bitcoin TRULY succeeds, everyone wins... just some more than others.
Of course there are plenty of useless shit coins... I don't think anyone is saying otherwise. That really doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin though, and many of the other alts will be a distant memory in a few years time. Bitcoin can happily co-exist alongside others though, whether that be Etherium, Neo etc. This is a not a winner takes all crypto race.
Plenty of people hold stock, Gold and other metals... not sure what you mean by that? Pyramid?? OK, now I'm starting to think you don't actually understand what Bitcoin is. Pyramid it is categorically not.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:05:03
It's always the same issue if you're using sterling. I use BTC as my base (LBC being my chosen purchase location), and then just send from there to an exchange. I have used Bittrex, Binance and Bitstamp without issue so far. Depends what alts you want, but Bittrex have good selection.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:00:13
It's a strange mentality for these people to be so agressively anti-Bitcoin though... yeah, first time I heard of it I paid no attention... kept hearing about it, thought it must be a scam, a bubble, crazy risk... NOT ONCE did it ever occur to me to go online and start berating another persons decision to put their money in to it. I just don't get that. Now I finally own Bitcoin, I couldn't care less what they say though... their loss! I think it will be funny to revisit some of those comments in a few years time though. ;)
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:55:30
You've gone WAYYY off track here... your ORIGINAL comment said;
"The only ways to keep your coins absolutely safe require technical skills, which most people don't have."
That's what I was speaking to, but you now seem to be going down another road and are either being argumentative for the sake of it, or are genuinely confused about the difference between understanding something in great depth and detail, vs the technical process of undertaking a task... they are quite different things and not mutually exclusive to each other.
I specifically said, as you quoted me "It requires ZERO 'technical' skills to keep your Bitcoin safe"... and it doesn't, with the caveat (I say again) of using a PC to a reasonable level of competency. 
Of course, you can get all in depth about seeds, addresses etc. if you want, but if someone SIMPLY wants to KEEP BITCOIN SAFE (a task which you seem to imbue with great technical prowess), the physical process of installing Electrum and moving your Bitcoin to it IS NOT HARD and does not require superior or vast technical skill beyond that of a reasonable level of PC competency... although naturally the instructions would need to be followed. It is not much more difficult than installing a programme or piece of software, just with a few extra steps and precautionary measures. If someone gets confused when using MS Word, this is NOT the kind of person I am talking about. 
FULL, DETAILED &amp; IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING of the technical aspects and workings of Bitcoin, wallets, encryption etc. is a totally different ball game however, so on that front I am in full agreement... and I would also encourage anyone interested in Bitcoin to learn as much as they can about it. But absence of that understanding absolutely DOES NOT preclude an individual from keeping their Bitcoin safe! It just doesn't.
The problem is, in your line of work, you will mostly come up against people are who clueless, therefore giving you a rather distorted view. Those that can figure this stuff out... well, why you ever have reason to encounter them? So if I'm biased, you are even more so.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:12:09
I'm well aware of that, but as I say, I have seen people with pretty basic and rudimentary knowledge manage this. Purchasing Bitcoin and securing it on an Electrum wallet is NOT hard... are you seriously suggesting otherwise? I guess it entirely depends on your definition of 'technical skill'. There must be a opposite to the Dunning-Kruger where the effect speaks of someone's desire to appear of high ability and competence, believing they are capable of something that other people are not... or perhaps that's just a good old fashioned superiority complex lol!

Path of least resistance... it's easier to ask a question on Reddit and have someone spoon feed you the info than it is to do your own research. When people are told and see what's involved, I highly doubt you'll get many who go "whoah, no way, I'm not a computer scientist, I couldn't possibly manage that!" On the contrary. As I say, I've seen people I know personally with pretty basic skills manage it, so I'm only speaking of my own experience.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:04:24
Something about articles like this fills me with confidence actually... makes me realise how far we've got to go before people truly 'get it', which indicates just how much more value there will be in Bitcoin when that day comes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:07:24
Yeah 100% agree there... all the Lambo talk really doesn't help tbh, and while I know it's often said lightheartedly, many people WOULD actually do it. I'd have to have so much money to put down £100-200k on a car, such that it would need to be throwaway cash. I just don't get the sense in hodling for years, seeing your Bitcoin increase in value, resisting that urge to sell and all those around you screaming at you to do so... only for you to dump it all on a depreciating asset that sees a 20% hit the moment you drive it out the showroom, and then a year later it's less than half that value. Yeah, way to go, fiduciary responsibility done right!
As you say, a business investment, property, land... anything that can further increase your wealth, give you more opportunities etc... THIS is where the true potential of Bitcoin is. Buying shiny shit we don't need, that's just feeding back the system that got us in to this mess in the first place!

It requires ZERO 'technical' skills to keep your Bitcoin safe. ZERO. If you can operate a computer for basic functional tasks, you can move your Bitcoin to a private wallet such as Electrum with ease.
Yes, there has been some value manipulation but as you say, all equities suffer from that, and this has not impacted the price of Bitcoin in a negative fashion overall from a big picture point of view... and it's certainly not a reason to stay away from it. Heck, if you're using 'MANIPULATION' as an argument for staying away from any currency, sell up now and move to the Alaskan wilderness and use fish and fur as your means of trading!!
How could Bitcoin die exactly? I've heard this claimed numerous times, but I've yet to see a solid theory as to the how and why this would actually happen. Bitcoin can happily co-exist alongside other crypto-currencies, but NONE have even come close to proving themselves the way Bitcoin has, so it will be some time before you can even point to one that is as 'safe', nevermind one that's actually superior.

People are people... if there is a means by which something can be adopted for criminal means, so it will be done. This is the way it has always been and always will be as long as humans walk the earth. That may sound pessimistic... it's not, it's just reality. I am confident such issues will be tackled in their own way, but obviously there is concern there, and it will never be fully resolved, no more than it has been with traditional fiat. What impact any such attempts to 'police' Bitcoin may have on its value, who knows... it may crash, only to recover once more, or it may have none. No doubt that the community at large would welcome any solution if its criminal use proliferates out of control. No one has a crystal ball. HOWEVER, it is wrong to say Bitcoin's only or predominant use currently is for such purposes. That is factually incorrect. The vast majority of Bitcoin use is perfectly legitimate. Criminal enterprise, while significant, does not account for the majority of Bitcoin transactions. There are actually more anonymous cryptos than Bitcoin which may become favoured by criminals in the future anyway, so it could all be moot.
There is much excitement around Bitcoin because of the rapid value increase yes... that's to be expected. We are in that crazy exciting period, but that will eventually pass. Bitcoin will not increase in value ad infinitum... one day it WILL settle. No one gets excited about gold in that way, obviously, because it's more stable. That will eventually happen with Bitcoin. There will come a day where people who weren't here at this time will look back on all this fervor and excitement with curiosity and puzzlement. So yes, if you frame things a very specific way, it may APPEAR that everything about Bitcoin revolves around its value increase... but that's not the TOTALITY of what Bitcoin is, nor does it have anything to do with what it has the POTENTIAL to become.
I actually don't see Bitcoin replacing traditional fiat, not in my lifetime anyway... I think it can happily co-exist, along with other cryptos. We're just in crazy times at the moment... the infancy of it all, so there are lots of unknowns and road ahead will no doubt be a bumpy one.
Our attitude toward money is the problem, not the money (or Bitcoin) itself. Money, and by extension Bitcoin or any other crypto, asset or commodity, is morally neutral... it’s the love of money that gets us in to so much trouble.

Look up the 'Peter Principle' and understand that there will be incompetent people in positions of great power, influence and control in both the private sector and government, including the IRS.

@_date: 2017-08-15 13:18:53
I don't disagree... the big question is what that value will be and when? Some of the predictions sound mad, $1M etc. but then you look at the market cap of gold, which Bitcoin is often compared to, it's around $7 trillion. If Bitcoin got to that level (it's currently circa $70b)... whoa boy! Am I right in saying that would equate to about $500,000 per Bitcoin? Someone has done the math I'm sure.

What ICOs are you looking at? I see many, but find it hard sometimes to decipher the legit from the scams. What's your approach?
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:44:32
Of course, gold has been around for thousands of years vs Bitcoin's 8... no comparison there. But it does have a real purpose beyond speculation alone and the potential for SO much more. It fits the criteria of 'rare' even better than Gold as it is impossible for there to be any more than 21 million Bitcoin. New Gold deposits could be discovered at any time. It has some hurdles to overcome regards its use, but on that point alone, most people who have Gold don't use it for ANYTHING other than storing value, and although it does have some, it's not easy to do for the reasons previously stated. Bitcoin is already easier to use, and the more outlets which are developed for that, as well as improvements in the underlying technology which will facilitate this (the Lightning Network for example) the more it will proliferate. It's just a question of when in my opinion, not if.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:42:24
The thing is, we've been here before as you say... people KNOW (or feel super confident they do anyway) that the price will go back up. So they'll start buying again well before such a low floor is reached. At least that's how I see it. Who knows though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:48:58
OK let's not get sucked in to this Gold thing too much... it categorically is NOT the same thing, it just has similarities.
Someone either believes in the true potential of Bitcoin or they don't. Yes it has hurdles to get over, but in my opinion it will overcome them. I encounter FAR too much shortsightedness everywhere I go on this topic... I think that's a shame but I firmly believe in where this is going and $400k is a long, long way from best case scenario. I'm sure many will disagree but I expect in a few years time there will be a lot of 'oh, I got that wrong' from that side of the table. We shall see... :)

Bitcoin is somewhat of a hybrid... it's not singularly a currency, asset, equity, commodity or any other singularly definable 'thing'... it's a combination of them all, and there is even a social network element at play in there. This makes it utterly unique and I believe it's why so many people struggle to get their head round it as they want to pigeon hole it, to define what it is... but that is not easily done. 
In essence though, Bitcoin has value for exactly the same reason as the paper money in your wallet (even though, as I say, it's not singularly money)... it simplifies the exchange of goods and services in the modern world. And yes, it CAN do that, and it does have the function and potential to achieve that on a FAR greater scale than it does currently. Furthermore, the value of Bitcoin is directly tied to the number of its users and the frequency of their use. Good old fashioned supply and demand.
The pyramid/ponzi scheme argument has been put forward many times since Bitcoin's inception, but it just doesn't hold any water. Pyramid and ponzi schemes are actually quite different and individually distinctive forms of fraud...  but they share one thing in common: the first ones in make a lot of money while the last ones in foot the bill and invariably lose everything. The initial 'investors' are paid out DIRECTLY from new investors’ money. The return is always too good to be true and the gains (for those who actually get gains) are exponential.
It is actually understandable how someone could look at Bitcoin on the surface and accuse it of being a pyramid... it's value has risen dramatically in a matter of years, so fast that it's hard to keep up sometimes, and as you say, people encourage holding (but not everyone, that's important to say). But then ANY new technology could be accused of this.... it’s just rarely the the case that we get to invest in this sort of technology (and a brand new one at that) and profit as it’s adopted. It is more the unique nature of Bitcoin that has led rise to more of these 'scam' accusations, vs more 'traditional' investments or opportunities. There has never been anything like it.
New technologies follow a known adoption curve, which tends to include a period of exponential rise. Bitcoin is no exception. Ponzis and pyramids both create value for their oldest investors by stealing from the new. There’s no economics involved... just theft. This is categorically NOT what is happening with Bitcoin, so accusations of pyramid/ponzi are flat out false.
Bitcoin creates value for the old investors and the new by splitting a finite currency supply more ways. That’s not trickery or theft, just good-old-fashioned supply and demand at work... a basic and ancient economic principle applied to the world’s newest currency system.
Will it last, I don't know... no one does. Personaly, I believe it will. I think $20k will come and go with ease. On what timeframe it would be impossible to say, but I just believe in this, cheesy and vague as that may sound lol! I can't even fully explain WHY I do to be honest... well, I could reel off countless facts, figures, commentaries etc. but at the end of the day, it just makes perfect sense to me. But let's chat again in 5 years time and see where we're at... :)

Oh yes, that's true... he'll only get BCH if he had BTC in exchange that supported it at the time, or in a private wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:16:21
Ok, but they're not a bank. The word bank isn't exactly the correct one to use in this instance.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:22:03
You're twisting my words... I never said zero knowledge full stop, that would be stupid. I said zero technical knowledge, but with the caveat of still requiring knowledge of how to use a PC to a fairly decent standard. I figured it would be obvious they would already know what Bitcoin was and had done some research in to it. But no, if someone has to ask someone where the power switch for their computer is and has never heard of Bitcoin before, no chance... but that isn't the type of person I was referring to.

Da Nang Hooker: Hey, baby. You got girlfriend Vietnam? 
Bitcoin Hodler: Not just this minute. 
Da Nang Hooker: Well, baby, me so horny. Me so HORNY. Me love you long time. You party? 
Bitcoin Hodler: Yeah, we might party. How much? 
Da Nang Hooker: 348 Satoshis. 
Bitcoin Hodler: 348 Satoshis for both of us? 
Da Nang Hooker: No. Each you 348 Satoshis. Me love you long time. Me so HORNY. 
Bitcoin Hodler: 348 Satoshis too beaucoup. 116 Satoshis each. 
Da Nang Hooker: Me sucky-sucky. Me love you too much. 
Bitcoin Hodler: 116 Satoshis is all I have in my Electrum wallet
Da Nang Hooker: Okay. 232 Satoshis each. 
Bitcoin Hodler: What do we get for 232 Satoshis? 
Da Nang Hooker: Every t'ing you want. 
Bitcoin Hodler: Everything? 
Da Nang Hooker: Every t'ing.

Evidence of time travel? I think so.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:54:36
But what will cause such a crash? I've yet to see a serious and considered explanation for such a plummet in value. Outside of events that no-one can predict of course, such as a major exchange hack or something of that nature, I would be very interested to hear a reasonable set of circumstances laid out that would lead to such an event... because just saying it's going to happen holds no water in and of itself. There will be dips and corrections but what you're suggesting is a massive drop.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:43:20
You're aiding game cheats and profiting from them... they are absolute low lifes, scum, a cancer that needs to be cut out! I'd be far more disappointed in my child if he was involved in that vs selling drugs. Seems quite obvious to me that you should donate all your Bitcoin profits to charity and apologise to your parents AND the gaming community.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:41:32
So which one are you saying Coinbase is and why?
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:11:26
Lol, he wasn't kidding when he said he fucked up then lol! ;)
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:03:51
You really have presented a VERY poor case. Very poor.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:40:20
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Bitcoin IS Gold, far from it, but it has the potential to be. Sure, anything could happen. Same goes for Gold... North Korea has massive unmined potential (and not just Gold). What would happen if that is able to be accessed in the future? Who knows. Nothing is for certain. 100x increase on Bitcoin is pretty damn good though, and would actually get it close to Gold value... I don't think many people here would turn their nose up at a $400K Bitcoin lol! Don't forget Bitcoin has first mover advantage... it has survived a barrage of abuse, negativity and numerous take down attempts over the years and is still going strong. To imply another coin could come along and take the crown does it a major disservice in light of what it's endured. As time goes on, Bitcoin is only going to cement itself even more firmly at the top of the tree... at least that's what I see, but only time will tell.
As for other coins, yes arguably more potential for big profit there, but picking them is the trick... plenty of those can and will fall by the wayside over the next 5-10 years, and more will appear. The analogy with the dot-com boom has been made before, and while it's a completely different animal, the similarity will be evident in those cryptos that make it through the other side. For every Facebook and Amazon there are a dozen MySpace, Excite and Pets.com.
As mentioned elsewhere, the transaction time and fees for Bitcoin will get better... it's exactly what the Lightning Network is designed to do, and we should see improvements there very soon in fact.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:38:13
I have not, but looking at their website it appears they charge 4% total fees, which is shit. Apart from that, seems legit, but in light of their fees I find their mission statement to "make high commission charges on cryptocurrency FIAT sites extinct!" absolutely laughable! In the UK, Localbitcoins is still the cheapest and quickest way to buy Bitcoin I have found.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:11:12
There really isn't another way though... if you want Bitcoin NOW, it's the cheapest option (unless a friend will sell it to you). You literally cannot buy Bitcoin without a 3-5% mark-up in the UK, as even going via Euro exchange (Bitstamp for example) you take a big hit on the £/Euro conversion. We need a UK based exchange where you can do direct bank to bank £ transfer and buy at market price. Not sure why this doesn't exist yet.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:21:36
It would take an alien invasion with their quantum computers hacking the blockchain for us to see a HUGE dip. Even then, price would recover once we defeated the aliens and used their technology.

Less relevant interesting threads, more memes. Said no one. Ever.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:54:12
I think I misunderstood the original comment. Yes, you're right, if it rises enough that could happen.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:41:58
I have some bitcoin on Bitstamp, anyone know their plans for BCC? Do I need to move my BTC off there? What happens if I don't?
@_date: 2017-07-11 10:42:22
From everything I've read, there HAS to be a fork for the viable survival of Bitcoin in the long term. Why do you say otherwise? What is it a shit-screen for?
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:18:13
Given they are not supporting Bitcoin Cash though, does that mean I would lose out on that entirely? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:01:39
Who IS supporting Bitcoin Cash then? Is Bitrex and Bithumb the only ones? Poloniex say maybe. Coinbase say no. What about Bitstamp, Bitfenex, Kraken, Localbitcoins? Anyone actually endorsed it yet? If the majority don't, isn't it an epic fail before it's even started?? Sure, loads of people have private wallets, but many don't. These exchanges and wallets must house millions.
Plus, all I'm reading about is free money and people dumping it... if that happens, again, total fail in no time. So what the hell is the point of this?? :/
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:34:48
True. I've seen talk of it getting in to the low hundreds though... is that even possible? Just trying to figure out what voices to ignore and which ones to listen to lol!
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:01:50
I thought it did, I was just confused by the likes of the Nano S being referred to as 'hardware wallets', when surely Electrum is also if it stores on your device... i.e hardware?
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:41:00
Of course, but there are still a FINITE FIXED AMOUNT. That is hardly the case with $ or any currency.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:53:16
OK, thank you. So as long as it's in Electrum I'm all good anyway, so that's the first step. Is Electrum still an online wallet then, just more secure than Bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:29:33
A new address in Electrum you mean? Then find a wallet that supports BCC (I'm sure there will be some by then), and use the ORIGINAL private key that I had with Electrum? Am I understanding that correctly?
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:23:07
Is it OK to leave BTC on Bitfinex? I've recently put some there, but not sure how reputable they are in times like this? Will it be OK? I like the fact they will credit me with BCH without me having to do anything. Am I silly leaving it there? The talk of replay attack had me a bit worried. Not sure if I should just move to Electrum and then move back after the 1st?
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:16:00
You realise how dumb that sounds when there can only ever be 21m bitcoin, yet money can be manufactured whenever, and there is sure as hell more than $21m out there lol! Hope you're just joking and it went over my head. The alternative scares me.
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:31:37
Seriously you think there is a chance of a 2 FIGURE value on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:31:25
What follows? Big drop?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:24:46
On what time frame are you suggesting this might happen... imminent?
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:19:56
Forgive my ignorance but what is 'replay attack'? You're saying it's best to move my BTC from Localbitcoins and Bitstamp to somewhere else... but where exactly? A private wallet such as the Nano S? I don't have much, but I don't want to lose it of course.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:47:03
I currently have some BTC on Localbitcoins and Bitstamp, which I plan to move to an Electrum wallet tmrw. If I wanted to access BCH after the fork, would I simply then transfer from Electrum to Bitfinex (again, after the fork)? I know Electrum aren't supporting BCH.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:25:53
OK, thanks, but, and forgive my ignorance, how exactly would I "use a different wallet"? If Electrum don't support it then presumably it won't show up there? So would I have to send my BTC to another wallet in order to gain access to the BCC? Bit confused by this.
