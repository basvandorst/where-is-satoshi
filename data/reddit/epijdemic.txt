when i first transferred some coins from paper wallet to a Ledger Nano S it asked me if i want to use a SegWit or Legacy wallet. Choose Legacy because i was not sure what the consequence will be (and by this time SegWit2x was FUDing around).
So the question is: at what point will it be safe to go from Legacy to SegWit? And if one is on Segwit, can you go back to Legacy eventually?

if your balance only shows BTC, its basically nothing but some numbers in a database, right? :/

can you elaborate? what does running "your own stratum" server implicate? i can handle some networkstuff, but certainly not the ubergeektechone :/

Amazing hearing session. Totally worth the watch!

what happens to fiat deposits? get payed in btc? lost? goxedforgood?

a fix would be to give single entities/pools a hashlimit, so they can never reach 51%. if they overshoot a certain percentage, their confirmations are automatically invalid.
now this sounds harsh and unfair and stupid (to the monopolist), it might be in the favor of the whole community not to have centralized powerblocks.
ghash.io was close.. i'm getting the shits if i think of some NSA technician trying their new datacenter in utah on bitcoin  (satirical text, but the photos and center is still real)

Bitcoin is to paper money what email is to a paper letter.
A leap of advancement.

primiary because i want the blockchain have for myself on at least one trustable entity (myself) in between.
@_date: 2014-05-26 13:09:08
tweet  about it and get it on the keiser report.. i dont think the mainstream media is interested in a story that actually helps bitcoin (by showing that the bubble was not a volatile market, but single entities manipulating the shit out of it)
@_date: 2014-10-29 08:01:13
you seem quite solid. call me the crazy here: 100% bitcoin.

a piece of history

you would not call it fraud if the exchange "trades" on their own platform for intense amounts without depositing a single dime? like having endless supply and just buy and sell as you like?
in my book thats called "ramping", filed under market manipulation by abnormal means. being the exchange brings a responsibility to act as a service provider neutral to the market and not game the system to the exchange owners advantage.
think of the fed would at the same time act as stocks market, trade on their own platform and just print more money when they want to buy more of some stocks. sounds legit to you?

not worried about the monetary implication (aka speculation) but i'd like to use the stored coins reasonably some day... now if that day will never show, what good are those coins for then?
EDIT: i want to use bitcoin as a payment model rather than a speculation tool (which i have no expertise nor interest in)

Damn, i am in Amsterdam on the 7th only one night to wait for my connecting flight. Wondered what i should be doing...

is that the former Bitcoin Embassy in Tel Aviv?
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:57:32
my thought exactly. is there a "blockchain,info" for bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:00:43
same boat. all paper wallets here. will also transfer to new papers once the fork is done, then try to claim bcc with the old papets keys to offload on kraken. just where do i claim bcc safely? i am using blockchain.info (web &amp; mobile) for btc, is there something similar for bcc?
@_date: 2016-12-24 10:18:54
I hold coins since early 2013 right before the first little bubble and havent touched them since.
I desperately looked for opportunities to pay with BTC tho. i used things like  whenever i travelled to a foreign country to find restaurants or bars where i can pay with BTC via the mobile blockchain app. i would have LOVED to do that, but EVERY single entry in coinmap was outdated and sometimes the bar owneres didnt even know what bitcoins were.
i really miss more real world exposure and not only speculation on BTC :/
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:47:07
you are right. but bcash also forked again... man... forks of forks.. for forks sake.. i lost overview and am in a limbo on how to proceed :/
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:42:52
ok thanks, that sounds manageable

the video mentions "we only charge fees when you profit".
so, how exactly do you get your shares/fees if you only trade on user accounts via api with no api-rights to withdraw funds?
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:15:00
so its not a fee, but more a donation. i kinda like this bussiness model ;)

if your investment is very longterm (years) that it doesn't matter much when you buy as long as you buy and hold and not let your emotions get in your way of a rational long term investment strategy.
I have been doing this since 2013, and while I also bought into the steep ramp of the early smaller march rally i don't regret a thing (also bought additional ones after the correction).
ditch the altcoin thing. i did this myself when i started, had some early success with litecoin but lost on almost all the others. just focus on BTC if you plan to have the coins a bit longer.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:57:32
who can say for sure, but it seems HIGHLY likely something/someone tampered with gox
since the decentralization of exchanges it got harder for one entity to pull such thing off. centralization almost cries for misdeeds.
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:13:26
that clarifies, thank you. why does this smell like some ppl want to double their stash? its the rule of greed, and this will happen a lot if it worked out once, rendering the whole idea useless :/
@_date: 2015-11-03 14:25:23
hmm, if you give it api access to trade your coins on say bitstamp, can you set the amount of how much it is allowed to trade, or does it go all in all the way all the time?
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:42:29
ok, good. and what about funds on a mobile hot wallet like blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:35:34
ultimately and i guess a lot of novices want their BITCOIN to remain BITCOIN and not get dilluted by any altcoin scheme that this smells like.
tbh.. there is nothing more trust-crushing like this hardfork talk at the moment. it resembles instability and smells like a greedy moneygrab ("free money! double coins!"), which does smell like an op to destroy bitcoin honestly.

i just received a mail from kraken about the fork.
they say if you hold 1 btc on the exchange they gonna turn it into 1 btc + 1 bcc after the fork.
so if i keep coins in cold storage they will just be btc? i cannot wrap my head around this. please elaborate what this "doubling" means. i.e. can holders offload their coins on the "bcc chain" without touching the btc coins with private keys? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:38:19
he might, but his "teachings" unfortunately not so fast :)
