Creating a [Quadratic Voting]( solution with [HCharlanes]( and Schaeff.
It allows organizations to get votes from their members in a way that doesn't just take into account how *many* people vote for a proposal/candidate, but also how *much* they care about that proposal or candidate.
* [Github](
* [Live IDE](
* [Vote for us]( :)

What?  Most of the big boys in finance won't touch bitcoin with a ten-foot pole.

Errm no, closed source or open source has nothing to do with payment structure, it has to do with the availability and right to modify the source code.
There are plenty of open source programmers who get paid to code, and closed source programmers who don't.

Yeah, the reddit reference doesn't really make sense off of reddit...

How would you disrupt the internet with a couple million dollars? 
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:22:43
Historically large companies are awful at coping with disruption, due to organizational inertia
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:17:03
I mean, you're assuming you live in a vacuum. As soon as you do that there are going to be other people spending millions of dollars on counter measures

The feds already have quite a bit more from the silk road bust

OP is betting big. Reid is betting both smart and big.

Only if you were shortsighted... the smarter move would be to be a fast follower and try to use your existing user base to transition to the new technology.

And by "We" you mean "I".  The basic point was that you have to make a choice... if you want someone to work with the credit card systems, you need to be regulated.

If you're on this for the long term, the simple solution is to stop checking the price.
I have a yearly calendar event set to check the price of my bitcoin, and by more or sell - otherwise, the only way I find out about it is if I run into random posts like this, or see it in passing (and no matter what it is, I remind myself that I don't care because I'm in it for the long term)
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:19:01
Errm what?
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:22:11
If it's a long term price increase (based on the timelock), it's a very good thing for bitcoin.

If you look at the most popular open source projects right now, this is basically how they flourish.  You NEED a company who has a stake in the project to succeed to get that project off the ground.  Ultimately, it would be great if that company could be some type of DAC made of bitcoin holders, but that's not possible quite yet.

I believe humans make tradeoffs in their values all the time.  If you're not willing to make tradeoffs, you end up making stupid choices.

You get  a bit of the payout for the service of making your prediction.

But if we're going with the version where the government can regulate trading, then Company X would never have been able to make that trade in the first place.
@_date: 2015-11-22 22:20:49
You'd have to have a lot of money to move the price like that.  Then you open yourself up for litigation on a pump and dump scheme.

Coinbase can only do what it does because it's centralized.  What it does is work with regulators in a way decentralized institutions can't.

How is this getting upvoted... did anyone really think someone would start crying about currency defacement?
@_date: 2015-10-14 04:18:18
Have you tried this before? I have, and never got a response... my guess is that there are enough people that fall for these things that they just don't bother.

That's not really a good analogy, it's more like saying "Linux the company may fail, but the unix architecture is solid."

I remember reading that Apple does something similar in their quarterly report. This is known as a Canary in a coal mine.

Is this in reply to my comment? I'm unsure how it's relevant.
