Wrong again. Deflation is where the prices of goods will fall in price over time.  A deflationary currency deflates the cost of goods.  Not the value of the currency itself.  It may be counter-intiutive, but it is not wrong.

Regarding the Fiat currency part.  Is it possible that he just means that its not backed by anything other than consumer confidence in the currency?  
Yes, Fiat currency is backed by governments, and that is not the case with bitcoin.  But is it possible that its just the closest correlation that he could come up with?

I'm pretty new to this, but don't you have to put verify at the end to tip?

Actually, I think it means exactly what he thinks it means.  See [digitalh3r4mit's]( reply to my comment.

Your entire post was about mining for gold.  As for gold investors.  If something comes along and dramatically changes the market for gold (asteroid mining), then the investors will likely re-evaluate their positions accordingly.  You can always turn around and sell your gold later.  That may not be possible with Bitcoins.

Well, obviously the market for gold changes.  You can't expect any investment market to be the same today as it is 10 yrs from now.
Mining for gold on asteroids won't be profitable until the cost of operations is significantly lower than the sale price of the returned gold.  I don't see that happening in the next 10 yrs.
