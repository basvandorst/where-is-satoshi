CFTC has jurisdiction over a variety of financial instruments.
This wasn't about futures, it was about the jurisdiction of the CFTC, which is in charge of everything under the Commodity Exchange Act - this includes swaps, futures, and commodity loan contracts.

Hence the joke.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:19:45
No, that's incorrect. The problem was borrowing, not the futures. For futures, intent to deliver is enough. For borrowing (and thereby shorting) they needed to deliver.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:45:39
"operating futures trading without being registered"
"If there is intent to deliver the underlying it's considered a forward"
"The CFTC has jurisdiction over future contracts. Whether a contract is considered a 'future' depends on a number of factors"
I'm noting a simple point, which is that it's not about forwards, it's about jurisdiction. You claimed that if it's about CFTC jurisdiction, it must be about forwards. I disagreed.
Bitfinex does leveraged trading, swaps, and lending. Those are all under CFTC - which is why they were involved. That's why the rulings you are citing don't say "Forward," they say "retail-financed commodity transactions" - that's a leveraged purchase, not a forward contract.

Form the press release: "Bitfinex permitted users to borrow funds from other users on the platform in order to trade bitcoins on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. The Order also finds that Bitfinex did not actually deliver those bitcoins to the traders who purchased them"
As the earlier posted noted, see IV.A. It's not just defining or referring to futures, it's talking about where it has jurisdiction - 
"That jurisdictional provision broadly applies to any agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodity that is entered into with, or offered to (even if not entered into with), a non-eligible contract participant ("non-ECP") or non-eligible commercial entity ("non-ECE")6 on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis. 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(D)(i). Section 2(c)(2)(D) further provides that such an agreement, contract, or transaction shall be subject to Sections 4(a), 4(b ), and 4b of the Act "as if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery." 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(D)(iii). 
Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act excepts certain transactions from Commission jurisdiction."
That last bit is key - they would be exempt if they delivered (nothing to do with intent) - not because it's not a futures contract (it doesn't need to be,) but because it's explicitly exempted by law. What does that section of the law say? Glad I asked - look here; 
Relevant portion:
(D) Retail commodity transactions
(i) Applicability &lt;snip&gt;
(ii) Exceptions This subparagraph shall not apply to—
(I) an agreement, contract, or transaction described in paragraph (1) or subparagraphs [7] (A), (B), or (C), including any agreement, contract, or transaction specifically excluded from subparagraph (A), (B), or (C);
(II) any security;
(III) a contract of sale that—
(aa) results in actual delivery within 28 days or such other longer period as the Commission may determine by rule or regulation based upon the typical commercial practice in cash or spot markets for the commodity involved; or
(bb) creates an enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and a buyer that have the ability to deliver and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with the line of business of the seller and buyer; or
(IV) an agreement, contract, or transaction that is listed on a national securities exchange registered under section 6(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f(a)); or
(V) an identified banking product, as defined in section 27(b) of this title.

Lending is expensive in large part because there is time value of money,  and risk. BTC addresses neither of these. There are places where most of the cost of using traditional currency can be bypassed via BTC, but this doesn't seem like one of them.

There is a lot to say about this. A couple negative points to note that are frequently glossed over:
Bitcoin is still evolving - it may grow, it may stay where it is, or it may be discredited due to new technology or displaced by an alternative. Whatever it is, it's technology, which evolves at its own speed.
Security is hard, and so bitcoin security is hard. If your computer can be hacked, and that is where you keep your bitcoin wallets, your bitcoin can be stolen.
Bitcoin is NOT anonymous, it's pseudonymous. That means that unless you are amazingly good, people who care enough can see exactly how much money you have in bitcoin, what you spent it on, etc.
All that said, bitcoin is exciting, and looks like it is going places.
I hope this helps!

Ok, so set a lower threshold for difficulty than the actual to confirm that they find blocks,  and you can still verify while live mining.

It doesn't transfer virtual currency, it transfers the equivalent of a giftcard that can be exchanged at a fixed rate. This seems like a silly legalistic distinction - and that's exactly what it is, and what is needed for this to work. This is proved clearly by the link you provided, as I explain below.
The fact that change tip does not "provide payments to merchants who wish to receive customer payments in Bitcoin" (since it neither pays bitcoins directly, nor does it provide a way for merchant accounts to participate differently than any user,) the conclusion, that "FinCEN finds that, if the Company sets up the System, the Company would be a money transmitter", does not apply.

Currencies have value as transactional media;  that value is based on usage. If a new currency was expected to last 5 years,  but was used everywhere for billions of dollars of transactions per day, the value would exceed that of bitcoin.  And the way that could happen is for a currency not susceptible to 51% attacks by pools to exist, (done) and have a pool that controls 51% of bitcoin be hacked to exploit the blockchain,  say by minting tons of extra coins,  destroying trust.

Bitcoins are tracked in the block chain.  You can't lend something with a serial number.  It's like parking your car at a garage - it's your car,  you can tell if someone else used it. In this case,  you can see them using it. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:48:11
I was under the impression that the following could occur: If a block is produced that has a reward greater than 25BTC, it would be noted as invalid, and orphaned. If, however, then more blocks are generated in that chain, the extra coins will be in the network; if the chain is longer, and the cumulative processing on that branch is higher, other nodes will take that as the main branch - and the only way to remove them would be to eliminate all transactions that occurred since that chain was started; once other transactions occur, and some of those additional BTC go through tumblers, etc. they are not distinguishable from "valid" BTC.
If this is not correct, can you explain why?

@_date: 2014-11-27 04:51:00
I'm confused by several of your claims.
1) Bitcoin only has transaction value, so it doesn't have inherent value.
This seems backwards; if it's valuable as a medium of exchange, that gives it value. This is similar to any commodity; if corn is useful to eat, that gives it value. If gold is useful to make jewelery and electronics, that gives it value. If bitcoin is useful for transactions, why is that somehow different?
2) Altcoins offer nothing bitcoin doesn't
I understand that there is a network effect for currencies - but that does not imply that there is no use case for an alt-coin. Bitcoin doesn't offer very much anonymity ( and the significant energy cost of mining puts a floor on the transaction costs, long term. This does not mean that any altcoin will take significant market share, but clearly there are things that some of them can offer.
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:38:35
Yay! 
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:52:51
There is another mechanism that makes it less clear who owns what money. When multiple users use a bitcoin tumbler, or jointly pay a single person,  it looks the same as if one person with multiple wallets did the transaction.
That said,  the bitcoin protocol is pseudonymous, not anonymous,  for both transactions and ownership. If you look at the proposal for safecoin, which uses kademlia instead of a blockchain, you can find a better ownership anonymity protocol,  and darkcoin has a better level of transaction anonymity.
Remember,  bitcoin was the first blockchain based digital currency;  saying that there are details that could be improved is very reasonable. If needed,  many of these ideas can even be incorporated into the bitcoin protocol,  with a hard split.  (It's unlikely to occur unless the improvement is huge and necessary.)

Derivatives in equity markets help with price discovery. This is because the counterpart for almost all equity derivatives deals are delta (and gamma) hedged.
I'm not as familiar with currency derivatives,  but for commodities,  the futures that form most of the market are used both by speculators and by hedgers - so the function of price discovery is secondary to the market operations that are facilitated.

I'm confused - it's not practical to move $1m in BTC in any short amount of time - the price would go crazy.

Anyone with a decent undergraduate economics background should know better; read mas-collel and get back to me. You're right about parks,  but wrong about the application here. Crowding can induce rivalry,  but the two ideas are distinct;  each ip address is perfectly rival;  only one user gets it at a time. 
And network effects are a positive externality. That's why altcoins don't have as much value in the market. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:59:42
Just to clarify,  I'm happy to explain this more in depth, and I don't need your money. 
Regarding DNS. You are confusing something being rivalrous with the idea of externalities;  bitcoin has network externalities, so that me using my bitcoins can make yours more valuable. Similarly, you can benefit from my domain name,  or my private lake,  if I set it up in a way that can benefit you, fine - but my rights exclude others from controlling it or allowing the benefit of the good to be exclusive. (The term privatization refers to making public services privately run,  and had essentially nothing to do with this discussion. The commons were fenced in,  which made them exclusive - but most public goods are not "privatized" in this sense.)
Next,  rivalry had nothing to do with crowding. Each IP address is perfectly rival,  even though the set size can change. This is exactly like bitcoin - each Satoshi is perfectly rival,  though minting can increase the number of coins ( so can a change to the protocol,  such as occurred with IPv6.)

If the block chain diverged significantly in different parts of the world,  and transactions in some areas were lost,  it's not so simple to say that there would be no damage.  This could occur if the Internet was split due to the loss of,  say,  strategic undersea cables.

It's wasn't a "lingering bug", itwas a potential hard fork coded into the Pecos version. That earlier update made a hard fork possible, at the discretion of those miners creating large blocks.
Was this stupid in that case? Yes. But the "bug" in that instance was a limit to block size - literally the exact same issue as classic.
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:15:46
Any change to "the" source is voted on by the miners - they adopt it or not.  If the change isn't agreed to my almost all miners,  it fractures the network - so everyone cooperates by only making truly necessary changes,  and getting near complete consensus before rolling out changes that affect the protocol. 
So no-one has control - it's like any financial quantity,  driven by the market.  But in this case,  market mechanisms work towards protocol stability instead of price discovery.

There is a delay between the trigger and the change. That means that unless the 25+% of people who still disagree want to have a high probability of being left behind, they will switch as well. That would eliminate the potential problem.
That is the theory behind all hard forks, both those that have occurred,  and those proposed for the future - and you can dislike it, but it's hardly unique to classic.

@_date: 2016-03-14 14:58:44
So basically you want to make the system complex,  because complex cryptosystems are always so robust?
Of the top of my head,  here's a potential problem; In your system,  miners are now incentivized to preferentially mine for blocks that have hashes which led to future blocks their machines are faster for. Difficulty isn't similar among different hashes, and the blockchain stalls whenever certain hashes are selected for the next block,  leading to predictable delays, and various timing attacks.
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:35:03
No, because the economics select against it. Every time the lead changes, the non classic miners lose their block rewards. If they only have a 20% chance of being paid,  they can't afford to keep running their mining equipment - or they at least would see that they are throwing money away. 
And I can't review your math without seeing your code,  or at least the math you used.

I'm pretty sure that as it gets more widespread, if there is anything like true anonymity, the DOJ, CIA, etc. will have problems with its use for money laundering well before the IRS needs to get involved.
Given that dynamic, I think that anonymity will not be pursued strongly - the bitcoin community is better off with partial pseudonymity + official neglect than anonymity + massive legal problems.
If it comes to that point, however, the IRS can still tax incomes, since businesses will pay payroll taxes. Bitcoin payments will be like cash payments; possible for income, but under the table, and if the amounts are big enough, the people involved will be found via non-blockchain based investigation, and jailed. You might be able to hold bitcoin anonymously, but as soon as you try to buy something physical, the IRS can start asking about where they money came from. The same problems exist with cash, but the IRS doesn't see large scale fraud. This is because we can get the technical side of bitcoin as perfect as we'd like, but in the physical world, there are people in government with the legal right to use force that will undermine anonymity from the other side.

It's not a contentious HF if 75+% are all on one side. This is especially true since many miners don't actively upgrade their clients at all,  and are still running very outdated versions. They may leave their old boxes running core,  but the additional hashpower that comes online will all end up running classic. 
And core devs will release a compatible update if the HF trigger occurs, since they care about bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:17:13
An implementation of this doesn't require any changes to the protocol,  nor any messages. The node can create a table of balances, and unfinished scripts, etc. and discard as much of the chain before that point as they want; splits starting in the past should be very infrequent, and going back even only 20 blocks should be enough.
Of course, storing balances + unfinished transactions isn't nothing, but it's less than the whole blockchain.
Also,  you wouldn't want to syncronize balances all at once; it would create sudden network lag and problems.

Too late.
Several altcoins have fairly robust pseudonymous capabilities,  like darkcoin, and zerocash has provable anonymity. Additionally,  there is no willingness no implement this in BTC, since it would make all the investment in KYC compliance void,  and make BTC into a clearly illicit protocol. The companies that want to be involved can't afford to do that or let it happen.

It would be an astounding feat; the first time government wouldn't manage to figure out how to circumvent a technical restriction.
A government would need some way to influence a banking system in order to get around this.  Or they would need to compel software companies to change something about their software.  And those are exactly the kinds of things that bitcoin companies have been doing to comply with government regulations since day one.

Dude, you clearly don't know what you're talking about. You can be irrational on several levels. Here are a few.
1) Being temporally inconsistent - I prefer X next week to Y next week, but I prefer Y now to X now, and in a week when asked again, I will prefer Y to X, despite having the opposite preference for myself in the future.
2) Being logically inconsistent - I prefer X to Y, I prefer Y to Z, and I prefer Z to X.
3) Being gameable - You are logically inconsistent and will pay to do so; you are willing to pay in order to trade X for Y, Y for Z, and Z for X - anyone who has Y and Z can use you as a money pump.

It's possible,  just very unlikely. That may not be enough for you.
The question is who puts in the vulnerability. If it's the hardware designer, anyone involved could leak that fact, and everyone involved goes to jail. If it's a third party,  supply chain attacks are hard, and unlikely, but governments have pulled them off. If you're worried about the US government trying to steal your bitcoin because you're involved in child porn, terrorism, or something similar,  it's possible - but they are unlikely to burn a vulnerability like that to stop your drug deals.

Kind of, except that the hash power wouldn't be securing the network *more*, since the security of the network is a economic result, not a cryptographic one. That is, if it costs $1 trillion to pull off a 50% attack now, and prices got cut in half so that mining power doubled, it would then cost... $1 trillion to pull off a 50% attack.

If only one group is allowed to check who owns which "serial numbers",  a regular database is sufficient. If the general public can verify it,  and submit transactions, and see who has which "serial numbers", it needs a decentralized trials trustless data store,  ie a block chain.
(In fact,  it's not really serial numbers,  it's just tracking who has how much currency,  but it's a close  analogy for convenience - just appreciate that it's inexact.)
@_date: 2015-09-21 02:01:42
That's an interesting idea. I'm sure that if you started it,  the idea would... *ripple* through the crypto world, and it could end up being... *stellar*?
@_date: 2015-09-20 22:55:12
This is exactly correct;  if a single entity runs the currency,  there is no reason to need a blockchain.
So,  let's change the pitch slightly; the company backs the currency with their merchandise, (like a gift card), but lets anyone mine it and transact with it. It uses proof of stake, so that mining isn't really the goal,  as it yields relatively little, and the majority of the currency is owned by the company - and they control the protocol. This sounds more like what the author wants. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 14:16:02

Their conclusion is correct. Unless there is a business case,  it will be ignored.
Does the business currently spend a lot on transaction fees? No? Do they do business where anonymity would help? No? Do they need cryptographically verifiable payments? No? Do you know if a reason it makes sense other than these? No.

But the network isn't always in synch. If I produce a transaction just before I get the latest block,  what happens to it?  Is it just thrown out?
@_date: 2015-03-11 04:04:57
If they start with over 50%, everyone can see it at that time. And if they control more than 50%, I think they can control it only partially, since time elapsed is a factor in using the stake accumulated.
And the abuse of the currency is visible, so even if it's possible, the founders have an incentive not to do so. Once it becomes large, it's much harder to control than even 51% of mining power for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-06 04:01:42
I will honestly say it makes me very happy to hear that I was able to get someone to reconsider their native bias.

Good thing that countries can't regulate your use of open protocols,  or their development.
And your last comment,  ... what? You realize the open protocol had no ability to hide transactions,  right? I mean,  pseudonymous accounts are great until you submit a transaction from a computer with an IP address, or with any regulated and reporting entity.
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:20:59
But the score is an investment, which guarantees blocks weren't spoofed (cheaply).
But POS doesn't allow rewriting history; there is a shared consensus for history;  spoofing would require nodes ignorant of history.

That depends on the volatility measure you are using over longer time scales - and that's quite a complex area. If the currency steadily rises, the volatility over short time scales in very low, and that's the stability that most people want.
@_date: 2015-11-25 05:52:27
As long as you never use a computer with an IP address to submit a transaction, or use the bitcoin from a computer that has any security flaws, yes, it's totally perfectly anonymous.

There are some fundamental problems with having a system like that.

No one said it had more value - the future value derived from a coin doesn't get discounted to present value,  but future profits to a company do.

But stability is useful - and btc prices have been stable over the short term recently. So merchants who want to can make sales and sell the currency in the same day, and have little volatility risk - they just need to adjust prices daily.

But even among professional technical traders,  studies show there is no evidence of consistent outperformance. It would be like if NBA teams were on average no better than any group of people picked from the street if they played a game.

Interesting. The problem is that you can have mining capacity go down too - and I'm unsure why MITM is an issue if you need lots of stake to fool anyone; it's a very expensive attack that relies on network isolation. It should also work on BTC as well; network isolation would allow attacks against the blockchain on that segment.
