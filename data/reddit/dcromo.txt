or first hand accounts.   
   
none of those guys are getting into BTC for the day trade. they'll buy and hold for it to go up more. or they'll make money on the short.  
   
are there some people, individuals maybe, within that newsroom that might attempt to buy one day when they know news will make it slide, maaaaybe.but none of  these stories are making it move that much anyway 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:10:26
I'm telling you right now no one in those news rooms, no editor, no journo is writing an article if they even for a second thought there was a conflict of interest or that it would benefit their employer or anything like that.
Sure prices move on news but this kind of my paper will say this so it can buy or the owner can buy is just silly.
Especially because these guys are wealthy enough to buy at any price in anticipation of it continuing to go up.

Oh man, i agree. Just saying that murder is murder. And you could intimidate the people extorting you.
And casually raising the bar from killing one dude to killing everyone in the house...well thats a bit much.
@_date: 2015-06-01 02:47:19
Lol defend? There's no defending.
People get extorted all the time and maybe it results in a fist fight. Murder is a big leap.
But okay, hes a kingpin thats what comes with that lifestyle. 
Listen as much as i disagree with drug laws, any argument put forth for harm reduction etc is weak. 
It is what it is. Dont do the crime if you cant do the time. Something that should be considered when committing crimes.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:01:34
No it wasnt a bait and switch. Its a pretty common way to arrest/charge people. And to help elicit a confession.
Bait and switch...you're kidding me. And the guy was potentially violent/violent.
He ordered someone's execution and was shown pictures verifying it happened.
Don't play it down.

People really dont confess to shit that they don't do. And someone with enough knowledge of it would be smart enough to not use the computer they caught him with unless you were reaping the profits from using said computer.
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:02:10
In what sense?
He seems pretty open that it was him. 9 out of 10 times the person who you think did the crime, did the crime.

lol BTC isn't going anywhere.  
    
edit: as for the offshoots and start ups around crypto that around BTC or Ether. Meh, maybe, maybe not.
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:02:56
Definitely. And establishing we're playing in the court is fine, as long as there's no illusion about it.

after all the incidents with this or that, i jsut wouldn't be comfortable with a web wallet period. the whole thing is just ripe with risk, additional risks really that are unnecessary. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:57:59
actually to be fair, i dont think people get this but there's a decent amount of oversight with these programs. the cia exists to protect us against foreign threats and generally with all the shit they are doing across the world don't have the resources to look at home. 
   
That's what the NSA does. I'm not naive but this is 100% used mostly in foreign countries and embassies and systems.
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:07:38
esp if brit backs out of the EU.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:23:00
actually, a lot of that happened because of flagrant abuse of regulations.  
   
sure, shit'll happen with regulation. the nature of Bitcoin sheds regulation anyway. but to act like BTC hasn't been the wild west of financial crime in the last 5 years is kidding yourself. 
   
and sure you won't stop everything. but it certainly protects the consumer a bit more.   
  
lol even FDIC insurance would protect a bunch of people keeping their BTC's on 'exchanges' if those exchanges were more recognizable to banks.   
   
and, imo, it's good BTC is the way it is. it's okay that shit like that happened as part of the price for a decentralized currency. but acting like regulation wouldn't have protected people or, and much more likely, at least created avenues for recompensation and *certainly* repercussion is just naive at best. 
   
although, I often wonder the difference between BTC, traded electronically and existing electronically as all that different from today's cash. except I don't have to pay bank fees to help it and can spend it fewer places and it's more volatile. 
   
but decentralized so that's cool.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:26:08
Sure, now there's more option. But at first, it always wasn't decentralized outside of keeping your money in cold storage, where it couldn't be used. 
   
Additionally, having to buy into fiat to spend the BTC also, and it will phase out otherwise it's just another commodity.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:15:09
yeah but this is different. 
  
 if he buys in at 50 and sells at 600...that's a helluva lot of money he just made. and he probably would have plenty to buy back in now neway. 
   
whatever filtered lense this is looked at through it's ass backwards.
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:49:56
Yeah, but the economic policies, which are arguably 'factors' are in the extreme. China has hit a solid in between of free market and gov't intervention. You could argue most modern western economies have.  
    
They're so solid, in fact, that when a major oil producer has the issues Venezuela does there aren't massive repercussions world wide.    
   
Collectively the global economy is so strong that a major leader in it can have a couple investment banks go under and a bunch others merger to eat bad debts in the process and the whole world doesn't go under, like in 08.   
   
I'm all for Bitcoin. I think the ideal of it, as this singular cure all/messiah complex approach is not only unrealistic but unhealthy. Nor does it lead to productive outlooks.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:07:55
Economic factors will drive inflation before a gov't will. At least in modern economies. People act like a modern gov't has that much control over an economy. It tends to be cyclic and not \*all that\* effected by gov't decisions. At least looking at the U.S., historically. 
I'd also then consider countries like China, who do control their currency for better or worse and their place in the global market. It won't be unseated by a digital currency. Ideal's are great. Realistic applications are much more useful.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:06:03
ehhh, sort of?  
When you think of how we mined different things out of the ground, it probably became apparent that x was rarer than y and z was rarer than x.  After it is assigned a value even, like one gold pound was equal to three bags of rice or something, doesn't mean that value would hold today for \~$1200 per oz. In fact, Gold seems so intrinsically valued for so long, that we based our currency off it. In a way it developed to be a part of its inherent value. Sure at very very first it's just a mineral but I think that's a naive point considering that people looked toward magic to try and create more of it.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:33:37
Invest it in stocks if you can. If you walk in and ask to open an account at a investment firm with a decent enough sized chunk of cash probably just ask you if it's taxed. Then just file the capital gains come IRS time.
Or buy a house cash. Should just pay your taxes though. Not doing it usually just leaves you a bill and a fine if it isn't malicious and avoided over years.

while it seems like a really applicable thing the problem wiht greece is that there jsut isn't money there anymore and in order to get enough bitcoin to 'save' greece you need to have enough money to buy it anyway.  
   
and frankly, this would be a problem with crypto or fiat currency. this was a problem of policy and allocation. arguably could say you'd have more failsafes preventing this situation with crypto but i'm not entirely sure that's true. there's things in place already and they still fucked it up.  
   
sorry, i'm all for crypto and love bitcoin. i'm just not that...like don't like all this bitcoin to save greece! shit because it's just not true.
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:51:24
Woha woha woha.
Currency creation is a super regulated process. And publicized for that matter.
Sure our system helps the rich get richer and the average to stay where they are and the poor to get poorer. That said, what frustrates me is out materialistic and consumption focused economy. Without changing that mentality youll never change shit.
Instead of blowing a tax return on something nice or a nicer version of something you need, invest it.
People dont do that. And frankly until bitcoin goes to the moon and we're all using bits in a reasonable equation to dollars bitcoin wont take.
I love and appreciate it as much as the next guy. Its a great idea rooted in some solid principle and executed as well as anything else. Now that it has an attached dollar value to it its just that and worth that much and not that different than the dollar off the gold standard.
Bitcoin will always be an alternative. It'll there alongside the dollar and euro and pound.
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:53:58
I hear that. Def be some positive attention
Then again, from a real marketing standpoint the average person will continue seeing bitcoin around and seemingly a part of all these conflicts/uprising/crisis and may get the wrong impression/initial idea and thats not good.

Maybe even Paris is fake. Just Paris plastered of Paris.
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:09:42
Yeah but it was beyond criminal. Still is. Plus they're all delaing in dolalrs while the average person is shit out of luck. It was a self fulfilling scheme that continued to make the elites and close circle around the President rich.  
   
Why would they even attempt to stop it? I'm not saying governments are all that great.  Government policy certainly can effect the economy. That said, in stable economies or largely stable econmies you don't get these extremes. 
   
I'd also suggest looking at China, if we're going to look at examples, especially of countries with similar policies of intervention in their own economies. China has had steady growth for 40+ years.
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:24:19
Yeah...so? 
   
China's has a lot of gov't interference though. Not quite capitalism. 
   
I agree though. Not sure why everyone kept trying to pursuade me otherwise.e
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:16:19
Yeah really. No one. I could damn near bet no one, not even people with wealth in those countries stored their wealth their.
Hell countries don't store their wealth in their own countries. They store it in American banks. You know why? Because they know American banks are tight as shit. Some European banks too for that matter.  
edit: Implying that the dollar is strong as shit. Why? Because, even today, our country is strong as shit on our economy. It's really hard arguing against something that left the gold standard because  it inherently gained that much value being where it was from and the economy it was based on.
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:07:37
No one with wealth stored their money in those countries though.  
   
That premise, right there, is absurd. Even the government and elites of Argentina right now are dealing in dollars.       
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:47:44
What? Im so confused. Is that socialism? China has government influenced economic policies but its less socialism and more federalism. Sorta.
Im not sure i get the point people are trying to make. Theres a range of good examples of governments and their approaches that create good economies.
A few bad ones but they tend to be outliers.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:19:47
Lol, don't make some ambiguous comment and be like all welp, nope?! or whatever point you're making.   
   
Yall made some cherry picked negative points. Comparatively it's not all gloom and doom. That's all. You can't just disregard it because it doesn't fit the point you're making.
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:17:25
Lol, what!?!? 
   
Let's pretend?  Dude, what are you talking about?  China has also made leaps and bounds to bring a ton of people out of poverty and into the middle class.  
   
Millions of people, literally. Hell. governments are doing so good at the moment, either through a less is mroe no touch approach, gentle nudges, or all out control in first worlds nations that something like 150,000 people every *day* come out of poverty.  
   
 Don't impart problems we consider serious, like wealth inequality onto a nation and culture that doesn't really give a shit about it. Especially a culture who really only care about improving their occuntries stature inu the world. 
   
Just saying, no way of thinking in absolutes.
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:01:32
solid advice for people who believe in bitcoin for the long run. 
    
i'm not suggesting and idiot should, but the bubbles and rides are relatively easy to score a few quick bucks. but it tkes money to make a decent amount of money.  
    
it def is very realistic to make money off bitcoins volatility.
