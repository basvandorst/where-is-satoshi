Well, obviously drugs can't be used to initiate force. But you are right - it's similar to peoples' objection to child porn in a way. People don't like the concept of other people finding distasteful things enjoyable, so they try to forcibly prevent it.

Think of it this way. The increase in of your BTC is essentially the interest repaid on the loan from the people who *did* consume. When you have 10BTC, that means that you have given somebody 10BTC worth of something. If you don't need it right now, you can lend that to someone to consume or invest right now. With BTC, that just happens automatically. With fiat currencies, the government skims all of that interest off the top.

Setting stable prices is only one usage of a currency. It's rather trivial to implement on top of another currency anyway. Simply price things in a new unit, DBTC, defined as
1DBTC = (1 - r)^t BTC
r = devaluation rate
t = time since some arbitrary point in time

Is this your opinion of the best source of investment income? As in, instead of simply holding wealth in the form of currency, you can obtain a better return from investing it into a business?

Sure. Bitcoin doesn't stop entrepreneurs from incorrectly predicting demand and taking a loss.


Not *every* purchase reduces the available goods and services for everyone else, sure. Purchasing something non-scarce like a book can be thought of in this context as "giving up" your claim to the scarce goods and services that you could have bought.


How is that sad? If only one person in the world was willing to spend Bitcoins, that would mean that every single person who wanted Bitcoins would have to produce a good or service that was worth more to that individual than the Bitcoins they asked in exchange. Even if that person never spent them again, that still means that the person who owns them gets to determine the productive efforts of every single person who wants Bitcoin.


Sure. Having other people take your money certainly creates an incentive to get it back, or to replace it.


Inflation has nothing to do with it. It's having wealth taken from you that creates the incentive. Currently, most governments take wealth from people by increasing the money supply unevenly, which also creates inflation as a byproduct. However, there are lots of other ways to take people's wealth from them.


If by inflation you are referring to taking people's wealth slowly, not at all. Steadily draining people's wealth from them might make them eager to dump all of their currency holdings as quickly as possible, but if anything that's going to cause them to consume their wealth rather than invest it into anything that will grow. After all, if you consume your wealth as soon as you get it, there is nothing to drain. However, if you save or invest it, the presence of a steady wealth drain will come simply reduce the returns you get. You would expect *less* people to bother saving or investing if the return is decreased, not more.
You would expect it to lead to increased consumption and lower investments and savings, not *more*.

Look at what would happen if you *had* spent your BTC. Any goods and services that you buy now cannot be bought by anyone else. Thus, when you do not spend your BTC, those goods and services can be used by other people.
But yes. If "we" decide, for whatever reason, to increase the total money supply in an uneven fashion, those who do not receive the new money will have some of their wealth transferred to the people who did receive the new money. If you are not going to be one of the people who will receive the new money, it is then very much in your interest to try to trade your dollars for these machines, or for anything else that will store value whilst the money supply is being increased.

By not spending, you effectively are. You receive Bitcoins when you offer someone else goods or services they deem to be more valuable. Until you spend those Bitcoins, you're effectively lending that value to the entire network. The longer you wait to spend your bitcoins, the more other people can do with your wealth, and thus the larger the return you'll get when you eventually do spend them.


Well, there's not much point *never* spending them, but if you do keep them forever than everyone will be grateful!


Inflation doesn't imply that your total money holdings are losing value. Inflation simply means that the value of each unit is losing value. If there were some form of money where every single unit magically turned into 2 units on January 1 every year, that would imply that this currency inflates at a rate of 100% per year. However, you haven't lost any value - if you had 100 units this year, then next year you would have 200 half-value units. Inflation, by itself, doesn't affect the value of holdings. Inflation is simply a relationship between the supply and demand.
What *can* result in your total money holdings losing money is if the money supply is being increased and you are not receiving any of that increase. If the total increase in money is only given to some people, then there can be both *inflation* (as more total units come into existence), and there will also be a transfer of value.
However, the inflation is not the cause of the loss of value. The cause is the unequal distribution in the increase in money supply. In both cases, new money has been created and thus inflation will occur. However, it is only when the newly-created money is distributed unequally that people will gain and lose value in their total holdings to reflect the new distribution.

At what point would you say that the moon landing was *not* a good achievement - that it actually was not worthwhile? Is there any point? What if landing a person on the moon came at the cost of 10,000 people starving to death? Would you sacrifice every person on the planet for it? Are you even *aware* of the existence of the cost? Have you made a balanced judgement, weighing up the costs and benefits and deeming it worthwhile? Or are you just making decisions based on your primal emotions?

This question can't really be answered. What stops them depends entirely upon the situation. I believe there are good reasons to believe that governments will be unlikely to shut down bitcoin. For starters, it is hard to politically justify - not impossible, but I doubt that there will be overwhelming support for shutting down bitcoin. Furthermore, the cost of attacking Bitcion will scale roughly proportionally to size of the Bitcoin economy. Lastly, bitcoin doesn't seem to have any really good avenues for attack. A 51% attack would seem difficult to pull off - if it was discovered, it would seem likely that people would just blacklist government IPs. If it was being fradulent in an obvious way, those IPs would be blacklisted.
So I don't think that governments will really try to attack bitcoin, and I don't think that they will succeed even if they try. I might be wrong - we're all in uncharted territory here.

I would imagine that the value of each bitcoin will increase over time.


I think presently the network only contains sufficient precision to allow transactions of up to 10^-8 units, which currently is plenty. If and when it becomes necessary, support for further subdivision is not very difficult. In fact, it's so not-very-difficult that I really wish infinite precision had been implemented right from the start, or at least presumably infinite (say up to 10^-1000).


Yes. This is called "saving" or "investing".
Think about it this way. In order for you to get 10 bitcoins, you have to provide something of value to someone - you have to build something, or perform some service, or whatever. In return, they sent you a few hundred bytes of data. On initial inspection, that seems like a pretty crappy trade, right? Those few hundred bytes of data cost virtually nothing to make, but the goods or services you provided took you a fair amount of real effort and time to obtain.
However, in the future, someone will do the same thing for you. They will give you *more* goods or services in return for you giving *them* a few hundred bytes of data.
Think of this, then, as a loan. You are lending the "bitcoin network" goods and services, and in return you are receiving 10 bitcoins. The "bitcoin network" then invests those goods and services, and so when you come to cash your bitcoins in, you can get *more* than you put in.
Every time you sell something, you are effectively lending the world the use of your goods and services. Every time you buy something, you are effectively calling in that loan. Doesn't it now make *sense* that you would get more over time than what you put in?
So, please, buy 10 bitcoins now and do not spend them. Do work for other people and get paid in bitcoins, and do not spend them. The more people who save their bitcoins, the better. You are investing value into the bitcoin network, and that investment will generate a return.

I am sure that those questions you asked would need to be solved, and a great many other problems will also need to be solved.
However, I do not see a reason to expect that such a service would be totally impossible to sell to people. None of the obstacles you listed seem totally unsolvable, and even if they did, human history is full of examples of people solving "unsolvable" problems.

It's difficult to cut costs. Hard decisions need to be made, people have to be fired, unprofitable but popular products and services need to be cut, so on and so forth.

Money is simply a mechanism for coordinating the usage of scarce resources across time and distance. It doesn't necessarily impose any limitations, so I don't know how it could ever become limiting.

Hardly nothing. The early adopters are the ones who promoted it, who invested real wealth into establishing infrastructure around Bitcoin, who enabled adoption to grow in the first place. It's not really too late to be an early adopter, IMO - way more people don't know about Bitcoin than do know about it. Also, Bitcoin flies in the face of a lot of mainstream economics, so there is probably a long way to go before people are convinced that Bitcoin is real - there will be real profit to be made from investing before that.

If you use the definition that stealing = whatever the government says it is, sure.

Taxation, then, is not theft, if you define theft as whatever the government says it is.

I'm not trying to redefine anything. Try to stick with me here. I really don't understand how people can confuse themselves about this, it's really quite simple.
You have two people, A and B. A takes something from person B with force. We now say that A has "stolen" from B - that the act of taking something without permission is can be referred to as "theft".
Note that this did not involve governments in any way.
Now, as far as I can see, you only have two options. Either:
1) You agree that A has stolen from B - that a theft has occurred
2) You disagree that A has stolen from B - a theft has *not* occurred
If you hold (1), then you must also logically agree that taxation is theft, as it is conceptually identical to that scenario.
If you hold (2) instead of (1), then I will agree with you and we have not been communicating effectively. Taxes are not theft, when theft is defined as the act of violating the law of whatever government claims jurisdiction over the land you happen to be standing in.
I would predict that most people, when polled, would hold (1), and that if you do *not* hold (1) then you will struggle to effectively communicate with the majority of people. When you use the word "theft", most people will mentally decipher that into (1) above - the act of taking someone else's property with force. They might argue about whether they have to a right to that property or whatever, but once something has been identified as a person's property, to take it with force is theft.
(The most frustrating thing is that technically, none of this is really theft - it's extortion, but s/theft/extortion if that's a problem for you).

In a free market, people would naturally be more careful where they placed their money. After all, if they invest in a risky bank, they stand to lose a lot more money. With the FDIC, though, customers do not really care about how risky a bank is, and instead just put their money in whichever bank generates the highest return.

Regardless of your investments, the government will still take a large portion of your wealth every year via inflation. Mortgages must be paid, food must be bought and transactions must be conducted. The government is constantly taking 2% of all of that wealth. For the many people that do not save and invest a significant proportion of their income, that means the vast majority of their income is taxed via inflation.


In what way is it not good for society? Obviously, it is in the interest of some of the members of society, so it is at least somewhat in the interest of society.
Precisely whose interests are being harmed when people save their money instead of either spending or investing it?


With inflation, of course. If there is no inflation, then the only argument against it is the opportunity cost. There are many non-stupid reasons why someone might choose to save money instead of investing it, and there are some stupid reasons. The act of saving itself is not something that can be called "stupid" - it's simply one course of action with pros and cons compared to investing or spending it on consumable items.

I don't see what else I could treat the government except as a set of individuals. What else could it be? I don't believe in any reality except the physical, FYI. The only entities that have agency in this world are human individuals, and we only interact via physical interactions - through touch, smell, sight, etc.. All interactions relevant to this point happen as a result of the efforts of individuals. All of the manifestations attributed to the "government" are, in reality, the actions of individuals. There's no magic involved anywhere.


According to which theory? In a democracy, the government is run by popular vote. By definition, that only requires the support of &gt;50% of the population. Fully half of the population may not agree. If a government were to be run by 100% votes, I could agree with you. Whilst the requirement is simply greater than half of all voters, the claim that they represent everybody seems wrong at face value.

But you're contradicting yourself. How could you possibly claim that people who vote against the government are represented by it? If someone abstains from voting in every election, how could a government possibly claim to represent them? It doesn't make sense.
Some people clearly do not have a government that represents their interests, so much so that some people go to jail or leave the country instead. It seems impossible to claim that someone is being represented by the very people placing them in prison!


I mean ... fine, but that's a very different claim from stating that the government actually represents everyone, and that taxation isn't theft. If you would like to term taxation as a *pragmatically necessary* theft, I could understand that position. There are many necessary evils in this world, and I can most certainly see a valid argument that taxation is one of those necessary evils.
Yet to deny that it is theft at all is rather baffling. It is the obtaining of property against the will of the owner - it is theft. It's really not any more complicated than that.

Doesn't who want money to inflate? If you mean every single person, then no - many people do not want money to inflate.
What do you mean by "slows down"?
Inflation, by itself, does nothing. If each person receives some of the increase in supply proportional to how many they already have, there would be inflation, but there would be no effect on the value of each person's holdings nor their ability to purchase goods and services.
However, the major source of inflation in the modern era is government increasing the money supply in an **un**even way - it's quite complicated, but generally the government increases the supply but keeps *all* of the increase in supply. What this does is give the government more wealth by lowering the value of all other money in existence.
If there were $10 in the world held by 10 separate people, each dollar is worth 1/10 "value points" and each person has 1/10 "value point".
If the government then created a further $10, there are $20 in total and thus each dollar in existence now becomes worth 1/20 "value points".
If the government now gives each person $1 now, each person would have $2 = 2 * 1/20 = 2/20 = 1/10 "value points". 100% inflation has occurred, but each person still has the same total wealth (or "value points" in this silly example).
However, if the government had created $10 and given it to themselves, each person would now only have 1/20 "value points", whilst the government would have 10/20 value points. By doubling the money supply and giving it all to themselves, the government has taken half of everyone's wealth.
@_date: 2013-05-31 04:35:13
I think they are referring largely to the period over the last hundred years or so. I know there are arguments that the long-term decrease in the value of a dollar has only existed for a century or so. Prior to that, the dollar may have gained or lost value over short periods, but stayed relatively constant over the long term.
I don't know enough about it to argue in favour or against it - however, I would imagine that it is in that context Crimsoneer meant "the dark age of inflation".

The issue I have with your comment is "they". Who is "they"? The government is not a self-aware entity capable of altering the world. The government is essentially a set of ideas contained within people, and the actions that they take as a result of those ideas.
One effect of humans trying to implement the government idea has been the creation of central banking which has resulted in inflation - the wealth of everyone using the currency being transferred to other government-based organisations. I do not actually believe any single person intended for this effect to be created. In fact, I believe that many (most?) of the people involved in the creation would deny that this effect even exists.
Now, you correctly observe that the widespread adoption of Bitcoin would seem to end this effect. However, I do not believe that there is any person who would object to Bitcoin on the grounds that it ends the effect of transferring wealth to the government. In fact, I think to understand how and why the effect exists would result in a person objecting to the effect existing at all.
I could very well be wrong. There may be some evolution in mainstream political and economical thought such that Bitcoin is perceived to be a grave danger for some reason (though I believe it quite unlikely that any such reason will be logically valid). In that case, people who ascribe to those beliefs may very well try to shut down Bitcoin.
However, that is not inevitable. Perhaps the idea that Bitcoin ought be stopped cannot be incorporated into current political/economic ideas in a digestible fashion, and perhaps it will even cause people to become unsatisfied with the current models!

Why do you believe inflation does that? What makes you think inflation, in and of itself, affects behaviour at all?

Why would this alter people's spending behaviour? Sure, each person has more units of money, but so does everyone else. Presumably, it would wash out and prices would simply double each year.

You keep pointing at inflation as if it causes this. Inflation does nothing - inflation simply measures increases and decreases in the total money supply.
What you instead seem to be referring to is when there is an unevenly-distributed increase in the money supply. If there were an evenly-distributed increase, there would still be inflation but the total amount of wealth each person had would remain unchanged. If each person who had $100 received a newly-created $100 note every January 1, inflation would be 100% per year, but nothing else would really change. The numbers on all the price tags would double each year, but that's about it.
However, if the money supply increases **un**evenly, then this results in *both* inflation **and** a transfer of wealth from everyone who is currently holding dollars to the people who received the newly-created dollars.
When you say that inflation causes various behaviours, you are instead referring to the change in behaviour caused by constantly losing wealth. Since each person's currency holdings are constantly being devalued, you are correct - people are more likely to try to dump their currency as quickly as possible in order to obtain something that can retain value. They may invest more than they otherwise would have in order to attempt to offset the constant drain on their savings. Etc. etc.
So inflation is irrelevant here. It does not matter whether the total money supply increases or decreases over time, what matters is whether people are having their wealth taken from them or not. You could create the exact same behaviour with a stable or deflationary currency. To create the behaviour you are talking of, all that is necessary is that people constantly have the value of their savings taken from them, whether you accomplish that via currency manipulation or via any other mechanism.
You are correct that many governments currently drain people's wealth in a constant fashion by increasing the total money supply unevenly, which also results in the byproduct of inflation. The inflation is not relevant in this case, though.

Sure. You have to remember that society and culture all structure themselves around economic incentives. If there was an actual risk of people losing their money in risky banks, soon enough you'd see a *Two and a Half Men* episode about one of them losing their money investing in a risky bank. The people who watch that episode will become more aware, and some of them will become more vigilant. Maybe mothers will start passing on that advice when children are starting to invest. As the people who invest in less-risky banks become wealthier and more powerful over time, people start looking towards them for advice. They read their books, they seek them out at dinner parties, etc. The common wisdom shifts and aligns itself in response to changes in economic conditions - always has, always will. People in general are not so stupid about these kinds of things, even if the only reason they are smarter is because the society around them is guiding them that way.

I think Ripple is an attempt at that. I've been looking into it, and the concept seems interesting.
I'm a little skeptical of the way that the Ripple currency is being distributed, though if that proves to be a serious issue the code can just be forked.

I thought the US Government created the Federal reserve, was granted exclusive permissions by the government and that the key positions were all directly selected by the President. I don't know how you could say that is not politically controlled.
How could the Federal Reserve be independent, anyway? It's not like the Federal Reserve has the ability to withstand an assault by the US military forces. If they did something the government did not like, the government could just pass a law and force the Federal Reserve to change it, and there really is nothing the Federal Reserve could do to stop that. There's not much point being independent if every decision you make is subject to approval by the government.

Good thing from whose perspective? Obviously not the person who has their wealth taken from them. If they *did* think it was a good thing, they could just send their government 2% of their wealth per year.
Inflation is only good for the organisations that receive the newly-printed money - that is, the government and the big banks. For everyone else it is strictly negative. It doesn't somehow mean that people have to invest their rapidly-depreciating money, or that the economy grows despite the loss of incentive to save money, or any other nonsense.

Everyone's fine with free markets when they make a profit, but they forget that the other side of a free market is the loss. The fallacy that people tend to jump to is that it is somehow possible to preserve the profits of the free market whilst somehow getting around the losses.

... Why would I leave the country? If I don't make a product that other people want to buy, I don't have the right to force them to either buy it or leave the country. I certainly don't extend that right to anyone else, either. If some bureaucrats think they do have the right to force me to buy their services or leave the country, I feel no moral obligation whatsoever to indulge them and flaunt whatever silly demands they want to impose on me.


I'm not going to sit down and read through thousands of pages of design documents for the next iPhone, either. Do you think that is an argument that we need politicians to design iPhones?
One of the biggest strengths of the market is that people who are experts in something can sell that expertise to other people, thus freeing those other people up to become experts in other areas. With this specialisation, or "division of labour", we accomplish far more than we could individually.

Let's just look at that part first. The main way to do this is by offering a good or service that the person perceives to be of more value than the money you ask for it.
The "Without inflation" part of your question implies that you believe that inflation encourages people to spend money. What reason do you have for that belief?
It seems trivially falsifiable. Imagine that inflation were occurring because every dollar became two dollars on January 1st each year. It would seem absurd to propose that people would become somehow encouraged to spend money in this situation - whilst I have twice as much money, so does everyone else. However, inflation has clearly occurred.

What are you talking about? Anyone who thinks investing requires no work can certainly try their hand at it.

If you have money, what that means is that you have produced real goods and services for someone else in order to obtain that money, yet you haven't received any goods and services of your own. You could say that you are "owed" 1BTC worth of goods and services. The longer you wait to cash in that claim, the more there is for other people to use. You are rewarded for that - the longer you wait, the more goods and services your 1BTC will get you.


Not necessarily. What happens if that 1 unit would have turned into 2 units naturally?
You might think that I'm being silly, but it's to illustrate a point. Inflation does nothing in and of itself. It is simply a result of changes in the money supply (or demand). It is *those* changes that can affect how much money people have, not the resulting inflation or deflation that might occur.


Inflation does not occur because people arbitrarily decide that things will cost more. Inflation occurs when the money supply increases. Money is a good like anything else, and the price of money is influenced by supply and demand. If the money supply increases, the price will decrease, and we call that "inflation". Since money has value inversely proportional to the total money supply, any increase in the total number of monetary units decreases the value of each individual unit.
The machines all cost more because some new money has been created. If someone created that money and kept it all to themselves, then yes - everything is now relatively more expensive for you. If someone created that money but gave you a share of the new money to offset the value you lost because of the increase in supply, than everything is relatively the same price.
Inflation is a side-effect. It is changes to the money supply that affect how much each unit is worth.

The value of money doesn't necessarily change people's behaviour. Changes to the value of people's total currency holdings certainly change behaviour, but changes to individual units only affect that if the person's total currency units do not increase to offset this.

The way a price *becomes* stable is through the actions of speculators. No-one needs to "figure out ways to stabilize it". The reason that Bitcoin is comparatively volatile at the moment is because it is so new and no-one really knows what the value of it will be tomorrow. When people start figuring that out how to better value Bitcoin, the price will stabilise.
A stable value is not something you can force.
