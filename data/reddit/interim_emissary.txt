you can stay mad bro.
 i'll bet you $500 that the battlecoin has a negligible long term effect on doge.

Looks better than what Newsweek has

Sorry, I was just adding an addendum to your comment that although, yes, contemporary computation will not crack 256-bit encryption, there is a potential possibility that quantum computers might, even though currently it also seems like that too seems unlikely. Just some thoughtful trolling.

Nah bro, capitalism, muh freedoms, and the free market have spoken. More money = more smart, better, worthier, etc.

I love how insecure is when it comes to altcoins, especially doge. It's like you guys are all secretly afraid of it.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:30:44
It's cute how you guys think battlecoin can touch doge. doge is too big. And Battlecoin itself is just another scamcoin that is going to take advantage of bitcoiners hate/fear of altcoins to make a profit. GG nerd.

Because Apple is a company that craves control over the consumer and bitcoin would undermine that. When will you figure that out and start using Android instead of pointlessly complaining?

You pay a $5 tip on a $30 dollar meal,  not for a comment on a public forum.

Not at all. overstock is the first major online retailer to accept bitcoin, and given the billions of dollars of bitcoin in circulation, this is an extremely small turnout for such a historic event, especially since the vast majority of the purchases were done to support bitcoin.

you mad bro?
"In a couple of weeks" will have more subscribers that r/bitcoin. 
have fun back on earth while we are on the moon

Yeah,  pretty underwhelming,  especially since it'll fall a lot once the buzz wears off.  That said,  4% isn't bad for a pretty shitty online store with a radically different demographic than the typical bit coin user. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:33:57
bro, do you even compute parallel superpositions via quantum computing? get rekt nerd
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:26:43
mine too bro, fuck tha modz for real
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:47:29

Why does he end up talking to her? Call cops, stay inside, make her leave.  End of story. 
I'm calling bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:52:59
I understand completely what you said.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:31:35
