When you execute a transfer from your GDAX wallet to another wallet GDAX pays the cost of the transfer out of their own pockets at no cost to you.

Nothing. GDAX pays for your transfer off their site.

You're greatly over simplifing timing the market.

We always praise the BTC devs for the amount of testing they do to keep the blockchain bug free. We should be also doing the same for service providers.

It all depends on the interest rate of the loans. I have 10k in loans at 2.5%, that's essentially free money when you factor in inflation. No way I'd sell my BTC for such a low interest loan, but maybe I would for a loan closer to 10%.

I believe OP was talking about loans that he could keep after college. If you have to pay your loans by the end of the year then yeah, you don't have much choice not to.
If you can push them to past this year, and the interest remains low, the question becomes are you willing to bet BTC goes up a higher percent then your student loans interest rate. Overall it's a risky bet and paying off your student loans is the more reasonable decision, ecspecially if they are over 3% interest loans.

I agree. CoinBase might have more complexity as they are a larger exchanges, but don't know that for sure either.

So what you are claiming is you can perfectly time the market to understand peaks and valleys? There is no day trader in the world that can do this consistently, year over year. Even if you could you are going to get raped by short term capital gains marginalizing most profit. You should read more classic investing books where this is detailed.
Happy trading :)

It's true. You can read on this in traditional stocks as well. Index funds beat managed funds 9 our of 10 times. If you take the 1 time they get beaten, that same managed fund can't do it again the following year, showing that trading is mostly luck. It's impossible to accurately time the market.
Essentially, time in the market beats timing the market.

I've been in software development for 7 years. I prefer slow and thorouly tested over quick and dirty, ecspecially when we're are talking about a platform that houses assets worth millions.

You aren't getting it. Of course traders have made a lot of money, the market is up over 1000% in the last year, you would have to be an idiot to have not made money. The truth is no trader has beaten the 1000% return that someone who bought and held for the last year would have seen.
TLDR Hodl; don't listen to traders and their BS.

Not to get too personal, but what were the loan interest rate (s)? Did you factor this into your decision? Congrats! I've only got 10k more myself, I know the feel.

You'll get your BCH on Jan 1 from Coinbase. They should have sent you an email around the time of the split describing what to expect.

I understand we pay them and agree we should demand good service in return. I just don't think we know enough about how much Dev work and QA go into this roll out and shouldn't act like we do. We wimply don't have enough knowledge to say it should or shouldn't be done.

There are very few, if any, day traders that beat the 2017 BTC market return.
