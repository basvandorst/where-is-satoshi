It seems like people always talk about how bitcoin can cripple the predatory nature of the current economical model and that it can ultimately free us like some sort of messiah and shit. But in reality most people, including this sub, only really care about the price and gaining profit out of the volatility. At first I thought that bitcoin could really make something happen but as time went by my expectations became lower and lower. And now that I know more about politics and economics I am now certain that bitcoin can never beat the dollar.

Yeah but the problem I had when I tried to verify at CEX I had to verify my phone and card info by transacting few cents and inserting the correct amount at their website. But the money that was transacted will be converted to my local currency(KRW)+fees so I just gave up.
