Back in the old days of 2009 was satoshi idea to relay messages with bitcoin transactions by IP (and not by public address like we do today) the downside is that both parties should be online and know each other IPs to send messages over with the bitcoin.

They MINE bitcoin and usually buy food and essentials from amazon with gift cards.
Venezuela is completely fucked up due to the massive socialist policies and dictatorship.
Electricity is heavily subsidized by the government and is almost free so people mine, but if that same government catches you mining you go to jail and the charges are "subversive" citizen

There's ecdsa, secp256k1 and a sha2 and another sha2 (of the previous result) to generate a key pair. The encryption is very solid.
The only thing that can break this is a purposely built quantum computer designed just for that (imagine a quantum ASIC) but when this time come SSL and any other form of cryptography will be long gone or already broken and obsolete and new quantum proof algorithms will be in use

In 10 years? Probably only quantum computing

Just if OP thinks about this route, I worked in a Swiss bank before the first rule on the form when an account is open is exactly if the person is a US citizen or permanent resident. If the answer is yes a completely different process takes place and I can guarantee you that the US government will know immediately what you did.
Also transferring more than 100k at once will raise some eyebrows in a lot of places so be smart do your research

If you have hints it’s doable
1) old passwords from that era 
2) last pass generated? How many characters? There’s no true random, password generation has always a pattern (lowercase, uppercase, special characters, numbers) if you known what was and what wasn’t in your password generation rules it eliminates a lot of possibilities
3) if the password has like 8 characters and you can provide the info above could take from a few minutes to days cracking with my GPUs, if the password has up to 10 chars we talking 3-4 years. 14+ chars = RIP

Yes it is easy to extract it, that's why you should consider better options for long term storage. jaxx is fine doing what it proposes a hot wallet for active trading.
Be in control of your own private keys with a wallet that supports custom fees and run a full node! Try green address that supports segwit addresses

Bitcoin is not anonymous at all nor is the internet in general nor social media, a better question would be would anonymous currency succeed without the need for money laundering and/or dark net activity?

They did the exactly same thing when Bitcoin classic forked last year
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:54:19
Yeah they support B2X

If you pay less than 0.10 USD per kW/h yes you can mine. GPU mining ethereum/Zcash and converting it to bitcoin. At today prices you get your ROI back at around 220 days.
Look up on YouTube some rigs, study it a little bit. See what's best for you

If you got a quantum computer there's no need to mine anything, you just break the private key and get all the coins out from fat wallets

Why not open bazaar?
Keep it decentralized son!
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:40:34
It’s a new decentralized marketplace, currently on beta.
Open source, no fees(despite miners fees of course)
Started testing today looks pretty neat
TLDR 
Bitcoin eBay (but not quite Silk Road/alpha bay)

They would be much faster to crack SHA2 cryptography (which mining is based on with bitcoin) which would exponentially increase difficulty and also have the power to steal funds... anyway with those powers in hand (quantum computing) you would be breaking other stuff (like banks) instead of crypto currencies I suppose....

It helps the network, specially if you have port 8333 open and receiving connections. About using a full node economically is to protect your own money, not using third party apps (like svp wallets) Jaxx for example could just name B2X as BTC and you lose all your hard earned magic internet money.
If it’s secure doesn’t matter if it’s on the cloud, everyone should run their own full node to protect themselves against these kind of attacks.

If you want a hassle free experience just buy and hodl. But if you are a bit computer savvy and pay cheap electricity mining will be better on the long haul and if things go south you can always sell the hardware. There's no way around it, you have to do some math do see if it's worthy for you

If he still have the original HDD or the computer he first made the purchase digital forensics may be able to recover the files if they were not overwritten overtime. It's very unlikely but there's a chance.
