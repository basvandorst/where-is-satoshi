You can either just post your address or QR code and people can donate, or you can use a 3rd party processor like Bitpay or Coinbase :)
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:15:52
That's hilarious
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:31:49
I figured he was referring to the blockchain itself as the original innovation.
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:49:38
Wow very interesting, I got a lot of reading and thinking to do.
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:40:55
This is promising, and he has also been responsible for Pass Through shares for ASIC.MINER, which went well...but that's what many said about Neo&amp;Bee.  IceDrill is very worrying...why hasn't anybody involved come out recently and said anything or updated everyone?  It's millions of dollars, not chump change.

This is for all the people saying OP should be ashamed or be more intelligent than to post this:  
  
Apple came out and said that they didn't have any reason to believe they were hacked, and that the exploit was done via password resets.  Do you really think that Apple would say anything otherwise that would TOTALLY destroy their upcoming iPhone 6 sales?  What a biased conclusion.  The truth is that the public doesn't really know what is going on and in the end personal photos were leaked.  Apple has been in kahoots with the NSA in the past and we all know our convos are tracked...this graphic is proof of the public's sentiment towards more privacy and security.
@_date: 2014-10-18 07:05:25
I was going to say...I never trusted the new iPhone's encryption in the first place.  The sad truth is that regardless of what Apple, and other companies, say about their products and security we will never know the truth behind them.  I think there is a lot more of this going on than the public is made aware of, and that certain corporate sectors are virtually infested with secret orders by the US Government.  I have to assume that these products are insecure unless technically proven otherwise IMO.  They are creating a blackbox and expecting us to believe whatever they say is inside of it. Pfff..
@_date: 2014-08-04 22:32:50
Already exists
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:17:36
Why do you think it will fail and do you think there will be a successful cryptocurrency in the future?
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:22:04
Haha, very well done 
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:32:06
What is this trash?  downvote
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:47:50
Haha, serves the sucker right!  What a punk ass!
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:49:21
Went ahead and tweeted it
@_date: 2014-10-14 04:02:46
Renting it now! :)
@_date: 2014-12-08 07:18:06
LOL WTF
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:42:27
Hopefully it is still recoverable on the hard drive, even if you have to take it apart the actual disk might be okay.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:34:43
I used to like Spotify...had premium for at least a year.  Got sick of the songs...the only new stuff is mostly pop bullshit and a lot of classics are just not licensed so you can't listen to them.  It is good for some music, but in the end it just pigeon holes you into listening to certain artists.  Never the less, I guess they should accept bitcoin, as should all companies.
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:53:58
lol  
Post has been up for an hour--decides whole fate of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-06 00:05:35
The murder for hire charge WAS NOT dropped, just to be clear: 
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:48:40
Or savory... :}
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:20:10
Well I thought about Jeremy Thatcher the Dragon Hatcher, so there!
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:18:38
This place isn't just engineers and programmers...I also agree that the place could use a face lift.
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:52:45
Speak for yourself -_-
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:28:06
It is what it is.  I thought it was definitely over the top too and immature.  I decided not to visit the sub for the rest of the day.  No need to be so dramatic, though, IMO.
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:06:58
They are bashing it because it would be so easy for them to have added bitcoin as an option for ApplePay already but most likely they made an exclusive deal with the banks.  Let's hope that it is open and that dev's can make their own additions like bitcoin, to the tabs of cards.  In general, this is good news because Gyft and other BTC-&gt;USD loaded cards.
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:04:59
Thanks for the downvote :/
EDIT: care to comment?
@_date: 2014-07-03 01:19:44
So nosey...the amount should be confidential.
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:16:42
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:38:21
I'm pretty damn surprised they haven't done this as well yet.
@_date: 2014-11-30 18:01:53
Oh get over yourself.  Cringepics my ass.
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:41:37
Are you talking about my penis??
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:44:45
@_date: 2014-12-12 06:23:31
Welcome!  Glad that people have been nice to you!
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:51:58
Hahaha this comment made my day
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:47:43
Calm down, don't get your butt sharpies in a wad now.
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:50:10
Yeah but why spend so much?
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:56:00
Yeah that is not the smartest thing to do, I would have been more paranoid and done multiple wallets...hopefully.  Still, I don't think you can call him an idiot just because he made some mistakes...hindsight is always 20/20.
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:04:28
SMOKE IT IF YA GOT IT! ;)
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:44:35
We will find out on the 14th...he has supplied the info to a confidant have no worries.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:46:24
Ahahaha this punk ass!  It's about time we get some justice on this mother fucker!
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:25:19
Because it totally makes sense to trash this dude's store...protests are one thing, destruction of the property of the innocent is another.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:41:05
Why thank you kind sir (or madam!)
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:49:10
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:38:38
So what
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:02:53
Yall were probably attacked by supporters and scammers...I've never even heard about this purse.io crap lol
@_date: 2014-08-05 18:40:55
He did secure his bitcoin but they raided him after he typed in his password, maybe you mean he should have secured it beyond that?  As for the email address he did that once, which is enough, so I wouldn't say he was "actively pimping SR" and as for staying in the US it may have caused more suspicion for him to move.
I don't think you can say this guy is an idiot until you try it yourself and succeed.
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:45:45
OOOhhhhhh "real money", eh??
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:05:46
HOLY SHIT! WHAT!
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:54:34
Hahaha what a joke
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:00:26
Just like bitcointalk.org...HMMMM I wonder why??
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:07:08
uh oh, hot dog.
@_date: 2015-03-27 04:23:08
There is always a price to sell at.

@_date: 2015-03-31 16:18:40
I'd just use another fully anonymous crypto instead if you're that concerned about privacy.  I like Darknote but there are plenty of others.

Ok, who is Sandy Weill?
