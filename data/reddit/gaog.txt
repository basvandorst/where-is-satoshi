all in VEN then!
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:07:00
that's around 10%, I think you can get 20% if everything goes well
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:25:02
do you mind saying how much and whats your plans are? Sorry btw
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:07:28
we can do this!
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:08:41
yeah them enabling withdraws would turn them from villains to heroes actually
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:05:40
no, it would not
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:32:52
yeah this is the usual from villain to hero scam, works every time. 
Can you imagine that in a couple of months they are able to return more than 50% of the funds? HEROES!
Now imagine this happening a month ago with all diligence and good explanations. VILLAINS! 
yup, what strategy would you use?
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:57:41
Maybe hhis lawyers didn't really allow him to release any new information that would implicate new parties into this mess?
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:48:51
Whats the fastest way to get USD into the gox?
Yeah I know it is stupid but does anybody know? Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:39:58
maybe the government seized the funds somehow? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:30:49
we don't know, maybe this was an emergency plan, kind of to see what would be the worst case scenario like, in case that they don't get them back or in a long long time.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:42:49
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:34:42
I had my doubts that it was really him but now that you put all together... :( 
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:28:03
I don't think they lost them, they just can't use them right now. Why? that's the big question, maybe the government stepped in?
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:17:30
wouldn't this make it even worse?
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:53:13
and dealing with crappy razors, pfff life is hard
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:05:07
can I pay with goxcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:28:26
ok I bite, why not?
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:16:05
keep us posted next time!
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:26:40


what do you mean?
@_date: 2014-01-22 01:17:20
where is the too the moon guy when we need him?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:41:46
Yeah but don't worry the other exchanges are fine 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:09:35
he has upper management written all over him
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:15:25
Sorry that would have to wait until tomorrow
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:07:21
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:23:49
wait what?
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:22:16
no no, you are not but the guys who actually did that...
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:35:48
hey easy there! remember, he is still a human been 
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:34:34
I can see $400 !
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:27:45
cmon guys, if it was good news he wouldn't need to lawyer up!
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:29:20
Hey guys how are you doing today? 
Well, not bad, it seems like gox closed because of a problem with refunds.
Oh boy Im so happy that we automated that part of the process!
Yeah right !
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:38:35
 /5. Repeat
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:52:17
but but nobody died :(
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:41:52
yeah this doesnt make any sense, first why would he want to sell them? second one, he can withdraw his own coins, then why would he sell it on his own exchange?
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:58:12
let that aside, none of the responses explicitly say that they will do it. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:33:32
not GS, just a GS employee
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:19:28

@_date: 2015-01-25 23:50:53
