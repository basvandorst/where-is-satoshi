That’s not an answer, and that’s not the question.

No, I’m not.  The Summit supercomputer was not designed to mine Bitcoins but it is perfectly capable of doing so.  The very simple question is at what rate ?
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:52:42
“Probably” ,   “Very few”  Is not an answer.

I was aware it was over 27,000 GPUs but not which ones.  
I will put in some huge assumptions and come up with the nonsensical number I was  looking for.
Thank you for your time, and answer.

No, it’s not, it’s just another very wordy way to say “I don’t know”.
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:09:40
Don’t confuse “words” with “effort”
@_date: 2019-11-19 13:14:58
TLDR:  So you don’t know then.  ;)
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:44:47
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-11-19 13:15:34
Yes, they are both currencies.
@_date: 2019-08-03 08:55:25
Wow, what a difference.

Oooooooh, I didn’t know they could be disabled, that’s  very interesting, thanks.

Go to bitcoin.org  follow the instructions for setting up a wallet, they are very good.  I suggest a mobile wallet, preferably on an iOS device.  
When you transfer the Bitcoin from the exchange to your new wallet, it will no longer be kept on the exchange, your wallet is not a backup.  
There is now no one who can “reset your password” or in any way help you if things go wrong.  You are now responsible for the security of your money, completely.  Proceed with extreme caution.
Your Bitcoins are now not in the exchange, nor are they in your wallet, they are in the 12 or 24 word “seed” phrase (sort of long password) that you were given when you set up the wallet.  *** Write this down, very carefully, accurately, by hand, and keep it somewhere very safe. ***
For the sake of clarity, you money is now in those words.  If you don’t have the words then you don’t have your money.  If you let anyone else have your words, then they have your money.
Your money is now in the words.

There are currently quite small transaction limits on lightning.

It’ s where we need to be, but slicker on the phone.

Maybe someone should ask Wodger if he’s worried ;)

I use BlueWallet, no problems.

Gives you inbound liquidity too, to the amount you looped out.  Loopey about Loop.

There is obviously a FUD story of the year contest, and this is obviously a late and desperate entry.

Bitcoin is a truth network.  What value do you put on truth ?

I can help you, I am a Nigerian prince and can supply you with as much Bitcoin as you like at a discount of 15%.
First you need to send just 1 Bitcoin to this address: 
This will allow me to check the blockchain back channel and confirm that you are honourable.  Then through this channel I can supply as much as you need.

I suspect that there are several institutional investors who would love to get into Bitcoin, but can’t because it is too cheap.  Attempting to buy hundreds of millions of dollars on the open market would pump the price before they got more than 10 million in.
So this was a perfect opportunity for him to sell privately, letting big investors in and letting himself out, all without crashing the price and therefore being to his trustees, institutional investors and everyone else’s benefit.
But then he’s a lawyer, never met one with a brain.

Like every day.  So the funds on your LN node are like cash in the till, if you get robbed, you get robbed.
Then every night you loop the funds back out on chain, like going to the bank with the cash.
The additional benefit is that this will rebalance your channel giving you back your inbound liquidity, if I understand the process correctly.

Absolutely love it.

All 16,000 have been moved to the 14LuAvrRzAmeikgaafs7H5695xs5dVXqA5 address.

I couldn’t help but chuckle for quite a while when I realised they didn’t take Bitcoin as payment.
Talk about missing the point. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:48:33
Well Woger no longer seems to want or need the name so, yes, excellent idea. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:05:47
Or from Revolut to an exchange. 
So you’re not buying Bitcoin from them, just imaginary Bitcoin as a number in an account.
No keys, no Bitcoin.
