So I should let people calling me a scammer without any proof, even not a deposit of 10$ to try? The website is hosted in France @ [
I really don't think that my face would bring lot of traders.
It's not in French because the service is not offered in France. I did the same as Deribit, they are based in the Netherlands and they ban US and dutch IPs. Also, I don't want to translate, it's not supposed to be user-friendly.

You're saying about the 5%? Well it will depends on the lenders, if some lenders are willing to lend at a lower rate they'll have the priority.
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:15:29
You're IQ is so low buddy, if the authority asks me to implement KYC, I'll do.
You say I'm retarded because I can't secure the system but do you even know about 0-day breach????? No one can predict them, of course the system is secured but THERE IS STILL A RISK.
The company is based in France look at the legal section.

Smells? did you try it? This is not too late because contracts are completely different from those proposed by Deribit or Bitmex, where can you trade GOLD/BTC or even the DAX against Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:24:35
Then what do you suggest?
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:58:04
the future will tell us
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:13:06
Margin trading up to 1000 :)
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:06:17
What's wront with the quote? Bitcoin is not Monero. I can implement KYC easily but I don't want to be in the same case as Binance recently (leak KYC documents).
@_date: 2019-06-03 09:14:47
You can use this RPC command:
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:42:29
Yes but no margin trading when it wil be available.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:47:00
Why not oil specifically?
@_date: 2019-04-29 20:40:02
Here is a tutorial [
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:34:31
yep, otherwise it'd complicated!
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:37:16
Hello, you're right but if you've a good money management it can be good.
btw you can't trade Bitcoin because there are only BTC pairs and leverage is optional (no leverage = no liquidation).
@_date: 2019-05-06 14:04:23
We've no liquidity because the platform is new. Well for the KYC, what should I do? I can easily change this value in 1 minute...
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:22:00
Thanks Danny, I'm gonna first implement the ethereum side with addresses, wallet... and then why not the lightning network. Currently, withdraws are executed immediately.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:19:23
Nice, what's your feeling about the website?
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:21:26


Well, let's say 10BTC of volume for the month it's about 60K USD.
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:29:29
happy for you, 1BTC is a lot!
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:48:17
Yes it's working but no one is trading on it currently, you should try the ETH/USD instead.
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:56:38
Because of USDT, Coinmarketcap uses the average and for instance on Bitfinex, BTC = 5730 USD ;)
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:11:20
what happened? I don't think there's anything you can do.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:46:08
Hi, no, you can do it whenever you want. But beware, the limit for the 0.002BTC could be reached.
@_date: 2019-05-02 11:42:37
Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:26:44
Come on dude seriously, how can you deposit 1 BTC on such a shitty exchange. I've just released my derivatives trading platform and on 100 unique visitors - no registration while it's 100% legit, I don't get it...
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:26:19
Not really funny.
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:30:30
I don't think it will solve the liquidity problem.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:03:23
Ok I start the development right now!
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:24:35
There is an API based on the WebSockets [ Do you want a REST API?
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:17:48
They can lock your account and you would not be able to withdraw your funds. If you do this, use a little-known vpn server. But it's dangerous.
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:42:30
Yep many downvotes because of that.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:42:02
The RESTful API is alive :) [
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:22:59
I'm looking for market makers, that's why there is a rebate of 0.03% with limit orders. Do you know where I can  find them? The contracts are perpetual. You can find some explanations there [
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:06:13
yes tether = USDT and news are bad about tether
