Enforcement of taxes, registration for companies and miners, ban trading, any other ideas?

Read, read, and always keep reading. Start slow and never more than you can afford to lose.

I would check out nicehash

I use the usd wallet fine to wait on dips

No respawn

Not really correct

Before you upgrade read up all you can. Use the nicehash profit estimater as well. But most of all realize profitability of hardware goes down over time.

If you are fearful of losing $200 start with $100 or less and buy on dips. When you think the sky has fallen and you want to sell...buy. Start small to learn and remember if you trade you WILL have loses just learn to buy low and sell high.

Actually electric light was considered (and was) dangerous and had lots of myths about the danger. Tesla and Edison were on different sides. DC vs AC and they each spread rumers about the dangers of fire and death the others technology would bring. Electricity was not that marketable at the time.

JP Morgan's father was furious because JP Morgan invested in electric lights.
