This question is asked 100x per day. Do a quick search

I wonder what the business purpose that Chase Bank is using to justify this action.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:55:56
Chalk this one up to lesson learned. Should have gotten paid first, do the work afterwards. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 05:10:11
Hmm.. I wonder how hard to transfer Yen to USD? 
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:37:16
I highly recommend simply holding the coin and watching it's value grow. When/if the price crashes to where you are comfortable, just purchase more. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:27:49
Does this mean anything for the Russian based Exchange BTC-E?
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:53:51
That's it? What are we waiting on? Do I have to stock it as well?
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:01:19
somebody ban this guy. He's spamming this in every thread
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:29:13
I should have gotten him to put it in writing
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:01:44
I need to go talk to the flag store owners on 45th. Would love for them to accept btc for all that delicious beeeer
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:04:58
Sorry this happened to you bro. I have 2FA on my email but not on BTC-E. How do I enable it?
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:32:25
Nice. Where are you located out of?
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:22:19
Saaayy whaaaaat!!?!
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:48:03
Sounds like stealing to me
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:03:22
Just searched the App Store and nothing
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:41:09
Nice! I already downloaded it a few days ago. Didn't realize the two were related as I haven't opened it yet. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:12:03
Is it on the ground or is it in a secured wallet?
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:10:20
Nice! May use this guy tonight while I'm out DT

@_date: 2014-01-07 03:31:04
wow!!! I would suggest selling as many btc as you can on mt gox for USD. You gonna be RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:25:35
I actually asked my Capital One bank manager if my account would be locked if i'm using it for Bitcoins and he seemed confused as fuck
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:33:41
Damn! Bought a power supply yesterday with USD, would have much rather have used BTC. Guess i'll have to buy something else :)
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:27:11
That's awesome! Way to take a chance
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:48:34
He may not get patients paying in BTC for quite some time. But the fact that he's open to accept BTC as a method of payment helps it's legitimacy.

They went offline the day I completed the verification requirements. Now that they are back online, I will try again.

I replied back to my original ticket email and got a return error. I'm looking for the new support contact info to open new ticket. I've tweeted @ them in hopes of a response
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:54:25
Yeah this is USA fault!...wait
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:25:31
What app is this?
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:31:57
Seems to be down this morning 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:07:35
Lol...this can't be a real question 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:20:05
48LTC here...and just about to get my account Unsuspended today
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:19:09
Yeah, how can I get my 48 LTC from US Gov? I need my money
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:17:55
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:37:30

@_date: 2017-07-28 01:03:28
I would recommend just constantly averaging down when possible.
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:37:40
Thanks! I don't have that much on the exchange, but I'd feel silly not even asking. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:19:23
It's the fucking principle of the matter!
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:11:53
damn that's a rip!
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:23:55
Boom. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:21:54
I think I bought through a big sell wall because I was impatient
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:53:29
Does Coinbase have an app for iOS? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:47:38
Damn! I'm fine with the price of the BTC I purchased and it taking a few days but I only made a small initial purchase and with today's price drop, I want to purchase more and I'm locked by their first buy policy. Where do I find the delivered by date?

I just would like my local bar to accept a bItcoin as payment... One step at a time
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:55:45
How many days did it take Coinbase to confirm your first purchase? I'm 3 days in, the money has been processed out of my bank account. Just curious if I need to just turn off the computer for a few more days and stop watching
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:15:26
How can we get around them? Purchasing directly from the exchange? I love the layout of Coinbase but for christs sake I want to spend my money :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:42:59
hmmm... well... shit
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:30:24
If institutions start pouring money into BTC, what changes will see in price, trade strategies? Will they develop new exchanges and HFT automation? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:11:48
You and everyone else
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:23:33
Nice. I may head down there tomorrow
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:39:24
Why don't you try getting a job
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:00:06
Everybody should purchase a few dollars worth just in case... (so I can sell mine)
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:42:52
Still waiting on my first purchase to complete on Coinbase and they won't let me buy right now! nooooooooooooooo
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:43:17
Hi Rob,
There are 6 vendors in Austin that accept Bitcoin. If I am selected for the contest, i'm going to reward each of them with Bitcoin business for taking the risk and believing in the currency. 
+1 is a donut shop and I really want to try their donuts
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:42:55
good guy zyxxer
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:51:27
Nice! I'm in Austin as well. I could buy some for cash from you
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:52:44
Thanks for the advice. What would be considered a true bitcoin wallet so I can acquire one? I too have an account with Coinbase but would like to have exclusive access. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:44:21
I have to wait until Monday to Purchase. Maybe a good thing
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:58:10
The Chinese government maintains majority ownership in China Telecom. I imagine this contributes to why action was immediate.

When will the LSU v Iowa game be updated?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:31:25
Send me your login and i'll give it a shot. I'll forward you the BTC if I can get it to work

Fantastic! I need to come to Germany

Sorry man.. i'm being an asshole. I'm a bit drunk
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:16:11
My bank account is verified and I made a purchase on Dec 3rd. The purchase is still in pending status and CB has locked buying until it's complete
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:35:13
Nah I did read they were holding coins hostage but that was over 25 days ago. Unfortunately I don't think the answer has been given yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:51:50
Is there anyway to access it now outside of the app store? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:00:35
Me. I got drunk last night and spent about 50K on BTC. I figured I'd go ahead and start the pump
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:59:47
Nice! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:07:40
I'd like to buy one as well. I think they are around $20K?
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:55:45
Thanks! Ordering one now

Is it easier to cash out in any other currencies?
