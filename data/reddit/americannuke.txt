At some point in the past this already happened and continues to happen...not so much terrorist part but they use that as an excuse to clamp down on it hard.

It wasn't to a business, but wasn't to a friend either, as my understanding goes.

Thanks for letting us know that a comet could hit the earth. Way to stay on topic, genius.

First of all, they make it illegal by making a law...genius.
They can also selectively block internet access Bitcoin nodes.  The same thing Russia is doing with the Telegram app and the same thing was talked about with China blocking any Bitcoin transactions from going through.
Please go and be ignorant and clueless somewhere else.
Dumbfuck.
