Why would you want to live in the same place forever? That sounds terrible. And if you're stuck there and can't move because of your mortgage, that's even worse.

Fuckin right, I'm depressed. I was a buyer x 2 BTC at 12700 and the lowest print was 12712.

Maintaining properties and dealing with tenants, especially problem tenants that don't pay rent on time or at all, is a huge time sink and pain in the ass.

It's great that it works for you, but it's definitely not for everyone. I like the area I'm in now. I'm glad as fuck I didn't buy a house earlier in life, made it a ton easier to pack up and move out here. In a few years, it'll be the same with some new place I haven't discovered yet.

I'm pretty sure "they" didn't raise it though, it's indexed to CPI.

You can live for the rest of your life off 100k?

I don't disagree with you, and I in fact don't own a house (even though I could.)
However, you're forgetting one thing: no one will loan you 4-30x your net worth at rock-bottom rates to invest in "all caps world equity."
They will, to buy a house.

LOL, 90k. The limits for the social security tax 6.2% each from employee and employer) are $127,200 for 2017 and $128,400 for 2018. The medicare tax has no income limit, it's 2.9% (1.45% from each side) on all income, _plus_ an additional 0.9% on wages exceeding $200,000/year.

The state and city taxes are deductible.
But you're forgetting the payroll taxes: social security and medicare.

Sure, if we pretend that payroll taxes and state taxes don't exist.

Yes, but home values frequently appreciate at a higher rate than the interest on the mortgage. Not always, but often.

I left NYC in 2015. Only regret is that I didn't do it sooner.

Jesus christ dude, did you ever stop and think of what happens if god forbid something happens to you? 200 BTC goes up in smoke instead of going to your wife who now has to raise your kid by herself? What the hell?
