I see now what you mean by 'secured by capital'. I was wrong in my assumptions and I have to agree with you now that that part is true. Unfortunately I see this as a weakness, the PoW system has proven itself to be incredibly lopsided in where power ends up. Ultimately I think this system will fail.


I don't agree that satoshi himself intended for most transactions to be moved onto other layers. It's a great feature, but I don't think it's supposed to be the **main** feature, for most people to use. Nowhere is anything claiming the contrary directly stated. 
For clarification, I don't think the difficulty or proof of work is artificial. I understand why they are there, I'm just pointing out that they don't need to be, technically speaking. For security though, they do. Once blocks stop having a coin reward, this will be a poor system. The block size limit however, I do think is artificial. No other part of the system relies on it being there. No compelling reasons have ever been stated for its existence, other than "centralization", refusing to accept that mining power isn't affected, only node storage capacity. Of which we have lots. Especially if we need to keep so many miners around, which we do.
If PoW does end up being our best bet, there's still no way to know for sure if the best bet for the blockchain is as a settlement layer vs having it **be** the ledger it's being used as today, without further testing. It's a good thing we have one of each being developed right now. Personally, I'm not holding my breath for lightning, but I'd love to be proven wrong.

It sort of sounds like you're just making shit up.


What? Who decided this? You?
There's a disconnect between what you say between posts.
In your original post you state that:


I won't disagree that bitcoin isn't an efficient payment network, but it wasn't designed to be. It was designed to enable trustless consensus to anyone who connects to it. Despite that, that doesn't mean it has to stay that way.
You're failing to separate two of the pretty core ideas of bitcoin - the technical hurdle of how and where to store these transactions, and the social/political problem of how to grant people the privilege of participation, and claiming the rewards associated with that. 
The amount of mining power has **absolutely no impact** on how blocks are made. 
Bitcoin with lightning vs bitcoin with larger blocks is a technical problem, and proof of work is a social problem. 
This means that bitcoin with lightning and bitcoin with bigger blocks are still going to be roughly equivalent to each other in terms of overall efficiency if you're looking at electricity consumption. They are both awful in this respect, but they are what we have. Making a block isn't computationally demanding at all - but finding the nonce needed to adhere to the **artifically inflated difficulty factor** is extremely demanding. This is a social issue, not a technical one. Lightning does not solve this problem, so I'm not sure why you brought it up. Put in plainer terms, **lightning will not make bitcoin more efficient.** It just moves transactions off chain where it doesn't need to deal with them any more. Why did it do this? Because an **artificial** block cap is being enforced. Both lightning and big blocks could greatly benefit from technical improvements to bitcoin which would allow scaling at a much better rate. The social issue of who mines blocks is a different problem which will need to be improved in other ways.
The idea that bitcoin was designed to be a settlement layer was decided after it was born by people who had no hand in its making.

True, but that's not exactly a method of scaling, more of a consequence of a flood of new hash power entering the network. It's hard to do that, generally hash power shifts, it doesn't come and go. And there's no such thing as "mine harder" lol

You've left out that the reason so much electricity is being used is entirely artificial - it doesn't actually have to happen like that. Security can happen without such a huge waste of energy. Right now, we're just in a gold rush and the market has decided it's worth it to spend massive amounts of energy for huge profits.
After the last coin has been minted, the potential profit of mining will fall as will the number of miners as a result. Difficulty will lower, and mining can become faster, cheaper, and more efficient, happening only on specialized hardware. 
I can only speak for myself but I think the willingness of the average person to run a BTC node when the BTC network isn't what they interact with on a daily basis is going to be low. Wouldn't this increase centralization?

This is hilariously wrong, the rate of mining has nothing to do with the amount of unconfirmed tx's. Do you understand what mining even is?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:52:06
Wouldn't more nodes need to be run for sidechains anyway? Doesn't this data have to go **somewhere** in the end?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:39:39
I meant on a per-unit basis, one can't really choose "how hard" they mine unless they get into over/under clocking hardware or other means of limitation. But the point is that wouldn't happen, and generally the idea that (from the first post) "higher fees encourage more mining" isn't really a thing.. save for hash power shifting from chain to chain based on profitability

8x is a theoretical maximum. It doesn't jump from 1x to 8x immediately. This is something that's often conveniently left out. It would slowly rise over the course of years. Look at how long it took 1m to be at capacity.
The difference is that one chain still has 1c tx fees and the other doesn't. One is usable for smaller transactions and the other isn't.
Personally I think both are doomed to fail. The original BTC just isn't the most technically superior and I don't think it ever was supposed to be. (BCH is identical minus block sizes so I group it in with this)
BCH was 'bold' enough to do what it took to make the currency usable, by anyone who isn't rich, and whether the strategy of bigger hard drives and faster networks will work remains to be seen.
Shouldn't we let the market decide?

The reason for this is scary: it's because nobody knows. If they claim to, they are lying or have fooled themselves.
This is an experiment, and we aren't quite sure how it will turn out because it's never happened before.
People end up picking whatever side sounds reaonable to them. I've flipped flopped several times as the slow trickle of information makes its way in. Just keep reading, keep learning, and make informed decisions.
