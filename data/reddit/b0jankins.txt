I don’t think the cash app allows this
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:46:08
Keep it. Add to it. Hold on till after the halving.

15k 2022 
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:16:57
I think buying now and on any downturn for the next 5 months and then hold into 2021 through the halving and catch that slow grind to a new all time high. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:31:36
Personally yes I think during 2021 we will go above 20k
@_date: 2019-05-08 20:09:16
