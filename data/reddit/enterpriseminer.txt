A month ago it was $10,000, um seems like you shoulda bought then. You would be up over 30% with the opportunity to have sold as high as 20k.
30 days from now you'll be back here wishing you had bought at 13k. Mark my words.. buy tge dip, and HODL!!
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:02:06
You could use your Bitcoins to buy bitcoin forward at a 20% discount below spot price, the forward deferred delivery contract begins paying back after 180 days, 1/18th each month for 18 months. You automatically get 25% more bitcoins, ($10k =$12.5k)
Go to BitvestMint. Com buy as little as 1/10th btc and they accept MasterCard too.. You can also use your IRA, 401k or SEP to buy forward contracts at their sister site BitvestIRA. Com...
 Buy the dips and hodl as long as you can, start selling a little after it hits 50k

I'm sorry I just don't see it. The price of bitcoin would have to skyrocket a 100 fold minimum to earn enough to pay for any usable services that may be purchased with bitcoins.
At today's prices ($235) the daily revenue for all miners is just above $850,000.. Say 21inc's mobile users make up 10% of the income that's only $850,000 split that 75/25% is $212,500 split between a million devices = .21cents a day. Laughable, not even including the cost of electricity.
Imagine the payout with 10 million or a 100mil users. 
What I'm most surprised by is that this was the idea that raised $121 million.. 
Must've been some sales presentation,,,

As predicted the price of bitcoin not only tested the $600 range, but went on to hit our target of $650 and ultimately went as high as $725 before profit taking took it down.

Bitcoin cash is starting to worry me. Roger Ver is pumping cash into it to get miners mining and now Jihan has announced that they're going to support BCH mining in mining pools Could spell trouble for btc. I see a plan emerging where Roger convert 10's of 1,000's of Btc to bch and the mkt. caps flip. I must admit Satoshi nvr envisioned segwit segwit2x or lightning network. And Jihan does have asic boost, hmm? It doesn't work with segwit. Btc supporters need to push the price and need to sell whatever BCH they were awarded to staunch Rogers attack

I think a lot had to do with trump being elected from Nov to February, $700-$1,000 then March came along and Japanese investors hopped on the band wagon propelling price to $2200-$2,500 range then scaling debate agreement reached by miners at consensus 2017 trade show in NYC mid may $2,500-$3,000 and now segwit adoption, lock in, activation.. bcrash not having effect, brought us up from  $2,700 again to  $3,000. Now brokers are coming around which will fuel rise to $5,000- $10,000 December - March. Imho

Because it's no more than any other altcoin other than the fact that its promoters are trying to convince people that it is superior to btc and they are actively attacking bitcoin and the bitcoin core developers.

I'm not too sure that there's any consensus to any expectations one way or the other. As far as any concerns over a price decrease it may be based upon experience. Any market that goes straight up is bound to at least take a breather once on awhile. Corrections, profit taking are essential in any bull market. I'm pretty damn pleased with the resilience btc has exhibited over the last 6 months, been frigging amazing! Be happy, look towards the long term and forget about the daily gyrations of the mkt. Close yours eyes for a year open them and check the price. Repeat once a year and start selling some at 50k... Then... To the moon!!

You obviously don't understand how IRAs work. People that have $ in their current IRAs can't take money out without incurring a penalty and having to pay the income tax on the $$. Using a  bitcoin IRA allows you to maintain the tax deferred status in your retirement account so you can profit from bitcoins meteoric rise.

A market that goes straight up is much more dangerous than a market that has an ebb and flow. This profit taking/correction is a sign of a healthy bull market.  Smart money buys the dips. Traders sell when they think the price has encountered resistance, if the price drops they add more short positions until price stabilizes. After establishing new support they'll buy long. Average Joe investor should buy only for the long term. Gold 2.0-bitcoin as hedge, safe harbor, long term  investors should buy dips and hodl for 3-5 years. Ignore short term price gyrations add more as time goes buy. Check price once per year and start selling at 50k, then enjoy your life.

You're Still missing the point. People that have IRAs with other investments in them, stocks mutual funds, precious metals etc. Can sell out of those investments within their IRA's and use those funds to buy bitcoins, and instead of earning crappy return in gold can make long term investment with much greater upside potential. And at  People can buy bitcoins for their IRA at a 20% discount below spot price.

That's true for HTTP but not for all the protocols. Take TC IP for instance, invented in the 70's, laid dormant throughout the 80's and took off in the 90's. It took 20 years to catch on. And Bitcoin wasn't really ready for primetime until 2011, they were still refining the code and still are for that matter. EFT's and investment funds are another step in what will be a long road to eventual mass adoption. I do believe we have seen the last of these low prices, IMHO it's time to load up at these prices because 3-6 months from we will all be looking back and wishing we could buy in the mid $200's.

(Sorry but I have trouble believing it's ready for prime time in 2015. I see major hacks every month and minor ones to fill in the weeks between that. Additionally is constantly getting stories of individuals losing coins on a daily basis. As long as every day users losing bitcoin is a commonplace, I would argue bitcoin is not ready. My mom losing hundreds or thousands of $ is unacceptable no matter if it's bitcoin's fault or her own.) Hackers are not just targeting Bitcoin, the retailers and credit card companies can attest to that. I see the headlines I see the supposed losses due to "hackers" like Mt. Gox? Hmm? Not quite sure how many are really being hacked and how many are just being outright stolen by fraud or company insiders. I will say one thing though, Bitcoin makes for a nice target for nefarious characters whether they be ponzi schemes hiding behind a supposed hacking or outright fraud perpetrated by the companies themselves or a real hacking event. Bitcoin's ability to be transferred out of a wallet and leave little or no traceable evidence of where it went and  who ultimately received them is a weakness I can't defend.
(I've heard that every $100 down from $1,000. Don't say stuff like that, it's simply 100% unpredictable.) "IMHO" It's an opinion..

From what I understand the"vendors are the ones who lost their money. Maybe even the customers. Shouldn't they have been cautious in the first place?  Overly cautious??  Being that they were dealing in illegal substances in the dark web hidden behind tor and tumblers dealing with untraceable currency and unscrupulous people. You should expect this to happen. Just like drug dealers on the street, they get robbed everyday. At least they still have their health. This kind of business is bad for Bitcoin, the media eats this shit up, they love every bit of bad news about Bitcoin that they can get. Then they can point their fingers and say see it's used for illegal drugs and now that the "vendors" er, drug dealers got robbed they want to run to the authorities and ask for help getting their ill gotten gains back.

Not true, you can't use blockchain.info as a measure. If luck is up for a short period and the time it takes to solve a block goes under ten minutes then the blockchain will give you a false reading. Although the actual hashrate of the network is a bit subjective anyway due to the luck factor, you can get a much better assessment from bitcoinwisdom as I see posted below. The last posted network hashrate was, (see below)
Difficulty History
   Date       Change   Hash Rate
Mar 22 15  -1.50%   334,417,246 GH/s   &lt;&gt;&lt; Use this as your yardstick you will be closer than the blockchain calculation

I agree, somewhat, the premine was only 65 million I believe. and as I've been predicting and advising our clients in our Bitvest bitcoin round up newsletter.

We also predict ether drops below $25 when the SEC retroactively levees fines and starts prosecuting the ICO scammers.

You should look up Pyramid scam, you'll find that its just new money going to pay old investors. We pay with coins mined by our miners that were paid for with proceeds from forward sales. Its a much better to way to finance equipment as opposed to debt financing or equity sales.

We've been mining for more than 3 years, we have been offering bitcoin forwards for more than a year. we have never missed a payment and each bitcoin can be traced to its genesis and show that it was newly mined and awarded to one of the pools we use. The simple fact that we have ZERO complaints and that we have gone through an extensive due diligence process with the IRS and the IRA custodian should prove that we are offering a fair deal for everyone concerned. Its a simple trade off, time for money. We do buy miners with the proceeds from the forward sales and we do use the mined coins to honor our contractual obligations to our clients. We are well known to the community and have attended many bitcoin conferences as a an exhibitor.

You're correct, my bad. should've gone with it without the 2x.. (Edited original)

Don't try to promote anything  on r/reddit. And if you do be prepared to be trolled to death.

We have an extensive FAQ page that addresses the IRA/401k specifically as well as just about any other questions you may have. Including bitcoin forward options and buying direct without the discounts. We even have FAQ that goes directly to custodian for detailed answers to any IRA related question.

Yes, in my opinion it goes to the moon.. Eventually,,,,
ppl should be looking to hold on to their bitcoins for years in my opinion. Stop worrying about the day to day price fluctuations, buy em and forget about them. A few years from now take a peek and see how much they're worth, rinse and repeat every few years. When they're 50k sell a few... :-)

I know, we expect more from ad words/banners etc. but you never know..... :-)

We use the proceeds of the Bitcoin forward sales to purchase mining equipment and payout begins after 180 days has elapsed. Followed by 12-18 consecutive payments dependent upon the option they choose.
We have been successfully offering this product for over a year without one complaint. It is the best offer for anyone interested in buying and holding for more than 6 months to 2 years.

?? where's this posted?
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:35:51
Why don't you check us out before making a bold statement that is patently false.. How about doing some actual research, look up our urls, our corporation, find out where and when we incorporated. Check out the principles listed on our website. Search google for complaints. Search reddit for Bitvestmint posts. Do some real due diligence then come back to report your findings..

$800 drop?? From where, when? What exchange are u on? Anyone who has half a brain knows that nothing goes up forever. The farther you stretch a rubber band the more stored energy you have when it snaps back. This tiny bit of profit taking is not only healthy to maintain a bull market, its necessary. I wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin correct down to the $1,600-$1,800 level. My unasked for advice would be to buy the dips, never sell, wait a few years and retire.

No scam, just fair exchange,  we get new miners, you get substantial discount.

We sell both, bitcoins for immediate delivery or the forward contract, which by the way we have been selling for more than a year now without a glitch. We have been mining for over 3 years, have been offering 20% @  since March of 2016 Nothing but happy customers that saved $$
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:48:57
Screw that.

I'm so damn tired if hearing about how hard it is to secure your bitcoins. Give a frigging break already. In the past, there was a very serious risk of even the most knowledgeable bitcoiner losing their coins. Today only the most uninformed are at risk. Securing your bitcoins using 2 factor authentication or multisig or vault/cold storage services are readily available for the average joe. I am one that learned the hard way, being hacked by having my wallet address changed and the mining pool sent 56k in coins back in Sept 2014 was an eye opening experience I wouldn't wish on anyone.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:23:52
Yes that's exactly correct.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:21:03
If we were scam we woulda been outted by now.

Maybe you don't understand why this works as well as it has been for the last year. Everyone benefits, we get mining equipment allowing us to increase our hashrate without diluting the ownership interest of the founders. The buyer gets a 20% discount off their purchase. If you are a long term buyer looking to hold on to your bitcoins for at least 6 months to two years, then this is a better way to buy them. The fact that we have sold 100's of coins and have not had one complaint speaks volumes in and of itself.

Are we there yet?

Since we begin paying after 180 days, we can avoid the pinky up the bum. Hopefully..

Our reddit posts go back over a year, why don't you review those, then come back and apologize..
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:01:04
Er. Lol 
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:07:53
Actually you begin getting paid after 180 days, then you receive 1/18th for 18 consecutive months. Total of 24 months not 36.. 
My first reddit post over two years ago.

(("That's true for HTTP but not for all the protocols. Take TC IP for instance, invented in the 70's, laid dormant throughout the 80's and took off in the 90's. It took 20 years to catch on. And Bitcoin wasn't really ready for primetime until 2011, they were still refining the code and still are for that matter. EFT's and investment funds are another step in what will be a long road to eventual mass adoption. I do believe we have seen the last of these low prices, IMHO it's time to load up at these prices because 3-6 months from we will all be looking back and wishing we could buy in the mid $200's."))
Looks like I offered pretty good advice back then too.

We have been raising funds to buy new miners for over a year using these bitcoin forward contracts and have nothing but happy customers who bought at a 20% discount. For long term buyers it makes more sense than to purchase at spot price. And we are 3 year old mining co. With great reputation.
