Why do you believe this?

I don't want to go back to the gold standard, and I don't think (most) modern libertarians do either. I do think that QE is essentially equivalent to printing money, but admittedly I don't have a robust understanding of finance.
What I'm more interested in is why you have such an uncharitable view of libertarianism. Do you really think a majority of libertarians support the ideology because they hate poor people and think they (libertarians) will rise to the top in a libertarian society (excuse me if I'm putting words in your mouth, but this is the sense I'm getting)?


It's true that libertarianism is ultimately founded on a specific set of moral norms, but I think it's the complete opposite of a "with us or against us philosophy." I don't *like* communism, for example, but I don't have any issues with people living *voluntarily* in a communist society.


The NAP is the foundation of libertarianism. Anarcho-capitalism is essentially the consistent application of the NAP to every facet of human interaction. Obviously you don't agree with it, but calling it inconsistent seems disingenuous at best.


This statement seems especially bizarre with regard to libertarians. Could you elaborate?

Even minimum wage workers pay taxes.
