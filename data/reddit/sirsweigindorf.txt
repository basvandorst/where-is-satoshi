If the bitcoin is sent there is no way to get it back.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:44:59
Let the node sync, I'm pretty sure that is nesecarry to see if there are any funds in it.

I personally keep my bitcoin on a paper wallet for cold storage, as long as you don't expose your private keys it is perfectly secure. Make sure you have no malware on your computer when generating one.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:46:58
Put the wallet.dat in the bitcoin core data folder replacing whatever wallet.dat is currently there. (Yes, you will have to download bitcoin core and the entire blockchain)

When the price jumped from $3 to $7 everybody was asking the same question. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:56:29
According to the sidebar there are 10 btc in the bitcoin community fund.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:09:52
Why do you think this?

@_date: 2017-12-04 16:15:48
If they don't send you the bitcoin issue a chargeback with the credit card company.

Yeah go for it, I invested $80 around a year ago and just checked today. I now have $220. I wish I bought a lot more than I did.
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:39:22
Are we speaking in dollar value or effectiveness as a currency?
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:54:36
Bitcoin is a currency that exists nowhere but on the internet and is completely decentralized. This means that no one person or entity controls its, instead bitcoin is controlled by the people that use it. It is also anonymous. There are no names, only long and random wallet addresses. For example you create a bitcoin wallet. Instead of sending .01 bitcoin to BlueJ22, I would send it to the wallet address 1DN22TMR246R3EVxeCFMPiiCbNUY5XE6VT (actual length of address) There are only 21 million bitcoins that can be mined. This is to insure bitcoin can not be inflated. Mining is the process of using computational power to process the transactions on the bitcoin network. In return you receive bitcoin. For example, you want to send .058 btc (roughly $65) to Alice. You open up your bitcoin wallet and put in Alice's bitcoin address. Your wallet is what you use to hold and spend your bitcoins. Wallets can come in many different forms and I suggest looking on [bitcoin.org]( for more information on wallets. When sending the .058 bitcoin you pay a small fee to the miners and your transaction is put into a pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed by miners. All bitcoin transactions are kept on a public ledger called the block chain. When someone is mining bitcoin their computer is telling everyone that the .058 bitcoin you had is now owned by Alice. I hope this helps, let me know if you have any further questions; there was a lot that I did not cover.

@_date: 2017-02-25 17:22:26
Meh, besides from a price drop nothing would really happen. Banning Bitcoin would be like putting a gate across a sidewalk, but no fence on the side. It would be impossible to "ban" Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:30:04
Why would more adoption cause a price decrease?
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:18:07
Just don't invest anything you aren't able to use. Personally if I were you I wouldn't invest any more than buying one bitcoin since bitcoin is still in an early stage and could crash at any point. As for the bubble popping I wouldn't worry about that to much. Because of the volatility there will be many ups and downs.   
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:52:47
What fee did you set?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:23:49
I don't know... It's going pretty fast. Either way I'm buying up tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:39:09
Check out the website wallofcoins.com To purchase bitcoin you make a deposit to a specific bank account at a physical bank location. Don't buy drugs.

This is such a pain in the ass to dump, I currently have all my bcash sent to shapeshift, but it will take another hour because of the long time between blocks. I'm going to go take a nap.

@_date: 2016-12-23 22:10:18
My wallet consists of 18 transactions of just under a dollar worth of bitcoin each, would this increase the fee by that degree?

And I thought my .08 btc loss from poor altcoin investing was bad...
@_date: 2016-11-02 05:07:29
Bitcoin do not have to be bought as whole integers, you can buy parts of a Bitcoin. For example you can get .01 Bitcoin for under $8
@_date: 2016-11-03 04:19:33
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:59:35
So would my $5 transaction really consist of 18 inputs if those inputs are of a dollar each?
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:30:37
So would using a different wallet render a lesser fee?
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:40:10
Well, it looks like this didn't happen.

Guy on Reddit said it would happen so it will
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:23:17
If you have free hard drive space run it on your pc, raspberry pic is very slow to sync and I had troubles with it when I tried it. Your ledger wallet would be completely separate from your desktop node. It would still be very helpful as running a node adds another level of decentralization as you are holding a full copy of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:25:36
It is safe, you can view the code for yourself on github.

You would have to import the private key into a bitcoin diamond wallet. Imo bitcoin diamond is a scam as there is no wallet availible to do this with on their website.

At the current price of bitcoin $1,500 is roughly .27 btc. However the price of bitcoin fluctuates a lot so you would have to reach a price in bitcoin that you and the client agree upon.

Since this was a very low fee it may take another day for the transaction to go through. As a side note, bitcoin transactions are never "lost" if a transaction remains unconfirmed for a long period (think it is 3 days) this bitcoin will be returned to the sender's wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:34:43
No problem

If you want to receive your coins on the other chains you will want to move your coins to a wallet where you control the private keys. A simple way to do this is making a paper wallet at  There is nothing wrong with the blockchain wallet and it is what I personally use myself, however, you will not receive your coins on both chains.

I honestly don't get it. I called it that long before it became some sort of a meme. "Bitcoin cash" is just long.

 Slightly different over here, still a lot of unknowns though.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:33:22
If you click on the account button in the top right below your name you will see a toggle that says "Use BNB to pay for fees". If the toggle is selected and if you have enough BNB to cover the .05% fee it will automatically be withdrawn from your BNB balance.

@_date: 2017-07-23 04:06:37
This is true, but all the mining is still unnecessary as the answer is artificially made harder based on how many computers are mining. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:05:59
Download NiceHash and it will automatically mine the most profitable alt coin and pay you in bitcoin.

Or wallofcoins.com
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:31:44
I'm not saying that it will never happen, but it will be extremely hard to implement for the reasons you stated earlier. First of all it is extremely volatile, it would be very confusing if one day a mBTC could buy them a loaf of bread and then the next day only buy them 3/4 of a loaf. In order to eliminate volatility all of the coins would have to be mined and bitcoin would have to greatly overtake all fiat so you could not place a specific dollar value on it. Also fiat is going nowhere, as long as there are established governments fiat will exist.
Edit:Spelling/Grammar
