yes, i agree. though i'm not certain i'd attribute rulership of the USA to the civilian political class. when i think of authority in government, i perceive in terms of many various metrics of power. the Pentagon is very much a scientific institution. the biomedical complex is very much a scientific paradigm. world industrial capitalism is very much built upon pure science of hard physics and trade economics.
and i suggest that, according to my reading of the most advanced findings in the human sciences, all of this hard science power is misdirected and misappropriated.

as an occultist with their entire savings in bitcoin, i applaud and thank you for your ritual transaction.

why would it slowly deflate? as it slowly grows in legitimate markets, real infrastructure grows in its place to prevent decline.
*edit: real infrastructure as well as a real cryptoculture based on financial trust and independence. i don't foresee that declining either.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:03:30
it necessarily does.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:57:06
perhaps. i presently witness a world in which governments seek to exercise tighter and tighter economic control over the individual person. due to its very crypto nature and its wide recognition, bitcoin may always have utility as an internationally recognized underground currency from before The Great Crackdown.
edit: in the case of my doomsday scenario, i suspect that bitcoin would freeze its value at the rate it was deemed practically anathema. in happier cases (and i hope realistically), i see it leveling out like gold. it is a fixed resource, after all.

legitimacy in international markets where technocracy is the emergent form of government. get ready for greatness.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:52:54
yes, and i think that a technocracy must also include the knowledge of the human sciences, especially cultural anthropology. my major criticism of modern civilization is their ignorance of indigenous humanity, and that ignorance often results in disembodied political perspectives, giving birth to governments that are cruel to human beings. the united states provides one such example of a modern government that has moved towards hard science technocracy in ignorance of human science technocracy. the result is the military-prison-industrial complex. but i digress.
yes, a holistic technocracy sounds wonderful. korea and japan are so small and monoculturistic compared to europe and the states. generally speaking, western civilization has always been very much a cultural melting pot, and so we have a lot more difficulty and responsibility with organizing around any emergent system without cannibalizing. though the internet quite transcends tribalism, so we'll see!

what the... you're worse than my thesis advisor! ;) i'll take credit for my confusing language, but i meant only to reference a single context and a single idea:
bitcoin initially matured through its use as an underground currency on the dark web.
that's what i think, and that's how i've always used it, so my opinion is informed by my personal experience with it. still having a great time too, but i also agree with your caution.
don't worry about goalposts. i'm here to exchange ideas, not debate, which is why i don't really present my ideas as authoritative ("my understanding is..." / "i am beginning to question...").

thank you. i didn't realize exchanges were doing altcoin to legal currency conversions. that totally changes the whole game as far as i understood things.

what does cryptocurrency have to do with coffee?
i'm beginning to question whether or not microtransactions were ever an authentic part of bitcoin's essence. my understanding is that bitcoin anonymizes and streamlines high risk assets for vip transactions. illegal shit and big money. $1000 to move a million bucks is nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:12:54
those other altcoins which are more built for anonymity... are they dependent on the bitcoin market and conversion services to convert back into government currency? i'm definitely no expert when it comes to the tech stuff, but this is my present understanding: altcoins need bitcoin or they are otherwise worthless.
if i'm not totally mistaken (and please tell me if i am), wouldn't this class the altcoin phenomenon as bitcoin masquerading in various guises?

a waste of time eh? what does that make your reply to such a comment? and this reply?

i don't know what you're buying, but my town has a pretty awesome cash-only farmer's market. no snitching going on there either.

i am speaking in the context of industries operating illegally. are you familiar with the ins-and-outs of moving illicit funds? it is not easy or cheap.

the miners wouldn't have vested interested in any particular coin when they are invested across the cryptocurrency spectrum and are using bitcoin as a form of insurance. the weight of the vested interest theory is also lessened when considering that mining operations can be funded by the super-wealthy class (or even national governments).
is it not true that a lot of modern mining hardware is compatible across various coins? can supercomputers be directed to mine?
the evidence is enormous or nonexistent depending on how you choose to see it. ex: can we demonstrate concrete proof of a military police state, even when we know that all modern militaries function according to laws of conspiracy? war and business are not very different. the only concrete evidence we have is the hostility of altcoiners towards bitcoin, and the weight of the propaganda pushed to stall bitcoin's self-adaptation.
