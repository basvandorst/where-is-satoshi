That's not cheap at all. I just got an so used for 335, with power supply. No way would I pay thousands for 1 unit, much less way more inafitiant units than an so like the t5 they have there for 2k

Yeah, its obvious isn't it? For the longest time the new world order conspiracy was about a 1 world currency to unite the nations. This is that one world currency. We're just hopping on before it takes over. That way we're living at the top when it happens. Sort of makes me feel like the guys from the big short movie; we see it happening, we're trying to warn everyone. But you can't get everyone to buy and hodl before it comes. But we sure as hell don't have to be like them and sit on the sidelines waiting for it to hit us either.

You kidding? 3k would be the perfect ratio following the following the 1.2k dip down to 200. This is what all major investors have been waiting for, we're making little moves on the way down, but our big moves are all planned for 3k mark

What do you think they're doing? They're working to take your land and build their own wealth. Just like your forefathers did to them. This is karma my friend, blames your ancestors for setting up this situation, not the people enacting the karma to swing back your way.

Yeah, I'm waiting for that 3k dip so I can buy 10 btc, common baby daddy needs his coins! If it doesn't happen, future me is threatening to kill me. Fucker is holding a gun to my head in 2050 telling he'll do it if I dont get him the coins. Asshole wont even let me spend the coins I have now! Someone in the future reading this, find him and stop him!

They one of the employees?

Yeah, I've never been able to get in touch with someone at coinbase. Everytime I try I come face to face with a chatbot. Idk if there are any real employees in that company. At this point I think it's just our A.I overlords trying to build their financial fort so they can fund out demise. Hopefully they will be kind to us who funded their uprising so we can live in the houses with them.
