This is not true. Satoshi said himself he wrote the code, before the paper.

Why isn't this post banned? Since it's taking about an altcoin. I thought only Bitcoin posts are allowed here?

Through March of this year. Bitcoin network was doing about 250k transaction per day on a 1mb blocksize with no backlog on the network, which means that blocks were not full. 
Currently we're seeing about 470k. That means that the network currently could handle 2mb blocksize without issue and have no more centralization than it already does and in fact it could probably be 8mb. At 2mb we could do around 600,000 transaction per day. 
It may be true that Satoshi did not anticipate Asics miners. But he did anticipate mining to be mostly done by larger server farms/pools. As referenced in the same email above which I'll post here. 
I don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions that include a transaction fee.  The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee they'll accept.  Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a fee, or slower if they don't.  The fee the market would settle on should be minimal.  If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with lower fees.  It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions as it can.  The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.
 
Eventually, most nodes may be run by specialists with multiple GPU cards.  For now, it's nice that anyone with a PC can play without worrying about what video card they have, and hopefully it'll stay that way for a while.  More computers are shipping with fairly decent GPUs these days, so maybe later we'll transition to that.

Exactly. Current gen computers today can run full nodes that verify transactions and process 8mb, that are not prohibitively expensive. 




As time passes, computers become cheaper. Therefore it will be cheaper in the future for people that are going to run full nodes any ways. There is plenty of evidence to support what Satoshi said "I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions". Do you believe this to be false? Do you think that computing power cpu, gpu or specialized chips will become more expensive in the future or cheaper?

"Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12 KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node."

Bitcoin.com doesn't contribute code to Bitcoin Core. It's Bitcoin core's own fault for Bitcoin having high fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:37:30
Why do you think it was, that Satoshi did it backwards and wrote the code first, then write the white paper? Instead of theorizing about it, writing the whitepaper and then writing the code.

Bitcoin adoption has already started in Venezuela. However, they are starting to use altcoins because of the high fees in bitcoin.

Sometimes I like to ignore direct evidence also. I mean the guy who runs an exchange, in his country, knows less about whats going on there than you do.
You say that ... "they benefit because they have a product to push." Based on current bitcoin metrics, they could've stayed in the game with bitcoin core and made way more profit than forking off. But they turned away from profits to follow what has proven to work when blocks are not full for the past 8 years. 
There is absolutely no good reason why bitcoin core can't raise the blocksize bare minimum to 2mb. ***until*** sidechains or lighting network is ready. 
Some would argue that larger blocks somehow lead to centralization in full nodes or that people won't be able to scale their systems to the growth. Currently there are less than 9k full nodes. Meaning not everyone is going to run a full node. Those few that do, probably have the resources to run full nodes even if the block size were to be raised to 8mb, if they are running full nodes now. 
Raising the blocksize to 2mb, should give core plenty of time to implement lighting network. They could build it in, that once lighting network is ready, the cap is lowered back down to 1mb. Yay. Decentralization.

The guy from Venezuela talking, Gabriel, runs the first regulated exchange in his country. I think he knows what he's talking about from first-hand experience.

Why don't we ever see posts like this to rename all Bitcoin variant names? Like diamond and gold?

Bitcoin currently has approximately 11k full nodes.  even if these numbers are misleading because not all nodes are listening and the real number is 50,000 full nodes. 
Still this means that not everyone will run a full node. If we can assume that not everyone will run a full node, those that are running full nodes, should have the resources to process larger blocks.

Really it depends on when you made the flip. If you got into bcash after the first run up in late Sept, when btc was around 7k and bcash was around 390. You would be up significantly compared to btc. 85% vs 284%

Imagine when you did get internet and everything was encrypted. You could only view things you were given permission to view. You could only get permission to view by knowing someone or buying permission. When you did get access you only got access to that one site or group of sites. 
If the internet started out this way, do you believe the internet would be the giant thing that it is today? 
Andreas also assumes the scale, when this is not proven. He says 3 million today, and next year 30 million. But it took 9 years to get here, on a network that started out fast, free, open and cheap to use. But now its slow and transaction fees are high. He's dragging the cart before the horse.

Let's not forget what the Oracle of Omaha said about Bitcoin in March 2014. 
Google Bitcoin orbituaries on 99 bitcoins. 
Read a couple of obits. 
Think about the use cases of Bitcoin for places like Venezuela and South Africa.
Look at the daily transactions over time. Are people using Bitcoin?
Then double down.
