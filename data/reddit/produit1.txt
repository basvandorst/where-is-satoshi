There wasn’t really much room for misunderstanding what i was trying to say. 
But thanks for clearing that up, now you only have a few thousand more posts to go through and comment on.

Have been buying large chunks of btc everytime the price goes sub £8k. Not nessesaraly because i can comfortably afford it but because i have faith in the long term pay off. I see many of my friends in the same boat. Now is the time to buy IMO

Buy, buy, buy!

Conbase purchasing is down. Cant buy btc
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:19:45
Coinbase is charging at least £50 above the actual price for a buy right now. Such a con.

Of course China is cracking down on anything they cannot control centrally. Many governments are watching enviously as China looks to establish central control over blockchain technology for monetary purposes. Bitcoin is the de-centralised future we need, without the need for a central bank to manipulate value and enrich the privileged few. Buy the dip, forget about institutions buying bitcoin, its a store of value for the people.

Been buying £30 per day on the way down, admittedly I have been chipping away from my savings for this. I intend to put that money back in to my savings on pay day, I can't pass up the opportunity to buy in this sale.
I have been careful to only buy at a rate that I won't regret in the short term. I am not looking for short term profits.
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:20:56
Yep, it's all nonsense and marketing BS. I use  [  in general to track the price of things I actually want to buy throughout the year, folks here might find it useful for Black Friday. Enjoy.

Bored of this £8k flatline. When moon?

Go to the trade screen and after you have put in the amount you would like to purchase it displays a completely different figure in the trade preview screen, same when selling
@_date: 2019-10-16 10:31:07
I would have suggested coinbase pro, but the fees have also gone up there as of last week. Others in this group will be more knowledgable than me.
@_date: 2019-10-16 09:43:01
Yep. It instantly adds £50 to the cost when buying and subtracts £50 when selling as well. Plus they make money from the fee. 
If you are thinking of day trading or short term gains, forget it. You will always be at least £100 out of pocket.

Just imagine if a bank closed its doors in your country and held your money until you stopped protesting against a corrupt system. The case for decentralised money should be stronger than ever -

Well, in London you can simply buy expensive property to launder your cash. Criminals have been doing it for decades. The rotten system here welcomes it, no questions asked.

Mainly Knightsbridge, borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea etc. 
Most foreign despots and shunned, fraudulent billionaires are at it.
@_date: 2019-12-23 18:09:55
Nope. 1 day of rising followed by 7 days of dips. Then the same again in Jan, Feb, March ........
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:50:01
Does the source and forum matter if the information ultimately proves to be and has been correct? I don't get your point.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:51:43
Haha, and there we have it. The manipulation out here in plain sight. Tim Draper and Tom Lee will scuttle back in to a hole until the next minor breakout when they start spouting their wild prices to encourage more noobs to buy in, right before whale bots sell off again and the cycle of the last 6 months continues.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:51:53
Don't worry, will drop back down like a stone once whales are positioned where they can make a healthy profit from dumping again.
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:29:32
£100 sharp drops almost daily. These are most definitely whale dumps.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:37:33
Agreed, i’m in it for the long term and benefits to sovereign ownership of wealth. You still can’t help getting a bit disheartened by all these sell offs in short succession.

And lets not forget his boss, won’t release his own taxes for fear of being found out to be the ultimate tax avoider.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m in BTC for the long game. I don’t even keep my main bank account in a traditional bank, i use Tally gold to hold my funds, backed by gold and much more robust than fake fiat money printing. 
Now, how to manipulate BTC in its current stage of development is not too difficult if you are a whale in cooperation with other whales that are holding a substantial amount. E.g sell to reduce the overall price and then buy it all back at a relative discount shortly after. Over time i hope this will diminish but for now we are unfortunately stuck in this pattern.
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:41:52
Not the bottom. 
Another £100 drop due today/ tomorrow. I remember reading that someone said Bitcoin is now stuck in a pump and dump pattern for the foreseeable future. It will go up over time, but the charts will look depressing if you are only looking at short term changes. Not sure I can argue against that.

You seem to be having a bad day. 
I'm not claiming to be a reporter or a journalist so I have no need to post my sources. I am not seeking credibility - This is a discussion group about bitcoin.
People come here to share thoughts, theories and in some instances interesting sources of information. If you disagree with that I suggest you post some house rules about how to write a post on a bitcoin discussion thread on Reddit.
Have a nice day.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:37:45
For sure, i just wanted to put the news out there to inform people. Its time to buy the dip!
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:22:58
Price is at £6991, so off course Coinbase will sell to you for £7028 + £4 transaction fee!
