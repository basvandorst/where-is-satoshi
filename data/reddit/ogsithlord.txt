Not everybody cares enough about privacy to change they way they do things. If you asked people if they care about privacy the majority would say they do, but wouldn'tgo out of their way by not using a convenient service or avoiding a particular app or internet site.
Zuckerberg has a big enough ego to make sure this succeeds. Which will be good for bitcoin and shitcoins overall, and digital assets will become normalised.

Its already 10k in Australian dollars

Lawyer here. I'm long on BITCOIN.

PEOPLE POWER
@_date: 2018-09-29 22:13:45
That is a shame. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 10:51:37
Thanks for linking such an interesting looking article! 
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:46:46
Exactly. Don't get swept along by the HODL hype. Buy low and sell high. 
@_date: 2019-11-18 10:39:20
Even if McAfee's prediction is only half true, I don't think we should complain.
@_date: 2019-11-14 09:28:33
I'm 33 years old and earn 100k a year. I wish I'd discovered bitcoin earlier and done what you are doing. I think you are making a good decision, and it actually sounds well reasoned and thought out. All the best.

Not a bad debate, was interesting to watch. It seemed like the confidence in the bitcoin blockchain wasn't really raised as a counter point to the statis system behind government backed fiat and the confidence that entails. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:58:21
Exactly. I like the dollar symbol incorporation- most people associate that symbol with money, and we are creating a new system for people that needs to be as easy as possible to adopt. Like grafting christianity ontop of paganism- there will be elements that should be incorporated to make it easier to be accepted by the masses. 
Also the @ symbol only reached prominence with the mainstream use of email and the internet- so most people associate that with the internet/the digital age. 
A genius design. You will go down in history. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:08:55
Exactly. Yet this keeps getting reported as news. Crypto news is the worst 
@_date: 2019-03-15 02:50:51
Do it USA. It will promote crypto adoption. 
@_date: 2019-10-02 23:05:25
Amazing. And I thought holding since December 2017 required balls...
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:22:49
They're not decimated. Big daddy bitcoin will drag them along kicking and screaming.
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:00:28
It is a good time to buy before the bull run REALLY takes off
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:40:56
Bob is a G
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:07:37
Btc is money. It is there to be used. People should buy it and sell it as they wish.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:27:30
You probably wont get btc at 12k for another year after it makes a newATH and then bears.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:01:16
McAfee may be right still though, we all know how quickly bitcoin can move. There is still time.
@_date: 2019-02-24 21:12:02
Lol don't blink or you will miss the bull run
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:44:48
We dont need libra, just accept bitcoin, monero, ethereum, etc
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:24:43
They want our bitcoins, but they're not getting them until they're prepared to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for them. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:33:29
When it is not $19000 anymore.

This is one of the best crypto newsletter articles I've read in long time. This is the type of journalism in this space we need. Kudos. Subscribed.
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:36:37
We probably have another 6 months at least of bear market before a gradual very slow bull start to build. The bottom will probably be reached within the next 6 months. I would not be surprised if we get to low 3000s usd, maybe even close to the high 2000s. 
@_date: 2019-12-22 16:24:54
Wow. Interesting, that in itself.
@_date: 2019-12-01 05:45:30
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:59:49
Bitcoin just does what it does and is what it is.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:38:45
Hmmm. The way the charts are heading I think instead we will see downwards and sideways action moving around 3 to 6k for at least around 6 months after the halvening then we will see the upward momentum building for several more months until culminating into a parabolic run to an ATH. I think it is pointless to expect a serious bull run until at least 12 months after the next halvening.
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:35:55
@_date: 2019-04-16 21:38:48
Well it is already over 7k in Australian dollars.
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:59:44
This was actually pretty good. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 01:59:19
Thank-you for posting this. I sometimes need reminding that these dips are normal behaviour for bitcoin and crypto in general. 
@_date: 2019-09-20 07:37:16
Absolutely. Always expect the price to dump straight after you buy. But if you are in it for the long haul then after 2-3 years you will understand the wisdom of your ways.
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:32:57
No we want to get rich quick.
@_date: 2019-09-09 07:24:28
That is insanely cool! Imagine also being able to receive fiat by sending btc to the atm...
@_date: 2019-09-20 08:11:43
Dude, are serious? After reading the article that is your takeaway? Totally triggered. 
Read the article, people. It is a good read.
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:59:56
It will recover. This is just what bitcoin does. It is normal for this asset. Tell yourself you are not selling and hold onto it. After several years, you will understand and see that overall the value of the asset grows.
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:18:12
That's awesome.
@_date: 2019-02-16 13:16:48
Bank fail.

Now 100x. I dare ye.
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:19:32
But what about after....5 years??????��
