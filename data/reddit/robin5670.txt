What do you mean by a hardware wallet? And what functionality would it have? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:35:32
Shiiiiit. Hope you can afford to lose some of that if you decide to panic sell.

IT'S TOO COMPLICATED!
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:31:20
It really doesn't matter what method you use to purchase it, as long as someone gets bitcoin for a product it stimulates the economy and encourages more people to use bitcoin, opening up new ways for people to purchase directly using bitcoin.
Keep on bitcoining :D

It's even obvious from the name, lol. That's like asking the blockchain for your money back. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:21:05
Also how would fees be determined? The price can change at any time and the network has very little to no way to detect that without relying on 3rd party websites. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:34:54
It's already above 600, soooo. Probably.

I doubt the average schmoe gives a shit about sha-256...
It's also probably too complicated for them to understand even if you stripped it to the core program.

Edit: whoops, someone already explained. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 03:02:44
it's time. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:54:21
...yes :(
But you know it's because they can't tax it.
EDIT: aw shit, that comeback!! he asked her if there were any proven organizations that used it, and she had to say no :D
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:34:46
Aw come on, he was basically just begging for money there.

Send explosive movies to everyone!

Except with complaining about other forms of currency. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:17:38
Well I think it's a good idea to be skeptical of anything like bitcoin and not go all-in at once. Slower adoption of things like bitcoin is a good thing, even bits and pieces of your spare money can add up to a big return. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:17:39
Ewww. LTC.

Yay shitty web devs! High five!

7. Complex enough to be used by terrorists.

CoinJar said they had to jump through a lot of hoops to get their app going. I want a coinbase iOS app as much as anyone else but it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:32:11
So many gumballs!
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:24:24
Ha.

Right back down. 
It's a bubble. Bubbles pop.

Is there already a bitcoin eBay site? I doubt it'd work well but I'd like to see one.

Hey, spending bitcoin and keeping its economy active is worth more than just that curry. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:12:36

You need more than one usually.
