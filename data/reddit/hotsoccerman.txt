Do you think it is in his best interest to continue to not care?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:48:01
Cool thanks for explaining. You already know this, but, the fact that you do not care about his opinion doesn't change the fact that many people do care about his opinion. Clearly, you think people should not care about his opinion, and I agree. Problem is, people do care about his opinion, and that opinion has an effect on the demand for and price of Bitcoin. Do you care about the demand for and price of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:32:36
You sound very confident that Tether is being "printed." 
Knowing this, are you shorting Bitcoin? If not, why not?
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:19:35
Just don't forget about us when it's time to start shorting, would appreciate a heads up.

How does the article take what he said out of context? FT literally contextualizes his previous statement, provides a link to it, and quotes him verbatim. It is up to you as the reader to determine the "why."
	
"Jamie Dimon says he “regrets” his now infamous criticism of bitcoin, in which he called the cryptocurrency a “fraud”.
The JPMorgan Chase chief executive on Tuesday softened the comments he made at a banking conference in September, saying in an interview on FOX Business Network, a US television station, that “I regret making them”."
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:10:53
This is good stuff, thank you for writing. 
What about BTC specifically makes you think that there will be an increased demand for access to tokens? When you say Tokens, do you mean the smallest denomination, Satoshis? What is the value for a business to own these tokens? What does owning, for example, 1,000 Satoshis, allow a company to do other than to send the value of 1,000 Satoshis? What are some specific use cases? (Like, each satoshi be able to be “used” in a transaction to permanently encode data on the blockchain. That allows companies to do X which is valuable and less expensive than doing Y) I understand that a lot of this is like trying to predict Uber in 1995, but would love to hear ideas.

Are we talking about Tether or new Bitcoins? I was asking how much Tether was being converted daily after you said $100M a day was being "printed."
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:35:18
Thanks for the response. You say during a recession there is generally a flight to stores of value. Do you have any data to back this up? 
I agree that bitcoin is a digital store of value, but I wonder how many people would sell. Additionally, I wonder how many people would buy...
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:27:05
He didn't admit he was wrong. He said he regrets saying it. I can regret saying things and still believe them. Knowwhatmimsayin?
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:56:51
This makes sense. However, I don’t think it’s as simple as saying tether represents $1B of a $250B market. Removing a percentage of $1B from the market quickly could have a disproportionately large downward  and compounding effect. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:41:28
I really want to believe this, and I do to a certain extent. Can you expand more on how holding the deed to future transaction recording space will be valuable? In other words, what is it about "owning" BTC that will be valuable in this application? Are you able to quantify this potential value at all? (I know I'm a asking some very forward looking questions so thanks)
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:21:16
This is correct. I can call Jamie a dick, and then say that I regret calling him a dick. This doesn't change the fact that I still think he is a dick, I just regret saying it out loud. 
WHY does he regret it? That is the question I would like the answer to.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:41:43
Having worked for a member of congress, I can assure you that lawmakers' staff (who do all the actual work) know EXACTLY what his position is. Additionally, I can assure you that Chase spends many millions of dollars a year through lobbyists to ensure that they do. And not just that they know his position, but that they pass laws accordingly. I'm sure you know, but this is not a conspiracy, this is literally how it works.
We can't do much about lobbying on K street. But at least we can call him out on his BS. Joe Q Public cares about what Jamie says, and that's not going to change. If we stand any chance to educate the general public about Bitcoin as a general concept, then we must respond to his one loud voice with many soft voices. In a perfect world, everyone does their own research and no one cares about Jamie. This aint' Eden, bud. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:14:41
Right, but that’s in fiat currency.  What we are talking about here is transferring value without using fiat currency.

How do you know?
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:18:28
I don't know. You say $100M USD daily like it happens every day and has been happening every day. What is the average number over the last thirty days? Is it $100M USD per day?
If you know Tether is a scam, then shorting bitcoin isn't really gambling is it? Sounds like a pretty sure thing, just surprising that you wouldn't take advantage of your knowledge, but you don't have to invest in order to have an opinion! Thanks for contributing to the dialogue.

@_date: 2018-01-09 20:07:26
Do you think that Dimon calling bitcoin a fraud could also have negative effects not having to do with price? Like affecting how lawmakers approach legislation, or how policy is created?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:32:36
Characterizing bitcoin in general as a "fraud" is objectively incorrect. Saying there are instances of fraud is fine, but that is clearly not what he meant.
Fraud: Wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain
Either he didn't do enough research and took a very strong, public opinion, which is foolish. Or he did do research, and he's trying to fool his audience. Either way, there is foolishness or foolin' afoot.

I understand your logic here, but... According to the dictionary, the definition of own is to have something as one’s own, OR to possess. Are you saying animals can’t possess things? What would stop a machine from possessing something? Aren’t humans just super complex machines? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:11:30
I’ll play along. When in the coming days will it drop more? Two days, ten days? How much will it drop? How quickly will it drop? Will it recover? How quickly will it recover? How high will it recover to? Most importantly, what are you basing your prediction on?

"Remember, these predictions are somewhat tongue-in-cheek — the bank deliberately concocts unlikely scenarios."
The tongue-in-cheek figure of speech is used to imply that a statement or other production is humorously or otherwise not seriously intended, and it should not be taken at face value
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:59:21
Did you buy during one of the $120 bull traps? (There were a couple) What do you mean we are in hype? What do you mean foolish mistakes? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:35:50
So when you bought at $120, the price just kept going up from there? No dips? Sounds like you got lucky, which is awesome. Have you held since then? If you sold, when did you sell and why? According to you, we are in “hype.” What is that and why do you believe that? How long will it last? Can you defend your statement by quantifying anything? It’s entirely possible that we’re in a period of irrational exuberance and I’d like to hear concrete numbers, timelines, etc from people who believe that. Also, if you believe something is overvalued, then surely you must know what the actual value is otherwise how would you know it’s overvalued? 
I agree that investing more than you are willing to lose is foolish. I also think that waiting for the dip to $2k is foolish, but no one really knows.

You a glass-half-full kinda dude, u/BluntLord 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:21:18
I’ve been lurking here for a while and seen some serious FUD. I feel compelled to respond. I only have a few minutes to write, so I’ll address a few issues.
Dude I’m sorry but your article is full of straw man arguments and anecdotal evidence. It’s almost as if you tried to find the most inefficient way to use bitcoin in an attempt to pursuance others of a presupposed opinion. But I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you didn’t know better. I’ve had to help my grandmother with bitcoin in much the same manner, so consider this a learning experience.
1) There is no requirement that you put a hardware wallet in a bank. This is an option that exists today. You also didn’t differentiate between “trusting a bank” in terms of controlling and distributing your government controlled currency and “trusting a bank” as a place where you can store valuable objects in a safety deposit box. Big difference that was conveniently omitted, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt there too.
2) Coinbase is convenient and you pay extra for that convenience.  It also can link to your bank account. Why are you surprised that Coinbase verifies your identity? There is no requirement that bitcoin be purchased, stored or traded on Coinbase or on any exchange. One can purchase bitcoin from ATMs, localbitcoins, and through many others. But I’ll assume you didn’t know that either. 
3) In order to send bitcoin to someone in India, you need their public key, that’s it. If you or they decide to convert it into fiat, that is your decision. 
4) Oh god there’s so much more, you set your fees, you control your private keys.... I could go on
TL;DR Bitcoin can be as inefficient, costly and public as YOU want it to be. That’s the whole point.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:55:27
Thanks for the response. I appreciate that you see some of the issues with your article. 
I want to ask you a question. Did you have an agenda before writing this article? Specifically to promote ETH? I mean you wrote in the article under the premise that this was “an experiment.” (I won’t go into the issues here re: scientific method, that’s a whole other can of worms.) You then proceed to draw sweeping conclusions about bitcoin in general and at the end tell your reader to buy ETH instead. There’s nothing wrong with promoting ETH, but before calling bitcoin “hype”, and advising “noobs” who don’t know any better, how about you try another experiment where you attempt to buy something more frugally, securely, anonymously, and see what the results are. You know, in the interest of science. 
Also, you really need to look up what a straw man argument is. In your response, you say “Bitcoin ATM are not anonymous” Did I say they were anonymous? So why are you arguing against a point I didn’t make? Either you are intentionally doing it, which is bad, or you are making assumptions, which is worse.
I’m being a little hard on you, but given your measured response I trust you’ll learn from this. I know I have.

They specifically mention Bitcoin, ETH and LTC as the existing public blockchains on which second layer solutions will be built. They then take a not so subtle jab at BCash in the next sentence. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:45:35
I agree that right now, Bitcoin is unworkable as a currency. To be fair though, Bitcoin's volatility pales in comparison to the historic volatility of many state-sponsored currencies. The difference is, Bitcoin is generally speaking volatile UP while state-sponsored currencies are generally speaking volatile DOWN. Andres puts it well when he says, "I don't need to convince people from Venezuela. I don't need to convince people from Zimbabwe." For those of us who are lucky enough to live somewhere with a stable currency where banking is easy, the benefits of Bitcoin are a bit harder to understand.

Thanks. Do we have data from prior halvings to support this? Also, to what extent does the minting of new coins affect the market supply? In other words, what percentage of newly minted coins get immediately sold or what percentage of the available supply on a given day is available because of recently minted coins? If we can measure this %, then could we potentially quantify what the potential impact of reducing the minted supply by 50% is to the marketplace?

If this is true, I have a theory on the "why." It goes like this:
Coinbase's lawyers told them that if they don't explicitly call out that BCash is not Bitcoin, then they could be accused of deliberately misleading their customers, or allowing it to be confusing enough to where a reasonable person could not tell the difference. This is a big no-no in the USA. How easy would it be to bring a lawsuit against coinbase saying that you bought BCash thinking it was Bitcoin? One could argue that Coinbase has a responsibility to accurately represent the products that can be purchased from their site. Not doing so could expose them to liability and lawsuits.
