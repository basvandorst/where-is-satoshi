Merry christmas! tagging you as bitcoin santa!
@_date: 2012-12-09 03:09:28
tbh, its probably the second most used site after silkroad. 
@_date: 2012-12-15 12:33:18
worth a try

I bought 20 btc, and never got them,....
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:34:33
more people getting intersted in bitcoin, more people buying them, more places accepting them as payment. thats pretty much why the growth has happened [along side speculation]
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:45:10
are you the person who bought the pizza now worth [$2,520,319.26](
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:18:19
Sounds interesting, I bet you could probably sell a small batch of those, How many would you plan on making?
You could drum up intrest by offering one in some sort of competition or reddit giveaway and then selling the rest? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:03:52
ha, thats too cruel!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:12:26
so i should get some litecoins ?

" If you say that eventually it’s going to rain, you’ll be right. It doesn’t make you a meteorologist" im going to use that analogy ! good article
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:22:04
I used bitbargain the other day and from registering on the site to getting my bitcoins took about 20 min.
I think its the best way currently for us in the uk via bank transfer. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:58:50
I made a few purchases with BTC back when the price was £7 per BTC I have a .3 btc left which im just kind of spectating the growth with. I dont have enough desposable income to buy BTC with really, but its still quite fun to watch how everything is changing. 
I also got scammed for around 20 btc when trying to buy btc so that kind of put me off for a while. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:31:32
I heard about them on reddit maybe 2 years ago, didnt really think much about it at the time, I became interested when I read the articles about silkroad. Then I looked deeper bought a couple btc, played some satoshi dice, got up to 20 btc, lost it all pretty much. just chilling now with my .3 btc as i forgot about btc before it started to really climb, I think i bought my btc at around £6 GBP and its pretty crazy to see them at £162 GBP Now!
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:00:30
And so a legend was born
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:36:24
ah yes, thats also a very good resource haha :P
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:41:03
ha, i read this wrong, I assumed that he was selling his house for money to buy coins ! 
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:10:53
How are you feeling now about your investment!?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:57:13
That was around the time I first heard about bitcoin i think, Wish i got in then ha
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:55:23
i like fads, I loved pokemon and yoyos at school, I probably will always like some kind of fad. 
Does it matter if it is a fad? 
@_date: 2013-01-10 16:39:51
sometimes i wish i had money !
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:34:31
you can stick to online wallets if you want 
I have a blockchain.info wallet. 
I have heard of a client called electrum that doesnt need the blockchain to download if that is a worry. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:33:50
Way to go!
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:13:51
Ah i Thought that was just via bank transfer, I havnt tried to buy latly, Does this apply to all methords. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:45:05
it doesnt look like the price will come down soon but who knows?! thats why its speculation. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:38:21
Some could be, but i think most just wanted to get btc off sr and to personal wallets until Sr is back to normal
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:49:00
ah, interesting site! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:35:17
I saw that tip and thought it must have been a joke at first! insane ha, people like that make me jealous but happy if that makes any sense. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:12:46
I would probably be a user/observer. I use bitcoin to buy things but its fun to watch how BTC are progressing. especially today ha
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:53:23
Was only a matter of time till some news site picked this up, not everyday you see something like that happen. He will probably have to make another reddit account tho to get away from everyone begging for tips which does suck. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:46:09
Im from the UK and im using [Bitbargin]( at the moment. I can just bank transfer to get btc which is pretty nice. 
Not sure what the Euro equivilent is
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:26:23
I dont have a clue, but it seems like it was a good move!
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:49:31
Thanks for confirmation, will get some litecoins. 
ps. how do i litecoin
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:14:20
If everything you said is true, no one knows for sure that bitcoin is going to keep increasing like this. While it might, is it really worth risking when you are already in a lot of debt, Just do you best to get out of debt. 
Dont gamble with your kids lives. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:48:01
hehe, well best of luck with your business in the US. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:03:10
Does that include stopping buying via sortof banking on blockchain.info ?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:29:14
Do you know what was the highest and when?
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:31:13
250 wall was down an hour ago i think
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:15:09
You cant go around tipping that amount and not expect people to try suck your dick over the internet. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:51:10
A nice vision! hope it works out for you, the site looks rather simple and like it would be easy to use.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:32:01
Oil painting and photography
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:59:28
Way to go! must be pretty awesome, as basiclly an observer im jealous!
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:53:08
What did I just read. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:10:28
Very smart move. Try save 1 bitcoin maybe if you can afford to and still pay off the debt, always fun to watch how the market is changing. 
Congratulations on being debt-free. stay that way :P
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:30:05
Operation whut
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:56:39
Thats a good policy! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:42:30
Im going to be blunt, my favorite part about bitcoins are the fact that you dont have to keep paying fees while trading, second favorite would be the near anonimity.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:05:35
I dont mind images, as long as they comment with decent info and something to discuss, like that "how i keep up on the price of btc" post in the image. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:01:52
I never really looked to invest in BTC so you should ignore my answer i guess. 
But if the price of BTC keeps rising [bar the current drop] it would be a good investment. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:54:10
until then ill stick with my 0.07415186 BTC. one day i will be rich! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:21:02
Very unlucky mate, I to got scammed out of around the same amount in btc so i understand how you feel, it does suck but its also a learning experiance and you will now be a lot safer in the future. The shock doesnt last too long. 
Thanks for your story and warning, my advice to you would be be very careful when you buy from btc sellers online. I never recieved my 20 btc when i payed a guy who was reputable but appartly decided to just cut and run. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:26:24
Biggest drop in btc history? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:06:50
definatly, you can buy everything cheaper elsewhere 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:43:01
If you have an incentive to say what you think, why wouldnt you ?
@_date: 2013-01-03 10:57:50
its fun too, well when you win!

I did go to art college ^^^might ^^^have ^^^dropped ^^^out
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:47:43
I think the only way i know that is possible for buying btc from SA would be via Blockchain.info, i know there is an option to make a phone deposit but i have not tried it to confirm it works. could be worth looking into ? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:46:32
wow, just 14 days ago that pizza was worth 750k now its closer to 2.5 million
@_date: 2013-05-01 08:26:41
its so interesting but could now be the end for esea, that is a massive betrayal of trust. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:26:23
well I still have about 0.3 btc which i have been watching, but i have not made another purchase of bitcoins, dont really have the disposable income at the moment. Still its very interesting to watch the whole bitcoin community grow and its reactions to the market prices changes etc. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:49:23
i did not see that ha. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:59:26
Yes, People like to panic sell now and again
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:04:28
your not wrong there. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:43:49
AFAIK 
1btc 
0.01 btc = 1 millibit [mbtc]
0.0001 = 1 microbit [ubtc]
please correct me if i am wrong. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:04:10
Who knows, it could keep climbing over 1000$usd per btc eventually. or it might go back down to 20$ 
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:30:25
 I guess.
Nsfw btw 
@_date: 2013-01-10 15:04:48
thats pretty awesome, I tryed something similar and lost 35 btc ha. win some you lose some. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:09:28
Check out  
I have used them before. They might be low on BTC tho

This happens to every subreddit that grows very fast. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:56:48
not the best way to look at it, but i know what you mean. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:32
I would say that they all do, but it is temporary, it takes a bit of time for the mods to adapt and bring in more moderators to help. Also the rules will change [stricter, tagged posts, maybe even a good faq for the sub]
it does take a bit of time but its just the way i see reddit working.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:40:06
Those look pretty awesome!
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:20:26
I opened this expecting it to be a list of your adresses, was plently supprised and a good idea. 
Check out threads at the [marketplace]( over at bitcointalk forums, might find some lesser know sites there. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:38:48
Awesome, you took a relativly big risk and its going to pay off.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:38:33
I just had my morning tea, but unfortunatly I am out of crumpets. 
Quick, too the shop before i return to watch the BTC graphs
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:54:48
well i guess im not wrong ha. I was just imagining him going homeless in an attempt to profit on bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:08:18
Way to go, glad to see you actually did as he requested, He will probably see this, I bet people were hounding him for free btc and he probably just made a new account, uphold the anonimity!
thats something i do sometimes with btc adresses. [stop using them and create new]
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:00:39
lol thats a nice bot!
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:28:29
ye, i lost 20 btc on satoshi dice. but hey, it was at the time my disposable income that i was playing with for fun, not winning. 
looking back does make me twitch a little tho ha
This was back when btc where sub 10$
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:42:07
Over the last month it has really exploded, I feel like i have missed the boat now. Still, who knows where the price for BTC could end up? Maybe a year from now my 0.3 btc will be worth £100's! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:22:08
ah good luck, I have used sofort banking to get bitcoin on blockchain before, from what i understood it was some EU banking thing that allowed me to transfer from my UK bank account to get bitcoins, there was a small fee tho. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:35:51
Ah, 2 of my favorite things, wine and btc. 
Do you ship to the uk :P

I know prices fluctuate, people were just scared, buy in at 250+ and the same day it drops to 150- a lot of people could have been easily scared. 
@_date: 2013-02-02 02:46:50
I think thats the biggest tip i have seen! awesome

@_date: 2013-04-09 20:50:12
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:51:27
I can understand where you come from, when BTC was about £7, I found it easy to bet on satoshi dice. But with the current price Its not an issue for me anymore. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:47:00
I feel your pain also being an observer, still its pretty fun to watch.
