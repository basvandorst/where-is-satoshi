The date is also important and shows us bitgo wallet was implemented before they start to be annoyed by the CFTC.

Just received this machine last Friday. I was talking with Karel the CEO since july. (A real picture of the machine :  )
The machine is really great, good manufacturing and working great as expected.
And the really important point, is that Karel, the CEO is a really awesome guy, very patient (I'm not an easy customers :)), very conscientious, highly professional. He always try to do things easier and faster for his customers. The support is excellent too, he was here when some misconfigurations happened. 
Really, if you wanted to buy an ATM you can go with eyes closed.

Yup, I had this idea too with the coin acceptor.
Worth a try, don't forget to plan to do it with lot of currencies ($ and € at least). 
And someting to stick it somewhere.
Try to accept both coin/cash, you'll be the only one to do that.
The only problem I see, is about the AML/KYC compliance. (skyhook have the same problem)

Stealing is stealing, that's not because it's not written that bitcoin stealing is illegal it is. Imagine a wordl when you must make a law for all of the existing goods. "Banana stealing is illegal, potatoe stealing is illegal..."
Use your logic.

Dear MtGox Customers,
In the event of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.
Best regards,
MtGox Team

Stop complaining, Bitcoin is a mean of payment, and this characteristics add value on it.
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:13:32
Here is a translation/summary of the interview:
It's said mark is one of the most hated person of internet. He's on the investigation of japanese and american authorities. His mother is not worried, she said "mark will do anything he must to do, he hid during 3 day to recuparate to face what's going to happen." and "If he was really worried, he would have called me".
The article speaks about how mark is a genius. He was good at school blablabla...
Internet believe he is incompetent or a thief. His mother is not worried "I'm sure he will succeed this time again" she said after saying that the last time she visited him, he resolve in a night an attack again mtgox. She said "And what is 480M $, compared to states and financers are playing with".
Mark is married with a japanese. His mother said "Internet world is tought, and when we know how bitcoin are hated by banks and states, we can understand my son disturbed them".
Sorry for my english if some expressions are not understoodable, I'll try to do better when I'll have more time.

I have two ideas about that
Idea 1 : shop simulator, where as a merchant you see all the advantages about accepting bitcoin.
Idea 2 : Be a bitcoiner, mine, install atm, arbitrage, trading etc... and try to be the first bitcoin owner (number of bitcoin = score)
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:56:23
Thks for the infos!

For the aml/KYC compliance : maybe try to add a numeric pad to identify customers with their mobile number.(like one of these  Server sending generated code you must enter to the machine to enable the transaction.

As a Frenchie, I just want to say that is really incredible in france. Bitcoin ARE NOT illegal at all. It's just a douchebag custom agent who want to meet his quota. I just laugh a lot when he mentionned the fiscal administration, this guy is a joke.
Français: Évite le dépôt de plainte, dans les faits le préjudice que tu as subis n'est que minime, ça te coûtera cher pour pas grand chose. Surtout que je ne pense pas que le fait que tu te sois fait contrôler, par excès de zèle soit condamnable pour l'administration. T'en fais pas pour le volet administration fiscale, ils sont tellement débordés qu'ils préfèrent contrôler les grosses boites que les petits particuliers en général.
En revanche tu devrais quand même voir un avocat pour ce fichage, voir quels en sont les conséquences, si vraiment pénible go tribunal administratif.
Ce que tu devrais faire en revanche c'est envoyer ton récit de toute l'histoire à des journalistes, là il y aurait une chance que ton récit leur mettent la honte qu'ils méritent.

of course but i think if he dropped all his BTC in once it's not to get back in the run again. But it's not impossible.

Don't take that for you, but you're really funny to protect your bitcoin jesus.

This post is complete BS. As a trader, If the futur is uncertain, I'll short it. XT adds uncertainty, so it is directly related.
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:14:50
Yeah, they seems to not understand it's not customer's problem to solve their problems.

Do you know what is ridiculous? To make a statements you don't have to. 
As far as I know, Ver didn't have a gun on his head while doing it. I highly doubt he didn't have any personnal interest doing it.
Yelling okcoin is gox, just because he got problem with them like a 5 year old spoiled kid, and trying to influence the reddit community didn't help neither to have a good reputation.
