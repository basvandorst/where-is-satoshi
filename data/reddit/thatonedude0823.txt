Give them time to realize. Luke did not understand the strength of the force as a padawan. These 8th graders will become cynical just like the rest of us all in due time.

Yeah I know there isn't, but it's hard to conceptualize this sort of inequality (which I believe will be more drastic than the inequality currently present). Also hard to conceptualize a state of inequality where I am suddenly at the top end of the spectrum.

This is the biggest concern I had for BTC. I see all the great benefits that come from BTC adoption, but wouldn't the inequality levels just make cryptocurrency more detrimental than helpful? Hope someone can enlighten me, because I need ammo when I am asked this question.

[opennode.co](  \- you should buy out the .com if you can

Bitpay handles only on-chain BTC transactions. OpenNode is lightning enabled... so unlike Bitpay, they have instant confirmations, no network fees for their user's customer's, and the ability to do microtransactions
