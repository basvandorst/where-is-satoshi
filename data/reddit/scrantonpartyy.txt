Well as it approaches the limit of Max coins, won't it be more and more difficult to mine the coins? How are the trade fees determined with the fluctuating supply of miners?

Agreed lol. Investing in crypto is basically gambling. I'd never put 100k of lotto tickets in a card. Obviously it's not quite the same bc you DO  still have money after exchanging but it's still a high risk gamble nonetheless

Question: if I make multiple backups of it (wallet on phone, wallet on USB drive, wallet on hdd of home pc) how do those all sync? When you access them does the wallet software sync with the " ledgers" in the blockchain?

Wow that sucks. Yeah I'd never keep them at the exchange. No matter what. That's kind of the whole idea imo is being your own bank. But then again I'd never put that much money into it. I'm thinking MAYBE $200 spread across etherum Bitcoin and Monero.

Aw fuck there are trade fees? I guess it makes sense. They need to pay for their system resources.

I am new to all this (don't own any coins yet). I was under the impression that the coins are stored in your wallet. Are you saying they are stored at the exchanges like a bank?

I will start with $200. I will have my student loans paid off this fall so I will then have more money to safely play with. I'm hoping by then, I can look at the handful of cryptos I invested in and see which I should continue investing in. 
I'd much rather invest in mutual funds or something, but right now with the economy booming, it's not really the best time to buy into it. 
My concern, is that with the next economic crash, people will have to unload their crypto for a more liquidable USD and thus drop the value of those coins on the market....point being idk if now is the time to buy into crypto either since the economy is booming.

I thought another large advantage of Bitcoin was that the transactions were free? Would transaction fees go away after we've hit that critical-point where miners abandon mining? 
It seems everything I have read is wrong and its really making me reconsider. What advantage IS there then? Anonymous transactions and secure transactions. That's about it. Sure maybe Bitcoin has the potential for zero or very little inflation but but it's so volatile that I don't think that's something of importance at this point. Maybe if it stabilizes but as long as new cryptos come out, the market will probably be volatile. 
From my point of view, one thing that Bitcoin has going for it is acceptance by business's as a currency. Maybe in some areas other cryotos are accepted but I only ever see Bitcoin signs. I think that would have an impact on public perception of it as a real currency and not just an investment. I think that will allow it to stabilize. Other cryptos will still exist but mainly as investments which will keep them volatile. This is all just my hypothesis, I guess you could call it. Maybe I'm very wrong

Interesting video, but it's unwise to draw parallels to a completely different industry.....
Also, Crypto isn't getting propped up financially by the government.....

Why don't they put something on the front of the shelves in the interim? Retail 101

Funny but this is hardly a valid argument. Lots of tech claims to be the next big thing and goes out with a whimper. This pic is just cherry picked successful tech. 
Sure Bitcoin could get added to that list (and I hope it does), but it could just as easy be a tech that goes out with a whimper.
