There is virtually nothing wrong with adding any shitcoin. The problem is that adding bcash was corellated with dumping bitcoin,  spamming BTC mempool and supporting bcash on CNBC "deal with it". If bcash grew as big as bitcoin, it would have same scalability issues.   I think non-segwit TRX's should have one day penalty before being added to next block.

I disagree. I ordered trezor first. I am not american but I know Coinbase usage has some weird tax implications for US citizens, like they report transferring out the coins as sell event which is taxable. Trezor is super simple to use. He needs to rethink where and how to store the device. I consider offline Tails linux with Electrum with 2 of 3 or 4 of 5 multisig wallet with one or more keys on trezors the most secure setup if keys are well distributed geographically. But let's keep it simple. The whole crypto game is about how good are You at securing Your seed words and device which is hackable if stolen (Trezor or Ledger). btw. never split seed words to feel secure. It is way less difficult to bruteforce the missing half.

Given the fact that BTC is not backed by any government, it's price cannot be tied to anything we are used to.

Before buying Trezor I used to use Electrum in Ubuntu Linux. It's far more secure than Windows. The best option would be to have separate pc  eg: laptop for bitcoin/banking only running Linux.

most secure is paper wallet eg printing address with it's private key on a piece of paper, but that is not an easy bitcoin to to handle afterwards. Personally I use Trezor (John McAfee said so :-) ). There are also Ledger and Keepkey of hardware wallets. On PC there is Electrum (Linux, Windows) and Mycelium for Android, but for small amounts like pocket cash amounts.  The general idea is to keep private key/seed in Your hands and not some third party/website.

If Cisco is bought out, they provide more Cisco to the market. If bitcoin is bought out will it provide more bitcoin to satisfy demand?

naked futures will drive price even lower than CME and CBOE.  ETF or Bakkt would drive BTC up but cartel is deferring both.

We paid for the treatment a midlle class New saloon car worth of Fiat for Our son on 2012. I knew btc existed but did not read the whitepaper, which blew my mind in 2017.

Ln cannot without mainchain. The bonus is that when the party you transact tries to screw you over they loose both your and their btc. Ain't that awesome? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:15:27
never listen to what they say, always look what they do. If You are bullish out of halving, disappointing bakkt outcome will not phase You. We never know if CFTC is not influenced by third party.

please stahp!  Has this guy said any lie ever? Everything he said 25 or 30 years ago came true, regardless he was called an idiot. I understand that some of his statements may be difficult to understand because he uses logic at it's purest. He was not elected because people don't want to be free and make money. People like to be given the money. He just says he would tax the taxpayers as little as possible and he would cut the welfare state as much as possible so people could grow wealth. Unfortunately that seems too much for most of people to embrace.

Depending on where you live it is good to sell now and rebuy to realize tax losses to break even your tax.

But if cftc didn't like the product, they always could hold them horses. The regulator is the ultimate approver, but it doesn't seem likely they disapprove.

so far at minute 13 he mentions they have approval from big boys and then they will give the government that approved consensus to approve by regulator.
