Yeah I tried Circle.  They all want too much info.  I think its time to possibly just go back to localbitcoins.com.  Its just not as convenient as being in front of my computer.

Not the same one I saw but has a lot of good info and same problem as me

Yeah I figured.  I wish they would explain why.

I did open a support case, and I got this as a response:

Eric M replied:
Thank you for contacting Coinbase Support.
I apologize that your limits were reduced. You can see when your limits will increase by following the instructions on this page: 
Keep in mind that this limit is temporary. As your account builds a history with Coinbase, this limit will increase naturally (and fairly rapidly). I apologize that we are unable to offer immediate limit increases upon request.
Selling bitcoin online is accompanied by a number of risks, and we feel the best way to manage these risks is to give every customer the opportunity to build a positive history with us.
If you have any other questions, please reply.
Coinbase Support"
I do not have my ID on file.  Only gave Coinbase my login info for my bank (like that isn't enough) and my cell phone number. 
I'm done giving information to company's that do not require it.

Then I got this response when I asked "So does my history thus far not qualify to maintain the 100 daily limit I had prior?"

Eric M replied:
Yes! You have a great purchase history with us. Thank you for being a great customer.
Your limits will be restored when your verify a state ID (like a driver’s license).
The process is automated and takes about 5 minutes. You can complete the process here: 
Again, your limits will be restored immediately after your ID is verified.
My apologies about the confusion.

I don't know how to politly say wtf, and I'm put off by this. To the point I almost don't want to argue.

They had me until they asked for a cell phone. I do not want dual factor auth.  When I get my coins I'll transfer them to my more secure wallet then a web page.

I believe the answer we would all like an answer to is: "Why do you (Coinbase) not notify your users when they do limit increase/decrease" and even include a response as to why would even be better.
