Yours is worse then me, as I only lost around 46 Mil around the peak price. I got given a bunch of bitcoins for signing up for something back in 09 or 10,  bought a couple hundred more for shits and giggles.
Pretty much forgot about it for years until the media hype when it hit $300ish, went to redownload my wallet. Me being a dumb fuck not really understanding how it all worked found that the wallet key was on the HDD of my old laptop and not online like my internet banking....  I threw the whole laptop out only 3 weeks prior... pain..

but if you had unlimited money, then you could do so many things, when your unemployed your only limited to low/no  cost activities to save cash right?
Otherwise you could be buying helicopter lessons and things like that.

Basically, the main problem with Bitcoin is as more and more people that start to use it the higher the transfer fees get as only a limited amount of transactions are possible per second, that is why some people are facing transfer fees around $15-$20 sometimes as well as longer and longer confirmation times as the system gets clogged. Alt coins have been created from scratch to prevent this and as such to prevent these high transfer fees or to eliminate them completely.  
I guess think of it like how Yahoo originally was the king of search engines, but often would give really unrelated results or you would have to scroll through messy pages of crap results to get the thing you were actually searching for. Along comes newbie Google.com and now their search engine is consistently giving you exactly what you were searching for with a clean easy to read website. Nowadays most people use Google so the people don't use/value YAhoo anymore.

I honestly thought it was in some Scandinavian language at first and started looking for the subtitles button.
