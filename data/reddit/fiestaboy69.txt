I sat on the sidelines for far too long and refuse to keep missing this train
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:45:31
Thanks! Best of wishes to you as well!

I think they mean Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:57:17
Lol I wouldn't recommend it. Certainly not for the faint of heart!
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:21:42
Bitcoin core can't be used to buy a lollipop lol
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:50:22
too bad the fee market is centrally planned and not free market
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:43:47
that is real financial freedom and empowerment!
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:51:01
It’s better to leave on an exchange to avoid network fees
@_date: 2019-06-01 03:28:22
Bitcoin is not what is used to be.
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:33:05
So you do not anticipate more people using bitcoin in the future?
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:45:09
The average transaction fee hit a high of $55 last time. [
So you don't expect for bitcoin adoption to grow in the future?
@_date: 2019-06-01 23:07:57
going to be hard to get coins off exchanges when the fees hit $100 again
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:36:25
I'm just waiting for Lightning Network
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:22:47
I lost everything
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:01:49
Does it work?
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:26:54
just look up bitcoin honey badger bill board. Ver is the one who popularized the whole thing
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:57:25
Bitcoin cash has the support of a long list of Bitcoin OGs who were around long before you 
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:14:13
Bitcoin is certainly not in as good a shape as it was pre august 1st lol
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:59:35
this is anarcho-capitalism. Where on earth do you see socialism in what i just described 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:14:24
It's the price we agreed on. Say I grow apples, and you make apple pies. You can make that apple into something worth more than I can. This is how all raw materials make their way into production.
No producer purchases a good unless it makes them wealthier in the end
And they are only producing the good because a consumer wants it. Literally everyone wins from the guy producing the raw material, the manufacturer, and the consumer. No party "loses". The amount of socialist garbage shoved down everyone's throats these days is disgusting
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:30:02
Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash share the same blockchain pre august 1st. It is still entirely possible that bitcoin cash over takes bitcoin core in the future. That is why it will not be re branded
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:09:33
If the price of Bitcoin 20x while whole market 20x, bitcoins market share would have remained the same at 95%. Think about it. Your math is wrong
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:02:45
Bitcoin cash is a client software for Bitcoin as well last time I checked
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:16:13
Umm the source code... 
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:03:22
Mike Hearn, who was head of capacity planning for a little company called Google believes we need bigger blocks, also satoshi. Leaving the cap at 1mb is the dumbest thing on earth. 2, 4, or 8mb, would cause no issues right now and allow bitcoin to be 8x more useful, maybe the price would go up 8x
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:27:53
He's not a bad actor. How do you expect his businesses that pay salaries, and sell products for bitcoin to function if the fees are high?
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:55:05
is that sarcasm?
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:10:59

So you're telling me that if Amazon's market share of the online retail industry fell from 95% to 35-40% in less than one year they have nothing to be worried about? They should continue on the same path and do nothing? This is the logic that is going to absolutely murder bitcoin core
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:03:03
Market share has fallen from 95% to historic lows, civil war between core and cash, merchants pulling adoption of Bitcoin, fees can get unpredictably high grinding transactions to a halt
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:31:13
You were the one trying to bring up math. And it was wrong. If Bitcoin is getting out paced by alt coins that means Bitcoin is inferior. How do you not recognize this? If you ran a business you would be gone in no time. And your childish responses are a clear display of arrogance 
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:01:40
I'm talking about using Bitcoin as money, what it was designed for. You must have drank too much of the blockstream koolaid 
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:28:53
You are aware that Roger is the one who put up the original honey badger sign right?
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:33:22
well it appears my comment was deleted. Never mind there is only one way to scale bitcoin, it will work, Joseph Poon promised
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:55:51
I could care less about bitcoin's price. I've been involved since 2012. The most important thing is for it to be sound money that people use to transact
You are also aware that the amount of wealth in the world is not fixed right? There isn't a loser for every winner. Wealth is created.... through mutually beneficial transactions....
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:47:23
Do you use it to purchase things when the fees are $50?
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:39:31
point me to a single source code repository that says bcash
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:45:35
what makes bitcoin a success is it being a transnational currency. BCH is a currency, i'm not sure what BTC is for anymore
