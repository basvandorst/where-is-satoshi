Past does not predict future. Do you think that bitcoin can grow indefinitely? If no, then you NEED to think about the thresholds at which you want to sell.

We all make guesses, but in the end better to stick to reasonable risk management principles. We can be highly incline to risk but your strategy should never be "All in".
It's better to decide "at this price, I'll sell x% to secure x profit, if it drops at x% I'll take my losses". If you decide in advance, then you don't make bad decisions due to panic nor euphoria.
Edit: I think i mistook you with someone saying he would always hold

Thank you for your answer, and I appreciate your optimism. 
 I was always interested in bitcoin as a decentralised currency. I remember when I heard about it years ago, what caught my attention was how well it could solve a technical barrier in libertarianism. I didn't even realise its potential for speculation, at the time.

No! For me, the fact that you hold even more than 20% of what you own in bitcoin based on the information we have now, is already crazy and stupid.
Maybe you'll win and, for example, get a lot of money, but your initial decision is still bad

Well, no I don't, that's why I'm asking.
Until when are you holding, what is your purpose and why do you believe it'll keep growing?

There's a rock in my garden that'll outlive everyone alive today, it doesn't make it a viable currency

It's fine if you sell some and it keeps rising. What's important is whether your decision makes sense at the moment you take it.
You don't know whether it'll keep rising or whether it'll drop. Soo, it makes sense to take your profit when it's up. That way, you secure some profits and you've got nothing to regret even if bitcoin fell

Do you really think it will grow indefinitely?

Sorry if this is not the good place. I have a question from someone who is very risk adverse, and has never invested in bitcoin. 
I heard that some people are holding all their bitcoins and never sold, even when they were valued millions.
What is the logic and when do you plan to sell? 
There are basically two ways for an asset bubble to burst, which are interconnected: 1) people don't trust this asset anymore 2) there's nobody willing to buy this asset anymore.
On one side, Bitcoin has lost credibility (1) as a currency, mostly due to its extreme volatility. However, for the same reason, it became very attractive as a speculation vehicle, and therefore its price and volume kept growing.
Now, it became so popular that we can doubt demand will keep growing. It's so widespread, that it seems (completely unsourced opinion) that we were close to a point where basically anyone who would be susceptible to buy bitcoin in short term, has already bought some. Your mom, your cashier, heard about bitcoin.
Now, these people are only in because of the quick gain. What will happen when they start losing money? Many will take their losses, and sell. Will there be enough demand to match the offer, enough believers to buy everything that quitters are selling?
Probably not. When you can't sell.. . Prices fall.. And keep falling... Now, both conditions 1 and 2 are reunited. It's over, its a burst.
What do you think?

Blockchain technology, not bitcoin itself though 
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:28:14
Yes it's crazy and stupid 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:14:52
Never time to panic, but think about your exit strategy and how much risk are you willing to take.
Depending at what price you bought, how much are you willing to risk, when is the limit when you decide to take your losses. Decide a limit and stick to it.

I was talking about prices

"if it were an asset rising steadily with a fixed percentage"
Like, what?
