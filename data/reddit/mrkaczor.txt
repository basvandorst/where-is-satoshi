If you take cash from ATM whom you need to trust? Your government and your bank (some private or state owned company) right?
If you have your bitcoin whom you need to trust? math equations right?
what is more reliable, trustworthy?

I am buying every month for sum of FIAT. Hodl till 250k$. Sell half of BTC. Half save for re-buy and half to play my mortgage ;) I can lose all money invested as this is small month sum and it doesn't affect my budget.

Windows lost the race. Gamedev is already shifting to xplatform (eg vulkan 3d) or even android only,  windows will be finished at some point, some professional tools would be windows but this is minor ...
