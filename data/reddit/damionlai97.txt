Looking at the coinbase app, the recent reviews seem to be negative. Any idea how well it works with a Malaysian account?
Edit: It seems that it's not available in Malaysia yet, but it is available in Singapore. Is there a requirement to buy BTC? Like minimum account value etc.

OK, an actual serious question: How do you start investing in BTC?

Sorry for necro-ing, but how does one start investing in BTC in Malaysia? I'm trying to look into it.

I'm with you on this. Bitcoin is too volatile and might be an overload on the kids.

I'm 20 years old, I grew up with my generation looking at these "kids" with their phones and these "adults" who didn't. I've experienced both types of lifestyles. Yes, kids learn fast, but throw a textbook about Advanced Calculus when they can barely memorize the multiplication table and see what happens.

Well everyone had their  own opinions I guess. Though I just think that teaching them about Bitcoin before having them understand how an economy functions us among a lot of steps.

Fair enough

No, I mean the entire opposite, but as kids they won't be able to see the principles and the fundamental reason being Bitcoin. That would lead them to just panic when a dip happens etc. You think a kid would be able understand all that when they're still living off of allowance? They'll think of it as exactly what you guys are saying to be bad, they'll think of it as a means to make a quick buck, because that's going to be a large proportion of what they own. This is what I've been observing my friends are going through when they start looking into crypto. All of them are in it just to make a quick buck, panicking the past month because of the dip. If a 20 year old can't understand the true value of Bitcoin, do you guys honestly think a child can?
Edit: Even more context, me and my friends that I was referring to are Finance/Economics BSC students. I've been trying to tell them what the fundamental ideal of Bitcoin is, but since they're mostly living in allowance and I'm working for a living, they just see it as a financial investment. What Bitcoin is trying to achieve is not something you can simply teach, you need the person to understand how everything works, otherwise it's useless.
