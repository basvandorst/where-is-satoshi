Only if you believe that there is a bubble. IMO, price would have to balloon to over 100k/BTC to be near a bubble. We were given a fully deflated balloon and a paradigm shift.

They did a weird 180 degree turn with just the most minor of pressure where the CEO hedged his bet and said he didn't think BTC would be relevant in 5 years (roughly 3 years ago). I mean, it doesn't matter if right or wrong, but the sudden change and following moves (i.e. VOX) just put a lot of stink in the air. My motto was simple....follow the leaders that don't waiver. We are on a mission here. Nothing against their platform per se. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:29:31
It all has the same stink, I agree. That is just investing. Buffet used the same techniques, especially getting in early. Now he says, but I only do what I understand. I understand Crypto very well, which is why I found it interesting. I did not get lucky because I thought I would get lucky. I got lucky because so many noobs and nutjobs pumped this shit to the moon in record time. I was thinking it would take 10 years to get to 10k. I am very pragmatic and jumped ship when the mania got out of control. Once again, smart, not lucky. A true gamble is to join in on the stock market melt-up right now. Good luck with that!

Never HODL 100% unless you have 100s of BTC. Then the difference between 100 million and 10 million won't matter so much. Tim Draper, HODL my friend. Keep paying it forward.

It took countless hours of watching orderbooks to get a feel for certain types of behavior. If you can't dedicate the time, you will most likely lose your ass. BTC evades most technical analysis, although there are still good pointers to consider from trading techniques. Meta-scarcity is a new phenomena with BTC and other cryptos. Its behavior is not well understood.

a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a nonexistent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.  
The key is nonexistent. Bitcoin is a huge enterprise with many arms of participation. The network is the most secure invention humans have ever created. Just like stocks and every other investment though, early investors are the big winners. Just like Warren buffett

Well, I am concerned about 2 scenarios that could blast my strategy to the graveyard. (1) if any one of the companies I am letting hold the funds renegs, or (2)BTC goes to $0 in less than a 24 hour period. What I didn't say above is that my exposure to any particular centralized company is 30-50%. 
I think both of the above scenarios remain improbable, but anything is possible!

"With our Gold Card, we are reviving gold for the purchase of goods and services. Bitreserve members can convert their bitcoin to bitgold, whose value is substantiated by bullion in our reserve, but still spend it as bitcoin. By creating a bridge between the revolutionary Bitcoin protocol and good old gold bullion, we enable our members to instantly send or spend bitcoin from the ounces of gold held in their Bitreserve wallet. Our Gold Card makes this ancient store of value instantly transferable, infinitely divisible and accessible to anyone with a networked device. Now anybody with some bitcoin and a Bitreserve wallet can have the Midas touch. Old King Croesus would be chuffed"
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:54:51
Well, hmmm...yeah about as much as I trust miners and others in the Bitcoin community. I only think there are a few bad seeds in the extended community. Some of the companies will bend over backwards to remain in good stewardship of the Bitcoin world. Bitreserve is top notch IMO. They seem to have a formidable plan and strategy, if funding is any indicator. 
The CEO has a good track record regarding the business side even if some of his financial decisions are less than appealing.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:23:02
I run a diversified fund. And I started dollar cost averaging at ~ $400. So not the worst entry point. My current buy-in is $303/BTC. However, I effectively bought at $255 since I am diversified into Gold and USD. 
To answer your question. When I woke up and saw blood, I unleashed the hounds and lapped up more BTC. If we just entered the 3rd long-term Elliott wave, the ride doesn't end until well after $1000...maybe $10,000. If I lose everything, meh.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:42:51
Could happen, but I just opened a Circle account since they now offer bitUSD. Now I can reduce the exposure to any one force to under 30%. And now I am hearing of Buttercoin....it is starting to get ridiculous in this space.

The Western Unions and Credit Cards of the world may be forced, by nature, to accept the blockchain. Another workaround is happening in Ripple land right now.

@_date: 2015-01-13 20:45:36
Bitreserve holds physical gold in reserve to back their IOUs. They also publish proof-of-solvency. Like others, they could easily go up in smoke at some point. 
So far, I have had NO issues at all transporting BTC in and out of Bitreserve. I don't think there is a true fix to volatility other than time so I am trying my hand here for now. Perhaps the larger community would like to teach me how to do a better job at getting physical BTC, if such a thing truly exists.

@_date: 2015-01-13 20:48:17
What isn't pegged to something else for value. At least Bitreserve "says" that they back all their products with actual Gold. Maybe that is why they are starting to break funding records.
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:17:29
In times of trouble, there is Bitreserve. You are your own bank. You are your own broker. You can store your reserve dynamically, which means you can constantly swap in and out of favorable situations. 
I am using Bitreserve and several other platforms to run an ad hoc family fund. It's always thrilling. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:22:28
Experimental Perspective:
I initiated a personalized Bitcoin Fund just today. I will be depositing 2% of every check into a checking account that will be used to strategically buy Bitcoin at a steady rate for an entire year. The 2% is equal to what my company will match for the 4% I will be contributing to my 401K. 
The Bitcoin Fund is diversified into Gold, USD, and other alternative cryptos (Ripple, Darkcoin, etc.) at a proportionality that I determine periodically as necessitated by shifts in markets. 
So, I don't really concern myself with price. If it gets shaky, I convert to Gold and USD holdings. 
I have bought Bitcoin 17 times since early October for an average of 355 USD/BTC. Even though it is currently at ~ -10% of that price, my fund is up ~ 3%. 
There are some weapons available to each of us to help shield from wild action and diversify. 
I think 3-day charts are sufficient for making adjustments to this portfolio this year. I for one will be a buyer on the way down.

Bitcoin price has no trend right now. I think that may be why you are frustrated. It could easily slip back into decline if we experience a weekly close below $220. The bull will not rise until we see a weekly close above $350. Anything in-between is purely fodder for day traders.

Yep, BTCVIX. The triangle was less than a half day from having no room left to roam, and BOOM. Those triangles are really a coin toss in my experience. Best to be 50:50 BTC/USD as those progress. I was only in 30:70.  
@_date: 2015-04-23 12:03:53
You could say that, but the way I see it is a coin toss. So I don't want to miss the move up or down. It seems rational to me. Once a decision is made, then you can take the remaining and join in the tank or rally.

I am thinking of how Apple basically spawned the Samsung, LG, Motorola, etc., tag-along boom. I can see a future relationship with bitcoin and other cryptos.

You do not physically own the gold, but Bitreserve does! Every Bitcoin is backed by very asset it is shapeshifting for.

I wonder how technological unemployment factors into all this. The demand for basic human skills is diminishing, while more than ever we actually have a need for advanced human skills. It gets harder to stay on top of the curve.
Bitcoin certainly offers an almost infinite space to play with new ideas, all centered around bringing resources into synchronicity with human needs. Avoiding outright collapse would be a bonus.

Hands-down, Bitreserve offers the best experience I have yet had with bitcoin. I am always anticipating their next move. Most of their investment instruments are most suited for those with some deeper pockets, and as of yet it hasn't caught on to that extent. It should be interesting if and when it does.  
The fact that it is BTC in/BTC out is of no consequence for those of us here for the bitcoin experience in the first place. Since I am not investing more than I can afford to lose, I have decided to go all in with this single centralized source....just simply as good as there is out there right now with the Reservechain. 
I am surprised Coinbase and others are so reluctant to move toward full transparency.

It's on the balance sheets of the Fed and ECB though. They own a mountain of shit so other corporations and banks don't have to show it on their balance sheets. But it is there, tucked away for a beautiful unraveling of everything you know...except BTC.

I am sitting at right about 10 BTC with an averaged cost of $271. I am also using a piece of my check instead of investing in a classic retirement vehicle.
I am now feeling the dichotomy of wanting to spend it just as much as I want to save it for the moon. MUST HOLD.

A few months back I read that the prevalence of scams in the BTC world is a clear cut sign of its ultimate success. Human history is apparently littered with spectacles that became mainstays after the scam/scandal/spam phase came to pass. I don't know if anything has ever propagated so many scams in such a short period of time as Bitcoin and other tokens.

Hello, 36 years old here. I have totally ditched all conventional thinking in favor of shiny, shiny Bitcoin.
Better Gold than Gold...how can you beat that?

Mycelium, I personally love the name and concept behind interconnecting hyphae always brings back good memories. However, there is a problem. 
You picked a fucking name that triggers every drug-related agency in the world. Your packages are ABSOLUTELY being searched for drugs. 
Maybe it is time to rethink your situation sooner than later...Darkcoin to Dash.

I moved back to Coinbase when I couldn't get the confirmation button to engage over and over again. That was going to be such a great company. Dead to me now.

Probably not the best indicator, but one to consider. Criminals almost always go for low hanging fruit first. So they get in the mix and do some easy hacks, take the easy land, come up with a simple pop-up ad script, etc. 
If their actions are seen by the larger community as suspect, i.e. enough people care in the first place, then the community starts building an immunity to the scammers in an attempt to legitimize  particular activities and/or ideas. Sooner or later enough participants reach a critical mass and we get copper boom towns and the Internet.
Next up perhaps: Nanodrones
I can see a time in the future where drone technology permits the creation of bot swarms. If low hanging enough, all kinds of human activity could emerge around fly-sized spybots. Almost guaranteed to spawn a lot of criminal behavior, like non-consensual voyeurism and hacking boardroom meetings. 
Oh no no, no one would feel comfortable with that shit. Immune response and the birth of another agency and perhaps counter-spying industry.

First of all, stop investigating this mess. Karpeles is your man, and he was not alone. He will be thoroughly punished for the rest of his life.
Now, we need to thank him for advancing the evolution of BTC and getting the deeper conversation going at hyper speed. Let us also note that the price of BTC failed to reach where it started, implying that the artificial pump/dump scheme has given rise to an organic ascension.
All it takes is a few outlaws to get the trains moving.

I think the up and coming Synereo platform is also working in this arena. They plan to go a step further by integrating reputation (Reo) and cryptocurrency (AMP) into a social network. 
It appears Bitrated stops short of the social network aspect, which means there may not be the ability to distribute content to its users. 
At Synereo, create content and get paid with respect to your online reputation. Exactly how they plan to pull it off without overwhelming users with foreign features is something I struggle to understand.

Doesn't matter. Even more suspicious. And then they open it, and whala...must be drugs on this unlabeled package. 
No one is complaining about Nano Ledger, and I don't buy the argument that the seals are breaking due to perturbations while shipping. The package is way to small and light weight to cause it to shear. Unless it was thrown around like a football. 
These packages are being searched for drugs...only explanation.

I would also add that the "Willy Bot" was a huge success. That algorithm did more for Bitcoin than anyone has by sending off the greed detectors of every single institution on Earth...even non-profits. Without Willy, we would probably still have little ability to talk about where BTC fits into the world. Now we know the answer is EVERYWHERE.

Ditto, but this potential revolution is a long overdue Enlightenment. The intelligent people of the world are (finally) gonna get to make some of the rules again!
And the Blockchain cannot be dumbed down any further than the electricity used to make it run.

Hmmm....which begs the question. If these whales are dumping 100s of BTCs at a time, they would have to run out, or buy back at some time. Do you suspect they are manipulating in both directions? 
I suspect the longer the adoption rate of Bitcoin remains below a critical threshold, the longer we will be exposed to the demons and phantoms. 
Taking a peak at the Bitstamp chart, there seems to be several recent failed attempts to drive the price below $210. Everyone concurs this to be the level that would cause another bearish move to $90-150. Makes me wonder if these playas are responsible for those downspikes.
Regardless, until they succeed, that fear cannot be recognized. We are one or two BULL WHALES away my friends.

I have resorted to the exact same tactic. Immersion in the game is the only way to learn the complex things of modern society. 
If someone needs to understand Bitcoin or would like to engage, the first question out of your mouth should be "do you have a phone (Android preferred)?" SHOW THEM what it is, and do not explain it to them. After they see the USD show up as bits, eureka...sometimes. I did this with my cousin, who has an IQ of about 80 (not kidding). He was like Ohhhh. I didn't tell him a damn thing about what IT was. 
Now this has failed before too. The other person I tried this on was like, "I have to install an app, I don't do that kinda stuff". So there is that too.

I read somewhere; you don't have worry about people stealing your ideas, most ideas have to be stuffed down their throats. 
We will just keep stuffing.
