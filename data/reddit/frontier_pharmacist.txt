THANK YOU this info was exactly what I was looking for!
I saw another commenter around here mentioned to shave off 1-2% per month when selling on an uptrend for the first year, then 2-4% monthly on the second year, etc. The uptrend is measured by where it was 6 months prior. I'll use this technique with the new info you posted. Thanks!!

That's why I posted it here instead of clogging up the main feed with a dedicated post. Thanks for the help.

So I took the plunge and put in a big lump of US$10K in December when it was around US$3,800 per 1 BTC. I chose $10K because that's an amount of money that I could live with totally losing, but is also enough to reap some significant gains if things go well. I promised my spouse that I wouldn't invest another penny.
I want to hold this for at least 25 years. And I'm not allowed to invest any more new money into it (or my wife will kill me, ha). However I *am* allowed to reinvest any BTC gains back into itself.
During this 25 years, I'm sure there's gonna be a couple more all-time-highs, and another couple downward rollercoasters. Is there a practical technique on how to take advantage of the highs and lows for reinvesting into itself?
Thanks in advance.

Sigh, I had a hunch I'd get responses like this posting here.
I know about buy low sell high (c'mon now), but what I meant was, let's say it hits $25K next year. It will probably tank again half a year afterwards. I'd like to methodically sell some of it as it rises (not all), and then inversely repurchase as it falls. I had assumed there was some kind of rule of technique on what percent to take out and when. You know, a trading technique with a name, like "dollar cost averaging," "value averaging," etc, but with a lump sum. Is this not the right thread to ask this question or what?

Thanks for a genuine reply.
Your technique sounds interesting, but it seems like it needs quite a bit of active monitoring. Or are stops/triggers all you need?
