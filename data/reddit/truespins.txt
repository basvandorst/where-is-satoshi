I made a similar mistake. I sold some BTC the second the scale of the loss was announced. I rode the fall all the way down, and was about to buy back in when I thought "I bet this goes lower"... so I made the classic BTC trading mistake - I went to sleep.
I woke up 4 hours later to discover that it had made a partial recovery, so I bought back in. Still made a little profit, but kicking myself for being greedy!

That's the dream. To be honest, when I was buying at 300 bucks I felt like a sucker. Nearly sold at 1k in late 2013 but didn't and then spent 3 years in Crypto purgatory. Essentially forgot about them until Jan 2017 when we hit 1k again. Then watched in awe as we went up and up.
Strange feeling when your investment is so nominal, and you end up up sitting on a small fortune. Didn't feel real. 
Cashing out was a sad day, but that's why I kept one which I will hold until I die.
Biggest regret is selling 100 eth at 50 bucks because I was sure it was a bubble waiting to pop. Doh. But overall can't complain.

It doesn't need anywhere near the current level of energy expenditure. The only benefit is that it makes the chance of a attack less likely, although I'd argue this is completely negated by having highly centralised mining in one country.
The biggest danger would be a huge drop in hashing power after a difficulty adjustment. Bitcoin updates the difficult quite slowly, so if the network lost a lost of power it could take aaaaagggggeeeees for the required number of blocks to be mined before the difficulty dropped. 
Back at the last block reward halving there was genuine concern this might happen if it became uneconomical to mine.

My partner used to be similar. If it's not in the bank it's not real. I've heard it's all a scam. The news said etc etc... 
She was also annoyed I spent so much money on a USB stick "when you can by them for a few dollars". Wasn't interested in my explanation of the merits of a hardware wallet.  
However, after I sold a little and chucked 15k into our joint account, she now always wants to talk about it. I would have done this anyway, but was funny to see her change her tune. 
To be fair, I had been speaking about it for years, and until recently not much had happened.

A bit simplistic.
People sometimes make mistakes in life and get trapped in a spiral.
Some people are a lost cause, but others just need a bit of breathing space to get their act together.
I've witnessed good hard working people fall down. Lucky people will have good support structures around them - friends, family etc - but some are truly on their own.

34k is a reasonable amount of money for most people. Also when people in the UK say life savings they usually mean cash in the bank, not equity in a property or any pension arrangements. Just uninvested cash.
The guy could have hundreds of thousands of pounds in other investments and a beefy pension, but could still refer to this 34k as life savings. 
I've noticed in the US, when people talk of savings they include everything, including non liquid assets - which always strikes me as odd.

There are lots of people like myself who bought BTC at a few hundred bucks or less. Cashing out at 13k, 14k or 15k really doesn't make much difference to us.
So when we see btc slowly bleeding value, it reminds us of 2013/14 all over again and we head for the exits.
I love Bitcoin, but I've sold most of mine at this point and it only accounts for about 40% of my portfolio.
I truly wish all BTC holders well, but I don't know how much longer Bitcoin can rely on brand alone. Ethereum is quickly catching up. Once Ethereum surpasses BTC market cap, I think all hell will break loose. I don't even like Ethereum that much and have huge issues with the cult of personality around its creator, not to mention the way previous forks have been handled, but the market appears to be speaking. 
The situation isn't helped by Ver causing confusion with BCH, but it's only a tiny part of a much wider issue.

Wasn't too hard. It was best part of 70k (had a few alts I dumped too). Biggest headache was trying to work out how to pay the least capital gains tax. In UK we get the equivalent of about 16k usd untaxed a year, and I can also gift my wife bitcoin that she can sell... So that's 30k usd tax free. Currently going through process of declaring remainder.

I bought at around 300 - 5 coins in total so I about 1.5k deep. It was certainly money that I could afford to lose, but equally the price mostly hovered around the 300 mark (with the odd dip) between 2014 and 2016 - so I was pretty sure I'd get most my money back and if not, oh well. Mostly got involved because my brother in law wouldn't shut up about it and I had horrible images of him becoming extraordinarily wealthy and me being really annoyed. Fomo, really. 
But once I scratched the surface I fell in love with the idea of Bitcoin. Back then (post 2013 run up) because actually because the price was pretty stable and the network uncongested, it could be used relatively effectively as a currency. Indeed, I actually sold a few things online for Bitcoin, slightly increasing my savings. 
When bitcoin hit 1k in Jan 2017, I was already sitting on some substantial savings and selling wouldn't really have made much difference to my financial situation. 
I only really started paying attention at 5k. Again, the money would be nice, but I didn't need it and there seemed to be a lot of momentum. 
At 10k it started to feel more serious, and I spoke to my wife. We both agreed to wait a little longer. 
When it hit 20k(ish) we got kind of greedy and thought it might go up even further, so I held. It then fell quite violently back and I thought enough is enough and sold at 15k.
I know I technically missed out on the best part of 25k, but in the grand scheme of things I appreciate I was very lucky, plus I never dreamt it would hit 10k, let alone 15k.
My last bitcoin will never be sold, and will sit safely on my hardware wallet until it's worth nothing or... well... Who knows.

If you're in UK, set up a Revolut account. Create a Euro wallet. Link it to your CoinBase account. 
Then send Euros from Coinbase account via Sepa. Convert Euros to GBP fee free via Revolut. Then either keep money in Revolut, or send onwards to your bank account. 
I've done tens of thousands of pounds of transfer this way, and never had an issue. Starting limit is 25k per year,  but you can easily get it increased. Also, fee free exchange is 5k per month, which can be a pain. 
Revolut is really cool though, crypto aside. They also offer debit cards (virtual and real) so you can technically use them as a bank. 
You can send directly to your bank account, but you'll get hit with rather large fees and poor exchange rates (as you have to send in euros).

He recognises that this isn't a normal market as we know it and that the rules don't seem to apply.
He falls back into character towards the end "Blockchain Good, Bitcoin Not so Much" but overall I don't think he's being particularly unfair.

This is nonsense. The Bitcoin protocol does not demand this level of energy expenditure. People are free to mine Bitcoin, but nothing compels them to. I suspect that what will happen is that mining will become a regulated activity, much like how I'm not allowed to drill for oil in my garden.

Gavin Anderson - hugely involved in Bitcoin's early development. Made himself a little unpopular due to certain comments and association with Craig Wright, but he was very important to Bitcoin's early success. 
Hal Finney - provided early support and helped get the project off the ground. RIP Hal. 
Ross William Ulbricht - provided the first real use case for Bitcoin, albeit illegal. Now paying the price with a life sentence, he pushed bitcoin into mainstream consciousness. 
For me these are the top three people.

Eventually any coin that gets big enough will have to face the cold hard reality of the wider financial markets.
As I always say, if Bitcoin can't survive this it doesn't deserve to survive. I understand your feelings and a sense of wanting to protect Bitcoin, but if we want Bitcoin to succeed it has to be able to face the big boys and win. 
I'm holding. But I've been holding for four years now and I'm fairly used to the ups and downs. The only time I've lost is when I've tried to predict the market and make "clever" trades.

I agree. A blocksize increase as a temporary solution whilst long term scaling solutions are developed is essential. I have held my BCH because of this very reason.

It's got to be more profitable to support the network than to attack it. But energy usage won't simply increasing as nation states wouldn't allow excessive consumption to cripple their grids. Regulation will be imposed, limiting the ability to mine.

Ultimately the XRP explosion is being caused by newcomers looking to 'invest' relatively small sums of money and being put off by the prices of the main coins.
If you don't give a flying banana about the technical merits of the coin, would you rather have 0.0010 bitcoin or 100 XRP? Which sounds better and more exciting to you? What's more likely? Bitcoin goes to 30k or XRP goes to $3? If you're just looking to double your money and you don't care about decentralised money or any of the other stuff cryptocurrency enthusiasts hold dear, XRP is the obvious choice. 
This is all that's happening and the only question is how high and how long it can go.
That said, the same could also be said for many coins at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:19:46
I sold about half at around 800 bucks on the trip to 1k in late 2013 and kept the rest, although diversified a little over the years into a few alts.
I should have held onto them all, but then again I can't predict the future and we did subsequently spend 3 years bumping around the 350 dollar range - so it felt like the right choice until recently :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:21:58
I'm confused about the futures stuff. Under the proposed setup won't there always be a counter party to any short position? So it won't be possible for people to pile in on the short side unless there's relative balance on the long side?

The way I see it, if Bitcoin is replaced, whatever replaces it can also be replaced. That's no basis for a currency / gold 2.0. Why would anyone want to use Crypto if at any moment another coin could simply replace it?

What? The amount of Bitcoin you get  per unit of Fiat will depend on the currency. 
Sure, if I buy 10 USD of Bitcoin I will get less than if I buy 10 GBP of Bitcoin, but it's a meaningless comparison because the purchasing power of GBP is broadly equivalent to 1.33 USD at today's rates. 
Whether you buy it using dollars or Swiss francs you're essentially going to pay the same.
There may be small arbitrage opportunities, but unless you're buying vast sums they'll be eaten by fees and transfer costs. 
Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question?

Despite the claims of FUD, the energy use of the Bitcoin network is worth talking about. Obviously, whilst there's nothing inherent to the protocol that demands this level of electrical expenditure, the economic incentives do mean that generally speaking as price rises so does hash power.
Now, my view is that you can't extrapolate from this early period of Bitcoin's life to state that this trend will continue indefinitely. I believe there are certain economic and social realities that mean energy consumption will eventually even out. 
For example, Mining has in recent years moved to highly specialist chips, rather than GPUs. There is still some pooled mining activity, but the big Miners are operating on an industrial scale. The capital setup costs for someone wanting to get into mining is growing by the day, and is essentially unaffordable for the majority of the population. In the future the ability of regular Joes to participate in Bitcoin mining will be the same as their ability to mine for oil - it just won't happen.
Equally there will be social realities such as restrictions placed on mining activity if a company was having an adverse effect of the local grid system. A bit like how you can't just drill for oil anywhere without permission. I expect it will become a regulated activity. 
But of course  the great thing about Bitcoin is that if government did step in and start shutting down commercial and no doubt regulated (more social realities) Miners, individuals could start mining again to both protect the network and make some money at the same time.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:56:46
Exactly this. Although on the other hand they'd be up against lots of other large scale investment firms doing the same, which could really mess up their timing and cause huge losses. Imagine if you drove the price of Bitcoin up by placing huge buy orders. But before you could liquidate your coins someone else did. You'd do great on your short position, but be rekt in terms of selling your Bitcoins back to the market. Probably net break even at best.

It does seem possible. The Bitcoin market is quite small, comparatively speaking.

I heard an interesting discussion that it probably makes sense for miners to take out short positions via the futures market. Set aside 10% of their profit for this purpose.
So if Bitcoin rises dramatically, they will make a killing on the mining side, and a modest loss on the short side. If Bitcoin's price crashes, the money they'd make on the short side would help with any immediate cash flow issues caused by the loss in value of their mined coins. 
Interesting concept really.

Me too. I actually enjoyed the relative price stability we had from 2014 to 2016. Sure, things got a bit stagnant around scaling solutions, but at least there was a real focus on the technology.

For those of us that got into crypto years ago, this is a problem. Suddenly what was a small amount of money is worth a lot. I decided to cash out a little recently because whilst my actual investment was minimal, it had got to the point where the loss of potential profits would have been hard to stomach.
A good question to ask yourself is 'if I had this amount of money in fiat, would I invest it in Crypto right now?'. If the answer is no you need to pull some out.

To be honest, any coin will have to go through this moment. You can swap to an alt, but eventually any coin that gets big enough will have to face the cold hard reality of the wider financial markets. 
As I always say, if Bitcoin can't survive this it doesn't deserve to survive. Plus, if Bitcoin crashes I guarantee that the alts will crash with it. 
I'm holding. But I've been holding for four years now and I'm fairly used to the ups and downs. The only time I've lost is when I've tried to predict the market and make "clever" trades.

Of course it could flop. You could buy $500 today and tomorrow it could be worth half. Or it could be worth double. 
My personal thought is that the ETF will be rejected and prices will fall about 200. But that's just me, plenty of others here believe the opposite.
Either way, I don't really trade BTC. I just hold some as a long term punt and then use some to buy the odd thing. If losing a few hundred dollars worries you, I'd advise against buying Bitcoin. It's a high risk investment. 
But the real answer to your question is no one knows.

Bitcoin is man made. The code has so far been robust, although we have seen issues in the past, such as when someone used an exploit to generate almost 2 billion bitcoins - resulting in a fork. 
Is it possible that another exploit could be found? Certainly. Is it likely? Probably not given the number of years that have passed. But depending on the seriousness of the exploit it could certainly destroy Bitcoin overnight. 
Again, highly unlikely. But to suggest Bitcoin is on par with the fundamental laws of physics is laughable. 
Need I remind you that SHA-1 has been compromised.
I love Bitcoin, and I hold a reasonable amount. But I also don't bury my head in the sand in terms of potential risks.

The biggest thing that has worked against public acceptance of Bitcoin is that it spiked wildly in 2013 and then collapsed in value. To the uninformed observer, that really fits with the media narrative that Bitcoin is a "scam" or a "ponzi". The fact it has now shot passed its previous ATH and that, with or without the ETF, it is making inroads into mainstream finance can only be a good think in terms of public opinion.

Faucets are scammy and no way to get started with Bitcoin. 
However, you've got to remember that this is still the wild west and many of the rules are still being written. 
It's not as bad as it was back in 2013 when bitcoin first got the attention of the mainstream, but there are lots of shady actors around looking to take advantage of renewed public interest. 
In terms of bitcoin cash making money out of thin air, it is a somewhat unusual situation I grant you. That said, some would argue that without Bitcoin cash, BTC would be worth more. The last few days do seem to suggest this may be the case, as when Bitcoin cash rises BTC falls, and vice-versa. 
But essentially people buying Bitcoin cash are gambling that it will replace Bitcoin, and it's that conviction you are seeing played out in the pricing. Sooner or later I suspect you'll see a huge value shift from one to the other, as the dominant chain becomes more clear. 
Honestly, bitcoin is really great tech and reddit is only one place to discuss it. This particular sub isn't representative of all users, and more mature discussion can be found elsewhere. Consider this sub more of a casual lounge where people unwind and just talk crap...

I suspect the only time "the establishment" worried about Bitcoin was in the spike of 2013. At that point the systems limitations weren't as well publicised and there was a sense that Bitcoin could be hugely disruptive. 
Nowadays most in this community see Bitcoin predominantly as a store of value, with less utility as a currency, and I doubt the corporate world or governments are particularly worried about it.

That's great but if you're wrong you will lose out. Like when I became convinced Eth at 50 usd was a bubble waiting to pop and sold 100. A sweet 5k. But had I held onto them they'd be worth 30k. That's why people say hold.

It's a more interesting question for those of us that are now sitting on tens of thousands of dollars after a relatively small investment a couple years ago. Even when you've recouped your original investment, holding gets harder the more the price rises...

Reason? 
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:44:14
Depends on the site. Some sites don't actually store your private keys. Rushwallet.com for example actually uses the URL as the seed for your wallet, so in theory if the site vanished you'd still have access (with some difficulty). That said, it's not a good storage solution for anything other than small amounts as anyone with the URL can make-off with your coins.
Sites that hold your private keys - if they shut down your coins are essentially gone. That said, if they are properly regulated you may be able to get the money back through a legal process - although that's going to be a hell of a headache.
Most people here will advise you against using a third party website and to store your bitcoins locally.
You can do this using either a Desktop Wallet (such as Electrum), a Paper Wallet (whereby you create an address offline and print out the private key and keep it secret) or a Hardware Wallet.
Hardware Wallets are the best option, but you have to buy one. Paper wallets are probably the next best thing, but you need to know what you are doing or you could inadvertently lose everything. 
Desktop / Mobile Wallets can be risky, as PCs / phones can easily become infected with viruses / keyloggers etc.
Most people here will have most their "savings" in a hardware wallet / paper wallet. They'll normally then have smaller amounts in a Desktop / Phone wallet for general spending. 
If you want to trade, you'll have to entrust your coins with an exchange. Things are a lot better than back in 2012/13, but that doesn't mean your coins can't vanish.
IMO opinion, the complexity of storing Bitcoins securely is the biggest barrier to wider adoption. We still don't have the "killer app" that would let your average consumer make use of Bitcoin without having to worry about hackers. I think part of the reason for this is that for a long time Bitcoin users resisted regulation - the wild west mentality suited them. However, the community has matured and I think it's recognised that we need regulation of sort.

What about expensive works of art? Why do they have value? A copy would be just as pretty, so the original is no more useful than a cheap copy. The reality is value is almost entirely a man made creation. 
I say almost, because there are clearly some things that humans need to survive - food, shelter etc - but beyond fulfilling basic needs, value is entirely dependent on the belief things have value.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:27:43
Actually an interesting paper. In real world use their attack vectors would prove somewhat unreliable (the jump from identifying a transaction, linking it to a website session and then linking that to personal information requires a very specific set of circumstances), but still food for thought.
Something like LN might actually help a lot, as it would seriously obfuscate the timestamps, making it harder to connect sessions with blockchain transactions.

Fair enough. You are right to not invest more than you are comfortable doing. 
I wouldn't get too hung up on the whole "1 bitcoin" thing. If you bought gold you wouldn't expect to buy a full 400 Oz bank brick, you'd probably buy 100g or something.

Why are you using Bitcoin Qt? If you just want to buy, spend and keep Bitcoin, a lite wallet like Electrum would be much better. That way you don't have to download the entire blockchain. 
Bitcoin Qt has its uses, but for the average user it's pointless downloading that much data. I actually worry people get put off Bitcoin because they start downloading Bitcoin Qt and think "to hell with this".

I now know you have a large quantity of money. First thing I'm going to do is go through your post history and comments, looking for any identifying information. This might not be anything concrete, but might provide other leads. Maybe you have a website that you've mentioned... Maybe you mentioned the area or town you live in, a school you went to? Do you use same username on other sites for forums? You'd be surprised how much information people give away, often without realising.
You're assuming attacks are limited to hacking. With that sort of money someone might be even tempted to pay you a personal visit. 
You just gotta be careful.

Yes, on this occasion it worked out for you. But equally Google could have announced they were going to integrate bitcoin into all future products seconds after your trade, and you'd watch the price shoot to 20k knowing you'd missed out. Extreme example, but the point stands.

You never really own bitcoin in the traditional sense, as they never leave the blockchain - that's the public ledger that tracks everything.
It's more a case of controlling bitcoin, which you have the ability to do with your private keys. 
To put things simply, you can confirm ownership of bitcoins by looking at the addresses for which you have the private keys on the blockchain. 
The reality of course it's that this all goes on behind the scenes, and your chosen bitcoin wallet will simply show you your current balance. 
In terms of governments declaring it illegal, it would be very hard at this point to actually shut it down as the entire network is decentralized. That said, a nation state could in theory make it very hard to convert between bitcoin and their respective fiat...

If you've got bitcoins on a Ledger Wallet or Trezor, I'd just suggest you make your partner aware of the device (and backup seed) . If the Bitcoin price were to blow up in the years after your death, they would be able to take the device to a trusted professional (solicitor etc). Remember, if the price really did explode it would mean Bitcoin was no longer a niche thing, and it would be less risky seeking support. 
That's fine with one or two coins, but if you already have lots of capital sitting in Bitcoin you're going to need to leave clear instructions somewhere.

Thousands of the earliest mined coins have never been touched. It's assumed that Satoshi must have the corresponding private keys. However, despite sitting on a fortune, not a single one has ever moved. Some speculate that if they were to start moving the price of Bitcoin would crash - the logic being that a big draw of Bitcoin is its obscure origin and associated myth, and that moving these coins would undermine some of this. 
As to why they have never been moved, particularly early on, possibilities are:
- the keys have been lost
- Satoshi is dead
- Satoshi is not interested in money
- Satoshi knows that by selling them he/she/they could reveal their identity

Nowadays you could set up a professional website in seconds with no knowledge at all. 
Equally, think about online gaming. That used to be a nightmare even for technically minded people. Dropped packets, clunky server browsing software, alt tabbing between games and mIRC etc. Nowadays every idiot with a ps4 is playing online. 
I believe bitcoin will continue to exist, and will rise in value greatly. But I'm thinking decades, not months or even years.

We see this on r/Bitcoin everyday, and we've got some really "clever" programmers and IT people here.

The Internet came for shopping malls. And won. The Internet came for taxi services. And won. The Internet came for travel agents. And won.
Now the Internet is coming for your banks and gold. 
It will win.

I thought crypto was all about control. Yet you're celebrating a commercial organisation making decisions for users?

That's a bit below market rate for anal. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:48:23
The fact EVERYONE thinks it is going to go down after fork and seems to be waiting suggests to me that it wont.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:21:03
I'm continuing to hold both. Helps me sleep easier.

Good luck with the transaction fees.

My house has apparently increased in value by almost 100% in the three years since I bought it. It's not improved in that time. Apparently that's great and as the government and experts are eager to reassure us, not a bubble. Yet bitcoin.
I guess I'll ask you one question. Can you point me to another example of a completely decentralised global currency that existed prior to Bitcoin. Because I assume your opinion is based on some sort of evidence?
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:39:58
Maybe. Maybe not. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:56:18

It's an overreaction we see all the time in this sub. I guarantee no one is going to care about your 330 bucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:07:52
Essentially you are trying to retrieve your private keys. Bitcoin qt requires you to download the entire blockchain, but wallets like electrum make use of centralised severs so you can see your balance and transact without downloading the blockchain yourself. In theory I don't see why you can't export your private keys and import them into electrum or any other lightweight wallet. That way you don't have to sync with the network. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:58:03
Depends on how much money is on the line. If you've got over a few thousand USD probably worth it. Less and you might be comfortable with a paper wallet.
They are really good though.

As long as you haven't sold your BCH you'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:08:21
As I understand it, yes... Because until the transfer is confirmed the funds still reside at the original address. That's why it's possible to 'cancel' transactions if you're quick by double spending with a higher fee.
Although the above is assuming you control both the sending and receiving address. If the coins are being sent from an address you don't control, that address will receive the fork coins if the transaction is not confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:39:56

It's over that now. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:14:39
The drop from 1k back down to mid hundreds after the Gox scandal was pretty scary. Many thought Bitcoin might actually be dead. And that lasted a couple of years. Although I remember it being more sad than scary - it felt like we'd nearly got real mainstream attention and then fell on our ass. 
I'm fortunate that nowadays the daily swings are many multiples of my buy in price.

Wife's anus. No one ever gets in there. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:38:21
This is why I hold. I don't think it's likely but if 2x goes horribly, Cash would be the obvious substitute. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:58:43
Why would the owners of Bitfinex, which is presumably very profitable, risk going to prison by scamming their users? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:36:07
Depends how long ago you bought in. When the daily fluctuations are many multiples of your buy in price, you become rather ambivalent about it all.

"While traditionalists opposed a higher block size, they favored a technical fix called segregated witness that moved part of each transaction outside the main blockchain."

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:08:36
LOl... no you didn't. Bitcoin reached around 1k in late 2013 before falling back to 300 over about 12 months. It never got anywhere near $4000, let alone in early 2013.

@_date: 2017-11-26 20:00:11
This is how bitcoin works. The entire sum is sent and the rest returned as change. I've never used Trezor, but on nano s you don't see individual address balances. However you can use the xpub key to see balance of the entire wallet.

I bought most my coins when you could do it through Circle. However, I have purchased small amounts via Coinify and always found the process to be smooth. I had one issue with my Bank initially declining the transaction, but once I confirmed it was me all was good. 
Compared with some of the other options in the UK - BitBargain.co.uk and LocalBitcoins - Coinify is actually not a bad rate.
You might want to check out Coinfloor.co.uk - I've got an account with them in case I ever want to sell, but I've heard good things and they are UK based with GBP trading.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:48:51

As other guy said, every ATH is followed by a slight pullback. Mostly people taking profits. You've got to to remember at these prices a few hundred dollars is only a small percentage change.

@_date: 2017-11-01 13:36:44
Just remember that some people do not consider a private key that has been exposed to an internet connected device as secure. This is the main problem with paper wallets - creating them securely can be a bit of a pain. Depending on how much you have, might be worth thinking about a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:50:53
Because Bitcoin has no scaling solution. Look at Bitcoin Cash, it's up about 25% today. I think the market might be speaking. That said, entire market seems to be dumping a bit... most coins down circa 5%.

I do believe that the recent rise is unsustainable. That said, I don't think Bitcoin is a bubble like the mainstream media are trying to imply - it's already had multiple crashes and it has survived. Even if it crashes it will survive and continue long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:31:44
People that dismiss Bitcoin as a tulips need to understand that the protocol was a breakthrough in computer science: it built on 40 years of research in cryptography by tens of thousands of researchers around the world. This is so much more than just some elaborate get rich quick scam - despite what most posts on this sub might suggest. 
Bitcoin combined the speed of the internet to enable global, fast, real-time transactions in a practical way by solving a computer science problem called the Byzantine Generals' Problem. This, in effect, allowed for trust between different parties over an untrusted network such as different banks or the internet. Critically, it removed any need for a trusted "middle man" such as a central bank, government, or clearing house. Instead, trust was created through what is called a Blockchain, the decentralised system that underpins the invention of Bitcoin.
The possibilities that this new technology has opened up are mind-bending. So when we hear uninformed people dismiss it as "tulips", you can understand why we get a bit defensive.
The mainstream have yet to truly comprehend what Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies can offer... But they will.

If we're talking about public addresses, you could email it to every hacker on the planet and your balance would not be at immediate risk.

You could always use a non-internet connected clean machine to test your private key and make sure it grants access to the same public address.

You simply store your private keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:15:03
In a sense, something can only be used as a currency if it is backed by the perception of value. This is why I support this multi layered approach. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:30:32
Try harder... 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:42:46
You'll need to import the private key to your chosen wallet and send to the address generated by the hardware wallet.

Yes, yes it is.

Can't you just export your private keys to something like electrum? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:49:01
Yes, it's called profit taking. Those actively trading Bitcoin buy and sell with the intention of making money. When the price spikes dramatically, some will sell. If enough people do the same supply outpaces demand and price falls. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:01
Urghh... Go and read up about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:41:37

You can always check the blockchain balance using the xpub key. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:20:27
I always ask critics to point me to another example of a completely decentralised global currency that existed prior to Bitcoin... Strangely enough they can't.

This is an amazing bit of work. Well done. Have book marked.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:17:51
Well, the Bitcoin blockchain is essentially a public ledger - so it's just a case of terminology. Blockchain is the actual name, ledger is a description of what the blockchain does.
However, are you sure you're not hearing people talk about the Ledger Hardware Wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:17:58
Unless you're using a third party service to manage your funds, any wallet will honour it because your wallet simply contains your private keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:23:20
The website has pretty much zero info on it. From the looks of things the disk thing is the actual device, the rest is just a box. Presumably it's similar to a standard hardware wallet, except you access it via your phone using a bluetooth connection. Interesting concept I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:44:41

Lol yup. Hopefully we'll get rid of the morons that have no idea what they've invested in. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:47:16
The value comes from the network. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:49:00
"Coinbase sent me an email saying I was transferring funds and the bit coin address is completely different than the Ledger app address that was generated to my account."
This is surely a compromised PC / Phone. Sounds like classic clipboard modification. If you didn't actually send the coins to the address generated by the Nano S, it's no surprise they never arrived. Some malware sits on devices, and waits for Bitcoin / Crypto public keys to be pushed into the clipboard. Once there, they are swapped with a new address (owned by the hackers) and funds are sent there.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:53:55
I'm personally on the fence when it comes to scaling solutions. I think we probably need some sort of block size increase whilst we develop robust off chain solutions. As a result I'll continue to hold both coins. So far, despite the Bitcoin price pullback I'm actually up due to the rise in BCH.
Don't let blind ideology influence your buying and selling decisions.

So you're saying there's a chance. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:47:15
Because it has no scaling solution and Bitcoin cash is rising.

@_date: 2017-11-18 21:28:46
Just hold both. Like you I got the forked coins and I'll just sit on them. Not going to try and guess how this might all pan out. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:47:23
I preferred the place when the price was stagnant around 300 bucks. Now we're full of get rich quick idiots who don't care about the tech at all, just the price. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:39:05
Good luck with that, Joe. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:30:28
No. 
In the case of losing Bitcoin, you could potentially restore if you had your seed. If they are stolen, they are gone.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:12:38
There is a real risk to Bitcoin if Bitcoin Cash continues to rise. The problem is there are no immediate plans on the table for scaling, and Segwit seems to only be providing limited benefits.
I will continue to hold both as I suspect it's going to get bumpy.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:55:47
Because alts still pretty much follow BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-24 21:31:18
This. People need to understand that Bitcoins exist purely on the blockchain. What's in your wallet file are the private keys that give you control over their movement.

@_date: 2017-11-19 21:16:39
Going through your points:
1. Yes. 
2. There's a statement from their auditors that their cash reserves technically match their USDT sums, but no guarantee they can a) access then or b) that they are ring-fenced for this purpose. 
3. This is not correct. 
4. This is true, although this may simply be to avoid falling foul to currency laws. Still worrying though.
5. Source?

I've said this before, but you'll get down voted to hell. The bitcoins I purchased in 2013 are now technically worth 10k each due to forked coin value. I have a preference towards the core vision of off chain scaling, but I'm not going to start making bets on it by selling stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:19:38
Bitcoin can't keep just going up, day by day. We need growth in many areas besides price - development, infrastructure, business acceptance, scaling solutions etc etc. I'd much rather we sit around the 8k mark for the next 6 months rather than some sort of boom and bust cycle.

If bitcoin cash ends up with more hashing power and more value, bitcoin cash will be bitcoin.

Basically there is something called USDT which is essentially a crypto that is pegged to the price of the dollar. It's a centralised crypto, but the organisation behind it guarantees the price by holding the equal amount of USDT in USD... Or so they say. It's useful for exchanges and users because you can get the equivalent of USD onto an exchange without having to worry about international transfers etc. 
However, there is not a huge amount of transparency about who is behind Tether, nor are there clear audits proving beyond reasonable doubt that they do indeed have USD for each tether 'printed'.
The conspiracy theory is that they are essentially printing tethers that are backed by nothing, and then - depending on who you ask - manipulating the market or committing outright fraud. 
The truth? It's hard to know. There is some evidence that the correct funds do exist, although it's not a full transparent audit. Equally, some of the conspiracy theories seem to come from misunderstandings of how Tether actually works. 
There's also the additional conspiracy that Tether is intentionally pumping bitcoin (core) with its 'fake' money - at the expense of other alt coins, obviously.

I used to have quite a bit, but following the Dao they showed their true colours. It's essentially a cult of personality with their leader happy to disregard any libertarian principles the moment it suits them. Not what is signed up for so I sold pretty much all my holdings for Bitcoin and other alts back in 2016.
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:03:19
I'm wondering the same thing. Sure there's been some interesting news out of Russia and Japan, but the general tone seems to be uncertainty at the moment. So surprised by the recent gains. 
I'd thought maybe the fiat withdrawal block on some exchanges was pushing up demand for BTC.

You speculated and you lost. That's all there is to it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:58:09
Problem is, bitcoin isn't actually that useful at the moment, and certainly not compared to other more modern cryptos.
People were essentially betting that Bitcoin would nevertheless remain the gold standard of cryptocurrencies, but now even that is up for debate. 
Combined with the Tether situation, the newbies fleeing the sinking ship, people are understandably worried about Bitcoin's future.

Coinify lets you buy with just a debit card. Only very basic ID - I think it asks for a mobile number, and validates prior to purchase. Has quite low buying limits though and I think the fee is about 3% on cards. Have used it for small purchases in the past (talking a long time ago now) and it always seemed to work.

Bitcoin mining is not gambling under any definition I've ever seen.
Miners don't gamble any money when mining. They burn energy and have upfront capital costs, but that's not something any definition of gambling covers.

People have been asking whether it's too late to invest since it hit $1.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:46:29
I remember buying at around 300 and wondering whether I was making a mistake. That was just before the big run-up in late 2013. It then slowly crashed during 2014, and then in 2015 I thought I might as well buy a little more, again at around the 350 mark and again thinking I was probably making a mistake. 
Then as it started heading to 700/800 in late 2016, I bought a little more, again convinced I was making a mistake.
Turns out I was actually making pretty damn good choices!

It's not even meaningful diversification if you really have such a large investment portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:32:15
If your total savings in the world are 5k, bitcoin is not a wise investment at this point in time for you.
Sure, it could go up dramatically, but its could also fall dramatically, and putting all your worldly savings into it (or anything for that matter) is not wise. Maybe buy 1k worth if you really want in, but I wouldn't recommend investing the whole lot.

You'll need to find an exchange that allows you to cash out into your preferred Fiat, but yes... You can buy a bitcoin for 5k and sell for 5.5k and keep the difference (minus any exchange fees). This is what people do every day when trading bitcoin.

I've got my BTC, with associated BCH and BTCGold
I've got LTC - I see it as a backup to Bitcoin and an interesting test-bed for new developments
I've got XRP - not a fan, but if banks get serious about blockchain, who knows.
Can't bring myself to hold ETH, although would probably be sensible.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:51:45
Try coinify - they don't seem to ask for any ID (aside from a phone number) and you can use a debit card. The limits are quite low and the fee is about 3%, but its pretty quick and easy in my experience.

No one really knows what the "average" amount of Bitcoin owned by Bitcoin users is, so no real way to answer your question.

So you've got about 40k of Bitcoin, and you don't bother with a single backup?

Yes, I didn't mean to be dismissive about the amount, I was just thinking about possible transaction fees etc if he splits the purchase over a number of transactions.

I think the bottom's negative 2000. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:32:16
I think the reverse. Bitcoin needs its mysterious origin story. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:44:41
BTC believes bitcoin should scale via a blocksize increase and feel solutions like segwit and off chain transactions are either not future proof or not in the spirit of the original vision.
Bitcoin believes that an increase in blocksize will centralise bitcoin due to increased bandwidth requirements. 
The former wants bitcoin to function as a currency, the latter are happy for it to function as a store of value. Satoshi's white paper would seem to support Bitcoin as a currency, but his later posts did seem to support the store of value concept - a new asset class if you will. 
Between the two groups is probably a reasonable solution, but it's sadly devolved into dogmatic mud slinging.

That's not how contact law works. You can't just hide clauses in a ToS and expect a court to uphold them if they are clearly detrimental to one party, especially to the extent this would be. 
I suspect this is simply a way to get around restrictions that exist in the states about creating alternative currencies.
No court in the land would accept those terms as legally binding.

I think when the alt coin bubble pops, bitcoin will go nuclear for a bit, as most alts can't easily be traded into USD - you have to go via BTC. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:05:59
The problem alts have is that if they topple Bitcoin, they will demonstrate that Cryptocurrency is not a viable store of value as any coin can be replaced. Any winner would potentially face the same fate as Bitcoin. That is no basis for a new economic system. 
I find it very hard to imagine a scenario where Bitcoin can be replaced as the dominant player.

In terms of your question about "difficulty", yes - the difficulty scales depending on available hashing power.

LTC is basically bitcoin. The code is almost identical. If btc dev stalls, it would be dead easy to jump to LTC. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:18:00
I think you're not recognizing that you never buy or sell bitcoins with the exchange itself, but other users. So in your example you bought 1 BTC from a user for 100usd. A week later and you see the price has gone up to 150 USD and you want to sell. To sell you essentially sell your Bitcoin to another user, who would have to have enough money on the exchange to complete the transaction. 
All the exchange really does is connect people and skim profit off via fees. The majority of money they hold is user money. In theory, provided they are operating correctly, every user should be able to cash out.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:19:10

This seems more of a critique of Ethereum and it's trustless, 'immutable' smart contracts. 
Bitcoin is essentially just a method of exchange that (not withstanding your points)  removes the need for a central organisation or middleman.

I'm in the UK and have found Circle a good bet. I've never incurred any debit card fees and the exchange rates are reasonable - especially when you compare them to the horror of bitbargain.co.uk and the like.
Weekly transactions are limited to 200gbp, but from the sounds of it that won't be a problem for you.
Your other option is to wire money to an exchange, but you'll end up messing about with documentation and waiting for payments to clear. Circle is essentially instant.

Although it seems simple to us, buying and selling Bitcoin is not something that the average "man in the street" would be able to do, at least not without some serious reading up - wallets, seeds, public and private addresses, blocks... it's quite a lot to take in.

There are no experts here. Bitcoin is completely uncharted territory. Most of us on the sub are invested, both emotionally and financially, in Bitcoin's success. To be frank, we're probably the worst people in the world to ask for impartial investment advice.

It is potentially traceable. 
I'm assuming you're in the UK, so let's assume you buy using Circle via your debit card. They will send BTC to an address of your choosing. 
You then complete your trade in the darknet, sending the BTC to another address. 
In a worst case scenario someone could theoretically trace the coins back through the Network back to your Circle account, and presumably home address.

I'll be honest. If you're having to think so hard about whether to invest a few hundred bucks or not, Bitcoin is not for you.

Personally I use a desktop based wallet for amounts up to a few thousand. I've tried quite a few wallets and I like Electrum as it's fast and lightweight. 
For amounts beyond a few thousand I'm a big believer in cold storage solutions, just to isolate them from the Internet completely. There are plenty of guides, but worth experimenting with nominal sums to make sure you understand how it all works. 
I'm not a big user of phone wallets, although my experience with mycelium has been reasonably positive if you really want to go down that route.

Think about it. 
If someone has a guaranteed way of doubling bitcoin, why would they offer this as a service? They wouldn't. They'd just quietly keep doubling their money and become extremely rich. 
However, as you state, these scamsters will sometimes "double" a small sum in order to gain someone's confidence and convince them to transfer a larger sum (which will promptly vanish). 
As such, you can sometimes beat them at their own game and get them to double a small sum, and then promptly walk away - but obviously still a major risk you'll lose.

Sadly, I see less and less people talking about real development opportunities. Nowadays it all seems to be about "HODL" and dreaming about what we'll do when Bitcoin hits a gazillion dollars.
I always thought that Bitcoin might be the basis for a web-wide tipping system or a way for webmasters to accept micropayments for access to specific content - allowing them to move away from Adsense etc. But sadly, what with the increasing fees and lack of consensus re blocksizes, a lot of development seems to be on hold :(

It was probably more a rant about this community. I used to visit back in 2013/14 and it really felt like Bitcoin had the potential to be a viable currency. Nowadays we seem content with it being a "store of value", which in my mind underplays the true potential the tech has.

I agree. 10k suddenly doesn't actually seem like that big of a deal at the moment.

Well, if you compare it against fiat, it could technically keep rising forever due to inflation. In terms of purchasing power, it will rise in value until an equilibrium between demand and supply is reached. 
We're also at a point where significant news could double the value in a couple of hours. Imagine if Google suddenly announced that it was fully supporting and integrating Bitcoin throughout all its platforms. I honestly believe you'd be looking at a 10k Bitcoin in a matter of hours.

Bitcoin isn't going to stabilize anything...

Yes. Move along.

Ethereum doesn't scale much better than Bitcoin. Faces exactly the same problems Bitcoin does if it becomes as popular.

No one knows.

Possible, but overall I think it's quite positive as its hard to talk about Blockchain without mentioning its origins - which can only be a good thing for Bitcoin.

If I'm honest, I'm not sure whether Bitcoin is really reflecting the economic turmoil of Brexit. Take today, the FTSE100 and FTE250 both closed down, the GBP dropped even further and various property funds have essentially frozen investor's money - but yet Bitcoin doesn't move.
I appreciate it's gone up a lot in the last month, but that was prior to Brexit (which no one really expected) and hasn't really been influenced by other events.

It was more the drop to 2500 reported by Coindesk that surprised me. Lasted a minutem

It seems strange they'd wait for conf when its a digital product that they can withdraw access to at any point.
