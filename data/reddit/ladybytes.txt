im capable of more than holding a sign ;) i think we need to raise the bar. i want to use products, use services, provide feedback &amp; then put my name behind it if I think its good. i want to advertise companies who are really trying to bridge the gap between mainstream public and the ultra smart bitcoin fanatics. i want to advertise for companies that I believe are truly innovative and doing something pretty damn awesome... maybe the companies should be choosing the women, not the other way around... just more food for thought

Did she say her name is LadyB? how original... 
Anyway, i know youve been working hard on this idea, so good luck!
Also, perhaps this isnt the place to discuss this, but ill go ahead since ive been reminded of this issue after visiting one of your advertising client's websites linked on your site. I am super eager to learn more about bitcoin everyday...and I often click around to different bitcoin sites--services, products, news articles, whatever. When I get to the "about" section on a site, I've been finding more often than not, it doesn't actually *say* or describe what the company or service provides. Is it just meant to be only understood by miners/techies/nerdies? If I was ever going to do a sexy ad, I want to be sure as hell what I'm putting my name behind. But if I can't understand what the website is talking about, pretty good indicator that I'm not welcome there. So what the hell is [greenbtc]( even selling?  
EDIT: so yeah, you might want to think about making the site more female/laywoman friendly. if i was going to seek out a job through your site, the first thing i want to see on the front page are the job offers, categorized by similar products/services, or even a short blip about what im actually advertising. the classier, the better :)

Hi everyone, please do not send anymore bitcoin to the address in the pictures and videos. Here's the new one: 1J7T1xQk2mdEEb5wkP73EtXTox6vWvE7ML
(please vote this to the top)

Aw, I'm sorry you feel this way. In my opinion, you're really going to miss out on something spectacularly fun. I was just getting to the idea of "custom ordering" photos, poses, maybe even videos... I think someone out there might enjoying flipping me a bitcoin for making pancakes in my panties... or whatever else their imagination might come up with. This is the future :)

Where I live, women having taken back the words whore and slut. Not so demeaning anymore ;) And it's great that you mention prostitution as the oldest profession; it always has been and always will be drugs, sex, and booze that stand the test of time. cheers!
@_date: 2012-03-29 23:28:19
Thank you, *thank you.*
I am definitely going to make more tutorials. I've always thought that Bitcoin needed a "layperson" to explain things...and I think everyone would agree that we could use some more females in the project. 
My job will be complete when Bitcoin is adopted as the real, functioning currency that it is. And if that means getting the ball rolling with a few hot pictures and/or services, count me in ;) xo
@_date: 2012-04-03 18:52:27
Excellent. This will be fun and I think we are going to create something awesome...
@_date: 2012-04-14 16:56:15
mmmm moar please! what a gorgeous product!

Well what do *you* use bitcoin for? 
Bitcoin is decentralized for a reason. It says "hands off" my decisions on what I do with my life and money. It's absolutely beautiful, really. Bitcoin upholds the essence of anarchy and encourages local trading through a brand new currency (mind you, a currency that has a wonderfully deflationary value, *and* won't cripple when global economy crumbles). 
I think dialogue and debate is essential for any transition to a new government or new currency, and I am happy to respond to unfavorable comments concerning Bitcoin. Thanks for getting in touch :)

I guess they're not meant to see it then :) 
@_date: 2012-03-29 17:15:51
apparently...

oh, and [this]( looks interesting . anyone have a copy? ;)

greedy thieves :(

Do you know of a cam/model site that doesn't require a bank account?
And what do you mean by "some shitty profit thing"? I thought that was the whole point of bitcoin. You can tip your favorite blogger, favorite model, favorite activist group, give money to whomever you want, whenever you want all anonymously. **That is the beauty of Bitcoin.** 
@_date: 2012-08-01 06:47:48
damn it. this is too useful. i hate the idea of weapon/firearm proliferation, but I am entirely pro spreading the use of bitcoin. ugh. what a beautifully disgusting conundrum.
@_date: 2012-09-03 00:02:28
*my most gracious thank you :) 
@_date: 2012-04-03 18:51:29
*Definitely* Things are in the works....
Let's do this!
@_date: 2012-09-02 23:41:00
Let me know if you have a cool project or service that you'd like me to check out and review. also, if you like my video projects, consider flipping me a coin or two. 
thank you!
@_date: 2012-04-03 01:26:26
I don't hate the *idea* of stripcoin either. It's the branding that I find unfavorable...
@_date: 2012-06-15 14:38:58
way to go charlie! this is such a fantastic interview!
@_date: 2012-03-29 17:19:25
Ah, thanks so much for the encouragement. Much needed after seeing everything this morning. I'm not disappointed that I lost my bitcoin, I'm disappointed that people are overlooking how incredible this artistic "service" can be. Bitcoin is an amazing currency, and this project highlights just one of its many useful applications. I hope this gets figured out...
@_date: 2012-07-09 14:48:06
Politely speaking, I think you're making a bigger deal out of the exchange than it really has to be. Simply put, you are there to "pay a bill", and the cashier really doesn't care who you are. They don't even know you're buying bitcoin. I've done the exchange twice, and haven't been asked for ID...and yes, stick to cash.   
@_date: 2012-04-07 02:41:58
I think you got your [wish]( ... ;)
@_date: 2012-03-29 18:18:08
Can you block coins from leaving this account?!
@_date: 2012-03-30 02:01:19
ah, thank you! after my first big whoops, everyone is taking such good care of me. much appreciated :)
@_date: 2012-04-07 02:42:51
Done and done! Welcome to our [Chateau]( ;)
@_date: 2012-06-30 03:22:27
no worries, lets see if we can mollify some of that social anxiety :)
no printout. you just hang up the phone, and walk right over to the cashier. they have something on their computer screen that says someone just "ordered" a moneygram. so basically:
You: I need to pay for my moneygram, please.
Cashier: (looks at computer screen) You're throwmeaway77777? 
You: Yep.
Cashier: Okay, just use the pinpad (the debit card pin pad) to verify your information.
You: (press buttons)
Cashier: Alright, that'll be $23.95, please. 
You: (hand over cash)
Cashier: (hands you a bunch of receipts for the transaction)
You: (walk smugly away knowing you just purchased digital anonymous currency to rule the world with)

Something terrible has happened. I never received more than 1.5 bitcoins :( Did I get robbed, or has instawallet fucked me over?
@_date: 2012-03-31 03:20:44
back at ya you sexy lady ;)
@_date: 2012-05-15 03:38:55
im totally fascinated by this idea. i dont care how far-fetched it might seem. i want to know what it would take to make bitcoin happen in africa. seems like bitcoin emerged a little behind the curve on this one, as 2008 would have been the year to launch...somalia had been functioning without a central banking system for 15 years, until [2009](
So according to BBC, "because it (Hawala Funds Transfer System) operates underground and with no proper records, American authorities were keen to introduce regulation into the system". Gee....I wonder why...
The informal money transfer market is valued anywhere from 300 billion to 700 billion each year. (I know, big spread...but its *informal* nature makes it near impossible to value) Hawalas currently charge 1-3% in fees, while World Bank and other international transfer services charge 10% or more. [source](
uggh, bastards.

I had a really pleasant experience using it in NYC, then made a little [video]( on it. oh...and the video is semi-nsfw ;)

this is a pretty low-stakes art contest. you could even call it "borderline silly" with a title like "wizardry wankOff"
