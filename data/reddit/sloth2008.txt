got my coins last night so lots of time for confirms.  went to transfer out this morning and 5 hours still sitting at pending.  Has anyone actually managed to get their coins out from coinbase or do they only take deposits?

There was a thread the other day that talked about upping the block size.  The default setting for the miner is 250k.  With upping that to 500k more transactions get into the blocks.  The change is just a simple setting so no real changes are needed to the client.  The limit that the network can deal with though is 1mb.

The permanent loss of the coins from future circulation means nothing.  The value of 1 coin is based on what people value it at.  In the end there will be 20M coins instead of 21M.  The value people place in the coins will not change.  There will not be a scarcity in coins.  You will just see a move in the decimal place that coins are exchanged at.  Today everyone talks about the value of a stick of gum at 1/1000 BTC.  In the future it will be 1/100,000 BTC.
You will only see a change in your net worth if you hold your coins.  Everyone can hold their coins and in the end they will be worth nothing since they have no value besides the fact you have a bigger stack of them the the other guy.  If all you do is hold coins then Bitcoin is just a pyramid scheme.  The only people who will make out are the early investors.  There will be no new people involved in BTC since there is no reward for getting involved late.
BTC lives by being used.  There has always been a finite supply of the coins.  That number is just a little smaller now.

damn ASIC buyers.  Now my CPU is useless :)

Thank you.  This is basically what I was looking for.  Figured someone had to have pulled all the info to one spot.

Sell a few coins now at 26-27 and sit on the cash waiting for the drop.   Buy back at 13 and you double your BTC holdings.
That or watch it climb to 50 while you drink away the cash you are holding, wonder why you sold so low and realize you will not be able to buy back in when the bubble pops.

You can set it up with multiple exchanges on the one screen.
Try importing layout 358.  It is a simple layout with the 4 on there

Also consider that with ASICMiner you are not paying for anything but he share price.  With the other options you have to pay the "rent, labor and power" portion.

They get a % of each trade.  But also consider they take a % from the buyer and the seller.  2 low volume buyer/seller make a trade and they have 1.2% of the deal.
In the last 30 days 3,133,000 BTC traded.  At .60% they took 187980 coins for themselves. The cash value traded during that time was $333,000,000.  So $1,998,000 at .6%.    Not all traders are low volume so you can expect those number would be cut by maybe 1/3
You buy 1 coin they take their cut from the coin purchased.  So you get .994 btc
You sell 1 coin at $100 and you are credited $99.4
