Experienced macroeconomists understand money very well.


I'll try. Bitcoin is simply form of gold standard and will be banned just like gold. Modern economy needs elastic money supply.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:13:10
bitcoin doesn't have elastic money supply and is useless for monetary policy

1 You can't use gold as money. You can't pay taxes with gold. You can't issue debt nominated in gold.

It can't. Bitcoin will be banned in all countries

most US dollars are used for regular goods, most Bitcoins are used for illegals stuff


You should learn history of usury. When there were no banks average interest rate was 30-40%. Central banks were designed to fight usury but they can do it only if money supply is elastic. Bitcoin has fixed money supply

Bitcoin will be banned or heavily regulated but not until it will reach $80-100k

understanding of macroeconomics. if bitcoin will become really popular it will be dangerous for financial stability
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:09:19


banks are terrified of world economic collapse
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:16:25


that's what r/Bitcoin doesn't understand. Fixed money supply is dangerous for economy. Gold standard caused Great Depression.

Greenspan is just trolling.
Austrian dum dums have nothing to do with real conservatives

Majority of population will support government actions to stabilize economy. Internet is not that important, US lived without it for 200+years.

drugs and weapons mostly


At 30% interest rate? I'd rather go to regular bank
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:13:08

@_date: 2017-12-27 09:40:42
Central banks want to ban bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:08:05

Only 7 million workers and 7% of GDP
