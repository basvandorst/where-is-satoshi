Look buttercup, your not getting it.
America worth trillions.
Bitcoin worth $120 Bill... and its an artificial price. 16 million of the 17 million in circulating supply is just being held, which causes an artificial price.
All 17m Bitcoin are not worth $7k each
Only 600,000 of them.
If 16 million bitcoin were being traded the price would be so cheap.

This is not the bottom, lol.
Y'all going to get shook out, and it might be two peaks before you do but it will happen.
How I know?
Well because everyone has their price, and that Bitcoin is going to find new ownership.
Just like it did from a price of $20k
So last thing,
If you gave me $20k USD
And I gave you a single bitcoin.
You lose $13k USD in btc value,
So your at $7k USD now.
You are quite down from your latest peak.
What makes you think anyone is going to give back $20k any time soon?
I know it is the future, this is the future, Bitcoin did lambo, it has been out for 9 years.
Investors who rally this back know* it is a death trap from the new holders lol. "I am not giving your $13k back"

Did you even read what I said?
I am not talking about your conformed socially constructed english grammar.
I am talking about why this is not a good time to buy the dip... OP's topic is about buying the dip. My comments were based on this topic on why you should not buy at $7,400.
You are in the subreddit.
I told you that people loss a lot of USD value in Bitcoin.
They are not going to get paid back by those same people.
So again,
If I sold you one bitcoin for $20k and you lost 75% of your USD value.
I am not going to buy it back from you for $20k
Unless, there is new demand, no one is going to buy back your loss.
Idk why that was so hard for you or anyone else to understand.
Just because you do not like what you hear, or just because you hate what you don't understand. Stop going off and assuming false truths. You know nothing of me, anything you classify me as is judgemental, classification, not nice, and ultimately a social construct. In this case, one with little merit.
P.S. - Get off your high horse.

The issue, is that the satoshi is a social comstruct. Similar to the dollar.
The difference is that the dollar is backed by enormous wealth.
Where as Satoshi's are valued at an artificial price of $7,250 a bitcoin.
Considering the daily 600,000 bitcoin being traded...
There are still nearly 16.5million bitcoin that are just being held, and not being traded.
That all being said, satoshis manipulated artificial setting is what makes US Dollar still and always dominant.

It was imminent considering everyone was spending bitcoin gains on ALTs. Could potentially go down further cause people have put some good money into Alts. It almost feels to good to be true. Potentially cordinated pump and dump. Moreover the top 20 or so coins on coinmarketcap according to percentage change in past 24 hours are all premined coins. Which is sus asf.
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:55:28
Sorry man what I said was false to begin with.
Price is in artificial construct.
Rather it be America's construct, Satoshi Nakamoto's construct, or any other nation's construct.
That being said,
What give it value?
Well it has been given value equivalent to x amount in usd, euro, yen, eth, etc, and so on.
People usually exchange their government issued currency and majority of crypto currencies that exchange back in forth through the bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:55:49
I am not determining Bitcoin's evaluation.
Nearly 600,000 Bitcoins in 24hr trading volume has been already evaluated at nearly $7,300USD Which gives this 120b estimate*
I am telling you, that no one in the world, is going to pay you or anyone else back their losses.
Get into a good crypto, Bitcoin has a potential low of $3k If you can get bitcoin below $6k consider yourself lucky and rare.
It will bounce back, but it has to trench and stablize, and I am telling you right now, the market is not stabilized whats so ever.
Maybe with $35b but not $120b
Cryptocurrency portfolios are like Jenga blocks once you pull a portfolio who is holding up that structure it will tumble.
And it can repeat over and over again? How? and why?
It is simple,
The portfolio finds new ownership.
This is commonly referred to as HODLing because again your that jenga block holding for a lambo.
If that were true, then that's when you will sell you bitcoin, and that bitcoin will find new ownership

I just want to start off by commenting my first initial thoughts on your phrasing of the word, "construct".
Currently, right now, from my understanding, a number of individuals, for whatever reason have hit a point of interest in psychological constructs, the way we think, why things are the way they are, social constructs, social engineering.
This is critical to the infrastructure on the way we think, rather percieved, or heard.
Often times, these things are associated with manipulation and you can think you see it all the way up the food chain.
As it relates to OP post.
I question your definition of vision.
If you are saying Satoshi did not use his imagination to create and develop the white paper I am going to have to disagree with you.
Although, I understand your idealism about being fair launch of other split versions of Bitcoin. I do not believe they should be able to use the Bitcoin name.
"Construct your own"

Kinda of hard to say specifically. The market grew from 16B to 820B then crashed 70% down to 195B and is now back at 470B.
16B -&gt; 195B
I cant really call that a bottom, it was a 70% decline, but bottom is an understatement.
However, its different from 2013, now that if is confirmed crypto is the future, we can see people begin to bank with these cryptos like Bitcoin on a daily basis.
If your trying to find a good buy price... just hurdle money everyweek in there. We are dealing with 5, 10, 15, 20+ year investments.

Just don't be a nay sayer. Get your point across and tell them to be optimistic. The best thing that could happen is if they buy into a coin (after research) and they make more money off there $75 investment. Worst thing is they lose $75 and odds are they aren't going to be completely wiped. Idk food for thought. Sometimes just got to have faith, as some things defy logic and be optimistic and trust there instinct and intuition. &lt;3

One word.
Adoption 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:53:28
You will see that at any moment Bitcoin is going to be more profitable. You are right miners will switch.. but once they do it will be harder to mine. Giving the opposite less hashing power - making it more profitable 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:39:49
Sounds good man, It's hard to take people's word in the crypto space, just have to use due diligence. BCH is not natural, it's being forced and I think that right there should be a big enough sign. Plus where is the adoption? Just people cashing in to make profit then cashing out. Try looking into Vertcoin that could be very promising as we enter into 2018. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:20:11
If only a few miners switched, would it balance out or is it one or the other? and is mining profitability everything?

Yeah they shouldn't use Bitcoin that's for more civil and established customs. But we do have a second class coin called Litecoin. I'm sure they will love it.

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:33
BCH not the .co I would say Litecoin is the .co - .net
BCH is not even conisidered as extension prolly .tk

Yeah Vertcoin has a strong community, they aren't newbies over there they know that Vertcoin is going to Vertup with major upside potential. Also they are one of the earlier coins to adopt Segwit, which is very promising if Bitcoin overcomes the attack.

They have about 15 hours or less to take over, or the mining difficulty is going to flip and Bitcoin starts to go really up again.

I would think that you would use Litecoin for such a small purchase. Although it would consist of may zeros as well. Spending BTC may be not smart.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:22:47
Litecoin beats in transaction times and fees. Similar to the hype of Bcash. But Litecoin has real history. And it's super undervalued. Depending on your investment budget and if it's short or long term. Litecoin is looking to soar.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:16:54
Buy Litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:02:32
Was it a purchase or what was the situation? I bought $75 worth and got charged only 75 cents 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:18:11

@_date: 2017-11-21 20:31:51
Oh really, didn't see your flare? This is all based on adoption. People who know the industry will get involved. They will rally the price. But after that. It will decrease. Idc what you have on your belt. This has been happening since launch. If you don't have common sense I don't see you understanding. But pretty much adoption gets practically capped. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:13:10
Bro thank for the insight so far since I clicked on it, it was at 80,250 so is this a bad sign? Hate to be the one to point it out and talk about it but I'm a bit scared. Even though its only by x0.05
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:38:55
Soon, and people will hate it.

@_date: 2017-11-25 18:22:21
You must've not heard about the voting mechanisms this tech can provide. Technically someone could put beliefs into one of these coins, and rally the price to most expensive and we all follow that because people believe in the idealogy. I'm thinkling end of the world? Mark of the beast?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:27:01
Yes the next to $10,400 and then cash out rob $9,600 and then up to $11k and above
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:16:47
bitcoin high is 7,800 close but almost. Well bitcoin is like the .com it's not like there isn't more extensions or (alts) but its the history and phenomenon

The same theory with all the web extensions. The .com has historical significance due to the phenomenon of the internet. Bitcoin is like the .com
Arguably Litecoin is like the .net

Price is relatively high. Just go with $50 worth of Bitcoin and tell them to never cash out and then $75 to play the market (other alts) $75 other gifts.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:40:13
Step 1: buy alt coins for real returns. You may have lost the opprotunity in bitcoin. Make sure buy some bitcoin but not a lot.

@_date: 2018-11-22 20:09:44
Bitcoin lost significant hash rate. As miners redirect their mining power to determine the outcome of Bitcoin Cash ABC vs. Bitcoin SV. The idea is that whoever has the longest chain, or mining power will prevail. On a side note, we are taking both creators words for it. 
This simply could be another scheme by Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and Craig Wright who have socially constructed and engineered a fake dilemma to further attack Bitcoin.
I have yet to see this accusation that I am making now.
Do not let the whales shake you out.

This sub has sadly turned into daily Price Mongering, FUD, Shills, Non-Technical Consumers, with very to little glorification of Bitcoin's progress and adoption.

BUT IT STABLIZED?
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:31:06
In accordance with new updated technological applications recently being implemented, I would have to go and disagree with this statement. BTC was worth around $1,000 but most panic sellers, are going down to the 2-4k mark, meanwhile most if not all alts going down 90% or more. Why? Because there is no use for them. Only certain cryptos such as Bitcoin, will continually being updated and growing. Most other shill cryptos will be bankrupt, disagree, don't progress, can't operate, and fizzle out. This will then be your time to buy.
Note: Bitcoin has the opportunity on skyrocketing past all-time high again before this crash will begin. Why? Because of demand. new applications being processed right now are going to drive the market. If they don't you will hold crypto and have no reason to have it, nowhere to spend it. Note note: A lot of premined cryptos completely screwed the market on top of selling and mis information. Met some guy at my local gas station and he went on to say how he "runs facebook group pages" and just "hosted an invent in vegas" so i mean, people are just out of control. It's not over, it's just over for now. As most people get back to reality. Some of losses some with profits and the show called, "life" goes on. Meanwhile 2 year slow crash with demand never being reached and then boom 5 years from now, a bank will sell them and Bitcoin goes 100k and above.

WE will be at denial for a minute. There is no way crypto market is stablizing $250B marketcap. From a puny $13B marketcap sub 2017. That being said the worst is too come. Unfortunately us humans want your bitcoin for cheap and $5k is not cheap enough. Even with a bull rally back to $16k would not be enough to rebuild euphoria level of ATH.
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:44:57
It wont go to $1k USD because we will all buy more than one full bitcoin.
It wont go to $2k USD because we will all buy atleast one full bitcoin.
It is possible to call $3k USD the new all time low if demand does not occur. I can see bitcoin hovering around $3k mark as the coin will move from hand to hand before stablizing.
If demand does occur, we are headed back to $5k - $6k USD mark.
If that happens within the next three months. There may be a strong FOMO energy that begins to pick up mid-spring and may carry to $10k USD in the fall of 2019.
The 2020 memes will be super hot like never before. The $10k assumption will just be the minimum as people will have fear of the $20k USD ATH.
