Question: can you spend a change of unconfirmed tx? If yes, what will happen when that unconfirmed tx get cleared from the mempool (because of low fee)?

There is a tool directly from Trezor to claim BCH - 
I didn't test it though.

When BCH had more hashing power than BTC? AFAIK most they had was like 1/4 of total hashrate.

The bright side of this is that transaction fee cost less now ;&gt;

Yep I had 20 BTC on Bitomat when admin decided to increase memory of Amazon service causing it to reboot and wipe wallet. I received all the coins back from MtGox after some time.

How does fee estimation works on Trezor? AFAIK you can't use custom fee, right?
I'm thinking about buying Trezor too, but lack of custom fee option worry me.
