Shorting is a tactic you can use to make money from an asset loosing value. You borrow the asset, sell it, wait for it to fall, buy it back and repay your debt, pocketing the difference, for example (These are completely made up numbers), lets say Bitcoin is worth $6000 now, and we think it's going to be worth $5000 tomorrow.
- I get a Bitcoin loan for 1 BTC
- I straight away go and sell that 1 BTC, I now have $6000.
- I wait until tomorrow, where the Bitcoin price falls to $5000.
- I buy 1 BTC for $5000
- I now have the 1 BTC I started with (which I can use to repay the loan) AND an extra $1000 profit.
So, to break down what OP is saying:
- Lots of people have taken Bitcoin loans.
- All of those people have immediately sold those Bitcoin, expecting the price to drop.
- The price is slowly rising instead.
- If the price continues to rise, this will cause all the people who are trying to short Bitcoin, to buy back their Bitcoin and repay their loans in order to minimize their losses, further increasing the value of Bitcoin. This process will likely happen automatically in what is called a "Stop-Loss Order"
Obligatory: This is just me trying to simplify what OP is saying, I do not wish to take a position on whether the price will go up or down.

A credit card doesn't actually make the payment instantly. In fact, the merchant doesn't receive the funds till long after, a credit card transaction is merely a promise to pay.

I'd point out that Bitcoin is hardly the vessel of drug purchase they say it is, Dollars are used FAR FAR more for drug related purchases. In fact, [90 Percent of US bills carry traces of cocaine]( while [the majority of illegal of illegal goods are bought with US dollars](
I'd also point out the many, many good uses of Bitcoin. At your age I'd point out that it is very useful to be able to pay cash to a local trader and get an online currency you can use to purchase games, servers, computer (parts).
You could also mention (if it applies) that you do not like the banking system, and are worried about trusting a bank with your money, if you consider Bitcoin far safer (I personally do, having had many problems with banks myself)
On the basis the school is supposedly taking, Discussion of the dollar should also be banned.

This simply isn't possible from a technical standpoint, your wallet cannot be decrypted without the decryption key. Without your wallet, you cannot send bitcoins anywhere.
Besides that, there is no way to detect when anything tries to decrypt a wallet.

I'm English, but when I think it comes to gun control, I think the reality is both US and UK are correct.
UK has had gun laws for a long time, and as such, very few people actually have guns, and those that do usually own them legally, guns are hard to obtain. As such, knife crime is very common. Our ban on guns does prevent the 'good guys' from having guns to protect themselves and others with, but on the flip side, in the vast majority of circumstances the criminals don't have guns either, nobody having guns is probably a good thing. That said I do not like the UKs ban on defensive weapons, for example tasers and mace. As I said before knife crime is fairly common here, the criminals have knives, while the average citizen is allowed literally nothing to defend themselves with.
If you tried to implement a similar law in the USA, it wouldn't go so well. Law abiding citizens would be forced to hand in their firearms, while the criminal element would go "Yea...no" and you'd then have a situation where the criminals are armed, and the citizens would have nothing do defend themselves with.
Just my two cents anyway, but I think as usual with big issues the answer lies somewhere in the middle :)

You realize credit cards have fees too right? Given your use case of buying a game on steam (say $20?) and given fees from a typical merchant (Stripe) of 2.9% PLUS 30c per charge...

I'm surprised my bank hasn't flagged me yet, every time I send one of my friends a bank transfer, I send it with a reference of "BUTT PLUGS"
Then, if they call/go in branch, they'll often get asked about recent transactions as a security question.
I'm a terrible friend.

Nah, no resend SMS button. I've been through this particular show before. You get no SMS, you phone them up, they say "Oh ok, we'll allow the payment", you end the call, you try to make the payment again, it fails again, you call them again, they say "Oh sorry, we'll try and resolve the issue and get back to you". Then they never do.
There's no paranoia here, just a desire to be in control of my money and make the payments I want without having to waste hours on the phone.
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:49:16
Just blocked the single transaction - I guess they wanted confirmation but I never did get a text. I've had similar problems and never been able to resolve it over the phone. Eg when I first moved out of my parents and into my own place I ordered some stuff from Ikea, which fair enough was out of character and I could understand the additional scrutiny. I couldn't understand me wasting 30 minutes on the phone, then being told they'd sorted it and the payment would go through, only to try again and have it still be blocked. It's incredibly annoying to have to phone the bank, wait on hold, finally get through to someone, explain it, pass security checks, have them find the transaction, unblock it, and then maybe the transaction will go through next time...screw that.

Haha, I just print random stuff honestly. It's one of those things that you'd never miss until you had one, and then it's revolutionary. I printed some nice grips for my Nintendo Switch most recently. I've also printed parts to repair telescope tripods, parts for a local museum, little pokemon keyrings that we sold for charity, upgrades for the printer of course, loads of mods/parts for my electric scooter, etc etc. Last christmas I designed and printed a [charging dock for my girlfriends pokeball plus]( Pretty cool to be able to say "I made this thing for you, from scratch"
Edit: Decided to include some links to cool things:
[The switch grips](
[Fixed my dishwasher with this]( - Yep my 3d dishwasher is still standing on these 3d printed feet since January.
[Fixed my portable AC](
[Made a coaster that gets people connected to my WiFi with QR/NFC](
Upgraded my scooter to 10 inch tires with [this]( and [this](
Upgraded my scooters brakes with [this](
etc, etc, tl;dr I like printing stuff.
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:47:15
I didn't make it, and I very much doubt that scaling it in your slicer would do the job. There are other grips on thingiverse that are made for the switch lite though

Just arrived to this fun times, I have very little context, but I am a developer myself and reading your comments... yea no.


If the client can send things that endagers pool operation (ie your server), this is a problem with your server software that should be fixed. I hope you're aware, it's not difficult for anyone to send any data to the server that they feel like, regardless of these checks you put into the client. It's down to you as a developer to be sure that your server properly sanitizes and checks all data from the client.


If you rely on this to protect your server infrastructure, you're in for a bad time. Removing files is generally always best avoided and can lead to lots of problems if not done very carefully. Time and time again have developers got this wrong and caused deletion of other files/data. This is why you should always try to avoid removing files where possible.


This reddit post is just that - people don't like it, they are spreading why they don't like it, and they are choosing not to use it. You can either take this feedback, learn from it, and improve the situation, or you can loose a bunch of users and damage your reputation.


I'm seeing that a lot in your responses, you seem to act like your code (and the peoples computers you are running it on) are some sort of game. Delete data from peoples computer, arbitrary code execution, no problem! It's the type of mentality I expect to see from children/teenagers and not a grown adult. This kind of behaviour will only serve to damage your reputation. You should probably sort it out unless this is how you want people to see you.


There is no need to use remote code execution. If you have problems, ask the internet. Code things the right way not the wrong way. This kind of thing can go extremely, horribly wrong. You should disable remote code execution, and any features that require it for the time being. Even if you aren't abusing it yourself, it makes your server a target for attack, and puts your users at risk.

I'm a programmer by trade so I use OpenSCAD for my 3d designs. I used [this library]( to generate the thread. I then used a set of calipers to measure the thread diameter (the width of the bolt), and thread pitch (the space between the screw threads), and I counted the number of windings. I chucked this all into OpenSCAD and added a small foot, and job done. If it helps, here is the OpenSCAD source code for the dishwasher foot:
    use &lt;Threading.scad&gt;
    thread_diameter = 17.5;
    thread_pitch = 4;
    thread_windings = 19;
    foot_height = 10;
    foot_diameter = 30;
    cylinder(d=foot_diameter, h=foot_height);
    translate([0, 0, foot_height]) {
        threading(pitch = thread_pitch, d=thread_diameter, windings = thread_windings, angle = 60, full = true);
        cylinder(d=14.5, h=82);
    }
To render it in OpenSCAD, you will need to download the library I linked above, and place the two .scad files (naca_sweep and threading) into your [OpenSCAD libraries directory]( Then you can fire up OpenSCAD, paste the above code in, and press F5 for a preview. F6 to render and F7 to export as STL.

@_date: 2019-09-22 11:26:35
The problem with this logic is it's fairly faulty, and you're paying a premium for a convenience. If you're exchanging a small amount of money this is fine.
For example, we're currently on $10,000/BTC, one of the posters below mentioned it was around $430 above spot, so $10,430/BTC.
We can also see that the person exchanged 500000 VND, which is $21.50.
If we exchange $21.50 for BTC at spot ($10,000/BTC), you'd get 0.00215 BTC (which is of course worth $21.50 at market)
If we exchange $21.50 for BTC at the ATM ($10,430/BTC), you'd get 0.00206136 BTC (which is worth $20.61 at market)
Is it worth $0.89 to sign up to an exchange, go through KYC, link your bank account, wait days for the whole process to complete? Answer: Probably not. Bitcoin just makes it sound worse than it actually is - paying $700 above spot for USD-&gt;BTC sounds a whole lot worse than paying $0.08 above spot for GBP-&gt;USD, even though they (currently) would result in exactly the same percentage of loss.
The same is true for all high street currency exchange, you pay a percentage above spot for the convenience of doing it easily and quickly. Nobody is going to treat you like a shmuck for exchanging $500 on the high street to go on holiday. The only difference is that 1 BTC is worth $10,000, and 1 GBP is worth $1.25. It's the percentage that matters, and whether that percentage is worth it to you personally for the convenience.

Just to add to this, 2fa via SMS is completely useless. A lot of Bitcoin is regularly stolen by people who social engineer the mobile carriers to get sent a SIM card with your phone number, then use your phone number to reset your passwords and login.

The size of my wallet doesn't "require" me to do anything, I choose to work on Bitcoin because I find it fun and it pays well. I think the problem is you're thinking of BTC as a stock, which it isn't. It's a currency. Most of my expenses are denominated in bitcoin, I buy my groceries in bitcoin (my last shop cost me 0.11 BTC), I go shopping on Amazon, etc. I don't hold very much fiat money now, only enough to pay stuff that you have to pay via direct debit (phone, electric, rent) and I imagine that stuff will change in time.

Bitcoin-OTC op here, figured I should just drop in with some handy safety tips.
tl;dr use ;;getrating before trading and you most likely won't get scammed
When making a trade using OTC, you should ALWAYS check a persons ratings. Use the ;;getrating [ident Nickname] in the channel, for example to check my ratings, you'd use ;;getrating [ident Azelphur]
If they are not authenticated, or they do not have a sufficient rating, you should NOT trade with them, or make them send first.
A few things to watch out for:
People who make excuses to not authenticate (On a different computer, can't be bothered, etc)
Being given a link to the feedback page, always check yourself with ;;getrating (This applies to OPs case)
People who have similar, or even the same nick as reputable traders (Again, always check with ;;getrating to avoid this) (This applies to OPs case)
People who create dummy accounts to give themselves +ratings, you should check that at least some of the ratings come from other high rated traders (You can easily see this on the rating page)
People with few ratings positive ratings can still turn out to be fraudsters
If you want to trade with someone who has low or no reputation, ALWAYS use an escrow. I am happy to escrow for you if you ask me. Anyone who has a problem with a reputable escrow is again most likely a fraudster!
If you have any questions (or if you feel unsafe about a trade) feel free to drop me a message, I'll happily give you my opinion on whether a trade is safe, or try to answer any other questions.
Sorry you got scammed, hope this helps with your future trading.
