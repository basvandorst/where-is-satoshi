I don't see quotations- how many of these quotes have actually come from Buffet?

Don't be mislead dude- even if this was about energy consumption (which is not where my mind is at) that would be a "Crypto Problem" and not a "Bitcoin Problem".  I think anyone who is mining realizes that you either rent the electricity or own it through solar panels.

Could you keep going... so if you minimized by -350x could you take the larger bull run and multiply it by the same magnitude so we can see it on the right?

I see it looks too be a timeline but having bitcoin last would help with making a statement.

 "Among other things, [Bitcoin]( has been criticized for price volatility, use in illegal transactions and thefts from exchanges. It has also proven highly controversial for the sheer amount of energy it requires. The University of Cambridge has released [a new online tool]( that estimates the level of electricity the crypto-currency network uses and compares it with other entities. It estimates that Bitcoin uses 61.76 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricty per year, more than many countries and around 0.28 percent of [worldwide electricity consumption](   
The Czech Republic consumes an estimated 62.34 TWh while Switzerland consumes 58.46 TWh annually by comparison. In fact, if Bitcoin was a country, it would be the 41st most-energy-demanding nation on earth. All of that thirst for electricity comes from the computing power needed for mining, which is a process where machines are connected to the netowrk to verify transactions, which involves puzzle-solving. Some Bitcoin miners have even relocated to places like Iceland to reduce costs as geothermal energy is abundant there while cold Arctic air helps with cooling. "

Or me who heard about bitcoin back in 2012 but decided that 
"it was ridiculous to spend all this money and convert it to internet money that i would never use"
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:03:58
Totally agree!
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:54:37
You think I'm barking up a tree here - I actually think it's great that there is so much commitment and mining towards Bitcoin and nowhere is it referencing utilizing fossil fuels to mine bitcoin- don't get political here, it's not about that.
Take some time to read through the text and links next time.  Everything that you are reading is quoted from Statistica which in turn is referenced from the University of Cambridge.

The other thing that isn't mentioned is the energy required for the other blockchains but still thought it was interesting.  I thought I remember a company having portable solar farming for Bitcoin and owners of the token would own a share of the bitcoins mined.

Stupid bitcoin  .. classic- this will be stories for our kids.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:06:12
Go get out of your basement and be pessimistic elsewhere dude.  If energy consumption was greater than the whole country of China I would be absolutely ecstatic!

No prob, switched to Gemeni with lower fees anyways.

Nice read bud,  here's an upvote.

Might be good to delete this (if real) - If you made a wise move, you'll be targeted.

In 2011 i believe there was one drop around 90%... bitcoin was very very low then though. 
87% percent and over a year... were currently at 70%and half the time... don't be surprised if we stay in a bear market for a bit more... but if you're looking to accumulate the bottom is either here or very near so now is a really good time to add bitcoin, ether, or alt winners.

Sell signal for BRK-A!

My thoughts are that we're not used to seeing prices like this because stocks always split.  Investopedia says on their site that " The primary motive is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though the underlying value of the company has not changed. This has the practical effect of increasing liquidity in the stock." 
Berkshire Hathaway-A has never split, this is essentially an unaffordable stock to most people- so you have to wonder what the share price of all stocks would be if they never split - given the nature of Bitcoin and the ability to buy fractions anyone could buy bitcoin today and you'll never see Bitcoin split.

If bitcoin hits 10k tonight, I'll crush a beer tomorrow morning before work
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:07:49
Have you ever been in contact with someone that had doubts Bitcoin will reach 100K or $500K?
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:43:11
Pretty sure anyone following bitcoin now are long term hodlers. 
I agree with the sentiment to continue to buy specifically NOW.  I think we'll have 1-2 more mania phases with the next quickly approaching. 
Best to have stacks and be well equipped before the party.

Bitcoin passed a couple hundred and i thought shit that's expensive now im never buying bitcoin... FML for generations to come.  All im going to hear is "Grandpa you dipshit!"
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:29:43
This has been happening for a while now.  I think it's the fact that we need /must have ways to pay for goods &amp; services without it being known and not on the books.  This is never something that would be formally spoken, just known.  Not to say I agree with this but think about black budgets, contractors and shady middle east shit we do. 
You think they'll want to have people knowing about this.

I like how you have an exclamation mark in all of your art-  like, get your F% Bitcoin folks!

Why can't we tag fraud accounts and keep following transaction addresses all the way through?
Would we then have a problem with transfer dilution?  what other problems would we have?  I know there has got to be a way to address this.
