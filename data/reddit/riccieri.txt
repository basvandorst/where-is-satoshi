If you are not a developer, watching Github will probably be overwhelming and difficult to filter.
I think that a curated summary of the bigger user-facing changes would be more helpful for those that aren't necessarily technical, but still want to stay informed and have an opinion.
Edit: improve wording

[We Use Coins]( is a very good place to start. They have some introductory material, and many follow up links if you want to get deeper.

Maybe it could be tackled with higher fees? Having the ease of use and speed of credit card processing would certainly attract a lot of people

I've sent them a message through their [contact page]( (I'm a customer) asking if they would consider accepting bitcoins. It would be huge for me, since credit card taxes for international purchases just went up in Brazil.

No, you just have to be a registered user. The number of votes varies though. IIRC, the free users have 6 votes, while the paying users have 9.

I love seeing these charts, as it's clearly a sign that bitcoin is being beneficial for these small businesses and their customers.
That said, I think that a big part of the buyers are on it for the novelty and cult effect of buying something with bitcoins, and because of the free publicity that these businesses are getting from posting on I see it as early adopter gains, much like the early miners gained.
As more and more businesses start to accept bitcoin, maybe the novelty will wear off, and that particular benefit won't be relevant anymore (of course, we still get the smaller taxes, no chargebacks and all that). I would love to be wrong though :)

I haven't seen any charts (maybe [bitcoincharts]( will have some in a few days), but the price is at the bottom of the page.
Currently it says:


In english:

The prices of the things you are buying aren't indexed by the BTC/USD rate? AFAIK, bitpay uses the rate to calculate the price in BTC.
I would be interested to hear about stores that are using bitcoin as their primary currency, instead of pricing in dollars and then converting.

It's not so much about being able to read the pull request. I'm sure that most people are able to read the PR we are discussing in particular, but it might not be true about every PR on bitcoin/bitcoin (I know I can't).
I don't think it is necessary to be able to understand the inner workings of bitcoin-qt to have an opinion on the more user-facing changes. I think those should be more visible to the users, instead of being buried among more lower-level issues.

I think this is true. But I also think that, if/when Dropbox start accepting bitcoin, there'll be plenty of enthusiasts that will pay for their service solely because it is in bitcoin, and that wouldn't do it otherwise.
I think it's a win-win situation, right? Dropbox gets more paying customers, and the enthusiasts get to spread the word about bitcoin (and more storage space!).
