No mention of block halving?

Good point

He seems to be the only one to have reacted this way (deleting Twitter and whatnot). Could be all staged but it could be telling. This is looking very interesting

Also realize this - everyone judging how he behaved in the past is probably looking at it from TODAY'S perspective. He probably had no idea what it would become. While it was genius there were many things along the way that may have doomed it in its infancy but it grew strong enough to survive...The timelock verify coming online is interesting too - he now has the capability to lock the coins for good. I bet if he did lock them it would be a staggered lock.

So use bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-09-30 00:44:02
I just did this. I had bitcoins on my computer in my own wallet in less than 5 minutes. Wow. 
I wonder how they are going to deal with identity theft. If I had a bunch of socials/CC's and just kept opening accounts from a different IP address and buying bitcoin - how would they prevent that?

Imagine how useful this image would have been if it were emailed to you 2 years ago....think Sports Almanac Back to the Future

This is big.... Right? Seems like the alpha dog.... But quantum computers are still the mega dog

Has South Park done an episode on Bitcoin yet? They definitely should. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 00:36:05
It's like the first round of the ncaa tourney.... Lots of teams... Lots of upsets ... Bitcoin madness 
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:50:43
Thanks for the reply...I think you convinced me to buy in at least a little bit. Very exciting things are coming I think. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:17:15
Couldn't they just move their bitcoins to another exchange or even a personal wallet rather than selling? 
@_date: 2014-08-08 06:54:27
I might take a small percentage of my 401k and invest in bitcoin... Talk to her. Get the girl and the coin. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:30:42
So freaking tempting 
@_date: 2015-09-30 00:40:10
oops meant to post this to showerthoughts. lame attempt ++
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:38:18

I know it's not the same but it's still funny 
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:05:00
Congrats on being sarcastic on the Internet 
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:57:38
Recommendations? My coins are in a paper wallet so I don't have to use it. I'll probably use multibit. i thought there was a wallet with features to let me choose which tx's to send (ignoring the dust) 
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:29:09
10/10 would mine again 
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:24:11
Blockchains for everyone!
