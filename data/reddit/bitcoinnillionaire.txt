Hey look how much money I have!

@_date: 2015-12-17 18:13:39
Ahhh that makes sense.  Thanks!  
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:41:04
Nice try
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:32:12
Party on Wayne!

You should be Bitcoin-CHO.
Chief Hodling Officer.

Better to lose 5 or 10% now than 20% to taxes

VCRs are obsolete but we still needed them at one point in time because it was the best thing we had.

I went to two dispensaries of the recreational variety just a couple weeks ago and used debit/credit cards at both.
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:10:15
Yes it would...
@_date: 2014-07-15 10:20:51
That right there is silkroad in a nutshell.  It even works in broad daylight.

The Winklevii are probably hurtin right now
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:02:57
Sounds exactly like what humans do every day.
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:18:11
Why would you buy above market, only to dump it on the open market at a loss?  That's stupid.

Yep.  Texas wiretap/conversation recording laws are only one party.
Sue the shit out of them.
@_date: 2015-05-02 08:35:55
If you're buying it for the status symbol you buy a brand new one and let it sit in the garage.
If you're a moderately but not obscenely wealthy car enthusiast that plans to actually drive it, you buy a used one.

I wish they would lend me money at a negative interest rate :(
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:52:19
Yeah that one dollar, TOTALLY saving me some cashola with the ever abysmal exchange rate
@_date: 2015-04-29 05:26:41
I'm genuinely curious how paying someone to lend them money is profitable in any way?

I was so close to going to school at McGill, Montreal is such an awesome place.

I love bitcoin, but jesus H christ I am not going to buy a gift card online so that I can go to gamestop and exchange one gift card for the other just to go to the shell station.
@_date: 2016-05-02 03:14:05
Refuse to acknowledge good suggestion?  You're irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:51:40
It's nitpicking :P
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:10:43
Indeed I couldn't resist.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:59:56
Nice try, LE!

As much as I too dislike banks, it really irks me how Bitcoiners feel the need to sling mud every chance they get on the subject.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:44:54
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:34:01
I'd bet there are just as many (small businesses) that were thinking they would run narrow margins to get some sales and then take their profits on the ever increasing value of those coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:38:11
I wonder how many of them clicked the "yes I understand market price at time of delivery" when they have days they max out their available buys.

I'm still waiting on gas prices to crash before I fill up my gas tank.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:25:58
If my next limit order gets filled I will have come out of this with 20% more BTC than I had this morning.
I'll take my chances.  It's already been to 266 once, it can get there again in a more reasonable fashion.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:35:52
I bought a little at 1080.  Bought a little more than that amount of BTC at 645 amounted today I'm pretty much even and expect it to go further up.
Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.

Dark please.  I registered bitcoinnillionaire there too!
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:01:41
Some are larger/smaller than others too which makes it more challenging.  Lots of touring and cruiser bikes have bags and locking trunks, whereas my crotch rocket has enough room under the rear seat for a phone and a wallet and that's about it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:28:38
Not really.  I'm buying in like .1 and .2 BTC amounts.  Hardly big money, and I've been watching this so closely over the last year I've gotten a good feel for the market.
If only I could pick stocks as well as this!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:36:35
I slightly downsized my position and was ready for a serious crash and then this shit.  Still way in the green from getting lucky at 500.  Can't win em all.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:21:44
You're going to lose it either way in the name of keeping yourself alive.

I don't necessarily trust the quality of work of someone that confuses of and have.

"I sold my spare coins as presents for a dollar each.  Massive losses.  Sorry IRS."
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:48:14
The USD is used for more drug trade than BTC is.

I wish I could give others my debt.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:42:28
I accidentally placed a sell order I didn't want to well above market price and it refuses to cancel it.
So I just withdrew my coins to an outside wallet haha.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:28:51
Thank you
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:58:22
Unless the hole is more profitable than the reward.
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:15:51
Scarcity is hardly the issue. 
Bitcoin has a functional use beyond aesthetics.
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:17:28
Are you high?  Some people have more things to do in life than bake desserts all day every day.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:34:38
Hey guys I live on Mars why is it so hard to buy Bitcoin.
It's like you people have never had to take the time to sign up for a bank account and wait a few days for the debit card to arrive in the mail.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:49:18
Can use credit/debit cards, but unfortunately they have deposit limits that would make 10BTC difficult to obtain in a timely manner.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:51:08
Yeah it can take quite a while, especially if you don't have blazingly fast internets.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:23:17
You lose out even more if you never buy the BTC and only spend USD.  It goes both ways.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:33:43
Not many of the big ones though.
I paid for a $15 month of Metart just for shits and giggles because I knew I wouldn't have to fuck with the instant renewal unable to cancel drain my bank BS.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:33:59
You should work on your presentation a little more then.
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:26:46
My crystal ball predicts another strong surge upwards if we can keep from dipping down below 1k USD/BTC here.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:15:12
Yeah I was legitimately freaking out.  
I have moved my coins (not very many) to a higher fee but smaller exchange in hopes that I can increase my bitcoin holdings on future tumbles.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:39:16
Got that big money son!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:16:44
Anyone else think that ddos attacks like this are only going to strengthen bitcoin in the long run?  If it can withstand this kind of an earthquake it bodes well for the future.
Other than the assholes doing the attacks who are cleaning up buying em cheap.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:34:29
So I just registered for bitcointalk to bid but it won't let new users post there?
Any other way I can bid?  I imagine I will certainly be outbid but was going to start at .15 (not .015).  Baklava for charity makes me happy.
