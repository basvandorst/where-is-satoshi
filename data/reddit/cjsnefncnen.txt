So basically, don't transact on Bitcoin blockchain right now fellas. 
This is just another one of those days - transfer of wealth event. 
From weak hands to the sharks.

:( peace and loveee~ we all have made a shitton of money this year regardless as long as you've been HODLing a month+ 
Just don't look at it today:)
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:36:30
Yes FUDmachine in full force today. 
Just sit back and HODL too many not selling for price to drop too much. 
BCASH is just capitalizing on transaction fees cause that is only thing going for it over Bitcoin. Ver is laughing on his camelskin ferrari couch right about now.

50%? That is less likely than this being a dip. But sure I'll buy your Bitcoin on gdax
Yes it is instant if you transfer from coinbase to gdax and it will be bought immediately. Or just use sell tab on coinbase

The whole point of blockchain is decentralization, not speed and centralization.
