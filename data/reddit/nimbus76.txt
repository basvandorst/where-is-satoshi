Well, I love me some Bitcoin, but bubble crashes can destruct a lot of value too. Let's hope nothing like that happens anytime soon.

I don't see it as being any different than knowing your password to your bank account and crossing the border. Surely you don't have to declare the password to your bank account.

Calls every other coin on the planet a shitcoin. Prefers a coin where $23 transaction fees may be required and/or wait times of more than an hour to process.
