First your like.. Sounds like a really stupid idea, but they you find out they have a token so you understand why someone bothers. So they can get rich off you.. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:20:41
100% money grab scam
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:48:34
Yes you can. This really can't be news to you? 
The list is soooo long
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:44:15
They said before that no fiat were lost in the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-19 10:59:37
No. It was fun
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:27:25
Where is pos prospering?
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:14:07
No worries, that scam will die long before they ever have to worry about 20t/s for anything besides testing, and way way way before they have 20t/s bitcoin will have scaled far beyond that.
But yes, at the moment bitcoin handles less txs because it has to work, eth doens't need to worry about stuff like working and being useful, so then it's much easier. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:55:51
So smart! They should just put you in charge!
WHY NOT JUST PUT MAX BLOCK SIZE = 200MB?! THAT's 100 TIMES BETTER EVEN!! lol supuid blocxstream == NSA. the sheeple is so blind lolinfowars! 
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:53:16
hacking, drugs and thefts keep it interresing. Charity.. so bland
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:45:09
Understand that bitcoin has by far the best scaling of ANY coin. You think an altcoin has solved scaling? Get real.

I'm sure your expertise is welcome if you have a way to speed up the process. 
Any ideas?

Your right! THEY ARE GIVING THE PUBLIC A CHANCE TO GET RICH. HOW NICE OF THEM!! THEY ARE GETTING CRITICAL MASS!! They basicly want to GIVE you money. 
we should all invest right away. Maybe we can get a package with shares in mt.gox? Buy while it's low right?

Do you think about adding other scams that help you? Would you have added paycoin?
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:06:38
Show me one coin that does. They all have way less transactions.
I'll just put a max_blocksize_whatever=1000000gb, oh my coin can now handle sooo many transctions. Wow! But naah, that's not how it works. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:05:53
You must have done a lot of great science to come up with that great 2mb number. Not like the idiot core devs. They are just stalling to DESTROY BITCOIN!

Well done! Pretty funny
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:23:37
Sounds like it could be a fun interview @_date: 2016-08-10 11:28:29
Lol, no it didn't. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:50:03
Or maybe, just MAYBE, they have had other concerns, like not risking the security of the network, not risking decentralisation, not risking dangerous hardforks just so ppl can try about paying a few less cents on a transcation, much to the sadness of the 17 year old wannabe pump-n-dumber get rich quick kid who think they are owed 1000x ROI by the universe.
It's not like they know what they are doing or something. Listen up everyone, the 16 year old investors have done all the computer science already! WHY DOESNT SOMEONE LISTEN TO ALL THEIR GREAT IDEAS AND FORK ALREADY LULZ! Must be a conspiracy to DESTROY BITCOIN! lol gregonomics federal reservecoin infowars done the math
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:18:40
No, still SCALES better than any other coin. None of them can handle that kind of throughput and still be decentralised. Show me evidence to the contrary.
No other coin comes close. Puting a higher max is not the same as scaling to that volume.
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:32:02
So from here it can only go up or down!
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:08:47
Yes, you kind of did say that. You said you were worried he'd go to another coin, but he can't. Because no one has solved the scaling to that kind of transaction volume, so how could he move elsewhere.
He can't, and core is working on it. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 00:22:58
Because blockchain offers zero efficency. No one needs a block chain for land registry. But ofc they would have you believe that to sell a stupid token that's even less needed. 
And some additional arguments was sent to me from another user that i will include:
no available code base
no publicly released signed statements of partnerships
the demos are very strange for instance land registration is literally a google form: 
there is no current use of blockchain in any demo.

Obviously they can't agree to that, it would kill XT.
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:44:48
Unless you are Gavin there is no way you would know how he'd act in that situation (and probably not even if you were Gavin, as we are not that well known to ourselves), so don't pretend like that's an objective reality.
And there is no such thing as an objective way that is the best and once that is shown, everyone goes that way. Every chance has a benefit and a cost, and people don't agree on what benefits are worth what costs, therefore Gavin and the other core devs will not have a single "best plan", because they don't agree 100% on the premise.

Yes. The value of Bitcoin has risen so fast that it's been a little hard to keep up with the units. Don't worry too much about it.

I didn't mean to be angry or incite confiict but I wanted to point out that what would seem to be cause for revolt reallt isn't because people are too busy minding their own business and the whole system is designed to come out with the same winner regardless of how the round is played.
Sure, people have fought, and do fight, fractional reserve banking. I think you might be familiar with people such as Ron Paul, who rasied his voice against this and of course, there has been many like him in the past.

When the debt and liabilites made slaves of coming generations? When it sent its young to die overseas for bankers? When inflation taxed your savings and gave it to the rich? When your goverment tracks every step you take? When it bailed out the banks with you money?
After all this, you think the slaves would revolt such a detail, when they don't even own their own bodies?
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:43:01

Yeah, focus on MtGox. The Silkroad "crime syndicate" and that the price for a few weeks was 1200$. Show your agenda right away.
And ooh no, we are years away from having a digital currency that is used world wide and comparable to the global reserve currency that is enforced by the largest army in the world. Imagine that? And this is five years in.
The real advantage of bitcoin is having a currency free of political influence. Try starting a war when you can't print money. I'm not investing in BTC. I'm opting out of the fiat currency scam.

Yes of course they want regulations to be clear. They want to play the game, beacuse it has served them in the past. Fine. If they want that, let the play, but don't force others to do the same.
If you don't want regulations you should be free to interact with other people who want the same.

I love Alan Watts do death. Heard everyone of his available talks and read some of his books, but he is just dead wrong on most of his economics.
Yes, economics is a game, but you can not fake neither the trust nor the price. But that is why bitcoin is so great. No trust needed, all the checks and balances evens out because of math.

Victim blaming. Very classy.
I hope you apply the same logic when you walk in to an unfamiliar neighborhood and get robbed or get your house broken into. Should have known/taken better precautions. And also, if it weren't for those people who don't know how to write a hello world program, your bitcoins would be worth less than 10$ still.

You are confusing counterparty risk with legal right. 
If you keep a bike at your friends house he might sell it, lose it or his house might burn down but you still have right to your bike and he may be taken to court. 
If you deposit your bike do your bank, the same rules doesn't apply. They may not be taken to court for losing "your" bike in the same way.
Mtgox is probably more like your friends house than the bank
@_date: 2014-11-01 11:30:11
Having the option isn't bad.
Why wouldn't a person who isn't very versed in security want a company to secure thier all, or a portion of their coins for them and still getting the benefits of being invested in bitcoins.
More options is always good. The market decides
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:57:19
Anyone following the evolution of BTC from 2012 would understand that a specualative bubble is not the same as BTC being in a "death spiral".

Wrong, unless you are a nihilist that says might makes right and democracy should rule. But then again, no so called democrats really are, since they start crying as soon as people vote for the fascists or child molester. 
Morals are independet of government and the very idea of a government is sick and repulsive to anyone who believes in self ownership and property rights and are opposed to slavery.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:46:26
No, that only means your money will be stolen from innocent people to pay for the crime of the thief. 
It also promotes and encourages risky behaviour among banks because they can privatize the earings and socialise the risk, and it also encourages irrisposiblen behaviors from the costumers, as it frees them from risking their own money when they choose a bank.

"In developing this regulatory framework, we have sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity – without stifling beneficial innovation"
Whatever you did, it has nothing do with that
"These regulations include provisions to help safeguard customer assets, protect against cyber hacking, and prevent the abuse of virtual currencies for illegal activity, such as money laundering."
No it doesn't
"e recognize that not everyone in the virtual currency community will be pleased about the prospect of a new regulatory framework. Ultimately, though, we believe that setting up common sense rules of the road is vital to the long-term future of the virtual currency industry, as well as the safety and soundness of customer assets."
No thanks. We did good without you
"As the first state to put forward specially tailored rules for virtual currency firms – continued public feedback will be an important part of finalizing this regulatory framework. We look forward to carefully and thoughtfully reviewing public comments on our proposal."

Loool @ "distributed" ledgers comment. So, they are like drop box right? Except immutable? But how are they immutable? Because PoW. But you want permissioned ledgers without PoW? So, now we are back to drop box.
Blockchains solve one problem, and only one, trust. No need for that when you have permission to only let TRUSTED parties in.
She bought the hype and now stands clueless looking for a problem to solve. 
Also... like she knows anything about databases at all. She's a fucking banker.

Lol, if you hope investments will come because people play nice in the community then you are going to have a bad time.
You don't want people to invest because they want to, but because they have to. And the only way do to that is to build tech that works for that purpose. And that is not a matter or public opinion because 99% here doesnt.'t even know what a blockchain is good for

@_date: 2016-01-15 07:56:23
Yes, because the ONLY upside blockchains offer as opposed to other database technology is removing trust. See, if you don't get this, you don't know what a blockchain does.
See it doesn't matter how much banking you ever done. Blythe Masters and her peers still don't know what a blockchain is. Read her posts and tell me that she does.
And what do they do? They take the trustlessness out of the blockchain and still say it does some new. It doesn't. And until you figure this out, you are of the kids looking at the emperor and saying he's got a nice suit. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:22:44
Adam Back, the creator of Hashcash and a world renowned expert on the subject has a FLAWED VIEW on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-01-13 22:14:20
Alright, listen to the whole thing. Some good points, some not so good. On my phone so I have to keep it short
BTC mainly used for criminal intent. Well, yes, btc is regulatory arbitrage as a term some clever guys coined. It's used to service all underserviced markets and that includes the criminal one. 
This is just as moral or immoral as the law. Where drugs are illegal it will used for drugs. Where capital control is in place it will be used for get around that e.t.c
Then he argues against it being used in places where the monetary policy is bad because you can already smuggle dollar bills there. Not a good argument in my mind, there is plenty good reasons to have electronic currency and btc may service that market. It also relies on a particular country having a good monetary policy and gives you an alternative to increasing monatary bases.
Then he talks about designflaws in the network because you can spam it, but I don't think he understands the economics behind it and vastly overstates the problem. And even now some of the things he talks about are being solved with segwit.
Still, much better skepticism than you get from run of the mill naysayers. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 04:46:57
No, darknet markets for sure 
@_date: 2016-01-14 15:14:55
It will just limit the amount of time users keep btc on the site I think and increase the amount of sites and thus limit the exposure to users. 
Indeed it seems like that is exactly what happend and the dark web seems as alive as it has ever been.

They run a million dollar a day operation that depend on their bitcoin knowledge. They were probably long since familiar with luke-jr and his stance on mining so I very much doubt this had anything to do with it.
If I could, I'd bet that they never planned on supporting Classic in the first place. Just testing the waters. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:55:05
Lol, the is a zero use for that. You think every user selling their second hand shit wants to put up their own store front for a used sofa? 
There is already perfectly good marketplaces for selling second hand shit that goes well beyond the extremly tiny market OB is targeting. The usecase is darknet markets, and well see if OB can serve them better than the ones who exist now. I doubt it
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:42:29
I hear you, everyone is looking for that golden ticket but it's not only that.
Thing is, this community is constantly under attack from all fucking sides. When it's not from the media it's from within, every other site has been a scam, and then you have every altcoin snakeoil salesman trying to spread FUD about every little detail and that confuses all the noobs.
Then you people going for hardforks and sterring up more shit. So I don't blame people for getting a little on the defensive side, you are bound to. Especially when you are new to the game and everyone is saying different shit.
We don't need to big conspiracy to say that some companies want to spread to FUD about bitcoin in order to better sell your product, and if you can get piece in the NYT from a former dev, even better. They knew about that piece, that's for sure. They said so themselves in the video posted here. Mike hade his statements very clear a long time ago and now he takes them to the NYT like a little bitch because he didn't get his precious fork. I mean, no one can be sure that's why he did what he did, but it's not unreasonable to assume that's a possibility. Probably worth a few $ too if you where to place a short.
@_date: 2016-01-11 11:59:44

@_date: 2016-01-18 22:18:29
Every transaction worth a damn (done for other than political reasons, where you just as well could have used CC), is done because of censorship resistance in the network.
If BTC is going to keep winning it's not from the users who want to use it. Hell, you are probably insane if you want to at the moment, it's from the people who have to use it because of the only thing that makes bitcoin better than other money. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:23:55
That's probably the only real feature of bitcoin, and it's a very important one.
It's censorship resistance due to decentralization or nothing. All this competing with Visa bullshit is so stupid it hurts my brain even to think about it.
Credit cards are great. When the fuck did your visa not work the last time? They are fucking amazing. Never once did I have a problem with them.
Fine, if you want that, that will also come with lightning network or some other solution, but risking the whole network so you can store your purchase of bubblegum on 10.000 copies of the same database. Damn.. that makes me wonder if these people really know what a blockchain is good for or if they bought the hype like the bankers.

Everyone "knows" they vote for the good and sustainable changes. Yet they don't because there is no way they can know that.
They don't know how the laws will be written and interpreted by the lawyers and courts, nor have they any idea what unintended consequences the laws will have.
The mere act of saying you vote for good things, because that is how they sound out of the mouths of those who depend on your vote for power is... questionable.
And you sure could argue the morality of laws at the first place.
No one can vote for the "good" slave owner because there is no such thing as a good one.

That's not a solution for people who think fiat currency controlled by politics is a problem. That's a solution to what you think is the problem with the current fiscal policy at a particular place  (probably the US) and how you think that should change.
I'm fine with letting government money compete with private money. Make them equal and let humanity play it out. Like with everything else, the most successful wins. If people like your/USD/yen money better they will use that, if not, they can use Bitcoin, gold or whatever next is found out to be the preferred.
If you think the monetary policy of a few central bankers beat that of bitcoin, use it.

@_date: 2015-11-16 18:48:57
Of course it can, and will, scale. It just that something that you have to ponder back and forth until you are forced to decide on something. It's not a problem. It's just how humans decide. They gather as much information as possible until they have to decide. 
The same as with every problem in the world, they are not addressed until it's too costly to not act.
That's one of the greatest features of bitcoin. It gets attacked from all angles at the same time, and we easily see where the problem lies as it's an opt in, community driven money and act accordingly.
Honestly, at the private "blockchains", it's as big LOL. They offer NOTHING about what makes bitcoin great. That's why they can scale "free of cost" (by that, I mean, give all your trust to the banks, no way they would betray that one again right?). They don't have the volatility (well, obviously they do, because every currency is volatile, but lets ignore that fact), because they are forced upon nations. Bitcoin was created for the SOLE REASON to able to CIRCUMVENT that, and now you think the real disruption is that banks can talk a little easier on their database. WOW...
Yeah, everyone is really sticking their heads in the sand because you thought the first international currency, that's permission less, free for anyone to use and whose whole history can be downloaded to a normal desktop computer even in the 3rd world didn't scale to 6 billion users in its first fucking years of its existence.

Yes, it's possible to coerce in a market, as people can try to get the best out of each other using immoral means, but that has nothing to do with markets themselves.

I agree with most of what you say except that it's immoral by default to evade laws. To follow that logic you have to apply it to all laws everywhere. Are you willing to do that? Of course not. No one is.

Society is just an arbitrary group of people who happend to be born under invisible geographical lines, often drawn because of some war a few hundred years back. If the consenus temporary political group who happens to rule that area for the time being is the basis for morality then you'd have to accept any law ever as moral and any tools to avoid immoral. Sorry Jews trying to escape naziland, forgery of your papers are illegal and the laws says you must go to camp.
The DNMs are not one entity. They are an industy just as any and their motives are diverse such as in any field.
Some have had clearly stated moral/political goals, others are amoral and in it for profit, others have been scams. But just as in any field it's nor about that. If a medical companydevelops a product just for profit, that still makes it a moral cause even if it is not done for moral reasons. Same with DNM. They may or may not have a moral cause, but they still serve the moral cause of helping to fight immoral laws. Even if they do it by accident.

@_date: 2015-10-25 16:52:13
That's not ideal at all. That would mean that the token value is limited to a token of trade than a complete transfer of value and gives less opportunities.
Of course people are going to use their accumlated value and knowledge to gain more value and knowledge. That's a feature not a flaw.
To say that money is broken because it offers possibilites other than direct trade is the equivalent of saying that poker is broken because it usually transfer knowledge to the good players.
I do agree that most of the fiat systems are broken, but that is because they are exploitable due to monetary policy. This is not a absolute feature of the abstraction we call money.
@_date: 2015-10-25 08:15:36
Explain how money is a problem. It is widely recoginzed that money has been one of, if not the most, important invention humans ever invented.
Money is a human abstraction to communicate value. Since value is subjective, the best form of money is the one with least inherant properties but still fulfills the requierments for being money.

I don't believe this for a second. A lot of them like Bitcoin?
Can you show a few pro-bitcoin posts in to show that they DO in fact like Bitcoin.
They mock everyone who puts money in it, laugh at those who loose money and have a general "bitcoin is useless and the people who use it are neckberd basement dwellers" attitude. These people actually like Bitcoin? Why? What do they like about it? That's right. They are trolls who want to abuse others to keep them in line with their, already established attitudes. Now, these may be right, or they may be wrong, but they sure aren't people who like bitcoin.
Bitcoins use case? It has all the things people use it for. Some tip, others dislike fiat, some people use it for black markets. 
But then again, you are another "concerned troll", who in the "help of bitcoin" just wants to point out that nothing about bitcoin is good and anyone who posts here are in it for the echo-chamber. And that's of course what the concered trolls have been saying all along for years, and will keep saying until, for no reason or another Bitcoin is not a thing you talk about. The demographic and use cases of bitcoin is broader than it has ever been and yet, ofc, it's just an "echo chamber".

2) You don't want it because this exchange. Ok, I understand that it sucks but 180BTC isn't really chump change.

@_date: 2015-10-23 15:08:49
No idea if you can find a resource for it, but BTC-scam are not really different from other scam. They all rely on the same methods. Ignorance and gullibility of the user. Exploiting weaknesses we have. 
Maybe you have gotten emotionally attached to something, or you have a love for money that get the better of your thinking.
Neo&amp;Bee was quite early in my BTC-life. They whole thing sounded good and legit and I really wanted to be a part of a groundbreaking BTC company. They ran ads on Cyprus TV and had a proper team. More knowledgeable players than I said they had a flawed business model, but I didn't think so because I didn't apply enough critical thinking. 
They second one was a trade scam. A friendly user on a chat wanted to sell an amazon gift card. He sent the card first and it looked legit so I didn't want to seem like I was stalling and sent the funds right away. Needless to say, it was a fake.
I am/was quite gullible and tend to think the best of people.

And no, it's not easy to pay someone to make an infinite money making machine. That idea is beyond laughable.
And your whole notion of money as only used only for transfer of goods would for example destroy prediction markets, scientificly proven to be the best predictors of the future, heding markets for farmers e.tc.

For the same reason that gold, food, oil, energy whatever that can be stored might be in higher demand doens't make it a bad investment, if your goal is to make money and you know what you are doing.
