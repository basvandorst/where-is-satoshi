World Com actually had a lot of assets.  Bitcoin has nothing.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:13:25
The problem is the block chain technology is going to leave bitcoin behind. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:26:47
What I don't get is if you think Bitcoin is a valuable currency why do you care what the exchange rate is against the dollar?  I don't wake up every morning and say oh crap the Dollar is down against the Euro.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:52:41
Problem there is no shortage of crypto currencies.  Anyone can make a new one. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:01:07
There are 21 million bitcoins with no intrinsic value.  That is plenty.  How much is a VCR worth? They don't make any more of those. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:21:00
That is why you don't leave long term savings in cash.  Buy stocks, bonds, CDs.  If the Dollar didn't go down in value people wouldn't invest in anything.  It is good that it goes down.  As long as it is a slow decline that is.  If it is going down 20 percent a year you will have problems.  But 2 to 3 percent decline is optimal.

[Pets.com]( went out of business dude.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:18:32
Invest in stocks or buy another governments bonds.  I am not sure how bitcoin going to zero is going to help you anymore than your native currency.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:25:44
Well the nice thing is it can't go below zero. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:23:11
Once it goes to zero it isn't coming back.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:55:40
Funny none of the stores I shop at take bitcoin.  Ad if they did they would have to adjust their prices hourly. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:30:15
Bitcoin is obviously not a good store of value. It was only up because people manipulated it. Now that people have lost money on it there will never be 19k value again. It will hit zero.  The question is not if but when.   Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  And isn't a very good technology. It can't handle high volumes of use.  It has no use case where it can be successful.
  
The dollar at least is required by US businesses to accept as payment.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:32:27
Look at a bitcoin chart for the last 6 months.  It has no purpose or value.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:18:30


But stocks and real estate have value. You can get dividend payments from well run companies and you live on real estate or rent it out.  No purpose to bitcoin other than speculation. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:53:19
Well I have been telling people to get out since it was 19k.   I am not sure why opinion is worthless. My opinion is Bitcoin will go to zero.  That is why I own none. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:44:28
I went to Guadeloupe last year and a Euro was worth 1.07 Dollars. Went to Ireland a year later and it was 1.23 dollars.  That is around a 15 percent change.  I don't check it daily as it not important to me unless I am traveling to places that use the Euro.  
The reason bitcoin is so volatile is people aren't using it as a currency and it has no intrinsic value.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:12:09
I think you are correct. It is easy to get rich over 30 year period.  Very hard to get rich quickly if you are playing by the rules.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:57:35
Even if it went to 25 dollars though you would say it is coming back.  We just hit bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:50:47


Ok will do. But I am guessing if it is zero you won't be around for me to gloat about my results.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:19:41


Yeah but banks will replace that with their own system.  So there is no future in that either. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:27:01
Well that just proves bitcoin isn't a currency and isn't a value store.  It is just some numbers and has less intrinsic value than this post. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:53:40
How are they stealing my money? It is their money.  I don't keep my money in cash.  It has value the moment they give it to me.  I either buy something with it or invest in stocks or short term bonds. 
If you invest in a great company if the value of the dollar goes down they just raise their prices.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:48:10
It isn't supposed to be an everyday currency?  When did that come out? After it failed as an everyday currency and people need a new fantasy story to keep them from losing their fantasy about being rich.  
Yeah I don't think most people speculating on bitcoin have any idea how it works. And why it is a failed technology. Even if you believed in crypto currencies obviously bitcoin is a failure.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:24:29
How does believing in blockchain have anything to do with bitcoin.  It is like saying you should have invested in [pets.com]( if you believed in the Internet. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:04:28


Of course I pay taxes..  I am not sure what your point is.  If you make money off of bitcoin by law you need to pay taxes on it.   Perhaps take a few economics courses before discussing taxes and the value of money. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:09:26
And you can't lose more than 100 percent.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:33:21
This reminds me of when my ex worked for World Com and her co-workers had only World Com stock in their 401ks. I tried hard to get her to convince them to sell at many price points.  They kept saying I have already lost 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 percent what else do I have to lose.  Well all your money. 
  
The most ridiculous thing about this post was Bitcoin was supposed to be a currency. Spend on something.  Everyone buying hoping that they will get rich one day is the reason it will be worthless.   Mom and Pop investors will never come back.  All my co-workers who I tried to talk out of buying bitcoin have sold at great losses and don't have any desire to talk about it anymore. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:59:12
It was meant to be a currency. It doesn't work as a currency.  If you knew it was not usable as a currency than it has no purpose and no value.  Perhaps another crypto-currency will be successful in the future but bitcoin certainly won't be it. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:14:43
Same number as the number of bitcoins I own.
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:28:17






A store of value that lost 68 percent of its value vs the US dollar in 7 months?  And the Dollar has lost value too.  So just think all the value Bitcoin lost.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:34:26
It has.  But that has little effect on me. Other than when I travel to the Europe.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:37:55
So when Bitcoin goes to zero you can buy an infinite amount with your paycheck. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:15:03
When it is 39 cents will you be cool with it?
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:44:02
What is the difference between paying 6300 and 6700 for something that has no value? If you think bitcoin has a future 6700 is a fine price. If you think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme than even 1 cent is too much to pay. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:11:44
On what day will it hit $100?
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:42:27
0 is the bottom.  The only question is when it hits the bottom.
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:34:51
You buy $10k worth of bitcoins. It doesn't matter what price you pay as both will lose $10k. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:34:54
If it goes to zero you will lose just as much as the people who bought in December.  
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:56:59
But I guess when it does go to zero it won't affect me at all.  You on the other hand will be quite sad.  I don't understand your Universe comment.  We all live on Earth.  On Earth bitcoin will go to zero.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:09:15
If you really believed in bitcoin you wouldn't care about what it was worth in dollars. I don't check the value of my dollars against the Euro every day.
