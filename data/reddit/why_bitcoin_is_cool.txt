Cool. You know, I was thinking that the small 'full moon' symbol on each month could have some kind of small clean bitcoin moon symbol. Your pixel-level art might be a good fit for that. Maybe for other small symbols that would go in the days, too, like holiday markers.

- Realistically, Snowden and Julian are still alive and relatively free. They just have different limits on their travel plans than most of us. Do you think Julian and Snowden are primarily sad they can't openly travel in certain places, or primaily proud that they have fundamentally trumped The System--and are still living in relative freedom? They have, to some degree, *reliably escaped*. They're definitely better off than the third world today, or anywhere a few decades ago.
- We used to live in a world that actually *built and installed the FED*. We are now part of one who is questioning it and would *at least* have a harder time, politically, building it today. We are now part of a world that holds a *currency that they cannot touch*. bro this is my namesake dawg
- I, for one, know my own monetary policy, and I don't care about any government, even if it's the one I'm living it at the time. If you have a few passports, plausible deniability, and enough $ or btc for a plane ticket, and if you live in the 1st world, *the laws just aren't fast enough for you*. I will never again lose the ability to pay a man with a gun. The world can fuck itself silly if we can learn to thrive in the violent birth of the future.
I, for one, don't need to move. I have a plan to thrive, and it's not about to be taken away from me. I know cynicism is popular around here. People always find ways to call others lazy and imply that inaction is a sin when compared to obligations to Fight whatever they say The Good Fight is.
I've already moved where I want to move, and your or my government can illegalize eating for all I give a fuck. I'm not going to starve, that's for sure, and I bet you won't either.
I could be some Big Name that has his own "countries to avoid" list, yet I can still log on to Reddit through Tor and [run a fucking art contest]( if I [damn well feel like it]( Why would I move when I am *safely living in a brilliant future?*
I don't need to move. I'm fine where I'm at. Shrimps are stupid anyway, and have no business telling other shrimps that they're absolutely sure they're all gonna die if they don't move. The water is far from boiling where I'm at.

In a case where medical advice and products are free, it could still offer an alternative to what is a very entrenched, monopolist market. For example, while anyone in the Western world can pay for a Western doctor (or even get the service for free), this tool might allow anyone in the whole world to pay for any kind of doctor he wants.
Western doctors pretty reliably give you pills. For some, having another option could be a life-changing boon.

All existing, function darknet markets are centralized. That doesn't necessarily mean the government (or anyone) can find it and take it down.
*If* the server is found through some misstep of the admins, *then* it can be taken down; in this case, centralized networks have a benefit. But some sites--like Agora--can exist (at least for some time) in a functional way while operating outside the reach of any attackers.

I don't know if it actually needs to be decentralized. I know decentralized systems are very pure, but I also know that we've seen like 20 successful centralized drug markets, and 0 successful decentralized ones.
The new, exciting idea here is the medical aspect of it, I think. The fastest way to see if it works is to make a minimum viable product, and that's a million times easier if it's built it very similarly to existing, functional models (save for the changes it *needs*). We need a prototype model T, not a streamlined ferrari.
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:42:33
This is known as a sybil attack. Other dark markets have solved this problem enough for the markets to be functional, so I think we can solve it again for a similar kind of platform with a different kind of market.

The specific fields were examples. Use your imagination a little bit. 
Let's say my knee hurts, and has been for months. I start searching for a doctor to get medical advice from. Will I choose the doctor who has good reviews in mental therapy, or physical therapy?

For an established doctor, there may not be much of an incentive to work within this new market. However, I can see a huge potential in the pool of medical students who have some amount of knowledge or experience, without the degree. Similarly, it's pretty conceivable that users who can't afford phd doctors would be willing to pay less for an "amateur" opinion.
@_date: 2015-04-12 07:20:17
I think this system could work. The key would be for the community to assign an appropriate amount of skepticism to "untested" accounts.
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:27:16
Open Bazaar doesn't necessarily seem interested in directly outmaneuvering litigation, which I feel would need to be a big focus of this project.
However, forking a good dark market server model would definitely be the way to go. You'd want to tweak the reputation system a little I think, and make paying for advice a little more seamless, to start.
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:34:01


Does there need to be a consideration for what's legal? Meth's not legal, but you can buy it on Agora. This system would operate outside of litigation and government, just as existing dark markets do. The point is that the nationality of the doctor and patient simply don't matter, because each is beyond the reach of anyone trying to identify or threaten them.
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:54:40
As I said elsewhere, this is a problem that many existing dark nets have managed to solve for drug vendors (a market potentially just as dangerous, if not moreso). I don't claim to know the particulars, but it seems that we can solve this problem, given the right platform.

Bootstrapping a community of trusted doctors definitely strikes me as possibly the largest hurdle with this idea.
I think adding a market where vendors and clients can actually transact in *medication* could help with this. Even just in migration from existing dark markets with good reputation, selling (for example) medical marijuana. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:43:35
An intelligent user looking for neurology advice would see the positive reputation is centered around ophthalmology, and look for another doctor with more relevant positive reputation.
Having said that, I think having a category system in place for different fields is a definite "must" feature.

All very good questions. Thank you. 20 mbtc


I don't know about the marketplace size. But as an example, I have a friend who would like to get a [fecal transplant]( to cure his [ulcerative colitis]( However, because the medical system is slow to take up new remedies, he can't yet get a single transplant in the entire state. If he could buy [fecal transplant pills]( from a doctor who had a reputation of users who've been cured, he would pay almost any price he could afford.
I don't know if the market would be big, but I think the market would definitely exist to *some* degree, because people with life-changing conditions will pay a high price for a possible solution. Operation and setup costs of a server aren't too crazy these days, and a small market could easily be enough to fuel it financially.
EDIT: missed the "per geographical region" qualifier:
The market wouldn't be limited by geographical region, so much as shipping capabilities. Intra-national shipping avoids most customs, as I understand it. This strikes me as a large enough field.


I think leaving it as general as "health advice/remedies" of any type would be fine. You could use categories to narrow interest down, like existing dark markets use for weapons/drugs/info/etc.


This is true about dark markets, and yet they remain effective enough at preventing/diverting this that they are effective and useful. I don't claim to know the particulars, but it seems to be a problem that many people have solved already, and which we can solve again.


Client contacts doctor, requests advice/product -&gt; doctor delivers advice/product -&gt; client leaves negative review. What can the doctor do at this point? The customer has probably already chosen another doctor for further transactions anyway. If the new doctor sees the client as unfair, he can deny service. But if the doctor agrees with the client's rating, he sees a discerning customer more than a negative one.


The medical industry is extremely slow and clumsy due to litigation. If we could provide a fast alternative where the user is protected by transparent doctor reputations, and the doctor is protected from litigation through pseudonymity, it could be a very effective way around what is currently the only option. We can debate about how safe it would be, but would be such a stretch to think it might be a somewhat effective, badly needed alternative to the options we have today?


Doctors and patients in the existing framework must have government approval to transact, limiting many options that should only be the business of the two parties involved. Conventional doctors are constantly incentivized to support the existing framework; in a darknet health market, doctors are incentivized to cultivate positive reputation through a voluntary reputation system.


Bitcoin has enabled this idea to be possible for the first time in history, because without pseudonymous business you can't have pseudonymous medical transactions. I think it could be an idea worth trying out, now that we have the opportunity.
Thanks for the questions!

People that want drugs for recreation will have better ways to get them than this site. Why pretend to get medical marijuana rather than just go to Agora and order recreationally? Medical patients will use this site, and will rate for medical effectiveness.


And yet, we have operating dark markets that still haven't been taken down. We're becoming effective at running these markets. Maybe not perfect yet... but we are learning fast, and it's working pretty well. Some people clearly think the risk of running a darknet market is worth it, because behold, they exist and function.


You don't need a college degree. You just need advice that's good enough to build a good reputation. And if you use cryptography correctly (a stretch for some, but possible), you are protected from risk, whether doctor or user.

You could make exactly the same argument about existing dark net markets. A recreational drug's "effectiveness" is incredibly subjective. And yet, somehow, we have functional pseudonymous drug markets, which are far from worthless. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:39:09
A key aspect to dark markets is that, if a user or vendor can correctly use cryptography, they can completely protect themselves from any kind of pressure, because no one can find out who they actually are.

I think most of us understand how the Internet works: don't trust someone unless you have a compelling reason to. You ask a mask on the Internet his opinion, you take with with a grain of salt. Especially if he's making money on you. Trust is risk; I think we all know that.
But just like ebay and silk road, good vendors can build trust sufficiently to generate a good reputation, and a smart user can reliably find those vendors, given the right tools.

I'm not claiming that the system would be perfect. The existing medical industry has its own dangers, and this new market would have its own as well. That doesn't mean that it would be a useless alternative.
Of course the quacks will come. Does that mean the market as a whole would be a useless tool? I'm sure there are scammers on darknet markets, but somehow they operate well regardless.
The reason I say doctors not being sued is a good thing, is because it removes the ability for an entrenched medical industry to cow the doctor. Within the existing system, there are incentives to primarily prescribe medication, and mitigate other suggestions like lifestyle changes, diet, or exercise.
Part of the point is that the credentials and qualifications are irrelevant, to some degree. Credentials are designed to be a tool to filter out good doctors from bad ones. The proposal is that a reputation system would be a better method--or at least a viable alternative method with its own pros and cons.
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:17:07

To me, the biggest thing that throws me off is that your wizard seems to be **all** after-image.

I like almost everything about this picture, but to me it was not apparent that he was *escaping* the flames... Unfortunately I can't really think of an easy way to fix this. I mean, maybe you could move the flames a bit back in the scene, but I imagine that would be a lot of work, and in any case he'd then be flying away from the flames *and* (what I assume to be) his castle...
But it's still great enough to be included in [the placement post]( If you somehow fix this ambiguity with the flames I will definitely bump you up, and part with another 3 mBTC!
And actually, another thought just hit me on the picture. I think it might be the shading on the box the wizard is in that's throwing me off--the way it's lit by the flames makes me think the box is right there, very close to the flames...

Alright. Someone sent me a personal message that I think wins in first place, but he hasn't yet posted it here. I'm giving half of the prize to you, and if he doesn't show in a few days, I'll give you the other half too. I'm also adjusting the price up a bit to 0.26BTC, since bitcoins were worth a bit more on Friday, when I was supposed to award them.

To be honest, I have mixed feelings on this.
The face zoomed in is better, but it's a little too blurry, and zooming in without adding more definition seems to detract from the image just a bit.
I also like how the Bitcoin's effect takes up more real-estate, but I wonder if you could switch the color scheme: instead of going from light colors (near the center) to dark (near the Bitcoin and its "influence"), maybe you could switch it? Or change it some other way--I just feel like Bitcoin's effect should feel a little "purer" than the image implies atm, if that makes sense?
And I actually also liked the original Bitcoin symbol more than this second one. If it was more *glowy* (right now it looks a bit more *blurry*) I could see this second one being a better choice overall, though.

I know I pledged 3, but part of what I was really excited about was more detail on his face. I should have perhaps made that more clear :/ If you can put more good detail in there I'll give you the last mBTC, but other than that I'm afraid I have to save some money for future entries...
Thank you so much for doing this!

I wasn't sure what type of response I would get. If most people want more time, we can do that. However, I'd rather stick to this timeline, and then possibly fund and plan a longer-term one afterward, possibly with different or more open prompts.
I agree about licensing; I actually just totally forgot to mention that in the OP. All content will be released with effectively no license. I'll make an edit with details.

Just a couple of things I'd recommend. If you happen to heed them, I will slice off a millibitcoin for you.
- Could you change him to not actually represent Harry Potter specifically? I like the style, but I think an ambiguous character could be more interesting.
- As I've mentioned to many other people, in my opinion, making the Bitcoin seem to belong in the scene is one of the most important parts of this.
The contest definitely lasts until the new year's eve UTC, exactly.

I appreciate the response! I'm looking for something that shows how bitcoin is creating opportunity and power for individuals in an unprecedented way. Your tool is really neat, but it deals very little with the intrinsic value of bitcoin. I'm also looking for more of a description of amazing collaboration than tools for collaboration.

I wonder if you could make the Bitcoin seem a bit *deeper* into the image if you darkened the lit point of the wizard's hat? Something makes it seem to "pop out" of the picture, and to me it seems like it's because of the way it lights up the tip of the hat.
Another cool modification would be to make his "bitcoin magic" affect more than just the area of the bitcoin symbol itself. Magic-y visual effects could fan out into the back and top of the scene.
I am digging the heck out of that scowl. If you zoomed in a bit, and sacrificed a bit of midriff for more zoom or detail on the face, it might effect the mood of the image in a pretty cool way.
If you do all of these things, I'll give you another 3 mBTC!
@_date: 2013-12-27 09:11:26
Awesome! I am really digging how much you're sharing with us on your development of this.
Do you have access to screen recording and editing software? I would *love* to see basically a time-lapse video of you doing a few hours of work. If you don't have the software, don't worry about it--they are a pain to set up and learn how to use, imo.

@_date: 2013-12-29 04:13:45
First of all, I actually really like pixel art, and again, what you made looks really professionally done.
For the contest winner, I guess one way to say it is that I'm looking for more detail. When I look at the contest winning picture, I want to be able to look at it for more than a second or two and find a lot of different things that are interesting. Your picture is very high-quality and polished, but less detailed--and therefore, at least in some small way, slightly less interesting. To me, at least.
Just some random ideas: Add more wizards, each with their own color/stance/weapons; and/or add an environment possibly with enemies/obsatcles/other videogame stuff? Like I said, the style is great--it's just that the other entries have *more* overall to look at. I hope that clears things up a bit? Let me know if you have any other questions!
If you made a short .gif of the wizard doing some action, I don't really know if that would qualify as "a picture" for the contest... but I would definitely pay at least 7 mBTC for a simple cool little animation. Up to you!
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:21:35

If anyone makes these edits I will give them 1 mBTC:
- Make the dollar sign small and in the "foreground", near the bottom of the picture, then make the wizard larger to "loom" ahead of it
- Replace the dollar symbol with something a bit less silly--like a scan of a dollar or the $ symbol
- Increase the amount of space between the words and use a slightly smaller font, and place this line between the wizard and the dollar symbol.
- Take out the weapons, replace both with staffs that are long enough to touch the ground.
- Move the Bitcoin symbol from the wizard's face to one or both of the staffs (whatever looks better)
Do that and 1 mBTC is yours.
I'll tip up to 5 mBTC total if you also:
- incorporate more colors
- put a background in, emphasize different colors than the rest of the picture to represent change
- put a path so we can visualize the "blocking" more

I agree that the face part looks odd. To my untrained eye, it appears that the hat is too high--as it is, it seems like we should see an eye on the left side of his face, but we don't, so his face seems a bit off. If you lowered or reoriented the hat, I bet you could "cover" the eye that should be there, thereby fixing the odd look of it. Alternatively you could try raising the moustache/beard, or even add (a bit of?) an eye (although I think I like the fact that you can't see his eyes).
Either way, if you fix that weirdness and maintain the nice look of this, another 2mBTC is yours!

Not trying to pull clicks. I'm not interested in developing an effective ad as much as paying for a bit of art. One of the main things I noticed about the current winner, for example, is how the Bitcoin staff really convincingly "lights up" the figure of the wizard. The shading is just really well-done overall, and it's more "believable", even if in a cartoonish way.

For me, the only thing that doesn't stand out like the rest of the picture is his facial structure and features--it seems a bit flat. I don't really know how one would go about fixing that, though.
Do you have the means to speed that video up to do a sort of quick time lapse? If not, I could do it for you. I think it could look pretty awesome to see a picture develop quickly like that.

I was looking more for the technical details of how you put it together. For example, the Bitcoin coin symbol at the bottom just seems blended in with the scene really well. How did you achieve that? Maybe it's a simple photoshop trick, but I'm still curious...
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:53:44
I'll gladly part with 1 mBTC if:
- you get his express permission to use his artwork for this
- you more effectively embed the Bitcoin into the scene.
Right now, the realism of the coin sort of jars against the anime style, for me anyway. Could you render some sort of wiremesh or vector art instead to illustrate Bitcoin? How would a Bitcoin look in an anime...?

There is something I don't like about how the particle effects of the other bitcoins are oriented. Have you tried making it so that every bitcoin that has those effects are either pointing to or away from the staff's head?
In fact, if you made that change, and added more in number (does it take long to do that?) it could make the image look pretty epic--like the wizard is sort of saturating the forest with his magic [internet money].

I like the rays coming from the Bitcoin, but I have one suggestion that you may take or leave:
As it is, the rays of light from the Bitcoin (which I like overall!) seem to be 100% "in front" of the wizard, which in turn visually implies that the Bitcoin staff itself is "in front" as well. I bet if you made the rays a bit more transparent or less bright where they go over the wizard, making some of the light seem to go behind him, the depth of the Bitcoin would seem more consistent.
If you wanted to get fancy with the effect, you could leave some areas of the light unaffected (like near the top of the hat, since that part *should* be a bit behind the staff), and take out more of the light in other places (just under the brim of the hat, which should block some of the light)
A lot to ask for, and I have to save some money for other people, but these are my thoughts--again, I love this!
