I'll participate in this :) I am a bit suspicious of this, but if you do manage to get in to it and not rightfully split the bounty with whoever helped crack it, it'd still be cool to see you get the 20BTC, so that we can help another service strengthen their security.

Nice job on the referral.
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:16:34
Currently only Bitcoin can be tipped, but there are plenty other tipbots for altcoins!
@_date: 2014-11-11 01:59:14
Wow, thank you!

* Try to make online content.
* Make quality posts, hoping you will be tipped (do this regardless of tips.)
* Faucets, such as Freebitco.in ([Non-referral]( [Referral](
* Offer services. For instance, * Many, many other ways.

Exactly this, to the point of when we compare **USD to BTC**, not BTC to USD.

Hey there! 
I've heard quite a bit of it with all my internet adventures, and of course, from news sites. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:20:58
Wow! I appreciate the generosity! I'll be sure to pay it forward :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:03:47
It was confirmed that it was not faked.
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:14:44
Wow, that's a lot! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:00:43
As mentioned, what's the turnout of students actually keeping their bitcoin? Have you been asked to buy people's bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:11:35
Quite true indeed.
In fact, yesterday I had introduced myself, and got a few fairly large (at least to me) sized tips. Then along with that, came many friendly people, but also a few haters saying that I was just trying to farm bitcoin, which was quite untrue.
Though, I definitely wouldn't want the large tippers to stop tipping, purely to the fact there are a few negative people trying to discourage them.
But yes, I do agree with you to a point. And it surely doesn't entice newcomers to stay with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:21:33
Heck, the largest tip I received was worth $1, which is really awesome to me. But it certainly didn't feel good getting called out as panhandling.
@_date: 2014-11-11 21:45:54
Also, add this to the tip!

This is how you get scammed.

That's strange, maybe contacting Circle will help get the problem fixed.

This isn't a troll post.
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:14:39
From the sound of the post, it doesn't seem like they have BTC addresses. You could possibly mail them a paper wallet, or call them up on the phone and walk them through getting a wallet, then purchase a BTC for them.

Thank you! I'll definitely be sure to!
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:49:57
Hm? What's that smell? It must be the smell of a scam!
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:31:30
Will do :) Will you be able to notify me when/if you're actually able to get in to it?
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:29:09
Wow... I honestly don't know how to thank you enough. I truly do appreciate your generosity, and will most definitely pay it forward.
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:24:21
From my point, the only downside is that they need to do the regular ID verification, like most exchanges/bitcoin buying services.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:26:02
Thank you, I appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:14:20
It'd be very helpful to know this. Quite a few times I've wanted to discuss this with others, but don't to come off as making BTC sound like a adult-in-his-mothers-basement currency, if you know what I mean?
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:24:11
Hmph, I wish! I'd be a millionaire by now ;)

Huh? Pretty sure a few minutes ago I saw a post (now deleted) by you sharing the exact same video, except explicitly saying that it wasn't you.
What's up with that?
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:04:10
Thank you!

Ah, ok. Title was somewhat misleading. Sorry bout that :)
10 bits @_date: 2014-12-18 23:42:24
Yeah, that's pretty true. That's still why I like Coinbase, despite some may or may not like some of their practices.
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:18:23
I'd imagine because they'll lose some of their oh-so-greedy but oh-so-precious income.
Another reason why BTC is far superior :)

Do her parents in Chile already have Bitcoin? If so, why not just use a direct BTC transaction?
If not, ANX supports Chile dwellers. They could buy some Bitcoin from there, then just send it off.

Though the common uneducated people may think this, if they make the most miniscule amount of research, they'd learn you can't really "hack" Bitcoin.

At least you were able to buy BTC from them. They didn't like my verification, so they wanted my ID. No thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-11 01:59:29
Thanks for the info! It really helped.

Erm, I'm afraid to click on that link. What does it lead to?
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:38:36
Actually, there's an "instant verify" option as to where you can enter your bank details and they verify it, well, instantly.
@_date: 2014-11-11 01:58:48

Some are due to the more just not liking crypto, and others having bad experiences with the bot (I.E tip spam on a major scale)
This sub may not have specifically banned it, but I found it better to ask permission before doing so.
