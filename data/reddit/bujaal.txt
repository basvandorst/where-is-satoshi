Yeah and I think that's good advice. 
However, I think that SOME of us know that something might cause Bitcoin to crash and burn tomorrow, but I see a lot of posts here that make it seen untouchable. 
And I think if you like what it represents and want to buy in, do it, but not now. A lot of people scoff at me saying the dip will never come, but we have seen this before. Both in the history of Bitcoin and the history of other commodities.

Probably not. There's a massive bubble right now. The price will likely drop at some point. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:25:09
You're right, but it could also be worth $1 in 10 years time. Just be careful is all I'm saying.

I can't believe how many people think that a dip is never coming...look at the chart. That is not based on fundamentals.
This sub is ridiculously optimistic.

Don't listen to them. People in the sub are insanely optimistic. I'd trust a finance expert way more than any bitcoin expert about what's going to happen to the price of bitcoin. 
Ultimately though, no one knows. My opinion is that a crash is coming and it's going to be very obvious in hindsight. Might go up a little more before that happens though, no one knows.

Hey not OP, but I'm a little confused too. I get the idea that it's less anonymous if you keep using the same address, much like the more comments I make on this Reddit account, the more likely it is you'll be able to figure out who I am.
But in that case, why does it matter if it's paper or not? 
Also, if I am using Bitcoin day I say to make purchases, am I really expected to move all my money to a new wallet every time I do anything? That just doesn't seem right, so I think I'm missing something.

If you think a crash is coming, why did you buy? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:07:56
The difference is that unlike bitcoin, gold is extremely unlikely to drop or gain 50% of its flair overnight. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:29:43
Until it remembers.

If you have to ask, then no, that was not THE dip.

IMO, yes. No asset ever goes up like bitcoin and has and just stays there based on speculation. I'm almost certain it will come down. Might not stay down, but it will go down. 
Don't trust this sub. Waaaaay too many people in an echo chamber with a 'nothing will ever go wrong, this is the future' attitude. It's possible that bitcoin will be a bust and it will be worth 0 in 5 years time. There is NEVER such a thing as a sure thing.
