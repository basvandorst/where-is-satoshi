Hope you get your shit back, and that their shade gets the appropriate sun

This could potentially lead us to more ingenuity concerning green energy

I thought our money was backed by oil?

The ledger is public, but that doesn't mean the identities of those transacting are, right? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:25:03
Start selling shot for it, then

If you knew the context in which the latter was stated, you might just be a little more wise.

I'd be more willing to spend my crypto as soon as the last bitcoin is mined, otherwise it's a waste, cause the volatility is gonna kick your ass
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:57:11
When there's no more bit coins to be mined, and the price levels out 
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:53:29
Don't buy bitcoin you guys ;)

You haven't already been doing this?!
I swear the cashiers at Fry's are getting real tired of me.

I definitely have 17 dollars

I mean the term shitcoin is relative. They're both cryptos, and this guy wasnt exactly shilling them either. It was actually a good thesis on the pros and cons of stable coins. Something I would think most people in the space would like to know about. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:02:42
Oooooo, now i get it!
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:20:57
Youd probably be better off buying the actual crypto. But, you could start stocking up on cards and when the price booms again start mining 
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:09:18
Dont fuck with Texas
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:40:07
Almost there!!
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:48:15
Major what? 
@_date: 2018-12-23 17:34:41
I mean, it's kinda related 
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:13:43
Well, it ain't workin' tuhday
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:34:06
Poor guy :(
