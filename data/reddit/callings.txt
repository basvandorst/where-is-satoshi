can u downvote more than once
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:50:50
I think u overestimate the amount of people that won't let the government fuck with their money. 
And yes the market will probably rebound but not because of above.

Please elaborate. Some reason looking at your picture makes me think the bigger carrot is bitcoin cash

Don't do stop losses, worst advice. The advice before that is don't margin trade. And buy it out right.

-high fees
-congested network 
-coin base adding nah
-media article about bitcoin.com owner selling all his bitcoin
-bch performing as intended
You may be right in the matter that don't worry we will recover, but you cannot ignore the factors that are causing the drop and to label it as a simple pump n dump by two people is very silly.
Do you really think Roger just wants to make quick money, or does he actually really believe in the plight of bitcoin cash.

Noooo how dare you be logical. Don't you know that the only financial principle that applies is hodl.

I find ta to work more reliably in bitcoin markets, you just have to be careful when shorting as there is so much upside potential anyways. Back to my main point the fundamentals are fuzzy what else do people have to go on? TA

@_date: 2017-12-02 07:46:35
It's actually really hard for people that early. If they followed price it had the most craziest crashes etc. I'd assume several sold, imagine buying it for a few dollars and then it reaches 100 and selling . I'm sure there are many people who have done that. And how must they feel now that's it's 10k haha

@_date: 2017-12-04 20:21:29
I for one. Think bitcoin is a lot more easy to understand than how the the federal reserve system works. And I also think you all are greatly overestimating your understanding of economics, upvoting pointless memes about overthrowing governments and such.

One main point. Futures allow institutional investors into the market.  Key word institutional. If you thin these guys cannot move the market you are a fool.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:11:30
Two conflicting but not exclusive views. You associate success with price while early adopters might be more into the cyber punk anarchy business associate success with mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:10:54
Far thank god. I was wondering where all the memes went 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:42:49
It doesn't let them into the market per se. But now there will be  arbitrage opportunities and they have to enter the market to do these successfully pull off these trades.

Hahaha hahaha which front page. That's hilarious and sadly true.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:55:46
Feels like you just pointing out another element. Which in this case is arbitrage opportunities. But would there not always be a difference between the spot price and a futures contract that expires in month. I mean it is quite volatile. Wouldn't you say.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:31:51
Yeah hodl of stocks and companies where he can do real fundamental analysis, and determine a safety margin. Closest thing in crypto for valuation might be metcalfes law, but given this is the first wave of crypto so can't really be compared to anything else.

@_date: 2017-12-09 16:32:02
Because all it's done is gone up. Each time it dipped and went up again. Most of the people in here have no investing experience, that coupled with the gains and memes has lead them to believe this is unstoppable. 
Like there is literally no bubble like behaviour in their eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:31:13
Really shows your compassion and care for the community. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:11:20
Haha que buy the dip, "hold" , flash sale posts.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:49:18
Yes. But what he is talking about is arbitrage, risk free profit if executed correctly. I buy a contract that let's me sell bitcoin in January at price of 18k, current bitcoin price is 15000. I now buy an actual bitcoin off an exchange for 15000. 
Price moves either way I make money. If bitcoin drops my futures contract goes up and I lose money on my actual bitcoin. If bitcoin goes up   I get the gains and lose money on the contract.
Say price in January is 20k, profit from bitcoin 5k,loss from contract 2k. Net profit 3k
Say price is 13k, profit from contract is 5k, loss from bitcoin is 2k, net profit is 3k.
Overly simplified btw.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:24:17

I agree. Realised how some people who hold bitcoin have no financial competence at all.
Don't know what's worst. People who don't understand bitcoin talking shit about it.
People who understand bitcoin, but not how the economy and the financial world works, or even acknowledge the complexity and difficulty of such things talk shit.
Ps. Definitely the latter.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:15:48
Freedom and autonomy from banks sounds good. But do all you think banks do is print money and collect fees. 
What do they do for society ? How does a central bank help run a country. What do they do in crisis.

@_date: 2017-12-09 16:16:24
Don't come in here with your logic mumbo jumbo. Don't you know hodl &gt; all financial and economic theory. It's not like banks print money in times of crisis etc , not like there are both good and bad sides to centralisation and regulation. 
Decentralisation and deregulation is the way to go.

Yeah didn't you know, hoping for  chaotic order so hodlers can be rich is very humanitarian.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:54:58
Some of the effect will be from hedging. I.e. buy bitcoin and sell futures and vice versa.
As mentioned in thread already. A more specific example. 
Get contracts allowing you to sell bitcoin for 12000, hedge this by buying bitcoin at current price 11500.
Bitcoin goes to 13000, lose 1000 on the contract. Make 1500 on the actual underlying aka bitcoin. 
Net profit : 500
Bitcoin goes to 10000, sell the contract for 2000 profit, lose 11500 on the actual bitcoin. Net profit : 500.
This as you can see will already affect the price. 
But it also opens up for bigger plays. I.e. Say some big boys decide to buy a bunch of futures allowing them to sell at current price or whatever. Then they do big sell orders on the crypto exchanges, this drives prices down and earn then profit.
P.s. extremely simplified, and from someone with a very basic understanding of markets etc
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:01:18
Hey where would I find this info. Is it some calculation with the total number of bitcoin they own and stock price etc. Or is there a website with it already presented .
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:28:54
The point is not for them too make money off each other, but mainly the general public who have no investing knowledge and all the fomo members.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:29:56
Can you not post your financial knowledge in this sub please. Also try refrain from using logic as well. Hodl hold

@_date: 2017-12-04 20:17:58
No way ! Only thing to be financially competent is HODL. 
Let's just hope third world countries currencies fail so they have to use bitcoin ( really don't see any negatives ), and also don't forget double digit returns are absolute crap, rookie numbers !  
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:40:47
Don't you know bitcoin is on another level of existence in the financial world. It is immune from the human factor, any negative aspects of human behaviour. And inbuilt in bitcoin is already a perfectly balanced ecosystem of all actors, so there is no need for economic management.
But sure, focus on fiat to push your agenda for crypto in this case as the OP has done. Inflation is so bad, therefore deflationary currencies are the way to go amirite.
@_date: 2018-08-12 16:45:56

Nah man don't come in here with your reasoning and differing point of view. Banks bad crypto good and perfect :/ 
@_date: 2018-05-19 01:18:20
And crypto is infallible to all these. I'm pretty sure there are worst things going on in crypto maybe to the not the same scale.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:39:49
Because people are framing trillion dollar Zimbabwe notes as a reminder of why the system the system will fail. What happened in Zimbabwe could happen anywhere else even in the US.

Can anyone point me to articles relating to segwit and what is the basis of this tweet.
All im able to find is conspiracy like theories regarding deviation from Nakamoto's vision, vested interests of corporations and the ousting of original developers. NYA seems to have been pointless as well?

Think u spelt that wrong. Believing in tech aka try to get rich quick and on to the fomo train 
@_date: 2018-06-20 03:11:07
What is the point you are trying to convey.
Are you putting emphasis on the extremes of inflation, caused by horrible economical and political running of a third world country, or what irresponsible handling of national debt can lead to?
Is Bitcoin the solution, and fail proof. Is bitcoin immune to the complex and dynamic nature of economics. Hence what has happened to these fiat currencies cannot happen to crypto?

Haha I was being sarcastic. Impact of blockchain seems very limited for now, maybe in the future it will revolutionise something somewhere. But its impact is really overstated and hyped by the community, this of course has died down as the market and price did. But during those moon days oh boy. Bitcoin was gonna put us 50 years ahead on our technological timeline.

Nah it's just expensive for no reason 
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:44:09
Nice. What you forget is you have an entry point that varies differently to others. Maybe if you said I bought at 500 and held as it plummeted to 50$ for a year. 
Other then that of course it's easy for you to spew that nonsense.   
How about the guy down 12x LOL

Yeah guess so. Gotta understand where they are coming from, I also assume people in crypto don't really have a financial background either. But anyways telling someone in those subs for example about unregulated internet money haha how else would they react. 
But anyhow, say you got hacked and lost your crypto.  What options do you have?

Market cap for crypto and companies are indeed differeny in my views. They dont hold the same weight, but OP has a point companies are producing real shit. We can value them based on their earnings etc. What about in crypto? the cost of mining a coin? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:50:31
Had to go to bitcoinmarkets to find out. That the first BTC LTC atomic swap happened + a swiss bank announced a futures product for BTC releasing tomorrow. Non of this is on the front page here u fucken memers

Oh ok. What I got from what you said was you recovered it successfully with your wallet seed, but then forgot your password so didn't make sense to me.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:21:14
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:53:42
Do you know prices moves, doesn't just go straight up in a line. Theres retracements.
Even more so in highly speculative instruments, what would you expect to happen with Bitcoin Cash after it smashes through the ATH, just chill up there? Keep going up forever?
OFC there is going to be a drop in price, and from there it may find a higher bottom floor.
This exaggeration with the biggest pump and dump in crypto history nonsense needs to stop.
EDIT : Just read your inital post properly, HEARD OF BUY LOW SELL HIGH? of course everyone with a brain would sell BTC at its high, and then seeing BCH rising why would you not put it into that after. You complain this is market manipulation. But this is how the trading world works.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:52:03
I see I see. Thanks for the replies. Far mind blowing stuff this thread

I see. But are these processes revelant nowadays, or do people just use 2fa on exchanges. Or another way to put it. Would only cold/paper wallet users go through this key generation process.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:48:16
No you misunderstand, let's say something happens people lose money.
Would there not be a train of thought, along the lines of. Why didn't the government step in, put more focus, regulate it. Etc. Not talking about bail out here bud.
or Something goes wrong and lots of people lose money = too bad so sad win some lose some price we pay for decentralization etc etc

@_date: 2017-11-30 22:39:16
Alright to clarify, "the people who think they are good at investing because they got into bitcoin" is what I meant. It's not stepping into the area of expertise it's actually not having a clue about it at all, and thinking you do. You'd find a lot of the knowledge can be practically applied and useful.
The technical roles you listed are actually the ONLY people's opinions I hold in high regard in this space.

My take is they made their own currency "pegged" to the us dollar to bypass banking issues, the tether. They then use this to inflate price of bitcoin, hence hoping to attract more people to buy etc and they clean up on fees. Another way is tether just allows for quick liquidity, and a place to sit your "cash" instead of transferring it back and forth between us dollars and crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:12:40
Nah man its a clearly the biggest pump and dump in the history of crypto how can you guys fall for this seriously. BCH prices rocket ( silence ), then price drops : And here comes the DROP GUYS!! FAILED COUPE !!!!!!!nice try!!!!! oh wait looks like it could be a retracement.

Good time to go all in is because Bitcoin is "cheap" at the moment.

@_date: 2017-11-10 23:44:56
Due to the forks free money allure. Everyone bought into bitcoin. And now everyone suddenly wants to get out (into alts for example is one strategy , logic they were bleeding cause of the fork).
Not sure about the average backlog for transactions, but I'm assuming after the fork everyone tried to get out at once and created a bigger than average ( not 100% sure ) backlog. So people noticing delays and high fees maybe having some doubts bout bitcoin. (Wouldn't put too much weight on this but it's a factor )
Issues which are apparently bitcoin cash isn't having. Which brings me to second point. 
Bitcoin cash is newly listed on Korean exchanges, look at price and volume of bch last 24 hours. So people might be riding the wave there.
Also people bought in around 10k fomo. Are now panicking and getting out. Non seasoned investors and market psychology causing a overreaction. 
Also correction might be in the works. Shout out to the 10% you call this a correction ? Crew u guys rock (not)

Balls of steel and kudos for having that faith early. 
But id say your perception is skewed by the relative success of your investments.  BTC was profitable at start and built your faith, down the track much was already invested in it so you couldn't give up. But reap the rewards my friend youve earnt it.

No I mean by the fact that is a fork of "Bitcoin". Attention was already mainly focused on Bitcoin and the fact that it would fork, naturally gives its fork attention as well. Different to someone just making a new coin and call it Bitcoin x , refer to BitcoinDark etc and see how well they are doing.

Nothing to do with huge run up of bitcoin and bleeding of alts. 
Then the cancellation of 2x and a drop in bitcoin. Nah I agree these effects wouldnt have added any thing out of the ordinary to the mempool.

My point is you invalidate ta because "it didn't predict a fundamental change", yes I can see where people come from when they don't believe TA. But you think success from using it and trading are only correlated by being extremely lucky is a very naive view. Yes I have read random walk on wall street and other similar books. But you cannot deny ta. It is the fundamental base of supply and demand it's just been warped to include these silly subjective concepts, especially in crypto people predicting 19k in two months because of a "double bottom"
