You don't understand how exchanges work.

Wait, the exchange that offers 50x leverage and fake their own volume are slamming the competition? Color me amused if it wasn't so pathetic.

Oh you are just darling. I have been active in Bitcoin since early 2012, and know more about Bitcoin than most. The 1 MB limit is an OBVIOUS issue, that is currently holding price and adoption back.

If you are truly so dumb that you take 'rat poison' literally, I guess we can just conclude that you should probably not leave the group home. I realize that it's nice and cozy over at but here in the real world, we don't assume that just because an agency is federal they are useless and evil.

Let's ballpark is to 75k BTC daily volume average across all currencies and 0.4% volume profit (bundling in loans etc. into this), that would give us around $3.75 million in monthly revenue, of which I assume over 80% is profit.  That's a business!
@_date: 2016-04-14 14:29:14

Yeah, not 4x median fee from a few months ago or anything. I mean $20k in fees per day is almost nothing. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 18:26:48
Observable reality is that Bitcoin price has been flat because of this issue, so no. It's not a non-problem. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 19:56:27
Absolutely not, but it's equally stupid to think that Bitcoin is 'just fine' being just a slow transaction layer for large payment and value hoarding. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:42:19
And since the block reward will disappear 'pretty soon' fees should be at credit card parity soon right? Cause 1 MB blocks, would require fees that make bitcoin uselessly expensive with no block reward. Think before you type.
@_date: 2016-04-22 21:13:45
Quite obvious that the market does since price has been stagnant or down ever since the discussion started. To claim it's not affecting price is straight up retarded.

That is true.

Depends entirely on how you view it. If you have cancer and take homeopatic medicine for it, you will die just as fast as if you were actually eating poison vs. actual medical treatment.
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:45:18
As per the vision of Satoshi, bitcoin is no longer on track to be a useful mass payment system with low fees. With perpetual 1 MB blocks, either fees will reach credit card parity for small to medium transactions or it will be too slow to be useful for everyday payments.

Because it's entirely technically feasible for it to be just that. The fact that people became scared of change the minute Bitcoin became valuable doesn't change the fact that it was designed to be improved, not stagnant because people are too pussy to take a risk and improve it.

You dumb bastard. It's not a "fee market", it's a non functional fee system due to block size cap.

Well, I just bumped the price $580 trying to nab it, so I guess that's good :)
@_date: 2016-04-14 11:48:45
That's the point. Bitcoin isn't any longer what it was purposed to be, because development isn't keeping up with usage. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 18:26:03
And that works fine, until Bitcoin price moves in any direction and blocks are full for 48 hours. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:03:18
And what's blatantly clear about that comment is that you are too dumb to understand that it's not ignorance of technology that keeps the status quo, but the fact that the current system works just fine for the powers that be, and they have no motivation to improve it.
@_date: 2016-04-14 21:48:26
I would prob argue that the fact that you can spam the Bitcoin Blockchain into non-usability for a few $100s is a pretty big problem. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:55:40
Though nothing technically stops shapeshift from absconding with your funds either.
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:58:29
Wait, what is your point? We are still at 1 MB, and really bad things ARE happening. Several hour confirms, full blocks, and the entire model of Bitcoin basically failing as soon as transaction volume increases. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 15:18:28
Agreed, misread your post. I stand by my numbers though, Polo is insanely profitable.
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:00:55
Absolutely, but that's already being discussed and in some cases implemented. As per the FDA!

@_date: 2016-04-14 18:00:30
Completely beside the point. There are no 'altruistic' solutions to the bitcoin problem, period. If you think that the same people that could work on solving the bitcoin problem in core run privately funded projects just 'to be nice', I'm gonna guess you are the one with learning disabilities. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:01:49
Why would you have to track price? If you use Bitcoin as a means of payment you can simply use coinbase to top-up automatically to your wallet, and connect that wallet to Pluton.it and voilais, you always pay 'market price' and simpler and more secure than debit or credit cards.
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:55:21
Fork is far less risky than a drawn out pointless discussion that leads to nothing and leaves bitcoin a crippled system left behind by competition.
@_date: 2016-04-14 21:46:31
That's a pretty stupid argument when nothing has happened in the block size debate for 15 months.

You sure are doing a lot of seeing horses, and calling them zebras. The FDA regulates medication not for the reason that people put poison in it for shits and giggles, but to protect people from useless or dangerous meds. If you have problems understanding that you should probably stop taking whatever herbs you are, and get some help. /Yours truly, strawman. Whatever the fuck that means to retards like you.
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:54:56
Sure, but there will of course be no money to get from it. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:06:48
1. So if you are not of the opinion that the FDA are actively trying to kill people you are a Strawman. Ok, back to kindergarten with you.
2. Yes, if you take 'medication' that is water and 1 ppm duck liver and expect any effect you are an idiot. 
3. There is absolutely nothing stopping anyone from putting whatever they want in Homeopathic medicine, as opposed to drugs regulated by the FDA. There is of course no reason to put poison in it, since plain tap water is cheaper and idiots will still buy it.

Yes, the FDA surely tries to kill people. Not at all to avoid things like the Tuskeegee experiments, or the fetal deaths of the 70s. Also, if you take homeopathic medicine you are an idiot, and might as well just go ahead and eat rat poison since it does the same amount of good for you. The FDA can't protect you from stupid.

Gavin, in my opinion is very intelligent but a terrible judge of character and slightly socially inept. aka. the perfect victim for an advanced long con of the kind that Craig has hones his skills in his entire life. I also find it fairly fascinating that Gavin of all people is invited to London, but not Martti Malmi, the one person who co-authored most of Bitcoin core in close cooperation with Satoshi in 2009-2010.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:17:43
What I don't understand is that among the wild theories of why, how and what is going on. Not once has someone considered that this is all just a 'mole hunt', and that possibly Craig and Co. are simply trying to smoke out the real SN.

It can only be one of 3 things. 1. Craig is a part of what used to be a 2 or 3 man team that wen't under the moniker 'Satoshi'. It's been fairly widely accepted that 'Satoshi' was not a single person. 2. Gavin was duped by a con artist. 3. Gavin is in some way 'in on it' under duress, for the wrong reasons or something otherwise unknown.
