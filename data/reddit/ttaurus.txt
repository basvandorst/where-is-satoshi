I once went to a bar. It was so crowed I could hardly breath let alone buy a drink. I left the bar, will never return again and "use" other (bigger) bars.

I think nobody said that the Bitcoin network will fail, but that full blocks will hinder adoption and drive people and businesses away. And I think that proved to be true as I can't recall a big company adopting Bitcoin payments in the last months.

Nobody says Bitcoin won't work because of low throughput. It works and will be working in the future. But many think that it will harm Bitcoins success in the long run.

If "Classicers" wanted to manipulate the results I'm sure that far more than 270 people would have "voted" in total.

It would be a free market if the blocksize isn't constrained.

270 people is not an impressive number as he published his survey on several forums...

If users are using another crypto instead of bitcoin why should they return to bitcoin if the other crypto offers a better and cheaper experience?

What do you mean by DoS? "Spam" transactions? 
A limited blocksize and a high blockspace demand allow for cheap spam attacks. A spammer could gradually increase the average fee with minimal costs as long as his transactions pay the minimum fee or slighly less than the minimum fee. His transactions will not be confirmed but he spams the network. This leads to a big mempool, higher fees and unreliable transactions.
The majority of network traffic is caused by the relay of transactions and isn't influenced by the blocksize. The best spam protection today is the minimum relay fee.
In case of a limited capacity the fee market is artificial. A natural equilibrium of effective blocksize and minimum (relay-)fee can only evolve between miners and users if the blocksize limit is high or unlimited. Therefore a free fee market can only arise if the capacity is significantly higher than the demand. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 22:40:59
Where do you got that number from? Blockchain.info shows an average blocksize in the range of 0.92 MB and 0.57 MB in the last 14 days.
@_date: 2016-03-16 18:40:44
Why should the costs increase significantly if we raise the blocksize limit?
Harddisk capacity? - Pruning
Bandwidth? - blocksonly or thin blocks
Electricity? - ...I'm running a node on a Raspberry Pi 2 and could run a node on my smartphone...
I haven't read any convincing argument why the costs of running a node should increase in case of a 2 MB blocksize limit or why this limit would affect decentralization negatively.

Like I said news are often biased but you can find different and opposing views on the very same channels. You can watch public debates of politicians of different political parties and organisations and the discussions in the Bundestag. All in all the public media is quite balanced and you are enabled to develop an informed opinion.

That's a massive exaggeration. They are way better in terms of quality than private channels like RTL and Pro7. News and political information are sometimes biased but are often countered by shows like "Die Anstalt". Documentaries and science shows like Nano are very informative and are so much better than the garbage running on N24/NTV. Furthermore many radio channels like DeutschlandFunk are funded by those broadcasting fees. Of course it is debatable whether shows like Musikantenstadl or football broadcasting rights need to be funded by the public.
But I gladly pay for quality broadcasting services if the only alternatives are RTL and the like.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:11:56


Nah, you aren't paying for political media only but for science/educational/cultural stuff too. And the latter are vastly superior to the private alternatives. We as a people need those services like we need public healthcare which you also pay for (but hopefully don't need), public infrastructure, public services (police, firefighters), etc.
However, the current fee based system is shit and unfair and should be replaced by a tax, but this will introduce different problems like an even greater governmental influence.

Which wallet software do you use? Wallets like Electrum or BitcoinCore can show you your addresses, others won't.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:38:15


Where did you get those numbers from? With 1000 BTC/day it means that in one year nearly 2 % of the total bitcoin supply is needed to secure the network...

If you didn't authorize a payment (i.e. your bank account got hacked or your ATM card has been skimmed) transfers are reversible. Furthermore SEPA direct debit is reversible. 
A SEPA wire transfer that you authorized is not reversible. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:43:22
For privacy and security reasons you should only use an address once. So ideally a wallet app will give you a new address each time you want to receive coins. Addresses which received coins in the past will be hidden and only the total balance of all addresses is shown.
Edit: I thought my wallet app on Android (Bitcoin/Schildbach) does this (hiding of addresses), but it just lacks a nice overview of all addresses.

SEPA transfers are irreversible, too. But that doesn't mean I will lose my right to get my money back if I had made a mistake.

But Lightning has high centralization incentives. If every Bitcoin transaction on the blockchain is expensive because of the fee structure, I will likely only open a few (or only one) payment channel(s) to big Lightning hubs. There is little reason for Alice to connect directly to Bob, if both can transact through their respective Bitpay payment channels.

Don't try to relativize your statement. You wanted to pay for the infamous cup of coffee with a gold bar, not a nugget ;)
Ofc the employees would be confused, as you are likely the first customer who wants to pay his coffee with gold. You would demand to speak with the owner/manager and explain the deal to him. If the value of the gold bar is worth the extra efford the owner/manager has by accepting gold as payment, he would gladly accept the deal. And if enough people tried to pay with gold it would become an official form of payment in this shop.
Gold was used as a currency for hundreds/thousands of years. Just because we killed the gold standard recently does not mean that gold isn't useful as a currency anymore. I would even argue that in most countries gold would be prefered to the local currency.

It depends on the jurisdiction. If you made a mistake and the receiver got more money than you intended to give him you might be able to sue the receiver to get your money back, provided that you know the receiver.
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:38:10


What a stupid comparison.
We don't want 100 MB or 1 GB blocks now, but we want room for growth. It took Bitcoin 7-8 years to fill 1 MB. Many of us don't want to risk Bitcoins decentralization as some FUDster want to make you believe. We just want Bitcoin to keep up with technological advancements. u/jtoomim showed last year that the network could handle 4 MB blocks and that was before the introduction of Xthin and Compact Blocks. So why don't we use the technical capabilities of the network?
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:00:23
I don't buy that argument. In a few years we might be able to handle 10x or 100x the current capacity. More capacity is always preferable, no? Would you argue that Bitcoin would have been successful if the block size was limited to 50 kb?
I think most people agree that at some point we need a block size increase to even be able to handle the opening and closing of Lightning channels. So why wait while the network is small, homogenous and can already handle larger blocks?

Serious question: Why do you need a SSD for your full node?
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:50:30
Segwit is nice and all and I'm not against it (but it also isn't my prefered solution). Segwit will allow the Lightning Network, which is nice, and will provide further small scaling oportunities (Schnorr signatures), which is also nice. But Segwit as a scaling solution is too little, too late. If it will be activated it will probably take months before it's full scaling potential is realized and we will have the same problems like today. The blocksize limit will still exists and as we bump into the limit we will have the same arguments as before. The only solutions to this problem I can currently think of are either the complete removal of the hard blocksize limit or a flexible limit, which grows according to the technological capabilities of the network.
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:58:22
Are you constantly reading from the blockchain, like a block explorer? So excuse my question, but in your use case do you really need the speed a SSD provides? Why wouldn't a HDD suffice? I'm really interested in your use case :)
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:36:29
The difference sure is interesting. But the rest of my system is pretty dated so that might explain the differences between our loading times. Did you test binaries on SSD, blockchain on HDD?
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:18:42
I did a quick test. First I tested my everday setup. The Bitcoin binaries are installed on my SSD (Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB), but the blockchain data is saved on a normal HDD. I fired up the node software and messured how long it takes to be able to interact with the GUI (i.e. until the splash screen disappears). The result was about 1 minute and 15 seconds. I did this test several times and the loading times varied only by a few seconds.
Next I copied the blockchain data (blocks and chainstate) onto my SSD and configured the program to load the data from this location (-datadir=&lt;dir&gt;). So both the binaries and the blockchain data are located on the same SSD. I measured the loading times again and found that it took about 1 minute and 5 seconds to start the node.
I didn't test if the binaries installed on a HDD influenced the loading times nor did I test reindexing the blockchain.
In conclusion I would argue that the blockchain data located on a HDD doesn't influence the loading time significantly. So refering to your first comment: you don't need to buy a new SSD if the blockchain overgrows its capacity. Just buy a cheap HDD and point your node to it.

If you want to run a full node, why don't you rent a VPS and connect a SPV-wallet to it?
@_date: 2016-09-02 16:15:16


The node on my Raspberry Pi is pretty stable.




Yes. If a country can't upgrade its internet infrastructure to modern standards the country might have more serious problems than slow internet and/or a lack of full nodes (political system, corruption, ...).
Most full nodes today can be found in modern and stable democracies ([distribution]( [corruption index]( I would consider the network to be pretty healthy today. A swarm of low-bandwidth/leeching-full-nodes would further increase the load on higher-bandwidth nodes and would rather harm the network.


I think capacity increases (through segwit, lightning, blocksize, ...) are more important to gain new users than the ability to run a full node. The influx of new users will automatically bring more nodes online.


That would be ideal, but we don't live in an ideal world. I think limiting Bitcoins capacity because some countries can't keep up with the technological development is not the right way. But I agree, home users with decent internet connections should always be able to power a full node.
@_date: 2016-09-01 22:58:05


I could get a sufficient VPS starting at 3.50 USD. If you want to keep the whole blockchain you have to rent extra disk space which will cost you more. But you could prune your node and thereby save some money. 


All these points are also valid for ISPs. If one datacenter is not trustworthy or unreliable you could switch to another one. Switching ISPs is more difficult.


I totally agree. Thatswhy I think VPS' are a reasonable option to run a full node for people with (very) low bandwidth.


I wasn't suggesting that everyone should use a VPS. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:44:24
My damn Raspberry Pi runs a Bitcoin node without problems. Should we really aim for potato hardware to sustain a global p2p network?
Edit: Of course, your statement is true. But is it reasonable to constrain the Bitcoin system so much that it can be powered by low-performance computers for the sake of maximum decentralization?
@_date: 2016-05-26 10:56:42
As long as the subsidy exists fees are not that important. The subsidy decreased from 50 btc per block to 25 btc per block. But these 25 btc are now much more valuable than those 50 btc at the time of their mining. The subsidy in terms of btc decreased but it increased in terms of value. To force an artificial fee market right now will hinder Bitcoin's adoption. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 22:36:01


This weight is currently so low (and will be even lower in the future if we don't raise the limit) that it is nearly negligible. There are even options and technologies to lower the demand on bandwidth, latency, storage space, etc. The blockchain is already big enough that "casuals" won't run a full node (because it will take several days to download and validate the blockchain). We could have limited the size of the blockchain by an even smaller blocksizelimit. But the lesser the capacity of Bitcoin is the lesser it's usefulness is. New nodes could copy the validated blockchain (blocks and chainstate) from trusted nodes if you don't want to wait days/weeks. Of course that's not ideal but technology is never perfect.


Who are you to decide that for the whole system? I think transactions are currently to expensive. The "fee market" will not work because cheaper alternatives will emerge.
I think we should increase the blocksizelimit in respect to technological advancements.

"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
That's the title of the whitepaper and the vision many people worked on and bought in. If you want to use Bitcoin primarily as a store of value nobody stops you from doing so. I want to use Bitcoin as **electronic cash** as it was intended by it's creator. **So please don't restrict my usage of Bitcoin.**
Furthermore I disagree that Bitcoin is a good store of value.
