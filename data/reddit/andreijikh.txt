Brilliant, best comment on that vid; 
"Reminds me of a story about the parts of the body entering a similar battle about who was in charge.  The brain thought that it should be ... after all, it was the smartest. The heart, the emotions spoke saying they should be in charge. Then the stomach spoke up about how needs and desires drive everything so they should be in charge. The eyes, the owners of vision said they should be in charge and the muscle system also entered the race as being the source of all locomotion. Lastly, the anus spoke up but went so far as to demand that they be in charge ... to which all the other candidates burst out in uproarious laughter. So the anus, now highly offended, closed up tight and shut down. Within a few hours things really started going wrong. The eyes started getting blurry, thoughts started drifting, the arms and legs got weak and the emotions were getting very erratic and even angry. Faced with certain death, all the parts of the body finally capitulated and made the anus the boss over the entire body. The moral of the story ... you don't necessarily have to be smart, have vision, or be strong to be the boss ... sometimes you just need to be the asshole.﻿"

Yea that's true, I told him I would only be comfortable buying them if that's what HE wants. But long term, I think we'll do alright.

I got lucky with mine and found someone on craigslist who was selling it for $60. I can't believe they're going for like $400 right now on Ebay. Everyone wants one before August so prices are way inflated.
