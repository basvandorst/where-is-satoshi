That would mean 1 BTC = $23,400... Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:44:19
I get the same hash rate on my 1070 Ti that’s connected to PCI-E x16 as one that is on x1. Definitely not the bottleneck. 
And by hashrate I mean the ones that are worth it to mine on a GPU, not Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:53:12
Yeah cause it's hovering around $14k or so lol I just asked because no one else said anything, I didn't know if I missed something.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:54:49
Thank you, that sheds a little more light lol

Question: (and forgive the ignorance here, I am not a programmer by any means) would it be possible/feasible to do something like compression on the chain on older transactions to save space?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:30:04
Bitcoin is up 162% from just a month ago. The stock markets have historically seen 7% growth *per year*
Chill the fuck out people. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:20
Yeah, but people are always waiting on a correction instead of just buying in. People asked at $12k and it’s now up over $18k. My point is there’s no way of knowing and you can miss out on a lot of money by waiting. It’s the whole ‘time in the market is better than timing the market’. 
Edit: and of course here’s a correction ;) lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:41
Do you even math? 
Let’s start at 100. A 1,000% gain would put it at $1,100. Then a 40% loss would put you at a $660. Therefore the current delta is 560%, not 960%. 
Using your example, if you have a 100% gain from $100 to $200 then take a 70% loss you’re now at $60. 
Maybe *do* the math you’re making fun of people for before commenting next time ;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:05:19
So wasn’t good enough for that?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:52
I understand that, but it negates your point to a degree. By keeping block times similar, the only way to combat a transaction back-log is to increase your fee. So long as block times stay the same and adoption rate grows, this is only going to get worse is it not?
Edit: To add to my point, [here]( are the median fees, and [here]( are the median confirmation times. Confirmation times have stayed roughly the same, but the fees have increased nearly tenfold.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:35:12
Did you setup to go to your nicehash wallet? You get it deposited once per day over .001 to your nicehash wallet, which is different than your ‘pending deposits’ it shows on the ‘find miner’ screen. 
It also deposits once per week to external wallets over .01. 
I’ve never had any issues at all with them running ASICs. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:55:16
I printed a paper wallet with a couple millibits for everyone in my family, and bought a handful of those little plastic bitcoin coins to make it a little more interesting lol everyone was really interested in the subject at thanksgiving when they asked ‘what the hell was making that loud whirring sound’ in the garage lol told them it was a pair of cryptocurrency miners and had them on the hook for a 20 minute discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:12:04
No... Bitcoin = $1,000,000.00
1 Satoshi is 0.00000001
0.00000001 * 1,000,000 = .01
1 Sat. = $0.01
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:29:55


Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:31:18
No because that’s how bad it all sounds lol

The price is going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:14:04
Mix between exchange fees and Coinbase not having instantaneously updated prices like GDAX so there has to be a spread for them to cover their costs and make money
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:15:56

True, didn’t look at it that way. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:22:32
Considering not a single person here has any idea at all whatsoever, and you would know that if you did the research you say you’re doing, how can anyone answer that?
It’s posted literally hundreds of times a day here - no one can tell the future, so any ‘research’ you do means nothing. It may drop when futures start trading, it may rise. 
The *only* thing that has ever been true in bitcoin/stock market is ‘time in the market is better than timing the market’. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:04:18
Those are fine. The ones that were affected are the nicehash wallets and pending payment balances. If you moved it out of nicehash that is safe, only the stuff still held on nicehash would be hit
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:56:04
Go to the manufacturers website and buy it? Is this seriously a question?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:46:41
This question has been asked every day since 2013. Hindsight 20/20, the answer should have always been a resounding yes. Unless you think bitcoin will crash and never recover, and you can afford to be out $X in cash, I would invest personally. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:29:17
Man, talk about editorializing lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:33
People have been saying ‘correction very soon’ since $5,000 lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:26:22
I wasn’t the original person you replied to lol
But after reading your comment a few more times I now see - after this comment - what you were getting at. The first couple time I read yours it sounded like *you* were saying that. 
You and I are on the same page now. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:30:42
I’ve got a Ledger Nano S and love it. Never tried a Trezor though. It’s a little more a hassle to move coins out of a Nano S than a software wallet, but that just makes me hodl more lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:31:16
That is some crazy paranoia lol just do it offline from the flash drive and you’ll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:58:07
How are those ‘processed’ when that happens then?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:45:11
Down 50% isn’t exactly stable lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:04






But doesn't more mining just increase the difficulty which makes that point moot?

That was your response to me calling you out on not even reading the tweet you referenced? Man you really are an idiot. At least you had those big words to make you feel important!
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:06:13
So you’re saying everyone who buys and sells bitcoin 1) even knows what a future is 2) looks up the futures contracts and 3) blindly believes that they dictate the entire bitcoin market? I swear, if the price doesn’t increase $3k in a day people think bitcoin is dead lol
Bitcoin is a completely different asset than stocks, you need to stop using that as a direct comparison. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:41:01
If you wanted well reasoned or logical arguments, why did you start with an extremely editorialized version of Novo’s tweet? His tweet that you completely incorrectly referenced:


You’re an idiot. You don’t deserve a reasoned argument because you can’t even form your own.

$12/day in electricity would be crazy expensive electricity. I have 2 L3+’s running and spend about $4/day. They make me about 10x that so I don’t mind lol

Sure you did.

What? GDAX and Coinbase are the same thing effectively. Depositing to GDAX will take the same amount of time. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:42:20
Y'all need to stop posting, or go the other way. The market is obviously following you.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:05:49
But that means nothing to the bitcoin community lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:10:48
I know the Blockchain app has a QR code scanner that you can deposit into, but I have no knowledge on these physical coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:08:11
~~You are putting in 100x more than is correct. Your electricity rate is $0.1214/kWh, which would give you profitability.~~
~~A $12.14/kWh rate would put the average electricity bill to about $15,000/month.~~
Edit: You got it fixed before I submitted my comment, nevermind!
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:15:47
Like I said, Blockchain has a QR scanner you can use to deposit into your Blockchain.info wallet.

@_date: 2017-11-02 20:47:38
If you buy in now you'll have the same amount in each coin after the fork.
Whether or not to buy now or wait, the saying is 'time in the market beats timing the market'. 
Like has been said thousands of times in the past couple of weeks here, no one know what will happen.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:26:53

A couple and 10 are very different when we’re talking thousands of dollars each lol
Depending on what antminer, but you’d need 1000w of available power for each, and they wouldn’t be usable at night, morning or evening, severely limiting your return capabilities.

When millions of people try to predict the future, some will inevitably be correct by coincidence. Congrats, you were correct by coincidence. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:32:16
No, it’s called luck and coincidence. 
But whatever makes you feel good man, you’re *obviously* just a humble super genius we should all bow down to. 
Edit: and you were wrong any way lol you predicted a 750% rise from $2,000? That would’ve seen it going to $17,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:40:13
My answer still stands. You’re basically asking me to predict the future of one of the most contentious Bitcoin forks ever. Not a single person right now *knows* what the value of a bitcoin or 2x coin will be other than the amount of actual coins you have. 
Plenty will guess what the values of each will be, some will be lucky and be right, others unlucky and wrong, but from a simple economics standpoint I would say the total value of both combined immediately following the fork would be roughly the same as the value of bitcoin immediately before the fork. What happens once the different coins start being traded is anyone’s guess. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:19:53
ACH transfer takes 5 days and no one bats an eye. BTC takes a couple because of an outlier event and people lose their minds!

You have the completely wrong mindset here. You do not have $20 in bitcoin, you have 0.002739726027397 bitcoin. After the fork, Coinbase will credit you 0.002739726027397 2x coins. 
Bitcoins are not dollar amounts, they are bitcoin amounts.

163 days plus the 120 days until they even begin to mine. In that time you could’ve bought an S9 and mined, and be ahead $2,500 instead of break even.

Yeah, looks like people in the North American time zones started waking up, saw it over $7k and decided to cash out lol I know a couple people who said they’re out if it hits $7k. I’ve been saying I’ll just leave it in until $5k... Then said the same pretty much every $500 interval, but it’s just too fun staying in lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:47:31
These are the people who saw it go from ~$5,700 on October 28 to almost $7,500 on November 4, so think that Bitcoin needs to constantly have a 30% return every 7 days.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:41:50
You’re not gonna find any help for that here lol might help.

At least my bamboozle insurance is covered by bitcoin gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:34:30
Well you would hope that the exchange is trustworthy enough to have cash on hand, but if you trade your bitcoin for cash, that cash is first transferred to the exchange, they take a portion for their fee, then give you access to it. There can’t really be a ‘run’ on the exchange, as you can’t pull cash out until the coin is sold. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:30:03

Sep. 11 to Sep. 14 saw Bitcoin go from $4,210 to $3,250, a drop of 22% in 3 days. 
Nov. 8 to now (time of this comment) saw Bitcoin go from $7,468 to $6,775, a drop of 9% in about 2 days. 
Between those times it rose from $3,250 to $7,900 ATH, a rise of 143% in 55 days. 
SHIT HAPPENS EVERYBODY! This isn't new or unheard of, especially given what's happened the last couple of days.

You get a Nicehash wallet when you sign up. You get paid every time you mine 1 mBit, max once per day. 
If you want to setup an external wallet you will get paid once a week and pay more fees.

@_date: 2017-11-02 15:02:27
Correct, the BTC deposited will not fluctuate from what you ordered.
