IMO this is indeed just the generic warning every central is giving.
"The public is therefore advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency."
From what I have seen in Malaysia not everywhere electronic banking is yet fully working. BTC can be a nice addition to the existing banks (if treated with caution)

What I'm allways missing in donation options is the possibility for the sender to add an e-mail address and Identify himself. 
However, to do that rithgt, it would mean gereating a differt QR code per transaction (like bitpay does). To do it simple, the sender should have the option to give an e-mail address and his public key.

Wow, I would really appreciate a tl;dr of this document
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:17:27
Great stuff, this is what I need for my presentations on bit coins :). If you could add the official documents as a reference I'd be looking at it frequently.
Here's to keep the spirit high.
If you like some of the PDF's, I collected quite a few of the bank statements (e.g. European union etc). Feel free to PM me your email and I'll send them.

Nice :).
Hopefully people will not try to store it as a paper wallet, because my experience with these receipts is that they become unreadable after 2 days in your wallet or 1 month on your desk. But apart from that it's a great initiative.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:59:31
Its working again for me

If I read the comments, I get the impression mt.Gox is pretty involved into all popular websites. That does not surprise me, since they have always been one of the largest and first exchanges. 
*It's a pity to read how this could have gone so wrong.*
Anyway, I still think new users should be informed properly about the risks. Reading all the articles on Reddit the risks at mt.gox at this point in time are much higher then on other Exchanges.

I've e-mailed you the ones I needed for my presentations (and I could read).

Sweet. 
ps. funny username, I assume Dutch.

I can recommend  :)
A charity of my brother in law who runs a one-man charity. He will help the Philippines Typhoon Victims by going there by himself and support an organisation that ONLY works with volunteers. In other words: no overhead costs for expensive TV commercials as he explains on his website.
Any help is very much appreciated.
Ps. My apologies if this is too much promotion, I'm quite new to reddit and do not like to act as a noob. However, I would really like to support him since I think it's so special what he's doing.
@_date: 2014-01-19 08:19:19

I'm happy to see this is the nr one post on reddit.
Well done (mooi gesproken)

You made the news :)
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:13:55
I am really interested to know if they will succeed obtaining a Dutch National Bank license. Giving all the international legislation banks have to comply to, this would open large opportunities for Bitcoin if they succeed.
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:56:26
I could not agree more with you. Let's take it from a positive angle and start promoting the ones that are doing a great job. Positivity works better. +flip

Fun to see in the demo that "[Walter White]( from "Braking bad" now accepts Bitcoin :) I guess that solves his money issues.

I thought this was a funny comment, but it's reality now :(

Yeah finally :)
Blockchain.info was the last newbee-start-page from my post a month ago, that still needed to be anti-Goxed:
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:38:41
Same here, never had any issues
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:29:54
What? 50kBTC stuck!? Am I interpreting this correctly? That's not good for bitcoins' image, I'm sure the press will love to explain this incorrectly again if mtgox falls.
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:48:14
Great :)
@_date: 2014-01-08 12:03:57
Ok, it's working now. Sorry for being a noob ;) 2 lessons learned here. 1 Tipping, 2 Block validation.
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:35:10
I have my ideas on what it is. But for sure if I look at the pending withdrawals, they can use some capital from new clients.
@_date: 2014-01-08 11:38:48
I did not make a depost yet I noticed :) In the process of fixing.
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:56:07
I just checked all my old wallets. But again I did not find 200k BTC. Why does this never happen to me?
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:11:04
In Japan they work a bit longer then till 5PM

Yeah, what are those public and private key's doing there. Transfer your money now! before others help you.

Great, this is going into the right direction :)

I guess they are preparing for a lot of mail as of thursday.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:37:35
Now translate this message onto Mt.Gox.
*Message quote:*


Mt.Gox could also have taken this approach. I fear they found out about the issue much too late.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:11:21
That explains it :)
@_date: 2014-01-08 09:18:10
Ok, so if I understand it correctly, my assumption was correct. If someone adds "illegal transactions" in a block and claims it to be the next one, the rest of the network will ignore the full block.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:48:56
Yeah Euro would be nice.
