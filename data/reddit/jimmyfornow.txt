So very true. And more and more people are beginning to realise this .
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:01:13
Yes and the bags are full of cash �� hehe
@_date: 2019-03-20 12:22:32
We can’t print more when we need it . And we really need hyper inflation 
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:54:52
Nice looking CLS 
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:21:28
See if you can swap it for a real bitcoin . When u can , I know I have lost everything then . 
@_date: 2019-11-03 16:51:50
The fact he forged documents to claim full ownership just proves he has them hidden away in what I would guess is multiple wallets of smaller amounts . 
Jail him till his memory returns
@_date: 2019-03-19 07:57:45
If u think America owing China trillions is good then so be it . 
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:46:44
Yes it can’t be reprinted . Your correct . You can’t make more to loan to other country’s to gain interest on debt and sell the loans and keep recycling your garbage while all along banks charging huge fees for everything . 
@_date: 2019-11-30 20:08:30
It means nothing . But u gotta admire it
@_date: 2019-11-04 10:58:42
Lock him up just like the coins are locked away . 
It may refresh his memory
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:36:36

@_date: 2019-08-03 11:07:13
Keep your trump hate to yourself .
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:32:39
Store of value
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:46:10
Yes memorize them so if anything ever happens to you , at least there lost forever . Great ��
@_date: 2019-06-03 09:39:39
It’s not replacing fiat . 
Had gold replaced fiat . 
It’s being paid for right now using fiat . 
It’s a store of value that has unlimited potential .
@_date: 2019-06-02 07:45:21
This does not make sense . The real creator has never came forward , a fake calling out another fake ! 
Still a fake .
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:14:06
That is so funny . Lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:33:03
Holy shit ��. Give that man a free coin
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:53:31
Other coins
@_date: 2019-06-03 07:06:20
Oh and what is the dollar used for
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:10:56
Give nothing to a trust , you may avoid taxes . But they will eat you up in fees .
@_date: 2019-04-01 23:26:13
Transport money in a split second . I love it . 
@_date: 2019-04-18 12:30:05
I see this differently . 
Them accepting bitcoin donations is all part of the process of using bitcoin as a currency . 
It’s your currency , so as you please with it .
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:42:41
You live 12 miles off the coast in them waters with your gf , 
And the locals realise your a millionaire and the death penalty is gonna be the good way out .
@_date: 2019-04-16 22:51:31
There is never ever gonna be 21 million bitcoin in existence . Or should I say so many bitcoin is lost on the journey . I would imagine the number will be 13 million or so by the time there all mined .
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:22:54
Facebook has run its course , it’s actually just annoying . 
@_date: 2019-04-09 20:22:52
Anything is possible when you rule out the impossible hehe . 
But everyone should own a small amount .
@_date: 2019-04-12 18:33:41
It could change the world for those who own some .
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:33:54
People in bitcoin for the long term
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:09:52
9000 coins that most likely will never be found again . Millions like this .
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:32:23
So there’s enough for everyone . 
@_date: 2019-04-12 15:29:14
With my own money as normal hehe
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:27:59
Ada just for the fun of it lol
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:10:22
Because coinbase are greedy
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:05:29
Everyone should have even a small bit of bitcoin put away . Even a few hundred euros worth in today’s money . 
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:50:19
Do u know how many pirates work off them shores .   Out there u have no protection . Anyway I guess we are all different .
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:35:18
We would have to wipe out a lot of people for this to ever happen 
@_date: 2019-04-03 14:14:22
Wait for 100 years 
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:32:32
Fake news media . Trump exposed the media for what it really is . Blatant lies , 
Bitcoin will do just fine .
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:40:24
Very interesting reading .
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:08:06
The Conor walk is far better .
@_date: 2019-05-18 09:26:43
Absolutely amazing poem . Keeping the faith .
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:11:59
Yes your correct . And why do u feel the need to mention that .
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:22:49

@_date: 2019-05-14 20:59:51
Here is an alarm call . 1 year from now it will be worth a hell of a lot more .
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:02:35
Why is it called the 21 million club when already millions are lost forever . 
Let’s go out on a limb and call it the 15 million club hehe .
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:30:57
You may need to seek legal advice . You can prove you are owner of the bank account that bought the coins from them . 
They have zero reason to doubt you . 
The only positive thing is your coins are there and not going anywhere . 
If I’m you I would send the bank statement showing the money cane from your account that purchased the coins with your id . 
Send a pic of your passport.  Bank statement . You holding them .
@_date: 2019-05-06 21:27:47
He could try to buy it all ?? Hehe
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:08:50

@_date: 2019-05-26 00:13:41
If you don’t !
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:31:43
There are stores of gold all over the world . 
There’s too much Gold . 
His hidden away to keep the price high and stop a market crash . 
There’s plenty of room for Crypto , 
Smart people have multiple stock .
@_date: 2019-05-30 00:20:40
You can afford satoshis
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:25:24
Who is going to jail . Giving out fines is nothing to these institutions.  
I want to see how many prison sentences are handed out .
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:10:33
Congratulations. Your going to have the greatest new year ever 
@_date: 2019-05-02 10:42:19
Oh so isis don’t use money to fund terrorism . Just bitcoin . Stupid article .
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:28:26
If it goes 5x and you decide to sell , 
Why not just sell half . 
And forget about the rest for 10 years .
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:56:58
Let’s hope there’s no war . 
It’s amazing . Crypto currency experts understand wat now . 
Let’s have a nuclear war and the best currency is bullets after that .
