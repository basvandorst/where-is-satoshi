He's about 15 minutes from my place. Anything I can do to help?

Nothing illegal of course.

Anyone notice the similarities between some of the extreme BTC advocates and those religious people (that try to shove their beliefs on others) that we all hate? I do. 
Nobody knows the future of Bitcoin and we're pushing this new currency based on our beliefs that it will succeed and change the world. Of course we're going to make enemies along the way but there's a right and wrong way of handling those situations when they arise. 
p.s. I'm an advocate of Bitcoin but I do my best to not embarrass myself by becoming a drama queen every time some unfavorable news comes out about my precious coin.

any recommendations? I noticed you said there are good sources out there for crypto news but failed to list any.

You really won't have much luck if you're trying to operate within the US or use US-based exchanges. Banks want bitcoin companies to supply them with this information so it is in Coinbase's best interest to collect as much information about its customers' as it can. 
It's called KYC. 
Feel free to use Localbitcoins to meet up with someone privately or an exchange like BTC-e.

Curious as to why you didn't list MultiBit? Should I switch to one of your recommended wallets?

It looks like independent wallets is the first part of that specific piece? Unless he/she updated it.

And by state of your wallet what exactly are you wishing to see? 
 will allow you to take a look at your node and check if it is being seen by the bitcoin network. you can setup email alerts if your node goes down.

coinmap &amp; yelp are two that I can think of

the words are now too close to the top and bottom cutoff. ugh my ocd. thanks though, this edit makes it way more tolerable. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 20:41:16
the uneven spacing of the words from the top and bottom border just kills me.

i've had zero problems with them. when i first signed up for coinbase i made sure to get verified asap. submitted my bank information and once that was all done i bought my first btc. after waiting 30 days i was verified level 2. instant btc until they added the CC feature. added my CC and now i can purchase up to 10 btc instantly. 
other than time (which is understandable) it was a fairly painless process. most people i see having problems are either impatient or trying to avoid sending in documents.

it's your banks which make it difficult not bitcoin
