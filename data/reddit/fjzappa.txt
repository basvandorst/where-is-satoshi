Buy and sell any coin like you bet Blackjack.
Invest 100% of your investment.
If it hits 200%, take out 100% so the money left in all came from the house.  
If the remaining 100% hits 200%, let it ride.
If it hits 400%, take out half, or 200% of the original investment.  Now you have 300% in hand + 200% still invested.
Then let it ride until you get to 800% of your original investment and take out half.
Now you have 700% in hand and 400% still invested.
If this user had followed this strategy, he would have withdrawn $52K to date, and would be sitting on 3.3 BTC, worth another $52K.  He would be waiting to make his next move, selling 1.65 BTC at ~32K.
Personally, my own strategy is to HODL!

So... If I bought a 5GH unit in March 2013, when difficulty was in the 6M range.  
* And it was delivered in October, when difficulty was in the 27M range.  
* I figure that I lost out on 27 BTC worth of mining in that time frame, or $12,000 in USD.  
* However, if I was able to flip the unit on EBay for roughly 2X what I had paid for it.  
* If I had kept it, from 10/1/13 to today, it would have earned roughly 2/3 BTC.  
Can I join the class?

ASIC Design is hard.  Proven to be beyond the scope of a bunch of Kansas farm-boys.

I GPU Mined from March to Oct of 2013.  Sold the cards in October because they were then costing more for electricity than they were producing.  In October.  When difficulty was 1/15 of what it is today.  
When my Butterfly ASIC rig showed up, I sold it on Ebay unopened, because it was also going to be unprofitable.
Mine if you want, as a hobby, but not for profit.  Certainly not with GPU's of any type.

Yes - great idea.  
But who's going to purchase your assets in a war-torn area that you're desperate to leave?  Real estate in such times is essentially worthless, same with your business, your manufacturing plant's equipment, etc.  If you're among the first 1-5% of the population who decides that it's time to go, you're probably OK taking cash or even wiring money out.  Once the soldiers come, nothing traditional has value any more.  
If someone can kill you to gain possession of your stuff, they sure won't be paying for it.
