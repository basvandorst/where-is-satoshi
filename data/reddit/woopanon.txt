I really felt bad for him at first but after reading his messages he seems reaaally not like a kind person. Tells other people are morons and the next sentence is: "Bitcoiners are so bad"

Why is it a pyramid? I mean they are making money from every contract and you lose money - but that is what a business has to do to survive?
Either they are making a fault and they have to close their business or you are making a fault and lose money.

This is like the worst "tip" I ever got. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:26:21
It´s just the truth :D I mean: Bitcoin rising and rising and boom "bitfinex" happens drop 150 USD, then some australian hsit and brexit.

But how to draw the line between Pyramid and Ponzi?
Booking.com lets you book hotels and if you bring affiliates you get money. Is it a ponzi or a legal MLM?
Or how  you differ any other digital business - with no intrinsic value - from a Ponzi/MLM?
And what is the difference between letting users do the marketing for you or buying huge amount of advertising space which gets you users.
It is not easy to draw the line there in my opinion. But I do see your point.

Plus if you google Bitcoin after this documentation you will see that you can buy them.

I don´t think I understand what you want to say.
The difference between MLM and pyramid is that pyramid is illegal because you need new users to earn and pay money. MLM is legal (at least in my country) because you can attract new users but you also earn money by selling/making something (like Hashing Power or Mining).
It is sad and bad that you can´t ROI with genesis-mining. BUT I am way happier with a business which is upfront with their fees, which is pretty transparent and which is successful in Bitcoin business, than a Cloudmining business which is pure scam and which takes the Users Bitcoin.
This way they are more likely to say "my investment in this company was not good" than "fuck bitcoin, there are only scams".

For me it is Buy high and sell low.

Ever had problems with taxes? Or is your accountant managing this?
Also how do you pay someone the exact "Dollar" amount?
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:17:51
In my opinion that is why he is not interested in Bitcoin. Never invest in something you cannot understand is one of his principles.
From his point of view I understand why he does not want to invest and I even think most of the people here (myself too) don´t even understand bitcoin and how it really works (the cryptographic stuff).
So from a point of investor he is right - this shit is highly speculative and risky but man I love it.

Don´t want to sound rude but "lifetime" means only as long as it is profitable (as long as the maintenance fee is lower than the payouts).
And as I said: A business like this couldn´t survive without a business plan.
@_date: 2016-12-31 13:29:59
It is! Especially when you do your taxes (Business) with Bitcoin in Excel.

I am really angry that someone is really giving Onecoin a shoutout, but not angry enough to sign up for finance.yahoo.com :/

Wow, a great list! I haven´t heard from the most of them unfortunately, the only results I got was bitpay and pey... Last time I asked reddit, nobody knew which services to use. Maybe it really is better to just make a (false) statement in the internet.
Thanks a lot again! I appreciate your help.
@_date: 2016-12-31 13:32:28
It is helpful! For taxes, data and math stuff.. and althoguh it seems small "Bitcoin stuff in Excel" it isn't.
Bitcoin is seen as a currency :) yay

Good arguments there.
But I see Bitcoin much more as a store of value than a credit card. As cold storage is really secure I would see Bitcoin like Gold - in a safe. I don´t need to check a safe every 6 months to check if it is still there.
I think it is good what you are doing there because it surely is done in private. I am much more disappointed that you were able to find addresses, because you always hear that this is impossible.
Let´s me rethink how safe Bitcoin really is.
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:32:57
I don´t think it is noble nor do I think that it is not stealing as I stated above.
But I do think it is good that he is checking if the "privkeys" are really that secure.
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:30:34
That is not how the real world works :D If I make a paper wallet for bitcoin I won´t check it till I want to sell. So you are holding it forever till someone is ready to prove it?
