You are probably safe then. Well. Assuming they can recover... somehow...
I had some dollars in lending. I'll probably lose some from the inevitable crash on open. Or all. Who knows.
 There's no safe place, I suffered losses from thieves entering my parents' house, crashes from government rigging values (Argentina's Kirchner government) and now an exchange.
 The best you can do is diversify and don't keep everything in one place. Sadly, even then it migth not be enough, you can reduce risk but never eliminate it.
Oh well. Win some, lose some I guess.

Wow, you are insanely polite and patient. If I were in your place I would have sued them after 2-3 months.

That's more or less what happened here in Argentina between USD and ARS, people were... angry.

I was mostly joking but it is possible to make a profit, technically.
Look here
 7685USD -&gt; 1 BTC -&gt;  380,598.99/46 -&gt; ~8273USD
You have more dollars at the end, of course this is not really sustainable since unless you are a not resident the AFIP (IRS equivalent) will get you eventually. Plus the opportunity to do this is over already...

Of course!
1. Buy bitcoins with dollars.
2. Sell them for pesos.
3. ...
4. Profit!

What I described it's just arbitrage which doesn't last very long. 
Maybe you could start with investopedia, not crypto related, it has the basics about trading, investments, etc.

You can use bitcoins and then the receiver can exchange them at localbitcoins through bank transfers in ARS (this is what I do), there are a couple of other exchanges other than that one but in general they are slow to withdraw or have low liquidity so it would take some time to exchange them without crashing the market if it's a large sum.
You have other payment systems like Xoom that does direct deposits to bank accounts through an intermediary but there's a bunch of paperwork to sign, scan and send from both sides. Don't mention anything about freelancing, job, etc or they might cancel the transfer.
Another alternative is Western Union or direct Bank transfer but they are expensive and need a lot more paperwork than the previous one.
If it's a one time thing I recommend sending BTCs and have him convert them into ARS through localbitcoins. I haven't heard of any issues with that site here (yet).
In general, getting money in or out of the country here is HARD. Lots of paperwork to protect against money laundering and getting money out.
Pretty much all methods use the unofficial rate between USD and ARS to exchange, so he will "benefit" a bit from that (those that don't probably pocket the difference).
Good luck.
