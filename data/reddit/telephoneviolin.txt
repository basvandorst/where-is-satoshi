I'm very new to BTC, and just bought my first little bit yesterday (just a couple dollars worth to test the waters). Is there benefit to investing in BTC vs. just buying stocks? And since I bought BTC very recently, not during a drop, do you predict it will drop, and if so, how low? Would it get back up to over $10,000 like it is now, or possibly more? Just looking for your guess. 
If I'm going to buy more at some point, should I wait until a large drop, and not waste my money now?
Sorry if any of these questions are dumb, but I am very new to all this (including investing in general). I look forward to your feedback!

Ah, that definitely makes sense. Thanks for answering my question!

Hi I'm also new here. This might be dumb question, but if you keep your bitcoin in a hardware wallet that is offline, that would not effect the value of it, right? Edit: Like, if the value of 1 BTC goes up however many %, that would still apply to the BTC in the offline wallet?

Thanks for the great advice! Yeah, I hadn't thought about it that way, in that BTC is more speculative and stocks are based on tangible numbers.
I guess since I'm not exactly "rolling in it", it might make the most sense to buy as much as I can during the dips, and in the meantime, just buy a little bit each month. Sacrifice a $5 coffee or two haha.
Another question; how has BTC managed to increase so much in value? How did it even begin to get popular enough to increase so much in value? I can't think of many things I would use BTC for, with the exception of buying and selling. The only person I know that has actually used BTC for buying something, was when my friend bought some BTC to buy a fake ID with. How has BTC managed to be so successful, despite most people cocking their heads to the side when I mention it?
