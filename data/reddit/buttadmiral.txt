The entity that runs FINCEN kills children you cannot divorce the two. You support the most violent entity on the planet that has killed over 100 children last year, thousands of others, their own people, etc.  If you support the US Federal Govt in any form you support it all because it's impossible to pick and choose. Also I am forced to live/do business with and in the USA. I was born here and forced into citizenship, to leave one has to buy their freedom.  What a free people "we" are.

you don't want to live in a world where you're at the mercy of whoever is strongest? i got some shit news for you that's the world you live in, instead of a single individual(in most cases) though it's groups that force their will, what's the difference? at least we can point to an individual and condemn them, you point at a group and say "well that group is fucking shitty" and that leads to some shit like nationalism and genocides.
as for the self-ownership thing, suicide. just because others can(and do) force themselves on others doesn't mean they own them. what you're talking about is the animal in us that just like a dog cowers to beatings, that fear of your own mortality that keeps you from only taking certain risks.

uh there are "fees" attached with moving your money around between banks and out of the ATM. just because you don't pay them directly upfront doesn't mean they aren't getting their cut on it.  Why do you think savings accounts are near non existent with anything resembling a decent interest rate?  Why do you think they keep inflating and shoveling more money into the banks all the while debasing the money you hold?  You pay for it, you've just pulled the blinders down.

OpenCoin employees have claimed XRP is a currency and others have said it's a stamp. They've claimed it's a bitcoin competitor and claimed it isn't.

It isn't a problem and the more ASICs come down in price and power consumption the easier it will be yo put many of them in general consumer hands in various product forms.  I just don't see the issue and I've mulled it over long before I decided to get into bitcoin.  
if people want to fuck with proof of work, start an alt coin if it's good it will take off and replace bitcoin. If not then oh well. I'd rather bitcoin fail in spectacular fashion so we have things to learn from rather than changing things everytime there's a worry.

How about design a new open sourced mining pool and bitcoin full client that can connect to the mining pool and get a portion of the collected fee of the mining pool for running a "disconnected" full node ?  There are so many things that can be done that this is seriously a NON ISSUE and is only an issue to those who can't fathom how to profit from it.

Ripple is the attempt at closed sourced centralized version of bitcoin. Meh not interested.
@_date: 2013-06-01 13:53:57
Lol ripple is not useful, at best it adds an unnecessary step for fiat to bitcoin and adds a centralized point if failure. Plus they make claims that aren't true. They aren't decentralized and they aren't open source. Their underlying cryptography isn't the same as Bitcoin either.  These are all claims OpenCoin makes about Ripple that aren't true.  Sure you and others spit "but beta!" so? That's even worse then because bitcoin is still beta and if beta is preventing them from open sourcing the gateway code why are they trying to make money off it now? Why not wait until toy have a more complete product for customers/users?  Because they're trying to ride the bitcoin wake by making outlandish claims to back their own version of digital fiat. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:10:14
Terrible excuses here, "omg it's beta!" so is bitcoin, still. It's centralized closed source "crypto currency" *yawn* Ripple is an unnecessary step in Bitcoin to Fiat, it creates a debt based system just like the current one that's fucking destroying the worlds wealth.  Meh idiots who feel they lost out on the bitcoin gravy train are jumping on this one and will soon lose their asses.  How long has Ripple Gateways been out and closed source now?

They should cease taking orders, once they can start ramping up production reintroduce with a higher price point.  Clearly people are willing to pay 5gh BFL prices for a fraction of the hashing power, ie ASICminer USB sticks.  Continuing to take pre orders is the only reason I don't really believe they haven't used preorder funds.  Though glad to see they've shown hashing 50gh unit, the new board is pretty as well.  Can't wait for them to start shipping en masse.

Yes, absolutely why not?  If Bitcoin cannot fulfill the needs, design a new alt coin.  It cannot be "easily changed" it requires either a large consensus or giving up to much power to a small group.  Either way design an alt coin AND COMPETE AGAINST BITCOIN if it is better IT WILL SUCCEED.  As much as I talk shit on Ripple AT LEAST THEY ARE DOING THAT instead of constantly trying to dick with Bitcoin.

well derp the ASIC itself cant, but you could make an entirely self contained system could you not? I bet it really wouldn't cost all that much either, how much do RPI's cost again? 1tb harddrives in bulk? also, to your questions on "how do you validate they are running the full node" uh you write your own fucking client that has said validations in it, derp. Explicitly how it is done is irrelevant, just that it IS possible and the only reason it isn't being done is because either people aren't interested or no one has thought of it.  
We don't need a different proof of work function, what we need is solutions ELSE START AN ALT COIN.  If Alt coin is better, people will use it, if not, fuck off.

So you say, but the whole reason they are hoarding XRP is to sell them for profit to pay for Ripple development. It is a get rich quick scheme. To manu bogus claims like "same underlying cryptography as Bitcoin." lol not.  Ripple isn't even good or easy to use, it adds an extra step into bitcoin to fiat (&amp; vice versa) it also adds more centralization than already exists to that process and on top of it all it exposes users to more potential scams with their shitty debt based system.  Why are some of you even into bitcoin at all if you support basically a shitty digital version of The Federal Reserve system? Because you're trying to get rich and you don't understand how shitty the economics of Ripple are.
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:31:19
then they should stop claiming to be "open source" huh? they should also cease to claim to be "decentralized" because as long as the source code has a single point of failure(OpenCoin) it's centralized.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:23:08
Trust open source software or closed door reserve system? I'll take my chances with the one designed &amp; operated through transparency, bitcoin.

words on paper already exist that "should" have prevented such a thing, except they didn't. adding more words to more paper isn't going to do anything except further obscure the issue, add more bureaucracy to an already overflowing system of bureaucratic nonsense AND make it that much harder for "the little guy" to participate in any form or function.

Except it isn't and not all IOUs are taken by everyone, so how is it any different than bitcoin without ripple? It isn't it just adds an unnecessary step with greater risk for the person trying to turn their fiat into bitcoin. So sure there are IOUs on say MtGox, but I only have to trust them, not OpenCoin and an exchange.  OpenCoin's Ripple is a digital experiment at a central bank and fractional reserve lending, something bitcoin was built to stand against.

There's a learning curve because it actually requires you to think about "money" besides just accepting its existence and it also requires you to be a little more than computer literate.

They had an error that put more bitcoin in your account than was supposed to be there, ie you have 2, but some how the transaction doubled now you have 4.  You must have withdrawn the extra amount and this is the extra amount that they are requiring.  FYI I had something similar happen to me, except it was 10 bitcoin.  I had withdrawn them and sat on them to see what would happen, exactly this happened.  I put them back balance went to 0.  So why aren't you talking about the extra bitcoin you received in the past?  Technically they're not stealing from you, they're just preventing further use of their service unless you give back what wasn't yours.

Eventually bitcoin is something different all together.  Find a software solution that doesn't require this kind of change to better incorporate those features that are currently disabled.

They make a ton of bogus claims like being open source, they aren't. They say it's decentralized, it isn't. They use the excuse that they can't open source it because of beta, but then why can they sell XRP? Hell bitcoin is still beta and it's open source. Intact without it being open source some major bugs may have never been found.  I do not trust OpenCoin because they have been misleading people and have said to mabu contradictory things.  Ripple as far as I can tell makes bitcoin more difficult to work with and the only people pimping it are the get rich quick types that missed out on the bitcoin boom so they're trying to ride in bitcoins wake and swindle the uninformed.

FPGA for litecoin are already on the way and "more expensive" is a relative statement. Bitcoin saw 30+ before any asic hit. If litecoin finds itself in a similar position, money will move in to design them to have that edge. It would be more lucrative a shovel selling business.

What is there to like about it? It brings absolutely NOTHING to the table except it allows those who were late to the CPU/GPU mining game the ability to feel like they're participating in something.  It's like the losers bracket in a poker tournament, no one wants to be there, but they're happy to be getting a possible second chance at placing. Also, don't let anyone fool you with Scrypt being a better way of doing things, it isn't. All it does is open the door to easier 51% attacks by allowing someone with a huge bot net to throw CPU power at it, whereas Bitcoin requires hardware specialization which is much more costly.

imo it's incredibly short sighted to think ASICs are detrimental to Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. I would venture to say they're a good thing and a natural development of the system.  Why?  Because prices come down and they can be thrown into practically any electronic device that's connected to the interwebs to do some hashing.  Completely and utterly decentralizing the system from traditional computer hardware.

Litecoin can be taken over by a botnet cheaper than bitcoin can be attacked with ASIC hardware.

Who owns Ripple?
No one owns Ripple. Ripple is an open source protocol created for anyone to build on top of or use.
right from their page.  that claim is not factual. OpenCoin owns Ripple as they own the code that does ALL THE WORK.  The only thing they've open sourced is the client and the client does practically nothing, gateways in Ripple are everything and that code has yet to be released.  Hence "open source" it is not and it is definitely owned by someone.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:04:51

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:24:14
Those are the only choices because you lack creativity to see what could lie ahead.  Humans have a long history to adapting and if centralization is the weakness, which having 1 exchange handling all of or the majority of transactions is, then some will have to innovate a way to have a decentralized way of exchange or maybe we'll have to change practices.  localbitcoins.com is centralized, but decentralized.  What if there was a shift towards in person exchange?  We don't know, but it seems incredibly naive to pigeonhole all of bitcoin &amp; humanity into 2 simple choices.

Simple, has a QR and address for receiving, shows balance and transactions. Needs the ability to send bitcoins though severely else it's just a nifty little thing.  No blame to the creator obviously as MS is the one with their finger on the button to block things from the market place.  I've been waiting for a WP8 wallet for awhile, is it possible to make one yourself and load it up on your own device?  I haven't even thought of going that route.

I agree it's not so much a women thing, just my personal anecdote.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:20:26
it also adds another layer of anonymity to trade.  we can move the bitcoin around without ever it leaving the address.  no trace in the blockchain of who it went to or why. such offline features are handy and of value if the coin can be trusted.  trust is really why you pay a premium for the Cas coins.

You should really spend a lot more time reading and understanding how bitcoin works if you seriously made this kind of noob mistake/misunderstanding.  If you create a wallet somewhere else, on someone elses server, how do you expect to "hold" the wallet.dat file on your own computer or device?

Why wouldn't you spend? You have extra value that literally cost you nothing. You could spend your initial investment,USD-wise, on whatever stuff inside the bit coin community, helping feed the feedback loop which will increase the value of the profit you kept.  You're not doing yourself any favors by only hoarding a certain amount of coin.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:34:43
What makes you think I or others aren't already looking at a solution like that?  Bitcoin needs less "oo I know what's best for the protocol" and more software solutions built around it or alt coins. Nothing wrong with alt coins

@_date: 2013-05-31 16:06:56
It is a non-issue, ASICs will make it moredecentralized, not more centralized.  If you're really worried about it, design an alt coin with all the technologies you prefer and steal market share.  You're simply a scared child, technologies die(just like people) get over it.  If bitcoin went poof tomorrow, sure it would suck and I'd lose out, but something(hopefully better) would fill the void.  You should be working towards that end instead of trying to control things that are out of your control.

USD is technically already an IOU so you want an IOU of an IOU for your "hard" money.  Sound decision making my friend.  Ripple adds an unnecessary step to go from Bitcoin to fiat and vice versa.  We have multiple exchanges that aren't connected and accept multiple forms of payment.  That's already more decentralized than Ripple is, there is no benefit of Ripple.

1. It isn't even done today, more people die from car accidents than guns in the USA.  It costs the collective "society" billions every year because of these "roads" the Government has built to allow us to travel and who's responsible for everyone being at that sufficient level again?  Seems like a failure. If it's just going to fail WITH Government, it really can't be that worse without right?
2. Uh you can't, are you stupid?  I guess one suggestion I would make is everyone carry a fucking gun, then mugging someone is a life or death situation for the mugger and not just the muggee.
3. "Justice system" voluntary arbitrage next.
4. Uh by flying with those who have the highest level of safety and have the record to back it up.  Flying has gotten progressively worse the more and more Government has stepped in.  It has reached the point where I just don't fly, I'd rather drive to New York from California than have to deal with the TSA and all the bullshit that goes along with flying.  Sure it might cost me more monetarily, but it's fucking worth it.
5. 300 million people, if they have a gun I doubt anyone would invade, but if we're not being coercive assholes, bullying people into do shit why should we even wage war?  Wah wage war, lulz fuck that.  If this is a serious question I've already lost all hope in you.  Fuck war, I don't want to pay for it with the resources at my disposal nor my life.
6. Uh take direct action and help them out?   Don't bitch and moan about it and do nothing, throw money at the problem and hope it goes away.  That's the problem with you religious types, you've got to much faith in your God, except clearly you prescribe to the much more modern religion of Statism, so Government is your God.
7. Uh if it's a good product/service you don't need incentives, it's natural existence is all the incentive needed for its use.  Falsely propping things up creates an unnatural existence which requires further work to create illusions of "incentive".  More coercion because the central planners know best.
8. Direct action, anything short of direct action in this case will not accomplish anything except pointing guns at innocent people to steal their wealth.

OpenCoin is misleading people with Ripple in order to line their pocket books.  There is no way this lasts in the long term.  They claim they are open sourced, they aren't. No argument of "but they plan on it in the future!" doesn't make it open source and they are misleading people.  Not being open source means it's centralized, NOT decentralized, again misleading people.  Joel Katz will probably come around and try to defend the company he works for and he's more than welcome to, but I've gone through the pages, the wiki, all the threads, read everything I could about Ripple and I simply don't get what it does besides add an unnecessary step in between Bitcoin and fiat.  In fact I would go one step further and claim Bitcoin to fiat &amp; vice versa are already more decentralized than Ripple.  There are already multiple exchanges, ran in multiple countries, that take multiple ways of funding with fiat, no single point of failure really.  Sure you can say "But MtGox does 80% of traffic!" well that's consumer centralization due to lack falling back into their own stupid habits. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin or exchanges.

I hear you and appreciate it, it's just annoying to see people go "lol look at chart it is similar" but time frames are different, the velocity in which information is spread is ever increasing.  Not to mention bitcoin is a 24/7 market limited only by its connection to traditional financial institutions/services.  It seems to me counter productive as a whole to give a flying fuck what the chart looks like, unless you're trying to make a quick buck and then you're not really looking at 6m / multiyear anyways.
