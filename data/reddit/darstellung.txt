everything we do in public could be scrutinized. its like saying you dont want to be followed around, you dont want me to listen to your conversations in public, stay home. he should get a life and stop getting in peoples business.  
also many things in this accounts history, I did not post. I dont know who did, but I didnt. Maybe someone else is using my account.

keep btc in my wallet. luckily i wasnt that stupid, btc is falling for six months like a brick. i would have only lost. i sold the rest of any cryptocurrency i had in late january, luckily.  
it is not a vital method to keep btc in your wallet. i dont want to carry that risk.

doesnt matter, it is still personal and you have no buisness going through my shit. 
just because your neighbors trash is on public ground, doesnt give you the right to go through it, you perverted creep. respect the privcay of other

you are playing dumb but let me use another example. I go to the Restaurant with my gf, a public place. you could sit next to us and listen to everything I say. it is legal but it is creepy, get out of my fucking business you creep. get a life. stop interfering with my privacy.

BTC is too expensive. Withdrawing BTC at exchanges cost you about 5-10 dollars. kraken charges 5 dollars.  
if I want to buy something at the DM I use BCH because kraken only charges 8 cents for BCH withdrawls. To withdraw your BTC from DM costs you again 8 dollars. The fees are too damn high. With BCH you pay at dreammarket only some cents. 
I dont like bch but I like low fees.
