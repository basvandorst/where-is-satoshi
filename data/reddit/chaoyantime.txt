o, i'm not tracking the 100 list, but at the top, I'm recording daily changes in the percentages of each grouping. But you're right, that makes sense that someone pumping bitcoin would open a new account to do it. Less attention.

Good post. Got caught up in the fanaticism the first couple months that I started. That fanaticism is dangerous, because you either blindly believe without accessing the reality of bitcoin's technological shortcomings (and therefore are of no use in fixing it), or become disillusioned and emotional when the price switches in the opposite direction.
Cool heads make for more stable markets and allow the community to progress forward in creating a truly usable currency, whether that be btc or another. Debate and discourse is fine, name calling and slander is counterproductive and a reflection of your insecurities and desperation over having picked "the right side"

Agreed. If money is usefully for anything other than bare necessities, (rent, food, clothing, education) it's useful in taking care of those around you. I get so bored so quickly with the trinkets I buy for myself, but when I buy something useful for a loved one, I'm so much more happy. While I'm a complete free market individual who believes less government control is better, I think a personal goal of contentment and more posts promoting less greed will not only encourage an environment where bitcoin is a useful tool rather than a get quick rich scheme, but also prevent tragedies such as this from happening too frequently.

Nah, I have a friend who knows ppl who were doing it so if I had to I guess I could funnel it through him.  I'm just wondering about how they're thinking
You have to have a face to face interview with a rep in Korea apparently to get a bithumb account btw.

Likely an exchange

hahaha. I think the sad thing is that I've seen the original post and it still didn't deter me.

ok, I get your point, but its not technically true. There are a some people who play poker professionally and day trade professionally for a consistent profit. They do it by the numbers, I have a friend who plays online poker and has been for around 8 years now. The amount he bets, the time he bets, its all just probability for him, even across a spread of different opponents, it's all evened out. These people are one in a thousand, but they do exist. I'm not even talking about the professional poker players that get to the professional poker tournaments. These guys sit in front of multiple monitors playing 10 online games at once with programs that spit out probability. They grind like 60-100 games a day for 10 hr shifts. Over a hundred rolls of a dice, you will roll a 6 one sixth of the time. He showed me his profit spreadsheet once, and over literally thousands of games and over 8 yrs, its a linear increase, for him its all based on probability, the numbers win in the end. 
 I know another guy (and many like him) that has been day trading for 15 years, and with him, the wins and losses over a vast number of trades every day come out to be a very consistent net gain.
That being said I agree with you, what you say is the basic reality for the vast vast majority of us. But sometimes the definition between gambling and a safe bet are blurry. For example, one could argue that just having bitcoin at all is betting on the supposed outcome of bitcoin. You could say that you've looked at the numbers and decided that because market capitalization for global currency far exceeds crypto, and because you believe that crypto is superior in many ways, it will end up with the market cap and increase in value, but you don't know for sure that Bitcoin will be the one left standing in the end. At best it's an educated guess.

yup agreed. Instead of trying to earn a couple hundred dollars in bitcoin over the last couple of months from my measly fraction, I could have spent more time finishing my thesis and graduating, getting a real job, and then putting more money into bitcoin. Or yup, I could have at least done something fun.

Because of this one drunk guy from a long time ago that I should have listened to
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:00:09
Lol, true. But I get his point, whenever you put in, it's a better store of value
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:38:42
Kind of, I really didn't put too much in, I have a very small income from tutoring and TAing at school. It was mostly just being greedy and trying to grab even more than I need. And then after that the typical gambler's remorse that makes you think "If i can just win back what I lost, then I'll stop". Well at one point, I did win back what I lost...then I got super confident and then lost it again.

True, I think I did learn a ton during the last 2 months. But the biggest lesson for me was the addiction/impulse trading was really really bad. I think in the future, when I have more self control and after I graduate and find a job, I'll invest what I can afford to lose, and trade with an even smaller percentage of that
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:16:13
Also, that being said, what you just said is exactly what I'm going to tell my future children. Since playing poker for money is gambling for 99.999% of us, I'm just going to tell them that playing poker is gambling and gamblers will eventually lose. It's what I learned and I'm part of the 99.999% for whom it definitely holds true 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:23:14
actually I do get that. I mentioned it, with a nod towards addiction. Some people are professional gamblers and can make money doing it. The other 99.99999% of us can't.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:15:08
Yeah, I'm joking, but the point is that Im losing a lot just waiting for my paycheck
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:23:14
I totally get what you're saying, but the reason why I don't consider both my poker player friend and day trader friend gamblers is not only because they're crazy smart, but also because they make very very very conservative moves. They make "safe bets", but that's also why they aren't among the richest in the world. The safe bets have the lowest reward. It's also why they aren't well known, the gains are pretty modest. Anyhow, idk why I'm playing devils advocate against my own post, I'm done with gambling cause I'm dumb and there's no way trading isn't gambling for a dumb person.

when you don't spend your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:43:52
As in the total volume that I moved was 37x. Like if I have a total of 100 dollars, but I bought and sold the same amount around 37x, then I moved a total of 3700 dollars. Pretty easily over 78 different transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:53:19
I agree, which is why i'm mainly looking at coinmap.com to look at the growth of shops and venues. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:23:47
The rational part of my brain agrees. This post was intended to be more about an addiction rather than what I think Bitcoin is/should be
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:58:16
That's why my freaking paycheck can't arrive soon enough... I'm considering going for payday loans, just to exchange at a lower price 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:58:11
boooo korea and taiwan. boooooo. hope you had your fun. I never try to wish ill on anyone, but I hope enough people get burned from the hike that they realize this is just a BCH bubble
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:55:52
I didn't buy with bitcoin. I just spent usd on a gaming pc instead of getting into crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:32:51
I'll always remember when my friend told me to buy 4 years ago. And I said yeah maybe. And then I bought a computer instead. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:33:00
Sadly my paycheck isn't for another week
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:49:14
I try to eat as little as possible. Buying bitcoin should be part of the weight watcher program
