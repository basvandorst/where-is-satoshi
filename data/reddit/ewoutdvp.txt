I'm aware of that quote. I agree with that quote. Bitcoin *is* attractive to the libertarian viewpoint. If I were asked about Bitcoin and Libertarianism - like Satoshi was before giving that answer - I would have said the same. That does not make me a libertarian, nor does it make Bitcoin libertarian. You know what else is attractive to the libertarian viewpoint? Lots of things. Gold. Guns. Lots of thing. Doesn't make any of these things libertarian.

I don't think that Bitcoin is broken, it's just not perfect - not yet anyways. Which actually makes sense, since Bitcoin isn't even finished yet, it's literally still in beta.
Will it one day be perfect? Maybe, maybe not. It should be noted though that Bitcoin is not competing with perfection. Creditcards, paypal, or even fiat currency as a whole are not perfect either.

I'm not sure what you mean.
Bitcoin substitutes much more than a currency. A payments network (like Paypal) is one of them. Smart contracts (eg. proof of ownership) would be another. And since you can program crowdfunding, "the crowd" (instead of a bank) can issue credit...

Yet these same anarchists almost certainly use fiat money every day. Their criticism would hold some ground if at they didn't use money at all right now. But they do, so they should at least switch to a type of money that's not controlled by the state. Being anarchist and all that.

First of, I think it's a lot of fun. Even now.
Secondly, a lot of people who prefer to have a little bit more fun were kind of dismissed by the community at large. The mods have a big contribution in this, with their ban on memes. Right after that happened, Dogecoin got launched, and the bitcoiners that prefer to have a little bit more fun drafted away towards dogecoin. Now that is the fun cryptocoin.
Personally, I think it was the wrong move by the now-dogecoiners. Dogecoin *is* fun, by you shouldn't let a bunch of asshole bitcoiners dictate what is and is not allowed in @_date: 2014-01-16 15:15:17

You actually can't get a chargeback on your dollarbill. Bitcoin is like cash for the internet. This has advantages as well as disadvantages. Biggest advantage being that it is cheaper and faster, while there is no need to trust a third party (like a credit card company.)
However, third party services (like PayPal) will certainly be build around Bitcoin as it gets more traction as well, making reversibility an option. 
Also bear in mind that many countries don't have access to services like credit cards or PayPal at all. For them, Bitcoin might very well be the only option for online and cross-boarder payments.

Sorry, but this is kind of a dumb question. None of us were born with bitcoins in our wallet, all of us had nothing to gain from its success financially at some point. What happened? We chose to make sure that we did.
Hence, you seem to have our motivations upside down. You think we're positive about Bitcoin because we have a stake. This might be true from some, but it's certainly not true for many of us. It's the other way around. I'm positive about Bitcoin *therefore* I have a stake. Wouldn't make much sense if I didn't, would it?
The precise reason I have a stake is because I'm "voting with my feet". I truly believe that the corrupted financial sector is what's wrong with our world today, and the only way to change that is to put my time, energy and money in a new and better system.

As a well-of citizen in a first world country who doesn't really care about being fucked in the ass by the financial sector, nor cares about making a potentially life-changing investment, there probably isn't much incentive to switch right now.
Since bitcoin is programmable money, new innovations that enable all sorts of cool stuff will probably be invented soon, though. At that point, the question is not whether to use bitcoin or credit card, since you'll *only* be able to do it with bitcoin.
Back in 1993, people were asking the same questions about the internet. Before Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and all of that was invented, it didn't really seem like all that much. Sending a fax was much easier and faster than sending an e-mail. It's the same for Bitcoin right now. It's a very young and developing technology, and we're just getting started. Give it some time.
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:56:08
He actually published the White Paper months before he mined the genesis block. Anyone else could have wrote the code in the mean time. Nobody did.
After that, Satoshi asked people to help him out, in order to help keep the network alive. Hardly anyone did.
You make it sound as if Satoshi kept his brilliant plan for himself for a while, which is pretty much the exact opposite of what happened. It's not Satoshi's fault that most people only became interested once the price rises.

1. Source? Didn't think so. It's theoretical bullocks, and available empirical evidence of price deflation pretty much debunks this myth. Computers would be a fine modern-day example; it's better to wait longer before you buy a computer since you'll be able to get a better one... yet we all spend massive amounts of money on computers all the time. There's also plenty of historical evidence to counter your friends argument. Deflation can be bad, but mainly in a debt-based monetary system. Which Bitcoin is not. Empirical evidence: 
2. This would depend on your concept of "value". As someone who believes in the subjective theory of value, I don't think anything in the universe is a "store of value". I don't think gold is very pretty, and I can't use it for anything else, hence, gold is completely worthless to me. *Except* that I can fairly assume that others *will* value it (subjectively) in the future. I don't see why the same couldn't be true for Bitcoin. Probably not right now, we're still in a very experimental phase. But over time, sure.
How is the Fed going to buy back dollars, by the way? Buy them back with what?
edit: I should probably add that there is a difference between monetary deflation and price deflation. Bitcoin doesn't really suffer from the first.

Not *really*, a degree is just a piece of paper, but I still kind of  think that "left-libertarian" is a made-up term. Maybe by left-leaning bitcoiners who didn't want to feel left out? I don't know.
Moreover,  there's no point debating semantics, and we're all pretty much on the same page here. I just wished that people would stop labelling everything bitcoin-related as libertarian. Not because I want to ostracise anyone, but because I don't think it's accurate terminology.

That's not what regulation means.

These are great and the single most important questions to ask (not even close to moronic though).
I don't think that wealth is a problem, unless it comes at the expense of others. And that's exactly what the current monetary system does, it's literally impoverishing people at the expense of the wealthy few:
In a bitcoin-economy, I don't think wealth would come at the expense of others. That's why I'm in. (I don't hate wealth, I hate poverty.)

I am familiar with game theory, and I think it's very interesting and by far the best argument for anarchy.
It only works without an established number of 'meetings'. If we know for a fact that we are only going to meet once, or even twice or a hundred times, it doesn't hold up.
In a society as big as ours, I think the second one might be more true than the first. There's so many people out there in the world that you could easily go a lifetime without ever having to deal with someone twice.
I'm kind of hoping that the internet will offer a solution to this problem in some way. But I haven't heard anyone tell me this solution yet.
And it also doesn't hold up if one person is stronger than the other, does it? If I have a gun, and you don't, then fuck cooperating. You better give me everything you've got. Right?

This does not mean that Satoshi was libertarian or anarchist. (And if so, which one was it then?)
The first quote means that he does not like oppressive governments. But neither do liberals, for instance. And I'm not speaking about the present-day fascists that try to pass themselves of as liberals, I'm talking about actual liberals, such as Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill or the founding fathers.
The second quote means exactly what it says, which isn't that Satoshi was libertarian himself. If I bake a chocolate cake and I tell Mike that Mary will enjoy that cake, that does not mean that I am Mary. It also doesn't mean that *only* Mary will like the cake, or that I made it especially for Mary. It just means that I have a good idea of what my cake is, and what Mary will like.

Why would he "cash out" at all, if he can just spend the bitcoins? That would actually be a much better option for himself, since selling his stash would crash the price, hence shooting himself in the dickhole.
Claiming that bitcoin is some type of get-rich-quick scheme to me sounds like saying that Microsoft is a get-rich-quick scheme. Yes, some people got rich quick, but their product is verifiable legit and useful, so it doesn't really make sense to call it a scheme...
Also, of everything I have read of Satoshi, I really do think he was an idealist. For example, in the early days he wasn't keeping Bitcoin a secret or anything, he actively asked people for help to keep the protocol running. That doesn't make sense if he'd have wanted to keep all of the coins for himself.

You're doing fine, there's no rush.
Most people need to hear about bitcoin once at first. Then they'll hear about it later once again. Then it's actually on the news. Then they'll have another customer ask about it. That's when they'll actually type it into google once. That's when they become interested. And then, finally, when yet another customer asks about it, is when they'll actually take steps to implement it.
You don't need to sell people to bitcoin - bitcoin sells itself. All you need to do is tell them about it. Let them know there is demand for it. In fact, selling it and being pushy about it makes it seem like a pyramid scheme to most people, which is clearly counterproductive.

Bitcoin should be considered a long-term investment. (Or better yet, not an investment at all; use it as you would use "regular" money!) It will either succeed, in which case you are now part of a revolutionary concept of which future historians will write complete books. Or it will fail, in which case you are part of a facinating experiment. Either way, there will be *a lot* of turbulence along the way.

You keep using words like 'law', but I don't understand how that word can have any meaning if no one can coerce me into following that law.
If there is a law, but no way to make people live up to that law, what is the point of having it at all?


Although I'm not really criticizing anarcho-capitalism, you are right. I don't see the difference. I don't care whether somebody puts me in a cage because it is the rule of the land or not. All I care about is that I don't want to be put in a cage. Any ideology that includes the possibility of people putting other people in cages is not my ideology.

I think that your argumentation is the wrong way around. Although many or even most AnCaps like bitcoin, that does not mean that bitcoin is anarcho-capitalist. Bitcoin can *help* the anarcho-capitalist case, sure, but even that does not make bitcoin itself anarcho-capitalist.
A lot of anarcho-capitalists might like guns. A lot of anarcho-capitalists might be subscribed to Does that make guns anarcho-capitalist though? I don't think so; a gun is free from politics. Some political parties or perhaps even ideologies might support guns, but that does not make a gun political or ideological. A gun is a neutral object that can be used by multiple people and for multiple purposes.
I think that the same is true for bitcoin. Even though most AnCaps might very well love bitcoin, I'm pretty confident that most bitcoiners are not AnCaps, and I think bitcoin itself is definitely not.
As far as I care, you are absolutely free to tell anyone you like about anarcho-capitalism, I even encourage you to do so. I'm also perfectly fine with you arguing that bitcoin helps the anarcho-capitalist case, and even with you telling people that bitcoin *is* anarcho-capitalist. But I do not think that the 'official' bitcoin sub-reddit should present it as such. The mods *could* do it of course, they have the right to, but I think that it is in bad taste to use such a widely visited page to advertise your own ideology through something (bitcoin) that you did not create.

No problem.
Here's another thing to consider. Even *if* Bitcoin turns out to be some type of scam, the invention still stands. This means that we could just swich to a new type of cryptocurrency if we need to. We could all agree that bitcoin is flawed, and agree to launch bitcoin 2.0 on this and this date. That way everybody would have a fair start.
Moreover, the fact that we *could* do this, and the fact that Satoshi and other early adopters are almost certainly aware of this fact, should be a warning to them to not fuck shit up. *They* are the ones that stand to lose most, not us.
Hell, if we really wanted, we could *even* block Satoshi from using his coins. I assume that something drastic would have to happen before the network agrees on such a measure, but it *could* be done.
*We're* in charge. All of us. That's the beauty of an open source network managed by consensus.

The dutch created their own democratic governments, and they still exist today (apart from the national government).
If you don't believe that I want to keep the bitcoin protocol absolutely 100% free from government interference I find that quite insulting.
We've been over the tax-issue already. I think that the government can tax people as long as they can use violence.
By the way, how is anything in the bitcoin protocol stopping the government from asking for your private key right now? That to me seems like it has nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol, only with your government. [Edit: I meant to say public key, but I guess that the same is true for your private key even.]
That's actually pretty much my point. You can make bitcoin as anonymous as cash (and I hope that we can), but the government will find a way to tax it - they do and have done so with cash.

First time users don't go to message boards discussing how the internet could be even better. Same goes for most other examples. Going to the moon was impressive, but how many people were actually making it happen?
Don't forget I'm not only speaking about programmers here. I'm speaking of all of the bitcoin-shows that are popping up, websites that are being made, lectures that are being given, and even the simple fact that almost every single person that gets involved uses his brain to think: "could this actually work? why/why not? what does it lack? could that be fixed?" *That's* a concerted effort.

Your claims are partly true at best. Some people receive their money. It just takes a long time. Whether MtGox is running a fractional reserve (aka scam) is up for debate: 
Personally, I don't think so. They are a young and new start-up dealing with enormous cash-flows in a sector that's not exactly bank-friendly. Trouble was to be expected.
Regardless, it would be very healthy for the bitcoin ecosystem if exchanges get much more decentralized, and people use localbitcoins a lot. Both of these things are already happening.
Coming from a poker background, I think that honest platforms (Pokerstars) will survive and turn out much more profitable in the long run than fractional reserve platforms aka scams (Full Tilt Poker).

I got a question for you. How do you feel about the other sort of elasticity of bitcoin? The more I think about it, the more I am fascinated by the elasticity that comes from its divisibility?

Ok so if I want to buy a house, I would have a voluntary contract with the seller right? So, no coercion. If I would want to buy security, same thing.
What if I choose not to sign such a contract though? With anybody? Wouldn't that mean that I could do "anything at all"? So what is the difference then?
Also, what makes such a contract binding? In our current society, the rule of law makes contract binding. If somebody breaks a contract, the rule of law will (or should) help you out, and enforce the contract.
If there is no rule of law, what is the point of having a contract at all, with anyone?
@_date: 2013-07-29 10:29:08


Are you suggesting that laws are pointless because people don't abide to them anyways? I think that there are plenty of law-abiding citizens. Some people will ignore the speed limit on a road, but most won't. Some people will evade taxes (and do so right now), but most won't. Especially if you are a store-owner, and they could shut you down if they find out you are evading taxes.


...but they could harass citizens. And I am pretty convinced that they will. I am not saying that is good or bad, but I am saying that I expect them to do exactly that.


[Are you in banking?]( :)


[Yes!]( This is an important reason why I am aboard.
Here's the thing though. You have already agreed that bitcoin in itself will not make for a libertarian society. We will also need freedom of information, for example. And I think we need even more than that. We need the freedom from taxation/harassment, we're probably gonna need no gun laws, etc.
Let's say that freedom of information is A, bitcoin is B, freedom from taxation/harassment is C, en no gun laws is D. Therefore, a libertarian society is ABCD. (There might be even more to it than that, but you get the point.)
Since B(itcoin) does not automatically provide for AC&amp;D, bitcoin will not automatically provide for a libertarian society. (We've agreed on this, right?)
Moreover, it would be perfectly possible to have B without AC&amp;D. Some people might like a society that looks like BEFG. Or ABDG. Or BDLP.
There's also different reasons why people would like B(itcoin). (B1, B2, B3 &amp; B4 if you will.) Some people might like a world much like the one we have today, but without banks. Some people might like a world much like the one we have today, but with a neutral world reserve currency. Some people might like a world much like the one we have today, but want to be able to freely trade with a salesman from Kenya.
And although it is true that you can't have B1 without B23&amp;4, you *can* have B1 without AC&amp;D, and not care about B23&amp;4.
B(itcoin) definitely fits the libertarian cause (it's part of ABCD), but it fits many other causes as well (such as BEFG).
There are many many reasons to like bitcoin, of which a lot have little or nothing to to with libertarianism. Yet, some libertarians have now claimed bitcoin for themselves, because they fail to see that B is only a part of ABCD, and/or that B fits into a lot of other letter combinations as well.
We should all just agree that B is great, and leave the rest aside. If you want to go for ABCD, that's absolutely fine, go for it. But I'm more of an ABDE kind of guy, and someone else will prefer BGLP, and that should be fine. Any one of us can promote bitcoin as they wish, but not on behalf of the community, because the community is not monolithic.

So you've got dollars "stuck" at MtGox yeah. If you want to get the out (quickly), you need to first *buy* bitcoin, transfer these coins to some other exchange (or broker, or whatever) and sell them over there.
If a lot of people do this, a lot of people obviously want to buy bitcoin at MtGox. Not because they want bitcoin, but because they want to get their dollars out. This drives the price up. It also drives the price down at other exchanges a bit, since these get a lot of Gox-customers looking to sell their coins for dollars.
edit: I'm not sure why the price is similar right now. There's probably a lot of newbies using Gox without even knowing they have problems. That's my best guess anyways.

Bitcoin is not a way to make money. Bitcoin is money.
According to some, bitcoin is superior to the type of money we currently use, and will therefore become the most important currency in the world. If this happens, you will feel like a fool selling at 400$, since one bitcoin will buy you a mansion and guarantee you a nice retirement. At the very least.
If it does not, it will probably fade away entirely over time, as some crazy hype people will look back at laughing.
Most people agree that either one of these outcomes will be the end result of this experiment. There's not really too much room for a middle ground.
You are therefore asking the wrong question. The question shouldn't be about profit. Instead, you should make an assessment on the odds of bitcoin becoming a worldwide succes. If you estimate the odds of bitcoin becoming huge as 1%, you should probably invest 1% of your net worth into bitcoin. If you estimate the odds as 100%, you should invest 100% of your net worth. And the same is true for 0%, of course.
Lastly, why not spend your profits - buy something nice - instead of selling?

It seems pretty clear to me that there was more to it for him than just trying to establish a better way to process internet transactions. Most notably, it seems that he was bothered by the monetary/banking-system.

Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of

Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled

holding their own.
I do agree that we should keep the speculation on his motives to a minimum though. If Satoshi didn't say it, we shouldn't assume it. This would include linking him to specific political ideologies. 
He did, however, acknowledge that Bitcoin is attractive to the Libertarian few-point. This doesn't make him a Libertarian of course (I can acknowledge the same thing without being a Libertarian) but I think it's save to assume that he at least had sympathy for Libertarianism.

Paul Krugman dislikes bitcoin, but that's not because he is a liberal, it is because he is a Keynesian.
The reason he thinks Adam Smith would 'hate' bitcoin has nothing to do with bitcoin being free from government interference, or with Keynesian economics, but solely because of the mining process (which would be a waste of energy). This has hardly anything - if anything at all - to do with liberal ideology though. More like a footnote.
Since bitcoin is actually pretty darn efficient, I don't think Adam Smith would hate bitcoin at all. He probably wouldn't think it is absolutely perfect, but neither do many of us. (I for one kind of worry about the blockchain getting bloated as more people start to use bitcoin. Does that mean I 'hate' bitcoin. *Of course* not.)
Neil Irwin's article has nothing to do with liberal ideology, nor does he claim that it does.

I think that this is the main error in your reasoning regarding governments: every time you say 'governments', you really mean 'my government'. For instance, cannabis is legal in the country where I live. Seriously, you can come by and we'll smoke a joint right in front of a police officer. Hell we'll ask him for a light while we're at it, or we'll ask him where we can buy more. He'll be happy to tell us.
This is just one example, but in a functional democracy, we could change *anything* if we get enough people to agree. I don't think that it's 'governments' you should be after, it's 'the US government', or 'government corruption'.


Well, you can. The 'social contract' is such a case. You can *disagree* of course, and if that's the case you should absolutely tell people why and see if you can get them to agree with you. You could/should perhaps even see if you can defend yourself from them, particularly if you think that the social contract has been broken. But I don't agree with your statement that you "cannot make a case for why government is legitimate". It can and has been done.

Let me clear something up. Just because I'm not convinced by something, doesn't mean that I reject it. I'm rather [agnostic]( when it comes to many things. (That's also why I specifically said "*At this time*, I think... etc.")
This also means that there is always convincing to be done if that's what you're after. I can't guarantee you that it will work - and more often than not it won't - but I think that I'm always open to new ideas.
I also didn't mean to portray my criticism specifically to anarcho-capitalism.
(Several ideologies *do* seek to abolish conflict, by the way.)
Why would one type of coercion be ok, and another not? If I'm being coerced, I don't really care who does it. In fact, I think I would rather be coerced by an institution which I can democratically influence, perhaps even run for office myself - at least that's something.

Shaking the Bitcoin Believers
By PETER THAL LARSEN
So much for China’s willingness to tolerate financial innovation. Regulators have barred the country’s banks from trading Bitcoin, while denying the pseudo-money legal status and cracking down on anonymous users. Though China has stopped short of an outright ban, the move dashes hopes the country might allow start-up currencies to exist alongside the official renminbi.
China’s crackdown is by far the most decisive by the world’s financial regulators to date. That’s probably because enthusiasm for Bitcoin appears to have been greater there than in any other single country. Data from online exchanges suggests that China has in recent weeks accounted for around a third of global trading volume. For a while, Chinese Bitcoin buyers were also paying a significantly higher price for their virtual stash than users outside the Middle Kingdom.
Though China has not made Bitcoin illegal, the directive from the People’s Bank of China severely limits its potential uses. It is a “virtual good” without legal status. Financial institutions are banned from trading it – a significant step in a country where banks will accept copper and rubber as collateral for loans. Moreover, the People’s Bank of China has taken steps to limit the anonymity that makes Bitcoin appealing as a means of exchange in illicit deals — or as a way around China’s capital controls.
The regulatory assault undermines the narrative that Bitcoin is in the vanguard of a global shift toward new, computer-generated forms of money. With that new monetary age paradigm looking shaky, the virtual asset has lost a good portion of its speculative appeal. The price of Bitcoin on BTC China, the country’s leading exchange, fell by about 20 percent following the ruling.
Devotees will still insist that government restrictions cannot undermine an asset that was devised as an alternative to state-controlled fiat currencies. It also remains to be seen whether other countries will adopt the same hard line. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s true believers are having their faith tested.

The passion? I believe that the current international monetary system is leading us to war. And I don't like that. This book (and even the short description of the book) explains why: 
Likewise, I don't think that a state-run currency is really a problem as long as people have a choice. Bitcoin gives people that choice.
I also don't like banks btw, I believe that their mode of conduct is criminal, and would be very happy if I could do without. So that's another reason to like bitcoin.
I don't mind any political discussion. In fact, I'm quite fond of it.
Others can and should promote bitcoin however they wish, but I think that they should do so individually, and not on behalf of the community.

Come on... If you don't have a painting, you'll be just fine. If you don't have food, you'll die. If you are not able to see or acknowledge this difference there is no point of discussing any further.


Come on... It's not about the corn. It's about food in general, which needs scarce resources like land, (fresh) water, labour, commonly oil, etc. I just used corn as example. If this is something you genuinely do not understand there is no point of discussing any further.


First of all, you cannot monopolise all paintings. Literally everybody can make paintings themselves. If all paintings are taken, you can even just make your own painting. You cannot make your own oil. You can not make your own land. Etc.
Second, you don't need a painting to stay alive. Again, if you are not able to see this difference there is no point of discussing any further.


Yes it does.


There's actually two meanings of scarcity: relative (your definition) and absolute (there isn't enough). 
So yeah, I know this. And that was not the point of what I said - *at all*. It's not about scarcity, it's about whether you do or do not need a product to stay alive. Again, if you are not able to see this difference there is no point of discussing any further.

Ownership is not a God-given right, it is a cultural agreement. Many cultures have had many interpretations of ownership. There is no objective way to define what is "yours" and what is "your neighbours".

I haven't got the time to read all of the links you supplied right now, but I will say this.


That's not a social contract, that's the *breach* of a social contract. And I agree. Your government has indeed breached the contract. Years ago. And as John Locke himself would say: 
"Or else when by the Miscarriages of those in Authority, it is forfeited; upon the Forfeiture of their Rulers, or at the Determination of the Time set, it reverts to the Society, and the People have a Right to act as Supreme, and continue the Legislative in themselves, or erect a new Form, or under the old form place it in new hands, as they think good."
The government is not acting in the interest of the people? Then you have the right to ignore them/revolt/do whatever the fuck you want. The contract is breached.
I definitely think that you are simplifying the truth v. falsehood issue. For instance: you are an individual. That is absolutely true. But you are also part of a group. That's also absolutely true. (Maybe that group is 'humanity' or even 'earthlings', but there is no denying that.) Forget all of the rest, this is the central difference between liberalism and socialism. This is where all of their ideas stem from. And I for one belief that they are both based on logic, and they are both true. You are indeed an individual, yet you are also a part of a group.
Utilitarian, is not a bad label, I can definitely live with that.

I'm not trolling, but I am ignoring a lot of what you say because I think it's irrelevant for the discussion. I don't want to discuss labels (for the exact reason DeGrasse Tyson explained, btw), I don't want to discuss semantics, and I don't even really want to discuss my own ideals. I want to discuss anarcho-capitalism, and that is what I am doing.
Here is the main thing I don't understand. What is the difference between anarchy and anarcho-capitalism? Because it seems to me like there is no difference at all. Anarcho-capitalis**ts** have a different idea of what such a society would look like, because you are all about private security firms etc., but the system itself would look exactly the same: no system at all. If people choose **not** to hire any private security firm, which would entirely possible, they could just do whatever the fuck they wanted as long as they have the biggest muscles. They would have absolutely no obligation to listen or adhere to any sort of mediator. They could even enslave other people if they wanted to. 
I don't understand what concepts like 'law' and 'ownership' are worth if there is no authority to enforce these concepts. Contracts and ownership papers etc. only mean anything because we have rule of law, judges, police and jail to enforce them. Otherwise they would be nothing but pieces of paper. And why would a piece of paper stop me from taking that nice car that sits on the driveway of that house you happen to live in? (You would probably refer to these as 'your' car, and 'your' house.) I am curious to your ideas on this.

*"All anarcho-capitalists and libertarians love bitcoin"*
First of all, this is [not]( [true]( But even if *most* anarcho-capitalists and libertarians love bitcoin (which might or might not be the case), that shouldn't matter, because **that is an upside-down argument**. Basically for the same reason that drug lovers or Christians can't 'make' bitcoin a drug-currency or a Christian-currency. Just because bitcoin fits a certain cause, doesn't make it a part of that cause. Most libertarians like gold, but that doesn't make gold libertarian. Gold is neutral. Many other people who are not libertarian like gold as well. And many other people like bitcoin. Bitcoin is *neutral*. (And as seen above, the majority of bitcoiners actually seems to not be libertarian or anarcho-capitalist.)

I would not argue that the Declaration of Independence is a-political because it is made out of non-political paper and ink. Neither would I argue that bitcoin is a-political because it's made of bits and bytes. 
But we can study the writings of the founding fathers, and see that they were extensively discussing liberal ideology during the years leading up to the American Revolution. This can be found throughout many pamphlets, letters, the Federalist Papers, etc., as well as the declaration itself, and the constitution and the Bill of Rights.
As for bitcoin, however, all we can really go by is this one remark by Satoshi Nakamoto, and I would argue the text in the Genesis Block. But these remarks don't prove that he made bitcoin in order to reduce the power of governments* and escape government-run banking systems** . He *might* have, but for all we know he was just fucking around. Or, slightly more realistic, he hated the corrupt and too-big-to-fail banking sector, but not necessarily governments. (Much like Max Keiser, for example.) *All* that he said is that bitcoin is very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint. Which is absolutely true. I have acknowledged this myself. But that doesn't mean that bitcoin is *itself* libertarian. Neither does it mean that Satoshi was a libertarian.
Gold is also 'very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint'. But does that mean that gold is libertarian? I don't think so. It's the other way round, libertarians like gold. But many other people like gold as well. And many other people like bitcoin.
As for the other people building and spreading bitcoin... are you sure that they are all libertarian and/or anarchist? Even today? The Chinese government seems to be putting in the effort to spread bitcoin, surely they are not libertarian or anarchist? (edit: and so does Rick Falkvinge, the founder of the Pirate Party and member of the European Parliament. He's not anarchist or libertarian either.) The Bitcoin Foundation is probably the closest thing to an official representation of these people building and spreading bitcoin, and AFAIK they claim that bitcoin is not political...
Don't get me wrong, though. Like I said, I have sympathy for libertarians as well as AnCap's, and I've got mad respect for those that have put in the effort to bring bitcoin where it is today (I only heard about it some six months ago). But I simply don't think that bitcoin is libertarian or anarchist, nor do I think that the whole or possibly even the majority of the bitcoin-community is (today).
*edit: And even if it did, libertarians and anarchists are not the only ones that seek to reduce the power of government.
**edit: I would argue that it's the other way around. The government does not run the banking system, the banking system runs the government. [Exhibit A]( [exhibit B]( [exhibit C]( Although this is a whole other discussion, it is a pretty good example of how different people (you and me in this case) have different reasons for liking bitcoin. And there is nothing wrong with that.

Ok so let me respond to that.


So first of, you make this sound very easy. It's really not. People have thought about creating some kind of digital money for decades, but nobody was able to figure it out. The main architect of IMB has said: "I though about ways to make this work, but concluded that it was impossible. I was wrong." (Or something to that tune; [video](
In essence, Satoshi has solved the Byzantine General Problem, which is a well know and very old mathematical problem (or: problem in computer science).
Therefore, your remark is kind of like saying: "I'm an engineer and want to make some money. I develop a jetpack."
It's really not that easy.


First of, I don't see a problem here. If you invent a jetpack, you deserve to get rich (imo). If you invent digital cash, same thing (imo). Secondly, it seems like Satoshi has not touched most of his coins since he mined them. And to be prefectly clear, Bitcoin would have died if he didn't mine them.


I don't mind this either. They took the biggest risk, hence they deserve the biggest reward. (I'm not one of them unfortunately.)


He absolutely did not make up some grand backstory. He has posted a couple of ideas regarding money, banks, and government, but he was no Tolkien. He has even admitted himself in one of his e-mails: "I'm not good with words."
Moreover, his criticism of fiat money absolutely holds up, and he's not the first to espouse these problems. It's just that he is the first to actually invent a great solution for them.

Absolutely. I even doubt whether strong people with a lot of weaponry would have themselves hired as security firms in the first place, since I'm pretty sure that it would be much more profitable to just use these weapons to rob and coerce people.


Exactly. That is exactly what I think would **and has** happened. That is why we have governments right now. But if we'd start all over again, we would probably get the downsides of government, but not the upsides. We would have to fight for all our rights all over again. No public schools, hospitals, voting rights, etc.

Also, this doesn't answer my question. For some reason, the speaker starts thinking at the point where each individual is subscribed to private security agencies. These security firms will deal with each other, etc. That is what would constitute 'law'. What if I choose *not* to subscribe to a security firm though? What if I assembled my own army instead? In that case, there would be no law *for me* to adhere to, and I *could* do whatever the fuck I wanted, right? Including pillaging.

*"The mods can do whatever the fuck they want."*
First of all, I can't help but think that this is an enormously ironic remark coming from anarchists who claim to want to decentralize power.
Second, yes, they can do whatever the fuck they want. I know this. That's why **I'm not telling the mods to do anything. I'm asking them**. I am trying to have a civil discussion. I love bitcoin, and I want it to succeed. And I believe that it should be perfectly fine for me to voice my discontent on any issue, regardless of what the mods, the early adopters, the majority, or anyone else thinks about that. I believe that is the only way that any community can progress and move forward.
I know you are on a [mission]( and I respect that, I know you mean well. I totally agree that bitcoin should never ever be centralized or controlled by any government. I'm also cool with 'educating' people on anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism; if you guys want to do that, by all means, go ahead.* And if you guys want to evade taxes, hey man, have at it. I really do hope we can make(/keep?) bitcoin as anonymous as cash. But **I don't think that bitcoin should be presented as a libertarian and/or anarcho-capitalist currency on a widely visited webpage**. If anything, bitcoin should be presented as what it is: a *neutral* currency.
*If the objective is to get people interested in anarcho-capitalism I would however suggest some of you (not you personally) to be a little less hostile to the 'statists', and a bit more patient and welcoming to differing opinions. The attitude I come across here sometimes really only throws people of anarcho-capitalism. But that's just my two cents.

That is correct, I don't think that you can or should classify bitcoin as a private currency. No private entity is in control of bitcoin after all. There is no bitcoin-company, nor is there a CEO of bitcoin.
Neither do I think that there is any government department responsible for bitcoin.
I would probably classify bitcoin as a public currency myself. The software is publicly managed. The blockchain is publicly owned. Etc. It's a currency by the people, for the people. But I don;t think this is very important, because I'm not trying to convince you that bitcoin is a public currency, I am making a plea for neutrality.
About the Fed/dollar: what if some government (any government) would enforce the legal status of bitcoin? Maybe Iceland, maybe Egypt, maybe Zimbabwe, maybe the US. Would bitcoin then all of a sudden seize to be AnCap? Even if nothing is changed in the code, at all? Would it all of a sudden become a statist currency?
My opinion: no, it would not. Bitcoin is not Ancap right now, and it won't be 'statist' if it gets adopted by a government. It's a neutral protocol. It can be used by AnCaps, it can be used by governments, it can be used by drugdealers and it can be used by my grandmother. But bitcoin itself is (and should be presented as) neutral.

*"Bitcoin is libertarian or anarchist because it will make it unable for the state to collect taxes."*
So yeah this might be bad news for some, but **bitcoin can be taxed**. It's not even that hard to do.
Also, if people want to evade taxes, they can use cash right now. In fact, it's much harder for a state to tax cash. So bitcoin is not really that revolutionary in that respect. (Still, people do pay taxes, apparently. People payed tax even when cash was the only money in existence.)
Gavin Andresen gets payed in bitcoin, and he pays taxes over it ([source]( and there is even a section on the 'myth' of tax evation in the [bitcoin wiki](
It would also still be perfectly possible to have sales-taxes, and lots of other sorts of taxes that don't directly concern the money you own.
Please note that I am not arguing that it's a good thing or a bad thing, but merely that the reality is that freedom from taxation is not baked into the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2013-07-28 20:38:37
How long has it been since we as a society pay electronically? Like, back when the banking system was not used by the state to monitor the movement of money, how long ago was that? Thirty years? Forty? Were all governments libertarian before that time? Hell, did we have any governments? This is a rhetorical question of course, because we did have governments, and they were not all libertarian.

I would agree that a lot of Litecoiners are in it because they feel like they missed the boat with Bitcoin.
However, a lot of the Litecoin-haters do so because they fear that their Bitcoin-investment might make them slightly less rich, or a slight bit later. Just as useless.
edit: To make it clear, I basically think Litecoin is a great supplement to Bitcoin because it is... not Bitcoin. Monopoly's are bad, and if Bitcoin becomes some type of monopoly, it will end bad. I want this thing to end good, in which case I think competition and alternatives are good. If it slows down adoption and/or "steals" value from Bitcoin... so be it.

*"The politics are baked into the protocol, because it decentralizes power."*
Although bitcoin does decentralize certain types of power, I don't believe that this makes bitcoin itself libertarian or anarchist. This is mostly because **the decentralization of *some* power is not the same as the decentralization of *all* power**. Even though a Muslim might want to outlaw pork, that doesn't mean that he is a vegetarian.
Some people might think that it is a good idea to decentralize the power of money creation for instance, but do like their public schools, or public hospitals, and are fine with some taxation for such causes. Which is absolutely not in discord with bitcoin, or the bitcoin protocol, or anything like that.

Was this meant to be a reaction to my comment? Anyways, I'll respond.
I'm actually not as much of an anti-Keynesian as many bitcoiners are per se, but the reality is that the bulk of money that has been printed 'to keep up with economic growth' has not been invested in the *real* economy for decades. Instead, the big investment banks have been investing in *each other*, and each others financial products - often fraudulent financial products.  This does absolutely nothing for the real economy. Literally nothing. That is not investing, that's speculating, or, more accurately, creating a bubble. A risk-less bubble for these bankers, moreover, because they will get bailed the fuck out when it pops. *With taxpayer money.*
Although Keynesian theory is not as bad as many bitcoiners make it seem (I think), it is nothing but a theory. The *reality* is that this theory has been abused by a very very small elite to get very very rich.

The irony is that your snarky comment* actually proves my point. [Some dude]( who happens to be a mod of adding a banner is apparently considered proof that bitcoin is political.
Some dude who happens to be the mod of adding in the sidebar probably has the same effect on newcomers.
Besides, I, for one, have never said that bitcoin is not political. It's just not necessarily libertarian or anarcho-capitalist. If bitcoin is political, I think that this is primarily because it entails economic policy (an inelastic money supply/free market for currencies/?). Not ideology. It seems to be enourmously hard to grasp for some people, presumably because of the few political parties in the US, but (economic) policy and ideology are separate concepts.

I like what Rick Falkvinge (the founder of the Pirate Party who put all of his savings into bitcoin) [has to say on this issue.](
TL;DR: Tax consumption.


I disagree. (Figures ;) ) [This TEDx talk by Rob Wijnberg]( will explain why.
TL;DW: I judge ideas on basis of usefulness, not on basis of 'truth'. (edit: and I think that a stateless currency is a very useful idea, while I think that anarcho-capitalism is not.)


Actually, most Western states are based on the premise of the [social contract](


First of all, I could just as easily argue *against* the state when debating an (actual) statist. (And I have done so in the past.) Just because I argue for something doesn't mean that I believe it to be true. Although I will probably believe that it is useful. Again, see Rob Wijnberg's TEDx talk.
Second, I would never call myself a statist (or an anarchist) for much the same reasons why Neil DeGrasse Tyson [doesn't call himself an atheist.](
TL;DW: Just watch it, it's only three minutes long.
As for anarcho-capitalism, I'm still not convinced  of the usefulness of the idea, because I think that it will result in a step backwards instead of forwards. It will lead to less freedom, and more coercion. [Stormcloudsgathering has made a pretty good video explaining why.](

Northern Europe is leading in bitcoin adoption. You can order pretty much any type of food online in Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. Scandinavian countries are consistently at the top of the list of active nodes (relatively). There's a whole neighbourhood in Berlin where bitcoin is used almost everywhere (Kreuzberg). There is probably no country in the world where it is easier to buy and sell bitcoins than in The Netherlands. The Danish payment-processor bips.me is one of the biggest around. Not to mention that bitcoin.de, bitstamp.net and btc-e are all European.

So I'm not allowed to be part of the bitcoin community if I am not a libertarian or an anarchist? What if I *am* a libertarian or an anarchist, but I don't believe that bitcoin is inherently, and shouldn't presented as such? What if I hate governments and dream of an anarcho-capitalist world, but still don't believe that bitcoin was specifically designed to be for AnCap? May I be a part of this community then? Perhaps speak up sometimes, even?
What if the majority of readers here isn't libertarian or anarchist? [This]( poll shows that only 37% of bitcoiners are libertarian or anarchist, while 45% of users is left-of-centre.
Will you and your minority impose your own ideology on the majority then, while the majority won't be allowed to vote, or speak? Political dissidents will be either silenced or banned to yeah? Right, I get it now. I am very sorry and I apologise great leader, I will be obedient from now on.

I'm not sure, probably differs for different periods in time. But I'm not sure.
Fractional reserve lending doesn't make for a debt-based monetary system though. In a debt-based monetary system, *all* currency is created as debt. In a non-debt based monetary system, banks would still be able to create debt, but it wouldn't be systematic. It would be an agreement between to consenting adults, who are both aware of the risks involved.
Fractional reserve lending would still be possible with bitcoin, but bitcoin itself is not issues as debt. (It's mined, and has value on its own - although opinions on that issue differ of course.)
Does that make any sense? I'm sorry, I just came home and I'm a bit drunk right now. (4AM over here.)

Dear American,
Most of the world is already a terrible place for most human beings. They are already in tears.
The 300 richest people on earth own more than 50% of all the wealth on the planet. This is not due to hard work, or even luck, it's due to massive financial fraud, which they're able to pull of because they or their friends can literally create money out of thin air. It's also not harmless, since that wealth comes at the expense of others.
Moreover, due to our debt-based monetary system, our economy *requires* growth, regardless of the environment, or human well-being. This is obviously not sustainable, and a collapse will happen at some point in the future for certain. If anything, bitcoin can save us from that financial apocalypse, not cause it.
It's the current system that is rigged. If you have an even better alternative, I'm all for it. Until that time, I support bitcoin.

Many don't think that it is. Libertarian or otherwise.

I think it's the other way around.
Most politicians are good people, and they joined politics because they wanted to change the world for the better. But they got stuck in the debt-based system. Just like everybody else. This leaves very little room for change.
Bitcoin is a way out of that system. They want that as well, they just don't realise it yet.
Perhaps you've seen Oliver Stone's Nixon. There's this scene where he meets a bunch of youth, and they give him shit for Vietnam etc. He then realises that he was just like those kids twenty years prior, but once in office he simply wasn't left with much choice - he had to act like a dick, that's what the system required him to do. (Stone's message, not mine - although I agree.)
Once they realise that bitcoin has such a great future to offer compared to the make-belief downsides of terrorism, they will want to embrace it as well.
Nobody is out to get us right now, nobody is our enemy, everybody realises that the banking system is shit at best, or downright evil at worst. Including most politicians. They're on our side on this one - or will be.

What constitutes as other peoples stuff? Can you own slaves? History shows us you can. Can land be owned? Several nomad tribes will disagree with you. Can you own intellectual property? Some people think you can, some people think you cannot.
What constitutes as "other peoples stuff" (hence the stuff "you don't get to use") differs from culture from culture.

That is, makes no sense at all. Bitcoin is a currency that is first and foremost a Christian experiment that hardcodes some radical religion in the computer code. Those opinions are more religious than Christianity itself:

[Not the mark of the beast.](

Will you use violence to protect what you consider to be "yours"? What if other people don't agree that it is in fact yours?
Ownership is not some God-given truth, it's a cultural agreement, which in fact differs from culture to culture. It used to be ok to own slaves in many cultures, even in Western culture. Many nomad tribes will argue that it is impossible to own land. Right now some people will claim that you can own intellectual property, many others will claim that you cannot.
If some nomad tribe sets up camp on the land you consider to be be "yours", are you gonna use violence to send them off? If so, you are using coercion to force your cultural agreement onto others, and you would in my opinion be no better than the so called "statists" all of you despise so much.

Personally I would like to see all of the non-bitcoin communities removed, since they are, well, non-bitcoin communities.
Sure, Austrian economics and bitcoin go hand in hand, as do Libertarianism and bitcoin, but so do many many many more things. Why isn't in the sidebar? Silkroad is why bitcoin is what it is today. Why isn't A lot of preppers surely like bitcoin. Why isn't A lot of them hate the central banking system? Hell, why isn't on there for the same reason (more or less)? Since bitcoin is money, and money is used for almost anything we do, you could end up including almost every subreddit in the end.
I think it's best to just include directly bitcoin-related subs (like bitcoinmarkets) and nothing else.
edit: I only mentioned anarchism and libertarianism because I think they might scare people away more than any of the other subs. Many people like to affiliate themselves with ideologies and/or political parties, and will refrain from investigating bitcoin if they see that it is a libertarian/anarchist concept, even if they might really like bitcoin if they did. (And I don't think that bitcoin is a libertarian or anarchist concept, it just happens to be a good match, like many things are with bitcoin, as described above.)

All you probably read is libertarian books and articles, listen (or watch) to libertarian talk show hosts, and visit libertarian forums, and then take everything you read for gospel. (And anybody who doesn't agree for an idiot.)
Let me explain this as simple as I can.
You are an individual. That is 100% undeniably true.
But you are also part of a group. Whether you like it or not, that's also 100% undeniably true. That group could be humanity, or perhaps even earthlings, but you are undeniably a part of a group.
Liberals ("libertarians" you would call it in the US) view the world from the first truth.
Socialists do so from the second.
Neither is wrong, the difference is one of perspective.
I'm familiar with the homestead principle by the way, I even mentioned it in my post. If you'd read the very first sentence of the article you linked to, you'd see that it *immediately* links to "ethics". [Ethics]( are social constructs.

I am assuming that your experience in Spain was mostly in Catalunia. So first of, I'd argue that the anti-establishment mentality is very much an anti-Spanish sentiment. Which isn't very strange, given the history of the region.
Second, all of the Socialist-Catalan flags hanging out of windows didn't strike me as particularly libertarian, nor did the mentality of most people I met. It's more of an anarchist sub-culture, isn't it?
Yes, both like their freedom, but it's not as if that makes both of them libertarian. At least, not according to my understanding of libertarianism.
AFAIK "libertarianism" is the modern-day terminology for classical liberalism, which has a very strong emphasis on personal freedom from state interference, hence negative freedom. "Negative" not being my opinion, but terminology: 
edit: This is the type of freedom that is primarily (but not exclusively) valued in the USSA.
Progressive liberals care far more about positive freedom, however. This would be the kind of freedom that enables peolpe to actually enjoy their freedom. This includes health care, maternity leave, study funds, and stuff like that. I would **not** call these people libertarians.
edit: This is the type of freedom that is primarily (but not exclusively) valued in Northern Europe.
And then there is the socialist/anarchist type of freedom, which primarily focusses on freedom from exploitation - any type of exploitation. This is what you refer to when you mention the anti-corporate spirit in Spain.
(For instance:  )
edit: This is the type of freedom that is primarily (but not exclusively) valued in the "Latin" countries, eg. southern Europe and South America..
Now, I don't care which type of freedom you, or anyone else prefers, but I don't think you should lump it all into "libertarianism". And neither should bitcoin, nor the bitcoin-community be lumped into the libertarian camp.
It annoys me that a lot of libertarians involved with bitcoin seem to have a very black-and-white worldview. You're either with them, and you love freedom (*their* kind of freedom, of course), or you are not, and you are a statist-totalitarian who is here to centralize, regulate and eventually kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:10:28
I don't think that taxes will always be a fact of live - in fact, in hope not. But I don't think that bitcoin will change that either, although it will almost certainly force the taxing mechanisms to change and adapt. And I don't think that's necessarily bad, because I don't think that tax equals theft by definition. The reason *why* taxes are raised matters, and the issues on which tax is spend matters as well.
I absolutely agree that your position is based on logic, but I hope that *you* understand that a lot of 'statist' and socialist positions are based on logic as well - just a different type of logic, which mostly arise from different concepts of justice or ownership. There is no divine concept of either of them.
Some people will for example argue that ownership of land is grounded in the willingness and ability to use the land (perhaps for farming), while others will argue that it's simply impossible to own land - nobody created it, it's just here, much like air or the sky. The same is true for the state. Some people will defend the state on basis of the social contract, some people will say that such a contract is invalid and/or non-existent.
This is all based on logic, yet we can't have both concepts in our society without conflict. I certainly can't dictate who is right or wrong, I can merely choose which concept I find most fair, or desirable. And I'm rather agnostic on many such issues.
I've actually tagged you as 'AnCap who knows what he's on about' (a lot of you don't, and yes, a lot of 'statists (which I don't consider myself to be) don't either). So yeah, I've actually experienced it as a breath of fresh air.

No, what? I'm not talking about fractional reserve banking. (Which, by the way, *is* a lot harder to do if you don't have a central bank backing up that credit. As is the case with bitcoin.)
Our whole (fiat) monetary system is based on debt though. All money in existence is issued as credit (=debt) from the central bank. That's what it means to have a debt-based monetary system. Fractional reserve banking is another issue. Somewhat similar in some aspects, but not the same.

1. I'm sorry but this makes no sense, and AFAIK there is no empirical evidence for it - quite the contrary. The bitcoin-economy is proving you wrong on this issue *as we speak*. *Of course* you can make money in a deflationary economy. And if you can make money, you can make money by investing.
2. It's a terrible example, because Japan has a debt-based monetary system, much like the rest of the world does right now. Bitcoin does not. Nineteenth century America would be a nice example. The Americans had a deflationary currency for most of this century, in an economy that was not debt-based, and they saw *unprecedented* growth.

The Chinese have been calling for a neutral world reserve currency for years - one that is not controlled by states. They like bitcoin because it challenges the dollar.
Comments like these have often been met with ridicule in this thread, but the Chinese were probably quick to recognize bitcoins potential - precisely because of QQ-coins success.

Property rights aren't a metaphysical god-given truth. They're a social construct more than anything else. Your car is your car because everybody agrees that it is: nobody else will even think about driving it. Even if you have a document to "prove" it, that contract is nothing but a social construct: a piece of paper (much like fiat money btw). The car is not a part of your body, it's not written in the stars that it belongs to you, it's just something we all agreed on. And that's fine by me. Somebody produced it, you did some labour to be able to pay for it. Fine.
But land isn't produced by anyone. Land is much much older than even the very first life happened on earth. Instead, it was at some point claimed by somebody who decided that others couldn't use that land. Almost certainly using violence, but even if it was done without violence, it was taken (perhaps "stolen") from the public domain.
I don't really have a problem with that as long as there is enough land for everybody to use. But there isn't. So that's where in my opinion property rights end.
Libertarians argue that you have a right to the land if you work it or whatever, but that's not written in the stars either. That's a social construct - whether you like it or not. Many cultures - past and present - don't acknowledge that land can be owned, and belief that it should be shared by anyone.
(And even working the land is a weird social construct. What if I want to work that same land? I can't because I was born in the 1980's and all land was taken by then? What the fuck?)
Yet if you start to use the land a libertarian claims is his, then all of a sudden *his* social construct is more important than anybody else’s, and the non-violence principle will in all likeliness go right out of the window.
Capitalism is a superb system in many aspects of society, but not in all of them - not for everybody anyways.

You'll basically make the deal online (on localbitcoins.com) after which the both of you will meet up IRL and make the actual exchange. This would involve him bringing his laptop and pressing some buttons, and you bringing some cash. The bitcoin(s) will the move from his account on localbitcoins.com, to yours. It's probably best to meet up in a public space, like a bar.
(I should probably add that I have actually never done this myself. I have used localbitcoins.com, but only for wire-transfers. Hence, this is how I assume it will proceed. You could use localbitcoins.com for wire-transfers as well, of course. In that case you will want to pick someone who has a lot of positive feedback from other users.)

Lots of proponents of bitcoin like bitcoin for all sorts of reasons.
As for flat tax, did you actually read the article? It couples a flat tax based on consumption with a basic income; it's the combination I like.
Would I weep if my state dies for lack of tax revenue? That would depend on what replaces it. If we can find a way to organize ourselves without a state, there would be no need for it, would there? I'm not convinced by the argument that the free market will solve everything though.

Ok, so you meant to say 'private', not necessarily 'private institutions'. That's a pretty big difference if you ask me.
But moreover, nothing is stopping governments from using bitcoin.
(And on a sidenote, the same is true for dollars. Private companies also use dollars to trade, and private individuals use dollars to buy and sell goods.)


I'm not sure if a foundation is the same as a private institution, but even if it is, it doesn't matter, because the bitcoin foundation is not bitcoin. I'm not sure what banking and other financial institutions have to do with it?..


Is this a fact? How do you know that governments aren't mining bitcoin? They are definitely not barred from doing so...


Neither are private institutions doing any of these things.


I strongly disagree. It's an open-source currency, created by volunteers, managed by volunteers, for whomever wishes to use it, including private institutions, individuals *and* governments.
This is exactly my point, bitcoin is (and should presented as) neutral. Anyone who wants to use it, can. *That includes governments.*
There was even a talk on bitcoin neutrailty at the last bitcoin conference (organized by a 'private institution') if you're interested:

I agree, and that's precisely why libertarians should stop claiming that bitcoin is a libertarian currency.
Bitcoin is about as much a libertarian currency as it is an [islamic]( currency, or an [occupy]( currency, or many many other "types" of currency.
Yet because libertarians claim it for themselves, dumb journalists at the Guardian write it up, and people who might otherwise be very exited about bitcoin are turned off. As far as I can tell that shouldn't make anybody in favor of bitcoin happy.

My source (the relevant literature) is [this book](
I still don't think that it matters though, because we are not discussing my ideals, and I didn't say that either anarchy or socialism are my ideals.
If I remember correctly, you thought that I specifically rejected anarcho-capitalism and was in favor of other ideologies because anarcho-capitalism doesn't abolish coercion (and others do). What I actually said though was that I was not convinced by anarcho-capitalism because it doesn't abolish coercion. I didn't say anything about other ideologies. It's as if I said that Obama is black, and now we are discussing whether or not Tiger Woods is black. It's completely besides the point.
So lets drop it, ok?

No I actually can, you worded it splendidly. It was "advertised as communism". In order for the proletariat to not rise up and demand actual communism (common ownership of the means of production), they where fed propaganda telling them that communism was fact. Or that it would soon be.
But it was not. The means of production where not commonly owned at all. They were owned by a small elite. That is *not* communism - at all. It's *totalitarianism*: the state owns everything and everyone.

@_date: 2013-07-26 13:13:50
Well, first of all, I'm sympathetic to a lot of anarcho-capitalist ideas. I'm just not fully convinced by them. There's two reasons for this.
1) I don't believe that coercion will cease to exist if the state is abolished. Coercion might cease to exist is *everybody* turned anarcho-capitalist, and I encourage you to make this happen, but I doubt whether that is very realistic. Likewise, if *everybody* turned communist, coercion would cease to exist as well. This is probably true for most ideologies, even fascism. The reality as I see it is that people will always have differing ideas, and different interpretations regarding concepts like ownership. For instance, some people will believe that you can own land, but some other people will think that that is an absurd idea, since land is much older than humanity. Nobody has created it, it's 'just there', much like air, or the sky. I believe that many African tribes as well as Native Americans held such beliefs, for instance. Such conflicting concepts will probably always lead to actual conflicts, whether there is or isn't a state - unfortunately.
2) Bear with me here, but I think that you could very well argue that we are living in an anarchist world *right now*. The state is nothing but an illusion. You can't touch the state, or see the state. You can touch and see politicians, you can touch and see documents like constitutions, but these merely represent the state, much like the priests and the Bible merely represent the church. There used to be a lot of people that believed in the illusion of the church (not the building; the institution), and today there are a lot of people that believe in the illusion of the state. But that doesn't make it 'real'. You are free to see through this illusion, and do whatever the fuck you want. Sure, at some point people with guns will probably coerce you to act a certain way, but that's really just a conflict of concepts. And as explained in the first point, I think that that is exactly what anarchy looks like.

I'm not sure whether I completely understand you marriage analogy, but libertarians and anarchists are not the only ideologies that don't want to regulate bitcoin. The Chinese government seems to be totally fine with bitcoin, and the Pirate Parties in Europe are as well. These are just two examples I can think of from the top of my head. Neither are anarchist or libertarian.
I'm assuming that you are an American, but I'd like to remind you that bitcoin is not. There is a very good chance that Satashi was not either.
I know that you guys are presented with a false choice between the Democrats and Republicans (a false choice *you* are probably aware of as an AnCap), but I can assure you that there are not only more than two, but even more than three or four political parties in the world, and many of them want all sorts of different things.

I appreciate you pointing out there's several "types" of libertarians. I'll return the favour and point out that not everybody who dislikes (some) libertarian principles is a Democrat (with a capital D).
I think that your "two party" system is one of the biggest frauds in human history, the ideological differences between the Democrats and the Republicans are often smaller than the ideological differences that exist between politicians of a single party where I live.
But let me reassure you, there's not only more than two, there's even more than three political flavours in the world. We have - like - eight political parties in parliament, and all of them have a differing mix of ideals. Libertarianism is not the only alternative.

The reason we can't, is because **we don't know**. Sathoshi's [remarks]( regarding politics are extremely scarce, and I don't think that any of them prove that he adheres to one specific ideology.
Although the first remark does suggest that Satoshi favoured at least some freedom from government interference, he specifically mentions “a new territory of freedom”. This does not necessarily mean that he believes that government should have no power whatsoever, or that states should be banned out of existence. Again, he might very well have had the territory of money creation in mind, but not necessarily the territory of taxation, or schooling, for instance. Many people who are not anarcho-capitalist or libertarian favour a reduction of governmental power over money creation – it really does not necessarily make you a libertarian or anarcho-capitalist. (And the power of money creation is really just one example by the way, I could certainly think of more.)
The second remark absolutely does not prove that Satoshi was libertarian. It proves that he had a good idea of what bitcoin is, and what libertarians like, but that's all. Excuse me the slightly childish analogy, but:
If I bake a cake and I tell my girlfriend that the neighbors will like the cake, that does not mean that I am one of the neighbors. It also doesn't mean that *only* the neighbors will like the cake, or that I baked it especially for the neighbors.
Or: if a muslim proposes a bill to outlaw pork, and he tells his colleague that vegetarians will like that bill, that does not mean that he is a vegetarian (although he might be). It also doesn't mean that *only* vegetarians will like the bill, or that he drafted it especially for them. It just proves that he had a good idea of what his bill was, and what vegetarians like, but that's all.
Third, Satoshi's entry in the blockchain implies that he had issues with the current banking system. This is obviously not reserved to libertarians or anarcho-capitalists either.
Also, if Satoshi was not a single individual but a group (like many think) it is very well possible that this group did not act in exclusive accordance to a single ideology. The founders of the Pirate Bay, for instance, include both a social-democratic idealist and a rather right-winged dude who was basically just fucking around for fun.
Lastly, you definitely can't claim that Sathoshi was *inspired* by libertarian or anarcho-capitalist ideals without any proof to back it up. Doing something that libertarians or anarcho-capitalists like doesn't mean you were inspired by them.

That's pretty accurate, except for the "by first concentrating it into the hands of the state" part. That was Marx' perceived strategy, but has little to do with socialism in and of itself.

This might or might not be true within the US, but again, bitcoin is not American, and reddit is visited by many non-Americans.
Outside of the US, **it's simply not true**. The European Pirate Parties actively endorse bitcoin, and the Chinese government (communist in name) seems to do the same. There might be many more parties out there.

I haven't got the time to read the New York DOT study atm, but I'll take your word for it for now, and I must say that that is interesting.
I don't think that tax is necessarily unethical, it depends on the circumstances. And I know for a fact that many people - including many bitcoiners - agree with me. (And a lot will disagree, and that's fine.)
I also don't think that bitcoin will keep the government from collecting taxes, because I don't think currency gets taxed at all. People get taxed. So, it's probably best if we just make bitcoin happen, and then we'll see; that's something we can definitely both agree on.
Since you are so certain that bitcoin will inevitably lead to anarcho-capitalism (or was it libertarianism?), wouldn't it be better to remove the sidebar subs anyways, in order to attract as many people as possible? Including those that would initially be put off by these ideologies?
(btw, I actually *am* upset that is not giving equal time to every political ideology - or rather, that the mods are censoring certain information. What is relevant should be for the community to do decide through voting. I guess I have a wrong perception of reddit then?)

Yes and they created government to govern it. I believe that these "Waterschappen" were the very first democracy's in modern western society - apart from some experiments in Athens and Rome of course.
The Waterschappen still exist today, but the people who created them don't. It has therefore evolved into an actual democratic governing system, including taxes. And I think that sounds absolutely fair.


I agree. (So apparently we can at least agree that we won't agree ;) )
I think that it's circumstantial. In some cases the (rights of the) community are more important than the  (rights of the) individual, and in some cases the (rights of the) individual are more important than the (rights of the) community.

Fine. Now lets take another example. Lets take something that people don't want (like a painting) but *need* (to stay alive). And lets take something that is not abundant, but scarce. Most notably land, but we could also say oil, or perhaps [aluminium](
Lets say oil. Out whole economy is oil-based. Not just cars, but factories need oil, farmers need oil, powerplants need oil, etc. Therefore, the price of oil is of major influence on the price of almost anything. If oil is cheaper, everything gets cheaper, and the other way around.
All oil is owned by a handful of people though. These people, moreover, decide on the price before oil even really hits the market, and they decide how much oil should hit the market. In other words, it's a cartel.
I think that the price of oil is too high. It doesn't *really* reflect market value. So. How do I go about now, how do I produce cheaper oil?
@_date: 2013-08-31 10:06:35
Hi mate, here is my suggestion. 
Return to your future, and change the fact that land is regarded as ownership. Land is much older than any human being, and the only reason that it is and can be owned in the first place is that it was stolen from the public domain at some point in history. Make the ownership of land public again, and all your troubles will be over. You could probably manage the land in some decentralized way - or something. Either way, I'm absolutely sure you are all smart enough to fix that issue (which we did not create) in your time, while we solve our problems in ours.
Oh, and if for some reason the majority of people don't agree with the way bitcoin owners handle their bitcoin, create a new crypto currency, and swich en masse. The network effect will do the trick; that's how *we* did it!

You are mistaking "most impressive concerted effort" with "most impressive thing humans have ever accomplished". There's a pretty big difference though.
Bitcoin has 4 million downloads. Lets say it has 4 million users as well - seems fair. (Some have downloaded it more than once, some use online wallets instead.) Of those 4 million, how many do you estimate are really into it? Like, how many actually care? How many *want* this to work? Perhaps three million? Two million? One million? I can't imagine it being less than that, so lets say one million. All of these one million people must have at least thought about it then. They must have considered the pro's and con's, potential problems, possible solutions, etc. If even for one hour. That's one million man-hours already, right of the bat. (And I feel like that's a conservative estimate.)
Of those one million people, how many are actively thinking about bitcoin on a regular basis? Like, at least an hour a day? 100.000? That would be another 100.000 man hours every day.
And then there's even a whole lot of people, like at least thousands, who spend *a lot* of time thinking about bitcoin, working on the protocol, but also websites, video's, articles, etc.
As for the moon. Surely a lot of people where involved full-time. But if you weren't involved full-time, you weren't involved at all. People must have surely felt like: "Gee it would be cool if we could land a rocket on the moon and have someone walk up there", but that's as far as it went. Surely hardly any of these people were actually trying to figure out ways to make it happen, nor where they writing about it etc.
I agree with the last sentence though.

Yeah this has to be one of the biggest problems with  bitcoin.
It's one of the main reasons I think we should Litecoin around. The way it's set-up there are almost certainly less whales in Litecoin, and the mining process is much harder to centralize. Kind of how silver (used to) balance out the "gold-whales" (governments and bankers) in the 1800's, and helped to keep the market liquid.

Most of your argumentation seems to be based on two false assumptions.
1. People won't invest their money when they use a deflationary currency.
I don't think this makes sense. Most people would rather have 12 bitcoin then ten, right? Even if 10 bitcoins will gain in value, 12 of them will gain in value as well. So if it is a good investment, people will still make it. And people are indeed investing in all sorts of bitcoin projects. You might want to take a look over at for example.
Hell, I just invested in a Litecoin miner the other week myself, with my appreciated litecoins. The fact that they appreciated in value gave me the chance to, and I expect to make a profit, which I look forward to.
2. Deflation will lead to a deflationary spiral.
This is not backed by empirical evidence: 
The only time this happened, was (prior to) the great depression. But that was *monetary deflation*: prices fell because money became more scarce. And because these were uncertain times, people did prefer not to invest.
This is not the type of deflation bitcoin has to offer though; read this post: //
edit: I might add that monetary deflation is a risk in a fractional reserve banking system in particular. Bitcoin doesn't rely on fractional reserve banking. Hence, it is a *solution* to monetary deflation.

Bitcoin is not a way to make money. Bitcoin is money.
According to some, bitcoin is superior to the type of money we currently use, and will therefore become the most important currency in the world. If this happens, all of us will be "dollar-millionaires". Of course, being a millionaire won't mean as much as it does now, since dollars won't be valued the same.
Instead, the riches might be called "bitcoinairs" -&gt; people who own a whole bitcoin. Or something like that. Who knows.
To answer your question: most newcomers don't understand what's going on here, and see bitcoin as a way to make a quick buck in fiat. That's fine by me, but I personally do believe they will be sorry for doing so one day.

We already have a one-world currency. Right now. It's called the US dollar.


Crypto-money is a *solution* to this problem, since if bad comes to worse, there's always litecoin, zerocoin, whatevercoin. Note that I am *not* endorsing these crypto's right now, but they do exist, and we could choose to use them at any point in the future if that is what *we* want. Bitcoin is not a one world currency. It *breaks* the monopoly of the current one world currency.

But if I choose not to join some private security firm, there is indeed no accountability, no rules and no regulations for me, correct?


This seems to me like anarcho-capitalism in a nutshell. "We don't know how to solve these problems, but the free market will." I'm not buying it - sorry.


By whom? What if I'm not a member of some private security firm? What is my "slave" isn't either, because he is poor, and can't afford that? Who will prosecute me?


How so? Liable to whom?
If BP would have bought the Mexican Gulf (which would probably be possible in an AnCap society), it would have been fine? None of our business? Despite the environmental damage? Why would BP care about the environment? That's not a part of their business model?
By the way, who should BP buy it from? How do they get to acquire the Mexican Gulf?


No but firms will claim that monopoly as soon as the government is not stopping them from doing so. That's the point. This is another thing AnCap's seem to blatantly misunderstand. Yes the government has claimed a monopoly on violence and coercion . But if you remove the government, that won't mean that violence and coercion will disappear. It will just be claimed by some other organization, which will also claim a monopoly. As the video points out, this is not some hypothesis, this is happening *right now* in many regions in the world which have a weak state..

Although hardly anyone still supports Marx' politics, almost every respectable economist accepts his economic analysis of the troubles of capitalism.

We - the users - are in control because we get to decide which version of Bitcoin we use. If a newer version of Bitcoin is released which we - the users - don't like, we can just refuse to install it, and continue to use the older version. Likewise, we could all decide to swich to a version with some patch.
The miners would have to follow us, unless they want to be mining useless blocks.
In order to reactivate old coins, we'd need the private keys, which are impossible to obtain. In order to block coins, we'd just need to know the public keys. Compare it to e-mail. We could decide to treat Satoshi's coins as "spam" if we wanted to (just install a spam-filter), but we couldn't send them ourselves, since we'd need to be able to log-in to his "account".
Note that blocking coins would be a very controversial act though. It will probably only ever be done if Satoshi for some reason endangers the whole network.

AFAIK bitcoin is kind of modelled after gold, which has been used as money for many centuries. Is gold anarcho-capitalist? If so, then why didn't humanity have an anarcho-capitalist society for all of these centuries?
I would argue that it's the other way around. Anarcho-capitalists will like gold and bitcoin, because it fits their cause. But gold nor bitcoin are *themselves* anarcho-capitalists. After all, they both *can* be used in other types of systems as well.

It's not really a different issue, although I admit that my question was perhaps not the right one. 
The point I was trying to make is that the subjective theory of value doesn't hold up for (scarce) products that we don't *want*, but *need*. We all need to eat, therefore we all value corn the same - more or less. Yet there can be made only so much corn, and it will take a certain amount of labour to produce. On such issues, Marx' theory does hold up.
IMO the free market is absolutely great for products that we do not need, but want. But absolutely awful for (scarce) products that we *do* need. I think that the inevitable centralization of ownership of these resources (through surplus labour) will ultimately lead to oppression, and yes, (neo)feudalism. Hell, this is already happening *right now*. (Hence, the oil-example.)

For me personally? Several reasons, bit this is the most important one: 


The state can do plenty of things without coercion. (And does so.)
I don't know whether or not you are an American, but your question is a very American one, because Americans and American culture considers the state a threat to freedom. This is termed 'negative freedom'; the individual is most free when he is not limited.
Many Europeans, however, believe that the individual is most free when he can fully explore himself. For them to be able to do this, they might actually need help, such as public schooling. This is termed 'positive freedom'.

If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. The free market and perhaps government regulation will make for improvements - over time.

2. A deflationary currency is the best thing that could ever happen to our environment, since the economy wouldn't rely on growth (consume, consume, consume!) to function.

My guess is that this guy expects the price of bitcoins to rise tremendously, and he wants to help ya'll out knowing most of you aren't very tech-savy. I've given out paper wallets a couple of times (not as Christmas gifts) for this reason. And all of the people I gave them to are very happy now, since they've at least quadrupled in value. (More than that in some cases.)


Is that a fact? Even after all of the hype on television and all that? My personal experience is quite the opposite, people are asking me about bitcoin all the time these days.


How about, it's Christmas, none of this is supposed to be about materialism, but about being with loved ones? Perhaps about Jesus, if you're religious.

Most westerners eat cow, but not dog. There are a lot of westerners.


Personally? I wouldn't want the state to kidnap my children by force, lock them up every day, and tell them whatever pleases them. But I do like to have the *option* to send my children to a public school if I choose to.
I also don't have a problem with the state issuing currency. As long as they don't force me to use it, and let me use another currency if I choose to.
If any of this makes me an anarchist, that's fine by me. I have no problem with anarchists (or anarcho-capitalists). I don't really like to 'label' myself though, and I probably have ideas that conflict with anarchism as well.

*"If we seize to regard bitcoin as exclusively libertarian or anarcho-capitalist, before you know it the  government will be allowed to step in and regulate bitcoin."*
This is a huge fallacy. I assume that this stems from the fact that libertarians and (especially) anarcho-capitalists don't what the government to have any control whatsoever, hence they might think that 'statists' want the government to have total control over everything. This is simply not true. **Many 'statists' want the government to have some control over some aspects of society, but not over other aspects.** Although many of them might believe that the government should provide in schooling, they will believe that the government has no business controlling the internet, for instance. Likewise, many **'statists' who like bitcoin will believe that the government has no business controlling bitcoin**. In fact, I would argue that almost none of them do.
I for one would reject and fight against any attempt by any government to control bitcoin, and I would quit bitcoin *today* and switch to litecoin or whatever if they somehow did managed to do so. Not because I hate the state, but because I believe that bitcoin should remain *neutral*.
(And on a side-note: which government is supposed to step in? The American government? You guys *do* realize that the world is much bigger than the US right? Bitcoin is not American, and it seems like Sathoshi wasn't either. Since different powerful countries [can't even agree on the central banking structure]( I find it hard to believe that any of them would be able to regulate bitcoin.)

You have called me a statist in the past, and since I'm not convinced by the whole "taxation = theft" meme, nor of Molyneux' envisioned stateless utopia, I guess you could indeed say that I am a statist... whatever.
The reason I value bitcoin the way I do, and the reason I have actively supported it both on- and offline, is because of it's - that right - [neutrality](
This whole Coin Validation scheme is obviously a direct and preposterous threat to this ideal of bitcoin-neutrality.

This is my default answer to 99% of the critique on bitcoin:
It's not about bitcoin, it's about choice. We, you and I, should be able to decide how we trade with each other. Could be dollars, could be banana's, could be bitcoin, could be bitcoin 2. Whatever we decide on.
If you don't like [insert critique] that's fine. Maybe you can create a currency that doesn't have that, and see if people like it. Actually, it might even be incorporated into the actual bitcoin protocol if people do - it's open source after all.
Personally I think that bitcoin - in its current state - is pretty great, and it would be my currency of choice at any time. [From here on I might or might not continue to argue why I don't think that the given critique doesn't hold up - depends on the perceived willingness of the other guy to possibly, maybe change his view, or if he's just in it to win an argument.]

I think that the fact that bitcoin can be used by anybody *does* imply that bitcoin is neutral. It doesn't prove it, but it does imply it.
Therefore, if libertarians and/or anarcho-capitalists claim that bitcoin is libertarian and/or anarcho-capitalist, I think that tjhe burden of proof is on them. So far I'm not convinced, mainly because:
Also: not all politicians out there are corrupt, and definitely not by definition, so governments might absolutely enforce bitcoin if they choose to.
