These responses are way more sensible than I expected.

Mac does this a lot actually. I'm thinking he's just attracted to both. 
Either that or he's in an insane amount of denial and is trying to convince himself he likes girls.

My personal plan is to hold until 50% of my btc can pay off all my debt, then sell half and keep holding half indefinitely.

I think their point is that the choice of units to compare is subjective. For example, you can't say that the USD is a hundred times stronger than the yen just because it takes 100 yen to equal 1 USD.

I feel like people here are going to tell you to sell your BCC. Personally I held on to mine because I get to hedge my bet for free. As much confidence as I have in BTC, you never know what the future has in store.

Does that mean everyone who ever makes a bitcoin transaction has to report that transaction to the irs?

But by telling me that telling people to not think about something will result in them thinking about the very thing I told them not the think about you are implying that telling people not to think about something is pointless, and should not be done.

I'm a holder and I knew about capital gains but it didn't occur to me that it would work like that. It makes sense though because you're realizing a gain even if it's very small.

I've been holding since mid 2013 and this is my exact plan. If it reaches 10k I can sell half my holdings to pay off all my debt.

I'm skeptical of any argument that starts with an arbitrary percentage.
If I polled every person in the United States and asked each of them to give me one dollar, and only 0.1% responded, I'd have $300k. 
It's like any plan where some smooth talker convinces a bunch of people to invest in something with some argument along the lines of "If the price only increase X%..." Ok... But why do you think that would happen?

It would be a chore but not too difficult. I'd just make a spreadsheet showing the date of each purchase, amount purchased, and the BTC price on that day.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:17:58
You asked someone to explain it and then told them to shut the fuck up when they did. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:40:05
Is there a purchase history on your exchange account? That's the first place I'd look. Otherwise yeah you can look up historical bitcoin prices.

We just need a better word for "young adults" that doesn't take so long to say. People don't have time for two syllable phrases when "kids" communicates the point.

I agree. The way I'd say it is that intrinsic value means it has utility beyond being used as a medium of exchange. Paper cash doesn't have value apart from it's use as a medium of exchange. Gold absolutely does.

I feel like this would only reinforce the notion that Bitcoin is a single entity. AOL Mail had their trademark sound but email in general never did.
