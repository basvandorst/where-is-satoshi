I'm sure you know there are no facts about the future of bitcoin. But it's history shows that it's very possible. The point is people need to invest in this expecting the worst and, inevitably, some are not.

yeah but what's your opinion on gamblers? because it's pretty analogous to that situation. Some people have a certain chemical imbalance where they can't control themselves and destroy their lives.

There is a clear answer but the question is still not well written. What even is PayPal anyway? I've used it a million times but idk why I'm not just using my bank to transfer money. Seems to me like it's a digital currency where 1 PayPal = 1 USD.

Yeah but I used my bank account to get my bitcoins in the first place. So how is it private at all if every transaction can be linked back to the original U.S. dollar to bitcoin exchange?

Yes but a virtual wallet holding usd that only exists online does seem analogous to a virtual wallet holding btc.

Why do you trust bitcoin so much and not other crypto currency formats? Don't you think it's possible another crypto currency could be created any day now that just all of the sudden takes over? For example, maybe the government  makes something that becomes the standard.
