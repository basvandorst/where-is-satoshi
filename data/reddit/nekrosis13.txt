I don't think you actually understand what bitcoin is and what bitcoin is for.
Bitcoin is not an investment vehicle. It is not meant for day trading. It is a currency. A means to buy or sell goods and services. 
If you have $200,000 worth of bitcoin in an exchange, you're literally missing the entire point of bitcoin, and aside from that, if you're going to put that kind of money into anything, you should research the hell out of it first. 
Approximately 10 minutes of research on MTGox would have told anyone that it was a terrible idea to give them any amount of currency in any form. First google search result would show that they had no means of actually paying out cash to their customers. This is an enormous red flag that anyone should have seen if they actually spent a minute looking them up. 
There are plenty of secure places to store bitcoins. If you wanted to be safe, you could put your wallet on a USB stick, encrypt it, then place it in a lockbox inside a safe at a bank. This would be infinitely more secure than any exchange site. Exchange sites are not meant for storing your money. They are meant for exchanging, and then withdrawing your money. That's it.

This reeks of hoax. It's too much like a movie.

Money one can afford to lose...well put it this way. If you invest money, and that money disappears, how upset will you be? If you'd be very upset, you can't afford to lose that money. If losing that money makes you smirk, shake your head, and go on with your business...then you can afford to lose that money.
The whole point is that MTGox's bankruptcy was not by any means "unpredictable". I was able to see it coming long before I even understood the basics of bitcoin. Surely anyone investing any meaningful amount of money should have done their research before throwing their money around. That's my point.
When you lose money on the stock market, that's human error. Nobody is going to give that money back to you. That's an example of losing money being "part of the game".
Cryptocurrencies do not function in the same way that "real" money does. It's a totally different set of rules. One of those rules is "don't leave your currency on exchanges or online wallets", precisely because if you lose that money, you can't get it back, and you're trusting total strangers with that money. You don't know what their backend coding looks like. Effectively, you have absolutely no idea who runs the exchange or if they even have the means to pay you should you decide to cash out, or even worse, if they're able to defend against hacking attempts. It's up to you, the consumer/investor/trader, to figure out whether the exchange you plan on dealing with can be trusted. A 30-second search on Google in October 2013 would have taught you that MTGox was not a trustworthy exchange, and therefore anyone who lost their money either made an error by not researching the exchange, or by willfully ignoring the myriad warnings that were posted all over the internet. Either way, it's their own fault. I'm not saying it doesn't suck, I'm saying they could have avoided it but didn't.
What happened with Gox really sucks, and I hope the people responsible pay dearly for fucking that many people, but hopefully people will learn from this - those who were screwed and those who weren't as well. 
It's not equivalent to leaving money in a bank. A cryptocurrency exchange is not a bank. It isn't a stock exhange, either. It's a cryptocurrency exchange, and it doesn't work the same way a stock exchange works.

That's nice. How exactly do they plan on knowing if you have any bitcoins in your possession, where you got them, and how much you paid for them? 
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:27:40
I never said I use one that won't fail, but generally, you shouldnt be leaving money on an exchange for any amount of time. Deposit, do your trading, withdraw.
I mainly use cavirtex. Selling bitcoin there is more advantageous as the prices are usually higher than elsewhere, and their cash withdraws typically take less than 24 hours to be processed and I have the money in my hand in less than 48 hours from initiating the withdraw.
If ever it started taking an abnormal amount of time, I'd immediately convert everything to bitcoin and withdraw to my wallet. People were reporting delays of several weeks or even months on Gox from early 2013. That's a big red flag.

MTGox isn't a bank. It's an exchange. 
You don't store your money on NASDAQ, and if you did, you would be a complete idiot. 
Rule  of investing: Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose. 
Edit: Silly typo.

A libertarian would argue that these mistakes should be allowed to happen, in order for the people to learn from their own mistakes. 
It's not a question of trust, it's a question of prudence. A very valuable lesson that is taught to anyone thinking about entering business or the financial sector: Always assume that everyone is trying to fuck you out of your money.
If you're not cut out for the game, you're just not cut out for it. There are reasons why everybody isn't working in finance. We all know that's where the money is, but it's also where all the risk is too.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:00:36
Even then, you'd be using an exchange as a bank. An exchange is not a bank, and it is not meant for storing money.
If you're investing $200,000 in bitcoin, and you don't know that there is no "backup plan" or bail outs when exchanges go under, AND you misuse exchanges as if they were banks, AND you do zero research on the exchange you're using, in my opinion you deserve to lose your money, because you're not just making one error in judgement here, you're making several very stupid mistakes.

No, I'm saying that anyone who got burned by MTGox should have seen it coming from a mile away. If I, a barely functional moron with almost no experience or knowledge of cryptos, could figure out that giving money to Gox was a really, really bad idea 6 months ago, then anyone who actually knew anything about cryptocurrency/bitcoin should have known better as well, and they took a stupid risk and lost out in the end.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:40:17
I advocate not having your bitcoins on an exchange, that's a hell of a lot less safe than anything else I've mentioned. Which was my original point. 
Have a good day.
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:10:09
Every noob is immediately told 2 things about bitcoin/cryptos in general:
1) Don't leave money on an exchange, or any online anything, ever, because you WILL lose it
2) Bitcoin is a currency, not an investment vehicle
MTGox didn't go tits up overnight. It was obvious for many months that they had solvency problems. 
Again, if you're throwing large sums of money around without researching what exactly it is that you're doing, you deserve to lose your money.

I don't store a lot of bitcoin in any one place, but I do have several wallets backed up to several devices. For example, my phone, google drive, dropbbox etc. 
Each wallet is password-protected, and in an encrypted folder. If you wanted to get really crazy, you could even hide it in a .jpeg. 
It's a lot more secure to have bitcoin on your physical hard drive than it is to have it on someone else's. 
I'm curious about these "very obvious attacks" that one could use to get bitcoins from my hard drive. Care to elaborate?

User error. Common sense tells us not to leave tons of money in the hands of people who might/can/will eventually have the potential to be hacked or go bankrupt.
I got into cryptos in October and within a few hours of reading up, I knew that mtgox was insolvent and would not be able to pay out the people it owes money to. If I...a complete noob with average IQ...was able to guess this, I'm pretty sure that most people who are balls-deep in Bitcoin should have known it as well.

Hell if you're going to be spending tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on bitcoin, you could easily afford $200-300 to buy a brand new laptop, format it, and set up your network to only allow the bitcoin wallet itself to connect to the internet, then ONLY use that laptop to perform transactions within the bitcoin wallet. 
So you'd turn on the laptop, open wallet, enter password, send bitcoin to "working" wallet - the one you use for transactions - then do your trading, create a new address on the laptop wallet, send your coins there, turn off the laptop.

You can get insurance on a deposit box. Many banks offer it themselves, or you can have your assets insured by a 3rd party. 
If you have a large enough sum on a laptop/USB stick/whatever, you'd be stupid not to get insurance as well. Whether or not individual companies will insure bitcoins, I'm not sure, though.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:25:42
Actually all you'd really need to do is take that laptop and store it in a lockbox at a bank. People do it with solid gold all the time and don't get robbed, and even if they do, the bank refunds you what you lost in the event that THEY get robbed.
Either way, if you're doing it right, there should be at least 4 different passwords that would have to be cracked before anyone can make use of the laptop or open your bitcoin wallet. Then there's two-factor authentication, which would be either on your cellphone or a burner that was never used for anything other than this, which could be stored in a separate lock box in another bank. 
Not  only that, but before even trying all of this, the person would have to know who you are, which bank you keep your laptop at, and the fact that you have this amount of bitcoin, which box is under your name (or your pseudonym if one is used)...none of which they can know based on anything you post online. Bitcoin is anonymous. Even moreso if you use a different address for every transaction.
I thought you weren't being serious as it's a pretty weak point you're trying to make, honestly. I just went full-paranoia on this to prove a point: If you're stupid and make stupid mistakes, you're more likely to get robbed than if you're smart about things.

As I said earlier, I don't keep much in bitcoin at any time. I convert to cash and use that. Not only does it prevent loss of value whenever the next big news article hits, it actually is safer and more practical. 
It's pretty simple to avoid getting keyloggers and other malicious crap on your PC: Run anti-spyware (spybot for example) and antivirus software. Don't click on banner ads or suspicious emails. Basic, every day normal practices for someone with a working brain.
Also: Cold storage. Offline wallet that is kept on a USB stick that is only connected to a computer when making transactions. I create a new wallet address for each transaction as well. If you want to get extreme, you could transfer your funds back and forth between several wallet addresses, back up the wallet to a USB stick, then use another USB stick with a bootable OS on it to boot a PC, do your transactions, send your funds to a brand new wallet that is saved on a separate USB stick, then disconnect from network and change the password for that wallet. Next time you need to access those funds, send them to another brand new wallet with a brand new password, before repeating the process again. As long as you have a new password that is created after the network connection is cut, keyloggers are completely useless against you.
There are many many ways to prevent getting hacked.

Lucky you. I had to make an appointment 2 weeks in advance to withdraw $6000. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:35:01
It's a bank. Literally the place where they store money. You'd think they'd have money, no? 
Not to mention this was in the center of a financial district. Trust me, if 20 people came in and withdrew $6000 every day, they would be just fine. 
2 weeks is a hell of a delay to access my own money.

Thanks. Actually it's about $300. 
I'm kinda iffy on selling bitcoins in person. A quick electronic transaction with a reliable, well known service would be highly preferable.
I was thinking of pulling my BTC from MTGox but then my problem is finding another service that lets you withdraw to fiat easily. Coinbase doesn't work with Canadian bank accounts...
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:40:29
Thanks. Yeah I've converted a bunch of litecoins into BTC, sadly I do need some of that $$ quickly, but the other half of my BTC are sitting there getting fat as we speak!

Wow, that actually sounds pretty awesome. I guess I'll sign up with them when I get home from work.
How are the processing times? Is it the same as a regular cheque/wire transfer (5-6 business days), or does it take longer?
