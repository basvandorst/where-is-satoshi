I couldn't find any information about that. If you guys know something more... From what i see they are generally splitted in different small transactions

Basically with that amount of BTC you can do whatever you want. Also soon is christmas holidays and we know what happen every year after Christmas...

Thank you, i really appreciate your update. Also i didn't know about this limit of 1 withdrawal per week when is &lt;$1000. Howewer i guess main problem is fiat withdrawal and not crypto withdrawal

But i assure you is 100% accurate. Years and years of TA in this post...

Actually i wanted to hear someone else's opinion on this matter)

Looks like they follow a pattern. Always 2 transactions of the same amount, then another 2 transactions of different amount. Probably is a Bot developed by the same owner. This mean all those bitcoins come from the same owner or entity. Anyway that wasn't hard we have the same name

To me they looks like more than they should be, that's why i'm asking
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:07:23
Maybe. But after readying many Reddit post looks like no one was able to get his funds back without struggling for months. I guess months of stress can't be rewarded with a 4% arbitrage, they wouldn't try to withdraw again
