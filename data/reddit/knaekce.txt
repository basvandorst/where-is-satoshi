Yeah, this is what I don't understand.

Yeah, for a normal app this is probably enough, in fact this is the way most of the apps in the company I worked before had been tested.

The clients communicate with other clients over the network. They can just exchange messages with each other (about transactions, blocks, etc.), but have no way of knowing what actual code the other clients are running.
It's simply not possible to create a client that cannot be tampered with. Even if you make a super secure hardware device, nothing stopping other people from writing a software that pretends to be a trusted node but behaves slightly different. And the honest, trusted nodes would have no way of knowing who is honest and who isn't.
@_date: 2019-02-25 22:58:00
A proper full nodes would need to constantly receive and relay transactions, preventing the device from entering the less power consuming sleep modes.

I'm looking forward to try out the purism phone, but that doesn't solve the problem of a full node draining the battery.
A full Linux phone isn't even necessary, you can do it on Android too with the right permissions. But it will drain the battery (I think it will be like streaming music from Spotify for example) and I doubt that it is practical to run a full node on a smartphone for this reason.
I think it'd way more practical to run one on a dedicated server with a stable internet connection and let the phone connect to it when it needs to.

It's also not that easy to fully verify that to software on hardware wallets is not tampered with.
The hardware wallets themselves have all kinds of protections against tampering, but building a clone that behaves as the original wallet, but with a modified software is possible: [ 
You can spot this too with some effort, if you disassemble the device, copy the software to your pc and check if the software is valid using checksums and digital signatures.
But all hope is lost in a network where you don't have access to the hardware of the other clients.You might ask the other participants "are you legit? what's the checksum of your software? whats the signature?" but fraudulent clients could simply lie and claim to be original.

Maybe offloading the breaking change to all users, of whom many have no direct economic incentive to implement it, wasn't the smartest thing to do
@_date: 2019-02-27 01:12:06
But not every app has a persistent connection to the internet at all times.
On modern Android versions and on all iOS versions, if the app goes in background, after a short time all connections get killed in order to conserve battery life. (Android calls this mechanism "doze", you can find more information if you Google it)
If you need real time updates even if the app is in the background, you need a server that sends push messages to the devices via proprietary services like firebase messaging. 
Or you can request a permission to prevent these battery optimizations, but the user has to opt in for that and it will drain the battery.

Train or roads doesn't really matter (also depends on the region, Europe has much more train traffic than the US for example), my point is that the transport capacity of the infrastructure skyrocketed and that a modern life with all the trading and traveling would not be possible with the capacity of the infrastructure of the past. Braess's paradox doesn't say "The less capacity of the network, the better".
\&gt; Considering that segwit allows savings and its adoption has been slow
I don't think fees alone will solve that problem. Even when fees were around 50$ people still used legacy transactions, because there was no easy way to switch to SegWit. That's a matter of wallet software not being smart enough. Non-technical people will just not use bitcoin rather than going through a complicated process of switching to a new wallet that has support for segwit.
\&gt; and that 3rds parties are still spamming the network 
I don't consider that spam. I think that's a valid use case for transactions.

Veriblock allows to secure alternative blockchains by using the security of the bitcoin blockchain. It uses "proof of proof" ([whitepaper]( However, it's quite inefficient and causes a lot of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.
Some argue that such transactions are spam and should be prohibited, for example by changing the bitcoin mechanism that allows veriblock to function (OP\_RETURN) in a way that makes is harder to be "abused".
Other's argue, that as long a they pay the fees, it's a valid use case, or even that bitcoin should introduce new mechanism to allow veriblock-like functionality with less "spam" transaction (more efficiently)

Bigger roads lead to more people and goods being able to get around, though.
There will still be traffic jams, but not building highways and use  bidding to sell access to the limited roads would be ridiculous.
That's not a good analogy.

True, but I mean if they were able to change the file, they might have been able to change the checksum in the website.

So, what is the optimal block size? Why 1MB? Why not 100kB, or 2MB, or 10MB?
If the fees are &gt;100$, LN will not work very well for small payments, too. If closing a channel is expensive and the "dust" limit is higher than the value of most transactions, it's not really trustless.

But how would the cash value of this 42M Bitcoin be determined?
@_date: 2019-08-09 09:56:50
Apparently it's also bullshit in bull markets.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:20:41
I'm with you in principle. I just think that raising the max. block size that can occur in realistic conditions (\~2 mb now) just a bit would make sense.
Yeah, raising the block size is risky and needs to be done carefully. But also, not raising it has caused a hard fork. If SegWit 2X had been implemented, I think Bitcoin Cash would be basically dead at this point and the block size would still be reasonable small in order for even individuals to run nodes with no problems whatsoever. 
And I think, even with all the improvements like channel factories for LN, schnorr, bech32... we still need to raise the block size in order to make bitcoin usable for the masses.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:08:38
Or if a single bitcoin transaction costs more than the hard drive to store the entire block chain? We've been there in 2017.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:44:19
A 4MB block is impractical, though. That's just the theoretical maximum that requires very specific types of transactions.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:52:31
I don't mean the flawed implementation, I mean the principle of SegWit 2X as was the result of New York Agreement. Obviously it would have been possible to implement with sound code.

Or move to a country where there are no taxes on crypto (at least if you hold for at least one year). Austria or Germany for example.
Except of course if you're from the US, then tough titties.

The chain with the most work is chosen, not just the longest chain. For exactly this reason.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:56:38
I don't know where it is in the code, but the scoring is the just the sum of the difficulty of each block.
@_date: 2018-11-18 16:50:28
The timeframe is chosen so that the numbers are similar. The bear market 2014 lasted 2 years. That being said, the pattern indeed looks simar. But that does not mean that it will repeat itself another time.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:54:06
I don't know if that was initially a flaw or if he just was not precise in the whitepaper. But i think such things are the most amazing thing about bitcoin. You think about how you can trick the system, and then realized that they thought about that and find out how they circumvent your strategy.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:45:07
I don't know, do they use it a lot? I did not buy a game on steam using bitcoin since the fees went up to more than a few cents, because I don't see why I should pay extra fees, while the merchant pays the fees on all other payment channels. But of course, everyone is free the use their prefered method.

All this optimization is important, but it cannot do wonders. If we can reach 10-15 tps with 100% Segwit adoption, Schnorr signatures, batching etc. that would be great.
But this is still not enough for mass adoption, even with Lightning. If the on-chain fees are too high, the nodes are given too much power, because switching nodes would be too expensive and they will abuse that.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:45:15
1MB blocks were a temporary solution to prevent spam. 1MB is not the ideal block size forever. Lightning will not work well if opening new channels becomes too expensive. 
Obviously increasing the block size is not going to solve all problems, offchain scaling is needed as well
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:08:36
They wouldn't save much with bitcoin and the current fees though. I think the median few is now about 1 dollar, so it would only be a win for orders &gt;100$ and a disaster for small orders.
@_date: 2018-02-24 11:27:41
The second highest income taxes in OECD states, yes But if you are already rich, you don't pay much taxes. There are no taxes on inheritance, and the tax for regular capital gains are also not that high relatively speaking. And no taxes on selling bitcoin if you hodl for a year.
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:18:14
Then why should a customer use bitcoin if its the only method in which he has to pay extra fees?
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:51:42
It depends on the fork. If the fork changes the rules, so that the sent transaction becomes invalid (e.q. because another transaction format is used), then the transaction will only be confirmed on the old chain. 
If the transaction is also valid on the new chsjn, it will be on both chains independently.
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:21:59
Also, if you deposit bitcoin, you may not be able to withdraw or spend ANY of the money in your account. Happened to me, it was only possible to send the money to another neteller account, then send it back. I felt like I was laundering money. I recommend staying away from neteller's bitcoin service.

But they could hit you with a 5$ wrench.

Because you sound like an absolute douche.
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:05:49
Yeah, but with sidechannels, which also are not quite there yet.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:47:28
So, you think smart contracts like in Ethereum have no value at all (like claims)? Vitalik wanted to add them to bitcoin, but got rejected, so he did his own thing.
Should he not have done anything in your opinion, since he wasn't allowed to add his features to bitcoin (which would have required a hard fork anyway?)
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:25:52
Me neither. But I think it is pretentious to claim that everthing besides bitcoin has no value. I think it is healthy to have competing coins that experiment and see what works.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:53:10
Coins that improve privacy. Coins that experiment with POS instead of POW (I don't claim that POS is superior, but I think it is useful to see how well POS works in practice.
Coins that experiment with smart contracts.
Most of these features would require a hard fork, so it is unlikely to be implemented in bitcoin any time soon, especially given the focus of the bitcoin project.
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:36:47
There are coins that do something that bitcoin does not (e.q. Monero-&gt; Privacy)
There are coins that have a different prioritization of strenghts than bitcoin does (e.q. more centralized, but bigger block size, so more transactions without 2nd layer solutions). 
Why do think, all this other coins are not only inferior to bitcooin, but have no value at all?

I just stumbled upon this by looking at charts in the Android app "Bitcoin Ticker Widget". I noticed now, that there is a bug, which displays incorrect data for new exchanges (If the exchange is younger than a year and the one year overview is selected, then only the available data is displayed, but on the first glance, it looks like the chart covers the full year).
I now checked an BTC-E and it shows the following information:
Conversion | Change
Bitcoin:Euro, 1 year | -39,52 %
Bitcoin:USD, 1 year|  -50,65%
This matches the change in the conversion rate.

Yeah, they are testing for every  IP adress if it is a tor node and block it if necessary.
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:24:14
Looks nice, but what are your fees? I was not able to find detailed info about them.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:49:14
You don't need to hide gains if you live in a country with 0 tax in crypto gains. Austria is beautiful, and so is Germany.
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:08:50
Yeah, especially the "Selfie" seems a bit ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:18:53
And now imagine Tor being on by default. 
Tor is good, but only few people use it and it's very easy to screw it up and accidentally leaking your ip address.

I can't speak for all countries in the world, but I think that in nearly all countries it would be considered fraud.
It's the same as tricking people into entering their credit card number for "security purposes". Yes, people should know better, but that does not make fraud okay.

He "bought them all". He probably bought bitconnect too.
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:18:00
So you think it's better to have most people use custodial third party services than to increase the block size?
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:55:08
But there are block sizes for which we know that they would'nt centralize the block chain in any significant way.
And there is precedent anyway for setting the block size: The time when the block size was set to 1MB as a temporary spam prevention.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:27:22
Looks like it was just pumped for the memes
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:48:23
Do you think that any block size increase would compromise the chain? 
I.e. the current block size of ~1.9 MB if segwit has 100% adoption is the biggest possible block size that would not compromise the chain?
I mean I could run a node on my smartwatch, even with 8 MB blocks.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:20:01
Yes. If you sell after one year +of hodling, you don't need to pay  capital gain taxes.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:06:13
I'm pretty sure that it is still fraud.
Another example: Talking to random people on the street, telling them you need to inspect their wallet for drugs, and then stealing it if they give it to you.
There is no identity tied to cash, but this is of course still illegal.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:55:32
Oh, so I didn't know that . Unless one once to renounce it's US citizenship, my argument is wrong. Sorry.

Also, ethereum was 5 months old and basically a pre-alpha experiment at the time.
