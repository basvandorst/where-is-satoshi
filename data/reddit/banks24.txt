Just wait it out. The Bitcoin will appear in your wallet eventually. It's just super slow right now.

Very easy to use and it feels great knowing my crypto is safe. I'd definitely recommend.

Take a look at cryptocurrencybros.com. I found it useful to learn about the wallets. 
I personally have a ledger and love it. Paper wallet is a good idea too.
First I'd so some research online and on YouTube. It won't take you too long to decide if you want to invest in these technologies or not. Then you can decide on a wallet, preferred exchange, etc.
Good luck!

So what if I bought 1 bitcoin on coinbase, shapeshift to Monero, then shapeshift to a newly created bitcoin address?

I'd recommend keeping yoiur coins in a wallet offline. Check out ledger nano s. Safest option.

Ledger nano s

I found coldstoragebitcoin.com helpful. There are 3 main options. I use a ledger nano s and love it. That's probably the most popular and safest. You definitely should move your crypto to a hardware wallet. Safest way to keep your funds offline while holding your own private keys.
