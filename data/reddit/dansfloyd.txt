Definitely on our list of places to expand, we should be there very soon! Feel free to tell your favorite restaurants about us in the meantime. :)

Ha, that could actually work... Our system is mainly used for take-out or delivery, but I guess you could order take-out then just inform the restaurant you would like to eat it there.

Stix is delicious! We just launched BTC transactions a couple days ago, and now were spreading the word!

Menufy rep here. Just wanted to let you know this was a very rare case. This location began the setup process with us, but never completed it. Normally these sites would never be turned on to accept any orders. In this case, the restaurant's site was turned on by accident. Sorry for the mixup. We have fixed the issue, and we hope your next experience using Menufy's services will be much better.

Hey Cruzanusa, I'm from Menufy. We didn't list our sites on OSM. That was done by someone not affiliated with us. Sorry for the confusion you experienced... We are looking into ways to allow our restaurants to accept bitcoin payments directly in-store. Until then, the only option would be to put in a carry-out or delivery order on the restaurant's website, then choose the option to pay with bitcoins online.
We will try and get in contact with the user(s) that posted on OSM, and hopefully get it sorted out. So other people won't run into the same issue you had.

Not at the moment, but we will look into adding them.

Both NY and NJ are definitely on our list of places to expand. We will be there very soon! Feel free to tell your favorite restaurants about us in the meantime. :)

We are looking into expanding to other countries, but for now, yes, USA only...
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:25:22
We will definitely look into them, thanks for the links!

Hey bitbotbitbot, Sorry to hear about your experience... We have had success with our bitcoin transactions, but we have also had some hiccups along the way. If you could email bugs and tell us the browser you used, the OS you're running, and what actions you took, we will look into the issue asap. We are issuing a refund on your order, and you should have your Bitcoins back very soon. 
Sorry for the inconvenience. We hope next time you will have a much better experience.
