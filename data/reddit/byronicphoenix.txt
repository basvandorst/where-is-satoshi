Blind? No. Principled? Yes.
He could well be pardoned. If Gary Johnson or Rand Paul or someone similar wins in the near future, he absolutely would be pardoned.

Ulbricht is a hero. He made the world freer, and took a lot of violence out of the drug trade.
The War on Drugs has caused far more problems than drugs ever did. Drug addiction is an illness, not a crime.

A person has the right to choose their own self-destruction. Instead of lashing out at innocent people (yes, innocent) over consensual activity, they should consider that the answer to preventing substance abuse and suicide is not violence but rather better mental health treatment and building a world that is less shitty and that drives fewer people into such means of escape.

What the fuck are you talking about?

Ulbricht was never convicted of hiring a hitman. He has never even be tried for it, and won't ever be.
Even if DPR did do that, he would have been completely justified. It's self-defense to take out someone who wants to snitch on you for a victimless "crime" that could send you to a cage, especially if it's for life.

Might be a victim of theft, but certainly not "having drugs sold to him" or "hurting himself" because the concept of "victim" is Non-Applicable in those cases.

He and the roommate may have been lovers, or otherwise had some sort of agreement.
Can't just assume that in the absence of a written will, though.

No, it shouldn't be a crime. No victim, no crime. It's consensual.
Using violence to interfere with consensual activities is and should be a crime.

No. It is inevitable that such a person will be elected 
And if and when the War on Drugs ends, as it inevitably will, I have no doubt that the sitting president will pardon Ross Ulbricht. He's an unambiguous hero, as are Snowden and Manning. Justice will come.

I think you may be confused as to who the good guys and bad guys are.
