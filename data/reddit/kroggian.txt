Hey I've been wondering. If you could go back in time, how much Bitcoin would you get? Like you should probably not buy so much that it would really mess with the markets. I'd settle for 20,000 BTC. :3

That post of Pompliano is no more vicious than if you blamed old white men for suicide bombings in the middle east.

Correction: The people who really run this planet are old Jewish men. It's kind of racist to try to frame a race for the crimes of another race.

You're god damned right.

I'm white, and it's not that I am offended when people say bad things about whites. I am offended when people accuse whites for the activities of Jewish gentlemen and refer to them as "old white men." Then I am offended, because lying for your own gain while damaging others is very offensive to me.
Also, you yourself may be a little less white than you are claiming, poopiemess. Maybe you have a little bit of those... old white men in you huh?
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:32:24
The only way to save his post would have been if he wrote (((old white men))) in paranthesis.

I gotta ask, aren't pretty much anyone you know in the top 1% of the world? I mean don't you have to pretty much be living off of the Liberian Dollar to be like most people in the world?
@_date: 2019-06-18 00:02:12
Ah well! Best not worry. Blow off top, 60% correction. A little patience and the bullmarket will go into full swing soon enough. And it will reach 200 - 400k. Then I wonder where the next bear market will take us. The guy I trust most on such analysis speculates that the next low would be 40 - 80k. I guess I can live with that.
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:29:01
Yay! Been waiting for this one.

Hmm, you're right. I guess it's just space travels that Nazis did...

No! You know who is really in control? THE NAZIS! ... the Ashkenazis. xD

10.000? You fucking kidding me?
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:06:52
Yeah, about that. Bitcoin will hit 50.000 this year.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:03:31
10K is certainly the moon to those reading about Bitcoin for the first time in like 8 years and go and get their old wallet to see if those 400 Bitcoins are still in it. Can you imagine those poor schmucks?
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:10:11
In the beginning, it's easy to get angry about getting banned just for stating truthful facts that can not even be disputed. Then once you've seen the same thing happen thousands of times, it's just the nature of evil. What do you expect? That evil happens by accident? That it's ignorance that is breaking Europe? When you realize that it's by design and you know exactly what happens when you try to speak out against it, it's both easy to rile yourself up and be mad at the evil ones, but it's also easy to remain calm and go "Yeah, it's just these evil ones doing their bit on purpose. Of course we get banned."
Can you send your chart my way? I document all sorts of interesting information I can find. It's good to keep vast libraries of red pills!

True, 10,000 will have a psychological effect and possibly will help blast through that to the 13k level. That's where the next level of resistance is located. Bitcoin might wanna take a healthy small breather for now. The question is when are we going to get a blow off top and see a 30 - 60% correction?
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:07:35
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:06:32
Well, the process of it's going to moon is going to be of greatest personal interest to any holder. Some people virtue signal and try to tell that they're not even excited about the price, but what Bitcoin means in terms of revolutionary technology. Come on, they're excited about the price! Admit it. There's no shame in it. But you can be excited and also be greatly enthusiastic about how Bitcoin has the chance to KILL THE BANK.

Hi, could you please donate some Bitcoin to me? I could always use some! Please give me a little BTC. I'd really consider you a cool person if you donated to me. Please!

People who don't like Nazis are genocidal maniacs attempting the ethnic cleansing of all of Europe.

Oh shit. Bitcoin just broke through a very thick level of resistance, which makes it support now, hard to break below. And there's very little volume to volume trading above 9000-9200. You realize that this means that for Bitcoin to go to a new all time high from here is very easy? It's harder for it to break through the previous resistance levels, but now all the major ones appear to have been broken. We're about to see some fireworks. Prep the spaceship. We're going to the moon.

I also like what JFK said about our Uncle.
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:41:26
6100 to fill the gap and then go back up again and soon there after in some rapid moves reach 20K due to mining difficulty?
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:04:26
Caved in Wojak level!
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:40:11
Also a gap needs to be filled. So correction is likely in the short-short term. But at the same time mining difficulty is at an all time high so Bitcoin is magnetically going to get pulled towards 20k soon.
@_date: 2019-06-08 11:00:10
The thing about "Moon", you know it's just simply the matter of "what's your Moon?" Plenty of peoples moons have been reached beyond limits they never thought possible. Some people woke up to a reality where after a few years they hear Bitcoin is worth 5000 and then dug up their old wallet still containing 1500 BTC. God speed to those poor mortals who wake up one morning and realize they are multimillionaires, eh?
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:38:56
Yes, he is a good man.

The average white person isn't a Nelson Mandela...
Yeah, today's Rockefellers are Jewish, not white.
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:30:56
And he's very racist in the sense that he is blaming white men for that which is done by men who are not white. It's not old white men doing this. It's... someone else, and you get banned for naming who they are. If it were "old white men" and the old white men were like people describe, then you'd be constantly banned online for speaking out against old white men. The fact that corporatism, the supposed battleship of these men, encourages you to rip on white men, that tells me that they are not white men.

Funny how it's just that their skin tone has gone the way of the chameleon to match Europeans. If you put their genetics under a microscope, the microscope says LEVENTINES FROM THE MIDDLE EAST!

Loans could be state subsidized and be something to be used to make peoples lives better and easier rather than currently putting people into indented servitude. Work enslavement is what we have now. Purposeful inflation for the purpose of keeping the workers down. It works like this. You can save your money for however many years you want, but because inflation it keeps being worth less and less over time. You're not supposed to rise above your class if you're a peasant. And let me tell you how a loan in a country that cares about its people would be set up. Usury is illegal under penalty of death. You loan money from the state bank. Private banks are outlawed. You will owe back the exact amount you borrowed. But for the health of the nation and the well being of the people, for every child you have, 25% of the amount you owe back on the loan gets removed.
Your consenting adults thing is a farce. You could bring it to any extremes presuming they were deluded on purpose with propaganda all the way from the cradle, such as is being done in our evil malevolent society.
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:40:58
You like legalized and mandatory usury that destroys nations?
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:30:36
I remember when Bitcoin was like 5000, before sinking to 3200. My friends who didn't own Bitcoin and knew nothing about much of anything said they think Bitcoin is pretty much done and over with. I'm like: Heh yeah naw.
Obviously some people never heard about bull markets and bear markets.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:39:03
Yeah, who is afraid of the itty bitty correction?? I mean it'll not push back through 6400 support level. It could go as low as that but that's where the bulls will go berzerk if bearish nonsense tries any tricks.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:13:26
Dude, keep buying. Do not sell. Sell in like april 2020. That's could be close to the end of this bull market we are just entering. Then enter in again when the bear market is over!
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:00:32
How about we make lending money with interest illegal then? So that you don't have to pay more than you borrowed? And treat anyone that ever performed an act of usury to the death penalty? That's my solution. It's final. Heh heh.
