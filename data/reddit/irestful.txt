I agree.  If the bitcoin stays stable, more people will use it to buy/sell goods instead of speculate.
This year, a lot of online stores integrated bitcoins.  Finally we'll use bitcoins for its intended purpose.

Oh yeah you did.  We'll buy all our computer parts from you from now on.  Thanks for accepting bitcoins guys!

I personally don't think this will ever happen.  Not my grandma at least.  She's already 89 years old and got hit by a car twice this year.  I don't think she's in the mood to learn about bitcoins...

Yeah, you are probably right.  Most of my family members panic at the idea that she goes outside now.  What they don't realize is that she probably don't give a fuck whether she lives or dies.
I assume she just want to have some fun until it's over.
**EDIT** She also got interned for mental illness 15 years ago, during 5 years.  She got out because apparently she was no longer mentally ill.  5 years ago, she told me that she still sees poison coming out of radiators from time to time.  She won't tell anyone because she doesn't want to get interned again, and that if she keeps an onion with her at all time, she can't be killed by the poison anyway.  For that reason, she always have an onion in her hand bag.

Couple years ago, she got a cataract surgery.  Couple days later, she was supposed to go back in surgery to have lenses installed in her eyes.  However, she never went.  For this reason, she was almost blind.
This year, in January, she decided she wanted to walk around outside.  However, she was almost blind and she's almost deaf as well.  She crossed the road while an electric car was passing by and she got hit.  She broke her hip and got surgery for it.  After 4-5 weeks, she was able to walk again.
In May, she decided to go outside again and got hit by a taxi in her own parking lot.  Keep in mind that she's 4 feet 10 inches tall... apparently the taxi driver just didn't see her.  She broke her tibia and apparently she won't be able to walk as good as before.
Couple years ago, she also lost her driving license while driving her car in reverse in a very trafficked area, just after her cataract surgery.  But that's another story!

If you receive a fake note and go to the bank, they won't give you a real note.  They will just keep your fake note.
Otherwise, fraudsters would simply go to their favorite bank and tell them they just got paid with fake bills, to get real bills out of the fake money they create.
