For the record, there is no such thing as "according to TA", beacuse tehcnical analysis isn't one single thing. If it were, we'd all be millionaires.

I can't tell if you are sarcastic ("Wall Street always gets away with anything") or misinformed, but just to set the record straight: no it doesn't matter who did it. If you have information that is not publically known and likely to have a material effect, you are not allowed to trade on it.
I do agree of course that it can be really hard to prove anything, so in practice many people get away with it. But the laws and regulations are quite clear.

No, that's not how this is supposed to work. Cryptocurrencies is all about trusting the system instead of trusting people. Except, of course, when we can't trust the system, in which case we immediately fall back to trusting people.
Some people really seem to believe that you can have it both ways. Some people are always disappointed. The overlap between the groups is almost perfect. Go figure.

ELI5: why does "wait long until touching those funds" help? I can see some reasons why these coins can be tracked, and other reasons why they can't be. Neither of these arguments have anything to do with time. What am I missing?

No. The credit card company you use has the power to transfer money from you to a retailer under agreed-upon circumstances (i.e. when you pay by card). That doesn't mean that the credit card company "effectively owns" your money.
But yes, an exchange that tarded bitcoins could immediately settle every single transaction on the blockchain. Except for the fact that it doesn't really scale. And, more importantly in this case, if you want to trade on the margin you need to pledge collateral. And that collateral can't be controlled by you, i.e. can't be BTC in your wallet.

No, not correct. if you buy a share, the ownership of that share will be transferred from the seller to you at the Central Securities Depository (CSD) in your country. The exchange just matches the orders and then tells the CSD to make the change of ownership. They never own any shares in any sense.
Also, shares that you own can't be shorted against your will. However, you may have invested in a mutual fund, and the manager of that fund may have agreed to short some of its holdings. In that scenario, stuff that you may consider yours can be shorted. But then we are pretty far off from any bitcoin analogies.

Sure. Who said otherwise? I just pointed out that these two unrelated statements were both false, not that they had anything to do with one another.

So Martin Luther was around in 1054 when the church split that first time? Interesting. And about as true as the time traveler post.
