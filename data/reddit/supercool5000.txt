The US saved your grandparents' asses in WW2. They have a right to do whatever they want.

Easy to say if you didn't lose any money to Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:50:12
But...their recent price drop has not affected the other exchanges. This is an indicator that the Price/BTC is stable despite Gox's problems. As long as Gox comes back online anybody willing to buy BTC at a massively deflated price will make a huge profit.

I don't think you understand why regulation exists. But by all means, trust the guys throwing Gox under the bus. They told you that you can, and have absolutely nothing to gain of course.

I completely agree. These competitor exchanges are acting like vultures. It doesn't matter how popular their frontmen are, they can't easily demonstrate trustworthiness any more so that Gox. And the reaction in has been atrocious. Many of our fellows have been screwed over pretty badly, and the general response has been rejoice. Let's alienate the losers with our superiority. 
The biggest threat to Bitcoin isn't Gox or regulation. It's Bitcoin's most vocal supporters.

I hope not. They still have my money.

Yes, but the value of my dollars sitting at Gox is $5600. I'd like that before they shut down forever please.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:21:55
Doesn't matter who's face and name are attached to an exchange. Gox is what you get with unregulated commodity trading, and it has a face and name. It's not the first exchange to go down, and it certainly won't be the last.

You're a couple days late. But I think the answer to your question can be found a few weeks ago in a post regarding the community being hostile and unfriendly compared to the community. That post was proven correct in the past two days with all the sore winners coming out of their closets to brag. The truth is that this community has the loudest assholes I've seen in a long time. And to be honest I hope every single person who gloated loses their shirts like I did.

Good luck throwing all your money away in Buttcoins.

It's not paranoid crap, it's reality. Try reading some of Schneier's recent editorials.

No they haven't. I just got my SC single  today. They just took a year to fabricate the damn chips. Irritating, but not a scam.

Bullshit. You need a key length greater than 1024, probably greater than 2048 before you can use PGP/GPG securely these days.

You're such a wonderful citizen. Reap the benefits of taxpayers without paying taxes. How moral of you.

Where are you getting your misinformation from?

BoA was great to me when they bought my mortgage with Countrywide, after CW leaked my PII data. They did nothing.
BoA was great for the first 4 years of my mortgage before I refinanced. They refused to pay the remainder of my 203K rider. They only had me prove to them that the work was complete 13 times before they released the funds. And since they didn't put my name on the check I had to spend another 6 months proving that I didn't owe contractors any money.
BoA can burn.

The guy's just a witless troll.

Right, and there's no way for the NSA to compromise your system and setup a keystroke logger to capture your passphrase. Or compel you with a court order and solitary confinement to give it up. You're perfectly safe.

Doesn't make him any less of a piece of shit. I hope he's murdered in prison.
