Yes, it's unavoidable now; only a matter of time. \(Reason why:  [
The question is how much time... And the absolute minimum is when it's technically possible to handle that many TXs, which won't be until LN gets fully up and running and installed on most people's phones. So a couple years at soonest, and at latest is a matter of politics, since it depends on many factors like how fast Trump prints the dollar and if there is another war, etc.
Even if everything stays boring and on this current course, I'd still expect it to happen within 15 years. Maybe by the 20th bitcoin birthday.

You obviously haven't been using Lightning much. My fear is that Bitcoin will be named a Privacy coin like Monero sooner rather than later since the industry that popped up to track BTC transactions will now have to admit that they can't trace lightning payments.

This one is short, but overall better.

I couldn't agree more. ;)

Gold had a good run, 5,000 years or so...  Not bad!
But it's clearly Bitcoin's time to shine. If you're not convinced why yet, allow me to direct you to the 2nd half of my latest release:

Bitcoin -is- most well-known for drugs. You have the politicians and biased media to thank for those lies.

Thanks! I did actually post it a couple of days ago, but it was really slow that day I guess. -And Mods would remove it if I try again.

Happy holidays Bitcoiners! The Youtube Crypto content purge is underway and I have no idea if this video will survive the gauntlet. If it goes missing, try it at Bitchute or Flote:
High quality audio on Souncloud too:

Thank you! Quite a compliment.

It doesn't seem to make any price predictions or give investment advice... It's basically a history lesson. 
I've seen no reason to believe the purge will affect this one.

Money is simply the most liquid asset. Gold was the most liquid asset off and on for 5,000 years. It was always an asset, but while it was the most liquid one around, then it was called money. 
Bitcoin isn't really money yet, but it's built to be the best money ever once the more liquid ones (dollars, euros, etc) finally fail.

Even though 12 words is still more combinations than there are grains of sand on this planet, 24 is already the most widely used seed length.
