Thank you, and an upvote

Thank you, I set it up that way so both sides of the blades received air flow.

Blowing the heat out a vent would completely defeat my purpose. but since wind is just air friction it does eventually become heat, so 99.999999%-100% is converted to heat.

And with 3 units working, my 2 rooms are at 82 F (27.78 C), the rest of the house is 59 F (15 C), I am going to open one of the doors a bit to let some of the hot air to the rest of the house, and maybe move one of the units to another room since I just finished modding the 4th antminer. -also not all is converted to heat, some is converted to wind by the fans (about 2.5-3A worth)

I don't bother with BitCoin, Currently set to mine DigiByte Coin, gets 36 coins a day, they are currently worth about 4 cents each, so I make about $1.44 a day, but it cost me 650W x 24 = 15600/1000 =15.6 Killowatts  = $4.06 a day to run, but that is instead of buying and using a heater.  Here's hoping they go up to .25 per coin by 2019!

Just an update, currently I have modified 5 of the units to version 4, to provide 3250 Watts of heat or 11050 BTU, outside temperature is currently 55 F (12.78 C), but expected do go down to 28 F (-2.22 C) tonight.  2 units heat my workroom and bedroom (connected by door), temperature is 71 F (21.67 C) and 3 units warm the rest of the house one in each room is 66 F (18.89 C).  My main heater (not in use) has a 4000 watt element.  Since I have started this I have mined 205 DigiByte coins @ 4 cents each is worth aprox $8.02.  If anyone wants to buy the DELL PSU and power breakout board, I currently have 11 units not in use and I am selling them for $90 a pair, including shipping to the USA 48 States (Alaska and Hawaii will have a $9 shipping charge, sorry)

Which would make this better than a heater.
