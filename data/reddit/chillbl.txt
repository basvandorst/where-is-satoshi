as much as I hope that the world should be fair. It just isn't.
there has been a test where they gave a group of people the same amount of money. but there is always a group of people making bad choices financially and people who make smart choices financially. (and otherwise in life). People should learn how to live correctly and wisely. Of course you can be put in a situation that is out of your control. but on the other hand you can also prevent getting in such a situation in the first place.

Well you speak of a fiasco, but what is this fiasco exactly?

this guy is a genius when it comes to the crypto space.

Just say you have been to the future. their brains are just too outdated to comprehend any if any of the substance you  have delved in.

@_date: 2017-11-20 19:13:17
got downvoted for asking that. some people aren't happy....

I don't understand the link between the blocksize versus the "getting around the ban"? Maybe it's a bit of a noob question. but how can smaller or bigger blocksizes actually influence any of the ban or not. I thought Blocksize was the amount of transactions the bitcoin system can handle? So more People bigger blocksize needed (in simple terms, I guess). Did I miss something?

Although I'm short in the crypto sphere, and found a way to get in without sending pictures. If you we're to tell me that I had to send a bunch of random people personal identification. I wouldn't persue it any further. Luckily there are alternatives. Sending personal stuff towards random companies is a viable answer to say: NO. IMO
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:01:04
Yes I'm curious as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 09:00:34
Pff, expensive cunt. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:34:02
I agree, but the greed is strong. and the eco system allows it now. it will be a different picture when crypto's become the norm. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:28:55
But doesn't this also count for light wallets connected to the web?
Or the Wallet ledger which gets it's key from the chrome extension(or atleast it's managed by the chrome extension)?
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:36:38
Can you point to a source of this statement?
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:10:19
Help me understand, what in the end got you hacked? the place where you got your private key from? (bitadress.org?) 
the using of blockchain.info? he got some info from you somewhere, otherwise you could not be hacked.

Nope, it's a term used by yuri basmanov, a communist defector. who tells the exact line of themes about 30 years ago. which are unfolding now. the people that strives the hardest for the equality they think they are missing, are the first ones to be killed when cultural marxism takes over. which you can deduce if you think really long and hard about it. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:13:10


wouldn't that end up doubling your amount of money. (real noob question yeah). I assume it won't but what happens to the market cap if a coin just splits in 2?
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:31:21
Thanks!
