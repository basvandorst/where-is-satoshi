Oh my god you haven't thought this through at all.

Quit trolling.
Seriously though, what the fuck. You haven't thought this through at all. How can you replace ISPs? Somebody has to pay to run the cables to create a network. Are you going to run pipe under the oceans?
What he's not telling you is that **this will create fractional mini-internets which CANNOT communicate with each other**
That's entirely useless. Fractional internets are a **bad thing** which are to be avoided at all costs.
The entire power of the internet is that anybody can talk to anybody. I can download files from Saudi Arabia if I want to.
Fractional internets would be the end of the internet as we know it.

Trivial? Are you going to run cables across the ocean and maintain them?
Hardly fucking trivial.

But regardless you couldn't get a signal from one side of the planet to the other, so it'd be splinternets, not the internet.
If you can't download porn from other countries, why bother?

You mean ISPs?

SOMEBODY HAS TO RUN THE CABLES.
You going to do the whole internet as wifi? Are you fucking joking?

I've said from the beginning. Bitcoins are very important, but you'd be a moron to invest in them. Use them to buy and sell and trade, and then move on back to more reliable currencies.
Although at this point, the dollar is about the same. Keeping your money in dollars is a pretty dumb investment.
