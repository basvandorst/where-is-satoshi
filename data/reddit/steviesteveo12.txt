That may actually get you under begging/pan handling rules.

"Mathy" is maybe a good thing in a cryptographically secured currency.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:32:09
At standard Western Union and MoneyGram rates?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:19:55
To be fair, this is just taking more words to say "it's just a matter of time before it hits $10k/bitcoin"
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:59:55
It's "difficult" rather than "diminishing returns", strictly speaking.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:03:49
I get that no one is born knowing how to code everything, but that doesn't mean you need to learn by writing an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:15:27
That's an amazing thought -- of course it'd be in textbooks. We know what the first cheque was used for all these years later.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:11:22
Damn chartist 
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:26:57
Yeah, the old engineer saying: under-promise and over-deliver.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:52:03
Depends on how long term they're talking, really. No one's saying $10k by next week, but in terms of "once bitcoin rules the world..." talk it's relatively common.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:38:05
The big problem is that nothing, no method, is particularly effective at accurately predicting the future, especially in the long term. One method may be marginally better than another depending how/what/when you do and measure it, but that's not to say that either is going to be a crystal ball.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:59:10
Yeah, it's the classic counting your chickens thing.
If you cash out and make less money than you put in, you lost money. Before that it's still all to play for.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:26:08
Yeah, it used to be every office needed to have a fax machine because they were really important and heavily used. 
They've since been mostly replaced but they were big in their day.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:06:16
They're not stupid. You wouldn't be the first person to open an account, put a little money in it and claim to the IRS that's every penny you have. They'll do regular audit things.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:05:22
No, the problem is the clogging up itself, consider the alternative: users would not be happier if the exchange was clogged up by many big transactions instead of small ones. Users are unhappy about the exchange being clogged by many transactions, they don't care what size all those transactions are.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:01:31
Yup, to be clear this (accurate money calculations) is because Bitcoin-Qt was expressly programmed to do it. Regular, binary approximated floating point math does not work with money.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:02:17
It's entirely up to us. If people act like it's going to be hype and crash, then it'll be hype and crash. It's not crashing because of some natural phenomenon -- it happens because people buy/sell en masse.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:58:25
It also needs better ways of exchange.
It's very, very easy to exchange Bitcoin into USD and vice versa. Doing it in other countries is more difficult (and expensive). It's not a third world problem either -- even the UK doesn't have the same set up.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:31:57
Yet. Give it time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:48:54








You're not actually making *any* argument here.
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:20:23
I don't think you're disagreeing with me as much as you seem to think you are.
You're paying someone to solve a CAPTCHA and waiting ten seconds or so for someone to solve it, rinse and repeat?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:58:32
It's not their first rodeo. You don't outsmart the IRS just by telling them you have less money than you actually do.
What usually gets people caught is spending the money from their secret accounts/piles of cash. Currently they don't know what's in your secret wallets, but keeping it in your wallet forever doesn't do much good for you either.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:28:23
If nothing else, you want people to come, buy coins and drive the prices up. Scaring people out of the market by calling them cretins doesn't help anyone.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:38:40
Oh yeah, much less work if nothing else.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:17:27
Not impossible, there's a fair amount of malware out there pretending to be bitcoin stuff.
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:46:44






Can you define "diminishing returns" for me?
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:26:50
They potentially can. You'd just use the same tricks you use when dealing with people operating in cash along with the advantage that the blockchain is a perfect record of every transaction ever made.
It wouldn't be easy, but it's not their first rodeo.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:22:40
Guy in the audience at a conference wants to get a few pageviews out of a question he asked.
It's just very high school -- "oh, *you* don't know about it? *Everyone's* talking about it"
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:37:57
Absolutely, it's technical analysis *of the chart*. It's pure chartism.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:08:59
["Think of it as a fee that is practically free to anyone actually initiating their orders manually."](
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:07:57
Oh, I grasp it fine: it's hard, difficult, not easy, laborious, impractical, tricky, complicated etc etc.
You're using the Econ 101 term wrongly, is what I'm saying.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:01:24
And then there's pure trust -- you might not like MtGox but at least the community can agree on it better than some node on a p2p network.

Dirty Europeans, hoarding their currency in their pensions and savings accounts.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:47:58
I don't get this myself -- surely those smaller and smaller amounts are worth proportionately less of the Bitcoin they are dividing? You get 10x more Bitcoins if you let them be divided into tenths, but each one is worth one tenth of a Bitcoin... and so on for an infinite (practically) number of decimal places.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:02:08
I mean, if we're talking about capabilities instead of what it actually does why are we selling it so short? Let's just say numbers.
It has the *capability* to be worth a billion dollars each.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:13:50
Or converted into goods and services. The IRS is pretty good at telling if your car doesn't match your income.
If you just sit on the coins forever you'll be totally fine, but that's hardly the point of making a fortune investing in Bitcoins, is it?
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:39:50
Everyone tries their best to sell short (but not too short) of the peak. The best ones are just the people who actually manage it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:20:12
Yeah, wouldn't mind being talked through how that works myself.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:01:08
Yeah, it's a great solution.
If you want to pay someone to solve thousands of CAPTCHAs (and *wait* for someone to solve those thousands of CAPTCHAs) that's fine -- you can certainly place thousands of orders.
On the other hand, if you want to place *one* order -- you just type the letters.
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:43:14
Bring a sharp Rechtsanwalt(?), then
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:38:24
You're suggesting to "disincentivise small transactions". I'm pointing out the problem is not the size of the transactions. It is the *number* of transactions. I don't know how to state this more clearly.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:06:01
Yeah, you get the odd one saying "oh shit, I've lost everything".
I mean, where do people think the money is coming from? Cashing out involves selling your Bitcoins to other people.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:44:35
It's also likely that a good proportion of his coins came from people who are now happy to have cashed out before the price dropped. I'd say he might even want to be mad.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:44:28
Yeah, it's far too much for a kid to decide to sell lemonade for an afternoon.
What it really means that the only people setting up stalls at all are really serious and doing it as a job, in which case the licenses are far, far too low and disadvantages businesses with actual fixed premises.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:14:01
Me too. There's better stuff to do with your money than buying Bitcoins at twice the market price.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:29:59
Well, there's obviously going to be someone holding the bag at the end but many people seeing something as a magic box you put your dollars into is a good way to *make* a magic box you put your dollars into.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:07:40
It's just the metric system.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:05:38


...how small do you think the UK is?
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:43:15
Are you asking me or telling me?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:45:24
They're not laughing at Ghandi anymore for reasons other than his "witty" ads.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:23:53
Even if the next word is "definitely"? ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:16:41
To be fair, in terms of self-fulfilling prophecies, it's almost certainly what'll happen (loads of people thinking they should buy now it's low).
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:11:13
And at that sort of gouging, do you even want to?
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:19:16
It doesn't matter what size they are -- they're being cancelled.
