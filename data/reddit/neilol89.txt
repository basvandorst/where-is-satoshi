Great explanation and the first one on here that is correct. However, I don't see spot markets following a negative futures price simply because it will not take that much money to prop up spot after opening massive longs. That is the lower risk trade here, or am I missing something? The short contract holders will see that spot is not following their trade, and they will be forced to hedge...by buying the underlying...
The next few months could get interesting. If you and I can figure this out...we arent alone

To start - I'm assuming you're in a fund trading with committed LPs capital.
In general, are you seeing different types of investors entering the space? I mean non-hedge funds or HNW individuals. Any bigger private tech or non-tech institutions? Any smaller endowments or pensions?

I feel bad for the people they scammed and are now just realizing it.

Probably should sell if you really think this is true

For now it seems. Some constraint is finally welcome - I thought Voorhees was starting to go off the deep end. He's the only one I wouldn't have expected to push a rushed solution like S2X
