If you backed up or have the seed for that wallet, you can recover it and the value to a new wallet. This is the power of blockchain, and also why I suggest you seek out a meetup with experienced people who can guide you. (Lost coins are fine though - in the long run, that means mine will be more rare. And rare things can be quite valuable.)
The second thing they’ll do for you (if they’re good people, that is) is educate you why keeping coins on an exchange is not a good idea. You need a ledger or trezor or other hardware wallet.

Rather than debating FUD threads in a subreddit, why don’t we just simply downvote them? The top post, I mean. If the redditor posting FUD is truly trolling, they should eventually go away if they get downvotes enough and lose enough karma with every account they start and have to throw away.

Hello fellow Canadian - have you heard about Coinsquare and Shakepay?  
Anyway, the answer is Fees. They charge a fee for having bitcoin on hand to sell to you. Also, the price depends on the exchange rate between CAD-USD. If they don’t have a proper banking arrangement in place there, they’re paying spot rate and pass that along to you. 
Do you have a bitcoin wallet yet?  I would encourage you to try to find a local Meetup where you can ask users near you some of the questions you have in person. They may even help you set up a wallet on your phone and recommend a way to secure any coin you have and future purchases.

Price stabilization is something that looks to be happening since December’s turn, what some people call “support” if you zoom out to a 365 day view, for instance. That bounce off the apparent bottom is a good thing for people to establish their footing or foundation. It’s about 20x higher than where I got in 4ish yrs ago, sub C$400, but the awareness of bitcoin is much more widespread. So I’m long-term bullish, which means I’m also an optimist, but hopefully not overly so. Regardless, from a 3000 day viewpoint, the trend remains upward, in a much more rational, traditional and stable growth rate. What needs to happen is a global market correction like 2008, then we might get some real traction and forward motion, but then we’ll be dealing with HODLers and no-coiners. In that case, the HODLers need to be the VCs and banks. And THAT will make things quite interesting.

You had my upvote until the “regulations” part. 
Liquidity comes from wider adoption; more people need to hodl and USE bitcoin like they do their credit and bank cards. Unfortunately, for the use part to happen, lightning network has to become the de facto standard, and that means getting businesses to accept it. 
Get everyone you know to buy as much bitcoin as they are comfortable with hodling, and tell them to wait and ask businesses if they accept it for payment.  The more of those requests they hear, the more they’ll look into it. Lightning people need to drown out the confirmation delay argument.

@_date: 2017-02-07 17:26:08
Have you decided how much to hodl and how much to use?  The more people who have some or parts of a Bitcoin, the more valuable it truly becomes. It's not that a coin is worth $1k USD, it's that $1kUSD only buys 1BTC. 
Sorry, but if Bitcoin is truly going to become the global disruptor it's designed to be, when people convert fiat to crypto, it's important IMHO to have the plan to help build the infrastructure, the economy. And that means you have to spread it around, use it. 
And then eventually, because we'll be dealing with seriously minute fractions of a coin, money will lose meaning and banks will finally get busted up and governments can get back down to what they were designed to do.

It's happening around the world to a lesser extent than Greece. That's fine. But global critical mass is approaching: with 20-some percent un- and under-employment, if not more (by "traditional" metrics), how can we not be looking at HOW we look at things?
Change is good, and we've been transitioning into the next global Revolution (Industrial &gt; Technological, I should think; possibly Informational) for a couple of decades now. This taxation thing is the death throes of "money."
It's actually really neat to be seeing the circle complete.  What alarms me is the speed at which that happens: there is no such thing as infinite acceleration. And that brings us to the subject of terminal velocity...

The uptrend has been nowhere near as meteoric. This has been a sustainable, steady, months-long climb which to me indicates wider spread understanding and adoption...approaching critical mass, rather than pump and dump. What we need to be careful of is if the old school traditional economy tries to regulate or outlaw the technology. I hope it plateaus soon, this most recent climb, to quiet all the "holy shit!" and "Yahoo" And turn it into "Ok, so how do we move forward from here?"

Value - like many things, there's market value and then there's the selling price. Often they're not the same. Something is only worth what someone is willing/able to pay for it. 
So, if BTC becomes more desirable, it will likely become more scarce and people might be willing to pay more for it. Like we're seeing now. Flip side to this is that whatever you're buying BTC with is in greater supply and decreasing value - sound familiar?  (Low interest rates, QE...)
My gut tells me we're at or near some sort of a tipping or transition point; we're going to be living in VERY interesting times for the next while with all sorts of potential changes afoot.

They’re simply following convention in other countries with the registration/KYC, or that company is ahead of any law that might change to protect themselves. I’d be more concerned with what they plan to do with the collected data if the law should fail to be enacted or gets struck down. 
I can relate to painful fees, also living in a country with its dollar pegged to the USD; sometimes it’s not BTC price changes that affect the price at a machine, it could be exchange rate changes as well.

I have been buying since $250, and I’ll keep buying this dip because I not only hodl, I use BTC too, where and when and however I can. (You should too). That said, I DO have a wallet stashed for retirement/rainy seasons, and I keep adding to it, as well. (Stuff like impending trade wars and economic corrections/bursting bubbles don’t scare me like they used to)

I've been using the hashtag  on my twitter for a while. It's good to see people are starting to take both parts of that advice. Money sitting there gathering dust doesn't build an economy. Money moving, changing hands, transferring value does. 
That said, I'm sure there are hodlers out there who would be interested in financing with their coin to see a return and to build the infrastructure to shore up this movement that seems to be starting in earnest finally. Micro finance to emerging/developing nations would be a great way to spread the coin. Somebody needs to get on that.

I had the prepaid Visa Debit card as well, but my pairing was set for BTCUSD rather than your ETHEUR. Was this by chance near the end, when EU bankers shut down the issuer (or was it their ability to issue cards to non-EU residents?) due to KYC/AML concerns?  It took me a while to get a refund too, and yes, crypto in general corrected downward, so yes, we probably took a hit, but that’s what the incumbents whom we’re trying to supplant or bypass want. I can’t blame Shakepay for that. They’re a MUCH different company now.

From Shakepay’s POV, a startup can’t make your situation “right” because they run on pretty tight margins, and they likely took a loss on the card fiasco as well. You might always be butt-hurt, but they have gotten past it and moved on in a significant way.

Good points, but the question gets down to dollar cost averaging...or in this case, bitcoin cost averaging. It’s a good strategy for offsetting capital gains, if you’re inclined or compelled to report those, in which case you should also be able to take a capital loss. 
Interesting times, right? Change is coming...
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:06:16
I’m gonna get slammed for this, but you only get taxed on income, and if there is no way to associate you with the appreciation of an asset, there’s little way to prove a capital gain. So - don’t take more money out than you’re already making to avoid popping up on the radar of the authorities. Further - what are you converting to fiat for? Use the bitcoin to buy things, and pay the lower sales tax with bitcoin - make it the seller’s problem. Governments for the most part do not officially recognize bitcoin as anything - yet. Also, if there’s no receipt, how can they tax it/you? There’s little way to prove it was income for you...
The laws are going to change things significantly, but we have institutional inertia on our side. Also, in a large organization like a government, the left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:06:05
Well, first thing I would advise is to live carefully and simply and well with your money. To do that, set aside a specific weekly, biweekly or monthly amounts to buy BTC with. (I call this being a bitcoin Klingon: “today is a good day to buy”) If it goes to 40k or 100k, you won’t have to think twice about taking some profits to get your eyes done or whatever. It sounds like you have the self discipline to do this, which is great, but don’t forget to enjoy life and treat yourself for all the hard work you do to earn the $$$ in the first place.
@_date: 2019-02-16 15:57:00
You understand their hands were tied when authorities shut the cards down, right?  EU banking authorities caused your loss: Your issue is with them, not Shakepay. Did you try to claim those funds as a capital loss on your taxes? Fair is fair: if those authorities want their cut when we make money, they should also share our pain when we lose, wouldn’t you agree?

Have you heard the phrase “In God We Trust; all others pay cash?”
Perhaps the appearance of having an account like at a regulated bank, and a Visa branded piece of plastic with your name embossed on it to allow you to spend the money in that so-called account, was what fooled you into thinking your money was yours, and safe. 
There seems to be no way to mend your broken heart over the loss of the funds, in as speculative an agreement as a potential romance. You’re better for having loved and lost.

@_date: 2019-12-19 08:52:02
Don’t fool yourself: just because there aren’t any laws yet doesn’t mean they’re not watching and planning how to write the laws. What has to happen for good laws to be enacted is more people need to have bitcoin.  Politicians listen to majorities, not fractionalized minorities. Until everyone you know, work and live with has bitcoin, and all of them can say the same, bitcoin and crypto is in danger anywhere you are. Yes, turning off the internet and the electricity behind it would cause them more problems than it would solve, but laws are a very different matter. Pay attention and act accordingly. Democracy is still fairly new there, so you should still be in good shape and remember how to speak to people about making these changes to your society; things aren’t so easy here in the rest of the West/g20, where we are much more complacent after many years.

Whichever, it’s really tough to tell what’s actually going on in the market, especially since the fake volume news hit...yes, I’m talking to you TA types. I stand by my assertions that 1) it takes money changing hands frequently and often for it to have value, period, and 2) an economy works best when everybody has a little money to make  happen.

I will hodl until I can find a way to start building a new economy alluded to above through investing. And if we’re successful in building enough of a community and ecosystem globally, then I won’t need to hodl any more, because everyone will have some and it’ll change hands frequently and often, well beyond the reach of the current gatekeepers.

Exactly on point re:electricity/network. People who really understand are involved in community meshnets and renewable power to run them.

The money leaving Facebook bc of Cambridge Analytics has to go somewhere, as will the money that leaves Google when their time comes. Be patient: The dominoes are starting to fall. But don’t be greedy; an economy works best when everyone has a little money and it changes hands frequently and often. If you own &gt; 0.5 BTC, start spreading it around and buy more while it’s still on sale.

Because it has become much more mainstream, and it’s value has increased tremendously whereas fiat has been replaced with credit; in these increasingly uncertain times, a ubiquitous and irrefutable system of transferring value beyond the current infrastructure’s power to control and tax that would be a highly credible threat to those powers’ longevity.

If ever there was a statement for disintermediation, this is it. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:57:21
Exactly this. 
I’ve said it before, and I’m about to say it again: Bitcoin may well be the currency of the global economy the current powers that be have been encouraging us to adopt and/or blaming their shortcomings on. An economy works best when everyone has a little money and it moves frequently. Right now, after catching a LOT of attention over the past few months, these last two things are happening - more people are buying in and we’re working on making that change hands fast and cheap, like cash does now. 
When the majority of people on the planet have a couple of wallet addresses each, we’re going to hit a tipping point....say 12 billion active wallets, 4 billion people with 3 addresses each. Then banks and governments can have their helmet fires. Right now, let them scramble to patch the holes in their sinking ships.

(Please call them no-coiners rather than normies. Normal is in the eye of the beholder, and I want people with coin to be normal and the norm)
Correct in my opinion.
Further, the value in relation to fiat fluctuates too much, whereas interest rates etc are rather stable. 
What we should be focusing on what will give BTC the most immediate value, which in my opinion is more people with some, so they can start to look for ways to use it...as quickly and easily and ubiquitously as they currently do with credit and debit. This will be critical if/when the global economy “corrects” and that will present Bitcoin with its largest opportunity that I truly hope it will rise to.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:31:36
I wasn’t suggesting govts adopt bitcoin. I was suggesting the people wise up, revolt and replace govt with a bare bones smaller version, or the ultimate: none at all, where people vote with their money. 
But your scenario will probably be what happens: govts issuing their own crypto. Rather than a global currency, they’ll preserve the need for forex, they’ll backdoor Wallets to truly bankrupt people who don’t follow their laws which they’ll make increasingly arcane and bewildering to normal people...solidify control.

Bitcoin isn’t currently working as it was designed to because people still think of it in terms of fiat currency, and too few people have any, and people don’t understand the subdivision down to 7 decimal places. So, when a Satoshi and a dollar/pound/euro are on par and tens or hundreds of millions of us hold some satoshis -rather than tens or hundreds of thousands-THATS when this will change. And technology to exchange them as easily as fiat is getting better daily. 
As for taxation and capital control- taxes will change, and capital control has been in place from the start.

And in bitcoin’s case, the government is the people who use it, and that government is also the bankers. Replaced are the egos and personalities of the bureaucrats and politicians by the code and the miners running it. Yes, the coders can code away, but unless and until consensus among the majority of users is arrived at, that code can’t change.

Agreed!  I keep telling people in my circle/area “an economy works best when everyone has a little money and it changes hands frequently and often” but they seem to be focused on moon/lambo or their version of it. What has to change is the perception of Bitcoin as a stock or real estate: it’s really the currency of the global economy current stakeholders/gatekeepers have been using as an excuse for years to drain our wealth to their pockets with their fiat. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:55:07

You owe it to yourself to find a bitcoin/crypto Meetup in a nearby city, where you might likely run into people similar to yourself who are aware of what works best in your jurisdiction. 
This is a good place for a broad overview, but until you give us a better idea of where you are, you're potentially exposing yourself to legal liabilities that may ultimately end your business (worst case), or give it some rather uncomfortable growing pains.

Having watched -by complete chance- V for Vendetta last night, Andreas’ speech here is a call to arms. Little or nothing happens unless and until a critical mass of people declare “me too” and/or “l agree” and move forward together...but they have to be shown the light, have the penny drop and accept that change needs to be made. 
It’s not about tax evasion or avoidance, it’s about being mindful of how/what you’re paying, and consciously controlling it. The theory is to slow the recklessness of “the machine” to the point that it no longer runs roughshod over you and anyone else who doesn’t have the resources to get on board. Levelling the pitch, so to speak, while minding the pennies so the pounds take care of themselves. That’s the conservative economic perspective; the liberal is that an economy functions best when everyone has a little money, and that money changes hands frequently. Right now, it’s this latter part that’s the issue: in both the incumbent/fiat as well as crypto economies, far too few parties hold far too much money and do far too little with it.

Governments are, however. That stems from cutting into their income stream: taxes!  It's their own fault though, for not recognizing crypto as currency. As long as it stays this way, they'll be less and less powerful, so get more of your friends, family and communities on board.

Tax laws that are currently in place have likely been adapted from those on the books since the beginning, like that economy. Crypto is a new economy that will mean new laws entirely - for now, enjoy the "Wild West" but be prepared for audits if they get their stuff together before you die.
