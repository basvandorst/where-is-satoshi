Does Ledger Nano S support fall into "Phase 3"?
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:41:30
I moved mine last night... slightly nerve-racking.  As others have suggested, a test amount is a good way to go.
In my case, the fees were still quite high with Ledger's default settings even on the low and slow confirmation method.  I added custom fees and set to 40 sat/byte.  It went through on the next block, so I guess that was still plenty.
I'm not sure what the best or lowest amount for custom fees should be.  If anyone knows a good way to calculate that I'd love to hear it.

Excellent infographic.
And props for sneaking Andreas' address in there!
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:42:59
Andreas Antonopoulos. Definitely Google and watch any videos that come up. He has long been a supporter and educator of Bitcoin. He has been inspirational for many of us and the reason we got into this whole crypto scene.

That's definitely a gamble.  $13M payday or nothing.
For $990,000, you could buy ~63 BTC at $15,500.  If the price rose to $50k, you'd have a profit of about $2.2M.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:22:22
You mean 2018
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:06:45
By far the best answer here.

I'm no expert in statistics, so sure, 50-50  :)

CME or CBOE.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:36:20
It's a market where you can bet on the future price of bitcoin without owning bitcoin.
In traditional markets, if you're a farmer planting corn you'd sell futures contract so that if the price of corn falls he'd still be guaranteed a certain price for his crop.  In the other direction, if you're a manufacturer who buys corn to make a product then you'd buy a futures contract to guarantee a price in case the price of corn rises.
The one worry about the bitcoin futures are there are no natural buyers of futures contracts.  Miners would, in theory, be natural sellers.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:46:18
Their warning is that there are a still a lot of unknowns with Bitcoin and we should move cautiously if and when it gets integrated as a feasible mass payment system.
That's pretty much a given.  I'd be worried if they weren't giving this guidance.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:34:46
Because this one doesn't hold or ever touch Bitcoin.  This ETF tracks the Bitcoin futures contracts, which also never touch Bitcoin.  It's all cash settled.
Each share in the Winklevoss ETF was intended to represent some amount held in The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:40:10
Wow, that's well done.  So much lingo in there that if you get it all you're probably already a Bitcoin Billionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:08:49
The nay-sayer at the end really doesn't understand the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:07:07
It's not about better, it's about meeting regulations.  Because Bitcoin can't be regulated or controlled a pure Bitcoin holding/investment ETF has been denied.  But one based on Bitcoin futures, which are also regulated, seems like a done deal.
While this is a step in the right direction, the real test will be an ETF that actually has to buy Bitcoin to track the price.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:42:14
Keep in mind that those walls are often taken down as the price approaches.

Can you give some insight into why you recently doubled your trading fees? 
I like the unlimited trading option, that's different from what others are doing and I applaud it.  But it seems the main problem VoS has is lack of volume.  Increasing the trading fees ensures that VoS remains only an entry and exit point for people getting in and our rather than doing a little day trading.  People flock to Bitstamp and BTC-e because their trading fees are 0.5% or less.  I was a big advocate of VoS because you were a Canadian exchange with fees competitive with the big guys.  Now, although I'll still use you guys over Virtex, I'll do what little trading I do on BTC-e.
Also, perhaps you could do promotions of reduced fees, or even no fees for new users (verified) for the first month or something.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:22:07
Gee... wonder if the price will go down?
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:43:27
Next Tuesday at 3pm (JST)...
People may give out advice on where they think things are going or when they think BTC is "cheap", but nobody knows.  A lot has happened since December!
BTC is cheap compared to the high!
When will it go back?  Who knows.  My guess is later this year (purposefully vague!).
Honestly, if you bought and are pissed that you bought at the wrong time and are stuck then you shouldn't be investing.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:14:59
I don't think so.  It isn't a very high priority.

Ah yes... the power of the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:49:51
If you guys end up being the first to implement this it will do tremendous things to solidify your reputation!  I sincerely hope you can pull it off and others follow.  Bitcoin (and crypto in general) needs this now.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:30:10
Thanks, good to know we're more Bitcoin friendly :)

LastPass. I love it! 
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:09:28
Absolutely good advice.
I'd also recommend to anyone using the Blockchain.info wallet that you have the 2nd password feature enabled (as well as a strong password and 2FA).  This ensures that if your account is compromised, which usually happens from backups sent to email, that another password is required to send any funds.
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:12:14
Two options that I know of:
* Turn 2FA off and back on again.  This gives you a new QR code that you can save this time.  Obviously do this before you lose/wipe your phone!
* On a rooted phone you can back up Google Authenticator data with TitaniumBackup (or similar?).  When you restore this data is (should) have the codes still.
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:55:52
200 x $646 = $129,200
question still remains, why would you pay more than buying it new?
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:38:18
I suppose you're right at that.  Most people would assume that all BTC issued so far are available, but we know for sure that quite large quantities have been lost.  Like the Brit that chucked some old hard drives that had a hefty wallet on it. 
It's always possible for some early adopter to come along, drop a few thousand BTC on the market and down goes the price.
@_date: 2014-07-29 23:28:59
Did the feds have a tough time seizing the bitcoin from Silk Road then?  Cause it didn't seem like it.
@_date: 2014-04-21 21:42:55
Stop trading their Bitcoins at Virtex and start trading at VoS.  Moving their business.  Fees are higher at Virtex.
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:26:46
Is it cryptographically signed?  Otherwise, how do I know it's the REAL Dorian Nakamoto and not Satoshi himself?!
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:59:59
Perhaps it was not enforced on older accounts.  I can confirm that signing up with Bitstamp a few months ago that verification was required to do anything.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:33:24
If nobody controls the keys then they're lost forever.  If that's the case then the number of available BTC dropped pretty significantly.

Looks like we're doing the sell the news part now. Drop straight to $680. We'll see if that's the bottom.

What's more likely to happen (or what a buyer of MtGox would hope for):
* Someone buys it, cleans it up, secures the code, fixes the problems
* Site starts trading again, but there are big restrictions on withdrawls so there isn't a run on the bank
* In the time it takes people to get their money out they do a few trades
* Enough people are invested in trades and keep their money there
* People forget (but you shouldn't!)
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:05:21

@_date: 2014-01-14 17:32:07
Perhaps.  I do hope for larger Bitcoin adoption, but as much as I love it I still look at it objectively on how it will help me.
In this case, you're right, unless I'm being paid in BTC then this probably isn't for me.  But I don't ignore the fact that there will be a rising demand for services like this.
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:34:47
What app and phone are you using?  Is your phone rooted?
If you're on a rooted Android phone then you can back up the app+data with Titanium Backup and restore it on your new phone.  I've done this with Google Authenticator at least.
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:18:15
I've had similar experiences with their support.  The one support call I made, the guy I talked to was completely un-emphatic about the problem and eating a bag of chips while I talked to him!  
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:53:28
Shady. I don't trade there any more. The experience I had there was fine though. I just worry about what would happen if I did have a problem or if they just disappeared.

Then that should be a warning to all.  At least if you're using them, don't keep all your money on the exchange!  That goes for all of the exchanges!

@_date: 2014-08-15 17:56:58
If I had a crystal ball, I'd be rich (and I wouldn't tell you what I knew ;) ).
Price goes up and down.  The only thing you can do wrong is buy high and sell low!  It may look like you bought high right now, but in 5 years, perhaps it won't.  Or perhaps we'll all be saying, "That bitcoin thing was a stupid investment!".
I'm holding a lot more than 1 BTC... no panicking here.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:06:20
Sometimes that crackhead wears a nice suit and has been doing business for a long time.  Lots of people trust him.  My point is it isn't always obvious you're going to get ripped off.
This can be said of every financial institution though.  You're still right that you have to protect yourself from the Karpeles and Madoff's of the world.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:10:52
Despite all the negativity this gained yesterday, this is exactly why I like VoS.  There was an issue, it was dealt with quickly and publicly addressed!
I'd rather see a misstep that is dealt quickly than one that is not.

Don't you have ~$1.4 million on BitStamp ready to go?
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:43:09
Good on Bitstamp for implementing a quick solution.  I think long term they might need something a bit more robust, but at least it tackles the absurdness of having someone eat into a large trade $1 at a time and getting stuck with huge fees.
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:26:07
What is the Canadian regulation environment like?  Has our government made any official stance (other than taxation)?
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:29:59

I have zero knowledge of iPhone.  Sorry :(
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:21:40
I like it.  
One question though, how would the exchange prove that they had ownership and access to the indicated addresses?  In MtGox's situation, they may still have the bitcoins but have lost the private keys to access them.  
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:44:31
You illustrate an important problem with Bitcoin though (not necessarily the protocol).  The security currently required is too difficult for the average user.  Until things get easier and reports of "stupid people" (read as regular users) getting hacked mostly go away, Bitcoin won't be ready for mass adoption.
At this point in time though, you're right.  You've got to be security minded or you're gonna get ripped off.
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:50:01
I came to say this.  Pass the savings on to the customer who would otherwise be paying with credit card.  Then people will want to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:44:38
Seriously? Some sort of tax structure was inevitable, and this one is what everyone expected. 
Taxes are unavoidable... Get used to it. They suck, but you gotta pay your share. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:57:15
Kinda scary! They haven't goxed anyone yet though, right? There were warning signs with Gox where trust should have been lost (and was for many). 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:22
Do you have to talk fast to be a developer of Lightning?

Wow, you exactly summed up why I stopped using KeePass and started using LastPass.  Well done :)
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:43:03
More services in Bitcoin are good and I'm glad this service is there.
However, realistically, if I'm going to pay my bills with this every month it's going to cost me $15-20 (5 bills at $100-200 each).  Or, I can pay them with credit card or direct from my bank for free (credit card would actually give me cash back).  There's no incentive other than wanting to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:51:51
Must be a great deal?
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:26:42
Most aren't. Only KeePass is. 
OpenSSL was open source.  Open source doesn't necessarily translate to security. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:54:32
I don't think their liabilities include the lost BTC.  I have no idea though.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:15:19
So the cost of doing business in Canada is just higher?  That's unfortunate.
I'm glad that the higher fees only apply to fiat, but that is how most people trade.  Unfortunately most of the coins all move up/down vs fiat in correlation.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:38:29
I like it.  Just a little extra security.
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:59:54
Here are the changes relating to TX Mallebility:


This release contains a few fixes for transaction ID (TXID) malleability 
- -nospendzeroconfchange command-line option, to avoid spending
  zero-confirmation change
- IsStandard() transaction rules tightened to prevent relaying and mining of
  mutated transactions
- Additional information in listtransactions/gettransaction output to
  report wallet transactions that conflict with each other because
  they spend the same outputs.
- Bug fixes to the getbalance/listaccounts RPC commands, which would report
  incorrect balances for double-spent (or mutated) transactions.
- New option: -zapwallettxes to rebuild the wallet's transaction information
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:59:46

@_date: 2014-02-25 19:57:16
That's the problem though.  All these exchanges now NEED to be able to prove that they're solvent.  It's the next step in Bitcoin.
MtGox has to be a lesson!

I've done a 360 on Bitcoin myself!
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:20:14

@_date: 2014-11-28 23:36:06
It'd be cool to be able to bankroll the site as an investment, like JustDice did.

Nothing. They said any announcements were fake and they had already issued a statement on Bitcoin and they have made no changes since then. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:00:05
About time!
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:38:06
Doesn't Vault of Satoshi do this?  You can get the address to their cold wallet and cryptographically prove that they're solvent.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:23:31
Must just be Canadians then.  I don't know how you get $637.50 from Overstock.
Edit.... I get $637.50 when I make it pull up the US price.  So yes, just expensive for Canada (and probably other countries)
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:17:33
I like the idea of paying a fixed amount for trading, but I don't work in the volume to make it worth it. The 0.5% fee they had was the best thing they had going in my opinion.
If you were trading a lot in order to get the lower fee rate, wouldn't you just pay the $99 a month and do unlimited trading? That puts a cap on how much they make from whales it would seem.
Increasing the fee from 0.5% to 1.0% for low volume trades now doubles the cost for new entrants testing out a new exchange or getting into crypto currencies. It doesn't benefit me since that's likely the range I'm trading in.
I applaud doing something different and that's what the unlimited trading is, so good for them. However, I see the fee schedule hurting a lot of their users.
All the rest of the announcement is great.  More options on everything is better!
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:18:24
Excellent!  Hopefully not the only exchange to do this!
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:06:31
I was confused too... apparently they thought it was much bigger than it is.  For many, this would not have been a surprise.

People are going to bitch at you and call you a noob, but your insight is valuable.  While experienced traders and long-term crypto HODLrs may already know a lot of this stuff, too many people come into this space thinking it's easy to make a quick buck (or BTC).
I made all these same mistakes years ago thinking FOREX trading was easy and predictable.  It is until it swings the other way and you get margin called... then you're fucked.  Lessons learned.

Does anyone know if there are any differences or reasons to use this instead?

I can't imagine why, but some people are choosing to sell their coins and take their money out in fiat, but with no way to add CAD to accounts the only buyers are ones that haven't moved their fiat out yet.
Why these people don't just move their coins out I don't know.  You can withdraw BTC but you have to confirm a withdrawal address by email first.  Instructions are on the site.

I'm getting seriously pissed off that I can't withdraw any BTC.  They've had it locked down for 2 days with zero ETA on when it'll be open again.  They've said they're closing, give me my money!

I like the idea.  I assume the goal here is that royalties can go directly to the owner.  If so, how will that be enforced?  I mean, what stops anyone from sharing any song and collecting royalties from someone elses work?

I wish I could upvote this comment more! 
I used to dabble in the forex markets.  It's a great feeling to see your investment up about 20 grand and think you've made money.  It's horrible to then be completely wiped out and wonder what happened.
You haven't done ANYTHING until you sell.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:53:34
I had that worry too actually.  I took a look through the code that the site uses and the random seed is generated from the date and time down to the millisecond when you click on generate.  In that sense, it seems pretty secure.  
Here's the code:
    // Mix in the current time (w/milliseconds) into the pool
    // NOTE: this method should be called from body click/keypress event handlers to increase entropy
    sr.seedTime = function () {
                sr.seedInt(new Date().getTime());
        }

I'll likely be setting up an account too.  What they need most is people selling coins though.

I left CaVirtEx for LibertyBit because of the fee.  Time to sell those shares?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:50:00
Yeah, something like 104,000 BTC in the last 24 hours.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:44:01
Are you being paranoid?  I guess it depends on how many BitCoins you have.  If you're transferring 1, yes, 1000 probably not.
You can run bitaddress.org offline on a computer not connected to the internet to be totally sure that the address is unknown to anyone else.  But even if it was, if you use a good password and Bip38 then it's still secure.

The bill payment option is both cheaper and as fast, if not faster than the wire.  It still takes 3-4 days on average though.
Also look at vaultofsatoshi.com.  Canadian, lower fees, but very little volume so far.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:42:12
I think you just illustrated one of the biggest problems with Bitcoin.  It still needs to get easier to use.
That said, it's not like investing money with the current financial sector is easy to understand.  It's just that there are people very willing to take your money and hold your hand through the process.
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:46:18
0.0002 BTC so far apparently
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:25:47
Where are you located?  Your options to buy are going to be quite different.
If you're in the US, then Coinbase and Localbitcoins are probably your best options.
For Canada, VaultofSatoshi.com and Cavirtex.com are your only options (I guess Localbitcoins too, and if you're in Vancouver you can use the ATM).
Europe and Asia have other options.

I can attest to the choice of declaration in Canada.
I tried my hand at Forex trading a few years ago.  I was doing really well... until I wasn't.  I ended up losing about $5000 and gave up that game.  Tax time came and I claimed that I was day trading it (had hundreds of pages of transactions... I was day trading) and claimed it as an income loss.  This had the effect of reducing my overall income rather than having a loss to offset capital gains.  CRA disputed that and said I couldn't do that.  I pointed out the points in the tax law that said I could and provided them with all the printouts of my trades.  It could have gone either way, but they let me get away with it.

Step 3: ???
Step 4: Profit

No, it isn't a box of GPU's.  ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit.  ASICs are purpose-built, permanently programmed chips with the application printed into the chip at the time of manufacture.  This approach produces hashing capacity many times greater than that of FPGA’s and GPU’s at a much lower powerrequirement.

$15 for a wire is pretty good.  I thought it was $30 actually.
VoS is definitely the cheapest for actual trading.  Your only other alternative (in Canada) is Virtex.  Then you're looking at $5 to deposit via bill payment (Vogogo) and 1.5% trade fees.

You are correct.  They are apparently adding CAD in the next couple of weeks.
I funded my account with BTC instead.  If you're looking to buy in and are already on Virtex, then I suggest buying there and moving BTC to VoS.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:51:57
Oh, I understand.  My point is you have to be reasonably technically savvy to use bitcoins.  It's a barrier that probably won't go away, but I think in the future there will be more services to help people along.

The deal with BIP-38 is that it adds a layer of encryption to your paper wallet.  Without it, anyone who has the paper has your private key.  With it, you still need a pass-phrase to decrypt the private key.

The big problem is the lack of coin.  It just needs more users.

The only other Canadian offering at this point is VaultOfSatoshi.  LibertyBit might come back apparently, but not for a couple of months.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:02:44
Probably not, but there is definitely going to be more speculation in the short-term, so it could have a good run.  It already has had a good run if you bought it last week!
Long term there isn't enough room for all the different types of coins.  Litecoin doesn't really offer much over Bitcoin, at least not enough that I can forsee much adoption over Bitcoin.  Furthermore, if there are true deficits to Bitcoin's acceptance, then changes can be made to Bitcoin... so why branch the code?
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:13:47
My thoughts too... but it's a chicken/egg problem.  Everyone's waiting for more volume to switch.
I appreciate that Virtex is doing a lot of good things for Bitcoin in Canada, but the fees suck!
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:10:52
Op didn't say anything about it being a stock or mention USD.
However, the USD price is important because the only way to make money trading currencies is to pair it with another currency.

I've just moved to LibertyBit.  I hope it works out.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:02:32
Likewise.  I started there and got verified, but 3% is crazy!
LibertyBit is the way to go, but also suffers from very small volume.  More people just need to switch.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:32:12
Ha, the one place I didn't include.
Bitstamp and BTC-e are your two best options, as well as Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:30:36
Exactly!  A lot of people know what it's worth, they just don't trust the guy on the street.

@_date: 2013-04-10 23:14:37
I don't particularly like speculation, but trading bitcoins against other currencies is pretty important.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:52:40
If you have the same documents you submitted to Virtex on your computer you can get verified at VoS today!
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:20:45
Get used to it.  This is what makes Bitcoin so powerful beyond a simple currency.  One day there will hopefully be no need for the actual marriage certificate, just the blockchain.

I have never done a cash deposit, so I couldn't say for sure, but if they're anything like ANY other business with a bank I would say anywhere from 2-4 DAYS.  Banks take time to clear the money.
That's why we're doing this whole Bitcoin thing!
