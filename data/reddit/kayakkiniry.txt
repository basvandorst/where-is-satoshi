He’s just randomly using words he’s heard once. I think he’s joking though.

Speaking as somebody who works in finance, essentially no institutional investors are even considering touching bitcoin except for Bill Miller and a few other anomalies. This is evidenced by insanely low open interest in the futures; the CME only has around 200 total open contracts as of this comment, that basically comes out to around $20 million worth of contracts if you don't account for margin, which is a whole other issue with the contract itself (from what I understand investors are required to post 90% margin, an insanely high number.)
I'm not making a comment on bitcoin at all, all I'm saying is that to my mind futures have ended up being essentially negligible and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
Edit: CBOE futures have low open contracts as well 1,730 open JAN18 contracts. Also- how do I post an image w/out using imgur? It's blocked at work- I can throw in a Bloomberg screenshot to show my numbers.

Futures contracts are more leveraged than holding the commodity/currency itself.

Me too! Every news site I go to talks about bitcoin futures, but very few of them mention the low volume

Literally just today the SEC halted trading in a crypto company, although it's thinly traded anyways and they cite concerns about manipulation so the company being related to cryptos may be ancillary.

Does your employer match 401k contributions? You should be taking full advantage of those if so. An instant 100% gain on your investment is still nothing to sneeze at.
