I'm confused why people care about this.  It they push 100 million into bitstamp/kraken/etc vs this new second market.  They can still manipulate it.  It does matter where the trading occurings big money moves and sets markets.  
My suggestions is to get a second job and buy up as much Bitcoin as you can, we the big money starts flowing in you will be rewarded handsomely.

Thanks man, I heard you when you said best price wins.  However, hypothetically what would be your price ceiling when the average weighted prices is $622

The people of Cyprus are going to be getting a great deal on the coins they buy this upcoming morning.

My website is being redesigned to integrate Bitcoin payments at the moment and will be live in 2 weeks.  
I will not be cashing in any coins until I reach 21 total, as this is all the cash I have on hand.  
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:59:54
Make it 21, thats my goal.  1% of 1% of 1% of all coins that will ever be.

I've only learned about Bitcoin two weeks ago, but I've very interested in its future.  
I own an Ecommerce website that will begin accepting Bitcoins in 2 weeks and would like to buy Bitcoin off the exchanges and sell them locally as there aren't currently any sellers in southwest colorado were i live.  
Localbitcoins.com seems to be a way to both turn a small margin while increasing adoption in a area of the states that currently doesn't have a strong presence.  
What am I missing?
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:41:07
I'm with you.  2 week drawn out process that has been scaring a ton of people into selling their Bitcoins and yet people keep buying and prices have stabilized.  
Not the best way this month could have been, but all in all Bitcoin has been resiliant.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:27:08
I was thinking the same thing.  If  a fair amount of money moves in from Cyprus and they buy at the low.  It two years from now the countries worth will have greatly increase making even a greater case for adoption.

I've got money hitting my bank tomorrow and I'm only verified on coinbase.

As a merchant I'm more excited about the prospect of my factory in China accepting Bitcoin than my customers.  
I'm happy to allow my customers to pay me in Bitcoin, however, I'm more excited about not having to go the bank and wait in line 45 minutes to wire money.  
Right now I have to go the the bank twice every 3 months:
Wire 30% to factory for $45
Wire consultant fee to my guy on the ground $45
back one month later, wait in line again and wire the remaining 70% and pay anther $45
Daily personal transactions are great but wait until it is common place for us to use Bitcoin for BIG transactions that happen every couple of months to rebuild inventories.

The coins aren't lost.  They either have them or they were stolen.  They didn't disappear.  
The real question is if they were stolen, have the thieves dumped them on the market already resulting in the low prices we are seeing or are they holding them and selling them off slowly which would keep the price down for awhile.  
The other option is the are solvent and the start cashing out people which in turn could lead to a huge sell of from old Mt. Gox customers that are now scared of Bitcoin.  
Not to sound cold but for those of us holding Bitcoin outside of Mt. Gox the first scenario would be best.

I'm a new reddit user, and I'm glad I finally joined in.  optimator999 and Lukifer comments were both beautiful.

This kits are for "off road" use only.  Anything over the stock horn is technically illegal to use.  The ticket is like getting cited for having your music to loud at a party.

Forget about the INC part and focus on being an owner and promoter of a game changing technology.  
I love the idea of growing my net worth by owning a asset that empowers the poor instead of exploiting them.  
Exciting Stuff.

Maybe I've missed it but I'd like to see running totals of currency moving in day, week, month and year

I agree, that's why I asked what I was missing.  Its seems that people that have access to an exchange/wallet service that have the ability to buy coins and sell them to people who would like to use them to say transfer money to their family in Central America that don't have access to the traditional banking system.  
I feel that selling above a certain markup is unfair, but at the same time you are providing a service.  The current weighted average price is 622, if I bough in at this price what do you feel would be a fair market for time/risk taken on.

I was wondering the same thing.  I see articles saying "a post on reddit is moving up the price on the exchanges".  Just how much USD volume is needed to move the market say 10%

smoking too much weed is like owning too many bitcoins.
