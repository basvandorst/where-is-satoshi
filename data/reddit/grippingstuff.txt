Whew! I'm just about breaking even right now. Bought a little too much too early in the dip.

How kind of you! No one's bothered to mock my beliefs before and I least expected it to happen on Reddit of all places.

Are you even trying? Or is that really the best you've got?

I'm muslim, from South Africa though so a little culturally mixed.  I've been investing since September last year.
One thing I know about Islam, is that we are not supposed to contribute money to anything haram, which is why many banks offer a Shariah banking option here, where they basically promise to never lend our money to like alcohol and pornography companies and whatever else is haram. 
Whether or not they stick to it, I don't know. When have banks ever really been held accountable for anything. I think that's been the concern with cryptocurrency though, that it's being used by drug cartels and whatnot. 
I don't think there's been real concern about the gains itself. Like some people will tell you that earning/charging interest is haram. While other's will say it's only discouraged.
I don't mean to offend anyone perhaps more religious than me, but when it comes to technology, we kind of have to play it by ear because it's not like any of this stuff is specified in the Qur'an. Some people decide for themselves, other's wait for some sort of religious authority to tell them what to do.
