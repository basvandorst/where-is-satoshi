I registered on Dec 17. I'm still waiting to be verified. I don't think a service is that great if I can't even use it.

Dogecoin has way faster transaction times.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:02:16
I don't know man... I'm afraid to say I changed a lot of my Bitcoins for Dogecoin recently.
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:33:14
What competition do you speak of? Don't they have a monopoly right now?
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:41:33
Thanks for the reply. I hope FinCEN can get it's act together.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:05:28
How about VoS just opens up a shop IN the US and become a US entity?
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:40:34
This is an incorrect assumption. There was recently a survey in the Dogecoin subreddit, most Dogecoin users are between 20 to 35.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:31:45
Dogecoin has a lower inflation than Bitcoin until 2017.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:41:08
Can't VoS hire a lawyer to deal with this situation in regards to complying with FinCEN?
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:06:20
High risk, high return.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:32:41
Well they have this new thing called IPv6...

Where are you getting the data to display?
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:09:21
I don't know. Feels like he's laughing at me haughtily.
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:20:39
Does VoS have ACH deposit/withdrawal?
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:12:07
Do you know what TigerDirect needs? They need to sell Bitcoin so Coinbase has some more competition!
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:30:15
Can we get an update on this?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:29:48
This is why I hang out on the Dogecoin subreddit now. Attitude.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:25:59
I've had weird withdrawal issues with Cryptsy. For example if I request a 1000 Dogecoin withdraw they only send 250 to my external wallet and 750 is returned to the Cryptsy wallet. I had to request withdrawal multiple times to get all my coins. I'm worried that Cryptsy could gox people up.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:12:22
Man, I've been thinking the same thing! I'm a programmer in the Pittsburgh PA area if anyone is interested... ;)
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:26:10
I can see you're a wonderful and charming representative of your community. ::sigh::
I'll be telling my friends who have hundreds of Bitcoins to go to Dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:47:26
Approx 13.7 million per day. Even though it's an inflationary currency, the value of Dogecoin should go up considerably in time due to massive user influx because 13.7 million a day is a drop in the ocean since the base static total is 100 billion.
@_date: 2014-01-18 04:41:11
Any date on when it'll be possible to buy shares?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:45:00
Oh, ok. Well, Dogecoin has a nicer community.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:58:22
Vault of Satoshi currently supports a USD/DOGE market.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:27:05
$5 million per state is just crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:36:26
Well, I like keeping my money in Bitcoins and Litecoins because they go up in value over time while my dollars go down in value over time.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:47:28
Yeah, I've been trying for 5 days now. It's just ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:56:22
It's backed by the people that use it.

They require a full SSN which turns people off here in the US.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:16:09
Where is the private key? What does it look like?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:19:31
Ah, interesting. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:17:15
I live in Pittsburgh and can trade you 2 Bitcoins if you're interested in meeting up.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:39:19
Taxes. If I sell for fiat how do I know how much I have to pay in taxes? If it's considered a currency, I have to pay 40%. If it's a commodity I have to pay 28% if I held for less than a year or 15% if I held more than a year. This is really inconvenient because I'd have to keep track of everything and nothing is decided.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:54:26
TL;DR - Never forget where we come from and make the world a better place to live with your new found Bitcoin wealth.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:39:37
Thank you for explaining so thoroughly. Here's an upvote for you sir.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:32:49
If it's below $1000, I'd say you still got it cheap. I think a lot of people are waiting on the sidelines (including myself) for it to drop a little so we can scoop up more Bitcoins. It seems a better strategy is to just buy what you can on a regular basis (makes more money) than waiting for a drop.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:24:55
What does ATH stand for?
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:25:09
Oh, that's a good idea. I guess it's harder to keep safe than a text based key but that's better than nothing. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:48:42
Ah, interesting. Thanks I'll try it out.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:21:26
Wow! How did you make the API app for limit orders?
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:37:59
Wow, as of this writing it's trading at $3176/BTC and $150/LTC
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:15:30
What site is this?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:39:07
Who made Blockchain.info and is it US based?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:42:07
I'm mostly worried about thieves and stability of the site. I don't want to keep it on my computer because it's getting old and the harddrives could die. Maybe I should get USB drives... :P
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:01:48
I'll try this out. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:34:36
You need to provide a full SSN to cash out of kraken which is insane though.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:17:30
I'm looking around but I don't see a way to buy Bitcoin. Can you point out how where I should be looking?
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:40:34
If the clause is not reasonable, you can still sue and win.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:43:06
I heard good things about Electrum. Is this considered a cold storage?
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:28:05
You're not going to get a lot of positive responses here in the Bitcoin subreddit. That said, I would recommend trading in some of your Bitcoins for Litecoins. I am currently holding both coins and Litecoins are going up in value faster than Bitcoins. In the end the markets will decide who the winner is, and by diversifying your investments, your bets are somewhat safer even if one of them fails.
Litecoin is a younger crypto so it is definitely riskier however getting in on the early stages guarantee the highest returns when, if ever, it is successful. Bitcoin is still in it's early stages too though it is more mature compared to Litecoin, so it is relatively a safer bet, however the chances of making a killing are also smaller because the people that got in early are the ones that benefit the most.
The main reason people are getting into Litecoin is that a lot of people made a lot of money with Bitcoin. History tends to repeat itself. Why not make a whole bunch of money with Litecoin too?
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:42:33
I'm actually looking for a bar chart that someone on made. It shows Bitcoin returns at 2700% or something while all other asset classes are tiny.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:26:11
I bought a Bitcoin there that's supposed to come in on Thursday. I'm not too worried because Coinbase seems legit and we know who they are. I hope they're up soon though.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:51:27
Are they accessible through the US?
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:20:53
Is it possible for me to use even if I live in the US?
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:34:54
I have a large portion of my money in Bitcoins and Litecoins. It'd be nice to be able to pay with them.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:30:46
Thanks for the reply! Here's an upthumb!
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:32:56
I have provided my credit card information a week ago and that also says pending. The only thing I haven't been able to do yet is the question verification system. I've been trying everyday for almost a week now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:41:13
I like this idea and it's easy to understand.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:00:10
They're probably sleeping. It's like 4 am over there.
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:17:32
Which exchange is typically the cheapest place to buy?
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:42:07
What's SR?
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:39:48
Man, that is an awesome story. I've been talking with my coworkers about Bitcoin and they've been listening and a few of them have been considering creating an account. It still seems like the barrier to entry is high because buying Bitcoins off the exchange takes so much time just to get setup and verified. I think the way you're doing it, by giving them an actual experience first hand, could be an excellent way to go to get new people in to it. Thank you for sharing your story! :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:35:33
I'm honestly looking for an answer. A large portion of my money is in Bitcoins AND Litecoins.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:02:21
But the dude is paying in Venezuela currency...
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:25:50
That's really cool! Where are you getting the data though?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:04:44
I want to pay taxes. The question is how much am I supposed to pay? Keeping track of everything is hard and if I overspend I could be screwed. Please read what I wrote.
Edit: I've read that people that win the lottery go bankrupt because they forget about paying their taxes. If they won $100 million dollars they have to give the IRS like 40% of it. However they spend like 70% of it (they still have $30 million in the bank) and then tax season comes along and they lose everything including their home.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:46:13
Man, that site has more than a thousand ads. Ad blocker was blocking 1000s of ads. :P

It'd be great if you supported Amazon gift cards.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:48:46
Is there a way to buy with credit card on Coinbase if I do have a verified bank account there?
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:30:18
Oh, I see. I thought people that are buying today are getting theirs within 10 minutes, or something along those lines, because I thought I read that someone was bragging that they got their Bitcoin from Coinbase immediately.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:28:52

I don't think these things are an exact science. In time I guess we'll see which bets pay off the most.
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:20:39
Aww.., that makes me a little sad. I'm actually one of those people that like to save the points endlessly so I never use them... For me it's more like a high score and I'm always curious what my rank is compared to everyone else.

Small claims court. You'll win pretty easily. Get other people to sign up against them too and you'll have a stronger case.

This is actually a good question. I'm also curious how OP is dealing with taxes.
