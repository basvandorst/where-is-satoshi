Well we aren’t rich or anything and I’m terrible with money so he sends it to my account as I need it so I don’t blow through cash. I told him I was bad with money &amp; we decided for our own good that he should handle the funds. When you’re in a long term relationship and sharing funds there are more things that you have to be more open about... like where the money is going. Just like the government wants to know where the money goes so they can run the country, my bf needs to know so he can run the household. He doesn’t make the same amount of money every week so it’s a little harder to budget. Idk we’ll figure it out but for now I just need to hide $150 man

Because I just said he looks at my cash app account history. My bank account is a different account all together. So I took money from cash app and cashed out to my bank then deposit $150 from my bank account (that my bf does not see) and deposited it into Coinbase.

He gives me money for everything except things for me like a new outfit every now and then or going out to eat. I realize we need to maintain and budget right but I’ll go crazy if I don’t get some good alone time where I can treat myself. I stay at home, take care of the kids, clean, cook, drive to appts, etc. I don’t have a break room at my job and even tho I can go in my pj’s doesn’t make it easier lmao I wish I could sit at a desk but I used to work in a daycare and saw some things that were awful and I will not go back to work until my children are old enough to go to school. Anyway, I don’t want to stress my husband out and explain all of this to him if I could just keep doing what I’m doing and we’re both happy. Some things are better left unsaid ����‍♀️

Do you know the answer to my original question or are you just curious about my relationship that has absolutely nothing to do with you?
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:47:27
There’s nothing wrong with my relationship. I want to spend money without having to explain myself. I’m a stay at home mom &amp; he works full time so I usually don’t mind. I do need my privacy every now and then though.

When u get married one day do you think you’re going to tell your wife every single last detail of your life? Because you won’t. It’s human nature to want privacy and independence.

No haha he doesn’t like banks. But I want my money on my card not cash so he puts it in my account for me.

I’m going to have to open a ticket. Last time this happened I had transferred $400 from my bank account and it got put on hold for three months before I could spend it I had called support so many times and by like the sixth time someone finally helped me

No usually I get everything I want and he’s a great dad and boyfriend but I want some stuff to be private. I would rather just spend this money without him knowing so I can still have my privacy. Also, he doesn’t look through it to see where I spend my money. We share my cash app account and even though it’s hooked up to my phone, a lot of the time we lay in bed and review the history together if we’re like talking about finances. It’s not like he’s being a dad lol

I did the bank account but it’s usually instant if I’m depositing money and not withdrawing it to my bank account. Now it told me my money is on hold for 17 days.
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:05:48
Look, I know my man. We’ve been best friends for 5 years lol. I know by the time the shit I ordered is here he won’t even be mad! He’ll actually be glad but I don’t feel like hearing him bitch until it gets here and then realizes he’s happy I got it and apologizes for bitching.
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:14:25
Well have you ever made a deposit of $150 with intentions of waiting 17 days to spend it? It doesn’t make sense. If I can’t spend the bitcoin I just want my money back but at this point that will take even longer.
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:58:33
Guess this is what I get for trying to hide money from my boyfriend
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:09:42
It’s not a bank account it’s a cash app and he sends me less than $500 a month so it’s not a big deal
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:29:02
Thanks lol idk I like to avoid unnecessary arguments if I can. I guess I like to have my cake and eat it too. Oh well. I’m a good gf, mommy, BFF. Can’t be perfect

He gives me cash and I put it in my bank account then transfer it into my cash app. I like using cash app for my finances bc I have bitcoin and cash right there &amp; it’s just easier to deal with in general. Plus I like having the cash app debit card. I’ve had three debit cards from my bank in the past two years and they told me if I lose this one again that I can’t get a new debit card for another year. I don’t have to deal with that kinda thing w cashapp I can turn the card off if I lose it and just order a new one and it’s there in 3 days and I have a temp card to use until then that hooks up to my Apple Pay. There are fr so many reasons I prefer CashApp but I physically have to have a bank account to deposit the cash.

Yeah I don’t know why it’s talking dollars either? It was ACH.
@_date: 2019-02-19 07:45:34
He makes the money I stay home with the kids
@_date: 2019-02-18 19:12:34
I’m trying to withdrawal it to my other wallet. This is the error I get. [screenshot ](
