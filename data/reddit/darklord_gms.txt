Linux live CD &gt; Boot &gt; Electrum &gt; Import key/seed of the sending wallet &gt; make the transaction &gt; done. 
There's no risk with this method.

Sure bro. I love helping out the community. I know it's really frustrating when your transaction doesn't confirms after so long so I helped you out. :) 
If you need anything else, just let me know. :D
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:55:03
Yeah, Coinbase fees are pretty high. But don't worry! Gemini withdrawals are free. They pay the fees for you. That's why I love them. Best exchange ever.

So you have the 9.5k in Bitcoins or in the USD wallet? It might be possible to withdraw if you have the 9.5k in Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:56:56
Get your seed from Blockchain.info
Then open Electrum.
File &gt; New/Restore &gt; Next &gt; Next &gt; I already have a seed &gt; Type the seed you got from Blockchain.info &gt; Options &gt; BIP39 seed &gt; OK &gt; Next &gt; Next. 
Then click Tools &gt; Appearance and change the Base unit to BTC.

Hey, I just confirmed your transaction. :) 
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:57:28
You're making a fool of yourself. Just stop. He's right. You don't need a node to hold your Bitcoins. If you export your private keys you can import them to a mobile SPV wallet and avoid the hassle of running a 150+ GB node. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:32:20
Do you control/have the private keys for any of the receiving addresses? If you do, I can help you get it confirmed.

@_date: 2017-08-31 03:06:32
Gemini. Best exchange 
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:48:08


That means that if you imported a private key TO Blockchain.info wallet, then you can't back it up with the recovery seed.
If you got a 0 BTC balance then you don't have any balance on Blockchain.info or you didn't type the recovery seed incorrectly when Electrum asked for it
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:26:54
Great. I'll confirm it for you. It may take 0~12 hours. :) 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:15:42
I confirmed this one. I'm gonna confirm the other one soon.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:41:46
I'll PM you.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:48:36
Okay, there's a lot of misinformation in this comment.
Hash rate == block mining speed.
If the hashrate drops by 90% then it will take 90% more time to find a block so no, there won't be a block every 20 mins as you said. Not even today you can guarantee a block every 10~20 minutes. Sometimes it takes over an hour. 
If there's a sudden hashrate drop, then we will need an emergency difficulty adjustment otherwise Bitcoin price will drop a lot because of the slow confirmation times.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:13:37
They might fix that issue soon but if you can't wait, you can use Electrum to send the transaction.

Oh you shouldn't have done that because it was going to get confirmed anyways since I submitted it.

Check the difficulty increase here:
You can use this Bitcoin mining calculator that INCLUDES the rising difficulty unlike those Calcs from Coinwarz:
According to this calculator, assuming a ~15% difficulty increase every 2 weeks (2016 blocks) you will only get about $64 before the "lifetime" contracts becomes unprofitable and they cancel it. So you will lose $84.

This one is really good:
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:15:57
Worst experience I've had with an exchange. 
I tried to get verified. Sent an ID, my drivers license, my credit card, selfies with my license/card/ID. After a 2 weeks they said that I also had to send a passport. Well, I didn't have one so I said I couldn't send it so they were just like "get one or get lost" 
My advice? Stay away from them! Gemini is the way to go. Easier verification process and really fast. And you don't even have to wait for the money transfer to clear to actually buy. They credit the funds right away so you can buy the coins immediately. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:06:37

It takes a few days for verification to complete since they do it manually. It took me about 4 days. However they've never ask about anything else since then. I've heard Coinbase keeps asking for crap every once in a while.

Nice review! I really like Coinomi. I would love if they add a sat/byte fee option (just like the Blockchain.info android wallet) in the "Send transaction" tab so you don't have to go to Settings to change the fees. I honestly don't like the BTC/kb unit for fees.

No, but you can transfer the BTC to your Coinbase Vault and use their [multisig tool]( to set your own fees. Make sure to NOT use the recommended settings when setting up the Vault.
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:20:04


That's because they ask you for a high miner fee but the fee that they actually pay is waay lower. ;)

@_date: 2017-10-28 00:23:07
I'm not sure which website you're looking at but 85% of the hashrate power is still signaling NYA. When the legacy chain lose 85% of the hashrate and block generation time drops to 1 every 8~12 hours or maybe even more, people will just go buy Segwit2x coins because they'll be able to get a faster transaction/confirmation. That will drive the price up and the legacy chain price will go down. Never underestimate miner power.

Make sure to copy all the details they'll give you in a safe location. That's pretty much it. Then you transfer from your normal coinbase wallet to the Vault. This is free. It usually takes 10 to 20 minutes. You can keep checking with the tool. When you see that the balance is no longer zero when you use the tool then you're free to use that tool to send your coins to any address you want with any fee you want. You'll get a long hash code. Just copy it and then broadcast it at blockchain.info 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:27:18


I don't think this is the reason.  The mempool has a lot of unconfirmed transactions.

Only on the pc. You have to activate the Vault and use their tool to use it.
