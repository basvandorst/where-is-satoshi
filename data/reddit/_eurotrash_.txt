Use a closed water loop with a heat exchanger against the ASIC heatsink. Use a temperature sensor and a PWM controller for the water pump. Make it so that if the temperature is too high the pump goes off.
This be not your primary system for heating up the aquarium but just an auxiliary system to reuse waste heat from the ASICs.

Sure there are many ways to skin a cat. Coercion and education are the two opposite ends of the spectrum. In violent societies, using harsh punishment to prevent crime is a necessity today, but once you neglect education then you're left with an even more violent society tomorrow. I think Swedish society is well off today because in Sweden elementary education was made compulsory a few centuries ago.
To level the field it has to be said that no crime prevention approach is perfect. You have to deal with a certain amount of fail. E.g. the Breivik case in Norway comes to mind.

Paycoin is a premined scamcoin. Ripple XRP is a scamcoin.
This one instead, for now, is just an altcoin, still in vaporware stage. With some interesting properties re: governance.
It's not the first altcoin and not the last one that will try to be bitcoin 2.0. Competition is always to be expected, especially if bitcoin has weak spots that enable competition.
Besides, those devs are well known for their excellent work on an alternative bitcoind implementation. It's plausible that they are also frustrated with bitcoin and they think they could do better.

Not that I like it, but if they are handing out money then it makes sense to them to add an identity verification layer on-the-cheap through Facebook.

It would be interesting to know how likely EURs deposited at Coinbase by Greek citizens are to be legally affected by capital controls. If they aren't, then having a Coinbase account would be like having an offshore bank account.
The Greek government could indeed perform some form of capital controls by imposing a tax on any fiat transfer involving Coinbase. Something similar happens in Italy where the government retains 20% of any incoming fiat from abroad to private citizens' accounts (then it's up to the citizen to prove it was not income and ask for a refund).

Because, amongst the devs that matter, changing the block confirmation time to one minute is even a larger taboo than increasing the max block size.

Don't know why this is being downvoted. I wish bitcoin a lot of success as soon as possible, but at the moment this community is going lethargic. We're soon to drop below the top 200 subreddits. The hashrate has flattened out. # of transactions excluding long chains is actually decreasing, which to me means that coins are getting mixed better but again not enough new bitcoin users are coming.
There is a scalability problem that should be fixed before yesterday and I see lots of experts talk and no action. Reminds me of EU Parliament.

That is easier said than done for many.
Investing your wealth in bitcoin today is still a risky bet. And it was a much riskier one back then.
Imagine we're in June 2011 or in April 2013. Your net worth has gone up hundred-fold because of bitcoins. Suddenly you have millions worth of "real money" (lol) in the form of a very risky speculative asset: more money than you're ever likely to earn in your whole life. All this is happening while you live in a shared rented accommodation and have student loans to repay.
Then the bubble drops. Your millions become a few hundreds or tens of thousands, and there is no guarantee that bitcoin will make a comeback. Exchanges are dropping like flies. Ponzis and scammers and bad law enforcement news are all over the place. Suppose your coins are still in your hands: congrats, you have survived the many scams. But the price is dropping every day further. Can you take the pressure? Can you NOT cash out / buy a home / repay your loans before it's too late? This is where your beliefs are going to be tested.

This blog post was written in early June 2011 during the rise that ended with 2011's bubble pop. Also consider that, in the post, he forecasted the bitcoin Singularity event coming in three years. I'd say when he wrote that post, he had just gotten the new-paradigm fever during a parabolic price rise. The subsequent disappointment at bubble pop has claimed the fortunes of many early bitcoiners. Regarding whether he is rich now, I think that the most likely outcome is that he's burnt his cultist candle early during one of the 2011 or 2013 bubble pops - so he's sold out his stash for fiat since. I wouldn't even exclude the possibility he's some anonymous bitter buttcoiner by now.

One could argue that, in 2012, mining with ASICs was extremely profitable for a few players who had access to them with low CAPEX. Those miners could  afford to just sell a portion of their daily mined coins and keep the rest for speculation purpose, smoothing out the effect of the halving. Nowadays the hashrate is going flat, likely because we have achieved a balance between OPEX cost of mining a coin (in a country with cheap power) and market price. In this scenario, miners have to sell most of the mined coins straightaway to pay for power. Less stale coins in miners' hands leaves the market price more vulnerable to supply shortages.

I find that namecalling is unfair and slightly racist. Technically no act of thievery was committed here because the LGPLv3 license is designed to encourage building knockoffs: which is what they did. The license also requires the copiers to give credit to the original devs which they didn't.
But in defense of the author of the above post I also feel compelled to counterargue that in my own business experience most Chinese people in China do not rate high on the integrity scale: they would rather defend an obvious lie of theirs than admit to any wrongdoing ever.

While I think you are right that the hashrate will go down because most "small guys" will have to shut down, I think you are grossly overestimating the costs of mining a coin for the "big guys".
1. OPEX - If you are in Alaska or Iceland you get a stable power supply at a cost of 2-3 cents per kWh not 10 cents.
2. CAPEX - Companies do not pay retail prices. Even better if they can produce their own hardware and hence skip a few middlemen in the process.
If I had to pull numbers out of my ass, I'd bet there are some guys out there whose cost of mining a coin is in the low 100s.

TL;DR: XRP is a premined addition to the original Ripple idea which was not supposed to have any native currency. The "premine" part that makes it a scam - because even the best intentions fall apart when you are controlling the money supply, due to [human nature](
An old but concise summary of the scam/non-scam debate is [here](
Some XRP bag holder worries about XRP future [here]( Ripple Inc. seems to be moving away from using XRP for the purpose they originally included it for. Thus making it a useless pumpdumpcoin, after having profited from it.

Not so much? At current fees, I can do a thousand transactions in a block with a minimal fee of 0.0001 each. With MK's idea applied it then costs me only 0.1 btc to slightly increase maximum block size for every node.

On the contrary, all you own is an IOU from the bank. You're a creditor of the bank and only a part of that credit is insured against loss. Following the same line of reasoning I think that the ruling says that goxcoins are not bitcoins.

Quick reminder that "goxxing" is not a sudden event, but a game of musical chairs, and the music takes a while to stop. The plunge into darkness happens slowly. It all starts when some money goes missing, maybe because the exchange got hacked, maybe because it is operating at a loss: whatever the reason, next step is the exchange operator tries to save his business' ass by dipping into the users' funds. At the beginning he justifies himself saying he's just borrowing money, it's just a temporary measure. He thinks he can still recover the losses by just delaying some few big withdrawals until he has made some more money out of the exchange fees. We all know how this ends: users flee in droves and the late bunch in the stampede for the exit door get fleeced.
For MtGox the music took no less than 10 months, from April 2013 to February 2014.
IF iGot are broke and running a fractional reserve, they will scam selectively:
1. users outside the country they are based in, because those users are less likely to sue;
2. users with relatively big amounts. You screw one of them and you can keep serving a hundred other users with smaller amounts.
Apparently they can get away with it, for now.
TLDR: Enough warning signs of goxxing are there. GTFO.

This is no test.
We are under attack.
Someone is intentionally trying to slow down the network to a halt, crashing as many nodes/services/wallets as possible in the process.
This incident proves that it is reasonably cheap for someone to keep the network hostage of their dust transactions: a few thousand dollars a day to DOS-attack billions of market cap.
Re: Raising the block size. While it would make this attack 20x more expensive - which isn't much for someone willing to destroy bitcoin's ability to transfer value - it will fill up nodes with 20x more data, causing many more of them to slow down and crash.
Expect this kind of attacks to become the norm, like spam with email. Which means we will need the bitcoin equivalent of antispam solutions.
EDIT PLEASE READ re: my block size remark. Please read it as "increasing the block size is not enough" as opposed to "increasing the block size is wrong". E.g. Email servers have been upgraded to larger mailboxes over time, but sure those larger mailboxes are there to collect more messages not more spam.
EDIT2: better TLDR - for those who comment/vote on the TLDR without reading the full post.
TLDR: bitcoin network usability is being put under attack with a few thousand dollars per day; raising the block size alone would make such an attack use 20x more of all nodes' resources at 20x more cost. We need better antispam measures.

Let me try. This is just a guess because I'm too lazy to RTFM:
it's a real time visualization of the transactions that are being broadcast. 
Green dot = input, red = output, yellow = both input and output.
The blue little dot represents a transaction broadcast, which connects inputs with outputs.
E.g. A classic payment to an address involves using one or more inputs to send to one output. Therefore it will be a blue dot surrounded by a number of green dots and a red dot.
The simple rules above make it so that complicated chains of inputs and outputs (which reuse former outputs as inputs) are represented as wire-like or tree-like structures.

Define "robust transaction fee market".
* I don't see any transaction fee estimators in any wallet but a half-assed attempt in bitcoin core.
* I don't see full-rbf implemented - which allows for increasing fees of existing transactions in case the network is congested (well if you want a fee market, then you also need this one for proper feedback loops)
* I don't see child-pays-for-parent implemented either.
So: what exactly is this robust fee market you are talking about?

See I said bitcoin-only because there is a bank liquidity problem in Greece atm.
In order to overcome the shortage of euros in the banks, some companies are issuing private scrip notes, which is a terrible idea because 1. You have to trust the issuer 2. The scrip notes are easy to counterfeit 3. They are illiquid compared to cash or even bitcoin.
Whereas ideally bitcoin could help creating an internal closed-loop economy replacing the euro. While guaranteeing convertibility to euros at a premium, due to exchangers/arbitragers at the borders who are able to get euro cash for bitcoin.
What problem do bitpay/coinbase solve in this scenario? 1. They allow for euro denominated invoicing at semiofficial exchange rates. 2. They lower the barrier to entry to bitcoin (be it technology or trust) for both Greek and non Greek participants in the exchange of goods for value.

Can someone ELI5 here if this uses the bitcoin blockchain or not and, if not bitcoin, what is the reward that makes miners want to behave honestly when validating the participants' vote transactions in the blockchain?

Hernias are a serious matter! A spinal Gox hernia can leave you dealing with a sore backside until the end of your days.

A new president of the Bitcoin Foundation has been elected. As per r/Bitcoin tradition, let the shit throwing begin.

Thanks. In fairness their rates are good in the sense they're not anywhere as bad as the ones I found with ANX last time I checked (like 1-2% difference vs 7-8%). It looks like a service originally targeted to Russians (or maybe Russian-owned), officially headquartered in Belize, whereas the card issuer is, as you wrote, in Gibraltar. Looks dodgy to me but I suppose it's the price the owners have to pay to avoid complying with regulators. Sadly it also makes it easy for them to disappear with an exit scam if they want to. So buyer beware: handle with gloves. I wonder if they would issue cards in currency other than USD?

Keep quiet or it will hear you. Just pretend you don't care at all like the rest of us do.

It's the bitcointalk username and email they used. Which leaked when the bitcointalk database was hacked (at least twice) in 2013.

Let me make a wild guess: the hrvnya is sinking way faster than bitcoin's slow grind. So some Ukrainians are trying to jump ship by using bitcoin to convert their hrvnyas to dollars or rubles. The reaction of the government? Capital controls. Freeze bitcoin exchanges' accounts.

Mmmkay. Suppose I buy a flight or a laptop with this masked card. Suppose the flight or the shipment of the item is cancelled. How is the refund going to work?

Bet ya that username will be long gone by then

Thanks. I can see how having a single card number for each transaction also protects me better from credit card frauds. At the cost of having to trust the masked card issuer, having to pay the coinbase fees, having to write down the masked card numbers used in every transaction just in case things don't go smooth.
It's too much hassle for me personally but I think there is a market for this product. And with a bit of luck, the technology of issuing different credit card numbers for each transaction could extend the life of the obsolete but ubiquitous credit card based payment model.

I may have figured out a solution but I can't give it away without proper testing. If I tell you, I'll have to kill you.

No but I would make it look like I do.

Conspiracy speculation:
The packages all look the same.
They all were sent through the same courier.
They usually take different routes to different destinations.
They all were rerouted to the same place which is farther away from some of the destinations.
The delivery was delayed for at least one day.
... Better assume they are all bugged or worse, by now.

Did anyone else find himself logged out this morning? That might be a clue that something nasty happened to the backends &amp; maybe some data got lost and some backup had to be restored.

Password reset doesn't work for me either. Same issue.

That's incorrect. I know for sure there was only ONE notification email.
EDIT: to be fair, I let the term expire, so it's my loss. I don't hold a grudge to them and I don't care enough. But I have to call bullshit when I read it...
EDIT2: Thanks for downvote, your title is still incorrect.

I'd rather study the fitness devices' protocol, then record a few workouts, then I'd try impersonate the device by generating emulated workouts, each one consisting of a mix and match of real workouts, adding just a little randomness in the parameters with limited variance. That would give me a way lower chance of getting caught because my generated walking/cycling patterns would still make sense on a map and would have matching human heartbeat rates to go with them.
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:13:25
I would so spend my time hacking this app into believing I'm doing fitness. As opposed to me doing fitness. The former thing is more fun than the latter.

There is only ONE email titled "Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections", Mr. Downvoter. Whereas your title is "members were notified three times by email to activate for voting".
Newsletters and blog posts don't qualify.

I subscribe to that, and that's sad. The title is still incorrect 'tho.
