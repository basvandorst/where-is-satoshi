Asking if someone accepts bitcoin is not a sales pitch. You are making absurd assumptions on the exact scenario playing out. 
This is no different than asking your grocer to carry a product you consistently buy.
As a consumer you have tremendous power, act like it.

I wish we could troll Ver more. He is so funny when he gets angry. Haha

It you are seriously concerned. You have enough money you should hire an attorney that understands the UCC and bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:57:29
You must be using it wrong.

Further when the shitcoins do implode that money is not going to be going back into USD it is going to flee to Bitcoin.

Because there is not sufficient demand. 
Why would I as a business owner waste time on something I dont know my customers care about.
A great money machine in recent history is based off business owners wanting to know every detail about their customers interests.
So why not open you mouth and tell them. Create the demand and they will start to offer.

Run your own node and choose the coin you agree with.

It's not about banks or LBC. It is about 31 USC 5330.
31 USC 5330(e)(1)  Any person who fails to comply with any requirement of this section or any regulation prescribed under this section shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of $5,000 for each such violation.
If you act like a big fish and transmit a lot of money they will be coming for you!

True economic contribution! ��

That is fine. But the intelligent person or persons who are responsible for Bitcoin are smart enough to die responsibly.
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:51:57
That's true.
@_date: 2018-07-31 01:36:39
Well most merchants I talk to are interested in learning more and a few have made it available to me and friends. 
No harm in asking. All I'm saying.
@_date: 2018-07-31 04:34:24
Please do provide your data sets, statistics, or monte carlo simulatations to support your predictions. It is important so we can all be informed. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:50:02
That's good.

This is it. When 10 turns to 100 we will have arrived at the moon.

Stop spreading lies. Shots are covered in cash no BTC is used.
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:38:35
Dont trade such large amounts.

Maybe he/she/they wrote an advanced protocol to transfer the coins at a set date or trigger. Perhaps when the time is right Bitcoin will become the great equalizer it was ment to be, something that can only happen after mass adoption. 
Those coins will serve a very special purpose. The grand finale of Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:45:42
Funny how people forget we are stil are at version 0.16.xx and updates will always be coming. ��
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:14:30
They are lying to you. Their credit score will not be impacted. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:39:28
You are making multiple assumptions. Including an assumption that Satoshi would be stupid enough to die without a dead man's switch for the coins.
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:38:54
It does have a long way to go. 0.16.2 is young. 
The barriers are easy to overcome with simple education. Remember you dont need to know how blockchain works to use it anymore. You are downloading an app. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:02:09
They increase prior to runups lol
@_date: 2018-07-31 01:35:10
It's not about LBC. It's about avoiding law enforcement. You will get nailed for breaking banking laws. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:56:09
That is a stupid comparison.
At it's very core Bitcoin's value is derived from those who CHOOSE to put value in it.
You can't choose to put value in something you don't know exists.

KYC gives banks the responsibility to ask, which just goes to show KYC has racist undertones. 
KYC allows banks to intentionally exclude poor minorities.
Poor minority communities are fertile ground for cryptocurrencies because the banks refuse to treat them equally.
In BoA's mind a black or brown person must always justify from where they received their cash.
