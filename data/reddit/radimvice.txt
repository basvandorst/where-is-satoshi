There are several addresses containing 50k Bitcoins with public, verifiable evidence that they were at one time controlled by Gox and that haven't been transferred to any other "innocent people" since. See eg:  and 
So first, these coins would not be taken from 'your wallet', they would be taken from the idle accounts Mark supposedly no longer has control over. Second, I'm not proposing the network 'give them back to mark', i'm proposing that they be returned to a trusted authority such as the bankruptcy trustee, who would assign them back to the defrauded users directly.

AFAIK, there is nothing technically preventing a consensus of Bitcoin network nodes from 'seizing' a Bitcoin address by collectively assigning the coins within such a "lost" blockchain address to a designated trustee for distribution to users with legitimate claims. The only barrier to gathering such a consensus among the Bitcoin nodes to make an effective intervention are entirely social/political.

The alternative (inaction) is basically agreeing that these coins better belong in the hands of whoever is behind this massive fraud (e.g. hackers, or possibly Karpeles), than the hundreds of thousands of defrauded users. Why the hell would we do that? Then we are no better than pirates stealing money at gunpoint from legitimate businesses when they feel like it.

Isn't it technically feasible for the Bitcoin community to collectively modify the blockchain to restore stolen bitcoins to a trusted address, as long as a consensus is reached among a majority of active nodes in the network? The blockchain has been successfully forked in the past through coordinated action among developers, mining pools, and so on. I am very surprised that key Bitcoin players haven't been clamoring for this sort of action in response to the fraudulent disappearance of such a large amount of coins.
Doing nothing and allowing such a large percentage of fraudulently-obtained Bitcoins to remain in control of unknown entities (or wiped out entirely) can't be good in the long-term for anyone trying to support the use of Bitcoin for legitimate business. There's an opportunity here for the Bitcoin Foundation to work with law enforcement, financial institutions, etc. to track and restore the stolen bitcoins to their legitimate owners (not Gox but its users) that they have not expressed any interest in so far. For a loss of this magnitude affecting so many users, to turn a blind eye to this is simply unethical.

You seemed to miss the moral of the trolley problem. It doesn't show that the psychological bias toward inaction is ethically sound, but the opposite: that "our instincts only feel deep; in fact, they are fickle and easily manipulated," the point being that ethical deliberation sometimes runs contrary to our emotional instinct, our instinct is not necessarily right.
And my point about your bogus example was just that the statistical [societal cost of murder]( is completely different from the statistical marginal cost of averting a death through public health, so comparing the two has nothing at all to do with action/inaction because the costs are not at all the same to begin with.
I honestly believe that this strong conservative bias against any reasonable form of protocol-level intervention, however large the impact on its economy, is a great limitation the Bitcoin community will need to overcome if it is to grow into a long-term stable economic system capable of handling catastrophic failure in a flexible manner.

Before seriously arguing that causing harm through inaction is somehow ethically more justified than causing equivalent harm through action, see "Parmenides Fallacy."
And as for your bogus $2000 example, the number I've seen most often quoted for the value of a statistical life is around $7 million (at least for U.S. workers), which would change the situation somewhat.

There are five Bitcoin addresses containing around 200k unspent BTC combined, all deposits coming from three consecutive transaction blocks ( 11/16/2011 05:38:46, 05:45:03, 05:59:08).

[1cXNTyXj4xPGopfYZNY5xfSM1EPJJvBZV]( (40k)
Most of these addresses are linked in some form or another to the 424k "proof" transaction that Karpeles performed on IRC on 6/23/2011. Also, a transaction moving 500k Bitcoins into a single address, presumably the rest of Mt. Gox's wallet at the time, was executed within the same transaction block ( This is all quite strong evidence that these five addresses totaling 200k unspent BTC are all (or were at some point) under direct control of Karpeles.
There is also another address containing around 69k unspent BTC, formed by a transaction on 04/09/2013 and unspent since then, that nobody knows too much about. Some speculate that it had something to do with Mt. Gox halting its trades the next day, amid claims of server overloads and DDOS attacks.

While these addresses don't add up to the entire 800k claimed to be missing, it still is a pretty notable stash of Bitcoins that is linked to Mt. Gox and has been largely sitting in one place for several years.
