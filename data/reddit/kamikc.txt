You could invest your deposit, meaning that you didn't use it for gambling but to lend it to JD, who would then use your deposit as collateral, making you a stakeholder of a fraction (your investment/total investments) of its losses or gains while you were investing.

I must agree with most of the things you say. But still, that's quite some dogmatism right there. Who decides who's a *real* slave and who is not?

WTF? 22 upvotes, no downvotes, and is just plain fucking wrong. Source: I'm Swiss.
- I never heard of "extensive training in guerilla warfare".
- I am definitely not required by law to receive firearms training.
- I am definitely not required by law to own plenty of ammunition (seriously, where did you get this info, WTF).
- While there is an obligatory military service that every Swiss male citizen has to go through (except you have a medical certificate that says you can't do it - easy to get, by the way), you can always **choose to not carry a gun**, or just apply for civil service.
Last September, Swiss citizens voted against an initiative to abolish this obligatory military service with ~73%. Still, that means that every fourth citizen that voted on this issue was for the abolishment (this position is even more spread among those who didn't bother to go to vote).
EDIT: Even your "Oh," part in the end is wrong. Since the invention of airplanes, rockets and bombs, mountains aren't that much of a help anymore, and Switzerland's major cities are in the lowlands and thus very close (like 40 fucking inches close, see the examples) to the borders of France (Geneva, Basel), Germany(Basel) and Italy(Lugano).

Keynes' goal was to set up an economic system that distributes wealth and income as equally as possible among the members of a nation through permanent fiscal and pricing policy. This should then increase the general spending capacity, which he considered to be the fuel and guarantor of a growing economy.
According to this concept the state *is* offering a service, namely to ensure the wealth of the general population and thereby ensuring the functioning of the economy.
So, while I may agree with your term of 'artificial employment', I don't see how this is work for the sake of work.


I don't have the time to search it now, but didn't Keynes actually assume that employment and working hours would constantly shrink away because of the massive increase in productivity and the adoption of human work by machines? He predicted that the average person would maybe work 8 hours *a week* at the end of the 20th century (and oh was he wrong!).
To accuse Keynes of simply wanting all humans to be employed and everything else would settle down automatically is exactly the sort of sterile name-calling Mendoza complains about.

When you click on 'Bitcoinity Markets' you can choose (on their site) between mtgox, btce, bitstamp, bitcoin24 and bitfloor. The 'Mt. Gox Queue' is really just for the latest queue count. But you are right, order some things with dropdown would definitely be a good idea!

Never heard of devcoin before, but I'll read myself into it! And yes, a logo like this can be done through edging, but it will cost you a lot more than a simple engraving on the blade. That's because it's a different kind of process (edging instead of engraving).

They explain to the interviewer what Bitcoin actually is and how mining roughly works (they make comparisons to finding gold or prime numbers). Also, why it is a win-win situation for both participators of the transaction (faster, cheaper, no middleman) and why the safety of your Bitcoins depends on yourself and how you can protect them sufficiently. They tell her how sellers use services like BitPay to receive $/EUR at the end of the day. Finally the one on the left says that Bitcoin has to be regulated in order to being implemented on a broad scale, and that in a democracy one should be able to choose which form of currency one wants to invest in.

Withdrawals from Mt.Gox have low limits and take a lot of time. So if you have money stored on Mt.Gox, you rather want to exchange it for Bitcoins because you probably can't withdraw the money anyway (at least not all of it in a short time frame). Hence the higher price that people are ready to pay.

I wouldn't (and haven't) contradict(ed) your argument that the American tax payer is hiring hitmen by the action of paying taxes,  I simply emphasized that he or she does that *passively and possibly unknowingly*.
This is where accountability / responsibility *is* important, because you asked your initial question as a rhetorical one, therefore suggesting there is *no difference at all*. 
Of course you can have that opinion but I for my part am glad that most legislations (EDIT: and people of course) around the world take this difference into consideration (negligence and deliberate intention).

The goal was to pack a lot of information about Bitcoin in order to make it easy to get a daily overlook of latest Bitcoin developments. It's my first website and I'm not yet able to code, but anyhow I will try to learn more and more so I can make adjustments, improve the design and import more info from other sites (like bitcoincharts / bitcoinmonitor / listentobitcoin / suggestions?). I will actively search for any update on the Mt. Gox queue count and publish it on the website. Also, I took the recently suggested Ƀ as a favicon, what do you think of that? I'm grateful for any constructive feedback.

I'd say there can be quite a big difference, but that depends from case to case.
Someone who isn't educated well enough to know what's going to happen with his taxes can hardly be made responsible for *wanting people to die*, though if he knowingly hires a hitman, you can easily argue that he *wants people to die*.
Take yourself as an example. If you live in the USA, I take it you pay taxes. Are you by this action really willing to accept the death of other people in the same manner as you are willing to accept it when hiring a hitman? If so, why do you pay your taxes?
@_date: 2013-08-16 12:05:16
Bear in mind that to make something illegal you have to write a law in which the 'thing' that you want to make illegal has to be described specifically and sufficiently. How is that gonna work with Bitcoin? What is it that you are gonna make illegal?
* All forms of currencies that aren't backed by a central bank?
* Any electronic payment system that isn't owned by a private corporation?
If the law ought to be more specific than these two points, then it will be very similar to the so-called designer drugs market: If you forbid the use of a specific substance (with other words: a specific chemical composition), a few days later a very similar substance with just a tiny change in its chemical composition will legally be available on the market again.
