People have to buy at that price before the supply is used up and must buy higher, which then raises the price, which is good for holders!

Again you fuck. They passed a tax bill to attack "entitlements" next. They are going to trot out, "We just don't have the money." like you are now! It's like you don't have any foresight. What happens when you put your hand on a hot stove?
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:33:20
Yeah, that money goes straight to the for-profit model. That's an excuse they sell you, so they continue to gouge you. "research" dollars going to their yachts. They are lying to you and you're gullible enough to believe it!
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:04:17

Jesus Christ man. You really are that dumb. It's not just talking about projected numbers. Many poor people didn't have health insurance before Obamacare/ACA. GTFO. 
Wrong. You're talking about a totalitarian regime, not communism. Trump is trying to be a dictator in our capitalistic society, but we have democratic checks. 
We shouldn't have to go bankrupt due to lack of ability to pay huge medical bills due to the free market! That's insanity!

Blocksize is a big one. BCH has larger blocksize than BTC. This enables faster and more transactions but centralizes the coin further. The whole point of BTC is that it is decentralized! The other big one is BTC has a community of coders working on improving it on github (the lightning network is coming), while BCH has zero. There are real problems with BTC right now with high transaction fees, however Roger Ver (BCH advocate he controls) is not the person to solve these problems. He has a shady history and associates with even shadier associates. Tread carefully!
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:10:42
I don't care about politics. I care about the future of this country and you are intentionally enabling Putin to buy out our democracy. You're a moron who has the internet. More than half this country hates Trump. Mueller, a Republican war hero, got rid of the bad optics. You're hanging on to this talking point because it's all you got and you're being paid well in a social media farm in Russia. Fuck you.

Thanks! I read up on it and it says exactly this. Thanks for verifying.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:43:36
No. It's what Mueller is investigating and there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that you are willfully ignoring. You fucking Russian shill. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:13
You can IMMEDIATELY add USD to your account and spend it IMMEDIATELY on BTC or ETH. The trick is you just bought it on credit and you can't move the BTC or ETH off the exchange until the USD clears your bank account. You can still sell the BTC and ETH though while the USD is clearing. Way better though because you can buy dips! There's a $500/day limit though. That might be able to be changed. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:45
Yes. Gemini covers network fees. The only reason not to use Gemini is because you haven't heard of it until now, so no reason!
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:26:00
Right, but if coinbase accounts for much of the movement of BTC, then it is in your personal interest to keep their fees down if and when you want to move you BTC from a personal wallet to an exchange. You pay this fee. So, it's indirect, but you do benefit if Coinbase pays less. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:36:31
Why does no one ever speak about the 100s of millions of people Capitalism has killed? Just this year, 10s of thousands will die because they lack modern healthcare. There's a war in the Middle East that is still ongoing - a million plus have died. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:24:25
No fee to transfer from Coinbase to GDAX and vice versa. This transfer is not on the blockchain. It's internal. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:19:31
Oh, I don't know if you can do that. If you personally own both wallets, you can at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:09:48
Yes it did. America's power rests on the petrodollar, so we meddle in areas that are none of our business. If we pursued other sources of energy, not the ones dictated by our current status quo infrastructure, we would never be there in the first place. Furthermore, much of the fighting is done by contractors at this point. In other words, we are at war to enrich and entrench our capitalism. 
There was a study done that Bernie cited that estimated how many Americans would die approximately per year without health insurance. 
I await your rebuttal. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:21:38
You're intentionally being deceptive. Trump-ists are smart enough to do this all too often. Land doesn't vote, people do.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:38
He is intentionally deceptive. There are real problems with Bitcoin but his band-aid solution isn't a permanent fix. He's also a raging asshole. A simple example, he owns r/BTC even though his abbreviation is BCH. Now, why would someone want to be deceptive like that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:09:43

I may have found the person dumber than Trump. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:48:35
You're dismissing things you simply don't understand. I'm not going to do your homework for you. This is a conversation, not a thesis. Both of those things I said are true. They are easily "google-able". For example, "bernie + healthcare + 10,000 people". You need to take a step back and self-reflect on what you think you know and be self-critical. When you are ready to be objective, I'll rejoin this conversation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:36
The answer is dependent on when he bought it.

You're a lackwit propagandist. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:32:12


Which will be cut due to the unfunded giveaways to the wealthy. 
Canada is a modern country with socialized medicine. We can follow Canada's example because we clearly aren't a leader anymore. Fatness is a symptom of modern lifestyle, the same countries that also have socialized medicine. 
You would excuse anything to justify robbery from the people by the elite. You're a useful idiot. You might not deserve better healthcare, but your neighbors do. You would have us suffer.

You're complicit in the death of Americans. Kudos. Here's another one where capitalism doesn't get the blame.

How do you mask the BTC eventually being transferred to your main wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:33:26
Right, but when you want to move from your wallet back to the exchange, it is your problem. You're being intentionally dense. You get this. :/

@_date: 2018-05-23 19:37:30
What's never cited is the number of people killed due to capitalism. You could argue the war for oil in the middle east that has killed millions. The wars that propped up empires in the last few centuries. The lack of healthcare that kills 10,000s a year. etc. The lack of air quality regulations due to untethered capitalism. Climate change! You're very disingenuous or just a tool.  Also, that source is not neutral.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:43:19
Maybe that's what the discussion was about? Can you?
@_date: 2018-08-15 12:55:50
Well, in that case, we'd all be dead. Money won't really be a concern. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:39:59
Yes, they can because they would use fractional reserves. The amount loaned would be real, but on their books, the stored bitcoin for the users would not be "real", only backed by a promise that it would be real when withdrawn.

@_date: 2017-11-12 19:59:25
Gdax/Coinbase is reputable. The only reason people say exchanges aren't safe is that you don't physically own the private key to your bitcoin. An analogy is giving your money to the bank. You are trusting that the bank doesn't go out of business and you can withdraw your money at any time. If Coinbase/Gdax goes under (MtGox went under a couple years ago), you're SOL. Usually, the amount of security you care about is proportional to how much money is invested. If it's only a couple hundred. Leave it in the exchange. If you're in the thousands, maybe invest in your own private hardware wallet. However, you are now in charge of your own security and if you lose your key or 24-word passcode you are screwed. There's also no easy way to pass on any bitcoins if you die and only you knew the pass phrase or key. We are in the wild west of the crypto future. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:38:52
Yeah, and if it's only a few hundred dollars on your end, just leave it on the exchange. Hardware wallets are about $100 and the route you want to go if you put in $1000+s. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:28:57
Thanks a lot! I think I get it. 
Why did you click on Segwit2x? Isn't BTC "core"? Up top there are three options Segwit2x, Core, and Cash. I thought Segwit2x doesn't exist yet?

Gemini has small fees and let's you buy on credit up to $500 per day. You can't withdraw until the money clears your bank account though. Maybe look into them? A $500 market order right now is: $500 = $498.76 (BTC) + $1.24 (fee).

If only you could predict the future! /s Don't be too hard on yourself.

Safe-ish for an exchange, however you should get a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:52:12
No idea then. I'm sure there's a way though because I just did it through my hardware wallet. I can't help you. I'm sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:31:22
Well, everyone has a different opinion. I for one like the idea of an inflation-resistant currency. I hope cryptocurrency is this, so I'm a long-term holder. Others are trying to day-trade. It's up to you. I'd suggest reading up on the technology on the sidebar and think longer term like me. I've chosen Bitcoin because it seems the most competent, but I'm starting to look at other alts.

No, we are saying they aren't sincere. If money didn't bring them happiness, they wouldn't care if they had it or not, yet they keep their money. Their actions speak louder than words. The truth is there is AT LEAST some happiness to be derived from financial stability.

Nothing could go wrong then!
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:53:12
That's an interesting point. We gain happiness from accomplishment. The point, though, doesn't negate that I will never hear a rich person say, with an honest heart, money wouldn't make me happier right now to solve some of my problems. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:54:15

Way to be deceptive and "randomly" choose 20. They are 26 or 9, depending on the list, and among one of the first modern, westernized countries to make it on the list. 
In other words, you're a liar.

That's too simple. Socialism can work other places like in North Europe. The problem in Venezuela is just the crashing oil price. It wasn't sustainable.

lol, I doubt you are telling the truth. The evidence is there, you're just ignoring it because you are a moron. I'm going to lead you to water, but you won't drink. Cases take time to make. You don't raid a RNC office off a hunch.

Every time I hear life is about happiness, I hear it from a rich person. It's very disingenuous.

Hunger is very real and directly related to money. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:05:17
No, it just helps prove that the only people who say, "Money doesn't buy happiness, are already wealthy." It's a sick joke. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:07:28
You're narrowing on a phrase for some reason. Most Americans will never own much. It helps more people to ensure the majority are taking care of, not the wealthiest. I'm glad you take those risks, and you're rewarded financially. You don't need to be further rewarded at the cost of not having Medicare for All.

Nah, the reason matters because it shows some reasons are okay to increase the debt and others aren't for "some inexplicable reason". Read this as, if it benefits me, we can increase the debt, so this just ties back into what I was saying. Republicans don't actually care about anything, except tax cuts for the wealthy (not you).
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:52:19
Yeah, no. We have owners and laborers and a mix of the two. Wealth gained from being an owner is not the same as the blood and sweat of an hourly wage. We should be taxing the billionaires more than normal people to pay for children's teachers, fire fighters, roads, police, healthcare, and so on.

Because people are complex and find unhappiness other ways. When money can feed you, cloth you, keep your heater on, and put a roof over your head. Yes that is happiness. Could you still be a miserable son-of-a-bitch? If you're so sure, give up all your money and live paycheck to paycheck. See how it feels.

Nationalism should be criticized because it is never rooted in being "independent" or whatever excuse you want to throw at it. It's not and you are either naive or willfully ignorant. It is almost always rooted in racial identity being better than another racial identity. I would not have to say nationalism wasn't usually about racism if the groups who champion it have a history of being violent against people who don't look like them.

Indeed and it's arguably made our war machine effecient at killing them. Also, for some reason health care has to be profitable instead of a public good like the rest of the modern world leading to a lack of healthcare for the average person.

Sure I agree with you there. The thing is, free market capitalism is a pipedream. It won't ever exist. As soon as a company becomes successful, they entrench their position against competition. The government should be one of many forces to break these monopolies up. You might say "commonism looks good on paper" and I would say, "free market capitalism is impossible".

Pal, you're right. And my argument is that regulator entrenchment is *inevitable*. That is what happens. There is no such thing, except on paper, as pure capitalism with healthy competition. It doesn't exist without regulations to break up monopolies. If regulations are going to happen, they may as well be to create healthy capitalism with a side of public good.
