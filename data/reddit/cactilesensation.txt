This sounds like a great way to get arrested in whatever country you live in for being an unregistered exchange/money services business.

The idea of setting up shops to accept bitcoin is great, but you don't want to be exchanging it to fiat for them and whoever may be shopping at their store.

Kraken will happily screw you over with no warning, closing your account and leaving your funds trapped in limbo. Be thankful that you ran into problems with them before your money got involved. There is no reason to send your money or crypto to Kraken, ever.  Coinbase supports the deposit verification method, and if you buy using Coinbase Pro, the fees are minimal. Don't use their standard interface, you'll get a bad rate.

They have a great reason. Free money for them! Clearly you've never dealt with Paypal.

if your phone is rooted you can transfer the authenticator database to your computer with ADB and open the file with DBLite.

For gold, a fake coin will have a different density, so if you're serious you can compare the exact weight to the exact exterior dimensions. This is very difficult to fool unless somebody cores the bar/coin and fills it with tungsten. You don't buy gold to make a few percentage of profit, you buy it for if the world ends. If you're ever in that situation, you can chop the damned thing in half.
The cost of doing such a thing generally doesn't make sense unless youre working with amounts most of the people on this sub will never touch, so your $200 french chicken isn't going to have a tungsten core, it isn't worth it. If you're dealing with kilos, your counterparty can afford to deal with kilos. If not, the cost of doing a proper fake outweighs the reward. 
I can detect a shitty fake 18k wedding ring at the antique swap meet with my eyes. Gold and btc are for different purposes, but for the amount most people will be dealing with, making a good fake will never be worth it unless gold or silver moons, which seems increasingly unlikely since I was into them years ago.

And the fine folks at PayPal haven't become better people this entire time.

Bitcoin is competition for PayPal. Why wouldn't they want to screw over the competition?

We could do an otc trade using an escrow service like localbitcoins or hodlhodl. I was recently in Brazil figuring out exactly how to do that. Pm me.

Paypal will automatically decide against you in the dispute when they hear the word bitcoin, and then yes, they will send you to collections. They also have a rather nasty habit of helping themselves to any money they feel you owe them by taking it out of any bank account or credit card you have EVER had connected to your paypal account.

Your friend could run afoul of  AML regulations. Don't do this in the USA.

1. Never trust paypal. Ever. For anything. 
2. If someone hits you up and immediately wants to do a large transaction, be suspicious. Normal people do a small transaction with a new trade partner first to make sure the communication is good, or, at the very least, are quite reasonable about the idea if you suggest it. 
3. A ton of people these days will try to convince you to use some escrow service that they know of that is better or cheaper that whatever you suggest. Your bitcoin will, of course, go into the escrow service and never come out. Tell them to go to hell.

Sign up for a couple of different exchanges. Cash out on each of them every day. Mitigate your risk, exchange cash-out problems always seem to happen during a bull run.

Don't sell all at once. If a mysterious problem pops up, it's better to have the exchange playing games with you over a small amount of money than a big amount of money.

And by doing so, create even more tax headaches!
