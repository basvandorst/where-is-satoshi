No controversial? That's where the best posts are!

Welcome to the fascinating world of cryptocurrencies! Yes bitcoin is in part similar to a stock, in that its value fluctuates relative to other currencies.
Buying low and selling high will result in profit, but keep these things in mind:
* Only invest what you wouldn't mind losing.
* Timing the market is difficult if not impossible.
* Beware of irrational exuberance. Be wise not emotional.
As to your last question, is that the goal? For some people, short term profit is certainly their goal. But others, including myself, see bitcoin as a way to give people true control over their money.
The best quality of bitcoin is not that the price will rise in the short or long term, which it may due to its deflationary nature and other benefits, but the fact that if you keep your private key safe, no bank, government or criminal can take your coins.
Enjoy and best of luck to you!

Honestly I think it's rediculous that bitcoin is not considered as a simple currency. Capitol gains to buy a beer, yea that makes sense.

Glad to see more adoption. I've been using my shift card [ to use bitcoin wherever visa is accepted for a few years now.

Hello. I bought a hard drive off of Newegg last week for bitcoin. I'm not sure about anything illegal. I'd say it's perfectly ethical to invest in, more crime is committed with USD. I expect bitcoin to replace gold and other stores of value and then eventually take over the world. Happy trading!

Good morning! How are you today?

I do expect bitcoin's value to be really high one day. I remember when they were $2 each, so they're already pretty high compared to that. I spend it because I believe in it being used as a currency. It may not be easier than spending fiat money now, but it has other benefits such as no chargebacks. And for people living in oppressive states or failed economies, bitcoin may be far easier to use than fiat.

Wouldn't that show up in a spike in the network hash rate? And as a noticeable presence in the total mined by pool charts? They would have to mine every block for 10 weeks to get 500k new coins.

How did you guess my bitcoin password!?!

OK. You're our ~~as~~ organizer. :)

For realz. I demand my bitcoin back. (Not to mention the site totally being hugged to death.)

Mango. Not even once.

I wonder what will happen when people can't buy bitcoins on MtGox for any price?

Anyone feel like recording their own version, acoustically, or any other way, so that it would fall under fair use? This song seems too important to censor.

Thanks! Cleared up two misconceptions I had:
 [Elliptic curve cryptography is vulnerable to quantum computing]( and that public addresses were actually hashes of the ~~private~~ public key (Thanks oskArtist) in order to further protect the key pair.  
Have any links as to the susceptibility of hashing algorithms to quantum computers?

Supply cannot increase. More powerful miners just result in a higher difficulty. The rate of generation remains the same.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:45:52
I guess that depends on if you want $10000 now, or can wait a short while to sell it for even more. That damn MtGox verification queue is going to be trouble.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:16:08
Thanks. That's what I meant. I should probably try to never make that mistake again.

I've heard you can ask a friendly mining pool to include your transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-10 10:06:57
Pretty much. I need to research a few merchant account providers, but I feel confident explaining the underlying technology.

Your agreement level looks to be a bubble ;)
