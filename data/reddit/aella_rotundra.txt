a mortgage is cheaper from bank a than bank b, doesn't mean I should buy a house...

Good Luck...but seriously....I'd wait a few days before hoping on the bandwagon...

Note: the preliminary specifications are currently reported by our design tools. They have not yet been proven in a laboratory and might be subject to change, although we do not expect it to vary much.
And only 100% upfront, then you can wait 4 months to maybe get something a bit like it....
They may be legitimate...doesn't mean it is a good deal...

We should plot it on a log scale...it will look linear.... :P

I can give you the top 5 they shouldn't:
1. For larger transactions it's impractical - to be secure they should be waiting + 1 hour, for a smaller business 10 minutes is probably ok...but 10 minutes is a lot of time to dedicate to a customer.
2. Market instability - Do I list those widgets for 0.3 bitcoin or 0.35 bitcoin...depends on the day, time, whether china has done anything for a few days.
3. Liquidity - Like all payment methods, the current systems are a pain in the ass to actually liquidate the assets. You have to really believe in the system to want to set yourself up with Yet Another Payment Provider (YAPP)
4. Customers - Bitcoin attracts a certain kind of person, you may or may not want your brand to be associated with those kinds of people...
5. Unproven - If I do spend all the effort going through this and bitcoin flops, or another thing takes its place, i'm left with nothing useful.
Now some helpful things: 
1. Lots of opportunities here for risk management providers and lots of new technologies could make this go away.
2. See 1.
3. There are lots of providers here already who make this easy, and will probably be essential in the phase over from cash and cards to bitcoin. 
4. These people generally have spare income, are willing to spend money on frivolities and will reward merchants who cater to them.
5. A combination of 1,3 and 5 can make for some very nice short term rewards, and the more of them there are, the more likely long term bets will pay off.

Whatever advice I give you will be biased by my own interests and world views. You should decide for yourself.
If this is to play around and investigate, sure go ahead and buy...I don't see BC dropping anywhere out of the price range it is fluctuating in at the moment for a few weeks at least (that is to say, I don't think it will drop below 250 anytime soon)
If you are looking to dump any serious money or money that you want to use soon to buy things, then I would hold off a few weeks (or buy a small portion now with a plan to buy more later to offset some of the risk)
At the end of the day it is up to you.

There was an even playing field when bitcoin started...stop feeling hurt.

Bitcoin won't be mainstream for a while yet (if ever...) there are still many many client issues to sort out.
1. Downloading and verifying the entire blockchain to start with - this is currently taking what? A couple of days on a standard laptop? Sure there are gateway providers but most of bitcoin's marketing is "Trustless, decentralised currency" and "Be secure, don't store your bitcoin online, download to a local or offline wallet" until they can differentiate themselves, and make it easy for anyone to set up a client I foresee a lack of major uptake.
2. While we're on the topic - Security - Managing every aspect of bitcoin at the moment is a security nightmare  - if the coffee shops, bars who are accepting bitcoin were actually following the guidelines around how long you should wait for a confirmation (the theoretical minimum is 1 hour...) then there would be very very long lines.  This is one of the major hazards I see for bitcoin going forward - there is no nice realtimeness - unless you back it with some other currency (or a centralised trusted third party...in which case...why use bitcoin??)
3. I'm not convinced by the arguments I have heard about bitcoins future (think 5-10 years out) when the buzz dies down and it is mainstream, the price of a single bitcoin I imagine will be quite high - in which case it needs to be broken down to be usable -the problem then is, at the moment it requires manual developer intervention to allow the use of smaller and smaller bits - If bitcoin is that successful will the developers (who are presumably quite well off in bitcoin terms) care? Will they pass it on? How is the legacy of the software going to be managed? How exactly does this make the system "decentalized"?
There are more, but I don't like rambling. I am still cheering bitcoin though - I feel it has enough inertia to go the whole way, but requires much more tweaking.

The systems in place would be such that no one employee would have the power to cause such disruption...in general the keys to such decisions would be cryptographically split between a group, and it would require more than a certain percentage of the group to be present and sign off on such a change.

All regulatory  banks will have entire divisions dedicated to corporate security. The includes mitigating against risks caused by fire, theft, storms, earthquakes, tidalwaves, espionage, volcanos, terrorism, military invasion, massive disk loss, massive data centre loss and gigantic money stealing clowns.
They will have at least 3 fold redundancy, and at least 3-fold backups on these redundancies.

Assuming you are concerned about malware, if the drive is physically connected to the machine and accessible from the host operating system then any malware that gets on you internet machine can access that partition.
It's an extra step - but not an insurmountable one (and probably a common usecase for bitcoin stealing malware...)

I would consider them lost.

I can kind of agree with you on 1 and 2 - for 1 good marketing would supplant whatever preconceived ideas people have (that doesn't mean I don't think it's a shame that partaking in the network has such a long ramp up time)
For 2, yeah, the theoretical attack scenarios are rare, but I could certainly see a headline in the mid range future reading "Starbucks lose thousands in dedicated bitcoin attack"  - the financial awards for mounting such an attack are directly small, but if someone were to pull of such an an attack (it would take a lot, but not unattainable amount of luck as well), it would be quite a PR blow.
On point 3, it is definitely an issue. Humans are fallible. One of bitcoins huge selling points is that I don't need to trust people, the protocol takes care of that. Leaving important decisions in the hands of people who are not motivated to make the correct ones (or could be motivated to make the incorrect ones) is a major concern. (this is also one of the factors which makes 2 more likely  - when groups start controlling large fractions of the mining fleet, maths is on their side, and pulling of small frauds becomes a matter of persuasion and timing)
