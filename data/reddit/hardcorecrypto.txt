Since i'm using p2p marketplaces, I would like it to be stable at first...

Crypto Beach is a nice name lol

Use Paxful instead 
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:59:30
Paxful only needs KYC if you reach a certain volume dude

People actually Buy and sell Bitcoins even if there's a dip, look at Peer-to-peer Marketplaces, they actually buy because they use it for their own Business, I really hope people would learn more about them and how Bitcoin Works
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:54:14
I guess it’s because western people don’t really use bitcoins when there’s a dip... and Africans don’t really care about the dip! We should really follow what they’re doing instead of using exchanges
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:59:05
Rules would only benefit these exchanges! Power to the people!
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:21:47
It's basically the same thing why politicians don't fund schools that well... they're afraid of educated voters... People would have to realise that P2p finance is much better to use than exchanges! 
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:37:08
 It's already happening, Somebody already built a school using Bitcoins in Africa, some of the people who can't get a bank account is already using it. This is why I think it will change the world, It's already happening... People helping other people is really amazing....
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:23:20
Just use Paxful

People wish Hodling works this way! trading actually makes more sense 
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:26:22
it's just that there are no sellers on Bisq. Makes me think they scam people, also, why the fuck should I install it on my PC? Localbitcoins and Paxful work on desktops and mobile fine + they have both Buyers and sellers on my Location

P2P platforms will thrive at this Bear market, this is because P2P traders NEED FIAT, and third world countries use Bitcoins as a payment system (What it should really be)
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:00:58
A good investment is learning how Cryptocurrency works, not really just buying and selling

Is it a crime to support peer-to-peer?

I agree, However, in my situation, I'm buying Bitcoins anonymously, (I was 17 when I first bought my Bitcoins) Age was something to look at... Can't buy anything. Luckily I found a way to buy BTC using Gift cards.. and I did use that, now, set up my own business for trading and It's now working fine :D
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:38:22
Asking those in 3rd world countries how they use Bitcoin is also different from asking those  people who use it in the 1st world country
@_date: 2018-12-19 10:18:51
It would also be a good thing if they use it to make their own business, people from third world countries has been doing it because they don't get affected by volatility that much, we should use it as a currency, and we should buy goods with it. not just HODL it
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:40:24
The way I see it is that Venezuelans Mine Bitcoins, Now they use p2p Marketplaces like Localbitcoins and Paxful to sell their BTC for bank transfers, that's why p2p marketplaces have the upper hand in here, it's because they won't really care about the dip.

Tried to investigate a bit and I saw that the winnings will be sent to their respective paxful wallet, here's the breakdown: 
 **Top trader/1st place - $250 USD credit in Paxful wallet**   
**2nd place - $150 USD credit in Paxful wallet**   
**3rd place - $100 USD credit in Paxful wallet**   
**4th place - $75 USD credit in Paxful wallet**   
**5th place - $50 USD credit in Paxful wallet**   
**6th to 100th place - $2 USD credit in Paxful wallet**   
**101st to 286th place - $1 USD credit in Paxful wallet** 
[  
250usd isn't so bad right now...

This is why 3rd world countries are ahead of 1st world countries when it comes to bitcoins, it’s because they actually utilize bitcoins and use it for buying/selling goods. Those who use it in exchanges are now turning to peer-to-peer

People really need to know how to create a business with Bitcoin \*flies away
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:54:05
You guys are looking at it on a wrong perspective, tbh, 1st world countries makes it look like it's dead because of the price, meanwhile 3rd world countries makes a lot more using peer-to-peer Exchanges. Crypto should be for EVERYONE.

I watch this channel on Youtube called WeTheCryptos, seems good for a Bitcoin Beginner: [
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:19:41
Wow! This is a nice and inspiring story! Hope you're also using p2p platforms and use it for business 
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:50:06
Why are people so amused with the increase of Worldwide ATMs even though Bitcoin is crashing? p2p platforms also doubled up their data, the main reason for this is because 3rd world countries can get them, and if they can get them it only means that mass adaptation has already begun.  
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:09:42
It might be better to take a look at a more secure p2p platform, If it's sketchy try to research first, using escrow is safer...
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:06:10
No doubt that P2p will win this dip, try using a different P2P platform too, they might work out fine,
