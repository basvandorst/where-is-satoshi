If you think that the much celebrated 'greatest financial revolution' of our time and the 'biggest bubble ever' is going to crash down to zero after a puny 320 billion in market cap then you didn't do enough research on it. I'll worry about bitcoin going burst when it's market cap is over 6 trillion USD and that too without it being used in daily lives and accepted by all the major Govts. 
Bitcoin core dev team needs to do whatever need be to improve Txn speeds and reduce Txn fees. Else, it will lose dominance and be taken over by some better coin.

Laszlo was an early miner. Also, afaik, it wasn't just once that he bought pizzas for 10k BTC. The pizzas costed 24ish usd and for that he paid 10k btc which was worth 41 usd that day. He knew he was getting a raw deal but he still did it to promote BTC use. Also, afaik, he's still in possessions of thousands of BTC and is still a whale

It'll stabilize after mass adoption really occurs.

True for a speculative bubble. Am wondering when the wall street collapses. It's overbought as f* I am gonna take all my stock trader friends and relatives to dinner in the most expensive restaurant of my country that day.

It's always the fiat that gets paid to creditors after every bankruptcy. Not assets

True. I was thinking, is there a way for me to figure out origin of BTC I own? As in what block were they generated and who was the miner? There should be history attached to every BTC one owns. But your concerns are true as well.

Are you saying that once the liabilities have been paid off in fiat, the BTC that's still held by Gox will still be liquidated just to pay the creditors a bonus? I don't think it works that way. I think rest of the BTC will go to Mark Karpeles. But I am no lawyer, I'd wanna know more about it.

Maybe. Laws change from country to country. Maybe Japanese laws need the company to be liquidated to fiat

Hey guys, totally different topic but I need your advise. If a scammer sends stolen eth from his mew to another and finally to Binance, anyway to get him caught?

It's not about hiding money. It's about our right to do whatever the fuck we want with our own money as long as it isn't criminal

Still, it ain't like your central bank banned banking system from serving crypto related businesses

I for one don't talk about bitcoin with anyone in real life. Will tell them once certain goals are achieved.
