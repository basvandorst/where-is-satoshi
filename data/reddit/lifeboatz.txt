No.  If you deposit a substantial sum of money in the bank, the bank files a suspicious activity report, and locks the funds.
I had this happen to me.  I moved money from my brokerage account to my US Bank account (less than $100K, but not by much), in preparation to pay off some debt.  The money was immediately frozen, I received a letter in the mail several days later, and I couldn't do anything with it.
After the money being tied up for a while (more than two weeks, less than two months), I was able to transfer the money to pay off the debts.

I would look at it more like "some money is gone, and we aren't willing yet to tell you how much", but not necessarily a confirmation of insolvency or confirmation of the strategy document.
Money could be missing for lots of reasons (like government confiscation, theft, losing the keys).  They may know exactly who took the money, and may be working with law enforcement right now.  If it was taken by a customer, they may know the exact identity of the person or people.
And maybe they are being advised not to say a thing, until the authorities can nab the suspect, with the hopes of grabbing the money too.  Or maybe they are being advised by their lawyers not to say a thing.

You are comparing hoarding to circulating.  Sure, circulating would be better than hoarding.
But permanent hoarding compared to not participating at all, makes no difference.  It's just changing the numerator and the denominator, resulting in the same participation.
What is the difference between 21 M coins being available, and half that many being available with the rest destroyed?  Aside from the 8th decimal place, nothing at all.

Basically, if I understand the video, you have created an app store that people can install onto their phones/devices, on iOS or Android, that allows them to buy other apps one time, using Bitcoin, that, once you buy it, you can run the app on any device (iOS or Android).
And then app writers need to rewrite their apps so that they are multi-platform.  The advantage to the app developer is that they write it once for multiple platforms, and don't need to pay the apple app surcharge.
The advantage to users is that you buy an app once and it runs on multiple technologies.
Do I have that right?

They will use some bitcoin that Winklevosses acquired for this purpose.  And once it's fully subscribed (so that the amount of investment dollars matches the value of the bitcoins they put in), then on a daily basis, they will manage the purchases and sales such that on a daily basis, they buy new bitcoins that match the inflows minus the outflows of the ETF (sometimes meaning that they sell).   And yes, it's a 5 shares to 1 BTC ratio.

I'm inclined to agree with the OP, that the average person on the street (in the US) is brainwashed into thinking that WikiLeaks is bad.  Fox News doesn't help, nor does SNL (the popular comedy show).  Nor does the newspaper, nor does Obama or Congress (both parties) who want to vigorously prosecute whistle-blowers.
In tech circles, they tend to get it.  But the propaganda from media and our leaders in the US definitely has most "average" people either not knowing much about WikiLeaks (and Snowden for that matter), or they think "oh yeah, that's the sketchy criminal organization that steals secret documents and exposes them, jeopardizing our nation's security."

No, if I send you money to your Bitcoin Address, I am not using your public key.  I am using your bitcoin address.  
I have no way of knowing your public key unless you tell me, or unless you later spend the money.  Given just the bitcoin address, it is computationally infeasible to calculate the public key.
The bitcoin address is a hash of the public key.  It's much shorter, and then it contains a checksum.

I think the biggest hurdle in creating US-based bitcoin businesses is the State-by-State maze of licensing and regulations.

I can't speak for OP, but the proper way for a business to file their taxes is to determine their net, and be taxed on it.  Net is calculated by deducting qualified expenses.   Electricity and depreciation are certainly valid business expenses in a mining business.  And Bitcoin fluctuations would be as well, if handled properly (i.e. you get taxed on the coin when you mine it.  That gives you a basis.  If you sell for less than the basis, that's a capital loss.)
So, it's possible that there's nothing shady about this.  There's no "taxpayers on the hook".
@_date: 2014-08-01 09:05:10
yup.  same with dollars.  When Overstock was accepting dollars via coinbase, they didn't keep the vast majority of dollars.  They spent them on their supply chain, on merchandise, on servers, on labor.

Here's the logic of splitting and merging:  If you are running a service that allows people to send coins out of your service, and you want to be high-speed, you want to have enough funded addresses available to handle any withdrawals that might happen at a given time.  That way you don't have to wait for confirmations of one payout before making the next payout.  So it's a logical function to split large amounts into many smaller addresses.
These addresses, when used for spending, will often create change that is very small.  So after your payouts, you can end up with a lot of small balances in various addresses, which generally are a pain to deal with.  So, you can combine them when making a payout, or you can combine them in advance of making a payout.  That's the logic of the merging.

I think volatility diminishes with use.  Example:  If I know my costs are denominated in Bitcoins, and I can predict them, then I can offer my goods or services denominated in a fixed price of Bitcoins.  Right now, Bitcoin is a "point-in-time" solution.  Even Bitpay won't let you hold something's price for longer than 15 minutes.  But once I can count on a price being reasonably stable for a longer period (which can be guaranteed with hedges), I can offer my goods or services for a price denominated in Bitcoins for a longer period of time.
My belief is that the issue of volatility is self-correcting, but it will take substantial time.  Bitcoin still needs to climb a big curve of usage, which is really part of the "price discovery phase", before this will naturally be resolved.
If (big if) Bitcoin continues on its acceptance curve, then for a while, there will be more new users each year.  Year X+1 will add on more new users than year X did.  And maybe Year X+2 will add on more new users than Year X+1 did.  And during that period of rising interest, the exchange rate will likely tend upward, until a year when that is no longer true, and we begin to approach market saturation.  
I would expect some volatility at that point (when people realize that there is no giant pool of new users that can still join), and then the price will pull back and bounce around a stable point.  
If we just hit that point this year, and this is as big as it's going to get, then this is the bounce that you have seen between October and now.  But I doubt it.  I think there are at least two more of those run-ups as more and more people discover Bitcoin (and as it becomes easier to buy and use).

It's the author's prerogative to offer any license or licenses that they choose.  I am not disagreeing that it CAN BE political (but it need not be).
For maximum freedom, the author would say "pick any license you want".  That way, if someone wants to build upon it, and incorporate changes under a GPL license (requiring others to license the fork as GPL if they change it), or BSD or MIT or whatever they want.
There is nothing wrong with dual-licensing it.  It's not "Licensing it under a BSD license **on top of** the GPL" as you said, like a layered license.  It's **in addition to**.  It's a CHOICE of license, to be chosen by the user.

Either bitcoin will last forever, or it will someday be replaced by something better.  I can't think of an invention older than 30 years that wasn't eventually replaced by something better.  Even fundamental things like the wheel or the printing press were displaced (by flight and electronic printing).
 
So the logical conclusion is that someday, Bitcoin will be replaced.  It might be 5000 years from now.  It might be 200 years from now.  But you would have a difficult time proving to me that it will last forever.
With that as a given, the value of Bitcoin will eventually be less than its peak.  You don't know which peak, but at some point, there will be a final peak.
And you don't know if this past peak was the last peak.  The price is lower than the last bubble.  You have no evidence that it hasn't peaked - just charts of past performance.  But we've already shown that past performance is unlikely to last forever.
So, given that at some point it will peak, and then be below its peak from then on, your argument that it's always going to be higher than the last bubble doesn't hold up.

Well, Coinbase is buying from an exchange.  Coinbase isn't facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. They are simply acting as a retail shop for you to buy or sell.
At an exchange, you would be able to place limit orders, keep fiat on hand, do day-trading, and hop in and out of Bitcoin very rapidly.  You just can't do that with CoinBase now, because every time you buy or sell, it goes to your bank account (adding days into the process).

I didn't miss the point at all.  You just chose the absolute wrong aspect of a business to highlight, since it doesn't apply to Chipotle who isn't paying dividends.
Chipotle is an asset too.  It happens to be a collection of assets.  It can be bought and sold as a piece of the whole (the stock of the company), and the assets individually (stores, inventory, desks, etc.) can be bought and sold as well.
Chipotle as a whole is considered to be worth much more than its parts (sometimes calculated to be "book value" or "asset value") because of the expectation of generating income.
Bitcoin has a different value proposition - not to generate income, but to allow storage and transfer of value.  You can store value like Chipotle does too, by buying stores or inventory.  But there's no expectation of Bitcoin generating income (by anyone who has thought it through).
You just highlighted the wrong thing.

A key fact that I haven't seen mentioned in this discussion is this:
For several years, people have been arguing to increase the maximum block size, as a solution to scaling up to many more transactions.  and others wisely resisted this, as it is trying to solve the wrong problem.  We are currently limited on the number of transactions because there's an **incentive** problem.  
An analogy is an underutilized road whose toll is very expensive.  "If we add lanes, we'll increase the number of cars on it."   ...no, change the incentive to get more cars on there.
So he is hitting the incentive problem and the scale problem with the same hammer, and **not** needing to increase the maximum block size.

Well, here are 30 users who have a lot to lose:  [Top BTC holders]( [Top USD holders]( [Top Euro holders](
These people will get 10 cents on the dollar in a full liquidation.  With 30 phone calls, Karpeles can explain how they can get 100% or 120% of their money.  That's a ton.  
"In exchange for you waiving all claims of this money, you will get free trades, and your share of 100% of the profits will go to you, until you are made whole times 120%.  Either take this offer, or take your chances with liquidation."
Once the big guys are back in, and trading has resumed, you'll be amazed at how forgiving people are.   With the first 20 phone calls, they could shore up their balance sheet from 18% reserves to around 50% reserves.  Call this group "A" payout people.
Then you go to the masses and say "Look, in liquidation, you'll get about 10 cents on the dollar.  We want to be 100% reserve - no fractional reserve, and be able to prove it.  
We have already taken our reserve from 18% to 50% as part of this restructuring..  You can benefit from this, and help us get back on our feet.  Or you can get ten cents on the dollar in liquidation.  Your choice.
The countdown starts today. If you sign up today, and waive 60% of your claim on the reserve, you'll get made whole in group "B", up to 120% of your original funds on deposit.  But don't wait to sign up.  As more people sign up, less benefit will be derived.  The last people to sign up will only get 105% of their original funds, and be last on the recovery list.  Sign ups start at midnight GMT."
Then watch as people sign up to try to recover their funds, waiving their claims.  If no one signs up, they all lose.  If you sign up, you increase your potential payout from 18% (liquidation) to 40% immediately upon full reserve, with a chance of getting 120%.   I think people would jump on that.
And the more people jump on it, the more solid Gox is.  And these people also have money in Gox with the incentive of seeing it be successful.
You'll be amazed.

I'm saying that you may have an opportunity of a lifetime... you're sitting in an ideal spot in history for innovation (a budding industry, a lot of investment capital coming this way, etc).
Don't let anyone tell you that you are too young to figure it out.  But don't let this opportunity slip by.  Six years from now, you can still do a start-up, but it's a wide-open playing field right now, so you may want to get something going *now*.

Well, I agree that if it seriously affects the course of economic history, then it may be prize-worthy.  If it's "just" another successful payment system, then maybe not so much.  
My question is, what measurement do you use to determine that, yes, this is prize-worthy.

"Proudest moment: more valuable than gold" makes no sense.
You mean one arbitrary unit of Bitcoin is more valuable than one arbitrary unit of Gold?  That happened years before, if you let me choose the arbitrary unit.
You mean all bitcoins are worth more than all gold?  Not even close.

Wouldn't it be possible though to have system parameters determined by market consensus based on the mined blocks, much like the proposals for transaction fees?
Each time a block is mined, a set of bitcoin parameters could be included in the header that is the miner's opinion of the appropriate settings concerning fees, max block size, min transactions required per block (!?), and any other system/network parameters.   Then every 2 weeks, compute the mean values.
I believe this technique has been used in the past to vote on protocol changes (i.e. when x% of the blocks mined contain X, then we'll start a clock to switch to the new PTSH (or whatever).   Same sort of voting method could be used.

I agree that there needs to be adequate testing.  But that's not the complaint.
Here's reality:  It would be helpful for every transaction to have a unique, unchangeable reference number.  Mt. Gox requested this.  The devs created one - a simple hash on the immutable data of the transaction, and said "Mt. Gox, will this meet your needs?"
Mt. Gox didn't reply for more than TWO DAYS.  Not "let us take a look."  Not "let us run some tests to be very thorough since this is financial software, like recommends."  They gave ZERO response for more than 48 hours.  Then another day went by with no substantive reply.  Again, not "we're working on it."
If my entire business was basically shut down, and customers were furious, I would sure as hell be working on the solution *provided by the very devs that I slammed and made the request of*.  It's really inexcusable.

PS it costs nothing to play with bitcoinpaperwallet, and generate a few trial runs.  One important step, you may want to generate the paper wallet "offline".  That is, load the web page, and then unplug from the internet and turn off your wireless router, generate the printed paper wallet, and then reboot before reconnecting.

Bitcoins can be produced as part of securing the network and tracking the ledger.  They probably cost ~$600 to produce, secure, and track the ledger right now.  Eventually there won't be any cost of production though.

Source please.  Because I think your facts are wrong.
The facts are that he was charged in a New York jurisdiction, and the murder-for-hire was never part of the charges in New York, but were mentioned in the explanation of other charges.
Then he was charged a second time in a Maryland Federal District, for murder for hire.
Then the New York case moved forward in which he was not (and never) charged with murder for hire, and Ross' Mom said it was significant that murder-for-hire wasn't one of the charges (but it isn't significant, because it *never was* one of the charges in New York).
To the best of my knowledge, the [second charges in Maryland for murder for hire]( still loom over him, in a second case.  
I would be very interested to hear that those second charges were dropped, if you have proof.

You could convey the "tab limit" to the bartender, and then receive the change when you close out the bill.
Example:  Let's say you want to open a tab for a maximum of .15 BTC.  You send .15 BTC, and then drink away.   When you get the bill, of say .09324 BTC, you calculate a tip, and tell the bartender that you want to pay .111888 BTC.  Since you already paid .15BTC, you get .038112 back.  The bartender would return that to you (like he returns your credit card) by paying the address of your choice.
There are no systems that I am aware of right now that automate this.
(FYI, the dollar values of the above example (at $666/BTC) are a limit of about a hundred bucks, buying about $62 worth of drinks, paying a 20% tip, and getting about $25 back.)

Protip:  You can re-submit links on Reddit, if you change them slightly.   Easiest way to do this is to add a query string (if there is none), or append to the query string (if there is one).
In this case, there is a query string (you can tell by the question mark in the URL).
To append to the query string, append something at the end, starting with an ampersand, like "&amp;x".
To add a new query string where there is none, append something to the end starting with a question mark, like "?x".
Sometimes I'll add something like "&amp;had_to_add_this_to_resubmit_to_reddit".

Well, the only way to estimate hash rate is to look at solved blocks.  You basically examine the recently solved blocks and see how long they took, and what difficulty they were trying to solve.
And of course, you have to take variance into account, so one block being slow to solve really doesn't mean much.  It might indicate a problem, but it might also indicate bad luck.   So you need to look across multiple blocks.  So the last 6 blocks or the last 100 blocks will give a better indication than one block.  
And that chart is only going to be an estimate of what you can see by looking at the blocks being solved.
Interestingly, if the block hasn't been solved after 35 minutes (like the case now), it's still an estimated ten minutes away from being solved.

Agreed.  Although claimed it's ["supposed to be a currency"]( I'm not sure of the basis for that.
I don't believe that Satoshi claimed initially that it was "supposed to be a currency".  He doesn't even use the term "currency" in the white paper.  Just that it's a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.   So I'm not sure who declared that it's "supposed" to be a currency!  Certainly not me.

I believe the early copies of bitcoin-qt simply held the 256 bits in a binary pattern.  When represented in Base-58, they all have the same prefix, but I don't think that's how they were stored.
Good to know he has the bitcoin address.  That would definitely save some time.
One can also try to see which parts of the disk do not contain active data, and simply look there.  Or look for the (deleted) directory entry for wallet.dat, and then go straight to the file.  This method would be the first thing I would try (and there's software that can do that for you).
The first method requires that the wallet.dat file not be encrypted, naturally, while other methods (locating the file), require that you know the encryption password.

The quantity of bitcoins that are issued approaches 21 Million asymptotically.  50 bitcoins were issued approximately every ten minutes until half of the 21 million were issued, which was reached in late November 2012.  Then the software automatically cut the issue rate in half, to 25 bitcoins approximately every ten minutes.  When half of the remaining coins (i.e. 75% of the total) have been issued, the issue rate cuts in half again, to 12.5 bitcoins approximately every 10 minutes.  This is all programmed into the system in a way that is very unlikely (and near impossible) to change.
That means we'll approach, but never reach, 21 Million, because every time you get half way there, you cut the rate in half.  And practically speaking, the number of bitcoins being issued every ten minutes become so small that it's less than the precision of the system.  (i.e. less than 0.00000001 bitcoins every ten minutes).  This will be the case in the ~2140 timeframe (although right now, we're ahead of schedule).
After that point, no new bitcoins will be generated.  Or, if they are, it's probably because the future developers extended the precision of the system to more decimal places - a precision change would probably be accepted by the majority, but changing the upper limit probably would not.
After that point, the system still runs just fine, with no new bitcoins being generated.  The existing bitcoins are circulated, much like a fixed amount of gold coins might be circulated.  And miners are rewarded by transaction fees.

added the risk of storage of bitcoin without adding the risk of storage of credit cards.

My first answer is consistent with other answers you have received.  There are several issues with adjustments every block.  One is that a single block solve-time isn't a good measure (due to variance), so you'd have to average it over a number of blocks anyway.  Another issue is orphaned blocks, and how that is handled.
But you bring up a good point.  Adjusting every block, using statistics from a past window of blocks that have been confirmed multiple times - like the blocks from 10 ago to 2016 ago - would have benefits.  It would smooth out the curve, so that there aren't giant jumps in the difficulty.  It could adjust faster (i.e. be safer) in the event that half the miners got knocked off the network (or some other catastrophic event).
Definitely worth discussion beyond simply dismissing it outright as others have.

I haven't seen any research, but I have seen comments on forum threads.  They mostly just start with some assumptions and wild guesses.  
These aren't my numbers, but the math goes something like this:  Suppose 210 Million people want to hold $100 worth of pocket change.  That calculation alone means that there MUST be at least $21 Billion worth of Bitcoins serving that purpose.  And that means if there are only 21 Million bitcoins available, each one has to be worth $1000 simply to support that use.
I don't know how many small businesses there are in the world, but I know my small business of under ten people requires a monthly float of about $50K, just to handle the various timings of bills - payroll, rent, utilities, etc.  Say there's seven million small businesses in the world (?!), and each needs $3K worth of Bitcoins for their monthly cycle.  That's $21B more in "market cap" that's needed for that function, so that means that another $1000 / bitcoin value would be required, just to be able to meet that need.
Then look at savers.  Maybe there will ultimately be 21 Million people who want to store an average of $5000 of their savings in Bitcoin.  This adds another $5000 to the potential price.
Of course these are all made up numbers, but that's the sort of math that doesn't seem too out of whack, if you assume another decade of success and growth for Bitcoin.  But who the heck knows what will happen.

But the overall value of the system, in general, can be expected to increase with an increase in security of the coins, due to increased hash power.

I attend Bitcoin Meetups, with women, and have never seen women treated that way, nor heard such complaints.  
She says this is what it is like to be a woman at a Bitcoin Meetup, which is absolutely false.  This is what one person on one night, at one meetup experienced.  
She goes on to say "this is a larger trend".  She has one datapoint and somehow tries to generalize it to be a large trend that all Bitcoin meetups are creepy for women, or that it's on the rise?
She's insulting **me**, as a guy who politely attends meetups and who would never intentionally or unintentionally insult women at the meetups like that.  Please, Arianna, don't lump me in with the creeps, or discourage other women from attending Bitcoin Meetups throughout the world just because *one* meetup in *one* city on *one* night was offensive to *one* person thanks to a couple of individuals.
Just as these creeps need to be called out, she needs to hear it as well.  I'm thick skinned, so I'm over it.  But that's how I felt reading this blog post.  ....just sayin'....

Yeah, it's hard to debate that logic.
The only (failed) counter-argument I can think of, would go something like this:
You are allowed to defend yourself or seek retribution for crimes committed against you.  And article 2 states that you are able to delegate those powers to an agent if you wish.  
So if Smith is an agent of the State, and the State is truly an agent of the people, then *certain* actions by Jones against the people could be justified, since they are no longer "innocent" people - they harmed him through their agent's, the State and Smith.
Of course, this argument breaks down if the State isn't a true agent of the people, or if the people are children, etc.  And, those *certain* actions that would be OK probably wouldn't include spraying machine gun fire randomly.

This is really good, but it may also help to tell the one differentiation.
Unlike your login and password, with a private key you don't need to reveal it to use it.  It's like having a password generating machine (RSA key or yubikey) that generates "proof" anytime you need to use it.  It's the machine that you are proving you have, by supplying the login and password.
I always laugh when people ask me for that CCV/CVC number on the back of my credit card, as "proof" that I have the card.  I give them the number and now they can "prove" (falsely) that they have the card.  logins and passwords are like that too.   Private keys are not.

I read "50" somewhere a long time ago, and I can't find the reference.  If you are good at counting the 100 from the pool, you can wait until 100.   Mostly, though, it's playing it safe. 
A transaction can use 2 from the pool, but it's not typical.  For instance, if you have money in your wallet, and you send a fraction of it to yourself, you will consume two, one for the new address and one for the change.
But most transactions will only consume one new address.

I was responding to the claim that it was not a well known issue, that it was documented more than 13 months ago.
But, speaking of specious arguments, you are comparing Wikipedia's technical contact, where there are more than 21 Million discussion pages to the Bitcoin Wiki, where there are less than 1400 pages, and this one is linked to via a page discussing transaction security, and comparing the technical contact of Wikipedia, which doesn't hold people's money to the CEO of Mt. Gox whose sole function is to process financial transactions.  Yes, specious indeed.
His resources should know the ins and out of Bitcoin, if anyone does!
It seems to me that there would be a giant red flag when the site was leaking funds.  He should know precisely how much bitcoin and fiat his site THINKS he has, and should be able to look at financial statements and the blockchain to see how much he really has.  I suspect he was making so much money that he thought he could fly fast and loose.  But it's other people's money.

They're going through an orderly bankruptcy.  This involves asking all creditors to step forward and file claims.  Then once the claims have been verified, dividing up the money to the claimants (less legal fees).
Some people won't file claims either because they don't want to be identified, they are lazy, uninformed, or dead.  Others can benefit from that, by getting more than their fair share, simply by filing.
You can read about it on the website.  I also received a post card from Gox, giving me the details, but I had less than a penny on Gox, so I won't be filing.

Consider for a moment a closed-source start-up technology company, with some really good technical people.  There are probably frequent architectural arguments, and each person may take a different side, and be passionate about their position.  In the end, a technology decision is made, and the project moves forward.  And sometimes the person who "lost" the technical discussion will be bitter.
Th difference with Bitcoin is that it plays out in an open forum.   There are some very opinionated people, each with different agendas.  And there are some very tough problems ahead, that need to get solved, with no clear winning answers.
The winner may not be the best technical solution.  The winning solution may be the first reasonable solution that gets implemented without pissing too many people off.  And that means that developers need to present their solutions in a politically savvy way, to get their ideas implemented.
Amir and Peter Todd tend to present their ideas in a "sky is falling", political extremist fashion:   Amir is more of the anti-government slant, while Peter appears to be "cooperation with government is bad, reliance on trust is bad, centralization is bad".  I think of them both as extremely valuable forces in the community.
Mike Hearn's contribution was huge in bitcoinj.  This pre-dated the term "bitcoin core".  You pointed out his contribution on bitcoin core, but his contribution on core (base) code for bitcoin was gigantic with bitcoinj.
Gavin is more deliberate in choosing his words (in my opinion) than either Amir or Peter.  This is a politically savvy way to get shit done.   GMaxwell is smart as hell (shoot, they all are), and perhaps not quite as careful as Gavin in his comments.   Based on reading comments from both Gavin and Greg, I believe that they truly appreciate the contributions and comments of Peter and Amir, as well as the passion, but get frustrated by the noise.  It causes a bit of a technical soap opera played out for all to see.  
The beauty though is that all these parties care deeply about Bitcoin.  It's just a question of style, and some of the differences are that some follow rules of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" and others don't.  I can picture Amir screaming obscenities and painting a "sky is falling" picture trying to rouse support for his position.   Peter Todd is somewhat similar, but not quite as extreme politically.
I think it's getting harder and harder to make any major changes to the architecture of Bitcoin, simply because of the consensus.  
Whether side chains or tree chains emerge as the leading technology (or something else) is a bit of a crap shoot.  I think investing in Viacoin is a large crapshoot.  And I would *not* base the decision on the fact that they "hired" Peter Todd, unless I saw what sort of commitment that they got from him.  He could simply be a figure-head consultant to add credibility to their web page.  It's been done in this space MANY times before.  Look at how many companies Peter Todd consults with.

Correct that NOW they receive the opposite by default.  Incorrect regarding sidechains.  Namecoin is one of the alts with the highest hash powers because of merged mining.  It is the default for most pools.


I am not sure what you are saying here.  Coin-Du-jour currently starts with a mining power of zero.  See recent incidents with several successful 51% attacks on alts.  Not sure what flawless security record you are referring to, as Bitcoin has had issues.

If you could find the average age of unspent coins, or the cumulative age of unspent coins, it'd be trivial to estimate the ratio, because you can easily estimate the average age of all coins (knowing the rate that they have been released).

I won't be able to refute your points directly with evidence, but I do think that there is some relief in sight.
First, SHA-256 was [announced in hardware on Intel chips](  Not that this will compete directly with large miners, but it may allow the small guy to participate with a PC again.  Still slower than ASICs, but a closer race, and wouldn't require a special hardware purchase.
Second, the concept of Tree Chains can add scalability to Bitcoin while it adds decentralization, and even faster confirmation times.  The concept is that you would mine a subset of transactions (those whose hash starts with some binary pattern for example), and smaller difficulties can generate small rewards, while contributing to an overall stronger Bitcoin.
Consider if you, an Intel PC user, are mining in the zone of transactions that start with 0x1234-. So you are mining 1/65536^ths of the transaction space, for small rewards.  The difficulty level at that portion of the transaction space might be set so that mini-blocks get solved every 10 seconds, for very small rewards.
But if, while mining, you get lucky and solve a block that has a hash that qualifies to solve the 0x123- block, you get a bigger reward.  This will happen maybe every 40 seconds (by someone).  
And if you are really lucky, on occasion, you might solve a block that qualifies to solve the 0x12- block.
And there's an occasional (every ten minutes) big winner that solves the main chain block.
This sort of arrangement might bring back solo mining, decentralization, and faster confirmations.  But it would have to be well tested on an alt coin or test network.

Bitcoins are just a unit of account, allowing you to have an account balance.
Miners are performing the accounting function for Bitcoin (specifically "sequencing" blocks of transactions to prevent double-spending), and they are rewarded by having their account balance increased by 25 Bitcoins when they perform that work successfully.
The "work" that they are doing is guessing a long number that, when "blended" with the digits of the transactions that they are sequencing (as well as the digits that pay themselves, and digits from the previous block), produces a sufficiently small result.  
"Blending" (my word) is really called a "hash function", which is math performed on a bunch of digits that results in a 256-bit number.
"Sufficiently small" is defined by the system meaning that the result needs to be beneath some number, which is defined by the system such that it is so hard that it takes approximately ten minutes for the current collection of miners to find an answer (through random guessing).

Agreed.  You see what Internet Startups are like now.  In 1997-1999, it was like 100x this level of excitement and opportunity.  The easiest way to show you is to look at the NASDAQ, as sort of a proxy for "dollar investments flowing into tech":  [here's a picture from 1996 to present](  
Yes, present is ALMOST caught up to the 2000 peak.  But the investments from 1996-2000 just billions and billions of dollars flying at anything and everything that had to do with technology.  And internet startups had to invest in computers and advertising, and so money was just flowing endlessly.  Money was chasing every opportunity that had a Powerpoint slide deck.
If you were a developer in 1998 with "internet startup" on your resume and had half-a-personality, you could job-shop your way to $150K easy.  And this is in 1998 dollars.  Hell, you could sleep at your desk, and ride that curve up to the top.
I think we're at about "Internet 1996" with Bitcoin.  If we're at "Internet 1990" with Bitcoin, then your 6-year masters program will time well.  But if we're at "Internet 1996" right now, then the Bitcoin Bubble of massive investment is still ahead of us, but may be burst in 6 years.  At which time, sure, there will still be good jobs for good people, for another 20 years.  But the heyday will be over.
Your mileage may vary.  
I wonder if there's a way for you to legally work just for stock options in your own bitcoin business, and if/when it's a moderate success and you can risk it, you exercise your options, and take advantage of this curve.

You addressed that question to someone else, but I'll jump in with my perspective.
Doge offered nothing new except for clever marketing (a moved decimal place so they appeared cheaper, a trendy meme, an "accessible community" - which was merely more clever marketing, and scrypt).
There aren't really many innovations in alts.  I think Ethereum actually has a much better list of new offerings than Doge.  I didn't buy into Doge, and haven't bought into other alts.
But you CAN make money on alts, even if they are pump-and-dumps.  You can even do it somewhat ethically, without doing any pumping yourself (benefiting from others' pumps).    It's a tricky game and highly risky.  Not one I have chosen to participate in.
An analysis I would love to see (and maybe one of the data guys like will be kind enough to put this together) is if a hypothetical investor made a daily move from one currency to another, picking every correct move along the way (including moving out of crypto and into alts) what that would have looked like.  Could you have made a killing hopping in and out of Doge at the right time?  If you started with $1000 in 2009, what would your fortune be worth, making all the right moves, daily?

Freedom isn't about getting stuff for free.  
Democracy isn't about distribution of wealth.
Money is inherently a trust-based commodity, where it's only good if a significant amount of people think it's good.  If I write "$100" on a piece of paper, I may think I am $100 richer, but unless I can convince many other people that my piece of paper is worth something, I'm really just as poor.
The unfair part of the fiat system is that in the US, a private corporation has the ability to print more of those dollars that other people inherently have faith in.   They can literally make you poorer by printing money.  No such thing exists for Bitcoin.
Your complaints about miners is silly, and comes across as just the whining of a jealous, uninformed crybaby.  You can buy a mining machine too, or create a chip to perform fast hashing.  Nothing is stopping you, except that you are busy whining while others did it.

Don't connect the system to the internet.
Look for a file called wallet.dat.  Make a copy of that.
Then, on a virus-free pc, install a bitcoin client.  Electrum might work, bitcoin-qt WILL work but will take a while to download the blockchain (maybe a couple of days).
Then switch the newly created wallet.dat with the old one and restart the client.  If the blockchain is in sync with the network, you should see your bitcoins.  Then encrypt the wallet file.  I'd also transfer the coins to a new address generated separately from that old wallet if it was unencrypted at any point.

You can actually calculate the costs, probabilistically speaking, of mining.  It ends up that with a regular PC, it costs MUCH more in electricity than you get back in Bitcoins.
In 2010 or 2011, programmers figured out a way to use the math processor on video cards to be more cost efficient, and they basically made PCs obsolete for mining.   In 2013, specialized computers called ASICs (chips designed solely for Bitcoin mining) came out, and made graphics PCs obsolete.  Now faster chips are out, and people who bought specialized machines in 2013 are obsolete.
So yeah, if you want Bitcoins, buy them... it's cheaper than buying them by paying your electric bill.

Mt. Gox was the largest.  Noobs, when looking into Bitcoin, would hear about Mt. Gox.  And the exchange that has the most volume will tend to have the least slippage and tightest bid/ask range.

So your belief is that the best way to get the total market cap higher is to dilute the efforts to different coins and somehow pick and choose which are legitimate?
Care to back up that claim with any sort of logic?
I'll give you some logic to discredit it.  There's talent that is being applied to alt-coins in the pursuit of creating the next get-rich-quick scheme.  I don't know what percentage of the overall crypto talent - maybe 1%, maybe 5%.  And the vast majority of clone-coins will likely never amount to anything, if past history is any indication.  (BBQcoin, anyone?)  
If we could increase our talent pool working on Bitcoin by 1% or 5% or whatever the number is, the great product called Bitcoin could improve by some percentage.  Perhaps 1% or 5%.  Perhaps more, due to synergies.  Diverting these energies to create, market, tout, purchase, and mine clone-coins will never produce that kind of a return.  Because 1% or 5% of something huge is far greater than what you can produce on the side (which is likely to fail anyway).


I think it's equally transparent that clone-coins which have no added value are simply pumped up by people who are butt-hurt that they somehow missed the boat on Bitcoin.
I hope alt-coin lovers who want the right to "invest their resources in the coin(s) of their choice" respect my right to do the same, and to invest in Bitcoin exclusively.   If I have a choice of two vendors, and one accepts Bitcoin, while the other excepts Bitcoin and Litecoin, I will support the one who shows consistent values as myself, and puts all their weight behind one arrow.

Well, there's definitely something going on behind closed doors.   Some secret is not being told.  And, the charts showed that Gox has made $14M and 26K BTC in the past 6 months.  Highly unlikely they pissed it all away on a bug, especially with cold storage!
And the future is bright for Bitcoin, so you'd think that it'd be the wrong time for Karpeles to pack it up and leave (as a thief or just close up shop).
So they are sitting on a lot of money.  They must have lost access to it somehow.  And if 90% was in cold storage, that means they either screwed up somehow (forgot where they buried the treasure map), or are being blocked from their cold storage.  And who could block them from their cold storage?

Very sly.
So let me feed back what you just said.  As a recipient of a solved block's IBLT, I can quickly examine it and tell how many transactions are in it (based on the counts) and also how many high priority transactions are in it (these would be transactions that the miner decided to prioritize higher than the canonical order of the mempool).  Right?
So that difference is how many transactions are included, from the canonically sorted mempool.  I can look at my mempool and grab that many transactions, and "guess" that this is the list of transactions that are included in the block.   Then I take every one of those transactions, and without checking, simply subtract them from the copy of the IBLT.
Now I have a reduced IBLT that I can start working with, to deduce what was actually in there.  I can look for entries with "count=1" to find new transactions that were missing.  I can look for entries with "count= MINUS 1" for transactions that I mistakenly included.
And with each 1 or minus 1, I fix my list and adjust the copy of the IBLT, eventually working my way to the correct list.
Presumably with minus 1's, I can also try the next transaction in my mempool to see if that one fits.

Two transactions, one paying for your coffee, and the other paying your utility bill, seems like a bad example.  Since double-spends are not a sure thing, there's a significant chance you'll go without power.

Your fundamental argument seems to be that it's better to use a technology that requires you to remember something and store something (BIP 38) than something that just requires you to remember something (brain wallets).
In security circles, this is basically 2-factor.  The 3 possible factors are "something you have", "something you know", and "something you are".  BIP-38 uses the first two.
Increased security correlates closely to decreased ease-of-use.  And so you are basically running the risk of increasing the likelihood that the money will be lost forever with BIP-38, because, in addition to losing the "thing you know" causing a loss, you can also lose everything by losing the "thing you have".
The counter to this argument is that BIP-38 reduces the likelihood of losing the "thing you know" because it can be much simpler.  But if it is possible for someone to memorize a secure passphrase as simply as memorizing a short BIP-38 passphrase, then your final statement is incorrect.
I contend that there are a few rare individuals for which it is as simple to remember a secure passphrase than a BIP-38 shorter passphrase, which means that your final conclusion is wrong... in SOME RARE CASES, there is a reason to use *secure* brain wallets over BIP38 wallets, and that's because you reduce the likelihood of losing your money forever.

According to my calculations, Gox has made (gross) 25K Bitcoins and $14.1M in commissions in the past six months.  Hard to imagine that this didn't cover operating expenses, even if he was carelessly leaking Bitcoins to thieves due to malleability.  These aren't stolen funds (as you claim I say), these are legitimate fees, paid willingly by his customers.
The basis of my theory is that the US Government is forcing him to hide his insolvency, just as they tried to force lavabit into lying about the confidentiality and security of their email.  Only in Gox's case, they had the muscle to FORCE him to, with the threat of prison time of charges already filed.  The government didn't have that leverage with lavabit. 
The US has tried to force businesses to lie to their customers before, and they'll do it again.  It's just a question of whether they are doing it in this case.

I recognize you as someone who typically knows his shit, regarding Bitcoin.  I get your point, but I'm going to disagree with you on this one.
I think this terminology helps people who understand traditional accounting or bank balances.
I have one of those addresses, with *a balance* which is made up of about 200 individual transactions, and I am trying to figure out what the heck to do with it now.  I knew it might end up to be an issue.
It's an unfortunate result of pool mining, and not wanting to leave the bitcoins online with a pool, and not wanting to allow someone to change the payout address.
Not sure if I should bite the bullet and pay it all to one address, with a fee, or to bleed it out by adding an input to each of my next 200 transactions.

If a company doesn't care about customers or market perception, and is "beholden to no one but themselves", they could choose to hang up on all customer service calls, because - "fuck 'em, we already have your money, we don't need your service calls."
And then those companies should be punished by the market.  It's a checks-and-balances thing.  
Same thing here.  GHash.io had no obligation, and is only beholden to themselves.  And they behaved in a way that encourages outrage.  They should be punished.

Your wallet has a key to unlock (spend) the coins sent to a particular address.
So, when you send money from Coinbase to your phone, you choose an address that your phone provides you, and you give that to Coinbase.  The transfer happens in the "giant shared ledger in the sky" (that is, the ledger is shared among all bitcoin nodes in a peer-to-peer network).  
So every node knows that a certain address "holds" those bitcoins.  When you want to spend them, you need to utilize the key stored in your wallet.
So, nothing really gets sent to your phone (except that your phone monitors the ledger, to see when the bitcoins are associated with that address).

I think it's more likely that they suffered a major loss between 2011 and now (could have been in 2011), and didn't really know it until they needed to tap their cold wallet.
It works like this:
1)  Mt. Gox has a wallet file which contains the usual information, state of the art in 2011:  the private keys and the bitcoin addresses.   In 2011, this was the amount of 424242 BTC, which was proven that they had ownership.
2)  Sometime since the last "proof of access", the hacker copied the file for personal use, and then modified the contents of that file to corrupt the private keys, while leaving the bitcoin addresses in tact.
**Why not steal the money then, you ask?  Well, if Gox thinks their wallet is still good, then they keep making cold storage deposits and the amount grows!**
This is the piece that no one talks about, and I am revealing it for the first time here, under pure speculation.
It was a clever gamble on the part of the hacker.  Why not steal the bitcoins later!  Instead of stealing back in 2011, they just open a pipe, so that Mt. Gox keeps sending them money on an ongoing basis.  The risk was that Gox would discover the ruse, or have backup copies of the wallet.  So the longer they could wait for the backup copies to fade out of existence, the higher the probability of success.
3)  For years, when Karpeles looked at his wallet, he could see that a) he had the private keys (corrupted, though), and b) the bitcoin addresses were fully funded, and growing from 424,242 to 750,000 BTC.  Half-ass "audits" of the funds were successful, as everything looks ok at a glance.
4)  Transaction Malleability and other Gox issues caused Karpeles to need to tap the cold storage.  (This may have been last July.  It may have been in February.)  He went "oh shit, I don't have access to the money."  This was when he said the funds were "temporarily inaccessible" a few weeks ago.  He kept the exchange open, perhaps legally so (?) thinking that he would find a good backup of the wallet.
5)  They scrambled for 19 days looking for a backup that had the correct, uncorrupted keys.  This would be a backup from 2011 or earlier.  No such luck.  So they filed for bankruptcy protection.
6)  The hackers realized that their days of continual faucet of bitcoins to the cold storage were over, so they strategized about how to finally empty those bitcoin addresses.   They concluded that the best way to do it would be to use Gox's own mixing code (further implicating Karpeles to the masses), and that's what you saw happening last week.
OK, now I await my phone to ring, with a call from the authorities (or from TwoBitIdiot) on how I know all this....

Today's architecture requires the block size to scale proportional to the transactions per second.
This new proposal relies on the fact that each miner is already receiving all of the transactions separately.  All they need to know is which transactions to include in the block.  
And in fact, we'll communicate which transactions are included in the block in such a way that if you are familiar with a large percentage of them (by maintaining your own mempool), then you'll be able to deduce the remainder.
So, no, the block size does not HAVE to be increased.  By increasing it, we can improve the probabilities of success.  I didn't check to see if Gavin is recommending a specific block size, but I imagine that will be determined in testing.
@_date: 2014-09-01 16:11:40
Fun fact:  If the block hasn't been solved after 162 minutes, you'd still expect it to happen over the *next* ten minutes (or eight minutes, if that's the recent average).  It's not any more likely to happen in the next minute as it was in the first minute after all miners begin working on it.

But don't forget, "all" it takes for Bitcoin to be worth a million dollars is for nearly everyone to simultaneously quit selling them all at once.  If, at that point, one single satoshi changes hands for a penny, then a bitcoin is worth a million bucks at the spot price, and Satoshi is a trillionaire.
Obviously I am speaking in extremes to make a point:  that it doesn't take a trillion dollars to cause Bitcoins to be worth a million each.  It could take as little as a penny.

[That chart]( is interesting, but there's really no basis presented to say why the company's market cap needs to be beneath the value of all bitcoins in existence.

It will fluctuate.  Because of supply and demand.
Those are the simple reasons.  The more complicated reasons are the 3600+ coins that get mined every day (causing downward pressure), and the progress being made in adoption and awareness (causing upward pressure).  Some say that vendor acceptance is a downward pressure, but I see that downward pressure out-weighed by increased adoption and awareness.
Then there's the psychology part:
Believers in the technology are probably in as deep as they are comfortable investing.  More income from their day job may cause some additional investment.  Price fluctuations may cause them to either reduce their exposure (out of nervousness or because it gets out of balance) or increase their exposure (not wanting to miss the next "bubble").
Non-believers won't be investing.  
And people just getting exposure to Bitcoin will be a net positive (because some will be believers, while the non-believers will rarely be involved to sell-short).
Major events could cause major fluctuations - like legal issues in New York, the laundering trial in Florida, more laws, more senate hearings, Bitcoin EFTs, etc.

I don't think so.  
He has an agreement in place with every one of his account holders, based on the terms of the registration.  He is unable to uphold an agreement to return the money or bitcoins to the account holders (although ... I haven't looked at that agreement in a long time - maybe they aren't liable for losses (!)).
So now he files for protection.  If he goes out of business, the assets will be divided up, and paid out to the creditors on a priority and pro-rated basis, like any normal bankruptcy.  He gets zero, and the creditors get cents on the dollar (18 cents as I recall, based on their asset-to-liability ratio mentioned in the leaked draft document).
So BEST case if you are an account holder is that you'll see 18 cents on the dollar if there's a full bankruptcy.  (Take out legal fees, and it's probably more like ten cents on the dollar.)
If he can convince account holders that it's in their best interest to let him continue on as a business, in the hopes of getting more than ten cents on the dollar, then he can strike deals with them.  If enough people agree to the terms, then he can prove solvency.  
If I were him, I would be focused on convincing the very large account holders that they want to do better than ten cents on the dollar.   (That means that he would likely avoid all communications with the masses of smaller account holders.)   If he can convince the large holders of his plan, then he's back in business.  
Then he can offer the small holders whatever deal he wants, but if you don't take it, then your bitcoins and cash may be tied up for a long time. (and you may ultimately see less than ten cents on the dollar.)  It'll be your choice, and it'll likely be better than 10 cents on the dollar.  But it won't be much better.

If the spread varies between exchanges - like, if you compare two, and sometimes it's a positive difference, and sometimes it's a negative difference, then you can arbitrage without performing withdrawals.

Well, the way that would work, as explains, is that you could spend it at the grocery, and then double-spend it somewhere else, reversing the spend at the grocery.
So, while the clerk's paranoia might be a little bit overblown, it is possible to reverse an unconfirmed transaction ("a lot easier than most people realise" as Peter Todd says.) 
Given that credit card transactions can be reversed 90 days later, it doesn't seem like a huge risk.

*Bits* have been units of currency long before they were units of information (apparently since about 1794).  When coins were sub-divided to "Pieces of Eight", each bit was one eighth of a coin, and 2 bits were a quarter.
That's why, to this day, 2-bits refers to $0.25.

For instance, one change was implemented with months and months of warning, such that when at least 50% of the blocks for the day or week were being mined with the new format, the switch was activated to happen on block   (I'm probably not describing that exactly correctly.)

There's a little bit of misinformation in that thread [here](  It says that Satoshi premined for a week, but that is not accurate.
He created the genesis block on 3-Jan (which has an unspendable block reward), and [announced his project]( on 9-Jan.  But [Block 1]( - the first spendable coins - were not mined until 9-Jan.
14 Blocks were mined on 9-Jan, so at the most, that was the amount he pre-mined (probably less, possibly zero, but I am too lazy to do time zone conversions).  Most likely, he was debugging between 3-Jan and 9-Jan, and once he was comfortable, made the announcement, throwing away all the blocks he had tested with.

Ripple was a fortified wine produced by E &amp; J Gallo Winery[2] that was popular in the United States, particularly in the 1970s. Possessing a relatively low 11% ABV, it was originally marketed to "casual" drinkers.[3] Due to its low price, it had a reputation as a drink for alcoholics and the destitute. It was popular among young drinkers, both underage and college students. The TV series Sanford &amp; Son often referred to Ripple, as it was Fred Sanford's alcoholic beverage of choice.[4]

You are wrong with the smaller group (~29K BTC).  They were seized.  And the feds took it to a judge, and the judge rules that they are property of the US gov't because they were part of a felony operation of money laundering and drug selling.  Those coins were basically "on account" on the server, held by SR on behalf of the buyers and sellers.

With a statement like that, you are demonstrating that you don't really understand the economics.
As you said elsewhere:


The *utillity* doesn't need to change for the value to change (or for the price to be "worth it"); the *interest and popularity* needs to change.
If 210M people find it interesting enough to want to hold $100 worth of Bitcoins (for investment, everyday spending, or even novelty), then the total Bitcoin value is $21B, or at least $1000 per bitcoin.  Those are the numbers you need to be looking at, not how much "utility in a bitcoin" there is for you.

The capabilities of Bitcoin barely change with the price.   Bitcoin is as strong as ever, because the technology is exactly the same system as it was two months ago.  The ecosystem is actually stronger than it was two months ago, because there are more vendors, and more large vendors accepting it.
Yeah, there are glitches with exchanges, but those existed two months ago, and they are now repaired or in the state of "being repaired" right now, which makes the ecosystem stronger.
The ONLY way that the price effects the capability of Bitcoin is that two months ago (for a VERY short period)  you could store and transmit $15B, and now you can only store and transmit $8B.  But no one is trying to transmit large volumes yet, so this is relatively a non-factor.
The key is that things in the ecosystem are stronger now than they were 2 months ago.  And the $1200 price was a ridiculous effect of irrational exuberance that drove the price to unsustainable levels.  The price was the same as it is now on November 20th and on December 18.  Nine days of irrationality after 11/20 took the price to unsustainable levels.

I think it's a simple matter of Bitcoin being on a long term path toward a much much higher valuation.  The higher valuation becomes realized if and when bitcoin is *widely* accepted as a secure, inexpensive transfer mechanism.
As time goes on, it becomes more widely accepted (so far), and it's more believable that this higher valuation can be attained. 
But it won't be a straight-line path... there will be periods where the market is frothy (bubbles and crashes).  It's not that bitcoin changes, it's that people act irrational for periods.  Short term irrationality (such as last November's $1100) are much more common than long-term irrationality.

The other assumption in this formula is that bitcoins transfer once per year.  It's far more likely that bitcoins would be used as a transfer mechanism and then converted to fiat.  So maybe it would be 30 times per year.
So divide your $308 by 30, and you are down to $10.
...but you also assume 13 million coins are "in play", which might be off by a factor of 100.  So we're up to $1000/ BTC.

You seem to be confusing blockchain.info with the blockchain.  It's not in the blockchain until it's confirmed.
blockchain.info is one source.  People all over the internet are other sources.  Different people can have different (conflicting) unconfirmed transactions.  
However, the confirmation process is like "closing the books" in accounting.  We all agree that this list of transactions are the correct ones.  And whoever mines the block gets to decide (and it won't be blockchain.info, most likely).
Even a single confirmation has a little risk, but the risk drops off tremendously after several confirmations.
However, you are correct that if a transaction hits blockchain.info, chances are very high that it won't get double spent elsewhere.

I'll try to be objective on this:
Weighing in on Danny's side:
I have a lot of respect for people who are trying stuff to get Bitcoin off the ground.  Some stuff works, some doesn't.  But Danny gets a lot of points with me for trying.
Danny's early results were great.  Good video, looked very promising.  
If he set out to defraud people from the start, he sure as hell wouldn't have done it as a public figure.   It's easy enough to get people to invest in you in this community as an anonymous person; why risk revealing your identity?
It is very possible that Mt. Gox's failure put a crimp in plans.  I don't discount that possibility at all.
Most investors who are crying foul are probably in over their heads, or don't realize that sometimes businesses fail, even with honest leaders and good business plans.  And I bet many of the vocal ones are screaming over losing a relatively small amount.  There's no minimum loss requirement to carry a pitchfork around here.
I appreciate the fact that he is releasing information, and agree that it's far too early to accuse someone of fraud.

bad math here (and bad spelling).
Say a mining rig costs $2 per day in electricity (and labor), and nets $1 per day worth of Bitcoins in January.  Say Bitcoins triple in price by June.  So in June, you could claim that your mining rig was profitable during January (comparing $3 to the cost of $2), but that'd be bad math.
Had you instead spent the $2 on Bitcoins, you'd have $6 by June.  That mining rig lost 50% in January, whether you compare the $2 -&gt; $1, or the $6 -&gt; $3.

I don't think you captured his argument accurately.  He said:


Basically it's not that they aren't pricing their items in Bitcoin.  It's that they are immediately converting to fiat.
And I also think this is a short term issue, but not a long term issue.  The reasons companies convert to fiat is because they can't easily spend their Bitcoin for products and services, and because of the volatility.  Both of those issues can be resolved in the long term with wider acceptance.

I'm not sure if Electrum uses Bloom Filters yet (it didn't, originally), but the concept of Bloom Filters in SPV clients is that the client requests a group of transactions by giving a filter.  But it could do this in multiple requests.
From a [Stack Overflow]( answer:


So, to answer your question more directly, your Client using Bloom Filters could request its relevant transactions in multiple requests, which might link `1BashCo` address to a bunch of addresses (one of which is yours), and another `1BashCo` address to a different set of addresses (one of which is yours).  And the only person who could potentially "see" that linkage is the particular SPV peer or a man in the middle.  (and you could ask different things from different peers).
So it's not all that trivial.  Pretty good protection actually.  
Of course, normal Blockchain taint analysis might link more of your addresses together.

well, there's that too.  Miners are rewarded when they "lock in" transactions.
Basically, the system (Bitcoin) was cleverly designed to reward those individuals who process transactions, by paying them in the very currency that they are protecting.
Every ten minutes (on average), some lucky miner is rewarded with 25 Bitcoins for finding the number that locks recent transactions into the ledger.   Since 25 Bitcoins is about $14,000, it's very competitive, and so people will actually pool their resources (sort of like going into an office pool to buy lottery tickets).
A definition of Mining that I saw elsewhere today:  Bitcoin Mining is the process of looking for a rare number that is the missing piece to a calculation over a bunch of new transactions where the result needs to be sufficiently small.

What you state is obviously technically true, but I think there's an inherent hidden fallacy / assumption in this statement. 
The underlying fallacy is that governments aren't currently magically creating more currency (like dollars) out of nothing.  Instead, they are "taxing" the existing holders of money with each creation of new money, as well as future citizens with debt.  And, while they can do a whole lot of this in the current system, it's not unlimited; at some point, the current system comes crashing down.
In a bitcoin-only economy, I believe the same effect can be achieved.  A government can be holding a substantial amount of bitcoins, and release some as they feel necessary to smooth out the economic cycles.  They can also borrow bitcoins, "national debt" style (you can do that on bitfinex right now), and they can also tax future generations to pay off that debt.

Actually, it's good to tell people the facts about mining.  The facts now are that mining machines are overpriced.  NOT that it's too late, but that the price you pay for the mining machine makes a HUGE difference as to whether you'll ever be profitable.
Right now, ASIC companies are OVER-CHARGING for their equipment.  And that's because too many noobs don't understand the math, and fall for the "miner's fallacy" (that i can lose money on a daily basis, but make it up with an increase in price per bitcoin).
The more people are set straight, the more likely ASIC companies will be forced to get their prices in line with the value.  Having noobs drive up the price of mining equipment isn't helping to decentralize the network.  It's artificially supporting the price of ASICs.  Lower priced ASICs would help decentralize the network.
It's kinda like the argument against a high minimum wage....

I think you are taking the wrong path for this article.  It's not up to the college to try to make Bitcoin more successful - you are setting yourself up for a tough argument.
A better approach would be to take two approaches:      
1) Bitcoin is a good thing (or at least not a bad thing), and      
2) It'd be good for the college to accept Bitcoin *for their own benefit*.
1) bitcoin is a good thing because - lower fees than credit cards, cuts out the middleman, banks or governments can't cut off payments simply because they don't like the message that the college is teaching, some unelected official can't decide to print more money on a whim (unlike the US Dollar), making everyone else's money worth less, etc.
2)  Good for the college because:  they would be considered "leading edge", perhaps ahead of their peers, they can immediately convert to dollars/euros whatever, there are minimal fees, they would be offering another payment option to their customers (CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!), payments are irreversible, they get their money almost instantly (credit cards can have chargebacks months later).

According to the prospectus, the price of a share will approximate one fifth of a bitcoin, if I recall correctly. There are subtle differences (like there's a fee that you don't have with Bitcoin, and the amount of shares that you get when you buy will be based on averages for that day, as opposed to the spot price for that second that you buy.)
But overall, it's expected to track the Bitcoin price with a slight load for maintenance and storage.
They will buy or sell bitcoins to keep the ETF funded in approximately the same amount of bitcoins as shares that are purchased (times 5).

Reading between the lines of your message, one can derive an upper bound for the value of the bitcoin network (and therefore the "market cap" and therefore an upper limit of the price per bitcoin).
The upper limit of market cap could be estimated to be the net value of a 51% attack.  This net value would be the amount you could successfully gain from the attack, minus the costs.  Because if someone or some organization could gain from an attack, they probably would.
Say you can liquidate $15M before you get shut down, on say a current market cap of $5B, and say that figure scales linearly, so you can always quickly liquidate 0.3%.  If the current cost of an attack is $180M, and that was 0.3% of the market cap, that means that if the market cap were $60B right now, it'd be economically feasible to conduct such an attack for profit.
That means that at the current cost of an attack, the price per bitcoin is capped at about $4500, because if it were any higher than $4500/BTC, it'd be economically feasible for someone to profit from such an attack (given my liquidity assumptions, of course).  And as Bitcoin becomes more liquid (i.e. higher percentage than 0.3% being able to be liquidated after an attack), the cap on bitcoin price is actually reduced.

Why do you think that Karpeles is the only one who could have stolen the keys?  
It should be obvious that the keys were held online.   A more plausible explanation is that someone stole the online keys, and changed them.  Karpeles thought he had good keys only to find out he didn't.  The thief didn't make it obvious that the keys were stolen long ago, until about a week or so ago, when he started mixing the coins.

I think I see the issue you are pointing out.
As I understand it, the copy of the IBLT, once all of the known transactions are subtracted out, would likely contain entries of the following format:
**Count = 1**   
KEY = some TXID concatenated with some Section number*  
VALUE = some bits from the actual transaction data.
Once you have that, then you can cycle through all section numbers (1 to n) and pull out all of the relevant transaction data.   In other words, take that same TXID, and append section 1 to it, and hash it. and remove it from the table.
This technique seems to be dependent on the probability that all segments of all unknown transactions will not have hash collisions.
\* The minor detail that I gloss over is that Gavin is proposing that the Key be XORed with some value to reduce DOS attacks on particular transactions.

With Bloom Filters, it's not nearly this obvious.
It's more like "My IP address is w.x.y.x; can you give me all of the transactions related to all the bitcoin addresses that have G as the 5th letter?"
(Above example is simplified and lying for understandability.  Actually it says more like "... all the bitcoin addresses that, when you hash them, they show a positive hit (one) against this binary filter of zeros and ones.")
Also, the concern isn't necessarily that they can connect your IP address to your bitcoin address.  It's that they can collect information across bitcoin addresses, so that when you send your church a donation, they are also able to see that your last transaction was from MegaPornAndDildos.com (because that's where the pastor shops).

By paying an extra high fee, we can provide incentive to the miners to fork the chain.  The fee we charge is calculated as follows:
1) You must cover the fees and block rewards for any blocks that have already been mined, that you are trying to undo.  This is only fair to compensate the previously successful miner.  (This will encourage the miner that successfully mined the block to work against his own past success, as well as encourage others to mine for a fork.)
2)  You must provide two more block reward amounts (to provide extra incentive to fork).

Gotcha.  And I agree.  Money is going to move around, with Bitcoin, but I suspect that some of the rich will get richer.
Frankly, the First World is rich compared to the Third World, and the vast majority of early adopters are in the First World.  Even if you are near the bottom of "the 99%" in the US, you are probably in the upper 1% of the world.  So it's always funny to hear someone from the US complain about the 1% being rich.

First, no it doesn't work that way.  (In order to do what you are suggesting, a new version of the software would need to be created that allows a bogus block to be added to the chain.  This would cause a hard fork for all the people (not just miners, but all full nodes) who did not implement this upgrade.)
Second, you are punishing the 94% for the benefit of the 6%.  Unlikely that you'd get a majority.
Third, You are suggesting that the funds get returned to the very party who proved themselves untrustworthy.  Which sounds like a horrible idea.

Not to mention, we're in the price-discovery phase.  The amount of people who touch Yen every year barely changes, while the amount of people who have touched Bitcoin is probably 2000 times greater now than it was one year ago, and may be 100+ times greater a year from now.
Volatility is expected until Bitcoin approaches market saturation or at least stabilization, neither of which we appear to be near.

Just attempting to simplify the explanation:
Some time ago, an investor borrowed about 3000 Bitcoins and sold them for approximately $505\*, betting that the price would drop.  Naturally this caused a little immediate downward pressure on the price.
A couple of hours ago, they closed that position, meaning that they bought the Bitcoins back for cheaper prices (somewhere between approximately $470 and $477), causing a little immediate upward pressure on the price.
So, this investor (gambler?) made approximately $30 x 3000 = about $90K, minus the daily interest that they had to pay on the borrowed bitcoins, and any transaction fees.   Make a $2M bet, get a $90K payoff.  Not too shabby.  Makes me feel fairly insignificant!
\* The $505 price was mentioned by [someone else]( who noticed that the swaps around that price point took a 3000 BTC drop at the same time.

Right now, there is no technical solution in place to discourage pools growing to above 50%.  My preference would be a technical solution, so we don't have to rely on people's actions.
But a technical solution is not here yet.  So that means we're relying on actions of others as follows:
1)  We rely on miners to avoid signing up with the largest pool.  This safeguard failed.   
2)  We rely on miners to switch when a pool gets too large.  This safeguard failed.  
3)  We rely on a pool to take actions to resist growing too big (such as refusing new customers, raising prices, etc.)  This safeguard failed.  
4)  Once a pool exceeds 50%, some say we should rely on their goodness and rely on others to watch them and raise an alert if there are shenanigans.  
I say that once 3 safeguards have failed, we shouldn't rely on a fourth and fifth one that are also likely to fail.  Instead, we should try to fix safeguard 1, 2, and 3, by punishing them so that no other company lets safeguards 1, 2, and 3 fail again.
It's a lot like raising children or a pet.  You need to make sure that consequences to their actions are immediate, tangible, and direct.  Otherwise behavior isn't changed in the future.

There is a spectrum of users that range from:
acquire and sell every day   
to  
acquire and sell weekly  
to  
acquire and sell monthly     
to  
acquire and sell quarterly    
to   
acquire and sell annually    
to  
acquire and never sell  
Every user is somewhere in that spectrum.  They may move around, depending on their needs or mood.
One user, Satoshi, is in the bottom classification. He has never sold.  
Somehow you think that THAT end of the spectrum is causing volatility.
It should be painfully obvious to anyone who gives it any thought that it's the other end of the spectrum that causes volatility.  In fact, if everyone was at the bottom of the spectrum, there would be *no* volatility.
Or, look at it another way.  Presumably there are people in every classification in that spectrum, at the present time, and at spots in  between.   MANY of the issued Bitcoins are in the lower part of that spectrum, especially since Satoshi has a great deal of them.  If you took all the bitcoins and spread them equally among people all over in that spectrum, there would be *more* sellers, not less.  And you've already stated that sellers are the cause of volatility.  So you are advocating moving to *more* sellers, not less, by advocating that there should be less hoarders.  This is illogical.
I think if you spend 2 minutes thinking about this, it should be obvious.

The terms "undervalued" and "overvalued" are used quite a bit when talking about stocks.   Sometimes when I hear that term, I have that same reaction that you did - that the market price is determining the value.
But what analysts usually mean when they say a stock is undervalued is that the market value is less than the analysts' opinion of where it should be.

I think it will improve confirmation times, in that transactions with appropriate fees are more likely to be included in the next block.  Contrary to today's situation where miners have incentive to keep blocks small by leaving out transactions.
I think that the missing block data can be algorithmically reconstructed if you know enough of the confirmed transactions.  If not, then there's still a very high chance that you'll be able to figure out the TXID of missing transactions and then request that particular transaction (or transactions).

Funny thing is, most of that money, and more, will come into the market once the momentum shifts upward.   And we'll end up higher than before the news.  Very few people are out for good, and some people are entering the market at these cheaper prices.
So the winners are the ones buying at the bottom, plus the exchanges.  Many of the people trying to time the market will get burned.

Tell me how an employer or a shareholder (being a member of the set "everyone") benefits from every employee knowing how much everyone else makes.
If the employer doesn't benefit, then the company as an entity doesn't, as I suspect costs would go up.  And if costs go up, then it's likely prices will go up.  And then customers also wouldn't benefit.

Paper Wallets are a way to store your Bitcoin balance on paper.  The concept is that hackers can't easily attack a piece of paper.  You can store it using traditional (offline) methods, like a safe.
Basically, you print out a piece of paper (from bitaddress.org or bitcoinpaperwallet.org or coinbase.com) and, on it is a private key and a bitcoin address.   Then you send bitcoins to the bitcoin address, and put the paper away.  You can see the bitcoins viewing them on blockchain.info.
When you want to bring them back online, you import the private key (using Coinbase or blockchain.info, or your local client - electrum, or bitcoin-QT or whatever) and then you have your bitcoins back in your online wallet.

Her exact quote:


I'm one of those guys that says all value is subjective.   But remove the word "intrinsic" for a second.  In support of her argument, there is a potential use for it, and the ability to use Bitcoin is what gives it value.
Bitcoin existed on January 3, 2009.  But it was like the guy with the first fax machine.  Does it have value when it's just Satoshi mining, and you can't spend it, trade it, transport it?  It's hard to believe it has value.  But once you can use it, it has value.  
Probably better worded:  "The more widely it is used (i.e. offered and accepted), the more value it has."  
Is that "intrinsic" value?  There's something intrinsic to it, at that point in time, but it's based on the desire of the masses to offer and accept it.

Since these BIPs can be confusing, I'll explain.  The way the block reward halving is implemented, the reward is calculated by taking 50 and bit-shifting it to the right by a certain number, which is the block number (height) divided by 210000.
So at Block 210000, the bit shift is 1, effectively dividing the block reward by 2, to 25.
At Block 420000, the bit shift is 2, effectively dividing the block reward by 4, to 12.5.
This works great up to 63.  But since there's no specification in C++ as to what to do if you take a 64-bit number and shift it 64 bits, it's undefined.
And what happens on many C++ compilers is that they just pass that decision on to the hardware to define it.  And in the case of the most popular PC and server equipment, what the hardware does is it doesn't even look at the high order bits of the shifting amount.... so 64 = 0, 65 = 1, 66 = 2, etc.
This means that at block number 210000*64, the block reward is currently programmed to be 50 again.   Oops.
This is an urgent situation that should be addressed within the next 200 years!   If miners are alive who could benefit from this, they may not want to change it.

Bitcoin may be the greatest invention of the 2000's so far.  In the first time in history, you can send value *directly* to nearly anyone in the world, nearly instantly, nearly free.
It's expected to disrupt the financial industry much like email disrupted the post office.
As a payment system, it saves money for merchants, by providing inexpensive, irreversible transactions, reducing fees and fraud.   For consumers, it avoids the need to transmit confidential information such as Credit Card number, pin, and CCV/CVC, or bank account number, which jeopardizes security.

The entire transactional data is "encoded" into the IBLT, through hints, like the "remainder" example I gave.
I'll make my example slightly more complicated, to explain it.  Each transaction is just a bit stream, right?  A series of 1's and 0's.  But we're going to break up each transaction into little segments.
So Transaction id  segment  will be the first bits, and TXID  S will be the second set of bits, etc.  These can look like:
    [(TXID-1,1), first bits]
    [(TXID-1,2), second bits]
    
    [(TXID-2,1), first bits of the second transaction]
    [(TXID-2,2), second bits of the second transaction]
and so on.
And if you look at the first part of that as a "key" and the second part as a "value", now you have something that can be encoded into the IBLT.
The key (e.g. one of  [TXID-1,1], [TXID-1,2], etc) can be encoded as single fixed-length bit pattern.  And the value (the segment of the transaction data) can also be a fixed length bit pattern.
So in Gavin's implementation (as I understand it), he takes the keys, and runs them through hashing algorithms.  (in my example, the hashing algorithms were the remainder functions when dividing by 7 or 19).  These hashing algorithms give you an index into a table where you can store information about the value.  When dividing by 7, the remainder gives you a position in a 7-entry table, and when dividing by 19, the remainder is an index into a 19-entry table.
Multiple entries can "hash" to the same table spot.  (in my example, 16 and 23 both have remainders of 2, when divided by 7).  So it's important to store information about each entry that hits that spot, so that if one of the transactions is missing, it can be recreated.
Gavin's implementation stores 3 pieces of data:
- A count (how many segments hashed to this index).
- A sum of the KEYS that hashed here (this can be an XOR, not an arithmetic total)  
- A sum of the VALUES that hashed here (again, XOR).
So, a recipient of the IBLT can grab a transaction from their mempool, and hash the [TXID, 1], to look for the first segment, and see if it appears with a count of "1".   If count=0, then this transaction is NOT included in the block.   If count=1, then the KEY sum and the VALUE sum should match the known values, and then you know it's included in the block.  If count&gt;1, then you don't know much yet.  You can guess that it's in there, or you can come back to it later, and check [TXID, 2] and see if that tells you anything.  
Eventually, you'll be able to deduce which known transactions are both in your mempool and in the solved block.  So you delete those from your COPY of the IBLT, and you are left with a bunch of data that tells you the contents of the missing transactions.

I agree.  But some things haven't changed (or changed much):
-  Human nature (greed, holders, etc.)    
-  Market Saturation  
-  Bitcoin's technical underpinnings   
-  People's tendency to believe past performance as an indicator, leading to sell-fulfilling prophecies.  
My personal belief is that these patterns will repeat a few more times, with smaller up-sides each time.  The patterns won't match exactly, but they'll be close enough for the chartists to say "I told you so".  I think we'll see a bottom near 600 very soon (if not already), and a bubble in the June timeframe of ~5 times the bottom.  And then another pullback to roughly 2x the last peak.
I'm not saying that to try to convince you that this is what will happen, but to try to convince you that some people are thinking somewhat like I am thinking (with some variations), and will back that up with investments that will reinforce their own beliefs in chart-reading, thereby leading to something similar to that happening.

Certain goods are routinely priced in Bitcoin *now*.   For example, it is very common to price other cryptocurrencies only in Bitcoin, because it is by far easier to buy them with Bitcoin than with any other currency.  Pricing them in dollars makes little sense, because the first thing you need to do is to buy Bitcoins, to buy your other crypto-currency.
I would expect that the next wave of items to be priced primarily in Bitcoin would be other digital goods, such as articles online, books, movies, music, 3D rendering maps, etc.

Transaction Fees are not being subsidized by mining rewards.  Mining itself is.
Subsidies change behavior.  They do not change cost, they encourage higher cost participants to participate, which changes *average* cost.  Huge difference.
If you are a high-cost producer in the field of green energy, such that you'd lose money if you participated, you would likely stay out of the field of green energy.

If you ignore the desire for low variance, you may as well solo-mine, for the ultimate variance experience.   
You can look at solo-mining (reductio absurdum) to see why variance matters.  With solo-mining, even with a decent amount of hash power, you may **never** mine a block.  This is because as time goes on, the network hash power increases,  So your best chance of mining a block is *now*.  So immediate payback is important.
So this is not a tragic fixation, this is a smart business decision.  Get something now, vs. nothing over a long period.


Nothing, but this is not a factor at this time.  Making it easier for people to sign up for P2Pool using other people's full nodes will elevate P2Pool to a DESIRABLE pool (which it isn't now), and the rest takes care of itself.

Keep trying to understand.  You aren't there yet.


This is nonsense. To quote you, "It's simple math".
Here, let me give you the math.
If beer costs X in dollars and the exchange rate is (E dollars = 1 bitcoin), then beer costs X/E bitcoins.  There's no "higher because it was bitcoins".  It's the exchange rate.  It didn't get bigger because you had to do some math, unless you suck at math.


You didn't lose $499 on buying beer.  You lost $499 on bitcoin speculation.  And, surprise, you can also MAKE $499 on speculation.  Furthermore, you can actually position the beer buying before the spending of Bitcoin.  There are all sorts of potential scenarios, of which you cite one, and apparently claim this is some huge flaw.
So you are contriving a specific example to demonstrate some supposed flaw in bitcoin, when really this is just a fact of currency - that they fluctuate (up and down), and so an equal counter-argument (which I have made, and you have failed to grasp) is that the opposite argument has just as much validity as your argument.   
You contrive some example, but when I pose the exact reverse example to demonstrate the flaw in your logic, you say I am desperate to frame a situation in a positive light (which is essentially the same as you saying that *you* are desperate to frame a situation in a *negative* light).
It goes both ways.  If you can't get that, you need to do some serious examination of your logic.

I agree.  And this is because Litecoin is less secure.
A coin's exposure to a 51% attack is inversely correlated to the strength of the influence of an individual user to thwart such an attack.
In other words, the "strong influence" of one user (or a community) is exactly the same thing that causes Litecoin to be less secure.  If a small number of users has that influence to be able to thwart a 51% attack, then they have a high influence to *cause* a 51% attack.
This does not speak highly of Litecoin, but rather the opposite.

Like you are five, eh?
Let's say you were at Kindergarten, and at 10:00 AM, you promised to sell a Pokemon card that you have at home to your friend Bobby, and so he gave you $10.  Then you called your mom at home at 11:00 AM, and said, "Quick, Mom. Sell that pokemon card to Jimmy."
Now, there's a math problem that says "which is earlier, 10 AM or 11 AM?"  And solving that has some value, especially to Bobby.
Further, if there could be a math problem that "locked in" the 10 AM transaction, so that the 11 AM transaction could never be done, that would have value.
And having value is the same thing as being "worth money".
Edit:  this example probably works better if you agree to sell your entire Pokemon Card Collection for some price, and the price is agreed to because Bobby has seen your entire collection.  Then, after the agreement, you try to stiff Bobby by secretly selling half of the collection to someone else.   The Kindergarten Courts would need to sort out what transaction happened first.  With a transaction time-stamping service, math can be used to sort that out very simply.  And that's what Bitcoin is.

The analogy I have heard is that the miners are taking a stack of transactions (think of paper checks) and putting a giant humongous paper-weight on top of it.  And if you picture ALL of the miners working together to push this giant 2-ton paperweight onto the checks, you can imagine that it would be very difficult for someone else to move the paperweight out of the way.
"Work" in the sense of moving a large object requires an equivalent amount of work in the opposite direction to "un-do" it.
The way the miners prove that they performed work on the stack of transactions is to hunt for a number that solves the block.  And the SHA-256 function provides a 1-way function that is hard to do, but easy to prove that the work was done.   It's hard to push a 2-ton paperweight into place, but it's easy to see that the paperweight is in place.
The whole reason for SHA-256 is that "1-way" feature.  The "work" being performed is picking a number (called nonce) to append to the transactions' numbers, and do the hashing function with the hopes of generating a sufficiently small result.  You can't "solve for nonce".  It's 1-way.  But anyone can review your nonce, and see, yes, you found the needle for this particular haystack.
If you think of a hashing function resulting in some seemingly random bit-string (like a set of coin flips as the result), there's a 50/50 chance of the leading bit being a 0, given a randomly selected nonce.  There's a 25% chance that it will start with 2 zeros, and 12.5% chance of 3 zeros.  Well, right now, they are trying to solve blocks by selecting nonce values that produce strings of 52 zeros (or something in that range).  So you have to pick a shitload of random nonces to find one that works.  And by finding one, you can "prove" that the network of miners put A LOT of work into solving that block (or they were extremely lucky!)
This work is hard to un-do.
Does that help?

You haven't thought that out.  Of course the price of a coin is relevant to the success of Bitcoin.
There are things that flat out are impossible with a low-priced coin.  Take Zetacoin, with a current "market cap" of $770K.  It is impossible - not hard, but impossible - to store or transmit a million dollars of value using Zetacoin.  It cannot be done.
With a market cap of $5.8B, it is impossible to store or transmit $10B in value in Bitcoin.  Can't be done.  And it's impossible for 10000 people to store or transmit $1M in value in the same period.  It's impossible for a million people to hold $6000 worth of Bitcoins.
On the contrary, if a few hundred million people decided to have "spare change" of $100 stored in Bitcoin for online spending, then it's impossible for the price to be less than $1400.  not "hard" - it's impossible.  Three hundred million people cannot be holding onto $100 worth of value in Bitcoins unless the price is above $1400.

Adding to answer:
The benefits are that Side Chain alt-coins are different representations of Bitcoins that can have different characteristics which can encourage new creative inventions or parameter tweaks.
They take advantage of the strength of Bitcoin (the security of the mining network), but allow for experimentation and expansion with little risk to the main network.
It's sort of like Bitcoin being the vault of gold and everything else being pegged to it.  A 1000 Bollar bill (sic) is worth an ounce of gold, and can only come into existence by locking up the ounce of gold.  And you can only have your gold back by proving ownership (and destruction) of the Bollar Bill.

This allows many application specific chains to emerge without clogging up the main blockchain. 
This also potentially puts a curb on crypto-inflation, which is an evil that was brought on by the alts.  It allows alts to benefit from the strength of Bitcoin, and strengthens Bitcoin by reducing competition and crypto-inflation.

I'll try to answer this, but I'm sure others can elaborate.
First, web wallets.  In general, you are trusting someone else with your keys, which means there's a risk of them going out of business, or getting robbed.  See Mt. Gox for an example.  There are several types:
Most just hold your funds, and create transactions as needed.  Coinbase is an example.  They will perform off-blockchain transactions when they can.
Another type of web wallet is blockchain.info.  Their model is unique in that they supposedly don't hold your keys, so they supposedly can't be robbed as easily.  All the signing is done in-browser.  So if you maintain a safe, clean PC environment, and they aren't lying, then you are more in control of your Bitcoins.
Another type is green address, which has multi-sig.  Multi-sig will probably come to the first two.
OK, now to answer your question about PC wallets.
Armory is best thought of as an add-on to core.  So you still need the full blockchain.  Very good security.  You can have an off-line armory machine to really protect your bitcoins.
Electrum and Multibit are lighter clients.  No need for the whole blockchain.  These are very user friendly wallets for a PC, especially because you don't have to wait for the full blockchain download.  Why one over the other?  I've used both, and they are both excellent and seem to be secure.
For Android, there are several.  The Schildbach wallet (bitcoin wallet) is the grandaddy.  It's proven.  Mycelium is a really nice one that seems to be much more feature rich.  There are some issues (privacy concerns with always reusing the same deposit address, for example), but it's my mobile wallet of choice.

Having done work at quite a few financial institutions, I can tell you that in my experience linux (and unix variants) are, by far, the favored operating system for their core processing, not Windows.  And this bug affects linux.
So, your statement is wrong in a lot of ways.  "That's why"... are you saying that vulnerabilities are why banks choose windows?  They choose their products for the most cost-effective, robust, secure solution.  **That** is why they use a certain system.

There are about 2^160 Bitcoin Addresses possible. Private keys are 256 bits long, so each Bitcoin Address has, on average, about 2^96 possible private keys.

Collisions are possible but extremely unlikely.  More likely than finding a random collision would be to try to find a non-random collision, and thieves do this all the time.

In this example, I take a 6% interest rate, and show how it grows after 2 days, 4 days, and n days.  Paste this into A1 through B9 of your spreadsheet.    Note that at a 6% interest rate, for 183.5 pairs of days (365 days in a year), the principle of $100 becomes $106.
    6%	                        interest rate    
    0.01596535874528460%	daily interest rate

    100.0319333	                after 2 days
    100.0638767	                after 4 days
    	
    182.5	                        n
    106	                        after n pairs of days
Here are the formulas:
A1:  6%      
A2: =(1+A1)\^(1/365)-1     
A3: =(1+A2)\^2-1      
A4: 100

A8: 182.5     
A9: =A4\*(1+A3)\^A8      &lt;-- what you are looking for
Obviously this can be simplified if you aren't looking for pairs of days. You can combine it all into one formula to put the principle, interest, and n into one formula.

Bitcoin Addresses use Base-58 (basically all of the letters in upper and lower case, and all the digits, with a few left out that would cause confusion, like 0).  The smallest digit is a "1", which represents zero in Base-58.

I'm not really trying to argue for the rights of miners to keep the fees... don't get me wrong.  I'm trying to point out that it's a complicated issue, especially where it crosses into people making morality decisions on your behalf.  Which is why I keep coming back to "I hope it's in the agreement" because that addresses the issues.
My whole point... plain and simple, is that it's important for the agreement to cover the issue.
The reason is this:  For all the reasons people love Bitcoin and hate Paypal... Paypal makes arbitrary issues to stiff people.  Bitcoin removes that option.  Example:  If someone "accidentally" paypals you too much money, Paypal can decide to take that away from you, and impose their moral or legal judgment upon you.  Suddenly, the "intent" becomes a part of the equation with an arbitrator.  ("clearly that was an accident!") 
Where do you draw the line?  If he claimed to "accidentally" send .01 BTC as a fee, is that a clear accident?  What about .001?  Why is there an arbitrator involved, who can take money away from the miners and reissue it to the sender?  It just seems like a  bad precedent, unless rules are established (which is why I keep coming back, over and over, to the agreement).

Miners can affect the price of bitcoin by selling mined bitcoins.
If the current price to buy is cheaper than the price to mine, I can turn off my miner and buy bitcoin.
If the current price to buy (sell) is far over the price to mine, i can mine and sell.
These two mechanisms *can* affect the market price, pushing it toward the cost of mining, although I contend that the effect isn't great enough to overcome market irrationality.

These competitive services included email (which was not compatible with  SMTP), chat (which was not  based on RFC 1459- the internet relay chat protocol), and information retrieval (which was not compatible with the internet protocols for information retrieval).
It wasn't until '92 that they built a gateway, and much later that they moved to a fully internet-based service.

Thanks for the reply.  I get your perspective ... not sure I agree with it all, but that makes sense.
Personally, I think that the reason Bitcoin is so volatile is because it's a small market which is trying to extrapolate what the end game looks like, when it's a big market (i.e. how widespread can it get, and how soon), and so you get a bit of a whip effect.  
When the "how widespread can it get" part gets resolved with more certainty, the market will likely be bigger, with a smaller upside, and so I'd expect the volatility to be less.
I don't see much intrinsic value in a dollar (i.e. it represents a VERY small portion of the US Production), aside from its very marginal benefit of its utility as a currency, either.  So I don't think that's it.

It's not clear to me what the various greens and various reds mean.  Is that a brighter color for a bigger number?  different exchanges get different colors? Bigger volume?
Seems odd that the positives and negatives can cancel each other out at a particular price point.  So a very high volume time period could end up with a black "0" if it just happened that there were a lot bought at market at that price, and a lot sold at market at that price.
I'd like to see it be adjustable in multiple ways: time period (currently only one hour blocks.   How about smaller and bigger increments?).  Also currently set for $1 increments, and it might be nice to be able to adjust that upward or downward.

You don't need to deselect the default "use change addresses".  By leaving the default, when you make a payment, your change is returned to you at a different address (which is a good thing), and that address is maintained by your electrum wallet.   You can even see it in the wallet.
If you deselect the default, then the change is returned to you in the sending address.   This is OK, but not great for privacy.
Electrum works fine as a wallet, maintaining multiple addresses, including your change address.
Your concern about donating to miners is not warranted.  The people who did that probably created the transaction by hand, which you are not doing.
The other mistake that people make is that they don't realize that their change address is a separate address.  Electrum manages all of the addresses for you, so this is not an issue.  But the issue comes up when someone takes a paper wallet (which is ONE address), imports it into Electrum, and pays a little bit, thinking that the change is returned to that same address.  Then they DELETE THEIR ELECTRUM WALLET.  The mistake is in deleting their wallet!  
If you plan to delete ANYTHING (any private keys), make sure you know exactly where your coins are.  Blockchain.info can help you see exactly where they are (as can electrum's great interface).
The mistake, above, is that the user ASSUMES that the bitcoins are still on the Paper Wallet, when they do the delete.  Which would be true (probably) if they unchecked the default behavior, but this is still poor form, as you should drain an address completely when you spend from it.  There are several reasons, but one is that the public key is revealed with the spending, so your coins are significantly less secure, although still very secure.  Another is that miners are discouraging second transactions that spend from an address.
The correct way to put them back onto a paper wallet would be to PAY a NEW paper wallet with your balance.
Normal usage of Electrum should be no problem.  But if you are nervous, experiment with small amounts until you can see how it all works.

Can you help me understand the procedure here?  I am guessing that the merchant uses coinbase app or the bitcon app, and keys in a price, and then the app uses the NFC on the device to deliver to the payer an address to pay to, or a payment protocol URL.  Am I getting that right?
So then the payer taps the phone to the merchant's NFC, and then it initiates the transaction, just as if a QR code was scanned.  Sound right?
This would imply a dynamic NFC setup - different NFC data for each transaction.  The thing I struggle with is a static NFC setup.  For instance, people have talked about an NFC ring or bracelet being helpful for Bitcoin.  I can't see how that helps Bitcoin, except to give people the same "pay-to" address every time.  That appears to be what you are doing, with your Square mod, eh?

USB devices go bad.  So Gox may have had a policy of replacing the USB devices every 3 months.  (who knows!)
Once you replace the copy with a "known good" copy (which ended up being bad), you might destroy the old ones physically.
Basically, this theory points out the need for verified backups of wallet files.  Now, making a copy of your wallet.dat isn't good enough.  And it's not good enough to "verify the copy" by comparing it to the original.  The correct step is to "verify the copy" by testing the contents, the private keys, and verify that they are what you think they are.

There is no hard evidence here.
I can name tons of reasons why your assumptions can be incorrect.   Off the top of my head:
Assumption:  


-  Maybe the private keys were on a server, and the thief stole them, and corrupted them long ago.
-  Maybe the thief didn't want to call attention to the theft.
-  Maybe the thief was waiting to be discovered before he moved the coins.
-  Maybe the thief wasn't sure if he wanted to pull the trigger, and risk jail time.  So he waited 2 years before moving the funds.
-  Maybe the private key required a pass phrase, and the thieves corrupted the algorithm two years ago, while they tried to hack the pass phrase.  And they just hacked it.
-  Maybe it was stolen by an insider besides Karpeles.
yeah, there's no "hard evidence" here.  I think you mean "hardly evidence".

This assumes that you have a fixed amount of investment capital.  Many working people, however, have a growing amount of investment capital, in which case, DCA is the optimum investment strategy.  
For example, if you are willing to put 5% of your investment capital into high risk bitcoin investments, you might add a fixed amount every payday.  And when you get a raise, that amount might bump up a little.

On the other hand, if he detected the massive loss of Bitcoins back in July, he could have suspended and slowed fiat withdrawals in an attempt to create a price disparity compared to other exchanges, and then bought BTC on other exchanges. 
He could have been doing this for months, trying to re-coup the lost BTC.  But people were fleeing Gox during that period, so he would have had to do that at such a level so as to generate enough BTC to cover withdrawals AND to try to increase his reserves.  And that would have been extremely difficult without dramatically affecting the price.
At some point, he'd need to shut off BTC withdrawals, just to try to catch up.
I suspect he didn't know of the loss until days before the complete shutdown of the BTC withdrawals though.
Hindsight learning:  Once you get reports of fiat or Bitcoins not flowing smoothly out of an exchange, you need to get the hell out of there.  I feel for anybody who left their money there, or worse, who transferred money there after July!  (Then again, the people who transferred coins to Gox after July probably did it out of greed rather than ignorance, because they could sell for a better price, so maybe empathy isn't deserved.)

I'd tier the savings into separate bitcoin addresses.  For example, 188 Bitcoins can be stored in separate addresses, in the amounts of:
1, 2, 5  
10, 20, 50  
Then I'd do what 99% of the people would recommend against:  create the bitcoin addresses using the SHA256 of a 100+ character phrase made up of personal information that my heirs could figure out if they had to, by coming together.  That's right, a series of brain wallets.
A simple, one-page description of the algorithm could be stored in multiple places.  It might look like this:
"My stash of bitcoins are stored in a series of brain wallets.  The brain wallet can be calculated by answering the following ten questions precisely.  1)  My social security number (9 digits) 2) my first street address  (in 1996, no abbreviations, capitalize correctly, 20 characters), 3) These eight special characters % 4) My best friend's last name from 1st through 6th grade (7 characters, capitalize the first letter)... etc.... up to 100+ characters"  Append to that the denomination that you are looking for, in the format of xxxBTC, such as 050BTC.   Choose XXX from the list of [001,002,005,010,020,050,100].  Then execute SHA256 on that 106 character string (bitaddress.org will do this for you), and you will have my private key.
Then store that document in several places.  Bonus points if you can easily commit to memory your algorithm.

One of the factors that I like to use in modeling is "pocket change".  If a lot of people just want to generally carry $100 worth of bitcoins on their phones or PC's, to be able to do ad hoc electronic purchases, it adds up.

I'll prepare for the downvotes, but I'm going to (again) take a "benefit of the doubt" approach.  He made that video on July 17th, seven months ago.
On the leaked documents, the balance sheet showed almost 19% reserves.  If one thief took **0.003 BTC** on July 17th, and withdrew it, and complained that he didn't get it, and doubled up to 0.006 BTC, and put them all into Gox, and repeated that again the next week.  And kept doubling up, and repeating it each week.  By now, they'd have stolen more than 744,000 BTC.  **One thief, 0.003 BTC.**
Maybe he shouldn't have said what he said.  But you can't look at a 7-month old video, and say he's wrong now.  Hell, Roger was willing to buy GoxBTC for real BTC as recently as last week.  If he did that, he bailed out people, and lost money.

Bitcoin is different than credit cards, so you can't really compare it directly, but if you want to consider how long it takes for a payment to become irreversible, you need to consider that it takes a credit card payment about 90 days or longer for the merchant to be sure that he has the money.  
An expected value of ten minutes (not 5, as you said) looks really good compared to that.
Really, though, the level of irreversibility increases with time.  One confirmation is pretty secure.  Six is better (and considered by most people to be absolute).  144 (a full day) is even better.

Other theories of insolvency require either dishonesty (highly unlikely given past history), or Gox to have lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins that were stored in cold storage.  They also require total incompetence of developers - since other exchanges were back up in 0 hours to 48 hours, and Gox is down for much longer.
Both seems highly unlikely, and definitely not the simplest explanation.

Correlation does not equal causation.  Just because it's vulnerable to wild fluctuations (and everything is... I think the author means that it has wildly fluctuated recently), doesn't mean that this is DUE to the fact that it's not backed by some central bank.
In fact, these are contradictory statements in my mind.   It's not a "knock on Bitcoin" that it's not backed by some central bank - that's a FEATURE!
Volatility, well, that's greater than what I would prefer.  I would rather it be at a "stable" $100,000/BTC and growing 0.3% per year.  But I doubt we'll see that anytime soon.  And to get to high valuations, it needs to be unstable for the period of getting there.

People need to stop presenting this as a show-stopper.  Here's why:
Generally speaking, the larger the pool, the smaller the variance.  People like small variance, which is why many people choose a pool with greater than 20% of the hash power.
If we could get P2Pool to be the largest pool, then it will likely be competitive on all fronts:  low variance and best payouts.  But one of the challenges is that people need to run full nodes.  Some of us can't devote a machine to run a full node, but still want to help get P2Pool up in percentage and down in variance.
If P2Pool was 30+% of the network, then we can start looking at the issue you mention, as a secondary issue.  But even then, it's unlikely that any one full node has more than 5% of the network, and we're better off.
Right now, there are a lot of challenges to getting up and running on P2Pool.   Let's not add one more!

It is actually possible to generate hidden transactions and not release them to the network.  For example, you could create signed transactions that take your wealth and send half to each of your 2 children.  Then give those transactions offline to your 2 children, letting them know that if you are ever captured or dead, they can post the transactions and have access to your money.  
These transactions would be hidden until they are posted to the network, and could be invalidated by you prior to them executing the transactions.  It'd be a little convoluted, and there are better ways to do this, but that may be what you are referring to.
Give child "A" these transactions:    
Half of wealth to "A", with the change to "Change-B",   and   
"Change-A" to "A".
Give child "B" these transactions:   
Half of wealth to "B", with the change going to "Change-A", and   
"Change-B" to "B"
Child "A"  needs to know the private key for "A", and Child "B" knows "B".
Either kid can post their transactions at any time, independent of the other kid, and one of the 2 transactions for each kid will go through.
Convoluted....  but interesting, maybe.

Make sure you are using integers (fixed point decimal, as opposed to floating point) for all amounts, whether they be bitcoin balances or dollar balances.   You'll get all screwed up using floating point.
Keep your database on another server, not your web server.  Keep your private keys of your hot wallet on yet another server, not the web server or the database server.
As someone else said, use the open source to start with - it'll give you a MAJOR leg up on bug-free code.
The trading engine is critical to get right.  Make sure bids and asks are sequenced correctly and processed quickly.  Try to eliminate any chance of data integrity problems, while trying not to single-thread it.  Don't use an "almost correct" database (noSQL) like MongoDB.
You will want to get high volumes on the site quickly.  There are two ways to do that:  no fees, or maker/taker model.  Maker/taker is a better model for long-term success.  Basically, the taker pays the fees, and the maker makes money on the transaction.  That will reduce your bid/ask spread, and make it attractive.
Build an API up front.   You'll want an api to retrieve prices, and recent trades, market depth, and to place /cancel trades.  Probably best if you model it after existing apis, so you can be plug-compatible, for people to use you quickly with minimal change to their software.
Get DDOS protection up front.

This is correct.  That wasn't Mark.  And the total market cap of Bitcoin was $170K, at about a nickle per bitcoin.  And the total first week volume was about 5000 btc, or **$250.**

This really depends on the client that you are using.   
Bitcoin-QT has this concern.  If you restore an old backup, your more recent private keys won't be known, and your balance could drop.
There are now wallets that are deterministic, meaning once a random number is generated, the addresses follow a reproducible pattern.  So all you need to do is back up the original random number (or memorize it), and you are all set.  Electrum is a the model for this.
Of course, if you add your own private keys to Electrum, you mess up that concept (and you get a big warning).  But then you can just pay from that address to a "determined" address, and you are back in business.

Geez, I don't know how many times this misconception needs to be corrected.
[Here is the original New York criminal complaint]( from October of 2013.  As you can see, there are complaints enumerated as follows:
Count 1:  Narcotics Trafficking Conspiracy  
Count 2:  Computer Hacking Conspiracy  
Count 3:  Money Laundering Conspiracy  
And [here is the grand jury indictment](
Count 1:  Conspiracy to deliver, distribute, and dispense controlled substances   
Count 2:  Continuing Criminal Enterprise  
Count 3:  Computer Hacking Conspiracy  
Count 4:  Money Laundering Conspiracy  
There was never any criminal complaint about murder-for-hire in the New York district complaint, so **nothing was "dropped"**.  Murder-for-hire was mentioned in the narrative (as was buying narcotics, logging into the server, and numerous other things), but it was not a charge.

3 Pick a long time horizon now.  I recommend 7 months to 2 years.  Decide now that you aren't even going to consider selling it until some date in the future.    Many people buy in at the top, and then get jittery at the first pull-back.  It's a roller coaster that has generally headed up, but the hills can be gut-wrenching, so don't stare at the charts.
Consider putting them on to a paper wallet.  Coinbase has a paper wallet process (explained in their blog.  Google "coinbase paper wallet blog" and you'll find it.  The nice thing about a paper wallet is that it's inconvenient to sell at the first drop.  And it's probably safer.  And you can make 2 or 3 copies.

I think [this Yahoo Finance post, and accompanying video]( is completely in support of what you are saying. 
When the mass media is saying Bitcoin is over, that's a clear sign to buy.  Until they are right, they will essentially be marking the low points.  Nothing has fundamentally changed.
The IRS announcement is cited as some huge tragedy, but it was really nothing that wasn't anticipated.  If you had been following the conversation about tax, you would have already been tracking transactions, and thinking about capital gains.  There was really very little news in that clarification.  (But it's a HUGE software opportunity.)
Spend the next few days watching some of [the videos of last week's CoinSummit](  Those videos show how much sheer brainpower and investment is going into Bitcoin.  
If you've been through the bitcoin cycles before, you know that this "feels" right.  I feel like there's a base around maybe $440 that will be very hard to cross, and it's a good time to be adding a little investment here and there.  Don't wait for it to dip.  That base will be at $500 in less than a month (rising maybe 13% per month).
No one knows what will happen - certainly not me!  But I feel like this is definitely the calm before a very positive storm.

1.  Make a copy of the disk.

I disagree.   
First, a fair price is determined also by what someone is willing to pay.
Second, there's something to be said for being an expert in the field. If they went to their standard web developer and said "I want to accept Bitcoin", the standard web dev would likely take hours (of billable time) getting up to speed on "what is bitcoin, what's the best way to accept it, how do I train someone on this thing that I know nothing about."  They are getting paid for their expertise in addition to their time.
When the market is saturated, and the service is a commodity, then the price goes to a "cost" basis.
Third, there's marketing, selling, billing, the risk of having to spend a shitload of time dealing with the website (like maybe the client doesn't even know how to edit it, or you have to work with a 3rd party for credentials and access), and the risk of not getting paid.  I wouldn't touch a new, unknown, remote client for that little money.  It's not worth it.

The FUD that buttcoiners toss out there is that Bitcoin will fail because it costs $30+ per transaction to process. (implying that fees will need to approach $30/transaction for the system to work)
And the response is: Subsidy changes behavior, inviting higher cost participants. If the subsidy wasn't there, then the high cost participants wouldn't be there, and therefore the average cost would be lower.
This effect is similar to subsidies for farming and green energy companies.

I really don't know.  Probably depends on if Bitcoin ever becomes completely mainstream (I think it will) and when it gets replaced by something else (I think that will happen too, but it may be 200 years before that happens).
Personally, I think once it's an everyday thing, or at least as popular as gold, the price will have its final major gyration, and then be more normal (somewhat like gold) where there will be an occasional mini-bubble, but for the most part pretty well stabilized.  Maybe that's in 15 to 20 years.  So many more bubbles to come, in my opinion. (like 20).

I agree, you can't prove "no the same person".
However, if you had to declare your allegiance in order to benefit from pooling, then it seems like this could work.  
If you want to mine independently, then your payouts will have high variance.  If you want to mine in a pool, then you have to pick one.
The pool definition could be a binary tree, and incentives could be in place to try to keep it balanced.  Half the mining power is on pool "0" and half the mining power is on pool "1".  Of the miners on pool "1", half of those are on "10" and half are on 11".  Of the miners on "11", half are on "110" and half on "111".  You have to declare your position when you solve a block (include "pool number" somewhere in the block, so that it can't be faked.)
The difficulty necessary to claim that a block has been solved is adjusted based on your proof that you have been mining at that pool number for past losing blocks.  That is, if you can prove that you have mined at that pool number for the past month at a heavy hash power, without solving a block (as demonstrated by providing your best non-winning blocks), the difficulty that you need to solve a block is made simpler that someone who can't prove that they've historically provided hash power to the network.
You still can't prove "not the same person", but you can level the playing field much like P2Pool does.

I like [this Warren Buffett Quote]( even knowing that he is not an advocate of Bitcoin. 


The guys who "hit home runs" financially often are those who swing for the fences, and put all their eggs in one basket, to mix metaphors.   Far more fence-swingers strike out.  But the very few who succeed, can succeed big.
None of us know if Bitcoin is a good basket or a bad basket.  And watching that basket may mean watching it plummet to near-zero very rapidly and losing almost everything.
Financial security can be achieved (and probably best achieved) through diversification and just hitting for average.  I agree with you there.  
Those who have their financial security locked up, or those who have a long career ahead of them, may be able to afford to swing for the fences.
Personally, I believe that in three years, Bitcoin will be worth 4-digits.  But who the hell knows.  The most likely negative scenario in my mind is that it languishes in the $200 - 480 range for the rest of my life, and I die early.

The question, though, becomes whether by allowing slicing into smaller pieces, you "created more pizza", causing everyone who has slices to have a smaller proportion of the whole.
If you cut a pizza into eight even slices, and give me one, look at how different it is between then cutting each of the eight pizzas in half, versus pulling out another pizza from the oven and giving it to other people.  In both cases, I still have one eighth of a pizza.  But in the first case, I still have one eighth of the entire pizza supply.  In the second, you diluted my share so that I now only have one sixteenth of the supply.  
If pizza is in demand and being bid on, and I am trying to sell my piece of pizza, in the second case, it's half as valuable.

But think about how that works... they invest heavily in creating the machine, and sell some units to the public to recoup some of that development cost.  Then their marginal cost to make and mine is very small.  So they crank up the in-house mining, effectively making the equipment that they sold the public worth less.
I'm not saying it's unethical.  I'm saying that people will almost always over-pay for mining machines.

This is definitely a concept that messes with the brain.   Your rational mind says that something just doesn't feel right about burning coins, and so it comes up with reasons it's bad and competing ideas.
But you are 100% correct - if Bitcoin is truly infinitely divisible (by adjusting the number of decimal places), then burning coins is truly donating them to everyone else.  It's just hard for the rational brain to come to that conclusion on its own.

The cost-per-transaction seems to me to be self-regulating.  If miners want the fees, they have to process the transactions.  If they decide that the fees need to be more expensive, they can refuse to process small-fee transactions.  But then spenders can decide that it's not worth it to spend large fees.
So miners then have to decide whether they process small fees, or less transactions.  And if small or no fees causes them to be unprofitable due to energy costs, then they power off.  And that brings an equilibrium.  At that point, fees are competitive with the alternatives, and competitive to make it worthwhile to mine.
Where is the mistake in this logic?

OP may also succeed with some quick one-liners, like:

"Directly" means no middle-man (so checks, credit cards, paypal, instant payments through your bank, wires, etc., don't count!).  
Nearly Anyone - don't forget that the vast majority of humans on this planet don't have a bank, but many have internet access.  And don't forget the importance of freedom lovers to permit free flowing support for dissidents in oppressive regimes.
Nearly instantly -  the transaction is spread through the network in less than ten seconds, and is confirmed on average in ten minutes.  Virtually irreversible in an hour (which should be compared to credit cards which can be reversed 90 days later).
Nearly Free:  Compare to credit cards at 3%+, the transaction fee is miniscule.

I went digging for some mid-1990's articles that first got me interested in digital cash, and I came across [this one]( written by [Jon Matonis]( who is now the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation.  I remember reading it back in the day, and jotting down all those critical aspects of the ideal digital cash.
It's interesting to read what the prevailing thoughts of the day were.  Although this paper describes the features of Bitcoin nearly to a tee, it still talks about an agency that issues the currency.
It seems that Jon was about a decade off, from his prediction of how digital currency would be pervasive in 2005.
A good read, and a great flashback.  The most noteworthy thing, though, is that while Satoshi was the first to "bring it all together", you can see that these thoughts were being kicked around in the mid-nineties.  Not to minimize Satoshi's genius, but there were definitely many people working out the details of what the perfect Digital Cash would look like.

The part that is not true is the word "always".
I ran an analysis of all trading days, to see which days Bitcoin performed best on, and indeed, it has performed significantly better on days that the stock market is open.  (I was comparing it to the S&amp;P 500, and I had a bunch of extra days that Bitcoin traded, but the stock market wasn't open).
The average return on days that the stock market was closed (which were predominantly weekends) was just slightly over zero (so on average it has gone up), but very far off of the average of all days.

For online merchants, it eliminates chargeback fraud, which was the  reason why online businesses failed: more than 50% of failed online businesses reported that this was the cause of failure.
It is also much cheaper than credit cards.  It also enables unrestricted transactions (no governments, banks, credit cards or paypal can get in the way), which is great for any sort of controversial transactions (think about dissidents trying to buy a blog, or people trying to fund a fringe freedom-fighting organization).
It also potentially provides access to the 60-80% of the world's population who doesn't have a bank account (but does have access to a phone).
For users, it provides a way to transmit funds one time without revealing too much information.  (Every time you reveal your credit card info, you provide all the information necessary for someone to impersonate you.)

$210 Billion of a certain sort of asset (such as tax haven money) cannot be stored within a superset asset (such as Bitoin), unless that superset is worth at least the smaller amount.
Tell me some way that people could buy bitcoins for $210 B, that would only drive the total of all Bitcoins to be worth $10.1 B.  
I suppose you could argue that someone could foolishly buy one bitcoin for $210B, and then the exchange rate would immediately drop back down to current levels.  But for that instant that some person or people exchange their $210B for Bitcoins (no matter how many), the market cap will be at least $210B.

What's the longest streak of either heads or tails that you have in that string of 256 flips?   
If I said, "I am 90% confident you have a streak of at least x" in 256 flips, what is the right answer for x?  
A stats teacher assigned homework to record the results of a hundred coin flips.  Then, the next day, he had them pull out their work, and count the longest streak, and write that number down.  Then also anonymously write "Yes" if you did the assignment perfectly, or "No" if you "cheated" by not flipping the coin or recording the results exactly.  The papers were collected, and there was a perfect correlation between those that admitted cheating and had low values for "longest streak".

If we set a trigger at 1/year, and let everyone know that anytime the last 9 characters of the block hash come up less than 0x00013F338, that we'd have a bank run (or whatever), it turned out like this: the first time this occurred was [block 15152]( on 2009-05-20.  The second time was [block 57742]( on 2010-05-26.
It didn't happen again in the first 90,000 blocks (so by November 2010), but I am still looking....

definitely within the reach of a startup, but you need to know how to secure your machine(s).  It's not that hard, but you need talented individuals.
Of course it's all relative to how much you are storing online.  If you are on call to move money from cold storage as needed, you can keep a very small amount online.  And that determines your risk level.  If you are protecting 1 BTC, you secure it as best as you can, but don't spend 1000 BTC worth of effort and architecture to do it.  As you grow, you can add more security talent and layers.

(warning, Ameri-centric view ahead):
I was taught that the American Founding Fathers knew that no system of men could allow people to be free, unless a system of rules were in place to control what the men could and couldn't do.  
That set of rules, the math behind freedom, was recorded in a document called the Constitution.  It limited government.  It limited laws so that the majority could not trample on the minority.  It split the responsibility of rule enforcement among different groups of people to try to avoid corruption, through a series of checks and balances.
Unfortunately, men figured out how to bypass these rules, in the establishment and management of money.
Bitcoin brings us back to math and rules.  Rules that cannot be subverted by well-intentioned or greedy men who want to take control again.
The fight for freedom is long from being over.  Well-intentioned and greedy people will continue to attack.  So be vigilant.

Imagination is definitely required, but it's not so far fetched.
Here are some additional facts:
Gox has made a ton of money.  The charts say $14M + 26K BTC in the past six months alone in fees.  (facts based on bitcoincharts.com)  So where did it go?  Gox knows about cold storage.  They surely have some grasp of their relative financial position, to the point where they can say "90% is in cold storage".
Something smells fishy, in that there's no way they could or would lose their cold storage, especially to a bug.  That just isn't logical.  So they clearly have lost some access to some of their massive vaults of cash and bitcoins in cold storage, or they would be talking.  
There are only a few ways they've lost access:  1) an internal thief.  Seems far fetched.  Especially not Karpeles.  As much as I dislike the guy, I don't think he's dumb enough to shut down a cash cow like Gox by running off with the money NOW.  Maybe a year from now...?  But not now.  Maybe it was his right-hand man, but still seems far-fetched.
Or 2) they lost access to the keys somehow.  This, too, seems far fetched, unless they are physically being blocked.  And this could be done by governments and banks.  
I just can't believe they could be so incompetent to lose cold storage to thieves.  **That** to me requires too much imagination.
Still, I admit, I made up a story to try to fit the facts.

Exactly.  Entries with counts of 1 tell you an answer - like a Sudoku puzzle that only has one choice for that block.  Once you get that answer, you subtract it out of multiple places in the IBLT (once for each hashing algorithm), and then that will take some other counts down to 1, and allow you to solve more.
When all counts are 0, you are done.  If you get to a point where it's non-zero, and there are no 1-counts left, then you didn't have enough transactions to start with, and so you need more data.  Presumably then you could ask for the complete block, or at least some random transactions that you might be missing.  That's like asking your older sister for a hint on the Sudoku.

This seems somewhere between nit-picky and incorrect.  Maybe an attempt to be pedantic.  I think you are adding confusion by implying/saying that bitcoin addresses don't have balances.  (Sorry if I am misunderstanding your somewhat clumsy comment.)
If I look up a Bitcoin Address on, say, Blockchain.info, there it is, listed right on [the page]( ([cached, if it's down]( "Final Balance".
Now Blockchain.info could be using incorrect terminology, so let's go to the Complete Writings of Satoshi, who used the term "balance" 33 times on bitcointalk.org.  
On 5/26/2010, he [wrote]( about the function listreceivedbyaddress, which he mentions that you could show the "available balance", which sure implies that an address has a balance.

Depending on your skills, you could write a simple formula in Excel or Python, that takes the answers to 10 questions that only you and your family know.  So you can have an Excel spreadsheet with all your instructions, in the event of your demise:
Cell A1 has the formula to take the ten answers (from A2-A11) and massage them, concatenate them, manipulate them (change the case, for instance, of various letters), and intermix some constants in there, with punctuation.  Cell B2-B11 can have the prompts, like "Write my social security number in cell A2, including the dashes".  The formula in cell A1 might take the contents of A2 and change the dashes to dollar signs, add 1 to one of the digits, and append a constant, like "z  Then it appends this answer to all the other manipulated answers.
The result, you end up with some 100+ character string in cell A1 that can be reproduced only by someone with the spreadsheet and the knowledge.  Plug A1 into a brainwallet program (to hash it), and you have a unique storage address, protected with 2-factor (what they have and what they know), for your family's enjoyment when you are dead.

This is pretty humorous to me.  People complain that they don't hold BTC.  And as you subtly point out, they spend their dollars on their supply chain (labor, office space, equipment, bandwidth).
So the old system was:
**Dollars donated  -&gt;  converted to labor, office space, equipment, bandwidth.**
Now with Bitcoin:
**Bitcoin donated -&gt;  converted to dollars -&gt; converted to labor, office space, equipment, bandwidth.**
In neither case are they holding the currency.  So the whole rant about "just another vendor applying downward pressure on the price" is ridiculous.
Even if donations greatly exceed costs, it's likely that they are not "holding" that in dollars, but instead converting it to investments such as stocks in companies.

@_date: 2014-08-11 16:00:38
Yes!  The way this would work is as follows:
First, you check all of the transactions that you know about.  You can usually easily see whether they are "in" or "out" of the solved block.  There are three things that can happen when you are checking a specific transaction against the IBLT.   
1)  One of the hash functions shows a "zero" (e.g. in my example, "0 have a remainder of x").. like if you checked for the number "8", you would see that "0 have a remainder of 1, when dividing by 7", you know that you can rule that transaction OUT.  "8" is NOT included in the block.
2)  All of the hash functions show a number greater than 1, in which case you have no information (yet).  You can re-check after you have found some that meet criteria    It might be in, or it might be out.
3)  All of the hash functions show non-zero counts, and at least one of the hash functions shows a number of "1", like when you check for 42.  In this case, you know that the transaction is "IN" the batch, and you include it.  
In case  you also "Delete" the transaction from a copy of the IBLT, thus reducing the counts by 1, and also reducing the "total" for that index by the value of the transaction.
So the full IBLT table really has an entry like this:
    if you divide by 19:  
    2 have a remainder of 4 **and their total is 65**
And when you delete "42" from the copy of the table, you are left with 
    if you divide by 19:  
    1 has a remainder of 4 **and its total is 23**
By deleting the known transactions from the IBLT, you will be left with a reduced copy of the IBLT that contains your unknown transactions, entirely.
\* IBLTs typically use XOR, not totals, but this conveys the idea sufficiently.

Interesting thought.  But Karpeles has said he plans to pay bitcoin holders back in bitcoin.
Maybe as part of his restructuring efforts, he'll make offers to each user for each part of their holding:
"For all the dollars you have on account, we have $400K of the $500K we owe people [or whatever the numbers are], and so you can have 4/5ths of your deposit, as long as you a) forgive me of the other 1/5th, and b) keep it in Mt. Gox for 1 year.  Other options are to wait until we earn all of your deposit back, and then withdraw (risking that you might never get anything)."

I tend to think so too.   The minor adjustment I would make is that as bitcoin adoption inevitably slows down, at the leveling off of the S-curve (adoption curve), people will be expecting the pattern of price that they have seen in the past.  So not quite at full market saturation, but more like at the inflection point of the S.
At that point, you have a repeated history of market psychology pushing the price up.  And a lack of new money coming in.  And then I think it'll crash pretty hard.
Now, I think those crashed prices will still be well above where we are today.  But Bitcoin might stabilize quite a bit before that, and then all of the sudden, a 50% or 75% correction, like we haven't seen for a decade.  (Yes, all this will happen after 2020, in my prediction.)

I think there are two separate things that caused apple-hate.
1)  Apple's stance on certain things.
2)  A significant number of early Apple users being pretentious douches. Or put another way, in my experience, nearly 100% of pretentious douches were quick to jump on the apple bandwagon.  
That's not to say that all apple users are pretentious douches, but it's significant enough to be noticeable.

A nationwide survey at that.  So 2%, 6.3M people in the US, own Bitcoins.
Assuming that half the people who own bitcoins are in the US (a wild assumption, purely for convenience), that puts us as about 12M bitcoins spread over about 12M people.
So on average, people who own some bitcoins own about 1 BTC.

His goal with these announcements is to maximize fees, which are made up of volume times price.  That's the only way he can return people's money, is to generate a lot of fees so he can re- fund his customer's accounts.  And it's a tricky game because he has to re-fund them in both BTC and dollars, so he has to pick the message that provides commissions to bolster both of those things.
So they are cleverly worded to generate high volume.  The price suffers a little (or a lot), but the volume rockets up.
With high volumes and low prices, more bitcoins are being traded per thousand dollars.  Therefore more bitcoin reserves are being built up, due to fees generated.
Yeah, this stupid conspiracy theory is starting to make more sense.. I might even believe it myself!

The old way that BitPay worked was this:  Say you wanted to buy something from TigerDirect (which uses BitPay).  You shop for it, you check out, and a BitPay address is displayed.  You then click it or scan it (depending on if you are paying from a client on that PC or from your phone).  You then authorize the payment in your wallet software.
The transaction is sent from your wallet to the nodes(s) that the wallet is connected to, eventually spreading throughout the Bitcoin network, and ultimately heard by BitPay, so you get credit for paying.
In the new system, the information as to who you are paying (BitPay) is also provided to you via the QR code or link.  So when you pay, the payment is sent directly to BitPay (presumably via IP address... that's my guess).  Then BitPay can forward it to the Bitcoin Network.
The advantages of the new method are:  BitPay knows you paid a lot faster (like up to 10 seconds faster), and BitPay can process the transaction in a way they want (like add a fee to ensure that it gets in a block faster, and isn't double-spent).

And the wallet does that for you.   The private key and the Bitcoin Address have a certain mathematical relationship, so that if you have the private key, software can easily determine the bitcoin address.  But it's virtually impossible to go the other way.  
So your private key is super-secret, and it's your "proof of ownership" of the coins.
The cool thing is that when you spend the bitcoins, you don't need to "reveal" your private key.  Your wallet software simply "uses" the private key to sign the transaction, proving that you have the key without revealing it.

If I want to buy something from one of my other devices, I need to either key in some 34 character Bitcoin address, or scan a QR code.  QR codes are fabulous for that.

Given that Two Bit Idiot says that [the evidence is in plain site]( is it possible that the initial contributions to the Bitcoin Foundation can be traced on the Block Chain to some incriminating spot (like Mt. Gox's stash that's on the move right now)?
Maybe start with [the donation address]( listed on their [donate page]( and trace some coins from the donation address (5094+ BTC), over to [here](  You can see that some of the 5094+ BTC got sent and received by [this address]( which had 12,500+ BTC pass through it.
Seems pretty obvious that this last address is a Bitcoin Foundation address, with the way the coins were mixed ([same address appear in both the inputs and outputs, here]( so the question is...  did the 12,500+ BTC help to fund a Gox bailout?
[This transaction]( moves 500 BTC  on March 19, 2013, from the 12,500, and starts getting distributed downward (just like an exchange's hot wallet would do, I imagine.  First 5 BTC, then 33 BTC, then 400 BTC, in even amounts, which you might see as exchange withdrawals.
Bottom line, there are some trails out there that people can follow.  I can't say for sure if this trail that I have found amounts to anything, but it sure looks suspicious (and this is just the first trail I followed.  You can follow many trails from the 12,500+ BTC address, and see where they lead.)
The links above appear to show money that went from the donation address of the Bitcoin Foundation, to an address that is controlled by the Bitcoin Foundation, to another address controlled by them, to an address follows an exchange's pattern of distribution.  
Unknowns:  Was it Gox?  Did they simply deposit to Gox, and we see the money distribute to people who withdrew?  Or was it something more sinister?
Let the rumors begin!

All three books are in my nearest bookshelf, and referred to often.  So I am familiar.
Nowhere in those books, as far as I know, is it mentioned to share salaries.  Instead, it recommends sharing the financials at a detail level that is understandable.

If you are a history buff, and a believer that you can predict based on the past, you might look at the bottom being a multiple of the previous top.  So it hit 32, pulled back, then hit 262 or so, pulled back to what, 50?
So, 50 is to 32 as X is to 262.  That would put the bottom at about 409.  (Check my math and my history... I am guessing)

I can restart them, and they run for a while (hours or days), and then fail again.  Not sure what is going on, but I have been slower and slower to notice the failure and to restart them.

Whether this is causing lots of issues for lots of people, or just 3 for me, I don't know.  But it might help to alert or or or some of the other devs, so they can investigate whether something is kicking nodes off (like a bug, perhaps triggered by traffic from nefarious actors or a virus).

I disagree with this statement.  AOL took a strategy of trying to be better than the internet for many years, as a private "walled garden" (sound familiar?).  They had Keywords (instead of domain names), and user names for email addresses (*not*

Bitcoin can easily be bought instantly with irreversible funds.
Hand someone cash (localbitcoins, Bitcoin ATM, Local Trader).  
Want to do it online?  Transfer irreversible funds.  This usually means another crypto-currency, since you can't irreversibly transfer cash over the internet.

It was relatively simple to bid with Barry (assuming you had $25,000, or whatever Barry's minimum was).  And if you were only buying a small amount, like $25,000 worth, you can pretty much buy that at market.  So why bid above market?

If you buy at $100+1%, your basis is $101.

This developer guide section is very helpful.  
But it is slightly inconsistent with BIP-32.  The issue is whether 2^31 represents the first hardened index or the last non-hardened index.   In BIP-32, 2^31 represents the first hardened index (so the leading bit acts as sort of a flag as to whether hardened indexes are being used).  I believe the Developer Guide has this wrong.

OK discussion-meta here:
Your original assertion was that bitcoin has an issue because you can lose money holding it.  My counter-argument was that you can also gain money holding it, so that isn't inherently bad.   In fact, that's how *all* currencies work.
Your new assertion is that bitcoin's problem is volatility and that volatility will get worse as a closed-loop system.  You have presented this assertion without any evidence backing your second assertion (that volatility will get worse, as the loop becomes more closed), despite quite a bit of evidence to the contrary.
I agree that increased volatility would be problematic, but I don't agree that a closed-loop system produces more volatility.  I would like to understand your evidence to that claim, as almost all evidence I have seen (including nearly every currency that has ever existed in the history of mankind) demonstrates the opposite.

A bitcoin is a "unit of account".  It's not a thing like a coin.  It's an amount.  Like an inch or an ounce.
Bitcoin Addresses can have account balances, expressed in bitcoins.  They can be 0, fractional amounts (like 0.00000001 BTC, or 1.5 BTC), or whole numbers (like 1 BTC, 10 BTC).
You can't really point at a bitcoin, much like you can't point an ounce.  You can point at an ounce *of something*, like you can point at an address associated with a certain amount of bitcoins.
Addresses are kinda sorta like bank accounts, with balances.

The obvious counter argument is to question why bitcoin is catching on if no one is compelled to use it (i.e. there must be an attraction, then, if no one is forced to use it, and it's growth in "market acceptance" is exponential.).  
Euros caught on somewhat quickly because people were compelled to use Euros by threat of force.  Bitcoins are catching on without the threat.  Therefore there must be something to it.

I am not quite sure what words you read that launched you into that rant, but I never said that profit making is a problem, or that people should innovate for free.
Side chains offer the chance to innovate with the benefit of the security of the Bitcoin mining network.  The current generation of alts contain a substantial number of significantly weaker networks, and create crypto-inflation.  Many of the alt-coins are just pump-and-dump with zero innovation.  (Some even claim that having a nice sub-reddit is an innovation!  "Our pumpers are nicer than the other guys.")
It will be possible (and fairly trivial, according to the currently available sidechain information) to create a side chain that rewards the innovator *and* benefits from the strength of the bitcoin mining network, which would then cause people to wonder why they should believe the sales pitch of alt-du-jour which is not backed by the strength of the main block chain.
Currently there are bitcoin companies that tie up your money for days (like Coinbase) that do pretty well.  And it's pretty common in traditional investments (try getting dollars for your GE stock that's held in their stock ownership plan, for instance).  It's not a show-stopper.

I'm trying to understand the thoughts of a mad man.  I think he is saying that while bitcoins are tokens of value in themselves, they can represent other things of bigger value (colored coins?), and so the whole notion that Bitcoins will gain in value is mistaken because representation can be abstract."
Basically, nickle and zinc and copper and paper have value themselves, but if we write on them that that they are worth 5 cents, 25 cents, a dollar, or 100 dollars, you don't need to be exchanging the "real" amount of value; you can be exchanging a simulated amount.
But what he overlooks is that the use of bitcoins (or nickle, zinc, copper, etc) within exchange increases the demand for the underlying commodity, which raises the underlying market price.
I think he's trying to say that a $7B Bitcoin market cap can support $700B or $7T in exchange, simply by making each bitcoin represent more.  OK.  But then usage of Bitcoin will raise demand for Bitcoin, which will raise the $7B market cap.
It's a mixed up argument that he's either incapable of seeing the flaws in it, or incapable of explaining clearly what the hell he's talking about.
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:21:00
There are several systems of escrow available.  Some require you to put the bitcoins into escrow, and they can only be released if 2 parties agree.  So there are 3 parties:  the customer, the vendor, and the escrow agency.  The escrow agency doesn't get involved unless there's a dispute.
2 parties out of the 3 can release the money to either the customer or the vendor.
So if the transaction goes smoothly, the customer and vendor agree, and release the funds.  No involvement of the escrow.
If there's a dispute, then both parties present their "facts" to the escrow agency, who makes a decision as to who to release the coins to.

As other answers indicate, there are light wallets, where you don't need to download the blockchain.
But with QT, you'd need to download the whole blockchain, because it not only has to see if you got the bitcoins in the first place (i.e. old blocks), but also whether you have spent them since (i.e. newer blocks).

A story I have told many times in my days consulting is that Dell (supposedly) had a completely manual system behind the scenes when they went live.

**TL; DR and TL;DW: It demonstrated a primitive version of an app that allows you to link your PC wallet to your phone, and create a shared address that requires both devices to approve spending from that address.**
More detail:
Actually, the app isn't all that primitive.  The app looks good (still rough edges), but also requires wallet providers to integrate.
The full demo was:
1.  He started a wallet program on his PC (this could be any wallet program that integrates with his app, but there aren't any yet).
2.  He presses a button on the wallet program to indicate that he wants to pair with a mobile phone.  A QR code is displayed.
3.  He scans the QR code  with his Android phone (this communicates the IP address of the PC, and some other info).  This pairs the devices.
4.  He generates a shared address on his PC wallet (again... this software could be any PC wallet, but none is integrated yet, so he uses a simulated one that he wrote).  This address starts with a "3", and is a multi-sig wallet.
5.  He sends money to that multi-sig address from Electrum, using standard mechanisms.  Nothing new here.
6.  He sends money FROM the multi-sig address to another address, to demonstrate multi-sig.  He sends it from the "simulated" PC wallet (since none is integrated with his app yet).
7.  His phone receives an alert that verification is needed.  It tells the amount and the destination address.  He OK's it from his phone.
8. The bitcoins are sent.
**The reason this is significant is because he has developed a PROTOCOL and an APP that do multi-sig.  If wallet manufacturers like it, they will integrate.  This removes the need for a 3rd party that does multi-sig, and allows you to control and protect your bitcoins using 2 devices on your own.**

Not easily.  The analogy I use is fiat.  Couldn't someone simply create $3 bills with their laser printer?  Sure, they could do that, but the challenge is convincing the rest of the world that those fake $3 bills are worth something. 
You could create a client that creates and recognizes fake bitcoins beyond the 21 Million, but if no one else believes you, well then you really haven't been successful.  If you can get one other person to believe you, maybe you can fool them.  But unless you get the majority of significant people to believe you, you have failed.
Most people say that you need a majority - 50+%.  I contend that if you got bitpay, coinbase, and one exchange to install your client, you could probably convert your "fake" coins into something more real.

This is a little different, but last year at this time, you could buy Bitcoin at Walmart or CVS.  Not exactly the process you are talking about, because you got to specify your own receiving Bitcoin address.
I did this many times (it doesn't work now though):  Go to bitinstant.com, fill out a form online, including your email address and your destination Bitcoin address, and how much you are buying.
BitInstant told you how much cash to bring to Walmart, and who to send it to, via Walmart's "Send Money" customer service area.  By the time I got home, I had my bitcoins, in my wallet, at my preferred address.

Let's say you just wanted to un-do the most recent block.  With 10% mining power, you need to come out with 2 blocks before anyone comes out with the next block.   So you have about a 1% chance of doing that, and forking the chain.
That's not really all that unlikely.  I mean, I wouldn't build a business around it, but it's certainly better than a lottery ticket.
OK, let's un-do 2 blocks.  So we need to get 3 blocks before the next one is solved.  So we have about a 1 in 1000 chance of that.  Still possible.
Now, if you try to un-do the whole blockchain, then it gets ugly.
The only real error in my post and in the 51% post is that you really can't un-do back further than the last checkpoint hard-coded into the code.
Edit:  as I think about it... it's no sure thing that you could undo any block length eventually...  but possible.

Actually, the more I think about this, the more I think that $1B under management might happen quicker than most people think.  (Still, 3 days would be a fantasy!)
The reason is the relative lack of liquidity of the Bitcoin market.  It's very well possible that an ETF opens the flood gates, and rapid purchases gobble up the liquidity to the point that a relatively small number ($100M?) goes into the fund, but temporarily pushes the price of bitcoin to 10x the "current" level at that time.  Or maybe $500M and the spot price doubles.  
My point is that it doesn't take $1B to drive the value of the assets under management to $1B.

Attempted ELI5 for Currently, miners have an incentive to mine small numbers of transactions, because the quicker you can tell many people your solution to the block-mining problem, the more likely you are to keep your reward.
Picture a whisper game among 100 5-year olds standing in a circle.  You and Billy, who is next to you, whisper different messages to the people next to you - you whisper the word "Bitcoin" to the person to your right, while Billy recites the Preamble to the Declaration of Independence to the person to his left.  The two messages transmit around the circle until everyone has one of the two messages.    So which message is more prevalent?  The shorter one.  So Bitcoin miners *currently* have incentive to pass short messages, which means small blocks, which means few transactions.
This proposal says that we can produce software that removes the incentive to create and solve small blocks.  We fix the size of the message that you whisper to your neighbor, so that no matter how many transactions you include, it's always the same size.
The way this is achieved is that we rely on the fact that your neighbor *probably* knows much of the content.  They generally know what transactions were possibly included in the block (or at least they know almost all of the transactions that you might have chosen to include).
So rather than repeating all of the transactional data, you send a fixed block of information (the IBLT) that can be used to recreate the solved block.
The really cool thing about IBLTs is that they can be very space efficient.  Rather than sending each transaction in its entirety, you overlap them in an almost random (predictable, though) fashion.
To give a quick demonstration of IBLTs, suppose I'm trying to communicate to you a set of numbers, and, for sake of simplicity, let's say you're pretty confident that many of them were chosen from the numbers from 1-100.
I can tell you something like this:
    if you divide by 7:  
    1 has a remainder of 0  
    2 have a remainder of 2  
    1 has a remainder of 3  
    1 has a remainder of 5.
    if you divide by 19:  
    2 have a remainder of 4  
    1 has a remainder of 5  
    1 has a remainder of 12  
    1 has a remainder of 16
I can run through my list of numbers from 1 to 100, and see exactly which numbers were included.  There's only one sequence of numbers that fits that criteria, (assuming my example is sound).  Edit:  there's another potential solution to this, as someone points out below.  But I'll leave it unchanged, since I was aiming for simplicity.
Further, if I only know about 90% of the  choices that you might have chosen from (say I only know of 90 of the 100 numbers from 1-100), I can test those 90 numbers, and see which ones meet the criteria, and I am left with enough information to solve for the remaining numbers.
And although my simplified example just contained small numbers, this numeric data can contain the entire transaction, not just the transaction id.  So, once you test the transactions that you know about, you are left with enough information to reconstruct the transactions that you do not know about.
Now, the sequence of numbers that solves the above problem is [12, 16, 23, 24, 42],  Assuming that my math is OK.  It's important to have a "canonical order" - which means a default order - so that you reconstruct the block in the same order that I created the block, so that you can confirm that the block is worthy of the coveted 25 BTC block reward.  (The hashing of [12, 16, 23, 24, 42] will be different than the hashing of [16, 23, 12, 24, 42], even though it's the same set of transactions.)  In the above list, I sequenced the numbers in ascending order, as the canonical order.
Note that if I included 30 numbers or 99 numbers, not 5, the size of my content (the remainders when divided by 7 and 19) still is the same size (that is, if I hadn't simplified my example by leaving off the "zero entries", such as "0 have a remainder of 1").  And you can solve the content by testing the numbers that you know about, and subtracting out those that fit the pattern, and once you have done that, you are left with enough information to deduce what the remaining numbers are that you hadn't known about.
Bottom line, there can be a new incentive for miners to include as many fee-paying transactions as possible.  Some miners may still decide to *not* include small-fee transactions, simply to discourage small fees.  But at least they won't have incentives to include very few transactions for fear that they can't spread the word fast enough.  No matter how many transactions they include (up to very high limits) there is no penalty.

That's good info.  One thing I don't care for is:


bitaddress.org uses the B6 data directly, rather than SHA256'ing it.  If there's a flaw discovered in SHA256, such that ascii text with such a small range of options (1,2,3,4,5,6) creates a small key search space, we're doomed.   (Yeah, I know that's a long shot.  But still...)
But with this fork, I can easily fork it to not perform the SHA256, and instead do a direct conversion from base-6 to base-2.   Thanks for the lead!

One of my pet peeves is that they pass off the Bitcoin Address as a public key.  It is not. 
You send to the Bitcoin Address "of the next owner", not the public key.  Small nit, but technically inaccurate.
The Bitcoin Address is derived from the public key.  And the public key is not revealed until you want to spend the bitcoins.  So the sender doesn't even know what the public key of the recipient is!


Regarding the transaction, each
slot or address in the Internet
-wide ledger has a public key
that serves as a pseudonym (users can have several public
keys, which do not need to be tied to each other, or to the
users’ real-life identity). Each sl
ot or address in the ledger also
has a private key, which the owner must keep secret. In each
transaction the previous owner signs—using the private key
that corresponds to the public key/ledger slot—a hash of the
transaction in which the Bitcoin was received, as well as **the
public key of the next owner.** This transaction can then be
added to the set of transactions that constitutes the Bitcoin,
and because each transaction references the previous
transaction, those transa
ctions form a chain.

Your version isn't precisely correct.
1.  A transaction is created by the sender, and could include more than 2 addresses.  Often it's multiple input addresses, one (or more) output address and a change address.
2.  It takes about 10 seconds for the transaction to traverse the entire P2P network.  Each node verifies the authenticity (that the signature is valid and that it's not a double-spend) before forwarding it.
3.  Independent of this transaction, Miners are grabbing groups of unconfirmed transactions and trying to mine a block.  That is to say, it's not an incoming transaction that "triggers" the mining process.  They are always mining, whether there are any unconfirmed transactions waiting or not.
4.  You have an extra step 4 - this is really combined with step 5.
5.  A bunch of unconfirmed transactions are grouped together and confirmed together.  Think of this step as analogous to the monthly "closing of the books".

I think the best analogy is this:  You can take a $1 bill and pull your Sharpie out, and change it to a $100 bill.  There, you just made a counterfeit hundred dollar bill.  You are now richer.   But are you?
In order to *really* be richer, you need to convince people that this is really worth something.  And, although you might be able to trick someone, you merely stole from that person.  Convincing the majority of people is the real challenge.  If you can somehow convince the majority of people that "Sharpie $100's are worth $100", then you're onto something.  But it'll never happen.
Same thing with Bitcoin.  You (or Satoshi) can some along and create software that makes new, fake bitcoins.  But unless you convince the majority of users that this new software is "legitimate", you are only fooling yourself.

Well, your liability would be the TAX on the difference between those two values, yes.
You'd use fair market value.  And you can probably use any fair market value figure that you can substantiate and look an auditor in the eye while describing.  Maybe I am wrong, but personally, I think if you make an honest attempt to pay your taxes, and your methods are justifiable, you will be fine.  If your methods are wrong, you may have to pay back taxes.  But if it appears that you gave it a reasonable effort, with reasonable logic, then you probably won't get penalties, fines, etc.  But I am not a tax accountant.  Maybe I am kidding myself.
I figure if you are a smart guy, have a degree or two, and keep reasonable records, you shouldn't have to spend a week's effort or thousands of dollars to be compliant.  Do your best, have some sensible logic, document what you do, and try to be compliant, and things should work out ok.
Also, you have no obligation to OVER pay your taxes, so there's nothing wrong with being aggressive when in doubt.

I think the $5M was a warning shot to the rest of the industry, and was the amount that the *US* government could seize within their borders.
I think the rest of the seizure, threats, and coercion was done secretly much like the lavabit threats were done covertly.  The US government would have too much explaining to do, if they had to explain why they were blocking access to Bitcoins held in Japan and elsewhere.
There's probably an "m of n" cold storage, and the US figured out how to block (n-m+1) locations, and that's when they brought the hammer down.  They're not after Gox or Karpeles any more than they were after the lavabit guy.  But they got a big enough hammer to get Karpeles to cooperate, no questions asked.
(again, pure speculation)

It was all part of the deal, hypothetically.  They need him to keep running the exchange, to continue to provide information about who is moving large sums of money. 
In the case of lavabit, they didn't have a good enough lever to keep the owner from just shutting down.  In the case of Gox, they have a carrot and a stick.  The Stick is the threat of prison for his "crime".  The carrot (or dessert-like coffee, if you prefer) is the opportunity to continue to profit from Gox, assuming he agrees to continue to provide information.

I don't think so.
As a simplified example, imagine if the only thing that was distributed was the sum (XOR) of all n transactions in the block.  That means that if you had a mempool of n-1 transactions, you could sum them all, and XOR it with the sum that was distributed to you, and you'd have the unknown transaction. 
You could do this with n = a million transactions, and, if you have any (n-1) transactions in your mempool, you could recreate the missing transaction.  And that would be approximately 1:1000000 compression - significantly less space than transmitting the entire list of transactions.
The IBLT proposal allows for more error, more missing transactions, etc.

Mt. Gox was having trouble tracking transactions, because they were relying on a transaction hash that was changeable up until the point the transaction gets included in a block.  
Mt. Gox proposed in their press release that the devs come up with a new id to track unconfirmed transactions.
Devs came up with a method to do that, and submitted a patch for this transaction tracking mechanism, and asked for comment. 
Mt. Gox gave no substantive comment for three days.  All the devs were asking was "will this work for you", and they got nothing.
Finally, Mt Gox commented that this method would work for them, and there's one case where it doesn't quite work (but no biggie).

But if there really were only 2000 BTC in Gox's storage, buying bitcoins from users does nothing.  You'd be buying fake bitcoin IOU's.  Sure, you'd be reducing the liability to users, and getting a small fee, but not increasing the amount of bitcoins held in storage.
The only way to increase the amount of Bitcoins in storage is to go elsewhere (you know, where the bitcoins REALLY were) to buy them.  Like on another exchange.

As I said in a post yesterday, one single $18M market order would eat every ask order on BitStamp, and drive the price to $100,000/BTC and the "market cap" to $1.25 Trillion.
The trick to investing hundreds of millions of institutional capital into Bitcoin is to do it at a rate that is slow enough not to drive up the price dramatically, but fast enough to take advantage of the low prices.
Best of luck with that!  I believe it will occur, but I think it takes some expertise in matching the "investment rate" with the rest of the market.  You don't want to be the guy to invest $20M, drive the price to $100,000/BTC, and then watch it plummet.  You need to pace yourself with appropriate care.

I'm not sure about that.
I think that rewarding those vendors who accept Bitcoin will encourage them to continue to accept it, and encourage others to accept it.  Therefore, spending Bitcoin makes the system more valuable because we end up with more ways to spend Bitcoin.  
And it's logical that the exchange price is positively correlated to the value of the system. 
This would imply that spending Bitcoins helps to make Bitcoins more valuable.

I am no expert, but what I gleaned from the technical documentation was that since the full transactional data is encoded into the IBLT, once you delete the known transactions from *a copy* of the IBLT, you will be left with a "differential" IBLT, telling you the full transactional data of the missing transactions.  You can then dump out that IBLT data directly, with a high probability of success, and retrieve all missing transactions.
You simply look for entries with a count of 1, and then extract (and delete from the IBLT copy) that transaction.  Then repeat.
See page 9 of [this pdf]( on Listing Set Entries.
Edit:  
I should add that you know whether you were successful in recreating the list of missing transactions in a couple of ways.  One is that when you attempt to dump out all unaccounted-for transactions, the copy of the IBLT will end up being all zeros if successful.   Then, as a second verification, you can take the total list of transactions, put them in canonical sequence, along with the header, and successfully verify the block.

No, there will likely be one "last bubble" at some point, at which time it will set a high that doesn't get approached for years, if ever.  
But it's not likely you'll be able to time that perfectly.  By spending a fraction each month, you will average out over time, spend some during the peak month (with maximum gain), and have less buying power during lower months.

My understanding:
They were creating non-standard transactions that started getting rejected in mid-November, when the transaction standards started beginning to tighten up, thanks to a new release of the reference client.  Other full nodes, updating their software, were causing some of Gox's non-standard transactions to be not propagated.
So their transactions were not being forwarded as aggressively starting at that point.  (They could still be included in a block, but they weren't forwarded widely.  So it wasn't until they were included in the block that they would be distributed across the entire network.)
This opened a window for fraud.  Because prior to that point, you had to "race" the transaction from Mt. Gox, trying to distribute your modified version before theirs got widely disseminated.  Now you had more time.  And the longer after mid-November, the more time you had, as more clients updated.
Once they began losing track of which money was spent and which wasn't, they were hopelessly confused.

OK, I am pretty ignorant of world events, so, after googling a little bit, and trying to get educated, I thought I'd contribute my brief findings.  Feel free to correct me where I am wrong.
The protests in Hong Kong are peaceful protests over the right to vote.   It's about democracy for Hong Kong.  In a nutshell, legislation was passed that required candidates to be "approved" prior to being able to be elected.  And this caused an uproar.
There's a lot of history around Hong Kong's affiliation with China and the British Empire.  It's a small region on the sea in the southern part of China.  It's about 420 square miles (1100 square kilometers) - so think about a circle with an 11.5 mile radius (19 Km radius).  It has a population of 7 Million.
It's fairly independent now, but some fear that China will be exerting control over political candidates with this recent move.  
This is not your standard "occupy" movement, which, in my opinion, in the US lacked clear goals or success criteria - people protesting the 1%.  This is about freedom and the right to vote for who they want (suffrage), and having the people's voice count.  This is about retaining independence.
The protesters organized and even produced a manual of conduct for *peaceful* protests (do's and don'ts, how to behave when confronted, etc).  They even have signs apologizing for the disruption.   and they are cleaning up after themselves.  The whole idea is radical - if the state comes down on them, then they will garner more sympathy for their cause, because they are doing nothing wrong (or very little).  It's a very clever strategy, and the recent riot police and tear gas has already caused their ranks to swell in sympathy.
Obviously I am hitting the high points.
Sounds awesome to me!

I think you are confused.  You are confusing cost of transaction with payment for processing transactions.  
If you are mailing a check, and you put a 49 cent stamp on it, your cost is 49 cents.
If the post office is delivering to a remote area, and decides to pay an external service $100 to deliver your letter rather than to deliver it themselves, that didn't change the "cost" to you "of your transaction".
The "charitable block reward" as you call it, is hung out there for people to claim.  And so people are willing to fight for it by spending a lot on mining equipment.  If that were to go away, fees for the transaction wouldn't necessarily shoot up to replace it.  At the most, they'll go up to the marginal cost to run mining equipment profitably, which will naturally go down due to people being less willing to fight for it.
This isn't rocket science.

I'm not going to argue the merits or pitfalls of "bit".  Set that aside for a moment. 
There are a lot of things in language that get implemented that are bad ideas.  Like using "literally" to mean "figuratively".   And people decide these things in their every day use.  And one person can't stop it.  It gets to the point where the dictionary gets changed to define "literally" as "figuratively with emphasis".
So, since you can't stop it, and I can't stop it, and "bit" is being used more and more, then what's the solution?  Language adapts.  So I think my best strategy personally is to adapt as well.

One of the tricks is to diversify assets to ensure that you have assets that don't have high co-variance.  Diversifying to alt coins, for instance, doesn't help your risk-adjusted return (much, if at all).  But having some stocks, some bonds, some real estate, some speculative stuff like crypto-currencies means that you can actually hold some very aggressive positions (highly volatile) and smooth out the risk-adjusted returns.

The Bill of Rights isn't about granting you (or Americans) freedom.  It's about controlling government-run-amok.  The value isn't in granting you some rights.  The value is in helping to ensure that your natural rights aren't infringed upon.
Man-made laws can and will exist.  You can bury your head in the sand and pretend that they don't, but they do.  And laws that control bureaucrats from creating other laws that infringe upon our rights have value.

This is silly logic.
If you look at the exchanges, and tried to buy every Bitcoin for sale, it would be a MUCH higher price than the current "spot price".  And as the price rose, more Bitcoins would likely end up being for sale.
You focus on the opposite, like if every seller wanted to sell all at once.
Spot price is used for a reason.

I never said Peter Todd is Mark Karpeles.  I don't even know how you can PRETEND I said that.  I also didn't say that the technical contact knows everything about every single thing that is written on a site.
But I DO think it's important for the CEO of one of the largest Bitcoin Exchanges to have knowledge of the very protocol that he is facilitating exchanges in, or to hire competent people to have that expertise.  There's no excusing this.  It's a fucking documented problem that Gox even said was discussed on the forums.
It doesn't really matter if it was known by my grandmother.  We're talking about the CEO of one of the largest site using the protocol.  I don't know how "well" well needs to be.  If it's talked about on the forums, documented on the bitcoin wiki for a year (and, let's face it, that site only has less than 1400 pages, and the vast majority are spam or commercial.  The technical specs are pretty few).
If his team hasn't read that site in a year, or the forum, they SHOULD be embarrassed.

You don't need to store everything everywhere for a blockchain to be valuable.
The sequencing / time-stamping function can have value if only the concerned party stores *the information that they are concerned about*.  Case in point, a distributed document time stamp system can take the hashes of documents (with the document never being disclosed), and perform Work (Proof-of-Work algorithm) on the set of hashes to be time-stamped this block. 
The solved block contains a Merkle Tree of all hashes contained in that block and a reference to (i.e. hash of) the previous block.  So effectively, no one needs to store *anything* except the information that they were trying to time-stamp, and the corresponding entries in the Merkle Tree, which is a TINY amount of information.  There's no need to store the whole block chain, but *someone* needs to store the path back to the genesis block (or to a well-publicized checkpoint) for verification of the chain, which is also a tiny amount of information (block hashes for each block).
The only reason the entire Bitcoin blockchain is necessary is because you are trying to prove a chain of custody from when the Bitcoin was mined (which is NOT necessary in all time-stamping applications).  In fact, we could snapshot the blockchain at some point, marking which addresses held which bitcoins, and build a Merkle Tree out of that, and then throw away the whole darn historical Block Chain.  People would only need to prove chain-of-custody (ownership) back to the snapshot.

This attitude is very confusing to me.  It seems to me that if you believe that Bitcoin will rise in value tremendously, all you need to do is to obtain some, and you will be on the other side of the equation, *which is what every early adopter did*.

You could always buy more, and help your cause (providing upward pressure through demand).
Example:  For every one coin that you bought at $900, buy ten at $520.   Then your average buy-in price is about $555, and you make money if it hits $555 and beyond.
Of course, this requires guts and money.  Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.

Critics serve a few valuable purposes.   Some point out valid challenges with the technology that need to be overcome.  Others point out the silliness of the froth that rises when there's a bubble.
I know (in real life) of two (and there are probably more) pro-bitcoin people with major bitcoin investments, who have second accounts that they use to talk down bitcoin-hype, and try to control the price growth, when it's taken an unusual run up in a short period.  You can see them in and in It might be obvious to you who they are.  They come out very strongly and vocally when the price has a run-up.  They clearly have a strong knowledge of the technology and some of the current limitations and challenges.  And they know exactly the things to say to make people second-guess their lunar aspirations.  And suddenly when the price  drops from 580 to 450, they are pretty quiet.
That's not all bad.   If you have a five-year timeframe for your investments, and during that period, you'll earn more money in your day-job that you can invest, maybe you want "controlled" growth until the last few months of the five-year period.

The argument, though, goes something like this.  
Say the reserve rate is 20%.  I deposit $100,000 to a bank.  The bank can only loan out $80K.  Someone borrows the 80K to build a house, and pays the builder, **who deposits it in the bank**.  Then the bank can lend out 64K to another home owner wanna-be, who also pays to build a house.  The builder deposits the 64K and the bank can now lend out 51K.  and so on.
So, 100K was deposited, and yet there's tons of extra "made-up-money" in the system.
I am not arguing that this is a huge problem... merely explaining it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:14:10


you wouldn't, unless you were interested in supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem or get a certain amount of pseudonymity.  Why do you find that hard to answer?
That's like asking about credit card bonus points or airline frequent flyer miles... Why would you buy airline tickets so that you can buy more airline tickets?   Yet that doesn't make the frequent flyer miles worthless.   They're worth something because you can spend them.  And many people hold them for quite a while and spend them at a later date.
It makes sense for people *who have* bitcoins to spend them (or to save them for a purchase later, if they want).  It doesn't make sense for someone to buy them to spend them.   But guess what?  When you spend them, then someone else has them.   
I have bitcoins because people have spent them on my goods and services.  I look at Bitcoin as a system of vouchers (like rewards points) that I can spend at a variety of places (not just one) to buy a variety of things.  
And if you see that this system can ultimately get very big, where, say a significant portion of the world's population has received some bitcoins and happens to be holding on to them for a purchase later, like they do with bonus points or airline miles, then it's real easy to see why they might have value.  And so you might buy some for long-term investment purposes, and spend some to support the infrastructure (i.e. your investment).

Which is more likely, that a single provider (such as the government) will drive the price up, or that multiple providers in competition with each other (such as multiple governments, if you will), will drive the price up?
You can see today (but perhaps you don't realize it) that the single US government has driven prices up for basic services, due to their monopoly power.  These costs are astronomical due to inefficiencies of the monopoly with guns.  And they keep adding more services with their monopoly power, with ridiculous costs, yet people are too naive to see it.
And that's why it will eventually collapse.

Not sure why "bitcoins cannot be used as collateral".  He must be thinking that they fluctuate too much, but everything fluctuates.  It's just a matter of pricing that in.
I would gladly loan someone $10K, if they posted 100 BTC as collateral, that I could hold (or we could put with a trusted third party).  As Bitcoin moves away from the $100 mark for a longer period (since it was at $100 as recently as 3 months ago), I would even return some of the collateral.

@_date: 2014-07-09 10:29:46
Basically, yes, plus one more function:  a wallet can use the private key to allow you to sign transactions which spend the bitcoins.
Typically wallets will manage *collections* of keys.  The idea here is that when you give someone your bitcoin address, you can give each person, each time, a different bitcoin address - for your own privacy.  So the wallet will need to store a bunch of keys, and watch a bunch of addresses.  
Within the past year or so, a development in Bitcoin wallets called "deterministic keys" has made this a standard process - the wallet comes up with one master key, and derives all other keys from that master key.  And so all you would need to back up is the master key (plus any keys that you manually imported into the wallet that don't follow that convention).
So, a wallet like Electrum will give you a 12-word code to memorize that translates to the master key that is used to generate all other keys.  Your backup, then, is the 12-words.

Time to set up a Bitcoin Index.  Sort of like the [Wired 40]( (I can't find a recent version of this...)
My suggested make-up would be publicly traded stocks that support bitcoin. They get added to the index on the day that they begin accepting Bitcoin.  Their contribution to the index should be some formula based on an expectation of Bitcoin's contribution to their top line of sales (based on their annual sales), and the fraction of retail locations that accept Bitcoin.
For example, Overstock and Tiger Direct, you could look at their annual sales, and weight them in the index accordingly, based on last years' sales.
Tesla, on the other hand, one retail outlet out of, say 1000, is accepting Bitcoin, so Tesla's weight in the index would be .001 x Tesla's annual sales.  (or maybe we don't add Tesla to the index at all).
The index started at 100, on the day overstock implemented Bitcoin (around January 9th?), and was nearly 100% Overstock stock.
Somebody calculate this!

The other cool thing about this hack is that this theft (copying) and the corruption of private keys could have been done years ago, and yet no one noticed that anything was missing for years, which increases the likelihood of critical evidence being erased from people's computers or brains.
Bitcoin has enabled a whole new class of white-collar crime.  Steal "a copy" of the private keys, which doesn't look like a crime until later when you move the money - long after the physical evidence of the copying is gone.

You already conceded.
There are several problems with your example:
You focus on one use (a sharpening tool) and try to draw a conclusion about all utility.  However, another use shows the problem with this:
If you are trying to make a precise clock or an oscillator, you will find that a quartz's property of frequency resonance far surpasses that of a diamond for the purpose of accurate clock-making.  Diamonds don't work as well as quartz for clocks, no matter what the cost.  
Using your logic, it is the resonance frequency of quartz that helps it give more utility and thus has more value.  (restating your sentence almost exactly.)
But wait, this has produced a conflict.  How can quartz be more valuable than diamond in one scenario, and yet diamond is more valuable than quartz in another?  It must not be intrinsic value then.  It must be relative to the use.  Then you can get into the argument of which use is more valuable, sharpening or clock-making.  But that, too, is a subjective argument, relative to the situation and person.  
So clearly there is no absolute value, hence no intrinsic value - merely intrinsic properties that have relative value to different people in different circumstances.
The second issue I have is the first statement that you make, and ask if we can agree on it.  "relative intrinsic value" is an oxymoron.   Is it absolute or relative?  Is it an intrinsic value, or a value relative to the situation that you are applying it to?

The security of transactions can be measured by the cost of a potential attack, which is a function of the amount of work that is performed on each transaction, as well as the cost to acquire the facilities to perform an equivalent amount of work to un-do that transaction.
Bitcoin's "proof of work" is extremely costly to un-do.  Litecoin's is a tiny tiny fraction of that, and the resources can be purchased by a faction who has control of a botnet or any other ordinary computers.

When someone hears about X (Bitcoin), they tend to make a quick decision as to whether X is good or bad.
As time goes on, and comments are made, and situations change, they tend to become more invested in their decision that X is [good or bad].  
And as more people line up on the opposite side, it brings out what you refer to as anger.  This is the "I knew about X years ago, and decided it was [good or bad], and by God, if I chose wrong, I will look foolish, so I am going to dig in my heels."
The chasm grows between those that made the decision that X is good and those that made the decision that X is evil.  And they start spewing comments that the other side is stupid.
Look at Apple products.  Or Facebook.   Same sort of thing.

Help me understand this.  I'm not trying to be a dick. I just want to dig into this a little deeper.
So, the dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government.  They typically aren't producing good and services; quite the opposite.  They are a drain, a tax, on the production of goods and services.
There's no backing.  If I want to cash in my dollars for some piece of that production (like, own a part of a tank or a part of Coca Cola Bottling), there's no backing - only exchange rates just like bitcoin.  I can't just say "ok, Government, here's my $100, give me a piece of your production capability" any more than I can with Bitcoin.

Imagine a world (country, city, virtual world, whatever), where the entire economy is run on Bitcoin.  Then it has use value with no (or infinite?) exchange value.

I saw an ELI5 that was pretty clear, and so I'll try to paraphrase it:
Imagine Bitcoin withdraws from Mt Gox as written checks.  People withdrew Bitcoins, and the way Gox tracked whether the payment went through was to take a photo of the check, and then watch the blockchain for that exact photo.  But it was possible that someone put a mark on the check, changing the photo so that it was no longer identical, and then cashed the marked check.
So Gox thought the payment wasn't processed.  At the users' request, they would put another payment through to the same user.  Meanwhile, since they though the old check wasn't spent, they'd sign those checks over to other people, but they were no good.  So their books got all screwed up.

The weird thing is that this flat out wouldn't work.  The document said he had 2000 BTC at the end.  Say he had 22,000 BTC, and took 20,000 to BitStamp, and sold them for a good price.  He now has the fiat, and brings it back to Mt. Gox to buy more.  So he executes transactions on Mt. Gox to buy more, and on paper has say twice as many.  But the Gox exchange still only holds 2,000 BTC, even if his paper entry says he has 42,000.
He can't transfer his paper entries to BitStamp.  The BTC wouldn't exist.  BitStamp would want a Blockchain transfer of real BTC.

In the '80's, the stacks of major networks were most often *not* TCP/IP.  IBM was pushing SNA, the [OSI model]( protocols were required by the US Government (and TCP/IP was not allowed to be used in Government proposals until about '94).  I don't know the exact architecture of the original AOL systems, but I believe that their main data center was in Fairfax County, Virginia, and you had dial-up to a local modem, and your connection was routed, likely to a mainframe, in the Fairfax data center.  I suspect that they were using IBM's protocol stack (not TCP/IP).
In '92, AOL [announced]( a gateway to pass messages from the AOL network to the internet.  The gateway bridged between AOL's stack (probably IBM's protocol stack) and TCP/IP.
Now everyone is on TCP/IP, and connection to the internet is natural.  Back then, though, it had to be accomplished through gateways, because the two networks could not talk to each other otherwise.
I don't believe that politicians used the term "Information superhighway" because they were afraid the internet would fail.  I believe that the term was used to "dumb it down" to the average american, or to coin a phrase.

Here's a real world randomly occurring event, although admittedly not natural.
Presumably [the Bitcoin block hash]( is relatively random, at the low-order bits (the high order bits will be zero).
So if you want to have a random event that occurs on average approximately once per year, that would be once every 52,560 blocks, assuming a block roughly every ten minutes.  
The last four hex characters should come out to be 0000 (or any other particular hex value) approximately every 65,536 blocks (or every 455 days), assuming a block every ten minutes.
Or, if you want to be more precise, the probability of the last nine digits of the block hash coming up less than 00013F338 is 1/52560.0075, so that should happen about once per year - a little more often due to the fact that Bitcoin is mining blocks a little faster than scheduled.
Random Triggers, based on block hash:
1/hour - Last 2 hex characters less than 0x2A  
1/day -  Last 4 hex characters less than 0x01C7  
1/week - Last 4 hex characters less than 0x0041  
1/30 days - Last 7 hex characters less than 0x000F2BA  
1/year - Last 9 hex characters less than 0x00013F338

But if you are invested in one asset, it might be *your* highest performing asset, while being a poor performing asset.
You should read up on the scholarly articles about risk and diversification.  It's been shown both empirically and mathematically that there's an optimal level of diversification, such that you produce the maximum risk-adjusted reward.
I don't think anyone would disagree that if you happen to pick the best performing asset, you'll have the highest returns.  The problem is that it's very difficult to pick the best performing asset.  


Read the research and scholarly articles.

I'm not going to pretend it *can't* be on an s-curve, but my gut feel is that adoption will be an s-curve, while price will be bubbly. 
When adoption gets to the "top part of the s", there's an inflection point where everyone can look back at the recent past and see a major hockey-stick growth curve.  There, you have the vast majority of people already adopted, and potentially making the mistake of thinking that this rapid growth will continue. 
So when the vast majority of people pour money in (by, say, buying bitcoins), and there's fewer and fewer people to join the party (late adopters and laggards), there's the ultimate shock wave.  Too many investors expecting continued rapid growth, and not enough prospects to allow any more rapid growth.
That's where the bubble bursts, in my view.  And we're no where near that.  And, from that point forward, it'll probably resemble Gold's price action.  From then on, it'll be a "relatively" stable commodity like Gold.
But what do I know!?

I'm using Mycelium like I use a dollar wallet.  I'm willing to carry about $50, and I want it to be as convenient as possible to spend.  If I lose it or get hacked, it's limited exposure.
Your idea of per-address encryption is interesting.  Then I could have my $50 spending money unencrypted (or loosely encrypted) with no password required.  Larger amounts would be tightly protected, and I could easily move money to the loosely encrypted area periodically as needed, keying in that long password.
That way, it's the best of both worlds.  You get your secure encryption, I get my quick-to-spend interface.

I have to disagree.  Part of the success criteria of digital currency is user acceptance.  And there are several contributing factors: 
1.  no market confusion.      
2.  no chance of inflation.     
3.  no fear of pump-and-dump.     
4.  the network effect.
Alt-coins add to the clutter and noise in the market.  They cause market confusion.  They confuse potential adopters.  Many are pure pump-and-dump schemes with no serious difference, hurting the credibility of all coins.  They provide an avenue for inflation, in that you can just add a new currency.  Every ounce of energy spent on alt-coins is a loss of energy being spent on one coin.  Consolidating efforts and putting all our weight behind one arrow is the right solution.
**It's analogous to a political party (the Crypto party) trying to unseat an incumbent (the Fiat party) and someone arguing that we should get ALL of our party's candidates on the ballot for the election, because any true believer in the fundamental principles of our Crypto Party shouldn't care which of our candidates wins.**

You can use any assets as qualification for a loan.  You could use artwork.  You can use collectibles.  You can use anything that you can reasonably claim value.  (Granted, banks may choose to discount some, based on the marketability or type of asset.)
Bitcoin clearly has value, and is easily appraised.  All you need to do is demonstrate proof of ownership, and a coinbase statement is reasonable proof.

There's not a serial number of each bitcoin!
Bitcoins are units of account.  They aren't something you can point to.  Like "inch" or "ounce", it's a unit of measure.  You can point to an ounce *of something* but you can't point to an ounce.
Think of **bitcoin addresses** as something similar to bank account numbers that have a balance, expressed in Bitcoins.  
Bitcoin is an unfortunate name, because people think it's something like a coin.  But it's really simply a way of expressing a balance.  And when someone mines bitcoins, that is, when someone performs the accounting function for Bitcoin, their account balance is increased by 25 bitcoins (currently).

Note that the process is to print a paper wallet (make a copy!), then transfer (send) the bitcoin to the paper wallet.
Note that this is NOT a backup of the coin on Coinbase.  You have MOVED the coin to paper.  So you then need to protect the paper (which, traditionally, is easier than protecting something online).  And really, what you are protecting is trying to make sure that no one else knows the long number (private key) that starts with a 5.  (So don't show anyone your QR code of that number.)
You are trying to protect that number so that you have access to it at a later date, but no one else does.
My main point here, though, is to point out that it's not a backup.  It's moving the coin.

The old process involved Walmart or CVS's Moneygram, Zipzap, and Bitinstant.  It looks like one of the players (Bitinstant) would be dropped out of this new process.

Is it possible he is re-using a picture that he got from someone else, somehow?

If my first paragraph is correct, then since uBit and µBit mean the same thing from your perspective, and µBit, by SI standards means a millionth of a Bit (not a millionth of a Bitcoin), then uBit cannot mean Bit.  So uBit must go away if Bit is to survive (and it has the current momentum and lead), or it cannot be the same as µBit.

We could go to a market cap of tens of billions, simply by somebody placing a market order for significantly less than a billion dollars.

You have a lot of assumptions in your post.  One is that Bitcoin will continue to rise in price.
But there is nothing stopping people from being early adopters (or adapters as you say).  The only thing that stopped people from jumping in a year or two ago was lack of awareness, lack of faith, lack of guts, perhaps lack of money or hardware, and lack of effort.  
A year ago, it was hard to envision Bitcoins breaking $1000.  This past weekend a year ago, I got laughed in my face by my friends, literally, for saying Bitcoins were a "buy" at $15.  I told them again on Saturday that they're a "buy" at $790, and now they said "we missed the boat".

Actually it's almost an identical scale.  That is, it's "relatively" nearly identical, just at higher numbers.  The percentages are almost identical.
Look at it on a log chart, and see that the last four "bubbles" spaced 7-8 months apart.  Then note that after the bubble, the weekly chart bounces around a little bit (almost identical each time), and has approximately 5 weeks of losses in a row, before bottoming out.  We are in week 5 of this cycle; we've had 4 consecutive negative weeks, and this is the fifth.
Past performance doesn't mean shit, but it is interesting to note that the pattern is nearly identical.  Chart readers were predicting a $600 coin this week, at the bottom, and then a climb to new highs between next week and July, and the first part came true.

A few issues:
First, centralized systems are bottlenecks.  Every attempted spend of a particular coin would need to go through the same system.
Second, the block chain distributes the ledger, but since a person can submit a transaction to two different points in the network, you don't avoid the issue unless/until everyone agrees on the ledger again, which is the block confirmation process.  You would have the same issue in a centralized model if you tried to remove the bottleneck.
There's no advantage that banks have, here.  Their system creates a huge performance issue due to the fact that everything has to go back to one point.  They work around it by batch processing transactions, adding delays, approving certain levels of purchase (available balances), and allowing balances to go negative.   In the cases where they don't allow balances to go negative (like wires), they make sure your "available balance" supports the full amount requested and require the transaction to go back to the single bottleneck.

So, if a company sets a growth target of, say, 10% per year.... or heck, let's say 2% per year... and tends to achieve that, on average, why don't you think that's exponential?
Or are you saying that doesn't happen?
Looking at the 2% growth example,  
Year-2 = Year-1\*1.02  
Year-3 = Year-2\*1.02 = Year-1\*1.02^2.   (see the exponential part?)  
Year-4 = Year-1\*1.02^3  
Year-5 = Year-1\*1.02^4

You have to leave enough assets in your account to back your obligations.  And if the price changes dramatically, such that your collateral is in question, then the exchange starts liquidating your assets without your explicit consent (per the agreement), until your collateral is back in order.
This is called a squeeze.  It can happen if you short Bitcoins, and the price rises rapidly, or if you go long (with borrowed fiat), and the price drops rapidly.
It's leveraged positions, which can have large gains, or lose everything.

No my logic is that if I spend a bitcoin on a million dollar item, and then bitcoin drops to a dollar (using your stupid-as-hell numbers) and I buy a bitcoin, then I have both the bitcoin and the item, and am out $1 - as compared to before the purchase, when I had the bitcoin and the dollar, and not the item.

Sounds similar to an experience I recently had:
I visited and helped my son move into his out-of-state apartment last week.  Went to Target to load up on all the things a person might need in a new apartment  - curtains, cleaning supplies, TP, beer.  The bill came to $350.
Chase rejected the transaction.  Tried another card.  Chase rejected that one too.  So here I am at the cashier of Target, after ringing up $350 of stuff, with a line of people cursing me, thinking "those assholes... they approved at least 5 charges already on this card in this town over the past day.  They know I am here."  
So, I have to call them and play twenty questions, literally publicly announcing all my credentials to everyone who can hear the call:  mother's maiden name, top secret 3-digit "private key" on the back of the card, billing address, etc.
All the while I have three things going through my head:  
1) Bitcoin would have been a much faster checkout.  
2) Can Target be trusted with my credit card number after their recent leak?  
3) I should have used Gyft.

There is a technology called Bloom Filters that help to protect privacy.
The concept is that you reveal a little bit about the addresses that you are seeking information about.  A simplified example would be something like this.  "Give me all the transactions that involve bitcoin addresses such that when divided by 153 give a remainder of 12."   That would give you a bunch of transactions, and you could discard the ones that you don't care about.

Well, the theory is that the money was stolen by the government.  We know that some was seized.  My theory is that we don't know the full extent of it. 
So it's not Karpeles who is stealing and frauding.  He's doing the opposite (in this theory).  He's trying to keep it together, to earn back all the money in commissions and then make good on deposits.  
The alternative would be to go out of business (which he could certainly choose to do), and people would get back pennies on the dollar, thanks to their greedy Uncle (Sam).  But Kapeles knows that this is a losing move as well - since he'd be villainized at this point, even though he didn't steal the money.

There *is* a range of acceptance, and it is OK to recognize that fact.  (I agree that this headline is misleading, but I disagree with your position which is at the opposite end of the spectrum.)
At one end of the spectrum is the business that does not accept Bitcoin and does not mention it.  At the other end of the spectrum is the business that accepts bitcoin directly, perhaps with no middle man, or perhaps uses bitpay to accept bitcoin, but doesn't do an auto-conversion to local currency.
In between, there are companies like Dell, who accept bitcoin and mention it as a payment method.  This is a positive step along the continuum.  Then there are companies like Overstock, who accept bitcoin, mention it as a payment method, promote the use of it, and (soon-ish) keep a portion of payments in bitcoin.  This is even further along the continuum.
It's not just the use of a middleman that is the issue.  After all, if they used a middleman to help them accept payments (much like many companies use middlemen like paypal or Visa), but kept the bitcoins, it would be big news.

No, you paid exactly the exchange rate.  You are trying to mix in a time element into the equation by saying it lost value while you drank your beer.   YOU are mixing in the time element, not me.  But as I said, if YOU want to mix in the time element, then simply replace your bitcoins at the bottom price.  You said, essentially, "what if they keep dropping in value", to which I replied that this means a bigger discount (because you are replacing them at the bottom price).


No, YOU are adding in a time element which has as much to do with bitcoin as a currency as any other currency.  Want to add time into the equation, then you are talking about currency speculation, plain and simple.  You are speculating on the dollar (or whatever your currency of choice is) right now, but it may not feel like it.  People who are holding bitcoins are speculating on bitcoins, whether they like it or not.
There's nothing magical about this.  You probably just need to give it a little more thought.  If you have lived in a country with major currency fluctuations, this would feel more natural.  Sounds like you haven't.

There are three numbers that are relevant, although two are commonly used.
private key -&gt; public key -&gt; bitcoin address
The **Private Key** is 256 bits long. It is often represented by an approximately 51-character string starting with a "5".  See  to see one.
The **Public Key** is derived from the Private Key, but it's near impossible to go the other way.  The Public Key is pretty much hidden from the user.
The **Bitcoin Address** is much shorter than the private key,  You'll often see it as a character string of about 35 characters starting with a "1".  The Bitcoin Address can be easily derived from the Public key, but not the other way around.
 
Think of the Private key as sort of a bank account number + pin combined together.  It can "hold" a fractional amount of Bitcoins, no bitcoins, or lots of bitcoins.
Think of the Bitcoin Address as sort of a "depository bank account number", that allows for people to make deposits and check account balances, but you can't withdraw/spend unless you know the Private Key.


Answer:  No.  Bitcoins are actually an abstract concept.  There's no such thing as a Bitcoin that you can point at.  Instead, your Bitcoin Address has a Bitcoin Balance, much like your bank account has a dollar balance.
To pay your friend some bitcoins, you need to know his bitcoin address.  And then your Wallet Software "signs" a transaction, transferring the coins from one (or more) of your bitcoin addresses to his Bitcoin Address, and returning any "change" back to an address that you control.
The "signing" of the transaction places your Public Key into the transaction (which proves that you have the private key, without having to reveal the private key, using the math of "digital signatures").

So lemme get this straight.
If the top 10 pools published twitter messages saying "we will build atop 2MB blocks", and they seemed to be trustworthy messages, then we could have big blocks today.  Today.  The next block mined could be 1.9 MBs, and the top ten pools would mine atop it.
So there's this thing called 'bitcoin unlimited' which automates that process, digitally signs the messages, requires them to be included in blocks which require proof-of-work.  This validates the authenticity of the messages and weighs them according to mining power.
And this is somehow a "change in the core bitcoin game theory"?  yeah right.

Exchanges, when functioning properly, always have the dollars and bitcoins that people deposited, and just exchange between the two (sometimes taking a small cut).

I think you are way high on your 5-6 million.
First, you seem to be assuming for some reason that Satoshi's are lost.  I disagree with that.  If you invented something, and had faith in it, and understood it, why would you lose the keys?
[This article]( has some real good evidence that through [block 36288]( one person or organization mined 1 million Bitcoins, and is presumed to be Satoshi.  I have no reason to believe that those are lost, and have lots of reasons to believe that they are not lost.
That fortune is (only!) 55% of the first 36288 blocks.  You could assume that the other 45% were lost, but since a substantial amount of those have been moving, I'd say this is unlikely.
I also don't believe that Gox "lost" 600K coins, in the sense that they are bitcoins that are lost.  I believe that those were Gox-coins... coins "on account", that were not really on the block chain.  Otherwise, you'd be able to point to bitcoin addresses with tons of coins in them and account for them.  Of course, we won't know more until the bankruptcy proceedings advance (and maybe never).
I do think that a lot of early experimenters generated some bitcoins and quit.  I would generously estimate that number at 10,000 people successfully mining a block each on average, or a half million coins.
Some other losses have to do with people getting them from fountains in the early days and losing them.   And of course, people die, lose their keys, have hardware failures, etc.  I can't imagine the total is over 1 million lost.

If everyone stores the blocks that matter to them, and the headers of all blocks, this works just fine.

Once something is published, it's VERY hard to unpublish it.  Ever try to get that embarrassing nude pic off the internet?  It's hard!  Blocks will not magically disappear, no matter what fucktards come along.
Still, I see your point.  It'd just be extremely difficult to imagine it ever happening in real life.

First, look at "central banks" - you know, those guys who just keep printing more money.   Bitcoin helps that situation.
Second, consider that you can "be your own bank".  Storage and transmission fees of money go to near zero.  Forget about paying the salaries of all those people that work in a bank.  We get efficiencies, and those resources can be deployed in a better way.

I think this approach to explaning Bitcoin at an introductory level is one of the better ones.   Satoshi must have struggled, like we all do, as to the best way to explain Bitcoin in a simple manner, so that the key benefits and architecture can be presented to the layman quickly.  
In my opinion, Satoshi's approach here introduces the reader to Bitcoin better than the white paper (and it's shorter), although the white paper is obviously more complete.

If you spend 1.5 BTC on merchandise and the retailer uses Bitpay, and if the retailer does an auto-conversion to dollars, then Bitpay is purchasing the BTC from the retailer.  
Bitpay may sell it on an exchange, or pay their employees with it, or keep it.

I disagree; perhaps not "regulation of bitcoin", but it is absolutely "bitcoin regulation".
Define regulate:  


It is supervision (oversight) of the asset by means of regulations.  It means laws about Bitcoin.

Since you ask for an alternate explanation that could imply innocence, I'll propose one.  I'm not saying this is fact, I am trying to come up with something that could be fact.
1. The operators fear the law, because they realize that they have made some sort of mistake that might have given up their identity in the past, or because they recognize that the best thing they can do is keep appearing to change identities.
2.  So they shut down, and are throwing Law Enforcement off their trail.  No sense in pursuing a shut-down website.
3.  They moved all coins to safe storage, and gave some bogus excuse, to throw law enforcement off their trail.
4.  They will be reimbursing people silently, anonymously, and over time after mixing the funds.
Unlikely, yes, but that's the best I could think of.

OK, I'm going to call you on this one.


I'd like to see proof that the charges were dropped.  
Here's my proof that you may be wrong.  The first charges were in the New York Federal District, and [never had murder for hire charges.](  The indictment had a complete background story which told of hit men and Ulbricht admitting to trying Silk Road, but those weren't included in the charges.  So they weren't "dropped".
[The second indictment, in Maryland,]( is, to the best of my knowledge still pending, and is the case that has the Murder for Hire charges.  
Please point me to something that says that the Maryland Federal District dropped their charges.
The only thing I remember seeing was Ross's Mom reacting to the charges in New York, and saying that she was pleased that they didn't push the Murder-for-Hire charges.  But really he was never *initially indicted* in New York for Murder for Hire, so they didn't drop anything.
Correct me if I am wrong, with links, please.

I tried to explain your site to someone (and the futility of trying to index the site - not to mention, that there are much more efficient ways to do the same thing!)  I said that if you look at the number of DIGITS of the number of pages, it's 75 digits.
About 90% of the randomly generated private keys will be on page numbers with 75 digits.  And 99% will be on page numbers with 74 or 75 digits.  And 99.9% will be on page numbers with 73-75 digits.
So *all* you need to do is to count from page 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 to the last page, and you'll find 99.9% of the bitcoins.  **GO!**

I am bullish on Bitcoin, and I think that these prices are going to look great in a year.  But one thing I must take issue with is:


They are pumping money into companies, not Bitcoin.  I am trying to think of a dot-com bubble analogy:  VCs were pumping a ton of money into dot-coms.  And dot-coms were using that money to rent real estate in Silicon Valley.  So, you could say that being in the Silicon Valley Real Estate business was great, because of all the money that VCs were pumping into dot-coms.
But those dot-coms can implode, go virtual, move out of the valley, ot funding can dry up.  That doesn't make your real estate investment a good one.
Likewise, Bitcoin companies can pivot, create the next great virtual currency, or go bust.   You could still end up being a bitcoin bagholder.

Go look at last July.  This is a mere 8 months ago.  Bitcoin had peaked in April at $250 or so, and was doing its death spiral below $100.  People were trying to wait until it climbed back to $100, so they could get out... and when it fell below $90, they said "fuck it, cut my losses".  When it hit $80, more said the same.  It bottomed out at around $65, when my friends were saying "abandon ship".  And some pulled out their original investments.
It rallied back to $100, then $120, then shot up to $1200.  Those same people who bailed at $65 and $80 and $90 were re-buying at $200 and $400.  You could see submissions on reddit by people who were saying "how could I have lost focus on the long term?"

You can get bitcoins to exchanges immediately to sell, and then sell them to get your traditional fiat currency.  But receiving that currency can take time.
Also, account setup can take time.
If you are in the US (and since we're talking about Overstock.com which accepts Bitcoin for US purchases), Coinbase is pretty easy.  You set up an account and verify it just like you would a paypal account.  This might take a few days.   Once you are set up, then the "transfer and sell" process is nearly immediate. They may wait an hour for confirmations.  
Then when you sell, they ACH the fiat (dollars) to your bank, and that takes the usual delays for ACH (Automated Clearing House), which is typically a few days.
Buuuuuut.... knowing how most US employees treat bonuses, I would expect that much of the bonus money would simply be stored away, as money that is not Dollars is too hard for many people to think about.  I have seen numerous people accept stock options, not understand them, stick them in a drawer and forget about them.

I feel like Bitcoin came out of the blue (many people, including myself, were working on cryptocurrency for 15 years, but no one came up with the breakthrough of P2P shared ledger until Satoshi).
I wonder if the successful alt will pop onto the scene like Bitcoin did.  In other words, "none of them" will be "anywhere near a practical proof of concept" until the problem is solved.  It won't approach 100% of solving incrementally... one day it will be 0% solved, and the next day it will be 100% solved, and a new alt will be on the scene.
That is a little bit scary.  I wonder if Bitcoin will be able to adapt quickly enough to fend off such a competitor.

Start with Satoshi, the core developers, the major contributors, the people who built surrounding companies (the coinbase guys, etc), the fraudsters, the foundation guys, the alt-coin guys, etc., noteworthy guys and companies that have come and gone (Instawallet, bitcoinica, Bruce Wagner, the hype-ster back in 2011), etc.

It seems to me that this is a slightly different branch of mathematics from compression - more like hash tables or database technology, with a little bit of RAID mixed in.
With hash tables, you take a giant array, and take a key-value pair, and hash the key to arrive at an index into the giant array, and stick the data-value into that slot in the array.  It's a lot like that, only reusing the same slot over and over (by summing or xor-ing the result).
You can check to see if a known transaction exists in the data set.  And then through elimination, you can extract the unknown transactions (with some probability of success).
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:12:27
Careful on the losses, though.  There's something called "wash transactions".  If you bought back within a certain period (30 days, I believe), you cannot immediately recognize the loss, and instead, you adjust your basis.
So in your example, 1 BTC bought for $900, sold for $650, and then (say, within ten days) bought back for $600.  Your basis on that coin is now $850, with no taxable event yet.  (You reduced the basis by $50 with the sale+buy).
If you later sell for $750, you can take a $100 loss (if you wait beyond the wash period).  So you would have spent $900+$600, and sold for $650+750, showing the $100 loss.

And as I said, I am not disagreeing with you.  I tend to think your assertion is correct, and your data supports your assertion (with a sample size of 1).  But I just thought it was a little bit of a stretch to use this as a conclusion, as if you have proven this to be true, with your small sample size.

He's not opposed to a currency that has the backing and the oversight of the Federal government, and then he goes on to say that the Federal Reserve has been the best at that.
Hey douchebag Senator, just because the Federal Reserve (a PRIVATE COMPANY) has the word "Federal" in their name, it doesn't mean they are part of the government.

For dogecoin or litecoin to "reach zero", the general market place would need to be trading at zero.  And if you have some dogecoin or litecoin, why would you decide to part with it for zero?  The only reason that I can think of is if the cost of holding it is greater than the cost of disposing it - that is, if there was some risk to holding it (like a government saying "we will arrest anyone found to be holding Litecoin).   That's not going to happen.
So it will never "reach zero".  It might stop trading because no one wants it, and you can't find a buyer.  But "reach zero"?  naaah.

This makes no sense.
If the volatility risk is 50%, and his profit is 50%, it makes no difference whether he sells $2.50 worth or $25 worth.  At $2.50, he might lose $1.25.  At $25, he might lose $12.50.
The only way this could make a difference is if he has a different profit percentage based on size of order, but marginal costs of a coffee shop really don't work that way.  Loaded costs do, but that's irrelevant.

I wouldn't necessarily conclude that.  The percent graph shows the top 100 hovering around 22%, but not really dropping.  If anything, it seems to be inching up very slowly, with sudden drops as there are hacks or auctions or liquidations.
By 2020, there will be about 18.4M bitcoins.  22% of those is over 4 million BTC.
Again, though, many of these top addresses are multiple people's holdings, in exchanges.

[Here's the link](
Pretty interesting, but he plays out half of arguments and stops when he feels it's in the favor of the point he's trying to make.  And he wraps that in a wrapper of authority, but there are definitely some gaping holes in his argument.
An example is where he talks about why there can't be a million dollar bitcoin, because of the tremendous costs of energy to support the network.  But he ends the hypothetical scenario right there.  He doesn't carry it one step further and asks what happens if energy is in such demand by bitcoin mining that it raises the cost of energy for everyone else (like Visa and MasterCard and traditional banking networks).  If one can convert energy to bitcoins worth a million dollars, why would energy be sold for cheaper to other institutions?  And then what happens to those other institutions when the price of energy goes up?  He ends his analysis short.

I think it's more likely that he hasn't really thought this out.  At $25, he has ten times more at stake, so volatility will hit him ten times as hard as at $2.50.
But this is a real life example where someone *who wants to accept bitcoin* is confused or misinformed.  So if you want to help spread acceptance, these are the sorts of things that you'd have to overcome.  It's helpful to hear this, so that an appropriate response can be formulated.
A response like:  a) use BitPay to reduce volatility.  or b) demanding 10x the transaction size multiplies your volatility exposure by ten.

Feel free to make it more clear.
From the paper, page 8, some examples are given so that you can see that the result of the calculations are:
    Running some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z.  
    q=0.1 
    z=0 P=1.0000000
    z=1 P=0.2045873
    z=2 P=0.0509779
    z=3 P=0.0131722
    z=4 P=0.0034552
    z=5 P=0.0009137
    z=6 P=0.0002428
    z=7 P=0.0000647
    z=8 P=0.0000173
    z=9 P=0.0000046
    z=10 P=0.0000012
    q=0.3
    z=0 P=1.0000000
    z=5 P=0.1773523
    z=10 P=0.0416605
    z=15 P=0.0101008
    z=20 P=0.0024804
    z=25 P=0.0006132
    z=30 P=0.0001522
    z=35 P=0.0000379
    z=40 P=0.0000095
    z=45 P=0.0000024
    z=50 P=0.0000006
    Solving for P less than 0.1%...
    P &lt; 0.001
    q=0.10 z=5
    q=0.15 z=8
    q=0.20 z=11
    q=0.25 z=15
    q=0.30 z=24
    q=0.35 z=41
    q=0.40 z=89
    q=0.45 z=340
So yes, the probability of a successful attack goes to zero, as z gets bigger (that is, a transaction becomes significantly more irreversible as more blocks are solved).

I default to the belief that people and companies should be allowed to do business with whomever they want.
But in the case of banking, the government has already put up huge barriers to new banks, and banking is nearly essential to everyday living (above the poverty line) these days.
If the regulations are going to limit entrance to the banking industry, then they should also restrict banks' ability to pick and choose their customers.

I found the section discussing [Gresham's Law]( to be thought-provoking.
The concept behind Gresham's Law is that if there's a currency, like a silver half dollar, that the government suddenly changes the metallic make-up to be less valuable (like, if the coin was formerly 90% silver, and it is later 40% silver), that people will prefer to spend the bad money (40%), and hold onto the better money (90%).  And so the bad money remains in circulation, while the good money tends to be hoarded.
If you believe in Bitcoin, and believe it to be a superior form of money, you might then expect that people will prefer to pay with fiat*, and hoard their bitcoin.
This would lead to people wanting bitcoin more, and therefore bidding it upon exchanges, or offering discounts if people pay in bitcoin.  Both of these things would lead to bitcoin becoming more desirable and lead to more hoarding.... never quite allowing bitcoin to achieve huge circulation presence, even *if* it becomes easier to transact than dollars.
I'm not sure that this would be a failure state for Bitcoin.  On the contrary, I think that if this situation occurred, then bitcoin would be the "good money" that is driven out by the "bad money" (fiat).
\*I almost capitalized FIAT just to irritate user "nobodybelievesyou".  It seems like he hates that.  Then maybe I could justify it as an acronym for um... Frickin Inflatable Assets by Treasury or something...

This is counter intuitive.  I don't understand why you'd say that.

I would contend that the verdict of a guy who has almost 1% of all the bitcoins might have an impact on the price.  
If he is found not guilty, then there's less of a chance he'll dump them onto the market, as opposed to almost certainty of another auction or two if he's found guilty.
The verdict brings certainty to an unknown in the market.

Well, given that the US Dollar is "legal tender for all debts, public and private", people won't be able to refuse dollars for debts.  And so others, who are holding dollars will pay dollars (to get rid of them), preferring to hold their bitcoins.  Then the recipient holds the dollars, and they will get rid of them when they can.
And so fiat will continue to circulate, and more so than bitcoin.  That's my theory, and common belief, I think.

Anything you do to try to put your Bitcoins to work to earn more Bitcoins involves lending them to someone else or risking them in some way.  Sure, you can try that, but there have been so many crooks and pump-and-dump and ponzi schemes, it's hard to recommend anything.

Agreed.  One of the issues with the analysis is that it starts with just a few existing industries and evaluates "what if" Bitcoin takes x% of that existing industry.
Missing from the analysis are the other industries that never existed before can suddenly appear due to the simplicity of wealth transfer over the internet, and due to the "program-ability of money" that Bitcoin now facilitates.  Certainly online gambling becomes a lot easier.  As does simple payment of cash to a friend (remotely).  Along with all the future possibilities like escrow, wills, tracking ownership of stocks, etc.

You'll have to tell me where I am wrong.
A) he stated that the upper limit is 21,024,000.  This is absolutely incorrect.  The upper limit is 21 Million.  You can see it in the code.
[Here is the code](
    int64_t GetBlockValue(int nHeight, int64_t nFees)
    {
    
    int64_t nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
    
    // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
    
    nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= (nHeight / Params().SubsidyHalvingInterval());
    
    
    return nSubsidy + nFees;
    }
nSubsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks, which means when you are half way to 21 Million, you cut the subsidy (block reward) in half.  When you get halfway closer, you cut it in half again.  You never get to 21 Million.  There's absolutely no possible way to get to 21,024,000.  That number is absolutely incorrect.  OP was wrong, I was right, and you can see it in the code.
Also, you can verify this in the wiki:


b) The value of COIN can be see in the code [here](
    static const int64_t COIN = 100000000;
This part of the code designates the number of "satoshis" per Bitcoin, which basically defines the precision to eight decimal places (currently).
So if you multiply the upper limit of the number of Bitcoins (established to be 21 M, in point (a) above), times the number of individual units per bitcoin (10000000, as shown here), you get 2.1 quadrillion individual units.  This is fact.
You can also verify that fact on [the wiki](


So, your move.  How is he correct and I am wrong???

Imagine Transaction-Data equals:  "I want to pay 1 Bitcoin to address-X, and it is mine thanks to previous transaction-Y"
The complete transaction would contain this info:  (Transaction-Data, Public Key, Digital Signature).
The Digital Signature is the result of math performed on (Transaction-Data, and Private Key).
Anyone can verify the soundness of this transaction by doing math on (Transaction-Data, Digital Signature, Public Key).  If any one of these three is changed, the math will fail.  However, the math succeeds if nothing has changed, proving that the creator has the corresponding Private Key (without revealing it).

But the difference is this:  Bitcoin has value as a payment system if it is widely exchangeable for any non-zero number.  If bitcoins drop to a penny a piece, they still have value as a payment system.  The value is in their transferability across the world as long as the rest of the infrastructure is there (exchanges and merchants).
So, price does not dictate success or failure.  Number of exchanges and merchants does.  As long as those are in place, and bitcoin exchange rate is a positive number, it has value.  And as long as the exchanges and merchants are there, bitcoin will have a positive (non-zero) value.
Granted, it's much more valuable at $580 than $0.01 (in that more people can store and transfer more wealth, and higher values of wealth can be transferred).  And this is another fact that supports the price.
TL;DR:  These ain't tulips.  Tulips:  Not limited supply, not easy to exchange, not easy to store, no properties that make them a good "money".

Supposedly, they do not save the private keys, but you need to trust them on this.
They generate the private key on their end (as opposed to bitaddress.org, which handles it all in JavaScript).  I can see why they do this, though - from CoinBase's perspective, it's the safest way to ensure that the paper wallet is good.  Still, you need to trust them.

Sorry, I forgot that you wanted a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet.
First, the method I described allows you to generate a truly random wallet.  (This removes the risk that there might be something wrong with bitaddress' random number generator).  But it doesn't allow you to create a BIP38 wallet.
A BIP38 wallet is extra secure (or extra risky depending on your ability to remember the pass phrase).  With BIP38, you need the paper wallet and the pass phrase.  Which is cool.  If you want one of those, you can generate one on the paper wallet tab (and just generate 1.  No need for 3).
But then you need to memorize the pass  phrase generated with diceware.  That seems hard to me - and I am thinking that you will probably end up writing it down anyway (maybe separate from the paper wallet).  But you can certainly do that.  A 12 word random phrase should be excellent.  Can you remember that?
The alternative that I posed was to simply print the Wallet Details page (after the 33x3 dice rolls), which has the Bitcoin address and the Private Key on it.  Then you need to protect that piece of paper.  But no pass phrase is required, for better or worse.
A third alternative is to go to the Brain Wallet tab, and think of a "pass phrase generator" that only you and your family would know the answer.  For instance "The last names of my 8 college roommates, alphabetized, with only the 3rd character caps, followed by my social security number.  No spaces or dashes."  You can write and remember that phrase.  You could even post it over your computer.  And that would be virtually unhackable.  So you put the "answer" to the generator into the Brain Wallet part, and generate a brain wallet.
One final tip:  If you have a substantial amount of money stored with a private key, you can use the website  (again, completely offline) to split the private key into *n* pieces, where someone needs to gather *m* of them, to crack it.  For example, 5 pieces, where 3 are required to crack it.  Then you can distribute the 5 pieces to your closest confidants and lawyer.
So, basically, you have a lot of options.  They really depend on your situation - how likely are you to forget a random set of 12 words a year from now?   How easy is it for you to protect a piece of paper?  etc.
You can go to bitaddress.org and play with it at no cost, so just try some stuff.
Glad to answer any other questions.

Well, in order for you to mine with a GPU, you would need software.  And unless you could write it, you would have had to wait until October 1, 2010, when someone else released it.  And even then, I'm not sure it would have worked with your card.  
If you could write the software to be doing GPU mining, then you probably would have earned a significant portion of the 2009 coins (1.62M BTC).

You don't need a mining rig to verify transactions.  Simple PC can verify the transaction.
You may be referring to confirmations (which are not verification).  Verification is the checking of the validity of the transaction - that it has valid inputs and a valid signature.

The concept of a paper wallet is that you store your Private Key on paper.  Then you send your Bitcoins to the Bitcoin Address associated to that Private Key. 
The benefit is that it's generally pretty easy to keep paper stored for a long time and protected.  You can put it into a safe.  You can make copies of it and store it in multiple places.
 
Another benefit is that if you do it properly, your Private Key has never been exposed to the Internet, and so your Bitcoins cannot be stolen by anyone except someone who gets hold of your paper.
Keep in mind, a Private Key is simply your own 256-bit secret code.  (Think about 256 coin flips.)  If done completely randomly there is virtually zero chance that anyone else in the world, ever in the future, will be able to guess your sequence of coin flips.  It's just mathematically so unlikely that you can say it's a statistical impossibility for as long as the universe has existed or is expected to exist (with technologies known today).
So the trick is to somehow generate those 256 bits in a random, offline manner.  There are some tools to do that.  If you go to  that website will generate a paper wallet for you.  (Try it - it doesn't cost anything, and you can generate as many as you want.)  There's also  which uses the same underlying technology (and programming) as bitaddress.org, and creates pretty ones.
Obviously, using a computer to generate your private 256 keys has some risks, since you would ideally be doing it offline, on a computer that never touches the Internet.  This is for the super-paranoid.
I personally know of people who have stashes of $100K+, who have used bitaddress.org to generate their paper wallets, with minimal precautions.  Not that those are role models, but if you are pretty good about your security, you can create a paper wallet on there, and sleep well, knowing you aren't trusting someone else with your money.
So, the simple thing to do is just go to  and wiggle your mouse, and press print.  And you have a paper wallet.  On a virus-free PC, you should be perfectly safe with this.
More advanced techniques, in order of complexity and paranoia:
a) Visit the site ( in a Private Browsing window (each browser calls this something different - incognito mode, private browsing, etc).  Then, while the page is loaded in your browser, turn off your internet connection, so you are offline.  Turn off wireless, etc.  This might be easiest by disconnecting your router from the internet, which should still maintain your printer connection.  Then press "regenerate wallet" a few times, and, when you like the number that you see (for whatever reason!), press print, and you have a paper wallet.  Then reboot before reconnecting to the internet.   (This level of security will work even on *most* virus-laden PC's, since viruses to date aren't smart enough to handle this level of disruption.  This will change over time as virus writers get smarter.)  Obviously, best practice is to use a virus-free PC!  THIS IS THE LEVEL OF SECURITY THAT I RECOMMEND FOR MOST USERS, WITH REASONABLY SMALL AMOUNTS OF BITCOIN WEALTH.  It's a good balance of strong security with very little hassle.
b) the next level of security up, if you are more paranoid, is to actually generate the random number yourself, by rolling a dice 100 times, or through other means.  One user on this forum recommends this, and it's a very clever thing to do.  Use the "Brain Wallet" feature of bitaddress.org, to key in a "passphrase" and make it a very long series of random results (dice rolls, coin flips, etc).  By doing this, you are reducing the risk which woul dbe caused by bitaddress.org being corrupted, or that the random number generator is flawed. (A flaw was recently found in the Android random number generator, so this is a very real possibility.)  
**note**  a lot of money is lost from people using the brain wallet feature and using long, but well known, pass phrases.  If it's a line from a song or a line from a book, or anything that has been indexed by Google, do NOT use it; you are putting your money at risk.  Using 100 dice rolls is extremely safe, though.  
c) For the super paranoid, or for a lot of money, it is recommended that you create a fresh operating system install, and never let the machine touch the internet.  It's not too difficult to create a Linux CD or USB bootable device and boot from that.  Then move the single file (Bitaddress.org is one HTML file that you can "Save" from a connected PC, and transport to your disconnected PC), and open that web page and generate a brain wallet.
Hope that helps.  I don't want to make this topic complicated, and really, your security is probably 20x better by simply following the basic instructions mentioned above, rather than storing at an online service.  Online services get robbed!

The current implementation is stored as I described, with a limit as to how small you can go.  But there's already discussion about how that can be changed in the future, if necessary.
Right now, the minimum slice of a Bitcoin is 8 decimal places.  But there are other limits currently to prevent people from using transactions that small, due to too much "dust" clogging up the system.  So there are currently some higher restrictions in place to limit real tiny transactions.

Schiff's response to the sentiment that you express is basically that Bitcoin only has subjective value - you can send value to someone (in Bitcoin) only if they think it's valuable.  And someday everyone *could* all at once decide that it has no value.

Hmm... I'll take a crack at this.
Your Private Key is a random collection of 256 bits.  Imagine 256 coin flips.  No one can guess that.
Your Bitcoin Address has a special relationship to that Private Key, in that you can derive the Bitcoin Address from the Private Key, but not the other way around.
Your Bitcoin Address acts as a depository account number.  Your Private Key acts as a Pin, or a spending number.
The Block Chain contains a bunch of transactions - checks that have been passed around.  Some of the checks have been paid to your Bitcoin Address, that you are trying to spend.  Each Transaction has a unique number.
So when you try to spend money, you identify the transactions that paid money to this Bitcoin Address - the checks that you are going to "sign over" to someone else.  And you specify the address(es) that these checks get spent to, potentially including a change address.  And then you [digitally sign]( that transaction. 
Digital signatures have the property that you can prove that they were signed by the correct party, without that person having to reveal their private key.  That's the "magic" behind digital signatures.  Unlike your PIN or your CVV/CVC number on the back of the credit card!  In those cases, you need to reveal it to prove that you know it.
Ironically, in the case of the CVV/CVC number, they use that as proof that the card is present.  Yet the first person you told that to could then use it as fake proof themselves!  And how many people have you revealed that number to.
With digital signatures, I can look at the signature and tell that you had the Private Key when creating the signature.  And yet you are not revealing the private key.  You are generating a signature from it, and I can verify that you had the Private Key, but I cannot tell what that Private Key is, so I cannot steal it and forge your signature later.
Hope this helps!

Your public key is sent along with the transaction (unencrypted) to use in the proof that you have permission to spend.  Also, a digital signature is sent (which is the mathematical result of a combination of the private key and the transaction data).  So any other node can take the signature, along with the public key and prove that the transaction data has not changed and originated from the holder of the private key.


Every node in the p2p network "verifies" the soundness of a transaction before passing it along to other nodes. Note this verification is NOT the same as confirmation done by miners.  Verification is just making sure that the transaction looks right, and was initiated by the correct spender, and  that the money is OK to be spent (i.e. not a double-spend).


yes, they could undo any transactions.   But then the transactions would simply be in the "unconfirmed" state, waiting to be confirmed again.


No they cannot spend other people's bitcions because the digital signature holds the transaction together.  If they tried to change the recipient of a transaction, then the digital signature wouldn't match.  Remember, the digital signature verifies the soundness of the transaction (that the sender had authority, the amount of the transaction, who it goes to, etc.)

It's not impossible to reuse a paper wallet.  It's just not recommended.  
You can create a transaction with a "partial spend" of a paper wallet, returning the change to the same paper wallet.  But it's not something a novice should try.  And it has the exposed your public key to the network, reducing the security of the paper wallet to some degree.

I think bitcoinstore would be a miserable failure without Bitcoins.  A little guy selling merchandise online for dollars - that's a rough business, with the likes of Amazon out there (unless you sell through Amazon, and then it's not so great either).
So it's proven to be a door-opener for this enterprise.
More to your point, though, right now people in the US think in dollars, and Bitcoins are fluctuating much more wildly.  So it's natural to communicate in the common language.
I shop online with credit card points and bonus points for sales promotions, and my first tendency is to try to do a conversion. 1.2 points to the dollar or whatever.  It's just human nature.
If the current trend of reduced volatility continues, then in a few years, pricing in pure bitcoins might make more sense.  But it will be a long time before it's "natural" for me to think in Bitcoins.  Heck, when I was in Europe, I was constantly converting to dollars in my head to see if it was a good deal or not.  I don't think in Euros or Pounds or Krohner.  And those are much more stable than Bitcoin.

I'm with this guy to an extent:


The proper way to evaluate an investment is your expectation of future results.  But there are other reasons for cashing out, and the primary one is diversification.  When one asset goes up 5000%, it often causes imbalance to your portfolio, leading to unnecessary risk on one asset.
If a multi-millionaire invested $100 in bitcoin, and it went up 5000%, he now has $5100.  There is probably no reason for him to diversify.  However, if a broke drop-out invested $1000, and he's up to $51,000, and that makes up 90% of his assets, then by all means, re-balancing is in order.

Oh, but it IS $1,000,000 (per *some* small amount of gold).
Nobody knows where the price of Bitcoin will land, but I suspect that it will settle into a range like that:   from x to 6x within a range of 100 years.
And if bitcoin does eventually mimic the value of gold, in terms of total market value of all inventory worldwide (what some people call "market cap") then yes, it's a really big number.

payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
**ELI5 version: Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash, where a ledger is shared among all peers, transactions are secured with digital signatures, and the sequence of transactions is established by performing work on transactions.**

This fact is not irrelevant in that it totally debunked your previous statement that "Very few people control most of the Bitcoins and this can never be reversed".
People whine all the time about how unfair the system was, and yet everyone had a fair shot at being an early adopter.  It was not obvious that Bitcoins would ever be worth more than a penny each.  
The system puts a high incentive into a few people to build out the network.   I doubt that would work without decreasing the reward over time, because people would just sit back and say "I'll wait to see if this catches on... There is no benefit in joining in early."
However, you are welcome to start your own a-typical-redditor-coin, and just modify the source code and reward people differently.  Many people have tried that, with mixed results.

[Konrad S Graf actually addressed this]( fairly well on his videos (which also are linked on the page currently).
1)  You are looking for value of an individual item, when the value is the network.  What is the value of an individual telephone without the network?   According to Weisenthal's logic, since a telephone is essentially worthless without the network, then it has no "intrinsic value".
2) "Underpinning the value of gold is that if all else fails you can use it to make pretty things."  This statement is clouded by his own perception and societal blind spots.  In fact, historically there have been societies where shiny things (like gold coins) were feared and resisted.  They would actually pay to rid themselves of shiny coins.  So this doesn't put a "floor" under gold.  In fact, in those societies, gold would have a negative value.  So this argument falls apart.

You really need to view a log graph to properly view a price chart.  And really the question is market cap, not price.
As you can see, there's a general trend upward for the course of more than 2 years.  The rate of growth in the market cap is about 20% per month.  It's not like this recent period is any different.  We are slightly above that trend, and it could drop tomorrow, but it's not like we're in an anomaly right now.
Will we grow another 50% next week?  Probably not.  But will it fall to $100?  highly unlikely.   Sure it could, but past performance wouldn't indicate that to be a very high likelihood.  (I realize that past performance is not a good predictor of future performance, but you brought it up.)

The seller can always determine the price, and if it's higher than the value to the potential buyer, no sale takes place.  Cost does not determine value.
There is a relationship between price and cost when there is a "make vs. buy" decision, particularly of a commodity.  If it takes 20 hours to mold the perfect ball of poop, and you wanted one, then, assuming interchangeability of poop balls,  the value to you would be the cost of your 20 hours of labor to produce one yourself.
But again, this does not speak of the value of poop-balls.  The previous paragraph is completely contingent on the "and you wanted one" comment.  Value is independent of cost.
Also, not all poop-balls are alike.  If you had a certified poop-ball  of Michelle Obama's poop, it actually probably has value (to some wackos out there), regardless of how much time you spend molding it.  Again, it would be independent of the costs.

First, the subway guy wasn't set up optimally.  He simply had a paper copy of the QR code.
A better way to do it would be to have a QR code generated with the Bitcoin Link Protocol, which would automatically have the price and destination address encoded into it.  I'm fairly certain Bitpay does this, and it's well documented.
So if that was done, a QR code would be shown to the customer, and the customer would simply scan it and press send.
For payment verification, if the "system were integrated" (as bitpay is), each customer would get a different QR code, and the transaction would be seen on the network, and the cash register would be marked as paid.  This is all possible now, but most Point of Sale systems aren't integrated.
Secondly, some long-timers (Mike Caldwell is one, I believe) are advocating the possibility of the customer transmitting (or handing via card or paper) their private key which controls a small amount of Bitcoins, and the vendor removing the portion that is necessary.  This method would allow the consumer to carry something as simple as paper - no electronics.  (This is controversial, but not much different than the way credit card transactions are conducted now.)

I wasn't following it all that closely, but that was the impression I got.  I read that one guy donated 10 BTC (in four separate transactions, I think).
I agree, it's not the best way to give to charity.  On the other hand, I think the goal was to put Bitcoin on the front page, to get a bump in awareness and price, similar to the guy from Norway who found an old stash of Bitcoins that he bought for $27, and now they were worth $800K, and he bought an apartment.   (I *think* it was Norway.)

That's pretty funny to think about.
Really, though, I get stuck at "Bitcoins are... stored on...".  Are Bitcoins stored somewhere?  This reminds me of when the media says "Bitcoins are strings of numbers.....".  Are they?
They're really a weird abstract concept.  It's a ledger entry in a ledger that really doesn't exist, except as a block chain.  (The ledger could be computed and enumerated like a giant spreadsheet or table, but probably rarely is.)  You can't really point at any iron oxide and say "there's your bitcoin".
I suppose you could point at ALL copies of the part of the Blockchain that contains the transaction that transferred the Bitcoin to you (whether they be on disk or on CD or on paper, for that matter), and say ALL these atoms, collectively, are your bitcoin (in that if they were destroyed, your bitcoin would go away).  But then a future addition to the blockchain can spend that bitcoin making all those atoms no longer be your bitcoin.

The hashing power simply secures the network in a decentralized fashion for Bitcoin.
If someone creates a *centralized* cryptocurrency, no hashing power is even necessary.  All you need is a central server keeping track of the ledger.  If you are a merchant accepting GreekCoin, you simply accept the signed transaction, and send it to the central authority, who says "yup, no double-spend.  You're good to go." (with a signed message that couldn't be counterfeited by a man-in-the-middle).
It would be a heck of a lot simpler architecture.  No need to wait for 6 confirmations.  Nearly instantaneous.  Reduce the mining expense, and replace a very small portion of it with centralized servers.
Of course, it wouldn't eliminate the temptation to inflate the heck out of the currency.  It'd still be a huge boon for Bitcoin, because it would cast a light on how money *could* work.

You flipped the argument in a non-logical fashion, which made no sense.  Here's an example of what you just did:
Me:  "I drive my kids to school on school days."    
You:  "I'm not going to drive my kids to school unless school is being held.  Therefore school is held because I drive my kids to school."
This is totally illogical.
You are correct that miners won't dig rocks out of the ground unless they get something worthwhile for their efforts.  You are incorrect in making the leap that digging causes value.
If I am shopping for art, and the artist says "I made this artwork by expending a great deal of money", that is his issue, not mine.  Customers look at what the art is worth to them.  And it's very possible that the artist will take a loss.  Market value has nothing to do with cost, except that in a commodity market, the competitive cost to obtain it elsewhere supports or hurts the market value.  But it does not define the value.
Now, the artist may say "I can't get 10K for the art that takes me $10K to create" and get out of the business.  But that will  not drive worthless crap to be worth $10K.  Economics just doesn't work that way.

I know it's just math, and "one in a million" is a catch-phrase that means long-shot, but here are some more accurate odds for you.
Assuming you have a 33 MH/s USB miner, and the current network speed is 5096 TH/s (which is 5,096,000,000 MH/s, or just over 5 Billion MH/s).    So you have roughly 33 chances in 5 Billion every ten minutes (1 in 152 Million), of solving a block.


You were off by a factor of about 274 Thousand.  You have one chance in 274 Trillion of solving a block, several times a second.

pretty sure I didn't say that.   Not finding that with a search.
The author took his stats and concluded that this means it's a bubble.  One could take the same stats and conclude that the current investors believe in the platform (probably because they are seeing evidence of a platform growing in value) that is not *yet* showing up in the transaction volume.
[Kuznicki uses his graphs and claims]( they "Prove That Bitcoin Is a Speculative Bubble".  One can use the same stats to "Prove that Bitcoin price is predicting a massive upcoming increase in transaction volume" with as much credibility.  That is, really no credibility.  His graphs proved nothing other than that he could draw false conclusions from graphs.

Digital signatures are a different piece of the Bitcoin puzzle:
The transactions themselves are signed with digital signatures.  So someone can only spend money that they can prove that they own.
This is different math than the mining process.  Basically, the way digital signatures work is that you can use your private key to do some math on some numbers (the transaction), and then someone can take the result of that math, and use your public key to confirm that the private key was used in the math.  (That is, that the person who submitted this "spend" transaction actually had authority to do so.)
The analogy I use on Private Keys is this:  Whenever I use my credit card over the phone, the person on the other end of the line "proves" that I have the card in hand by asking me to read the little number on the back of the card.  This, of course, is bullcrap, because now they have my little number and can falsely "prove" to someone else that they have my card.  But with digital signatures, you can provide proof of having the private key without revealing it.  Very cool math.
So to answer your question:  Miners cannot forge transactions.  Only the owner of the Bitcoins can spend them.  Corrupt miners cannot.
The issue with corrupt miners is that they can "undo" transactions, if they own enough of the network.  And the attack would be something like this:  the evil miner buys a TV online with Bitcoin.  The transaction gets confirmed by other miners.  Meanwhile, the evil miner creates a second transaction, spending those Bitcoins to himself, and secretly confirms that block (and any subsequent blocks necessary to keep the scam going).  Once the TV ships, then the evil miner releases all these secret blocks to the network, "undoing" the valid transaction, and instead paying himself.  All nodes will then reject the "double-spend" (the valid transaction).
Also, the miners can choose which transactions they want to confirm.  But most attacks on Bitcoin would be pretty difficult at this point, unless you ran a mining pool.

The real question is, is it a step up from Bruce Wagner?  (Hi, Bruce,... I'm sure you're reading this!)
Since "the Bitcoin movement" will never rid itself of characters, then that just means that the more sane, civil, articulate people among us need to step up.  Erik Voorhees and Tony Gillippi and Andreas Antonopoulos are doing a great job drowning out the vocal radicals.

This is not splitting hairs.  You are giving incorrect information.
Transactions are "verified" by any node that receives them, before they are forwarded through the network.  "Verification" is not the same as "confirmation".  Verification is making sure that the transaction is basically sound - that the person who claims to be spending it actually has the permission to spend it.   But it does not prevent all double-spends.
"Confirmation" is adding "work" to a group of transactions, so that they can be SEQUENCED.  That way, you know which block of transactions came in first, which came in second, and so on.  That way, double-spending can be prevented.  Because coins attempted to be spend after they have already been confirmed spent in the blockchain will not be considered a valid transaction.  They will fail the verification step.

OK, well my recommendation would be trial-and-error: keep reducing the amount of the transaction, from 7 BTC to some smaller number, until those 1 Satoshi dust transactions fall off.    In the default client, you can specify how much you want to pay, and see what fee is suggested, and if it's too much, cancel that transaction at the verification stage, and then pick a different amount to pay.
So let's say he has a million 1-satoshi transactions.  So he reduces it to 6.999 BTC or whatever, so those million aren't included.
He can write off the 1-satoshi amounts as irrecoverable.   There's a dust-cleanup program that he can donate them to.   But then he's only losing like a buck to make the rest of the money spendable.
He can even do this as a binary search.  Try 7 and see the suggested fee. Cancel.  Then try 3 and see the suggested fee.  Assuming 3 is acceptable, cancel and then try 5.  If 5 is acceptable, cancel and try 6.  If 6 is acceptable, cancel and try 6.5.  Etc.

The issue with mining is that you can always expect to pay more for the hardware than the value in Bitcoins that the hardware will generate.  
Mining is efficient now, in that you can make money over the price of electricity and the effort involved.  But the market drives up the price of these machines to be more expensive than the coins that they produce.  If the machines are cheaper, people buy them up until mining becomes so difficult that they aren't worth buying.
So, short answer:  no.

Maybe you misunderstood the question.
It's a really small non-zero number.
10 Billion = 10^10.      
The number of unique private keys is 2^256 = approx 10^**78**~~25~~.
You can calculate the probability of picking 10^10 unique private keys, and subtract it from 1.
The probability of the first pick being unique is 100%.  The probability of the second pick being unique is (10^**78**~~25~~ -1)/ (10^**78**~~25~~).  The probability of the 10^10 th pick being unique is (10^**78**~~25~~ - 10^10 +1) / (10^**78**~~25~~).   Multiply those 10^10 numbers together, and subtract it from 1, and you have your answer.
Basically zero point zero with a lot of zeros.....  and then some non-zero number.

I'll take a crack at this.  In a peer-to-peer network, transactions are passed from one computer to another.  This means that different computers will get the transactions in a different order.  This is obviously a problem, if you are trying to figure out potentially which was first, of two transactions spending the same money.
The Bitcoin protocol's solution to this challenge is to gain consensus through "proof of work".  So picture a group of unconfirmed transactions floating out there in the network.  Machine "A" got them in one sequence, machine "B" got them in a different sequence.  In fact, it's possible that the lists aren't the same (in that if there's an attempted double-spend, each machine only saves one of the two conflicting transactions).  So machine "A" has a different group of unconfirmed transactions than machine "B", in different sequences.
The mining machines take a group of the unconfirmed transactions (literally, the numbers that make up thoe transactions), along with the digits that are a hash of the previous block, and also an additional transaction that pays them the block reward, one additional number (called a nonce), and performs some work - some math, called a hashing algorithm.  (Specifically SHA256(SHA256(block)).  If the result is "small enough", then the block is considered "confirmed".
The result of this math is a 256-bit string.  For any random "nonce", you can expect the result to start with a zero bit half the time, and start with two zero bits a fourth of the time, and start with three zero bits an eighth of the time.  So what are the odds that it will start with 54 zero bits?  Very small.
You can infer that if someone provides you a "confirmed block", that someone performed a lot of work to confirm it.  Because the only way to find a nonce that produces a small enough hash is to try a bunch of them, and get lucky.  So you can even estimate how much work needed to be performed (with some margin of error).
The cool thing is that, although it's hard to confirm a block, it's very easy to verify whether a block is confirmed, once someone gives you the block.
Once the block is confirmed, it would take a significant amount of DIFFERENT work to confirm a different block over-riding the confirming block.
The analogy I use in traditional banking is imagine a bunch of checks coming into a central bank, and the lone bank manager grabbing a stack of the unprocessed checks, processing them, and putting a large one-ton paper weight on them.  The paper weight is the "work", and to "un-do" that processing, you'd need to perform different work to move the paper weight out of the way.  Further, the bank manager stacks a second group on top of the first, and puts another one-ton paper weight on top of both, and now the first group is "confirmed twice", or twice as secure.
Does that help?

I'll repeat what others say.  Don't do it.  Day trading is a sucker's game.  In order to win, you have to guess right.  And there's someone on the other side of the transaction that is guessing too.  
The trading commission and bid/ask spread makes this really hard to succeed.  Those two things might make up a 5% difference on a conversion to and from fiat.  So you have to be right 105% of the time.
Better to go over to  where you only have a 1% "house edge".  Or even better, be the house at just-dice.  Or even better, just put your bitcoins aside for a rainy day, and spend them years from now, but only what you need to maintain your yacht.
That said, it seems that BTC China, with free commissions temporarily (I think), and high volumes (so probably tight bid/ask spreads) might be your best bet.

No, but the difference is that when you divide them, people who hold them still have the same wealth.
Reminds me of the joke "Do you want your pizza cut into 6 pieces or 8 pieces?"  "Better cut it into 6.  I don't think I can eat 8."
If you are holding enough pizza to satisfy you, or enough Bitcoin to feel wealthy, no matter how many slices you cut it into, you still have the same satisfaction or wealth.   The extra divisibility just allows you to deal with it in smaller chunks - whether it be to sell off pieces, or use them over time, or whatever.

"Undeniable Proof of Payment", eh?
So you say you are going to send me 1 BTC.  You can point at the block chain and say "See, there's the transaction where I sent you 1 BTC.  I can even prove that it was me sending it, because I can sign the inputs."  
But you CAN'T prove that it was my address that you sent it to.  In fact, you may have sent it to yourself.
Likewise, maybe you sent it to me, I can always say "that's not my address - my address is 1xyzabc...." and you have no way of proving otherwise.

After the attacks that we’ve experienced from August 2013 till the October we’ve lost user balances data and huge part of the funds. We still can not figure out the full list of vulnerabilities that have been used to perform the attack. One of the assumptions is physical unauthorised access to our servers which could take a place only if someone got an access to the hardware in datacenter.
Also we can’t rule out the possibility that someone found or create an exposure or backdoor in our billing software.
Currently we have few topics to deal with:
First thing that we’ve been able to figure out is that few fast miners have been cheating us using vulnerability in difficulty checking algorithm. This vulnerability is probably applicable to the other fair pools, so we will publish description in next few hours to help others avoid our fate. This difficulty fraud have led to the loss of the significant part of the funds.
Second thing is incessant DDOS attacks that started in early August and magically stopped in few days after billing was hacked (that seems to be the last stage of the attack).
Third thing is that we have weird jumping luck during August-September period which jumped from 40% to 120% daily and sharply increased hash rate of the few new users with abnormal large amount of stale shares.
Obviously this couldn’t be a regular coincidence and obviously this can’t be applied by one certain user. In general all of this only make sense if one or few competing pools decided to eliminate 50BTC for whatever reason. We are exploring all available data to figure out if some users was not real users but the proxied shares from the evilpool.
When miner formally connects to the evilpool it actually goes to the 50BTC through a proxy to get a job, and after that evilpool proxies all shares except of winning ones back to 50BTC. This could cause total bad luck that we’ve faced in a last few weeks.
But this is for sure not only things we will find in the next few days, before we will get the confidence that funds in pools wallets are safe. Only after that we will put additional funds and will enable payouts.
Still we are looking forward into the future with a hope and working damn hard rewriting our billing subsystem and moving our hardware to the another datacenter.
For all our users who believe in us and for all those bullshit fuckers who think that 50BTC is dead and already celebrating their victory, we have one main message:
50BTC is alive and will get back fast and stable as a hell in next few weeks.
Stay tuned

My thought exactly.  Bitcoin's market cap rate of change hasn't changed that much.  It's been pretty much following an exponential curve of about +18% to 19% per month for a few years.
It's pulled off that line on occasion (bubbles) and then returns to it.  It hasn't gone from 100% annual growth to 3000% annual growth.  You can smooth out the growth rate (simply by plotting it on a log graph) and see that it's a fairly straight line up and to the right.

Not sure tracing it makes any sense.  Those were at Coinbase.  You are probably looking at a lot of Coinbase hot-wallet transactions which have nothing to do with your coins.
Why would you send $10K via email, which is inherently non-secure by design.  It's like storing $10K at a locker at the bus station, and then writing instructions as to how to retrieve it on a post card!
There's also a good chance that the money won't be retrieved..... maybe Coinbase can tell you.  If you sent it to a bad email address, or the person just thinks it's fake, you might be making a lot of false assumptions!

Qt (/ˈkjuːt/ "cute", or unofficially as Q-T cue-tee[6][7]) is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a graphical user interface (GUI) (in which cases Qt is classified as a widget toolkit), and also used for developing non-GUI programs such as command-line tools and consoles for servers.
Qt uses standard C++ but makes extensive use of a special code generator (called the Meta Object Compiler, or moc) together with several macros to enrich the language. Qt can also be used in several other programming languages via language bindings. It runs on the major desktop platforms and some of the mobile platforms. It has extensive internationalization support. Non-GUI features include SQL database access, XML parsing, thread management, network support, and a unified cross-platform application programming interface (API) for file handling.
Qt is available under a commercial license, GPL v3 and LGPL v2. All editions support many compilers, including the GCC C++ compiler and the Visual Studio suite.
Qt is developed by Digia, who owns the Qt trademark, and the Qt Project under open governance, involving individual developers and firms working to advance Qt. Before the launch of the Qt Project, it was produced by Nokia's Qt Development Frameworks division, which came into existence after Nokia's acquisition of the Norwegian company Trolltech, the original producer of Qt.[8] In February 2011, Nokia announced its decision to drop Symbian technologies and base their future smartphones on Microsoft platform instead. One month later, Nokia announced the sale of Qt's commercial licensing and professional services to Digia, with the immediate goal of taking Qt support to Android, iOS and Windows 8 platforms, and to continue focusing on desktop and embedded development, although Nokia was to remain the main development force behind the framework at that time.[9]

When I set this up back in 2011, I had two machines - a web server and a private server.  I generated a bunch of addresses on the private server (which retained all the keys), and copied a file full of bitcoin addresses (not the wallet.dat file - not the private keys) to the web server, so that when someone needed a bitcoin address, I could supply them with one.  I made sure I had enough bitcoin addresses on the web server to meet my needs for the long term (including an allocation for abandoned transactions).
Separately, I had bitcoind running on a private machine (still connected to the net, though), and a small python script that was monitoring the "receive" addresses, and emailing me when I needed to ship merchandise, and creating a transaction to move my received money to cold storage.

Sorry, I wasn't very clear.
Here's exactly how I would do it, pretty much step by step.
1) take a photo of the document, or somehow get it into electronic form.  So Passport -&gt; JPG, for example.
2) using  , navigate to my jpg and create a cryptographic hash.  This doesn't upload your passport to proofofexistence; it does this all client-side.  So at this step you have both the JPG and the hash of the JPG.
3) go to multibit's sign function, or to  and type in a message that is meaningful (perhaps something like:  "12/20/2013  The person whose passport has the cryptographic hash of xxxx also has the private keys to this bitcoin address (1abcxyz...)".  Then use the private key of that bitcoin address to generate a digital signature.  
Note if you use brainwallet.org, you probably want to unplug from the internet when you enter your private key.  But you can practice there.
At this point, you have a JPG, a hash of it, and a signed message saying that the bitcoin address and the JPG are linked to the same person.

[Here's documentation on the URI scheme](  If I recall correctly, the examples intentionally don't work on this page (which is frustrating, but intentionally that way so that people don't accidentally send money).  If you receive a URI (whether it be a link on a web page or a QR code), and try to go to it / scan it, your Bitcoin client software takes over and loads that transaction so that all you need to do is confirm.
Presumably, if it was all integrated into the Point of Sale system, there'd be no opportunity for transcription errors.  Once the register calculated the amount, a QR code would be displayed.
There are some POS systems out there:     
     
I think the Mike Caldwell solution I mentioned (which I won't defend) is really more modeled after cash.  You are right - not credit cards.  Cash.

Now, this "good guy" has a chance to save the guy's butt.  I agree it should be "time bound".  With unclaimed funds, a year seems a reasonable amount of time.
My feeling is that he should sweep the account, leave instructions as to how to claim the funds, along with a one-year expiration.  
If, within one year, the person tries to claim them, and OP hasn't lost them in some other fashion, then he can have them back.  But no guarantees.

Hey, if you are in the US, set up Coinbase with referral links, and then you'll get an extra $5 worth of Bitcoins once they buy $100 worth.
There's some cool math here:  If you sign up on a referral link, and buy $100 worth, you get an extra $5 worth of Bitcoins.  Then if you refer 5 friends who do the same, you get $25 more bitcoins.  So you have $130 worth of Bitcoin. 
On January 1, 2013, Bitcoins sold for $13, and now sell for $860 or so.  Not that the past can predict the future, but (big) IF that happens again, your $130 worth of bitcoins (which you paid $100 for) could grow to $8600.   (Cool math that $130 is 10x the 1/1/13 price, making for easy visualization of the potential.)
So, one signup on a referral link, plus 5 referrals, plus $100, and you have $130 worth of Bitcoins for $100.   If you want, take out the $100, and play with "house money".  
We (Americans) should all be abusing the hell out of those referral links!

In another question, someone asked why 21M.
Any arbitrary number would work, although you want the number of individual units (satoshis) to be big enough to support all potential uses.  
My theory is that an early design had 32-bit integers, (whose highest value is roughly 2.1B), and that his early design had just two decimal places, which nearly consumes the positive 32-bit integers exactly.
Then when he went to 64-bit integers, (my theory says...) he stuck with the same design because of all the symmetry.  210,000 blocks is approximately 4 years at the 10-minute rate.  2016 is two weeks (I wish this was 2100 blocks before each block adjustment, for more symmetry).
Ultimately, it's just "designer's choice".  It is appearing that these were pretty good choices.  He may have gotten quicker adoption if he rewarded the first movers a little more, but then again, maybe not.

I don't know if you were around for the Pet Rock craze.  I was.  One company came out with the Pet Rock.  Then there were some imitators, of course.  But there was only one Pet Rock.  It wasn't something "so easy to obtain" in that you couldn't go out to the stream and pick up a rock and call it a pet rock.  You needed to buy the original - packaging and all.  There was significant value of the original over any imitators.
The value was the joke.  If you gave it to a co-worker as a gift, it was a gag gift.  And it had value.  And people willingly paid for that.  If you gave them "Rock in a Box" as opposed to the original "Pet Rock", it really wasn't the same.
But fads come and go.
I am not saying that the marketers of Dogecoin aren't geniuses, or trying to discredit their accomplishments.  If you can have people willingly hand over money for your product, and be happy with their purchase, then you deserve all the rewards of your entrepreneurship.  The Pet Rock guy did that.  I have a Pet Rock, and when it was bought, it was purchased willingly and the purchaser was happy with the purchase.
But in the end, it's just a rock in a box.  It might actually have some collector value at this point, and the same may be for Dogecoin in the end.  But anyone who buys Dogecoin should understand what they are buying.

You are on the right track.  Don't listen to the advice to install Electrum - that's certainly an option, but is one more complication, not a simplification.  
You don't need diceware.  You can simply use bitaddress, and have it auto-generate a wallet.  But if you don't want to trust its random number generator, you can go to the Wallet Details tab, and simply enter 99 dice rolls (roll 3 dice, 33 times), entering the digits 0-5 (if you roll a 6, type 0).  So you'll key in 99 digits from zero to five.  Then generate the wallet.
Then you'll have a truly random key, and bitaddress will, in an offline fashion, generate a paper wallet.
You can open bitaddress and then disconnect from the web.  And then do the dice thing, and after printing or copying your info, power off before reconnecting, and you should be fine.  Even that is an overkill for most people.

"Bitcoin is more expensive than gold" is a headline/sound bite for the media.  You are correct that it is meaningless, except for the meaning that is given to it by people who haven't thought it through.  
And since the market acts based on how people think, whether rational or not, this has meaning.  (If that makes any sense.)
In other words, if some uninformed people who have Bitcoins think "I saw on CNBC this morning that bitcoin is more valuable than gold.  There's no way bitcoin is more valuable than gold; I'm selling all", then the whole meme has meaning.

Or, think of the Bitcoin economy as a large flywheel.  Once it's spinning, it will be a very useful tool.  It can drive a lot of power, and can easily gain momentum with a small push.  But somehow you have to start it spinning.  And that's what this does.
Sure, it takes extra work and expense and is less efficient in the early stage.   But if you believe in the benefit of the flywheel, you are willing to exert this extra effort.

I think the graph is a little misleading, because it intermixes two different concepts.  One is the overall "big picture" trend (where you go from smart money to Institutional Investors, and so on, over the course of many years).  The other is the micro-bubble tendencies (where each time we have a hype period, it pops, comes back down and bounces).
[I tried to show what I mean here]( basically showing a series of those micro-bubble tendencies as we trace the big picture tendency.
I have no idea whether I am depicting this correctly - only time will tell.  These charts are really only good in hindsight (to map them to actual numbers).  But we are still VERY early in the big-picture.

One technique is called SPV.
The concept is to query servers (or full nodes) asking about specific bitcoin addresses that you control.  But it can be done cleverly (and securely) by specifying a "bloom filter", saying basically to provide information about any bitcoin addresses that, when you perform certain math on them, end up not getting filtered out.
That way, you are requesting information about a bunch of addresses, but the server (or middleman spy / NSA) doesn't REALLY know which addresses you are asking about.   You can throw away the information that you don't care about.
Full nodes or servers reply back with the information about those addresses.  You essentially need to know about unspent outputs, so you can potentially spend them by signing transactions referencing them.

I wouldn't give this advice to friends!  You have no idea what will happen.
Stick to the "it seems to be gaining traction, and as long as that continues, I think it'll be a good investment, but you can never tell.  Only invest what you are willing to lose in its entirety".
If you think logically about how this will play out, you can expect an ultimate "leveling off" of interest at *some* point, whether that be at Bitcoin's current interest level, or at 7 Billion people interested, or somewhere in between.  
When the adoption curve switches from hyper-growth to moderate growth, there will probably be a major correction in price, as people's expectations will be the gaudy 5000% annual price increases, and it'll be obvious that this cannot be sustained.  Then the late-comers will be pissed and disillusioned.

I disagree on all counts.
1.  The taxing of awards of non-cash items is well documented in the US.     
2.  Giving a gift-card instead of cash is often preferred by companies, for the same reason that you don't hand your spouse cash for an anniversary gift.   Handing a bitcoin paper wallet is a gift that can be used to purchase merchandise (from electronics to gyft cards), cashed in (by exchanging for fiat), or saved.  An ideal gift for a tech company who is trying to get their employees more savvy about an up-and-coming technology.    
3.  I can't easily transmit fiat to an employee at an awards banquet.  What, hand them $500 in bills?  Not cool. (Instead, I have to include it in their paycheck)   Handing a paper wallet?  Much better and safer.

I'm not sure how you arrived at that seemingly random number.  I have a friend who, no matter what the price, continually said "it's just too expensive.  I'm going to wait until it's about half of where it is now."  And I'm talking about when it was $2.  He said it again at $5.  He said it at $12.  Again at $20, and so on.  He never did buy in, and he could have had them at $2.
Many people who have studied the technology say that it is break-through, that it's foundational, and that it's here to stay.  So what makes a good price?
It seems like the Bitcoin price will be surrounded by cycles of hype followed by crashes.  It certainly has been for the past several years, with each hype cycle taking the price to higher lows each time.  We just got out of a run-up from about $110 (October 4) to $1200 (Nov 29).  
My recommendation: If you believe in the technology, buy in, but consider buying in over a 5-6 month period.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with today's price, if you believe in the long-term viability.  But these peaks seem to happen every 7 months or so, and we're just exiting one.

Your Bitcoin address is a hash of the public key, which is derived from the private key.  
Both the private key and the public key are kept secret when you advertise your bitcoin address.   You can receive as many funds as you want at that Bitcoin Address, without revealing either your public or private key.
But when you spend money, your public key is revealed in the spend transaction.  This makes your private key one GIANT step closer to being able to be hacked.
Note, there's still another GIANT step, so it's not that risky at this time.  However, it's believed that Quantum computers will be able to take that second giant step, and crack private keys of addresses which have been spent from.

You may want to vary your method depending on your objective.
You could hide your coins in plain sight with randomness.  Like, use the cents digits of the closing price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the first 100 days of 1974.  Or every 164th digit of pi, for 122 digits.  Or the six most significant digits of GPS coordinates of the twenty highest points in the U.S.  In these cases, there's no need to bury anything.
But if your mission is to create a buried treasure, so that the finder knows that they have something of value (especially family), then your methods should be different.  Like print on it "this is a Private Key.  Here's how you decode it."
Edit:  Damn, I just gave up the combination to my luggage.

It's not hard to do the math.
If it catches on, and ultimately 300 million people use it for online purchases, generally holding $100 worth on average, then the total of all bitcoins = 300 M people x $100 = $30 Billion.  With only 21 Million coins, each one would by definition be worth $1428.
Likewise, if 500 M people use Bitcoins for savings, saving on average $5000 each, that's $2.5 Trillion, or $119K each bitcoin, by definition.
Or they go to zero.

And this can be contrasted with running a "light client" or a "Web wallet".  Light clients, like Electrum, are much faster to get started (no need to download the blockchain).  Web wallets generally are riskier (as you are trusting someone else with your money), although some (like blockchain.info) have interesting security models whereby they have built the system so that you don't need to trust them (if you trust that they have built it like that).

I think it's way more common in late 2013 for someone to put $5000 or $10,000 or even up to $100,000 into Bitcoin than back in 2011.
Based on friends of mine who invested, in 2011, a few people took a flyer on it for $1000 and less.   One (out of about ten) threw $5000 at it. 
On the other hand, in January-March 2013, I know several who threw $2000 - $5000 at it, with one tossing in $50,000.  (In early 2013, it wasn't that easy to invest $50,000 in Bitcoin.)

Take a careful look at your pricing strategy.  Consider zero fees to start with (a la BTC China), to get market share.  Or consider the other clever strategy, where limit orders are free (or actually negative charge), while market orders cost fees.  Then you'll have a healthy order book.

I realize that.  I was trying to say that high price facilitates higher possible transactions.  Pick a different number if you want - say $70 Million.
Right now, select users (specifically, the US Government, the Winklevosses, and Satoshi, and perhaps just a few others) could transfer $70 Million to someone else.  They could buy a $70M company if they wanted to.
No Mt Gox exchange is necessary for this.  No price movement.  Nothing.  Simply a transfer of Bitcoins in exchange for a transfer of ownership of the 70M company.  And this wasn't possible a year ago.  It's the high price of Bitcoin that makes this possible now.

This is all open source, and all users can decide what software they want to run.  Any changes that are made to the software must be compatible with the existing users, or it won't work - it will be rejected by the majority.
Some major changes get implemented over time, so that the number of users who are running the change can ramp up over time.

Read up on Mt. Gox before you sell there.  I think "a few weeks" is highly optimistic.  Personally, I would use coinbase (if US) or Bitstamp.
Depending on the amount of Bitcoins you are selling, you really don't need to do everything that you are doing.  You can directly import your private key to the exchange, and "sweep" the account (Mt. Gox allows you to do this).  Then sell what you want to sell, and pay the rest to another paper wallet.
But if you are only selling a small amount of a large fortune, then I would suggest that your method is pretty decent.  
Set up Electrum on a machine that's never been on the net - keep it offline.  Set up Electrum on another machine that has been on the net.  Then import your private keys to the offline system, and create a transaction that pays your Exchange bitcoin address (the amount you want to sell) on the internet machine, and move it by USB to the offline machine and sign it.  Then move it back and it'll execute.  
Then sell your coins.  Then, if you want to go paper again, create another transaction and pay all of them to the paper wallet.  OR, simply keep them on Electrum, offline, and you have your 12-word phrase protecting them.

He has also been very open about the potential risks (that he could get shut down for a number of reasons, and that you are having to trust him in multiple ways - that he won't cheat, nor run off with the money).  He's put some safeguards in place (such as cold wallet, emergency addresses to send you your money back, etc).
But also consider that he has not revealed who he is  (this is a pro and a con - he's less likely to get shut down, but he's also not as "trustworthy" if you don't know the man behind the id).
I personally trusted him with quite a bit of coins, until I decided that my heart couldn't take the variance.

As bad of a rap as Brain Wallets get, I actually think you can create one with enough entropy that it would be impossible to guess, and you could carry the clues with you.
You can create a one sentence clue that only you (or your close family) know.  Then you can carry the clue with you.  For example, here's a clue to a pass phrase for a brain wallet: "Take all the First and Last Names of my 6 college roommates, alphabetize those as 12 separate words, and separate them each with an equal sign.  Append my Social Security Number immediately after the last name, and include dashes in the Social Security Number".  That clue is something you can recreate, and even store it online if you want, and probably no one else in the world could guess that pass phrase, even with the clue.  (Note, don't say "This is a clue to my bitcoin passphrase" because then they can attack it with a names database.)
  
Then, if you want to print out the private key, and leave it with a trusted person, you *could* do that, but no need, unless you die.  Perhaps use  to split the private key into multiple parts so that 3 of 5 pieces are required to rebuild it.

No, this has nothing to do with people replacing lost coins.  Sell orders would instantly be unexecutable.  You can't sell what you don't have.  And when the order book is thinned out, routine market buy orders will drive the price higher on a thin order book.
a) exchanges have been robbed before.  So have Banks.  Banks have been destroyed before.  And filed bankruptcy.  But this has little to do with the confidence of the currency - it has to do with the confidence of the bank.

But nobody wants dollars.  (stay with me here.)
The only reason people want dollars is because they can get *other stuff* with them.  Dollars themselves are worthless. 
Guess what.  So are bitcoins.  But you can get an increasing amount of things with bitcoins (including buying dollars), but it's the *other stuff* that people are interested in.  And it's the *other stuff* that is the reason people might want to accept bitcoins.
Right now I can buy many more things in the US with  bitcoins than I can with Euros.  No one doubts the value of Euros, but they are a bit inconvenient to accept in the US, because you really can't spend them.  
Being "backed by" something means that you can directly swap the item for a fixed amount of it.  When dollars were backed by gold, there was a fixed (not floating) exchange rate, guaranteed by the federal government.  In that sense, Bitcoins aren't backed by anything.

miners.  
Each miner is trying to pick a number to plug into the equation that takes transactions and "locks them in place".  And, although the popular media makes it sound like these are complex computers solving complex math problems, really they are on a search for a number.  They guess a number (the nonce), try it in the algorithm, see that it fails to produce a small enough result, and repeat.  It's searching for a needle in a haystack.
You can actually estimate how many guesses a computer has performed, simply by asking for their best result.  This is how mining pools pay out.  You report in your best result, and the pool owner estimates how much work you have performed, and they pay you for it, even if you never solved a block.

It is free to come up with a 256-bit private key and convert it to a Bitcoin Address.  In fact, you can go to  and get one for free.  There's no charge to be a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Anyone can accept bitcoin without a single fee.
So Bitcoin (lower case "c") is not "completely closed off" to anyone.  Of course, you have to DO SOMETHING to get bitcoin (perform work, sell a product, sell fiat, beg for it, rob someone, etc.), but this is absolutely no different than any other money.  With your logic, dollars are completely closed off to everyone, because they need to do something to get them.  Nope.

But hey, right now, you are comparing full grown adult currencies to an infant.  Sure, it has potential, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Quoting  :
A digital signature is basically a way to ensure that an electronic document (e-mail, spreadsheet, text file, etc.) is authentic. Authentic means that you know who created the document and you know that it has not been altered in any way since that person created it.
Digital signatures rely on certain types of encryption to ensure authentication. Encryption is the process of taking all the data that one computer is sending to another and encoding it into a form that only the other computer will be able to decode. Authentication is the process of verifying that information is coming from a trusted source. These two processes work hand in hand for digital signatures.
There are several ways to authenticate a person or information on a computer:
Public key encryption - Public key encryption uses a combination of a private key and a public key. The private key is known only to your computer while the public key is given by your computer to any computer that wants to communicate securely with it. To decode an encrypted message, a computer must use the public key provided by the originating computer and it's own private key.
The key is based on a hash value. This is a value that is computed from a base input number using a hashing algorithm. The important thing about a hash value is that it is nearly impossible to derive the original input number without knowing the data used to create the hash value. 
Here's a simple example:      
Input number 10667     
Hashing Algorithm = Input # x 143     
Hash Value = 1525381    
You can see how hard it would be to determine that the value of 1525381 came from the multiplication of 10667 and 143. But if you knew that the multiplier was 143, then it would be very easy to calculate the value of 10667. Public key encryption is much more complex than this example but that is the basic idea. Public keys generally use complex algorithms and very large hash values for encrypting: 40-bit or even 128-bit numbers. A 128-bit number has a possible 2^128 different combinations. That's as many combinations as there are water molecules in 2.7 million olympic size swimming pools. Even the tiniest water droplet you can image has billions and billions of water molecules in it!
Electronic payment could become the future of currency.

You can get a little more of a bell-shaped curve by adding 2 random numbers (and then multiplying by half the value that you are multiplying by).  Example:

Back in 2011, when there was some question about Mt. Gox after their hack, the owner of Gox (who I believe was Magical Tux at the time, Mark Karpeles), proved that he had control of the cold storage wallet.
It didn't really prove that it wasn't fractional reserve.  It proved that he had control of a shit-ton of Bitcoins (at the time). 
I don't think such proof has been done since then.  You'd almost have to account for each account, so each person could see *their* amount.

Don't waste your money.
If it's the educational experience you are looking for, then mine Test coins or alt coins.
But if you want to teach, consider showing them [APIs for Bitcoin]( and how they can programmatically send and receive money.  Also APIs for exchanges.
So many learning opportunities outside of mining.  Mining is boring. Sounds exciting ("print money!  Woo hoo!") but it's really not.
Lesson 1 should be: who would sell you a machine that prints money for any less than the amount of money it's expected to print?

Note that the paper wallet puts you in control (and takes coinbase out of the loop).  So if you lose your paper, you are hosed.  They can't help you.
Still, this is the best EASY thing to do.   There are harder things  (like printing your own paper wallet from  and sending the coins to that.... which isn't too much harder, or setting up Armory or Electrum, which is a bit more difficult).

So, think about this:  We all know for a fact now that the NSA is into corrupting secure products with backdoors.  Time to "think like a criminal here..."
If you were the NSA, how, exactly, would you corrupt Bitcoin?  What sorts of things would you do?
It seems that they may want to have a multi-pronged approach.  One would be aimed at compromising any anonymity.  Another would be to have a way to shut down bitcoin if it threatened the world financial system.
So, you infiltrate the dev team and the foundation, by creating a credible contributor to the key bitcoin open source projects and efforts, and have him build a reputation of writing good, solid code.  Maybe create a false persona of a great basement coder (who might also be active on blogs and forums), when in fact, it's a team of people - some writing great code, others working the angle of the public face of this contributor.   You might even build up a persona that no one would suspect might be an NSA shill...  maybe a Chinese person or some other non-US nationality.
This approach could attack bitcoin-QT, third-party wallets, mining software, etc.  You might even attack the mining equipment, and create mining chips with a backdoor that allows you to shut down all mining with a single command.
This might be one individual or many... 
You also confiscate a lot of Bitcoin (SR bust), and make sure you can over-power the network if need be.  Maybe create a mining pool. 
So, all kidding aside, we need to put on those tinfoil hats, and be suspicious of everyone.  Especially those that you'd least suspect.  Which one of these guys looks least likely to be with the NSA... suspect him the most:   Gavin, Mike Hearn, Yifu Guo, the Lee brothers, Luke-Jr, Amir Taaki (the perfect cover!), Roger Ver, Stephen Gornick, etc.   
This could be an interesting witch hunt!  :)  It's fun to try to imagine what the NSA is up to.  You'd be kidding yourself if you think they're up to nothing!

Bitcoin has periods of hype when it gets overheated and peaks, and then periods of non-hype when it just sort of moves sideways.  You are 15 days after a peak.  I think you'd be crazy to plunk it all in at once.

Taking issue with a few:






You describe a feature of INFLATION (the fact that more coins are created, even if at a decreasing rate.  This is inflation.)  Bitcoin is actually designed to be inflationary for quite a while, and then (as currently implemented) will level off to be neither systematically inflationary nor deflationary - rather, there will be a fixed supply.  It's the losing of coins that causes deflation, not the systematic design!








Certainly the person who wrote the paper knows for sure.  So to say **no one** knows is just plain wrong.  And only Siths talk in absolutes.








They verify transactions and add them to the public record
No, full nodes perform the verification step and reject any transactions that are not consistent with the protocol or which look like a double-spend.  Miners perform **confirmation** not verification, although in a loose (non-technical) term, you could (inaccurately) call that verification.  Many miners are not full nodes (those in a mining pool, for example), and therefore do not verify any transactions.  They merely (attempt to) confirm the transactions that they are given.

Forget about the dollar and the bitcoin for a second.  Let's look at something completely different.   Let's say you had two different options:
Scenario D:     
Roulette table at a casino.  With every spin, you place a chip on red and on black.  Usually red or black comes up, and so you receive your money back.  But on average, 2 out of every 38 spins, green (0 or 00) comes up, and you lose your bet.  Then you need to put new money on the table for the next bet.
Slowly your money erodes away, but it's pretty predictable.
Scenario B:     
Again, you are at a roulette table.  This time there is a gambler that consistently has chips on red, even, and 1-12.  Sometimes he wins big.  Sometimes he loses big.  Sometimes it's about breakeven.  
But in this scenario, you are the house.  So your expected return over the long haul is positive.
Scenario D has a lower variance, but a negative expected return.  Scenario B has a higher variance (is more volatile) but a positive expected return.
Which is a better store of value?  I contend that the answer is the one with the positive expected return.  Therefore stability, while "kind of important" (your words), does not mean that stability is the only factor in determining a better store of value.

In order to accept a transaction, you need to know the information about the block that "funded" the spender, and you need to know about every block from then on, to ensure that the money hasn't been previously spent.
You can get just that needed information, not the whole blockchain, and you can trust it because of Merkle Trees.  You don't need the whole blockchain, if you can verify that the pieces you have are valid through the magic of Merkle.

I agree with most of what you said.  But I do think it's possible to peg prices of fiat currency to Bitcoin.  This is fantasy-land stuff (in that it will never happen), but in theory, just as the fed manipulates the dollar by printing more, they could manipulate the dollar by pegging it to the bitcoin (which, in effect, pegs bitcoin to the dollar).
Look at it this way:   For years, we had a gold standard.  You could, at any point, convert dollars for a fixed amount of gold.  That same thing could be done with Bitcoin.
The US Government (or some other government) could buy up bitcoins and put them into reserve (Ft. Knox), and then peg the dollar to the Bitcoin.  They could take all the seized Silkroad coins, and say "OK, now every dollar is worth a satoshi" (or whatever math worked out, so that the amount of dollars circulated equaled the amount of Bitcoin on reserve).
They COULD do that.  It was done in the past, with gold.  Will it happen?  Highly unlikely.  And it still doesn't avoid the issue of politicians who like to print more money than they should.

You do not want to get mining equipment, because it will not pay for itself.  Who would sell you a money-printing machine for less than the money they could generate from it?
Bitcoin a scam?  no.  Investing in mining equipment a bad deal?  Yes.  
If you want to "play with" mining, do it on your PC there, try it for 20 minutes, and then hang it up.  It's really not all that exciting, and it is definitely not worth investing in.

It was possible to become a millionaire without being an "early adopter" simply by putting less than $20K into Bitcoins as recently as ten months ago.

"so expensive" makes little sense.  Ask him if he looked at the price of the last Mutual Fund he bought.   The net asset value of one is $20.45 and another is $89.67.  Is one a better investment than the other?
Also, have him ease a little money into the market at a time.  Start by getting him signed up at Coinbase or an exchange - the process takes some time.
There are limits too, which might help ease him in.  Have him buy 10 at Coinbase (so $4K worth), which might get his feet wet.
Also, forget about trading.  This is a "buy for 2 years" investment.  It's hard to "daytrade" Bitcoins and make any money.  bid/ask spread and commissions make it a losing proposition 53% of the time.

No, this is called miner's fallacy.
I tried to be very clear.  Buying a mining machine is just buying Bitcoins over time.  You would be paying $600 - $1000 for approximately 0.285 Bitcoins, when you can buy many more now for that same $600 - $1000 (2 to 3 times as many!)
In both cases, you will benefit from the rise in Bitcoin prices.

Well... this is where it gets confusing, because a 256-bit private key can store a satoshi or 21M Bitcoins.  Plus a private key can be stored on disk, on paper, in your brain, etc., which all have different physical properties, and different numbers of electrons.
But is a bitcoin really the private key?  I contend not.  A bitcoin is a ledger entry, and really can't effectively be spent without someone having the entire ledger (currently) or the ledger of unspent outputs with appropriate merkle verification (in the future with blockchain reduction).
The entire ledger is [currently 12.571 MB]( and represents [12.151 M BTC](  **EDIT see correction in reply below.  I'm off by a factor of 1000 from here to the end of the message, since I said 12.571 MB instead of 12,571 MB (12.571 GB).**
In experiments (and contrary to what you might expect), scientists were able to store [35 bits per electron]( in extreme examples of density - which is a couple of orders of magnitude different from your estimate of 100 electrons per bit.  However, given that the blockchain is not practically stored in Quantum Holograms, we'll go with your estimate of 100 electrons per bit.
So, the entire blockchain is about 12.5 MB, which is about 100 Megabits, which would take about 10 Billion electrons.  We're not really accounting for redundancy and indexing here, but that's ok for government work.
10 Billion electrons is 10^9.  So, with each electron weighing 3.2 x 10^-29 ounces, the entire blockchain weighs 3.2 x 10^-20 ounces.  Since this weight represents 12.1 x 10^6 Bitcoins, you could argue either that:
a) any amount of bitcoins, whether it be 1 satoshi or 21M BTC weighs 3.2 x 10^-20 ounces currently (which is the weight of the blockchain stored once), or
b) the pro rata weight of any one bitcoin is the total weight of all bitcoins, 3.2 x 10^-20 ounces, divided by the 1.2 x 10^7 bitcoins in existence.  So 1 BTC weighs 2.7 x 10^-27 ounces.
Wow.  That was a lot of meaningless math.

["foul swoop"?](  lol
One idea would be to create a transaction that moves your bitcoins to another address that you control, with a large fee, but don't broadcast the transaction.  Then write a listener program that listens for a spend from your account.  If it sees a spend, it instantly broadcasts your high-fee double-spend.  You MAY be able to "lock" your coins that way, such that the only way they could be spend is if you disable your watcher program.
You'll still get shot by the guy with the gun to your head though.

You are totally missing my (and Bruce's) point.
I am "heavily misquoting Bruce" when I quote him directly.  The first statement in the article was **copied and pasted** so it's far from "heavily misquoting" him.
I'm not sure why you have this blind spot.  Of course, Open source has proven to be better than closed source, for reasons best articulated with Linus' Law.  (Ironically, you claim the benefits of Open Source, but then bash Wikipedia which is one of the best real-life non-code examples of Linus' Law.)
Do you understand what security layering is?  If you don't understand that, then you should go research that.
If you do understand that, then you understand that the fundamental, unchallenged, well-documented, widely-believed, studied principles of layered security is that adding a positive layer of security increases the overall security.
Obscurity is a positive layer of security.  Therefore, by all accounts of anyone who knows anything about security, security after the layer MUST BE, IS, WILL BE stronger than prior to the addition of the layer.
If you take an encrypted wallet file, zip it, change the file name to .jpg, it MUST BE, IS, WILL BE more secure than the encrypted wallet file alone.
If you can't see this, you really need to take a course in basic security.
A bank is more secure with a security guard and a camera than just a camera alone.  Duh.

I think it's actually just ever so slightly worse than you think, because you did the math wrong.
If the amount that came out of your bank was 706.57 (confirm this!), then the math should look like this:
(A) 706.57 = amount of bank withdrawal     
(B) 0.15 = amount coinbase charges for bank fee (according to you.  I didn't verify)      
(C) 706.42 = (A-B)     
(D) 1% = coinbase fee     
(E) 699.425743 = (C / (1+D))      
(F) .89556426 = amount of BTC received (per you)     
(G) 780.988896 = price per BTC = E / F     
It's possible that your bank hit you with another fee.     
Note that you messed up step E.
Working the other way, if you bought .89556426 BTC @ $780.988896 per BTC, then you can do the math working up the chart.  Note how the difference between C and E is exactly 1% of E (not of C!)
So, I suspect that today's Coinbase price was 780.988896 (or maybe 780.99), which is consistent with at least one price from today (on Bitstamp, today's high was 790)

well, there are a million nobodies mining now.  There are at least 450,000 accounts on BTCguild alone.  It's certainly a concern that they tend to join mining pools and converge into centralized groups.
The interesting dynamics of this are that the pool operators can make a lot of money for a long time running a pool, provided that the currency doesn't lose its stability and security.  So the pool owners have a long term incentive to be honest and not approach 51%.  Meanwhile, the individuals can quickly switch pools if necessary.
It's not an unfounded concern though.  I would fear a powerful agency who wanted to bring down Bitcoin taking over the top two pools by force.  That would be very bad.

Any time there are congressmen in hearings, they make a record of the event, and they leave the record open for a number of days.  This gives the politicians a chance to amend what they "officially" say - especially useful for gross errors or items that may have been misinterpreted.
Near the end of one of the sessions, the person holding the hearings basically said what they say during many of these sessions - that the record would be kept open for comments and corrections for x days.  I think it was 15 days.
Nothing sinister or unusual in that - it's part of the standard congressional process, so that the congressional advisers can make the politician look a little smarter, with time to amend remarks.

Think of 21 Million as the limit.  Each time you get halfway closer to the limit, you cut the production rate in half.
So when we got to 10.5M, the block reward went from 50/block to 25/block.  When we get halfway closer (15.75M), it'll cut to 12.5/block.
So you never reach 21M, even if the precision is extended.

Really, to be totally safe, do 4 and 5 FIRST, and save bitaddress.org as a file on a USB , and then once you have a Linux system booted, just never connect it to the internet, and use the bitaddress.org that you previously saved.  
The idea is to have your system never touch the internet (assuming you are ultra-paranoid).

Blockchain.info has an interesting security model.  Unlike Coinbase, they technically don't store your coins and don't know your password.  
Instead, your credentials are used to decrypt access to your keys, and it's all done in your browser.  So, if it's working, then it's probably the most secure of all sites, since they aren't taking control of your coins and trying to store them.  
But still, it's an attack point.  If a hacker aimed at blockchain.info and was able to take over their site, they could cause problems for logged-in users.  And if you backup your wallet to your email, there's a potential point of attack there.  And if a key-logger takes over your PC, there's a potential point of attack there.  And if you use a non-secure password or passphrase, there's a potential point of attack there.
blockchain.info is a really good security model, and I use it all the time for quick exchanges.  But for my "savings account", it's safely tucked away in a few paper wallets.  You can SEE it on blockchain.info (watch only), but no one can spend it.  My private keys have never touched the internet (unlike Blockchain.info's).
So, I'd rate them highly, but putting bitcoins on paper is so easy, it seems silly not to.

There are special mathematical properties that link 3 numbers together:
Private Key --&gt; Public Key --&gt; Bitcoin Address
You can easily derive the Bitcoin Address from the Public Key, and the Public Key from the Private Key, but you can't easily go the other way.
But one of the properties of these numbers is that you can PROVE that you have the private key by doing some math using the Private Key on a transaction, and then people can confirm that you have the Private Key using the Public Key.  And they can confirm that the Public Key is linked to the Bitcoin Address.

I think you are confused.
Bitcoins are an abstract concept.  You can't point at a number and say "that's a bitcoin".
The number is the private key that can unlock bitcoins.  It can lock a small amount (.00000001 bitcoins) or a large amount (21,000,000 Bitcoins).   Kinda sorta like your bank account number and pin can unlock a penny or a million dollars.
The bitcoin amount is a 64-bit integer value, representing the number of satoshis in the transaction, a satoshi being 0.00000001 Bitcoins.  So all transactions are in the range of 0.00000001 to 21,000,000.00000000, with that level of precision, stored as integers (ranging from 1 to 2,100,000,000,000,000).

Great idea, but what is even better is to use the wallet details tab with dice.  bitaddress.org has provisions for that, called Base-6 or B6 format.
You simply roll 3 6-sided dice 33 times, and enter the results into the area that says "Enter Private Key", where each digit should range from 0 to 5 (so if you roll a 6, type 0).
99-digit totally random keys are as good as you can get, it's the right amount of entropy, and the code is very short to review that part.

@_date: 2013-11-15 05:10:59
He'd have a valid point if Bitcoins were worth nothing.  But as soon as the market value of Bitcoins is non-zero, his point collapses.
Even if Bitcoin has just a hint of a value - even if a bitcoin is just worth a millionth of a penny - his argument collapses.  Because his whole argument is based on the fact that 0/2 = 0.   And a millionth of a penny divided by two is a half of a millionth of a penny.
So, the question is, is there ANY value in the ability to send value directly to nearly anyone, nearly instantly, nearly free?  And the market says that's valued at significantly more than a millionth of a penny.
Further, he argues that this same functionality is available with gold.  And that is simply not true.  You need to have someone store your gold.  And so you are trusting a third party.  And then you can send the iou to someone else, sure.  But that is NOT sending Gold.
Sending IOUs is like dollars of old.  And that system is doomed.  Because as soon as the IOU issuer realizes that he can run a fractional reserve system and no one will notice, it will happen.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:51:21
You are absolutely correct, and I am surprised more people aren't pointing that out.
If Bitcoin competes with Western Union - say it gets half of Western Union's business, and gets $40B of annual transfers.  That's about $110M per day in transfers.
And considering that this may mean a purchase at an exchange, a transfer, and a sale (that is, three bitcoin transactions), that could easily be done in an hour or two, but more likely, the average will be similar to the current average spend time of a bitcoin, which is about 6 weeks, as I recall, per transaction.  So effectively 18 weeks for these three transactions.
So that $40B of transfers equates to about $14B of value in Bitcoin market cap.

He's also confused by saying that Gold represents the mining effort.  (The mining effort is a sunk cost - the fact that it cost $1600 an ounce to mine that gold in his hand has ZERO to do with the market value of gold now (which is significantly less than $1600 an ounce).

No, different nodes receive the transactions in different orders.  The set of unconfirmed transactions at "A" may be different than "B" because double-spend attempts will only have the first spend attempt stored by any node (and so it depends on which spend-attempt you heard first)


Actually it's SHA256(sha256(Block))
The miners are performing that work on a block of transactions of their own choosing, based on the collection of unconfirmed transactions.  So, no, not everyone is working on the same collection of data. 
In addition to the collection of transactions to be confirmed, there are several other pieces of information included:  a reference back to the last block, a special "coinbase" transaction which pays the miner the block reward, and a "nonce" which is a number of the miner's choosing.  The trick is to brute-force the nonce, trying one number after another, until you get a small enough hash.


This doesn't validate anything.  It confirms the SEQUENCE of the transactions - a block at a time - so that some order is added to the P2P list of transactions.  You need to know which transactions happened before other ones, and this "locks them into place" in the blockchain.   The reason it does, is because a bunch of work was done to lock them into place, and an equivalent amount of work would need to be done to "un-do" them.


No, miners broadcast the block.  This can quickly be hashed and verified by others to determine whether it meets the requirements for a "solved" block.


Occasionally (more than once per day, I think), multiple chains exist in the network.  Some nodes will have heard about one, while others heard first about the other.  And they start working on trying to solve the next block.  Eventually, one wins out over the other.  If you accepted A1, while A2 was accepted by others, and you are working on the next block (B), but you hear about a B2, you immediately discard A1, and accept A2-B2 chain.
It's possible for these forks to happen that are longer than 1, but very rare that they are as long as 6 (unless there are serious network issues, or coding issues).


Yes, they refer to the block chain in an indexed fashion.  Each "spend" refers to the transaction that funds it, and it's quick.


We have multiple branches because people hear about solved blocks at different times, because it's a network.  Not everyone gets the news simultaneously.  Some hear from one solver, while others may hear from another.


You are looking at advanced diagrams that aren't yet implemented, but are ways to prune the blockchain.
Hashing is one-way math.  They just hash the transaction.  And then they hash the hashes.  It creates a tree that can be used to verify the blockchain, without getting the whole blockchain.
Basically, with the tree, you can verify that a transaction is really in the block chain by being given the transaction and the hashes on the other side of the tree.  So it's a way that people dont need to store the whole chain.
You can read the wikipedia article on Merkle Chains to understand this better.  But I don't think that Merkle chains are fully implemented yet.
The concept is that you don't need the whole blockchain, but only the block headers and the Merkle root.  And then if you need to verify a transaction, you simply need to know where it is in the Merkle Tree, and the has opposite the transaction, and you can confirm its existence. (You can't confirm whether it's been spent yet, but you can confirm that it exists in the tree.)

Well, people thought storing Bitcoins on inputs.io was safe, and they were robbed last week.   Something like 45% of all online wallet services for Bitcoins have been robbed over the years.  So... your call.
Coinbase shows a lot of promise.  They seem to be doing all the right things.  But is SUPER SIMPLE to take control of your own bitcoins, I don't know why you'd want to trust them to strangers.
First, set up 2-factor authentication on Coinbase if you haven't already.  That's mandatory in my book.
Then consider a paper wallet from Coinbase.  But that has risks.
I prefer this:  Go to   Print a paper wallet, and send your bitcoins to the paper wallet.  Then you are done.  Store the paper wallet in multiple places.  If you want to do this in a careful manner, do it in a private browsing session, load the web page, turn off your internet connection, and then generate a few wallets in a row, and print the last one.  Then reboot.
If you want to be really super paranoid, do this all from a fresh operating system that has never touched the internet.  Appropriate for stashes of $50K or greater... But I know people with $500K stashes that don't do this.

2.5 GH/s will generate about 0.002 BTC per day at the current difficulty.  That means you have about a 0.002/3600 chance of solving a block in a given day.  (1 in 1.8M.)
So if there were no difficulty increase, you'd have a 365/1.8M chance (or a 1 in 56K chance).  But with the difficulty changes, I would say it's much worse than 1 in a million.

No one can tell you what will happen.  If the market was convinced it was going to go to $10,000, it would be there now.
But if you ask around and see  how many people know what Bitcoin is, and how many people are using it on a daily basis, I think you'll find it to be a very small percentage.  So the opportunity is huge; whether Bitcoin awareness and usage can grow from where it is now to double or ten times or 100 times what it is, no one knows.
On the other hand, you can do the simple math.  Pick some numbers:  How many people might want to own Bitcoin for daily transactions?  500 Million?  and how much "spare change" might they need for spending, on average?  $100 worth?  And so how much total value is that?  (500M x $100...) $50B?  And $50B spread over a maximum of 21 million coins is what?   ($50B / 21M...)  $2380/Bitcoin.    
You can run those same numbers with different scenarios, and see that the value gets huge fast.  What if 800 M people want to store on average $1000 in Bitcoin?  That's $800 B spread over 21 M coins, or $38000 per coin.

Imagine this:  In order to store a dollar or a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, all you need to do is to store a randomly generated collection of 256 bits - a sequence of 256 "coin flips" or zeros and ones, if you will.
That's it.  It's literally that simple.  You are trying to effectively store your "account number and spending PIN", collectively known as your "Private Key" in the Bitcoin terminology.  
And it's really fairly short, all things considered.  It can be encoded as a string of about 50 characters.  It can be encoded as QR code.  It can be encoded as a pass phrase.  But all of these essentially work out to be 256 bits.
So how do you want to store those?  In your brain?  In a safe?  On paper?  Split up among trusted friends?  etc.
If you click here now:   and give it ten seconds (moving your mouse), you will get a private key.  Print it and store it.  Move your money to the associated Bitcoin Address.  Poof, you are done.  That gets bitcoins off out of someone else's hands and within your sole control.
That level of security is sufficient for the vast majority of people.  For extra security, [there are additional steps]( you can follow.

Evil people are the reason we can't have anything nice.  They would steal bank account information, buy Bitcoins, and transfer the Bitcoins out.  And then coinbase gets stuck holding the bag, when the real account owner finds out.

The current state of the art in brute force / rainbow tables is to use common phrases and hash them once, which is what most people do.  So your method would be safe, until it becomes a common technique.
There are many variations of this.  You can come up with something that is very easy to describe in a few sentences, and it's unlikely to be cracked.  Something like this:
My Brain wallet pass phrase can be created with these instructions:  "Take my full name and the full names of the first ten presidents, capitalizing only the second letter of each name. ASCII-sort these characters."
You could tape this to your PC, or put this in your safe-deposit box, and feel confident that it won't be stolen by anyone overseas.  As you can imagine, there are tons of variations. capitalize the 3rd and 5th letters.  nine presidents.  reverse sort.  etc.

Why would it be the amount of transacting going on as opposed to the amount of merchants?  Or the size of things you can buy?  Or the number of people who are able to transact?
If the value is as a platform for transacting, then measure the platform.  Not how much the platform is used.
The stage at the Opera House is a platform too, but if you were trying to assess its value, would you measure the number of people who use it, or the amount of value that is derived from its use?

I like the Winklevoss comment:  Crypto-currency is likely a "winner-take-all" market.  So, while Litecoin is enjoying the pump-up, riding the coat-tails of Bitcoin as people want to diversify, just in case, Litecoin is inferior to Bitcoin's merchant network, exchange network, tool network, network of developers, network of miners, network of users, and security of the coin.
So, my opinion is that Litecoin is a huge bubble.  Yes, money can be made in Bubbles...  just be careful.

As much as I hate this whole idea, I'm beginning to think it's brilliant.  (hear me out!)  Think about anytime the government wants to regulate something.  If the industry steps forward and proposes self-regulation (like movie ratings, keeping Janet Jackson's clothes on during halftime, video game ratings, banking rules, etc), the government signs off on it, and moves on.  No need to regulate; the industry experts are taking care of it.
So the Bitcoin crew poses a totally non-workable solution.  And it'll probably get signed off on.  And it'll never work.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin will continue to grow and spread, and then it's game over.

Look on the exchange for an import feature, since you have an account there.  If you can't find it:
If I were you, I would go to blockchain.info and create a wallet.  Then go to the advanced features and import that wallet (after agreeing that you are an advanced user and know what you are doing!!)
You will be given an option to sweep the account (which moves the money and may cost you a fee), or directly import the private key.  I personally would choose direct import.   Then you have the money online.  You can pay it to someone, etc.
Also, you could go to coinbase, sign up for an account, and import the private key, and then sell it.
You'll be prompted for your passphrase at import time, by any service that supports BIP38.

ELI**4** version: Bitcoin is a system of electronic cash that you run on your computer without having to trust any central computer, allowing you to send money to anyone else that runs the software.

Naaah, it's not necessarily directly correlated to the number of people buying or selling.  It's correlated to the price they are willing to buy or sell at.
Every sale has one buyer and one seller.

@_date: 2013-11-23 07:55:43
A wallet can have a collection of private keys.  When you import an address (not a "sweep" of the address), it adds the private key to your collection of private keys.
So if you are on Blockchain.info, they give you a bitcoin address to receive funds.  If you import a private key, that imported Bitcoin address does *not* become your receive address.  (You can still receive funds at that address, as long as the private keys are in your wallet, but the address that Blockchain.info shows you as your "receive" address will be a different one.)
People also get messed up with change, when they import their wallet and spend a little. The change will (typically) go to a different address.  So if you have 10 BTC on paper, and imported it to blockchain.info, and then spent 3 BTC, the remaining 7 are no longer on that paper.  They are on blockchain.info, and if you want them on paper, you send them to paper.

3)  Long term storage can be easily accomplished with Paper Wallets.

When you import to blockchain.info, you have two different choices for the import:  sweep or direct import.  Sweep will initiate a transaction which moves the money to another address.  This is good if you think your private key has been compromised.  Unfortunately (but not a huge deal), this can trigger fees.
If you do a direct import, then your private keys is stored into your blockchain.info wallet (added to the other keys).  So the money is still in your paper wallet.
BIP38 paper wallets are almost brand new, so you won't find a lot of documentation.  I am a little nervous about them, being brand new... I remember when bitaddress.org first came out, it was possible to generate an address that you didn't have the right private key for.  So your money would be lost forever!  yikes!  So I am cautious.
But my understanding of BIP38 wallets is that you get what the call a private key, starting with a "6".  But really that's not the true private key.  That's an encrypted private key, and the "real" private key starts with a "5" (in the typical encoding).  So my guess is that blockchain.info would ask you for the passphrase one time, and then store the unencrypted private key.  But I'm not sure.

As others have said, this is really a non-issue.
Here's my theory on the 21M:   first, the original Bitcoin client had 2 decimal digits displayed.  So I suspect 21M was originally 2100M individual units in an early design.  And 2100M is just under the upper limit for a 32-bit number.
Satoshi probably did all the math in his design with 32-bits, liked the symmetry of 21M, and 210,000 blocks before the block reward adjustment, and 2016 blocks before a difficulty adjustment.  And so when he went to 64-bit numbers, he simply extended the precision to 8 decimal places.
So, I think the 21M is a legacy item from an early design.  As it turns out, you can choose almost any positive number to be the upper limit, and the system would work.

The math behind digital signatures ensures that you can prove that you possess the private key by doing some math and revealing your public key.  You never need to reveal your private key.
This is similar to, but contrary to your PIN or your CVC/CVV number on the back of your credit card, that's supposed to "prove that the card is in your possession".  Of course, the first clerk or website that you revealed it to can steal your identity and "prove that the card is in THEIR possession", which is what makes Bitcoin so revolutionary.

it is possible, but to say highly unlikely is a serious understatement, **provided they are selected randomly**.
Think about this:  If you flipped a coin 256 times, and came up with a certain sequence of heads-tails...etc., that same sequence will never be duplicated.  Even if you took all of the computing power in the world and had all computers "flipping coins" fulltime.  It won't happen.
That's the level of protection you have, preventing someone from duplicating your private key.  Protection is less for duplicating the Bitcoin Address, but it's still 160 coin-flips.

The exchange rate is usually the last traded price.  Real people (sometimes in an automated fashion) have fiat and bitcoins on account at the exchange, and put in bids and asks to trade.
These will naturally vary, as different people have different amounts of bitcoins and fiat on the various exchanges.
In addition, different exchanges have different features - such as privacy, ability to get money in and out quickly, levels of volume, etc., which can impact how people fund their accounts.
There are arbitrage opportunities - where you can buy low on one exchange, and then sell high on another.  But it's not as easy as it sounds, because then you have to move the fiat.  The Bitcoins can be moved very quickly.  The fiat movement is slower - Mt. gox Dollars can take months to get moved out.

I think that it's interesting that it's perceived to be a "threat" that someone might take their large holdings and disperse them to many other people who have smaller holdings.  Seems a bit contradictory:  It's a threat that one person has a lot, and the threat is that they could disperse them, which makes it less of a threat...
I understand that the concern is price stability.  Of course, the person with great wealth is highly motivated to ensure stability and confidence for the whole time that he has great Bitcoin wealth, and when he no longer has great Bitcoin wealth, he really isn't able to affect price stability.  So it seems like a shaky concern at best.
It makes sense in a situation where he has more to gain by bitcoin falling apart, but I can't foresee that situation at this point.

I like your concept of buying Bitcoin "rather than just wasting my money like [you] had before on stupid things."  This puts it in the category of money that you can afford to lose.
I like your concept of buying over time, rather than all at once.  Bitcoin will fluctuate, and when it drops, it can drive you nuts if you are all in, and causes many weaker hands to sell.
I would strongly encourage you to have another investment, though.  Don't put all your eggs into the Bitcoin basket.

Based on the information provided, I would conclude that the issue stems from MIUI development version, and would investigate that further.  
Since MIUI is based on Jelly Bean, which was released in July 2012, I think there's a high probability that it has the old Google PRNG code in it.

I should add, the GH/s (Giga Hash per second) measurement that you may have seen, regarding mining equipment reflects how many billions of guesses per second a computer can perform. 
A typical USB miner might be 3 GH/s (3 billion guesses per second), while an ASIC mining machine might be 100 or 500 billion guesses per second.  The whole network is performing about 5 million billion guesses per second.

I think you are right.  $127 was a pretty solid platform and it took some bad news to knock it down.  Once people saw how low it would go with bad news, and how it bounced back, a new solid platform will be established at a higher point.  
My guess is at the $180-$200 level, with occasional fluctuations down as low as $165 or as high as $225.  I figure it could stay in that $180-$200 band for 3 months, and then take off again.

You actually have a good point.  Who can reverse Bitcoin transactions?  Someone with a lot of mining power.
In fact, back in March when there was a fork in the blockchain, several key players joined forces (miners, developers), and reversed a whole fork that was like 26 blocks long.  As it turns out, most of those transactions appeared on both forks, but there was at least one transaction that was only on the bad fork that was un-done (as there was a conflicting double-spend on the main fork).

The thing that has always confused me is the liquidity of gold or silver.  I always wanted to invest, but if the purpose is to get around the whole fiat "IOU" thing, then it seems to me you'd want to order coins or bars or something.

And then to sell it, you'd have to prove that you had the real thing.  That always seemed hard (or that you would never get near a good price for it).

I don't think volatility is keeping it from being mainstream.  I think going mainstream takes time, and to get to be mainstream, it will have a huge value, and getting there is causing volatility.  Huge difference.   The volatility isn't preventing it from being mainstream; on the contrary, the process of going mainstream is causing the volatility.
Coinbase isn't perfect, but it's the best "retail bitcoin shop" the US has.  Just recognize that it's a small company (they hired employee  in June) and don't expect "Charles Schwab" level of service from this tiny company.  And if you buy $5000 worth of Bitcoin and it takes two weeks to get to you, and the price drops in half, don't be mad.  
The first time you buy, buy just a little, and give it time.
The vocal people who complain about Coinbase  are all butt-hurt because they are probably spending too much money (more than they are willing to lose entirely) and are impatient.  Probably looking at it as a get-rich-quick scheme, and are wounded because their money is caught in limbo for a short period as things get sorted out.

I mostly agree with you.
LTC is not in the same position that BTC was in two years ago.  (The position of being the leading crypto-currency in a fledgling market that the general public doesn't know about.)   It's also in a sea of wanna-be's that makes it really pretty worthless.
I'd put the LTC target price at a maximum of .75% of BTC's price.  (maybe it'll get a maximum of 3% market share and there are destined to be four times as many LTC as BTC).   So anything over $8.25 now is a waste of money.   (And I'm unlikely to buy LTC at any price!)

As others have said, you can mine on your CPU if you are interested in mining for the sake of mining.  
If you aren't willing to conduct a transaction, how are you going to obtain a mining machine?  Buy it?  Well hell you are conducting a transaction then.  And you may as well spend that money on Bitcoins.  In the long run, you will end up with FAR more bitcoins that way (along with CPU mining, to experience the thrill of mining / wasting your time).
Right now, if you buy a $1249 Miner, you are likely to get about 1 Bitcoin back, in the lifetime of that miner.  So repeat, you are paying $1249 for a bitcoin (or less!) to be delivered at a future date.  If you spend $1249 on Bitcoins, you will get nearly 2 bitcoins back, immediately.

No.  The exchange price is the price that it exchanges at.  If everyone in the whole world "held" and didn't sell, then there would be no exchange between two people, and you'd see the volume of exchanges drop to zero, while the price remains unchanged.
You might see bids get higher and higher until someone cracked at a price that was too good to be true.  But then that would be contrary to your hypothetical scenario.
There's really a market of sellers and buyers, and people change sentiment all the time, or need fiat for their Christmas shopping or their new car.  But generally, the sentiment is that Bitcoins are a good thing to hold on to.  I suspect that will remain true for a long time, until it suddenly, abruptly becomes not true.

There's a lot wrong with this analysis, as others have pointed out.
I'll just point out a few more (which aren't the best arguments... the best valid arguments have already been made by others).
First, a significant number of the top 100 are businesses.  So there's really no worry there.
Second, if I were someone who had a lot of bitcoins (not saying I am or not), I would plan to hold until much wider market acceptance, and then periodically sell/spend to support my lavish lifestyle or my charitable nature.  It'd be treated like  an annuity, not a dump.

Given that there are an infinite number of possible curves, someone could question any curve drawn.  
I suspect that Satoshi looked at Gold mining cost curves, and adoption curves for various other technologies (phone, PC, facebook, etc), and picked one that he thought provided a reasonable balance between first-mover advantage and ultimately limiting inflation.
Based on reading his messages, it's clear that he thought fixed supply was critical to success.  One option would be to straight-line it - he could have distributed all 21M coins in 4 years (or 40, or 400).  But a tapering curve ("every time we get halfway closer to 21M, we cut the production rate in half") is actually a pretty clever way of doing it.
Mathematically, I would have preferred a smoother curve, so that each block has a slightly reduced reward.  But that would be harder to explain to people.
Side effect:  Company names like "50BTC" are outdated like "20th Century Fox".

But we know that Satoshi kept a PC running, mining during that period.  So assume your PC was equivalent to his, you'd mine roughly half.  And during many periods, Hal Finney was mining, and others.  So in reality, probably the best you could have done for a sustained period was about 10%.
A better question would be "how many did Satoshi mine", and someone has estimated that.  Presumably if you had the same power and diligence as he had, you could have split that with him.  So maybe 500K coins.

miners take groups of transactions (any ones that they choose; typically the ones that pay the fees that they are looking for), and group them together, and pick a number (called a nonce) and do some predefined math, hoping that the answer comes out small enough.  If not, they pick a new number and try again.
So, running your own miner would have to do the same thing.  It doesn't help your transactions happen any faster, unless you happen to solve the block, which is highly unlikely unless you have some very high end mining equipment.

The Bitcoin system is designed to reward miners to keep them interested in mining. Once mining rewards are cut, fees will help make up the difference.  If it becomes financially unrewarding to mine, then fees will increase or miners will drop out to the point where it becomes financially rewarding (since the reward per miner effectively increases when there are less miners).
So, I don't think there's any worry that miners will go away anytime ever.

@_date: 2013-11-24 19:37:15
You are wondering what to do?  I think it's simple.
You are 25.  Say you will live 75 more years.  That's 900 months.  So you can "withdraw" (spend) about .19 BTC per month.  Sure, it's only $150 now.  In ten months (at today's exchange rate), you'll have pulled out your full investment in dollars.  
Knowing Bitcoin's growth rate, you may pull out the entire $1500 in 5 months.  Or a month.  But just spend about .19 BTC per month, and in your 30's you'll have a great time!
Adjust your plan as things change.  If you find out you have a year to live, step up the plan, and make it a hell of a year.  If you are ready to get hit by a bus tomorrow, spend it all today.  (haha)

Doing that will generate less coins than the cost of the electricity to do it.  And you'll beat the hell out of your machine.  And you'll generate some miniscule amount of coins (like under a penny - how much does your electricity cost.  it'll be less than that).  Unless you have free electricity, it's probably not worth it.
So, if you want to do it for grins, go at it.  It gets old fast.  But if you are looking to play with Bitcoins themselves, the more efficient way is simply to buy them.

The Silk Road bust sent the price tumbling from $127 to level off between 110 and 115.  Once it fully recovered, in about 2 weeks to 127 (on about the 15th), it proceeded to shoot to 200 by the end of the month, and 360 in the next 14 days.  So figure 650 by the end of November.  :)

I tried to help a 61 year old sell Bitcoin over the weekend.  What a disaster!
We've talked about Bitcoin for 2 years, and he's one of these "I'll wait until the price drops... seems over-valued" (since 2011!) kind of guy.  So he never bought any.  Well, finally I bought him 1 bitcoin for his retirement gift.  
Seeing that the price was over $600 this weekend (!) he decided he wanted the money for Christmas, and asked for my help selling.  
So, we go on to his inferior PC, which has IE 7 or something.  I tell him to sign up at Coinbase.  Coinbase lets you create an account, but when it gets to the prompt that's supposed to say "go to your email and verify your account", instead, on IE7 or 8 or whatever, it's simply a blank screen with the coinbase header.  Surprise!  Coinbase doesn't support old IE browsers.
So, on to attempt   I tell him to download google chrome.  "Where do I type that in?" (OMG!)  He closes his browser and "starts over", loading IE with a Yahoo home page.  Keys in "google chrome", which brings up an ASK.com page full of fake download pages.  He downloads who-knows-what, but it's not google chrome.
3rd attempt:  me: "go to google".  him:  "how do I do that?"   WTF, this guy's never been to google??  so I get him to google, get him to download chrome, install it, and run it, go back to coinbase, ... ok, now we're on our way!
next, verify your email.  check.  Next verify your phone.  He doesn't have a smart phone!  Yikes.  So we have to verify a land line.  No way to install authy on a land line!  etc.
next, verify your bank.  He doesn't use home banking!  How do these guys live in the 21st century!!!
next, scan in the private key.  Oh, forget that... there's no camera.  no phone with a camera.  So we key in a 51-digit number.  
Still waiting on the verification of the bank, of course.  Fortunately he'll now get more than $600 for his Christmas money.
And he's like "this is so hard, there's no way it'll catch on."

I know you're not supposed to feed trolls, but I'll try to clarify some of your many inaccuracies.


No, it's at just over 12 million.


[This rollout curve]( does not resemble a pyramid at all.  It is closer to the discovery of a precious metal.
The rollout curve was an arbitrary design decision.  No one was prevented from participating from the start.  A couple of alternatives - dump them all on the market at once, or have them released to the market infinitely - don't fit with the objectives of fairly rewarding those who are performing the accounting function for the payment system.


Yeah, if you are tainted by the jealousy of not being an early adopter, by all means, don't examine the technology.  (eye roll).


When I got an email address, I wanted people to get email addresses so I could communicate with them.  That, too, was a pyramid scheme by your definition, because the early adopters saw the value and wanted others to participate, which would increase their own value.  Participation was not without cost.  Yet you had to talk people into spending their money to be able to benefit.  I don't really have a problem with that.
Guess what:  Almost everything of value starts out with a small group of people owning it, and a wider group of people owning it later, and the small group benefits from their early investment.  OMG Toyota Corollas are a pyramid scheme, because the Toyota dealer is trying to convince you to invest in it!!!!  He's going to benefit, and so is his boss, and the entire Toyota corporation, and the founder is laughing himself to the bank.

Users lost their bitcoins.  
If they moved their coins to cold storage (paper wallet, for example), then they were no longer users.

Personally, I am bullish on Bitcoin for 2014.  So I am holding.  But I'll give you some advice.  Really think hard about this, and consider whether you are ready to lose half of your wealth - like, what if it goes to zero.  Can you handle that?
Past performance of Bitcoin is NOT an indication of what will happen in the future.  But presumably you've taken a look at how the value of all bitcoins has risen over time.  And presumably, you are thinking that it is likely to continue, somewhat, into the future.
If you study the charts, you will see that Bitcoin (in the past!) has gone through cycles of hype and non-hype.  During the hype, the price rises rapidly.  During non-hype, it is pretty steadily, but mildly dropping.  So very steep hills up, bumpy, but gradual rides down.  (Look at the chart on a LOG graph!)
And right now, we are a couple of weeks into the nice mild ride down.  It started at about Thanksgiving.
By the way, in the past, the rides up tend to be between 52 and 79 days, and the rides down tend to be between 142 and 170 days.  So we are 14 days into what could be a 150 day trend sideways / downward.  Granted, we've already fallen quite a bit from the peak (~$1240), but we are nowhere near the last peak ($266 at April 9 or 10).
Given the past cycles, and with full knowledge that the past is not a perfect predictor of the future, I think you should space your purchases over the next 4-5 months.  If you are serious about investing 50% of your savings, put 10% to 12% in per month (or 2.5% - 3% per week).  Don't drop 50% in today; you'll go crazy.

There is no reporting requirement that the company reveal the Bitcoin Address to the IRS.  Likewise, there is no reporting requirement that the company reveal the bank account that they pay to.
For audit purposes, though, the company would typically keep records of payment transactions, which may include that information.  And in an audit, I imagine it could be requested and reviewed.

Real life experience:  I am generating about 0.0006 BTC per GH/s, per day, today.  Cut that by 20% every ten days.
So a 25 GH/s machine will generate about 0.015 BTC per day, so maybe 0.15 in ten days (at best, if you had it now).  Maybe 0.366 in the first month.  You might see 1 BTC over the life of a 25 GH/s machine.  I doubt you have a chance to see 2 BTC.
Soooo.. don't pay 2 BTC!  You are exchanging $1249 as an upfront payment for a trickle return payment of maybe 1 BTC over time.  You are lending money to the Bitcoin network, and getting paid back with a shitty (negative) interest rate!

Relax.  We're still waiting for **Bitcoin 1.0**.
Bitcoin is more than just a set of protocol rules.  It's people, merchants, exchanges, investors, companies.  It's a full network.
Any alt-coins that appear that are superior in technology to Bitcoin have a LONG way to go to catch up on those network effects.  And unless it's open source, it can never overtake Bitcoin's popularity among most of the community.  And if it's open source, then any inherent technology advantages can be implemented into Bitcoin.
The bottom line is that Virtual Currency is a winner-take-all game.  There will be a place for alt-currencies.  But nowhere near 3% of the market.

Which one is a a better store of value, the dollar, that has consistently lost value no matter what time period you choose, whether it be a day, a week, a month, a year, or decades, or the Bitcoin, that has fluctuated more wildly on a daily and weekly basis, but over any two-year period has always been worth more?
I think that's the guts of the argument.  You seem to think that slow erosion of value is "stable store".  I don't.  
I'm not exactly thrilled with Bitcoin's volatility at the present time, but it's about what I expected and is on the decline.  But I am definitely not thrilled with the constant, predictable, unending erosion of the value of the dollar.

You can use the "Wallet Details" tab on bitaddress.org, but that's sort of like asking the potential thief if he's honest.  Or the dumb student if he's right.
You can perform the same work on brainwallet.org, but I'm not sure if that can be done offline.  (I think so...)

You are right in trying to verify this, though, since early on, bitaddress generated an occasional bad wallet.  But since, they have run it through some pretty extensive tests.

Oh there are things they can do:
They can treat virtual currency fluctuations as current income, effectively forcing you to cash out or to violate tax law (or come up with tax money from elsewhere).
That's essentially what happened with stock options and AMT.  If you got stock options, you had a huge INCOME tax bill at current market value (not capital gains).  
Later, when they became worthless, you got a series of tiny tax breaks spread over many years (max $3000 per year in excess of any of that year's gains).  In other words, you would never, in your life, get that money back.
This ruined the lives of many of the little people (software engineers, for example) who chased their silicon valley dreams in the dot-com era, working for almost zero wage but huge, over-priced stock options that they couldn't cash out (or chose not to).

There has never, in the history of mankind, been a currency that lacks volatility.  I'm not sure why zero volatility should be a goal of Bitcoin.
Now, if you mean "reduced" volatility, then that seems like a noble goal.  You may even define what an acceptable non-zero value of volatility is.  But "lack[ing] volatility" is not a reasonable goal.
Given that Bitcoin's volatility is on a downward trajectory, it's reasonable to assume that it will ultimately achieve a small enough volatility to be viable.
[This chart]( shows the downward trend.  Maybe in four years, Bitcoin volatility will be near-zero, or small enough to be acceptable.  Give it time.

I was responding to the question of why this has so many downvotes.  If you accept Litecoin, you will turn off some Bitcoin users, because Litecoin helps to devalue Bitcoin.
Some people will say "If I have a choice to support a vendor with Bitcoin, or support a different vendor is diluting Bitcoin, I'll choose the former."  It's a rational thing to do.  Same reason why you'd choose supporting a Bitcoin vendor over a dollar-vendor.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:59:50
There are a few problems with that analogy.  One is that Litecoin offers no significant advantage over Bitcoin, whereas Bitcoin offers huge advantages over the Dollar.
The other is that Bitcoin's growth rate in all of those aspects 2 years ago far exceeds Litecoin's current growth rate in all of those aspects.
The Litecoin ownership pool has jealous dreamers who wish they got into cryptocurrencies earlier, and bot nets.  Some will do very well.

The math behind Bitcoin is that the Private Key is sort of your combination to spend.  And you can literally pick any one you want, as a sequence of 256 bits (like 256 coin flips).  Bitcoin relies on the math that no two people will ever select the same Private key randomly.  They are so long, that it's virtually impossible.
There's a math relationship between public keys and private keys.  Basically, the public key can be derived from the private key, and not vice-versa.  Further more, you can take a message and use your private key with the message and arrive at a "signature" which can be verified with your public key.  This is the special relationship between those two numbers.
So you can sign transactions with your private key, and someone  can look at that signature and your public key, and confirm that you really did have the private key (without you having to divulge your private key).  This is the beauty of digital signatures.  (Contrast this with the 3-digit code on the back of your credit card.  This is supposed to "prove" that you have the card, but how many people have you told that number to, that could then "prove" that they had the card, if they wanted to!)
Then, the bitcoin address can be derived from the public key (and not vice-versa).
So, in summary, all these numbers are mathematically tied together, in one direction:  The private key is the base, from which the public key can be derived, from which the bitcoin address can be derived.
This means that you can make up any private key you want, disconnected from the internet, and then when someone  sends bitcoins to the associated bitcoin address, you own them, by virtue of the fact that you are the only one who knows that Private Key.

It is impossible to ensure that your system is free of this sort of malware and key loggers.  That's why if you are attempting to get "perfect" security, you don't put the system back online.
One solution to this (that many people suggest) is to boot up a Linux operating system to create your keys, and do it all offline, and then when you are done, you can reboot back in Windows (or whatever).  This helps to prevent such an attack.
But for the vast vast majority of people, simply creating it offline and clearing your cache (and I'd even suggest rebooting) should do just fine.

Currently the blockchain contains every transaction.
There are efforts underway to "Prune the tree", so that you don't need to store every transaction.  Really, all you need to prove that a transaction is good is to know that its inputs are good (and that it's signed properly).
The challenge with this is that the transactions are all linked together, and so with the current architecture, you need the whole Blockchain to make sure that A) the inputs haven't been spent since they were first funded, and B) that the original funding is legit.  So you need to go all the way back to Block zero (or certainly to a checkpoint built into the software) to make sure of (B), and you have to come forward to present block to make sure of (A).
There's something called a Merkle Tree, that is a tree of hash values.  Merkle Trees are cool because instead of having to verify the entire Block Chain, you can verify just the parts that you need.  And you can confirm that the parts that you need are legit because the hashes go back to block zero.
So TL;DR is that there is work underway to solve the "large blockchain" issue.  It doesn't shorten the blockchain - there will always be a complete record.  But it eliminates the need for all users to hold the blockchain; they will be super secure just with the parts that they have and the parts that they request.
On question  resyncing gets all the blocks that you missed since the last connection (it catches you up), and it verifies those, and checks them against your bitcoin addresses to see if you have more or less bitcoins than before.

Why do you want to mine?
Mining is essentially spending money now for the hope of getting Bitcoins later.  And so if you are doing that, why not spend money now to get Bitcoins now?  
One might say "I want to spend a little money now and get a lot of bitcoins later" but it doesn't work that way.  Buying mining equipment is essentially buying future overpriced bitcoins.  Much better to buy bitcoins.
Then people say "oh, but I'll make up the difference if Bitcoins go up in value in the future", but that makes even less sense, because in that case, buying bitcoins now will benefit from that as well.
Buy bitcoins, not mining equipment.

This is good advice.  Look at the length of the numbers and the starting digit for a clue.  If you have one that starts with a "5" and is about 50 digits, you are golden - that's probably a private key and can be imported into lots of software (desktop software like multibit or electrum or bitcoin-qt; websites like blockchain.info).  (THAT NUMBER MUST BE PROTECTED - don't post it on here!)
If it's about 34 digits starting with a "1", then check to see how much is in the wallet by going to blockchain.info, substituting the number into the URL like this:    .  That number can be revealed online; it's public.  The only thing you are doing by revealing it to people is associating it to your identity, but you aren't really potentially losing it.
If you have 10 words, that sounds like blockchain.info wallet.   If it's 12 words, it sounds like an electrum wallet / phrase (but that would have required a download).
If it's otherwise a long string, it might be an old instawallet.com wallet, but those are gone.

Agreed.  I was trying to make a joke about how many people sell in a panic and buy back at a higher price.
What happens with news is that the people who hear the news first try to make a rapid assessment as to whether it will cause the price to go up or down.  They do this by looking at the news and watching the market reaction.  Often this rapid assessment is incorrect.  If they were on the verge of selling (or buying) anyway, they may accelerate their decision and pull the trigger quickly.
Then the news spreads, and the people who hear it early and see the early price move think that they can take advantage of the fact that they were paying attention, and so they reinforce the market move, causing an over-reaction.  (These aren't panic sellers, these are opportunist sellers.)
When the news is wide-spread, panic selling (or buying) sets in with a certain crowd, completing the over-reaction.  Panic sellers usually end up selling at exactly the wrong time.  
At last, the over-reaction is seen as an opportunity, and the correction reverses course, as the opportunists execute the reverse transaction from earlier.
**TL;DR:  it's not panic selling that is causing the bulk of the move.  It's "opportunist selling".**

That said, don't bother.  You are wasting time.  Solo mining on that equipment will only waste electricity and will never, ever generate ANY bitcoins, unless you are as lucky as a lottery winner.  Seriously, this isn't going to work.
The idea of a pool is so that you can have a somewhat predictable trickle, instead of a series of zero BTC payoffs with an occasional big pay off.  With that machine, your string of zeros will be extremely long.  Why not start with pool mining, so you can see approximately how long you'd have to wait to get a payoff.   Hint, it's about how long it would take to mine 25.5 bitcoins (give or take a margin of 200%).  And with that equipment, it would be at least a couple of years - all the while it'll be getting more difficult.

Simplest method, use the paper wallet feature of Coinbase.  It's under Account Settings / Integrations / Make Paper Wallet , or something like that.  It's in a weird place in the web app, but you should be able to find it.  Simply create paper wallets, and then send coins to them.
Second simplest method, which someone else mentioned is  .  Again, print the paper wallet and then fund it by sending Bitcoins to the paper wallet Address.

Yeah, I should probably re-word that as a possible scenario, not necessarily a likely one.
Personally, I think the volatility will continue to smooth out as adoption increases (along with price), but that people will have unrealistic expectations of growth, and some will lose out.  It's hard to believe that it will go up forever.
But the ultimate losses might be something like the recent gold market, where it gets over-valued for a few years, and then comes back down.  In other words, at the end, bitcoin may level off to fluctuations, with some sustained periods of downward movement (like Gold has had over the past year).

I don't think inaccuracy and lying in an attempt to be newbie friendly is doing anyone any favors.  
I wouldn't go down the path of "outputs" or "destroying and creating coins".  I think the most newbie friendly path is to draw analogy of signing over checks to another party.  That is essentially how Bitcoin works, and has a old-banking-system analog.
The cool difference from traditional banking is that you can sign checks over to multiple people.  Example:  If I want to pay you 10 Bitcoins, I can sign over a 7 Bitcoin check entirely and a 4 Bitcoin check split among you and back to me.

The difficulty defines the "number that you have to get the hash to be smaller than".  It is set for approximately 2 weeks (2016 blocks, which equates to 2 weeks, if the miners solve six blocks an hour times 24 hours times 14 days).
After 2016 blocks, the difficulty adjusts, typically making it harder to solve blocks.  The adjustment is based on a calculation that tries to force the block-solving time to approximately every ten minutes.  But there's a lag in this adjustment, so right now blocks are getting solved about every seven minutes.
So roughly every two weeks, the target gets smaller.  But it's definitely possible to have a really small hash this week (significantly below the next target).  But yes, the hashes tend to get smaller every couple of weeks.

I am not an accountant, but I think you are looking at this wrong.
Your quote has to do with giving gifts to other people (not registered non-profits).  So if I give a gift to my niece of $25K, SHE has to pay tax on it.  If I give a gift of $13K, she doesn't.
Signguy is worried about taxable income and tax deductions for **himself**.  Accepting the income of $25K, and then donating 23K of it to a registered non-profit makes it COMPLETELY taxfree, for both parties.  Needs documentation, though.
if he accepted the income of $25K and then donated 23K to his niece, he'd have income tax on the $25K, and she'd have income tax on the $23K (probably in excess of the 14K exclusion).  But donating to SeansOutpost shouldn't be a problem if he's a registered non-profit.
Again, I'm not an accountant, but that's my understanding, having done something similar in the past.

How would you work around that?  (I like the idea of a digital signature, but I can't figure out how to make it work!)  Really, a 3rd party needs to be able to confirm that YOU provided the address.

My theory, not listed on that page, is that in an early design, Satoshi had designed it with 32-bit integers, and had 2 decimal places for "cents" much like common money.
21 Million, times 100 "cents" per bitcoin = 2.1 Billion individual units, which fits neatly under the maximum size for a [32-bit number](
All the other math derives from that:  50 every ten minutes, scaling back when you are half-way to 21M, which works out to be 210,000 blocks (which just looks too symmetrical, having that 21 in it).
Once he went to 64-bit integers, he kept the early design and added a bunch of decimal places.

I didn't mean to imply that this PROVES conclusively that the address is owned by the guy on the passport, but merely that it proves that the person with the address CLAIMS that this is his passport.
(Is that what you said was wrong?)
Edit/add:  If you want to really prove that the address belongs to a specific person, there's probably a way to do it, involving a trusted notary who is knowledgeable in technology.  Create one signed message as above, and then have the notary digitally sign that they witnessed the person and verified the passport and the electronic message.  ...something like that.

In case anyone finds this recent price run-up hard to understand:
The whole Liberty Dollar prosecution and the way the US Government has prosecuted anyone who wanted to create any sort of currency competition is exactly why it was wise for Satoshi to stay underground.  
Hell, all you had to do was look at how programmer [Phil Zimmerman]( was treated with his great cryptographic software, to know that a programmer could end up spending a lot of time trying to defend his actions, just for creating something that goes against the mighty government.  It was a no-brainer for Satoshi to go anonymous.  
With the Senate hearings, the tide obviously shifted, from "defend the Dollar" to "We can't let this fledgling industry go to every country but the US!"  This was capped off by Tony Gallippi's fantastic line that the number 1 exchange is in China.  Number 2 is in Japan.  Number's 3, 4, and 5 are in Eastern Europe.  6 is in Canada.  US isn't even on the map, and it's because of their Byzantine state-by-state money rules.
 
Once the tide shifted from "could be outlawed in the US" to "US is going to miss the boat", the value in the US shot up tremendously.
