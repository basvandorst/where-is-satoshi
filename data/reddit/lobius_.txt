So everybody is like you?
Open source software exists for a reason. Because it is really annoying to hear corporate shills claim that certain categories of software(like productivity software) is somehow innovated and worth paying for again.
Music, games, and movies are artwork and you should pay for them. The sticking point is licensing. The agents of the producers of creative works think that they own the work forever and the consumer is just borrowing it.
The dynamics of discussion typically do not involve your thinking.
You are a clown who contributes to making it more difficult to have a rational discussion about digital rights.

The only thing the US government does is the mint.

Federal Reserve NOTES say (emphasis mine): "this NOTE is legal tender for all debts public and private."
We don't have dollars but we can still settle our debts with this note stuff.
Doesn't the euro have a similar message? Or did they just make it with "fuck everybody" in mind? Not even a pretense of the truth?

You are confused.
Part of the problem with Julian Assange is that he is not on British territory. Embassies are considered to be part of the country they represent.
The British are not going to throw away hundreds of years of diplomatic tradition over WikiLeaks. They will simply contain him and make him crazy from cabin fever.
Schwartz was not stealing anything. The documents were wide open and available. Most of them were funded with tax dollars. As to his suicide, he was mentally ill and the prosecutor was overzealous. Everybody knew about his problems with depression including the prosecutor. The prosecutor should be charged with manslaughter.
On Kim… The New Zealand police decided to forget about their own laws in an effort to give the best hand jobs possible to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. His site may have had piraicy but it was not for piracy.
And, yes, the United States government kidnapped him. That's what it's called when you have no legal basis for depriving a person of their liberty and taking them from their home.

Everybody knows it.
Until BTC can be traded after the fourth decimal  point, it is far too unstable for anything but dark side, irrelevant or idiotic activities.

So PayPal recognizes Bitcoin as a form of money.
That has to be a win somewhere.

I couldn't be happier. Now the hacker world can get the thieves and charlatans out of the way while working on actual revolutionary ideas.
You can't kill an idea. This one is out of the bag.
Who is still using friendster? Or MySpace? Facebook is going down as well.
You know what's not going away? Social media. Same with crypto currency.
I figured the bankers were up to something because:
– It was on Bloomberg twice in 10 days
– a company out of Malta dumped $325 million into it
– Al Gore said he liked Bitcoin
I speculated that something big was coming soon.
The only way to defend against these guys is to have a dozen different crypto currencies. If they figure out how to screw the whole dozen, we make three dozen more.
Rinse and repeat.
Now we can fight. I'm looking forward to it.

The world's largest online currency would be the US dollar. The most notable cryptocurrency would be Bitcoin.
Twice in 10 days on Bloomberg. Endorsed by Al Gore. Crapflooded by shady characters from Malta.
Something is up. The only way to defend against these people is to de-centralize into multiple viable cryptocurrencies. There are a lot out there. They just need to be brought up or Bitcoin brought down.

This can't be said enough. Merchants can't do jack with BTC because nobody wants to let go of it. You don't have an economy without merchants.
Http://tradersedgedice.com lots of sales, none in BTC.
This is sad because I would like to create a new model with the BTC symbol on it. Maybe drop the dollar symbol as a snarky protest against the currencies system. Can't do it without knowing there is a market to take it.

Malice or stupidity?
Maybe he did not realize that the USD is not one to one with BTC?
I know that that is a long shot but just wondering… He sees "0.8…", Walks off because he thinks he's being scammed.
Maybe a good due diligence question would be "do you understand the exchange rate?"
If he says "yes", then you say "okay, tell me what you think it is."
Go from there.

Didn't this happen years ago?

Right, so we need a national security mindset for everything?
And the prosecutor's behavior fit the severity of the crime?
No and no. If it was paid with tax dollars and there is no national security issue, that belongs to the people.

Malta is a den of thieves. The fact that these guys are getting involved means they have figured out how to swindle everybody who so much as breathes near Bitcoin.

Another victory for Bitcoin. It is seen as money by the law.
Could you imagine an indictment for trying to extort $1 million in Flooz? 
It would never happen.
