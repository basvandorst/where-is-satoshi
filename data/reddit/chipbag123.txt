It's a nice idea but the lack of trust between strangers kinda limits it
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:01:07
"BREAKING: MtGox CEO has turned up dead in Moscow, apparently his body shows signs of torture..." We can always dream...
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:59:12
Yeah, she does, but for all the reasons I've mentioned already I think I will just try to convince my dad..
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:34:15
No, it's not even her apartment. I think it belong to a relative and she just lives there :(
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:34:05
"Hi, I'm a bitcoin, AMA!"
... I want one of those... I'd go around like "IM A REAL LIFE PHYSICAL BITCOIN"
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:36:02
I'll delete your passport scan for 1BTC ;)
On a serious note, these are Russian hackers who want Karpeles to go to jail. They are our best hope for getting justice against MagicalTux... Westerners have to realize that the Cold War is over and if they can hack MtGox then they can sell stolen credit cards and make more money that way... They don't give a shit about passports, they might be working for some Russians that had a lot of money in Gox... That'd be interesting...
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:09:29
Haha ok. It'd be a pretty amusing april fools prank if the price was changed to $364.00 USD. Bonus points if they don't get their money back! :o
EDIT: It was a joke, that would be mean, you guys don't have to take everything seriously...
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:39:39
I doubt it. Imagine if by 2142 (when the last bitcoin is supposed to be mined, I think) 90% of all BTC has been lost forever haha. I wonder what percentage of bitcoin atm is gone forever?
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:20:38
ELI5 version?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:35:24
I fixed it, thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:27:01
Not if I'm a HS student with no money, then no. :p I've put my $$ into BTC, and I wanna day trade but there is just so much hassle involved in getting a parent to verify ID/etc.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:48:12
Not prison. Russian hitman. Lets find one and pay him in bitcoin, anyone up for it?
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:29:39
Can someone elaborate in layman terms?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:23:24
Also if you can afford a hundred million dollar jet, then someone can probably wait 30mins mins for you.
Can any millionaires confirm?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:19:19
I bet it's Russian hackers if the hacked story is true, it's on Wired now.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:14:34
I like how you think! However, most people don't get that.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:05:42
Well, that's kind of what I mean, something we can't imagine yet. Really, I'm just curious if there are people that truly believe BTC won't be replaced... How and any rational person think that won't happen in their lifetime?
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:48:50
"It helps to talk about it"
Gox: "I don't wanna"
"It's ok, tell me what happened"
Gox: "we lost... All of it.."
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:08:46
3. It should be more than "defacement of property" but courts just aren't really aware of BTC...
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:10:10
Can we get some confirmation regarding if this was due to the Russian hackers? I remember hearing about them, but this guy seems American/English/etc - what happened here?
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:15:20
Someone care to ELI5 this? I read the white paper and stuff but this thread makes 0 sense to me...
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:22:38
Just noticed they use an "l" instead of an I, whatever, both suck.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:12:17
I know, but the guy representing them on IRC that one time (nanashi, I think) had bad english. Plus, I doubt Russians would ask for donations to pay for "pizza and beer" - thats an american thing
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:51:41
Doesn't have to be stereotypical :P
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:46:26
Very cool, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:35:11
Think about it though, a roundtrip flight from DC to HK is a little over $1k. So short term if they give you 2 BTC it's worth it. Long term 1 BTC or less could be worth it. 
In reality, they won't give that much BTC, maybe .0something/.something
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:36:12
Ask any old and trustworthy member of this sub or any legit folks at bitcointalk and they will tell you. It's hard to give a source when the corrupt people in charge delete things :/
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:18:16
You're not mad, you're (probably) over 18 and have a job. I wanna be in that boat but time really takes it's time :(
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:55:44
Ha, must've been an interesting day. Also, you should cut out the "mascot" part and just say you were a bitcoin once :P
And did a lot of people ask what btc is?
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:18:49
Yeah, I go like "hey I could do this with bitcoin", then I realize it's still a long way away. Nobody listens to me. One day I'll be like "I knew bitcoin would become a big thing" and be sad that nobody cared.
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:36:57
ELI5 anyone? 
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:40:59
Yeah, that's my plan too :p
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:25:15
So, how do I work for you? :p
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:40:42
Anyone else notice how it mentioned that an "expert" is being brought in? Finally! A rational, thinking human might do some goo-....
Ah, who am I kidding? It's all gone :/
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:06:39
Also works for charities, the homeless, etc!
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:28:35
Yeah thanks, I forgot to add it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:55:56
I tell them my uncle was the co-creator. 
"We don't see him anymore and he didn't give us any money - he doesn't want us to be corrupt by it"
To be fair, I mess with people all the time. If someone is seriously interested I'll tell them that S. Nakamoto was one of the "main players" but that it's still actively developed and worked on.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:01:02
Can I be friends with your wealthy friends? Not you, but the wealthies.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:14:49
I did click it. It's better now. It's also surprisingly easy to annoy redditors unintentionally....
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:16:25
I saw the thread now, thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-05 14:31:38
What is the bitcoin marketplace? Is there a subreddit for it?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:23:59
Not everything about BTC is upgradeable though, right? I'm not 100% sure about what aspects aren't.
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:56:44
Typo in your post. Mark is on something more serious than caffeine lol
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:48:14
Did you have the acct before it was a BTC exchange, or after it was a bitcoin exchange?
What did the price go down to $0.01 from, and who bought them and how long did it take the market to recover? We're they really sold?
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:17:05
Lol everyone is hacking into MtGox... Russians beat you guys though.
Gold medal: Russia
Silver medal: USA 
Bronze medal: STILL UP FOR GRABS! GO GO GO GO!
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:06:27
I've already found it, but thanks. Link for everyone else!
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:12:39
What's that cliché saying? "Any publicity is good publicity?" Still holds true. Only hurts BTC in the short term.
Also I hope that the 850k BTC was hacked instead of the private keys being lost and gone forever...
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:22:59
But, with the rate that technology is currently growing at, it isn't impossible for tech guys to magically discover something that lets a new coin overtake bitcoin, after all like said everything gets replaced eventually.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:37:32
You see... There's no BTC left that can be returned...
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:34:47
As long as you leave a mechanism to overthrow you when you become corrupt, you have my vote. Seriously, let's make this guy a mod to show how much of a joke StarMaged is... Anyone close friends with an admin?
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:08:57
Yeah I just read that. Thanks for being nice and not calling me an idiot haha. Also gox is down....
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:01:52
Exactly. Anyone, literally anyone could have run MtGox better.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:23:20
Nah, Silicon Valley is working on something to replace them now.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:20:01
A lot of people don't get the problem. There was just a revolution in Ukraine, the president was ousted, Russia has occupied Crimea, Russia might use force. Lot's of people are scared everything might go to shit so a bank run is possible, so they felt a daily limit was a good idea.
BTW, BITCOIN FTW! I am a huge supporter of BTC, and of course it will win in the future, but most westerners don't understand the situation in Ukraine right now.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:52:17
No no no, there is a problem with fiat. The way that it's wired isn't safe, so it's gone.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:32:25
What are better BTC subreddits? I'm all for a proletariate uprising here, but it's kinda hard.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:14:24
He should, I don't think many people have met bitcoins irl :D
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:16:59
"More or less soon"
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:06:13
Me too. I was like... "How... Did everyone assume searching his name in the phone book/Google isn't worth the 2 mins it takes? Nobody...."
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:21:57
Can you elaborate on the Feds seizing 5M commission money from Gox?
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:10:37
Yeah, and we can both hope in the right direction haha
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:02:59
I unsubbed from advice animals, just a bunch of pricks.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:42:42
Ok, ELI0 version now? I'm sure it's a great explanation but it makes me feel like I'm in a math class again and don't understand anything haha.
@_date: 2014-02-05 16:27:42
Aha. I'm subbed there, but I thought he was referring to a mysterious bitcoin subreddit. Thanks for clearing it up.
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:18:37
Yup, all five of them. ;)
Also, OP, wanna stop by there for me? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:44:16
"Did you guys try turning everything on and off?" "brb........."
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:21:13
Ah ok, I thought certain things like 7 transactions per minute/etc couldn't be changed....
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:17:58
someone go establish a good precedent for this...
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:59:44
Can confirm. Am young kid playing with $1,000. Fees aren't that bad :p
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:37:52
Let's start a campaign man, we will get rid of him. It might take days, weeks, months, or even years, but we will do it!
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:00:01
How does a bot decide what a beer costs??????
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:29:20
Hey, Karpeles is the personification of honesty himself, he'd never lie /sarcasm
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:44:41
My exact thought after reading his comment. They can open a child-friendly version that accepts crypto tho.
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:21:03
Thanks for that. I'm going on a cruise and won't have internet so it'll help kill time. 89 pages :p
@_date: 2014-04-21 06:06:29
Theymos promoted Pirate some kind of scam. He is really shady. He's in charge of bitcointalk. He started(?) this sub and has control of it. He does shady things like combine the funds (several thousand BTC?) with his personal funds. He censors things (I think). His goons follow along and are just as corrupt. They are mainly active on bitcointalk, because this subreddit would have a stronger reaction if he pulled the same shit here (see: recent drama over severe mod abuse). Basically, the mods of this sub are evil, and can't be replaced. Lots of appeals have been made regarding Theymos as the guy-in-charge, but nobody cares. It's a whoever-gets-there-first system, and in this case it fucks everyone over, because of reasons. I think this should be fixed for all subs, that if the people in charge have done extremely shady things, there should be a way to replace them, but nobody cares, so I'm really just typing this because I'm bored.
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:59:11
Yeah, she does, but for all the reasons I've mentioned already I think I will just try to convince my dad..
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:27:37
The geniuses at MtGox are not aware of how laws work, so it's ok. Also, Karpeles would never hire a lawyer, he'd try to do it himself lol
I kinda want one, but don't want to make fun of myself for losing a tiny bit on Gox..
@_date: 2014-04-23 02:29:06
My dad isn't a bitcoin user guys, can we give him $20,000 USD too?  
Half of that is a joke, have a nice day!
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:01:57
What is the Russian ban?
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:18:59
It's not like Karpeles uses logic to make decisions, maybe he just got sober for once and decided to use the call center, you know, to make people feel confident.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:27:13
Karpeles found a way, trust me, he told me in a msg on reddit that it's all good and that I should send money to him so he can save MtGox!
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:55:40
See, that makes sense, but she didn't have bills. I'd rather not ask, as it would be kind of awkward and/or sad to find out she is broke or just living off her dad.
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:31:42
MtGox used some "accounting magic".
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:54:30
Hey be nice! :D
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:37:49
I'd put in more, but I'm a HS kid with no more assets to liquidate :p
"Nikon D40? Meh, isn't worth shit anyway..."
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:29:39
She doesn't. I think she's living off credit cards and my grandpa/her dad.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:08:29
Pretty much what I think. Futuristic Hollywood movie feauturing BTC anyone? Haha
