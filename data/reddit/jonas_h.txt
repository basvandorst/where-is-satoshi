Bitcoin is not the definition of complexity. In fact the core of bitcoin is surprisingly simple.

If you really want anyone experienced you really need to provide more information. What is a "handsome amount of money" for example?

If Bitcoin fails I do believe it would be a major setback for cryptocurrencies but I don't believe it's success is dependent on Bitcoin long-term. I think the technology and the promises from cryptos is too good to be forgotten or abandoned. It's quite controversial on this sub but I don't see a problem with altcoins in general at all. If Bitcoin fails one or several will rise to take it's place.
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:58:44
Get educated fool.
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:44:36
Wow, lengthy response. Thanks for writing it out! I find it reasonable.


Sure, but this particular blocksize debate should have been settled long ago. It doesn't feel rushed anymore, simply delayed.




I don't mean that an altcoin will come around which solves the fundamental problem (it may, but I don't have my hopes up) but rather that a failure to scale will put the breaks on Bitcoin adoption and another altcoin will overtake bitcoin's popularity. This is assuming the 1mb limit is not lifted and the fees will continue to dramatically rise, driving away users to other coins. If this happens or not I can only speculate.
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:36:26
Scaling without decentralization isn't interesting.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:50:38
It's quite simple. /btc was created due to the extensive censoring on this subreddit (my comment will probably be deleted). The people running this sub doesn't like that of course. The rest logically follows.
@_date: 2017-02-16 21:06:48
The "fee market" is the de facto reason for the poor user experience, brought to you by the same team behind segwit. The bias in this sub extremely obvious.
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:29:19
There are many instances where a person holds conflicting thoughts simultaneously, it does not mean they dumb or unintelligent. They are simply human.
It means that very rational and logical individuals can hold irrational and illogical thoughts and ideas. It is not an insult to Christians, it is simply stating that christianity promotes illogical and irrational thought ("I have faith" or "I believe in") and that they are human.
The same could be said about other religions and other things as well of course. It is irrational to continue consuming vast amounts of sugar and fast foods and taking sms loans to pay for expensive things yet people do it anyway.

He said *past 24 hours*. See the orange delimiters. 23/20 are during this week. Sick of stupid assumptions.
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:46:19
And in the meantime let's cripple the network and force a bad user experience X years too early. Sounds like a crappy plan.


Artificially limiting it doesn't make any sense. If on-chain storage really is a scarce resource then the open market will naturally create an economic cutoff but with the artificial constraint it is not an open market anymore.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:01:08
When did it become fashion to rely on node count when it's so susceptible to cybil attacks? Maybe when the core supporters realized segwit will never have enough hash power behind it to activate? Makes sense as it's an easier metric to game.
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:21:54




Uh no. But it's cool that you already now can know what bitcoin can and cannot be used for in 11 years, disregarding all future improvements.


So let's trust a bunch of developers to choose it for us? Developers who don't provide data to back it up.


And what about more transactions -&gt; more users -&gt; more absolute income? The "fee market" totally disregards this point.


The storage and bandwidth capacity grows every year and you also have things like pruning. Why should we aim for visa level fees? Bitcoin must be magnitudes better not simply slightly better. "pay to do so" implies that everyone can afford these types of fees while in poorer countries they may not.
@_date: 2016-03-22 05:27:33


You're spouting the spam nonsense again. The simple reason the blocks are larger is the transaction volume has gone up. Get a grip on reality and stop spreading FUD.
@_date: 2017-02-25 13:14:21
The more relevant problems would be funding, legality and security, not basic infrastructure/programming questions such as these. You won't make it.
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:39:34
With zero conf transactions it sure was possible and for small transactions, such as a coffee, the risk was very small.
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:43:50
You mean the temporary anti spam limit?
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:48:26


It's a step in the right direction but the fear of the hard fork is still there.

Which explains why you seemingly don't care about bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:26:34


Cool, so am I.


I never said so either. I am simply flabbergasted by the black/white all or nothing view i.e. 1GB blocks aren't possible therefore all block size increases are unsafe and all attempts should be squashed now. Where is the pragmatism? Satoshi disagreed with the VISA statement btw (not saying he's right).


So where is the "fee market" specification? How does that invalidate the need for the actual responsible devs to provide adequate data?


Of course it helps in the long run, as long as not everyone is blindly following the checkpoints.


What is the long term? 50 years ahead? With the pace Bitcoin is going it'll become irrelevant far before that.
I of course agree with you, Bitcoin isn't the end solution as it has long term problems, but it makes no sense to put the brakes on far too early.


Because a couple of devs decided it's going to be so *now*, not when the market says so.


I hear you. But pushing the "lightning network" as a solution and practically preventing meaningful on-chain scaling before the solution is ready is fucking nuts.

@_date: 2016-01-08 13:55:03
A big feature some coins like Monero implements is private and untraceable transactions. It's in my mind the most exciting feature Bitcoin is missing (apart from scaling/sidechains).
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:48:15


Except all the BU nodes...


A *bit* slower. What do you imagine will happen if a 75% fork happens and it'll take more than a month for the core chain to retarget? Bear in mind that there's already issues with a transaction backlog.
@_date: 2016-01-09 23:55:18
Absolutely. The obvious topic would be the blocksize discussion of course but anything would be appreciated.
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:17:11
I think you missed my point.


That's not the definition of "clear".


Not to the extent recently seen. Also not countering my comment.


Thanks for showing me some hand waving. Even luke agrees:




Emphasis mine.


Again not countering my comment.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:16:01
This sub is amazing with the amount of character assassination and the focus on a single person. It's like it's coordinated? (Obvious I know). We've gone through the same phase with Hearn, Gavin, Jihan and now Roger (I probably missed some). 
How somehow everything wrong in the bitcoin world is the cause of the POI of the month. There's several posts each day (it's possible to count the number of comments) focusing how the POI is a corrupt moron who made a deal with the devil to bring Bitcoin down.
Isn't it beautiful and transparent?

95% of all statistics is made up.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:04:56


This is basically why there has been so much support for Bitcoin Classic, because Core hasn't done this yet.


Hard forks are better as they are not dangerous and decreases complexity. A simple solution is always preferable to a complex one.


The reason a fork to 2MB now is need is because it should have been done ages ago, but Core did not do anything.


Which doesn't exist and won't be ready until who knows when. Why wait and gimp ourselves?


Security isn't so black and white. Why implement RBF when nobody asked for it and it makes 0-conf practically useless? 0-conf as it is now does not offer a lot of security but enough for some merchants to use it, some of the very same merchants are saying they can't if RBF comes to be. So again why implement it now when an alternative like lightning network isn't ready to take over?


Nobody is against LN, just against waiting and doing nothing until it's ready. If it even works. If you want transaction anonymity you should look at Monero for now.
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:40:46


To my understanding FT adds a new transaction format. What transactions would that invalidate?
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:58:35
You also need to consider what's missing. Would any business publicly renounce segwit or support BU show up in the list? How can we be sure that all major businesses are questioned? How can we be sure that we're not favoring certain businesses, for example American ones? What's the difference between a declaration of support vs "activate this instead of BU or anything else"?
This is the same as throwing out the inherent consensus machine in Bitcoin and replacing it with a purely political one. Idiocy.

Thanks for the clarification. The scaling issues only referred to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:28:12
It's not a good approach to simply disregard Mike's words simply because he lost faith in Bitcoin.
There have been a bunch of hard forks in Bitcoins history, why would we loose 20% in case of a hard fork? That doesn't make any sense.
Blocks are full during hours of high load, so we DO need bigger blocks. Practically everyone agrees, even the core devs.
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:47:13


Yeah... Nothing noteworthy scaling wise.
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:56:35
Here's an example of an accidental hard fork:   I was sure there had been more but I may have been wrong.
You seem so sure bitcoin would break on a hard fork which I really don't get. A hard fork is directly using consensus built into bitcoin. With the blocks filling up I don't think we have a working bitcoin ecosystem anymore.

You miss the point, nullc is a big time blockstream/axa employee; he wants Bitcoin to be fragmanted because he hopes he can make money by replacing it with a blockstream developed product which would otherwise be left in the dust by Bitcoin's network effect.
To him it doesn't matter what kind of personal freedom this technology brings the world in the long run: as long as he has funding behind him he doesn't care. It doesn't matter if Bitcoin get turned into a worthless joke, because he'll just pump ~~altcoins~~ lightning network some more.

Then you are blind, they have been actively working against it for some time (see the hong kong agreement for example).

For someone relatively new to bitcoin, if you're not supposed to use blockchain.info as an easy source of info, what's a more reliable alternative?
@_date: 2016-02-20 22:51:06
How can you be a core developer and spout blatantly false shit like this? Miners will by definition decide hardforks.
@_date: 2016-10-12 17:41:39


Mission failed then right?
Segwit should be a hardfork itself, that's one of the main points BU not supporting segwit like it is now. Then all could choose for themselves what to support, as Bitcoin was designed for. 
I don't really care about Core having wasted development hours. Had they gone for the proper solution from the start we wouldn't be in this mess from the beginning. Instead softfork has been touted as the solution and 95% is for some reason required to avoid "contentious" forks, whatever that means. That's simply a social construct attached on top of the blockchain.

So you admit it isn't working properly today.


Oh I've seen a ton of evolutionary leaps. Bitcoin was and is revolutionary. The "fee market", making slow scaling progress and placing all bets on a technology (LN) which is far from ready is not evolutionary.
@_date: 2016-10-03 19:05:35


The irony.
@_date: 2016-10-29 17:43:51
That's strong language, but you misunderstand. You appeal to the core developers authority that they know best. I never said experience isn't valuable nor do you have any idea how much or how little I personally have.
But based on your idiot reply... It's obvious who doesn't have enough experience.
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:47:48
Just because you've never had a transaction stuck doesn't mean other didn't. With limited space then everyone won't get on the buss if everyone pays the "appropriate" fee if the seats aren't enough.

You do realize that there are different amounts of transaction fees, right? I am saying we are paying too much.
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:42:29
I was simply commenting on the thread topic.
And if I were commenting on the devs I wouldn't say they haven't been working, I would say they have worked on the wrong thing.
@_date: 2016-10-29 11:38:09
1. Fees rising is not good for bitcoin, it hinders adoption which is bad for bitcoin.
2. If everyone use fee estimating software there will still be people waiting, as they just don't fit.
3. That the fee market is good for bitcoin right now... I just don't see it. *Maybe* in the far future but right now there's no reason to artificially create one, which has been done right now.
4. You cannot draw the conclusion that it's the reason for the jump in price. There may be several different reasons, the best we can do is guess. That the recent backlog would be a source for the positive jump in price is a bad guess.
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:09:06
It's almost like they don't have an immediate effect. There is no way the recent mass of unconfirmed transactions can be seen as positive, regardless of your support.
As has been proven again and again, the cryptocurrency market isn't rational. The lesson is to not draw too many conclusions from it.
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:26:08


I don't even know how to respond... That's literary not how bitcoin works... Sigh.
@_date: 2016-10-29 17:25:05
I know it is nice to be able to [appeal to authority]( but it's better to discuss the arguments themselves. But sure, you go ahead and try to attack me instead of my arguments if that's the best you can do.
This is only my opinion of course (that the devs have focused on the wrong thing), and I may be wrong, but I was merely explaining my top level comment to you.
@_date: 2016-10-29 09:04:12
Wrong solution, bad understanding.
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:38:10


That's very much not great. That's barely functional.
@_date: 2016-10-29 01:06:57
That's why the problem is with bitcoin itself, not the wallets.
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:43:21
I completely agree, I was merely following the logical thought from the parent comment.
@_date: 2016-10-12 17:33:19
Bitcoin is the better form of governance and it has nothing to do with having an unanimous decision. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:44:36


I'm arguing we shouldn't be there. It's an artificial state of affairs way too early in Bitcoins life.
@_date: 2016-10-29 03:25:17
Obviously it failed then, because the spam is pushing out legitimate transactions.
This also assumes that it's only spam pushing out transactions. Bitcoin is getting popular and legitimate transactions may push out other legitimate transactions. Now you're competing against others who want to transact on the blockchain, which defeats the "anti-spam" measure.
How would you even define "spam"? Unintended but supported usage shouldn't be labeled spam.


Again a design misunderstanding. When a designed object/system doesn't work as expected it is the fault of the designer and not of the user. It's simply a badly designed system which gives a bad user experience.
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:36:59
Assuming it was an attack the way it's weathered is far from optimal. What happened to many legitimate users is that their transactions were left unconfirmed which is a fault in the bitcoin ecosystem. This is not good.
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:56:43
I referred to "system" as the whole bitcoin experience, but somehow you want to split it up into bitcoin and wallets?
If we're getting technical then if TCP/IP wasn't working properly and didn't provide the proper capabilities then it would be the fault of the protocol. This is the case with bitcoin now.
Casting superficial blame isn't productive. "Wallets should raise the fees" is not the proper solution.
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:06:55


It's like you don't understand bitcoin... If it's possible for a minority to disrupt your plan like this then you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2016-10-29 08:48:17
Way to take things out of context. Read and understand the context of the sentence.
@_date: 2016-10-17 17:25:34
Explained here:
@_date: 2016-10-29 03:15:54
The fees are skyrocketing which is quickly pricing out smaller transactions so Bitcoin is barely functional as a payment processing network, which is what I was referring to. Instead it is changing to something else entirely.
A non-compromising view like this isn't beautiful, it's shortsighted and non-realistic.
@_date: 2016-07-21 15:07:48
As long as the pros can be discussed as well which isn't the case here hence my complaint.
