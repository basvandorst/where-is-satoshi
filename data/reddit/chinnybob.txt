Bitcoin transactions *cannot be canceled*. As soon as you broadcast a transaction you are committed to waiting for it to confirm or double spending it with a higher fee.
As the bitcoin wiki says:

This is wrong. The witness is not stored in a separate section of the block. It is inline with the rest of the transaction. Segwit nodes dynamically strip the witness signatures when sending the block to a non-Segwit node.

No, this is how Microsoft *always* accepted Bitcoin. You could never use it to buy things directly from them, only top up your Microsoft wallet. Now you can no longer even do that.

Yes, that is exactly how it works. However, in the case of Valve, they would use ~~Coinbase~~ Bitpay. And lots of other sellers use payment providers.

One possible reason is because of Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) transactions. Where you can make a low-fee transaction confirm by spending one of its outputs with double the required fee - meaning the child transaction has enough fee to cover both.

My 2 cents. I used to run a full node but then I stopped, and then recently I started again. Why? Well the bandwidth use of the node got to high. This is related to the block size yes, but only indirectly. The big bandwidth drain was new users starting up bitcoin core (a full node) and grabbing the whole chain, but then not leaving it running. This doesn't actually help the network. Now that more people are using spv the load on my node is actually reduced, so I'm running it again. The disk usage is not an issue at all. And one other thing: I have always and only run a local full node. What changed is whether or not I ran a public one.

Those other people aren't hiring someone, they're conducting a witch-hunt against someone who's opinion they disagree with.

Ok I'm pretty sure what they mean is that the invoice will become invalid if it has zero confirmations at any time after it is one hour old, and before it reaches six confirmations.
Once a transaction has at least one confirmation it can only either get another confirmation from the next block, or go back to zero because of a reorg (or possibly back to one). So if you see a tx with greater than 0 but less than 6 confirmations and it is over 1 hour old, then you know it will either fully confirm or become invalid within at most 5 blocks.
The documentation isn't explicit on this but I believe this is the only sane interpretation.
Either way I think the documentation does need to be clarified here to make it explicit.

The two addresses alledgedly performing this attack have "mined" 3000 BTC over the past three months. That means they have almost 1% of the network hashing power.

If you clone a malicious repository on Windows or OS X, the malicious repository owner can execute arbitrary code with your user's permissions.

And as for grinch, it's basically saying "if you allow users to install software then they will be able to install software." No shit.
Shellshock was also over-hyped, as was the USB one which was basically "if you plug in a keyboard you can type any command you want therefore USB is insecure".

Mining involves partially cracking a hash. The resulting value only has to be sufficiently close to the required value. The closeness is defined by the current mining difficulty. Cracking a single hash is would be equivalent to a difficulty of over 2^224, which is around 600 billion billion billion billion billion billion times harder than mining a block at the current difficulty.

As for your friend, well, I see that argument all the time about how some piece of software was great 20 years ago but is not suitable in the modern world. It usually means "I don't understand how this software works, and I'm not old enough to remember how crap it *used* to be compared to what it is like today."
edit: They're not necessarily wrong that the software sucks. But the mistake that proponents of this argument often make is to assume the software sucks because the requirements changed, and therefore rewriting it will be easy. The truth is often that the software sucks because it is an inherently difficult problem which requires compromises, and the reason the software is still around 20 years later is because it sucks less than any other way of doing it.

Has anyone added up the value of all the repeat payments in the blockchain where the final transaction has a different type of padding on the script?
Also, if their wallet really lost track of which coins were spent, wouldn't it become improbable that any given withdrawal would succeed long before they actually totally ran out of coins? Surely after 50% were "stolen" they would be generating more invalid than valid tx.

Immediately. That's one reason why you sometimes see "empty" blocks. The pool can always send new work (same block height, different tx) to miners though. The point is that finding the correct nonce is supposed to be difficult enough that it takes 10 minutes to find if everyone starts looking immediately. But since it is a random search, sometimes it takes a longer or shorter time. In the long run it balances out, but "easy" blocks can come up empty.

No large network has a direct *physical* connection between every pair of nodes, because that is prohibitively expensive.
Circuit switching was invented to allow a network to behave as if it had a direct physical connection between every pair of nodes, even though it actually didn't. But this system has a drawback: you cannot establish connections between every pair of nodes simultaneously, because the real physical connections cannot be shared.
Packet switching was invented to remove this restriction. In a packet switched network every pair of nodes can communicate as if they were directly connected to each other, and they can all do it at the same time. You just get a slower connection instead of not being able to connect at all.
TCP/IP is specification for a large packet switched network.
So yes, there are no direct *physical* connections. But the whole thing is designed to work as if there were, hence the term *virtual* circuits.
This is just as important part of the design as robustness.

To elaborate, it doesn't take much thought to make an altcoin. To make one that actually works is a bit harder. Many of the failcoins out there have serious problems like connecting to each other's networks because they use the same version identifier as the coin they copy pasted from. This leads to transaction propagation issues because half the nodes you are connected to think your transactions are invalid. There are even a few supposedly different altcoins that share the same blockchain because the "developers" changed literally nothing except the name and logo. There are some which are identical except for the address format, which allows people to import keys from another altcoin and magically get coins. The whole thing is a colossal mess.

Your figures represent a constant datastream at 24kbyte/s for all of December. Average packet size 180 bytes, average rate of 168 packets per second.
BTC-E has a minimum trade amount of 0.01 BTC and a 30 day volume of around 1,000,000 BTC, which means at the very most 100,000,000 trades occurred. Your stats show over 440,000,000 packets, each one large enough to hold at least one transaction. Assuming half of them are ACKs, that's still an unrealistically large amount of data.

None of them would accept the transactions. All of them would accept the blocks containing those transactions, because those blocks tell old clients not to verify the transactions. That is literally the definition of a soft fork. If you think that this is actually a hard fork, then you must think that the proposal for adding segwit is also a hard fork, since it works *exactly the same way*.
In short, a soft fork does not mean that old clients will continue to work correctly. It just prevents them from creating a parallel block chain.

The vast majority of altcoins are just clones made by kids with no idea what they are doing, and probably no intention of scamming. They are destined to fail when lack of technical ability in the one-person dev team leads to stagnation and abandonment.
Nearly all the rest are scams, with the most obvious example being Solidcoin1.0/2.0/3.0/Microcash. This series of coins followed the exact same trajectory that Paycoin is now on, including the license violations, forum censorship, obvious sock-puppetry, promises of a price-floor, and centralized mining only for trusted insiders.
As well as the obvious signs like huge premines and centralized mining, there are a bunch of slightly more subtle warning signs that make it easy to spot shitcoins that are going nowhere:
1. Single anonymous developer who refuses to collaborate with others.
2. Developers who make claims about their technical ability which don't match reality, or make false claims about other coins. For example, claiming to have fixed bugs in the source they forked but being unable to name any such bugs or the fixes, and handing out forum bans to anyone who asks about this.
3. Wallets only available for one platform, because the dev only knows how to use one platform. Often they'll make changes that break the build on other platforms without realizing it.
4. Inept search-and-replace on the original code. Again often breaking things or violating the license.
5. Failure to even make enough changes that their coin is sufficiently different from the one they forked, leading to cross-contamination between clients and blockchains which harms both coins.
6. No source code revision history, just point release tarballs or no source at all. Usually done in order to hide the fact they've made little to no changes beyond the inept search-and-replace.
7. Claims such as "P2P distributed exchange" or "guaranteed price floor" or other features which are mathematically and/or economically impossible.
8. Claims that built-in taxation and/or premine (which goes directly to the developer) will be used to promote the coin, stabilize the price, or protect users - even though any such "coin protection fund" would instantly crash the market if liquidated for use.
There are at most four altcoins which are (probably) not scams and have enough community activity to survive. I'm not going to just tell you what they are though. Everyone will just think I'm shilling anyway. If you do a bit of research and consider the warning signs it's not hard to figure out which four I am talking about.

Well, for example, a few weeks ago I sent a transaction with 390 satoshi per byte fee, which at the time I sent it was supposed to confirm within 0-1 blocks. Immediately after I sent the transaction, the estimate for 0-1 block confirmation rose to 400s/b, and the estimate for 390s/b changed to 1-5 blocks. After 24 hours my transaction had zero confirmations, and I had to -zapwallettxes and resend it. At this point the estimate for 0-1 block confirmation was 460s/b, which is what I used, and the transaction confirmed in the first block.
The same thing has happened to me multiple times, so now I just look at the recommend fee to confirm in the next block and add 20 s/b to it to be safe.
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:15:32
If the transaction is within the rules of the blockchain then it is NOT safe to assume it will never be confirmed and you should double spend either back to yourself or to the original recipient as soon as possible. If you don't do this then a miner could confirm it at any time in the future.
It isn't possible for the same coins to be spent twice so if you send another transaction using the same input coins and that transaction gets confirmed then the original one will become invalid, and in fact this is the ONLY way to ensure that the original is never confirmed.
The one thing you should not do is assume the transaction will never confirm and then attempt to repeat the transaction using different inputs. This is the only way you can end up paying twice. People have made this mistake in real life:

Yeah, this is a completely shit way to split your coins.
A much better way is to simply buy coins mined after the fork and then mix them into your transactions. This guarantees the tx will be invalid on the other chain.

It does oscillate. This is why merged mining was invented.

The biggest use (at least short-term) for LN will be the situation where:
1. Person buys bitcoin on an exchange.
2. Person sends that bitcoin to a payment service like coinbase.
3. Coinbase immediately sends the bitcoin back to the exchange and sells it.
With the current systems that's two tx every time someone buys something at coinbase. With LN, coinbase can just settle once per month with the exchange. Regardless of how many payments they process the bitcoin ends up exactly where it started, so the channel will never drain.

It is probably because I am trying to double spend a stuck tx from yesterday. I let bitcoin core choose the fee automatically which is usually fine.

What happens is that as soon as you send out the transaction the wallet hides the coins to prevent you from accidentally double spending. They don't actually leave your control until that transaction is confirmed. You want to do a double spend here, so you have to work around this safeguard.
You have a few options: 
1. You can wait for the transaction to pass a certain age without confirming and then the wallet should show them again. I'm not sure exactly how long this takes, but it's on the order of a few days I think. Also it might depend on the wallet. *Note that the original transaction could still be confirmed after this happens.*
2. You can tell the wallet to forget about unconfirmed transactions. This is the same as the above but without having to wait.
3. You can manually write a transaction and then have your wallet sign it. This is quite dangerous if you don't know what you are doing.
I can't give you an exact step by step guide because I have never had to actually do this myself. Also it is highly dependent on the wallet you are using.

I am unhappy that nobody was able to correctly tell me the actual cost.

There is always an "in-between time" for bitcoin. Even with zero-confirmation transactions there is still a network propagation delay. This is the very reason why bitcoin operates the way it does, in order to derive consensus despite these delays. If it were possible to simultaneously and provably broadcast information to every node instantly without centralization then the blockchain would not be required.
But this doesn't have much to do with the velocity of money, which is just about how often a specific unit of currency is spent in a fixed time frame, e.g. how often a specific dollar bill is spent in a year.

I would not take his word for it. He posts incorrect stuff all the time. (And often it gets reposted here - [example](
It is my understanding that nodes are only announced on the network once they have opened a channel. After that you cannot tell whether they are online or not unless you try to connect to them (which may not be possible even if the node is online, depending on the node configuration.) Nodes which have no connections on the graph are nodes which have previously opened channels, but those channels are now closed. And you can't see channel activity at all because it is private between the two participants of the channel until the channel is closed.

52560 * 4 = 210240, but the reward halves every 210000 blocks. Therefore you are adding 60 extra block rewards per "year".

Miners (pools) are free to use any nonces they want. Since each pool is constructing a different block it does not matter if they are testing the same nonces because different block will need a different nonce anyway. This is also why you can't claim the block yourself if you are mining on a pool.
The very early bitcoin miners started out at 0 and incremented by 1 each time and in those early blocks you can see a direct correlation between the time between blocks and the nonce values. But that doesn't hold anymore now that there are loads of different implementations.

Yes. If you assume 100 bytes to spend a UTXO (which is probably on the low side) and a fee of 100 satoshi per byte (also low), then currently about 650 BTC, or about $1 million, are "economically unspendable". Since those outputs are by definition very small they account for a disproportionate number of UTXOs; nearly one third of the whole UTXO set is currently unspendable. (about 14 million out of 46 million.)

This is really misleading. The estimates on 21.co are very very inaccurate, and if you send with 20 satoshi per byte when the chart looks like the screen shot it will simply never confirm. The way I read it is: if the bar is orange it will never confirm. If it is brown it has about a 50% chance to confirm within 3 days. The first green bar will confirm within about an hour. If you want to confirm in the very next block you have to go with the fee of the second green bar. So the very minimum you should use based on that chart is 141 satoshi per byte.

tl;dr 100% premine, can only be bought from the creator, fixed exchange rate of 0.01 BTC/MasterCoin good for one month only, no refunds. Cool scamcoin bro.

Same problem here. Automatic refund of mispayments only seems to work until the transaction is successful, so if you send duplicates they don't get refunded.

Then you're running an NPO and are probably tax exempt anyway.

Look at it this way: if you buy a sandwich for $5 and then eat the sandwich, do you lose $5? In a way you do, but it isn't the whole story.
If you buy bitcoins for $5, then buy something with them, and then the merchant sells them for $4, then everyone profited - you got whatever you bought, the merchant got $4, and the traders got $1. The traders provided liquidity, and in return they took some of the profit.

This is the correct answer. OP's post is bullshit. I bet the customer support agent doesn't even know the difference between bitcoin and bittorrent. They just hear "bit"-something and start reading their canned reply. Guys, this is what you get for using a shit ISP. Switch to a better one.

bitbet is the only betting site where you can lose money on a winning bet. avoid this scam site.

Would it be reasonable to say a sidechain is like a merge-mined altcoin, except with no block reward, and the only way to get coins on it is by a direct swap from the main chain? (If not, how does it differ?)

If you run software downloaded from the internet, even if it is in source code form, then you can be hit with this attack unless you audit that source code.

Anyone got some more information about this? Seems like I am only getting one side of the story here.
@_date: 2013-08-04 10:24:51
The most likely explanations:
1. You're wrong, and other vendors are mass shipping right now. 
2. Someone is mining for themselves with customer's hardware.

All transactions are buying BTC and selling BTC. That's literally the definition of a transaction.

No, Sky is not a "real" ISP. They are a pay TV company first, a phone company second, and an ISP third. They are one of the "big six" UK ISPs, none of which are primarily ISPs, and all of which have clueless support staff.

Those threads remind me of solidcoin threads from 18 months ago. The exact same kind of trolling is used: make a bunch of wild claims and offer no evidence. If anyone asks for evidence, accuse them of being a sock puppet using a sock puppet account.

No. Not every one is such a dipshit that they need protecting from themselves and I do not appreciate being forced to open up another avenue of attack to anyone who decides to steal my phone.

You cannot claim the reward for the block because you have solved a block which pays out to the pool, but you can withhold the solution from the pool and prevent the pool from claiming the reward while still being paid for the other shares you submitted. This attack has been used against pay per share pools in the past and is the reason they are no longer common.
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:12:17
No, LOGICALLY what happened is that the ISP never blocked Slush's pool at all, and the customer support agent thought OP was talking about bittorrent, so read out the script for when people call up about being unable to access pirate bay.
