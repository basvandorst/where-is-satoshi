I save my mnemonic to a .txt file on my desktop. I use NordVPN 24/7, I have well over 1 months rent in my wallet. My private key and password are on a USB not connected to the CPU, and I use 2 factor authentication with my cell phone. 
I have a very trimmed down version of Windows, safer than most. I’ve gotten a virus, but it mostly was a nuisance that was clear within 24 hours. 
Is the 12 word key really that all powerful for someone to get ahold of? It seems there’s a few more hurdles that they would need to access my wallet than the words list.

Thank you, good information. I wouldn’t expect someone to gain access to my mnemonic, but for someone who keeps $500+ in there, that is valuable information. Thank you.

I have used LibertyX, and I like it. I usually call the establishment to make sure they accept it, because not all that say they do, actually do.

I’ve successfully used the coinstar BTC machine to get bitcoin quickly. Fastest way to turn cash to wallet that I know. Fees end up being 8-10%, but that’s low compared to what I’m used to. 
Before you go, get yourself registered and any red tape finished. If you don’t pass it, don’t use this. It took me less than 10 mins. Had to give normal btc purchasing info, nothing more. 
So I’ve deposited between $80 and $2000 on separate occasions. Each time, I could send it to my ultra encrypted wallet in 30 mins. Very happy with it. My previous go-to was bitquick. Most banks around me have stopped accepting cash transfer unless you had an account, and people take advantage of the markup there. They’ve gotten me my money within 3 hrs of deposit. Besides driving to the bank, driving to the other bank co-op, waiting in line, uploading picture receipt, it’s not quite as easy. 
I did have a snag on my last CoinME transaction. I hadn’t used the service in almost 10 months. I saw that the transaction was redeemed, but not in the wallet. After 6 hours, I contacted customer service. They said that transactions were having problems, check back over 24-48 hours and I was upset, but after about 24 hours, it was there. 
Overall, I would say, compared to other quick cash to coin methods, this is by far my favorite and least costly.

With the volatility of btc, I’d rather not wait 4 days in most cases, unless it’s going towards a savings/storage type wallet. I was speaking more towards a need btc quick situation.

I just posted about coinstar/atm purchasing. If you’re willing to pay 10%, you can get $2500 day. I like to get $2000, buy what I need, and let the rest sit for a while, and when I come back, I’m pleasantly surprised.

I made a new, more secure wallet a long time ago. But we are talking about a blockchain online wallet with the login profile in the footer of every email. Password and 2FA protected. They would need more than the 12 words to get in right? Besides finding the 12 words and logging in, they would have to have email access also, any password change from an unknown IP requires email authentication, then 7 digit text confirm. 
I’ll try and keep my private info offline, and I’ll just google this question, but what are some of the more “safe” wallets that are recommended?

They charge 4%. Their exchange rate is usually higher, but tell me a place that you can get $2500 per day with a smaller fee. My bitquick fees were getting close to 15%, but it was my best choice. Plus, if you buy and the market jumps 3% (happened to me more than once) you get the same amount you put in. Not seeing the problem.
