I agree with you, but did Satoshi define blockchain somewhere? The word isn't even mentioned in the whitepaper. 

The "chain of blocks" it describes is such a mundane implementation detail that it doesn't even get a name. It was really just one part of an invention called "Bitcoin" that is fairly useless on its own.

I don't understand at all why a private blockchain is even a concept. Are banks foaming at the mouth over private Hashmaps? Private arrays? There's really nothing to a private blockchain beyond databases and PowerPoint slides.

How could banks use a private blockchain to send money to each other? Does the fiat money exist on the blockchain? Is the plan to create a new currency like bitcoin that all banks would use? Or would the blockchain just be passing some sort of messages or instructions?
@_date: 2016-08-14 06:52:02
Interesting idea. How does it work though? How can you sell excess power to someone else without selling it to a retailer?
@_date: 2016-08-25 07:41:04
So it's just a message passing mechanism. Why the heck would you need a "blockchain" to do that? And why would banks ever agree to a system where every other participant in the network can see their messages? 

It doesn't make any sense at any level. 

Here is an idea. How about the banks make a secure, closed system to pass messages, with the message format define by a society of representatives from each bank. In this system the messages are payment instructions, and no individual member can see any of the other member's messages, and there is no need for members to store messages that don't relate to them. We can give it a catchy name like the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.

Yep just as I predicted. They're gonna start de-emphasising the word "Blockchain" now that it has run its course as a marketing buzzword. They're like "oh yeah it's not the technology that's important, it's the ' business problem'... The solution just falls out trivially when you define the problem". "oh and by the way, you don't need a blockchain, you need corda, which is something that doesn't exist yet... But it's gonna be AWESOME!"

What actually happens is that you both sign an updated bitcoin transaction which adjusts the balances into the merchants favour by the amount of the payment. But you do NOT broadcast it to the blockchain, you both just hang on to it.
That's pretty much it. If there is a dispute, then the most recent transaction broadcasted to the blockchain settles things, but if there is no dispute, then for the purposes of this channel, just having the transaction is as good as having the confirmed bitcoin on the blockchain, and you can spend it back through the same payment channel in the same manner.

If you read it you'll see the whole interview was about how to classify and tax the gains from his mined Bitcoins...

AFAICT the only 2 instances where GST would be charged on the entire value of a bitcoin is:
 
1. when a GST-registered business buys bitcoin directly with AUD from somewhere like CoinJar, or 
2. a business uses a bitpay style payment processor to sell goods or services to other GST-registered businesses.

The [example they gave]( seems to indicate that there would be no GST charged for individuals:
Liam carries on a business buying and selling bitcoin (BTC) as an exchange service online in Australia charging a 1% commission on the published exchange rate. Liam is registered for GST.
David, who is not registered for GST, uses Liam's online service to exchange 10 BTC to Australian dollars. The exchange rate at the time of the transaction is 1BTC = AUD662. The commission is $66.20. David receives AUD$6,553.80 for his 10 BTC.

Obviously bitcoin didn't exist when they wrote this, but it seems to me that this definition was designed to include anything that is reasonably used as "money". 
Supporting this idea is the fact that they contrasted this with these examples of things that are obviously not used as "money": 










Their attempts to explain why bitcoin is not covered by (e)(ii) and (e)(iii) seem very laboured, and smacks of someone justifying a decision they have already made.

Fractional reserve is the wrong word. But the money that banks create is accepted as genuine by other banks. However any BTC that a bitcoin bank tried to create will not be accepted by other services. That is the key difference.
@_date: 2014-07-28 05:10:58
The difference is bitcoin. You can pay any of your regular bills directly with bitcoin, no AUD involved. It is great for people who want to do more transactions with bitcoin.
Some advice though, if you're not into bitcoin... cancel your direct debit agreements ASAP. Nothing good can come from giving random companies unfettered withdrawal access from your bank accounts.

I understand how you feel, having had several Australian bank accounts closed unfairly. Try not to take it personally though, they're not trying to scam you or target you personally.
I worked at BankWest for a while, and can tell you from personal experience that they are EXTREMELY risk averse. And for good reason! They (and CBA who owns them) made some terrible decisions in recent history about commercial loans, destroyed many people's businesses and were the subject of class actions and senate inquiries. So now they will likely be very quick to avoid any kind of risk at all.

You should read the rest of the tweets.

So, would I be correct in saying that if the value selected is ~~'invalid'~~ (a block that exists only on a chain with less work), the only thing that will happen is that the node will be forced to validate the entire longest chain? i.e. It will still reach the same consensus about the correct chain as another node, it will just take longer.
EDIT: I think I'm confused about the meaning of "invalid" in this conversation
@_date: 2016-01-05 00:50:01
It might be possible to pursue that. I have no doubt that they'll have some clause about exceptions in the case of fraud though - I can't see you ever getting them to pay for any bounced payments.

The Bitcoin Cash network launches in about 6 hours time. 
But I again stress, this is an altcoin and has literally nothing to do with the current Bitcoin network, and will not directly impact it in any way. The only way it could affect Bitcoin indirectly is if a bunch of miners decide to stop mining Bitcoin and mine BitcoinCash instead, which would reduce Bitcoin's hash rate.

This is a common misconception. The "longest chain" rule is actually the "longest valid chain" rule.

You don't have to do anything - your existing coins are already valid on all future forks. 
If there are 5 forks, you will have coins valid on 5 chains, i.e. 5 times the amount of coins. If there are 100 forks, you will have coins valid on 100 chains, etc. Whether they have any actual value in real life is another matter.

Hi 1bitcoineater!
We're huge Bitcoin fans, and have been running Living Room of Satoshi for Australians for just on three years now, wanting to provide a useful service for Australian Bitcoiners.
I guess like any service, it is safest to assume that we are collecting and storing any information you give us. There is a link to our privacy policy on this page:  
However, we're very conscious of collecting only the information we need, and we've designed our service to be used with an absolute bare minimum of information (as you've probably observed). It's safer for the security of your information, and it just makes sense.
The government doesn't currently require us to submit any information to them, but of course we are going to comply with reasonable law enforcement requests, so it's not a good place to avoid paying taxes. Anonymous is probably not a good word, so I'm sorry if we've given you that impression. You couldn't really even describe Bitcoin as anonymous! :)
We'd love to have you as a customer, and hope we can make paying bills a bit more pleasurable.

No. No it is not. Not even close. 
The money banks lend out is created on the spot out of thin air. They do not wait for deposits before making loans.
That's where all new fiat money literally comes from. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:01:53
I didn't say banks could create unlimited money. I said that money is created out of thin air when banks make loans. 
"Fractional reserve banking" is a misleading phrase, and certainly doesn't describe the way modern banking systems create loans and new money. 
You could not create "new bitcoin" in the same way. Bitcoin is created at a predictable rate in each block. Fiat is created when loans are made. There is no way to create new bitcoin other than mining a valid block.
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:50:16
I get it
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:09:37
Reserve requirements are only against the banks liabilities, i.e. Customer deposits. It has little to nothing to do with their assets (loans), and absolutely does NOT imply that banks use customer deposits to fund their loans. Such an idea is absurd even if you just think about it for a while! 
Please read the paper. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:07:47
I know it seems hard to believe if you are not familiar with it, but that's how it works. Most banking systems do not have reserve requirements any more, they were phased out long ago in favour of capital requirements.
Deposits are absolutely not being lent out, money is newly created every time a loan is made. Here's some further reading : 
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:57:22
Dude that's not even how it works in the US banking system.  What you are describing is an extremely common misconception, I fully understand why you would think that. But it's just a childish fantasy, that has no basis in reality.

If banks could only lend out what they had on deposit, then there would be no money, because money is literally created when loans are made. That's where money comes from.

I don't think the first method guarantees the death of the minority chain.

Two Chains method:
If you design the new fork so that miners can merge mine with the old fork (so they can ostensibly 51% attack it) what's to stop them mining valid blocks on both chains instead? In fact it would probably be in their economic interest to do so!
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:40:51


by making new loans. When a bank makes a loan, for example
to someone taking out a mortgage to buy a house, it does not
typically do so by giving them thousands of pounds worth of
banknotes. Instead, it credits their bank account with a bank
deposit of the size of the mortgage. At that moment, new
money is created.
The whole thing is worth reading when you get time. All modern fiat banking systems work this way.

Lending has everything to do with money creation. It literally is how money is created. Where do you think new money comes from?

Reserve requirements are not an important aspect of monetary policy frameworks in most advanced economies today. They are not even reserves in the way that you think (the way that 'fractional reserve' proponents believe), and have little to do with loan making:


Most do not even have reserve requirements, and are regulated through capital requirement rules. Even though the US still does have these vestigial requirements, they are generally not the limiting factor for money creation even in the US.

It is created (out of thin air) when the loan is made, and deposited to the customer's account (and later transferred to the seller of the house). This is now a liability for the bank.
At the same time, a corresponding asset is created for the bank (the mortgage). So from the bank's perspective, it is in the same position as before, but new money has been injected into the economy.
This also means that when the mortgage is repaid, money is destroyed.
So money really only exists when there is debt. All the money you have represents a debt somebody owes.
Pretty convoluted system hey! Bitcoin is much simpler to understand.

Yes, it will be a bit of a kick in the teeth to Australian Fintech startups if the government is able to circumvent these tax laws when it is convenient for them. The GST makes selling bitcoin prohibitively expensive for regular Australian companies.

I used to work at Virgin Australia airlines as a programmer, and DCC was one of the proposed new "features" they were going to add. I refused to have anything to do with it. It is pretty obvious that it is just a way to rip off customers by deceit.
If they want to be immoral, they can do it without me.

You can pay bitcoin directly onto an existing credit card at [Living Room of Satoshi]( Australia's bitcoin bill payment service.

Once you have some bitcoin, try Living Room of Satoshi on the Australian side. No account setup needed... Literally nothing. Fast and easy into any Australian bank account.

[comparebitcoins.net]( gives you an accurate idea of all the options available in Australia for buying and selling bitcoin.
For example, even though there is no GST, you are still going to be paying a pretty substantial premium to buy with places like CoinLoft. But there are some exchanges and markets that offer surprisingly good value, have a look for yourself.

Banks don't loan out your money. That would be a hilariously inefficient way to run things.

Banks don't practice Fractional Reserve banking.
They do not need to wait for someone to make a deposit before they can make a loan. And your house mortgage money certainly isn't made up out the savings accounts of 200 pensioners. Banks have something far better - they can create deposits... out of thin air.
Banks create deposits when somebody requests a loan. They accept other deposits from ordinary people as a cheap way to manage liquidity, but don't be fooled, the liquidity management has nothing to do with the ability to make new loans. The only real limit that means anything to banks is the capital ratio requirement.
People say bitcoin is complicated, but once you start finding out more about what fiat money actually is, you'll marvel at how simple bitcoin is in comparison.

Banks don't lend out money that people deposit with them. They create new money every time somebody wants a loan. This cannot happen with crypto.
Also reserve banks and governments don't guarantee bank deposits because they have a huge pool of money waiting in the wings, they do it because they have the power to print new money if they need to. Of course, this would never actually happen because it would trigger runaway inflation... but it gives people a warm fuzzy feeling to hear it. And in a trust based currency, warm fuzzy feelings are literally what give it value.

"A blockchain needs to do two things: gather and order data into blocks, and then chain them together securely using cryptography."
No, that is Git. A blockchain needs a proof of work algorithm to select the correct chain and make it immutable. 
Boggles my mind that an entire organisation can completely miss the point. I know they are just using it as a buzzword to dazzle mediocre middle managers into buying their other awful consulting services, but still. If they had actually tried to implement a blockchain, they would have realised this.

"enterprise blockchain" - I'm genuinely fascinated to meet someone on the inside of this. Obviously there is no such thing as an enterprise blockchain in real life, so what does your team do? Is it all just ideas stage stuff?

This is hopelessly inaccurate, and a remains a persistent myth even among many with economics degrees. 
The reality of how it happens is equally (maybe more) disturbing, but the idea that banks lend out money from depositors is nothing more than a childish fantasy.
Banks do not need to wait for a deposit before they lend out funds. If you are interested in how it really works, the best explanation I have seen yet is from the Bank of England here:

It doesn't even come close to solving that "problem". Prism relies on an Oracle outside of the blockchain to tell all the "smart" contacts what to do. It's no more trustless than a betting website.
