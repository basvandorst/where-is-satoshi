I don't think there is a cold storage wallet manufacturer that doesn't offer BIP0038 encryption.

I'm using some of these "cryo cards". Fire-proof, flood-proof, scratch-proof (they claim) stainless steel BIP38 cold storage cards [cryobit.co](

Ah, I assumed your concern was key theft. In that case I guess you're right. Though you could always order to a friend's address or something and pay in BTC (I'm assuming most of these guys accept it).

I kind of selfishly wish OP had one so their claims could be tested. I recently bought some from them and emailed them to say thanks and they looked great. They told me that they were floating the idea of card recovery whereas if your card was destroyed to a point beyond their guarantee that they would replace it for free. Of course this means they would have to hold onto customers' keys...but then again they are BIP38 encrypted. I told them they should have the option to save or destroy the BIP38 keys when submitting the order, because key backup could be huge.

Don't quote me on this but I believe they only accept encrypted private keys. I've played around with ordering one before (kind of expensive), but I know they use bitaddress.org to generate encrypted keys but also will accept your own privately generated (however you want to) address/encrypted key pairs for orders

If you don't mind, can you elaborate on how you set them up? Are they using bitpay to accept payments? Is their waitstaff trained to accept it?
