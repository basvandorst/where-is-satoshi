guys so if a trezor is the best choice to store your bitcoin, what happen if the you broke the little device ? will you have a backup or something ?

okay thanks, but is it safe to use always the same public key to receive funds ? because many web wallets tend to generate new bitcoin receive address when you request payment nowadays

thanks so much everyone! appreciate the help!

thank you, I think I'll consider buying a hardware wallet then

trezor is 100% safe ? don't these people who make these hardware wallets always leave a backdoor to the products they make ?

cool, I was thinking the same. thanks for your answer. Can you please tell me is there anyway to generate a new public key for every transaction you make to a paper wallet, or you can only use always the same public key
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:13:15
sure, but I want to know your opinion, do you think their devices are trust worthy ?

which web wallet you think is the best ? coinbase ?
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:49:57
I checked it letter by letter more than 3 times and it is correct.

Hey thank you for your answer, Do you think Electrum is a safe way to import your paper wallet private key to ? (ofcourse if your computer is clean and has no malwares)

actually what I did is :
1) format HDD
2) generate bitcoin wallet address (offline)
3) write down on a paper (no print)
4) format disk again
5) connect to the internet and use the public key to receive funds
