Dont buy btc. What u want to do is buy into an alt right before the fork cause all the btc money will be flowing back into alts u will double up quicker. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:14:39
Btc cash ath is in the 1000's. I dont know the exacty price but its roughly 1500 give or take a couple hundo 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:01:33
Yes. What i was saying was to take the money that u are thinking about buying btc with and wait to put it into a alt. Btc is a good buy right now since people are gonna be pulling out of the alts to get there forked money which is essentially "free money". But now u can make a little money on btc and then buy into a alt that is gonna be roughly 60% of its actual price due to the fork. Either way u made the right move i suggest buying into alts a couple days before the fork which will be november 16 that way your in before it starts pumping. Also btc will have a pretty big correction after the fork i would say close 1500-2000 dollars down a week or two after. It will consolidate for quite a while

Idk but its way to early to buy into alts they are gonna come back down from this rally they were on btc will go back up one more time before fork 
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:40:33
Lol its always some fine ass women on these.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:44:24
Its not gonna stay in the low 5's but im guessin u can catch it at 5300 at the bottom  and then find some stability at around 6k 
I also think there will be one more btc pump before going back down we are to far away from the fork yet.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:05:20
U suck
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:10:29
Lol the ath is like 1600. thats not exact but its somewhere up there 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:07:57
Btc will correct. Stay in fiat and wait for another entry point. U will see it in the low 5000's again. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:15:19
My fault dude im thinkin im in bth sub im fuckin asshole 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:37:50

@_date: 2017-10-29 13:54:09
I have a buddy who would always buy pot from here. When he showed me it i was like dude wtf is btc and why dont u just buy it from our homie brandon. He had fuckin thousands of btc woulda been rich today at the moment but he just used em for erb. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:55:31
No i wish it would drop that low
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:11:12
How do u figure. Coinbase is supporting the fork. So people will be jumpin out of alts to get there fork money and then sell off to get back into alts. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:41:09
I think it will dip back down but not until after the fork. I think its going to go to mid 7's prefork.
