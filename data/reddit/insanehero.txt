Care to try again with a reply that is less emotion driven and more fact driven?
Coinbase is one of the longest living exchanges, many other exchanges have had way way worse problems. I’ve used it since 2013 and have never had an issue.

People need to stop blaming Coinbase for "market manipulation". Sure, there may have been some alleged insider trading going on, I can agree on that. However, I think their reasoning for shutting off trading was good in nature. The market was being manipulated, but not by Coinbase itself, more than likely a bunch of Bcash whales trying to drive the price up to cause hysteria. Coinbase realized this, and decided to block the pipe before it got more out of hand. Which takes guts imo, most exchanges would just let this sort of thing run rampant without stepping in.

Is the taxable value based on the exchange you received it on? It's hard to put an exact price on any cryptocurrency since the price fluctuates a lot just between exchanges.

It's likely Bitcoin cash will drop like a rock tomorrow. There was a $120 million dollar sell wall on gdax before trading went completely down.

What we saw today wasn’t a scaling issue, it was a liquidity issue which pumpers took advantage of. It wasn’t Coinbase itself that was manipulating the market.

I got to sell my garbage (BCH) at $5100 in the 30 seconds that trading did work, so I'm ok I guess.

Be a rational human being and think pragmatically about the cause and affect of things. Coinbase is currently the easiest and most user friendly way for people to get into crypto. With all the crypto hype recently its caused a massive influx in traffic to their platform, so naturally when you have such an unpredictable influx there’s going to be some scaling issues. Those support tickets aren’t going to get answered right away because the amount of users registering on their site has literally 10x in the last month or two. 
Coinbase isn’t just an empty room with one guy sitting in a chair twiddling his thumbs thinking about the next best way he can fuck over a customer.

All that gold isn't even worth one bitcoin.

and now it's back up at 10700, this is so entertaining I haven't left the gdax screen in over an hour.
