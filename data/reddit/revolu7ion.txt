Sure 10,000 swat teams later all around the globe and they still wouldn't accomplish anything except make it easier to mine bitcoins and let a new wave of miners join the fun. Like playing whack a mole and every node taken out makes 3 more pop up.

How do you suggest we "shut it down"? Point a gun at the computer screen? Make angry tweets demanding people to stop using and declare it's made from thin air? Maybe we could say only criminals use it and you're a bad boy if you do it too.

TA is not about predicting the future. It's about reacting to what's happening. Trading is more money management than it is predicting the future. Anyone trying to predict the future will find they are wrong constantly. Nobody can predict the future reliably but anyone can have a plan for what to do when price goes up or when it goes down.

The coin reward miners will receive will halve from 25 bitcoins to 12.5. This is because there will only be a fixed 21 million bitcoins created and like gold, bitcoin becomes harder and harder to mine. Bitcoin is deflationary which rewards savers for HODLING in the long term. :)

Gyft also takes bitcoin and it covers a bunch of stores including most pizza places. Plus you get points which can discount future orders.

Coinigy does a free video every two weeks and they go over btc and various altcoins suggested by the audience. Brian has 20+ years trading markets. Great way to start understanding the basics.
