This is way too much conjecture, and an uncomfortably large amount of presumptive arrogance.
First, you're pitting *vaporware* against working code, and you expect developers to just *swallow* it up?




And yet *you* are the one proposing we use vaporware to solve actual problems?
You also presume increasing the block size is an "existential threat" to Bitcoin, I disagree completely and so does Satoshi Nakamoto:


Seeing as you're so concerned over mining centralization, are you a supporter of Proof of Stake? Because in no proof of work system is it plausible for the world not to converge around centralized mining farms. Efficiencies of scale guarantee hashing power will become increasingly centralized and there's nothing you can do about that.

Black market users and Counterparty or colored coins users represent the only major users of Bitcoin-by-necessity. That's the root of the demand problem. There's a night and day difference between buying bitcoin because you need to, and buying bitcoin because you "believe" in it. Bitcoin will only stabilize once the Bitcoin-by-necessity userbase represents the vast majority of all Bitcoin users.
Bitcoin developers need to accommodate on-chain use cases like stock trading and prediction markets. Nothing like a trillion dollar market that requires BTC for fuel to generate demand.

You'd get to use Bitcoin with the same BIP32 SPV wallets everyone else is using.

If Bitcoin stagnates, a block size increase shouldn't matter to scalability improvement proposals. Scalability improvements will continue to be worked on with or without a block size increase.
And there will be more adoption. Multisig cold storage solutions will become the mainstay of Bitcoin companies and users, which is how it is today and how it will be in the future no matter what you believe about sidechains or scalability. How often do the majority of *your* bitcoin holdings leave cold storage? Rarely - so why would anyone expect everyone's favorite pet solution to be bigger than the main blockchain in terms of adoption? The majority of BTC is held in cold storage today on the main chain, and I don't see any innovation turning around this dominant usage model.
This makes freezing block size more asinine than scorched earth: freezing the block size ends the individual's ability to use the mainstay blockchain. Freeze the blocksize and Bitcoin itself will have failed to become, quoting the whitepaper:


because in a twist of irony, those same financial institutions would be the only ones to afford using the main blockchain.
Thin client systems operated over Tor - are they really so bad? If you lived in a country in which Bitcoin was banned, would you rather the rest of the world be running full nodes, or for everyone else in the world to be using Electrum on Tails? People are in good faith and with no irony recommending blatantly unworkable solutions for the people who need Bitcoin most. The user needs you to be using Electrum on the Tor network, so that they can mix their transaction histories together with the rest of the world's network connections in one big, anonymous melting pot. You would be using Electrum rather than Bitcoin-QT under adverse conditions, and these conditions should be optimized for. It provably works today, and scales independent of a person's willingness and ability to run a full node.

Very inspiring.

How do untrusted nodes join the network? It looks like raft is ok if it's controlled by only one organization.

Then why was Willy able to make trades during MtGox outages when no one else could trade?
It had to be running on their internal servers.

The Foundation should offer market making and security certifications for Bitcoin exchanges.

If you're a US citizen with over $10k in BTC, beware of the *onerous* reporting requirements for depositing coins on a foreign based centralized exchange.

Ease of use is the issue. There is no instant gratification to running a full node.
You can visit Blockchain.info more easily than you can boot up a full node. So more people will do that than run full nodes. You're already in your browser, so why not?
Even if websites could offer you a full node in-browser client-side service, there's no conceivable way they could offer it while still upholding your privacy and security which almost completely defeats the purpose of running a full node.
Early adopters of Bitcoin, technophiles:
    people using Bitcoin (100%)
    |--------------------------------------------------|
    people running full nodes (6%)
    |---                                               |
    people who claim they would run full nodes if bandwidth costs went down (24%)
    |------------
    people who would *actually* run full nodes if bandwidth costs went down (10%)
    |-----
**The future**
Mainstream global acceptance:
    people using Bitcoin (100%)
    |--------------------------------------------------|
    people running full nodes (2%, if that)
    |-                                                 |
    people who claim they would run full nodes if bandwidth costs went down (24%)
    |------------
    people who would *actually* run full nodes if bandwidth costs went down (4%)
    |--
Few people today, and even fewer people tomorrow, do or will complain about their inability to run a full node. Of those people who make complaints, very few if any will pan out into serious 24/7 full node users running with port 8333 open for making more than 8 connections consistently. The problem, in short, is a lack of dedication.

If a school bully demands your lunch money payable only in pixie sticks, that doesn't make pixie sticks the center of the universe.
If the US government demands 25% of your salary payable only in USD, and no one gives a shit about the USD otherwise because they have most of their wealth in BTC, it follows that the USD will become the pixie stick for the schoolyard bully. If there's no other reason for having it, people won't want to hold it.

As Satoshi said, most people will run thin clients that connect to full nodes run by specialists.


This is the workable approach for mainstream users. In reality, the failsafe solution is Tor. Tor should be a best practice in Bitcoin, whether or not you believe in block size limits. When much of our network traffic is mixed, we no longer have to worry about thin client privacy. A secondary benefit is the internet itself becomes a haven for free speech.
Tails with Electrum installed by default is the right idea. It provides an actually workable, scalable solution independent of block size and a person's willingness to run a full node.

Bloom filtering SPV clients have to connect to peers over unencrypted connections and therefore offer extremely limited privacy guards.
But, imagine everyone was using Tor Browser. What difference would it make if a website kept logs then? What would the NSA gain by collecting a ghost's web browsing habits?
Electrum uses SSL authenticated SPV, which is different and better than bloom filtering. Hence, you get the same privacy benefits with Electrum clients and servers over Tor as you would with visiting websites on Tor Browser.
If everyone used Tor as the best practice that it deserves to be, the Bitcoin address groupings and balances gleaned from monitoring servers would be just as worthless as ghost data collected from Tor Browser users by websites. One big mixing bowl.


In an extreme case, let's say Russia where Bitcoin is illegal and dangerous to be caught using, it is **more necessary** that everyone uses Tor as a best practice. Only then can desperate users blend in with other network traffic. Electrum over Tor scales today, it's extremely lightweight which is actually a benefit when circumstance are dire. The world needs more Tor users.

The most important concern is whether the supply of Bitcoin will remain fixed at 21,000,000 BTC. If it remains fixed, we gain a global currency of fixed supply that can't be debased by politicians or printed ad infinitum to bail out bankers. Is that not the main point of Bitcoin for you?
I've been at this since 2012, and I've never once used a full node as my main wallet. Sure, I've run a full node, but it's like, why? Honestly, why? I'm *perplexed* by the number of people who still use Bitcoin QT. Just being brutally honest, but did you guys miss the memo or want to turn back the clock to 2009 when running a full node doesn't require work and hours of waiting? Just use Tor and Electrum. It doesn't cost you your privacy that way. It's also the only wallet approach that scales independent of block size or a person's willingness to erect a full node.
Bitcoin will remain diametrically opposed to the current financial system regardless of how many or how few people run full nodes. So long as there are *enough* full nodes to provide health for the network, that's good enough. A global currency of fixed supply alone *is* the paradigm shift.
But I guess intelligent people can disagree.
