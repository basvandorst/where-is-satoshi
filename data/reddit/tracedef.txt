If you can't easily explain to your technology unaware mom how to safely use and store bitcoin in a minute or two, then bitcoin is not ready for public consumption. Perhaps bitcoin is not the final crypto that will find widespread adoption unless it can cross this hurdle. That's in addition to resolving the existing issues with its toxic ecosystem, infighting and other ongoing issues that are plaguing it.

Well liquidity is actually a thing and time has value. So if there is no volume, there is a time cost in waiting to see if an order will be filled. There were two trades total for the month of October for less than 1 bitcoin and 58 total trades since April. What part of the concept am I not understanding?

The ecosystem is toxic enough as it is .... no way.

Their cheesy looking logo and website hardly instill the confidence one would expect from a Financial Services company.
