nice too see a libertarian coin finally get ground. Bitcoin will be really nice for rich people like me to secure my wealth against the poor low IQ people. Bircoin will make taxation impossible and give the intelectulla population even greater power and more resources. Bitcoin will make the poor be forced to work 12 houers a day and spend 80% od rheri income on food. Many will finaly die. Atm we keep unproductive explorable people alive for no reason. Scuh shame Hillary lost. she could really give the give us better humans the tools we need to combat the poor scums. Great news is this. Death to the lower incomes classes

why don't you code something useful instead of supporting a multi-billion dollar scam? you would do the world a better favour writing an app that track my ass. But unlike bitcoin, my ass is reall and has a function.

to say fiat is "those with military might" to "the consensus of the users" is a grave simplification that has no value because it just looks at one aspect of a very complex matter. How would a world with a that blockchain and bitcoin as the main monetary system and object of exchange look like? How would an economy with a none inflationary currency look like? Is it not good that the people by vote can elect a government who then can carry out monetary policies and economic stimulation? Taxes? Safty for the individual.  A society without ruling are not free. In the wild, you might gain positive right but you lose all your negative rights. Something libertarians and government hating people forget

if bitcoin is a stock than it's useless. If it is a currency it has no meaning comparing it to stocks. Make up your mind ambiguous scamers 
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:04:28
dont worry. Bitcoinecd failed before it even was created. it's idee is flawed 
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:22:28

most of the costs are food and rent. Which are not affected by the drop in value compared to the other currencies. It's also good if the SEK gets a bit cheaper. Have been really high lately. You cant even compare SEK to bitcoin. Men tro på ditt bitcoin som är så säkert. 100% spekulativ och bitcoin har inte en chans. Forsätt drömma liberatarian tönt

there is no one that is so poor they don't have debit cards....
Cause everyone gets 1200 dollar in social securities and that is not paid in cash. You don't pay frees on your debit card so I can't really see how the poor in Sweden would be affected if you don't count in illegal immigrants and begging gypsis.

How come that everytime someone criticizes bitcoin they are uneducated and don't understand. Maybe they understand it and just don't like it?  Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are no inherent good. There are positive and negative effects related to many things in society. It all comes down to what you value most in and how you want the economic system to look
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:41:59
I dont see bitcoin being easier than card for elders to use. Itäs basically only elders that are effected by the strive to cashless soceity. The younger/middle age already embrace it. So bitcoin is in no way going to replace cash since anonymity is not the reason people want cash in sweden. If anything it's good so it gets harder for criminals to use it and for the black market to flurish.

it is indeed a good way to scam people by speculation in a worthless asset
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:47:57
we will see. one thing you forget is that bitcoin is incorporated and backed by extreme libertarians that only care about making themselves rich or to try crash the state. But most countries are conservative or right-liberal state hugger and friends of a big state. There also a ton of social-liberals and socialists that think redistribution of wealth, regulation and taxation are fundamental and important aspects of there way to run the country/state. Bitcoin has no place in a world that becomes more social awareness. Sure in a world with failing and bad states a crypto like currency maybe can be something positive. But at the moment there is no good reason for bitcoin if you care about society, equality and sustainability.
