Being first on the market is definitely a very good thing and being 900th doesn't have to be a bad thing also. It depends on your product quality and customer base too. We already have more than 15 customers.

Hi vampirism,
We are not trying to spam. We actually post once in few days, and spam is really not our intention, I apologise for that. Regarding legitimacy, there is a real german company standing behind this product and I can give you more info in a private message. We invest heavily in advertising but as you might have noticed our product has a really specific market and reddit is perfect source of potential customers. We have 6 customers who bought directly from reddit. If you are still interested in trying this out send me a message.

It looks like binary file is being opened in a browser with wrong header. It's a good thing though, because those scripts have backdoors and will steal your bankroll sooner or later. If you want to run a real casino check out [BitBox](

Hi! Yes, it's a self hosted solution or it can be hosted by us (depends on package). Security is our main priority here, so we fallowed all the highest standards when implementing and deploying. For technical backend stuff you can send me a pm with questions and I'm sure I can answer.
