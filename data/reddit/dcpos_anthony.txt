[DC POS - How It Works](
DC POS is a point-of-sale system we have developed that enables over-the-counter merchants, or any service provider, to easily accept bitcoin in exchange for their goods and services. It's easy to use &amp; supports a choice of wallet/payment processor providers.  Our page has straight-forward guides to the merchant process of accepting bitcoin for your over-the-counter goods.
We enable choice of wallet and rate providers, and offer great reporting tools and user-level controls. Merchants can easily select and change between 4 different wallet/payment processor providers - BitPay, Coinjar, Blockchain.info and Coinbase, and the list is growing. It is hardware, OS, and browser agnostic.  It runs on any tablet or smart-phone.  This freedom of choice gives merchants access to payment, banking and storage arrangements that best suit them. 
Many merchants that use DC POS use either a BitPay, or CoinJar intra-day hedging feature, that allows a merchant or service provider to never need to know anything about bitcoin. They get paid in bitcoin at a hedged conversion rate, the amount is transferred into their BitPay or CoinJar wallet, and they get the original purchase amount, paid in the fiat currency of their choice, transferred to their account at the end of the day. You charged $50 for an eyelash extension?  You get $50 in your account at the end of the day.

@_date: 2014-05-30 05:28:22
It's an interesting premise, but not really that much of a game-changer.  The bill of dish isn't going to be coded in bicoin, but dollars.  The purchase of bitcoins will be in dollars.  How much money did you spend on bitcoin with dollars?  How many dollars did you spend with bitcoin?  The amount of money you have earned in profit is the difference between those two values, plus the amount of bitcoins you have, converted to dollars.  Basically, the same as if you were trading stocks.
The only issue you'll have is if you hold bitcoins and they go up in value.  You'll have to pay tax on that capital gain.  If it does down in value, it's a capital loss, and a tax deduction.  You think you're getting a capital gain on your cash?  haha... err... no.  Remember... you're already paying the stealth tax in inflation, that this system is designed (broadly) to counter-act.  In a perfect world, the value of bitcoin will go up by the value of inflation.
I'm not seeing too many down-sides here.

Between one and three seconds.  It's generally faster than the local POS systems that are used here like eftpos.
You can, of course, try it to confirm.  By setting up the application on your tablet and using a wallet, you can use it immediately to test, 'out of the box' so to speak.
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:38:52
In a merchant system, either you provide a public key (so that people can pay you) in the context of having your own wallet, or you use a payment processor which does this on your behalf, giving you a public key for the same purpose.  You are relying upon the processor to reconcile the value to your account.
This is not all bad. In the context of DC POS with the coinjar payment processor, this reconciliation happens at the end of every day.  The money gets put into your bank account. Realistically, the most you could ever lose, would be the sales of a day.  For that to occur, coinjar would effectively have to cease to exist.

Many merchants that use [DC POS](  use the [CoinJar]( intra-day hedging feature that does exactly this. They get paid in bitcoin, at a hedged conversion rate, the amount is transferred into their [CoinJar]( wallet, and they get the amount original purchase amount paid in fiat transferred to their account at the end of the day.
This method is faster, has less risk to the merchant, and is cheaper than either credit cards or eftpos.

@_date: 2014-07-11 01:33:58


Coinjar (and bitpay) already has a daily remittance to process.  If you use the [DC POS]( application, linked to either a coinjar or bitpay processing manager (depending on where you are) it will reconcile bitcoin into your account at the agreed currency value at the time of the transaction at the end of each day.
So yes, that's bitcoin wallet to fiat at agreed fiat value, into your bank account, end of every day.

Your complete premise on 0 confirmation transactions is incorrect, so I say, prove it.  Just because something is theoretically possible, doesn't mean it is going to happen.

We've tried to make a system for merchants that truly doesn't require much technical know-how, including the ability to reconcile into fiat at the end of every business day.  So we've found most of the adopters are simply merchants wanting to accept bitcoin in their bricks-and-mortar businesses, and aren't really part of the bitcoin community.

@_date: 2014-09-11 00:18:07
While I agree that that sounds like an attempt to corner a payment method, there are two things that are proposed there.  I can see that as an attempt to ring-fence the consumer/merchant experience, which I don't think is going to succeed, but hey... good luck.  Either way though, they'll be using bitcoin/blockchain as the transaction medium, and that means more consumers using it.
I think they're looking at this from the perspective of a Visa, which has an underlying structure of dollars.  You need a visa card, and a visa terminal, but you're still transferring dollars.  Like I said, I don't think they're going to succeed, but in the end, for bitcoin, more transactions means more adoption, and that can only be good for the greater use of the technology.

The [DC POS platform]( using the coinjar feature, allows you to price in au dollars.  It will then reconcile the value to your account in au dollars at the price you entered at the end of the day.  Faster reconciliation than eftpos or by credit card.  The only real exposure to the bitcoin price is at the time at which the customer agrees to the transaction.  
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:53:43
The confirmation on a credit card transaction is 60 to 90 days. At any time in that time the transaction may be reversed and the merchant is out of pocket.
There is far greater risk using a credit card and not getting paid then there is using a bitcoin transaction.

This is a typical fallacious argument used by libertarians.  The issue for them, is that their criticisms of mandated health coverage is not borne out in the facts, only in their failed premise that 'government control is bad'.


Which, of course, didn't happen.


Because the total cost of health-care, per consumer, decreases, when health care moves from crisis care to preventative care.  That happens as a result of mandating health-care coverage, regardless of who pays.
The issue for libertarians, is that this reality is borne out in the experience of every other health-care system in the world.  America is finally starting to do what every other industrialised government has known for the better part of half of a century.

Like I said, DC POS is not a market-place.  It is an API to allow developers to accept bitcoin using the existing wallets on peoples phones, and the money goes directly into their account, where they can have it reconciled into cash at the end of the day.
~~But the observation still applies.  You won't allow apps that accept bitcoin directly into your system either, just like google play.  It's not a criticism, just an observation.~~  And the original poster of this discussion was talking about a decentralized app store, and that isn't actually what skubit is.
Good luck though!  The more options the better, I say.

Anyone can install an android app on any phone.  You just can't advertise it through the google play store.
And there-in lies the problem with the google play store.  Unlike the Apple store, people just don't trust Google with their credit-card details.  I'm not saying it's a valid concern, but it's just the way it is.  So people download lots of free apps from the google play store, but the conversion rate to actual money spent is about 1/30th of the apple store.

Does the money come through you to them?  Then it isn't decentralized.    Placing your distros on different servers doesn't make it decentralized.  And when you close down, it closes down.
Like I said, you provide a service, and it's good that you're out there.  I'm not criticizing, because it's important to have the service that you provide.  I hope you find lots of people who benefit from it.

DC POS takes 0.5% of every transaction.
Don't get me wrong, I think there's a place for a service like skubit.  You provide a market-place to search for apps, and DC POS doesn't.  However, you stand as a middle-man in between the consumer and the developer, ~~so even when developers create applications using the API that DC POS provides, they're not going to be let onto your system, because~~ the DC POS API delivers funds directly from the consumer to the developer.  Payments usings the DC POS API circumvent even the skubit market-place.
So you're basically doing the same thing as the google play store, except you're providing a bitcoin payment option for consumers as well.  I suppose you have a different class of applications allowed as well, like adult content.  But so does a service like Mikandi.  So there's a place for it, like I said.  But for developers who want to deal directly with consumers, without having to pay large commissions, the DC POS API is far less expensive.
PS.  And skubit is not decentralized either.

Really?  Even if they circumvent payment to Skubit at all?

The frustrating thing is that it isn't where the money is.  The Apple store is where the regular consumer money is.  I suspect the great bulk of the revenue that the google play store earns is through companies buying access to android apps for their user-base.  The rate of conversion for users to money spent is about 1:30 between android and apple.
If google really wanted to change that, they'd allow gambling and adult content.  Apple will never allow that.  
That's where the money is.

How many internet start ups from the 90's are still around?
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:32:07
Over half the revenue, but with 5 times as many users, and that small percentage of apple users spends five times as much per user as the android user does.
There's lots of material about this :
I wish it wasn't so, but it is.  I've worked out the actual numbers, and am too tired to say the same thing again.  The only thing in dispute is the magnitude of the disparity between the platforms.  The reality is the regular joe doesn't spend money through the google play store.
