Thanks for the detailed reply.  I don't usually post, having been lurking.  But I do find it interesting, the passion behind some explanations.  
I appreciate many of the points you've discussed there.  I am using segwit enabled wallets, and I am going to read more into Lightening network.  My concern is that it still feels like a patch, even though the solutions are well engineered.  My gut feeling leans towards a change to core rather than additional layers, but if it seamlessly fits in and is standard issue, then it could well be the savior of Bitcoin for the long term.  But the argument that it requires every node to get on board, well these alternatives also require people to use them to make Bitcoin useful.
My thoughts are compounded by the fact that a number of commercial vendors (high profile) have dropped support for bitcoin.  Maybe out of protest, but certainly out of lack of viability (fees, time).  Lets hope they find LN and segwit a viable solution that everyone adopts.

What is the benefit of Segwit / Lighting Network over a seemingly simple block size increase?  Other than miner greed?  These other solutions seem to simply be a sticking plaster instead of a fundamental fix?  Or am I missing something?
Organisations are dropping bitcoin support for the delays and price... caused by competition to get your transaction in the block.
Please share your thoughts!
