What about an Ebay type system?
if you saw the price falling, and you were afraid of loosing your bitcoin at 200, so you bought someone's computer with it at 600? 
All these companies are putting money into building a bitcoin trading platform, but shouldn't they be building a bitcoin market?

I wish it was considered common sense. read the comments :( 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:42:45
book marked! thank you!

unless the site was a craigslist / ebay type system where it was hey use your bitcoins to buy something you personally need / want. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:42:35
Okay, so If there was a website that allowed you to find ANYTHING you wanted to buy with bitcoins, would you?
or if there was a website that used your bitcoins to pay your bills in cash? what about then?

Nah i'm just saying that... the price of it is high because people hold on to it, and then when something bad happens EVERYONE SELLS which causes the price to drop dramatically. I guess stabilize was the wrong word, but i meant if poeople were like "Oh shit China just announced they cant use bitcoins" so people sell them at 640 
if they instead bought something at 640, wouldn't that make it so the price didn't drop so greatly?

"Don't sell your bitcoins if you're worried about the price dropping, because you're making it drop more"
 -- oh this is to people who want it to become a legitimate means of currency, who are getting fucked by the people who are only trying to gain money from it.

oh my, 
I mean, i was posting this to give advice to those who are actually interested in it being a legit currency but scared to lose money so they're thinking about selling. You make it sound like because I posted that, there will be someone out there in the world going "I WANT TO SELL.... BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT REDDIT POST. I CAN'T" 
It is a free market, and you're right. My own personal gain is not at all what I'm interested in, considering i have hardly any invested in bit coins. I just hate that a system that is thriving starts to decline when a government (known for banning things) bans it.  I mean, Bitcoin was made so governments don't have an influence, yet here we are.
Its like this:
* China Announces no one can fuck with bitcoins 
* Everyone in china starts getting rid of them to markets, and the prices begin to naturally go down.
 
* people see the prices going down, and then they hear about China. Their reaction is  "SHIT THAT MUST BE BAD, LETS SELL THEM NOW"
*Price begins to drop, effecting everyone who has bitcoins 
*People who got in it for money, see that it was 900 yesterday and today its 650 today, they assume that bit coin fad is over, and start selling. 
* we continue the downward spiral.
Instead, if the point was to get rid of them at the value, they should be sold for cash to someone who is interested in using them for whatever purposes they may be ( to trade for goods, or to hold on to hoping the value increases). They could then get the money or the good that the bit coin was valued at, without affecting the entire chain.

because putting quotes are the word right means that it wasn't made to be used as a currency to spend on products :P 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:28:02
this post was meant to be a hypothetical bitcoin-like Ebay. If you continuously just buying products or getting cash for your bitcoin for someone else who would buy a product. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:15:40
I actually don't know if it ever has. I'm just imaging a way bitcoins could be sold without really affecting the overall value. 
now if only a developer sees this :P

you come face to face with the facts. 
do you:
* 1. eat the pizza
* 2. Sell the pizza for less than you paid, who will sell it for less than he paid, who will sell it for less than he paid. 
* 3. let the pizza mold
