But he will have to pay shed loads of tax so as normal the government win.

Yes plus mass adoption Is a longgggggg way off. I tried to sell 0.5 btc last night to a group of fellow crypto traders and no one offered me anywhere near it’s true fiat value. I had to feed the coinbase beast in the end. £92 to sell half a btc plus 0.001 btc to transfer it from bittrex to coinbase. Not to mention all the fees for selling my alts to btc.

Thank you

I don’t claim to be a tech but other coins can handle more transactions. If they are making improvements make it common knowledge talk about it instead of slagging ( none tech people ) off.

Very true but if we’re talking mass adoption it just doesn’t work. If we’re changing the world people need to be able to use it for everything. I don’t have a 100k neither does 99% of the worlds population.

Nice one man.

I could 100% enjoy talking to you about this stuff over a beer I like you take. Thanks for the point of view

I hope so I love crypto. My only concern is how will they scale how many forks are we gonna see. There are so many better coins than btc in my opinion. Maybe I’m just pissed cause I looked at it when it was $800 and thought hell no that’s to expensive. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:03:51
This is exactly what I mean when I say there are better coins to use as actual currency.

Your not even considering the market manipulation though. It doesn’t treat everyone one the same whales can make the market move can’t they ? 
Also it won’t be long till the government does something to take control back if btc becomes to disruptive. 
I think your point of view is naive but I like it and wish I could think the same way. I look forward to being proved wrong. Your clearly more well informed than me Ill concede that.

Has everyone here forgotten that btc is actually pretty fucking useless as a currency. You could go buy a car and by the time you have finished the transaction said car could be $1000 + or - depending on the swings

I totally agree the world is a mess. Btc isn’t the answer though the same people that got rich from destroying lives in the banking crises are getting even richer in crypto.

I’m sorry but that’s crazy why give a kid that much for Christmas.

Would say ignorant as I’m a normal person. That being said I am involved in crypto and actively read and engage in the subject so if I don’t know imagine what the general public don’t know. 
And thanks I’ll have a read

Ok that’s good news then. What about the crazy transaction fees that make it useless as a currency. Or is that intentional. I certainly DO NOT think they are stupid I think it’s many clever people with many different ideas.

What about the High fees every time you deposit on coinbase ???
