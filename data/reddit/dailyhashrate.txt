Thanks for the tip! I've posted it there as well!

My fault. Don Santiago came in with some crazy LSD pickled mushrooms and I ate them before I submitted and then I submitted.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:55:03
Did you let Facebook slip through your fingers?
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:51:41
Whaddaya mean?
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:33:21
The one you submitted was better for your submission title.
@_date: 2014-12-15 04:01:45
Maybe we'll spend it reading your site, what's the URL?
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:10:04
What, your mom?

@_date: 2014-11-25 18:01:14
Now that's just jealousy.
@_date: 2014-12-10 03:37:20
pffft, they're trash.
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:42:28


Sorry, we didn't look up any pics of Mr. iPad Chain with his shirt off like you did.
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:34:00
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:49:26
They'd better.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:24:07
You know, we almost did the same concept for this story:
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:38:56
Dogecoin is worthless.
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:03:47
Don't worry  is still up!
@_date: 2015-05-07 02:47:26
stupid is as stupid does
@_date: 2015-05-02 14:42:21
Actually it's a good recap of some of the shit Garza's been involved in. Why don't you point out some of the grammatical errors so we can fix them and make it a better Josh Garza hit piece?
@_date: 2014-11-18 22:52:26
They did?
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:57:18
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:00:03
Pffft. He can't afford us.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:13:51
What the fuck! All we do all day is nail Josh Garza for being a dick and no one hacks us! We could use the publicity! 
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:28:04
Aw, thanks for the re-tweet.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:50:26
Pffft. We wish, at least we'd be getting laid.
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:04:36
@_date: 2015-01-09 03:20:53
oops, we did it again.

CoinFire and The Daily Hash Rate are the only two Bitcoin news sources with any credibility.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:32:38
Thanks for gold!
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:36:18
What's journalism?
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:44:01
Our other stuff is much better, I promise.
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:02:15
Thank you!

This aggression will not stand man.
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:27:35
No, that would be  We're a solid second rate onion.
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:12:24

Already done:
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:58:26
What? Just like the video shows: Adam's announcement is that he's going to be an ice cream company spokesman.
He delivered.

That's a fancy way of saying gas prices are going fucking crazy.


Are you a fan of the fed? What the hell are you doing in this sub? I'd take CNBC's opinion over yours 


Except if you're going to retire and your portfolio is biotech heavy.

We already reported it: 
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:35:45
Asked the government shill whose account was 3 hours old.
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:57:53
Injected the 2 month old sock puppet account.
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:53:56
Only when their account is 3 hours old. Besides, look at their name. "45543" does that look like an account that has any kind of personality behind it? Do they even care bro?
