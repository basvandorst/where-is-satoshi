Mind if you share some of the links in a  PM? That seems like a real good gauge to tell if someone is serious or not.

I know this happened last time, are they spamming again?

I commited Seppuku and died in a field of green grass. Fuck this shit lol.

Why are the fees so crazy right now?
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:58:54
Yeah, I NEVER update WinRar. Thx for the heads-up!
@_date: 2016-06-24 22:54:35
I'm not comfortable giving them my social, but other than that, I filled out the whole form, it's been in pending status for months.

All my coins to and from coinbase go to my Electrum wallet.

In my correspondence with them, they never ask for an SS. I have 2 friends that I introduced to coinbase years back, who have given them essentially nothing as far as personal info goes, and to this day, they can buy and sell as they please(and have had limits increase over time). I have given them my Driver's license and I even threw them a bone and gave them another one of my gov't IDs and where I work, no dice.
If they had the same standards for all their customers and if their customer service didn't suck, I'd gladly comply. The way they operate, seems completely random and they can't(or won't) explain why my acc is limited. No bank I have ever done business with acts this foolish, I'm not going giving Coinbase the benefit of the doubt that they know what they're doing.

Its old school but not dumb. I have an old laptop that I basically gutted (no HDD, replaced RAM and wireless modem), and my comp boots off of the Tails DVD. Never used &amp; never stored at home. Nothing can be saved. If I accidentally bump my laptop, because its shitty, power is instantly lost, and I lose all my data. Slightly yank power cord, oops, dead laptop. If I drop dead and my laptop stays running by itself, because the battery is so bad, it will eventually overheat in a few hrs and power down on its own. It's a beautiful setup.

Yes. I had a modest limit of $100 a day. All of a sudden, it's reduced to $5. The more info I've given them over time, the more poor the service gets, which is why I'm hesitant with my SS number. Everything else I've given them.

Thanks for explaining instead of down-voting. Sold my position in BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:11:50
Wow you have to wait 10 years after moving there to get the 5%? That kinda sucks...
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:36:35
Ok, but how do we know their intent? I assume that they don't want to miss out on the free coins when the split occurs.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:43:44
Something will replace it eventually, but all this stuff it's in it's infancy right now. I'm just gonna enjoy this ride while I can.

Need some advice/pointers. I entered at around $5k with few coins. Re-upped around 6500. Since we've been bouncing between 7k-7.5k. I figured I set a trailing stop loss
@ 7437, with my trigger point set at 7k. It moved up and I exitted @ 7145. 
I'm happy because I'm in the green but can't shake this feeling that I left too early since it's slowly climbing again. The stop-loss, in a way, has set me free with profit, but I'm not sure what to do next.
Wait for a dip, cash out, buy back in now? I'm on the fence here.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:34:38
How do you check who's buying selling?
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:11:35
Great attitude
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:02:43
Yeah, I dont trust /btc either, didn't expect to get this much heat here for buying an alt-coin,but echo-chamber effect is real, just gotta roll with the punches.
Wow, I just checked the volume, never knew about this. How the hell does he have money like that to prop up the BCH market? Where did one trillion come from?
Edit: Trillion, not billion

If you have one for sale, please PM me, need a new gym water bottle anyways
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:08:56
Tagged. Hope for the best man.

I doubt their pockets are that deep.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:56:33
B4 I forget, how do I order from you, via amazon?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:36:01
Where is this 80% of miners number coming from?
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:22:07
Name of trader?
@_date: 2019-01-29 08:03:59
Sounds about right.
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:51:47
You're doing alot better than most do-nothings out here. They say that making the first million is always the hardest. Stay focused.
@_date: 2016-05-26 06:15:15
What about using mixers??
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:50:33
Coinbase will ban you with a quickness for cashing out gambling wins.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:29:11
