Read [Mastering Bitcoin](  There's a link to buy a print version on Amazon if you prefer that.


It was traded or just given away, not bought.  The concept was new, it had no quantifiable value to fiat, so it was swapped around for fun.  Sure there were a few private trades here and there which represented a value, but the first notable exchange of any substance was the infamous [10,000 BTC pizza]( (about US$25).  Someone offered 10k BTC to anyone who would buy two pizzas.  In 2010, exchanges started popping up to trade fiat for BTC.


Bitcoin-QT was the GUI software that had a built in wallet.  It generated random addresses and it stored the private keys in an encrypted data file.  Lose the file, lose the keys, lose the BTC.  Everyone owned and managed their own wallets on their own computers.  There was a story many years ago of a guy who mined BTC in the beginning and held 7,000 or so BTC in the wallet.  He had since thrown away the computer so he lost them.  Nowadays we have deterministic wallets which means you can restore all the secret keys from a single phrase (if you lose the computer but still have your phrase, you still have your coins).


Bitcoins are created in accordance with a set of rules.  At the beginning, it was 50 BTC per block.  The first block's coins cannot be spent, but it would have been 50 BTC.


Like I said, BTC are created in accordance to a set of rules on which we all agree.  "Mining" is just solving a mathematical problem.  The difficulty to that problem is another agreed upon rule.  You hash some data (block header and transactions) and you can represent that hash as a REALLY big number.  If your number is less than the calculated difficulty number, then you win.  Your prize is you are allowed to send a certain number of BTC to an address of your choosing along with the fees from any transactions you included when creating your hash.  So you literally create BTC out of thin air, but it's done in accordance with our rules so everyone accepts it.


At first it was a regular desktop computer.  Then it was found that GPU (graphics cards) are exceptionally efficient at solving that mathematical problem so then you needed several GPUs to mine.  Then it was discovered that instead of using someone else's ASIC on the GPU, you could design your own ASIC that did absolutely nothing but solve the math problem.  That's where we are today.

Other countries have already implemented public key identification.  But I think anyone with half a clue about PKI, trusted certificates and signing knows how much easier that would make life in general....the issue is voting out the old lawmakers to pave the way for new initiatives.
Selling a car by sending Bitcoin to an escrow via my phone, having the owner transfer the title to escrow via phone, instantly having the escrow realize the transaction is complete, escrow queries the state to have it sign the title transaction, and then escrow transfer the money and title immediately will happen someday.  Maybe not in my life, but we'll get there eventually.

1. Transfer any significant balance to a paper wallet.
2. After iOS releases a fix, start another wallet.
But unless you have dozens and dozens of games, utilities and other off the wall apps where the author could have gotten something approved, I wouldn't worry about it.  I'm sure Apple can identify the approved apps and remove them.  
Besides, the private key is stored on the iPhone and does not get copied via the keychain to OS X so you're fine on that front:
    id accessible = (authenticated) ? (__bridge id)kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly :
                    (__bridge id)kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly;

Cash|You control private keys.  Lose the key, lose the money.|You control the bills.  Lose the bill, lose the money.
Bank|You give your money to the exchange/online wallet.  They promise to keep it safe.|You give your money to the bank.  They promise to keep it safe.  The government guarantees it.

I [replied to someone else here]( with my CryptoLocker experience, but let me say this:
* Store your mission critical data on a central file server.
* Use ActiveDirectory security groups to control permissions.
* Use folder redirection via GPO for your workstations, this way the user data is also held on your file server.
* Use RAID10.  It doesn't have the write penalty of RAID5 and it protects against multiple drive failures.
* **Turn on volume shadow copy**.  Windows will make hidden backup copies of your files.  You can restore deleted files or roll back to previous versions.  Since it's built into windows, your employees can do this without involving you.
* **Use a cloud backup service**.  Get the data out of your facility to prevent against catastrophic loss.  I also understand that newer versions of these trojans seek out your volume shadow copies, too.
* Use a centrally managed anti-virus.  It's important to see who is what on what version and get notifications when it finds something.
I can't begin to tell you how screwed we would have been if I didn't have volume shadow copy enabled.  It's a 12TB array servicing 250 employees.

As far as  is concerned, I brought up encryption and random ports and one of the devs commented.  It was not met with good responses.
I had suggested using a system similar to [OTR]( because it not only hides the data you're exchanging from a snooping 3rd party, but it also creates plausible deniability in that even if someone captures and decrypts the transaction, you still cannot prove it actually took place.  The intent isn't to secure the bitcoin protocol, but simply to remove the middle man from seeing it happen.

47 CFR §97.113(5): *Communications, on a regular basis, which could reasonably be furnished alternatively through other radio services* (it could be argued that the internet furnishes the distribution and the amateur service is unnecessary)

This is like taping a $20 to your jacket and expecting to get mugged.

So are checks.  They take DAYS to clear; bit coin takes minutes to hours.  Write down the driver's license number of someone paying with Bitcoin just as you would with someone writing a check.
EDIT: I wanted to add, and perhaps this has already been discussed, but maybe a solution would be to check the sender address in the block chain to see if the funds are there.  It's not foolproof, like check kiting, but wouldn't it offer some level of assurance?


If you bury a mason jar of dollars somewhere and lose your memory, it's gone forever.  Unless you write down the location.  Like writing down your password or printing out your wallet key information.


Your comments focus on the Bitcoin supporters' negative reactions.  That's because it's largely a younger crowd using internet anonymity to sound off.  Regardless, people keep fiat money in exchanges all the time.  In fact, the brokerage firm holds your shares much like a Bitcoin exchange holds your Bitcoins.  It's unregulated, so you assume that risk; much like the fiat markets were unregulated 100 years ago.  Give it time.


You wouldn't hand over $500 in cash to a guy on the street who promises to come back in a few days with something, would you?  Of course not.  Same deal here.  Overstock is trust worthy, like giving cash to Best Buy.  You can't blame the currency for the ill intentions of the person providing the services/products.
All in all, the hardest part to comprehend is that this is dealing in cash.  It has the same pitfalls of fiat cash prior to government regulation; it's just none of us were alive back then to have first hand experience with that.

In my case, CryptoLocker was downloaded by an employee via IE.  It wiped out several terabytes of network shared data on Christmas Eve.
Fortunately, it held each file it encrypted in the registry.  I mounted the volume shadow copy as a folder, wrote a quick powershell script to read a text file dump of the registry keys that held the file list, and then copied the files back.
I suppose it could have been a lot worse.

Unfortunately, these are the analogies the average non-computer person understands.  I work in media, I've given radio interviews, and anything above that level is way beyond the comprehension of the average person.


Bitcoin is not instant confirmation like CC; the transaction does it immediately stop if there are insufficient funds at the point of sale.  It's just the way it is.  The closest analogy is allowing clearing time for checks, which takes days.  For Bitcoin, the clearance time is minutes/hours.  The concept is the same, though, regardless of whether you believe that "barely anybody uses [checks] anymore.".  A third party needs to verify the transaction took place, much like the clearance bank verifies the check.


The average person doesn't understand what a key is, what a wallet.dat is, or even how to handle a computer file.  The easiest way for them to understand forgetting your password or not printing out your key is to compare it to forgetting where you put your cash.


Again, the average person does not know a shady website from a legit website.  They click on phishing emails.  They freely give up banking info and passwords.  Making sure they understand a website can be just as shady as a guy selling stuff on the street is important (in general, not just for Bitcoin payments).
I think you grossly over estimate how the general population views things.  After all, they think there's an executive of Bitcoin.  Why?  Because to them a currency must be backed by someone or something.  This is why analogies that sound ridiculous to us are the only way the average person can even begin to understand and accept it.

I can understand you being dismissive and condescending because of what I said, but for all you know I invented it.  So please, give a listen to what I'm actually saying:
The streets are public.  You can see any car drive by.  But what you're doing is picking out a specific car, checking the plate, taking a pic of the driver, following it to its destination, and then asking around if anyone else noticed it.  Then everyone tries to identify the driver and speculate as to why he drove there and what he's doing.
Like I said, I understand it's a public ledger.  But you're picking out something specific and monitoring it, involving a bunch of people, and trying to "solve" it.
With all due respect, that's creepy.

Not quite.  I think there's a difference between helping run a public ledger in the background compared to looking at specific addresses for activity, then getting a bunch of people to try and figure out who it belongs to, why a transaction happened, and who now owns the new address.

I wonder if anyone has looked at compressing the data transfer, similar to how web servers can use gz deflate?
Just played around with some block data and achieved a 33% compression rate using LZMA2 on default settings (16MB dictionary size).  That would trim about 8 gigabytes of data transfer off synching the blockchain.  Combine that with the pruning everyone keeps talking for local storage.

A responsible gun owner would not put him/herself in that situation in the first place. Deadly force is for only the gravest extreme for which you have no other option. 
Always be mindful of your surroundings (meet at a police "online exchange" location). Always defuse the situation and leave (the minute it gets hairy, walk away).  Always retreat (don't back yourself into a corner and never stand your ground).  Never brandish (if you touch that firearm, it's because your death is imminent and immediate). 
The lawsuit from the other person, especially the wrongful death from their family if you kill them, plus the potential criminal charges if you improperly try and use judicious use of deadly force, will bankrupt you. The media attention  and likely jail time will ruin your life.

Every non-cash transaction in the world is unconfirmed until settlement. When you accept a check, that's even worse than 0-conf. When you accept credit card, that's equivalent to 0-conf (much like your client verifies the transaction is valid and will probably confirm, your bank authorizes the charge but hasn't actually given the merchant the money yet). 
This 0-conf thing is silly. The world has operated on 0-conf equivalents since the advent of non-cash instruments. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:55:04
Correct, you cannot transmit encrypted or otherwise obscured information.
However, one can assume that Bitcoin transactions and block data does not violate part 97 since the information being transmitted is publicly available and is not being obscured.  On a deeper level, you're merely *signing* transactions and computing checksums/hashes, which is to prove authenticity and not meant to obscure any meaning.  The only argument you could make is that by using the hash of the public key violates the law because you're intentionally obscuring the public key, but that's kind of a stretch since the generally accepted public format is the hash.

Ha. Mostly because I don't know to whom I'm talking. I want to portray OTP in a positive light, so telling someone to input the pre-shared key sounds intimidating. Much easier to say "hold up your phone, the app takes a pic, and the QR code contains everything needed to set it up."
I use 1Password. Tried LastPass a while ago and decided to go with 1Password for no particular reason. Prior to that I used Keeper, which I purposefully ditched.  I use a similar approach to you in that I trust the secure enclave and keychain in my iPhone....but again, to my original point, Apple no longer locks my account and throws away the key. Someone at Apple can unlock my data and keychain, which is why I don't want to answer security questions or have SMS. I want the old method of "here is your recovery key; if you lose it, tough."  That's just not very family friendly. 
To further improve security from this huuuuuge flaw, I treat those security questions as passwords. My "favorite elementary school teacher" is a randomly generated password.

[One Time Password]( It's that QR code you scan and your password manager generates a 6 number combo. 
There are only two people who know your key to create the correct 6 number combo: the issuer and you. The only transmission is their challenge (which provides no info), and your response (which is time sensitive and one-time  to prevent replay attacks).

Yeah, kind of like those old key fob code generators. The difference being the RSA fobs are pre-programmed at the factory while OTP generators read a QR code that contains the special info used to create the 6 numbers. 
Yes, OTP is crucial to the continued security in our connected world. Even Reddit, for an admin account, requires OTP. It's an open standard, most major players use it, and we need to discontinue the use of proprietary schemes, SMS, phone calls, etc. 
Even Facebook is a mess. It lets you set up OTP, but it will still text you when it challenges you. Wtf?

No, this happened specifically because of this recovery method. If they didn't have it, they wouldn't have been able to compromise the account. 
It's like putting your bitcoin on an exchange: you sign over the keys and you're at the mercy of the exchange. With phone and/or SMS recovery, you're at the mercy of a call center worker who would rather just "fix" the problem than hear the perp bitch them out.
Bottom line: with phone and/or SMS, you are not in control of your data as you don't have the final say. Think about that. Then think about how many accounts where you have SMS backup (or they're insane like eBay, PayPal, GoDaddy, etc and SMS is their primary 2-factor).

I'm glad this is finally getting traction.  I suggested this to the mailing list a few years ago and it was not well received.
That being said, I would hope port randomization is included as a recommended and default behavior when implementing end-to-end encryption.  Sure, the traffic is now encrypted but the port signifies what I'm doing.  As part of port randomization, I would hope the libraries for [NAT-PMP]( support are included as well (there's a [PCP]( extension to the library bitcoind uses).  Apple Airport Extreme routers don't support UPnP and instead use NAT-PMP.

Completely making this up off the top of my head, but here goes....
1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshi which means you break it down to 1 satoshi per vote plus standard fee.
When you register to vote, you get 1 satoshi + fee from that parent address that contained exactly 1 bitcoin (there can be multiple parent addresses to accommodate huge voting turnout).  Create a new wallet so your vote can't be tied to your other spending in your primary wallet.  After you vote, throw away the key.
To vote, you send that 1 satoshi and fee to the designated address for whom you're voting.  Voting begins at an exact UTC time, anything before that is disqualified.  Voting ends at an exact UTC time and the counting isn't complete until the last transaction in the mempool prior to the end date is confirmed.  For the vote to count, it must flow from a known parent address to your address to a known voting address.
The voting agency pays for the satoshi and fees, not you.  In fact, they can include a higher than average fee to preempt a spam attack.
This provides an exact voter turnout.  You'll know how many registered by how many satoshi were sent, how many voted by how many satoshi were received, and how many "hanging chads" you had by satoshi sent to the wrong address.
As for who can be a registered voter, if you're talking in the context of reddit, you do it like stock dividends.  All redditors as of a certain time with at least 1 positively rated post/comment are eligible (akin to owning a share of a stock).  Use the OAuth2 mechanism to verify the account.  Use a double blind mechanism where the person sending the voting satoshi has no knowledge of which hash is associated to which reddit account.

It uses EC multiplication which works like the RSA discrete log problem.
1. Pick a number from 1 to 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,852,837,564,279,074,904,382,605,163,141,518,161,494,336.  This is your Bitcoin private key.
2. Multiply the base point (55066263022277343669578718895168534326250603453777594175500187360389116729240, 32670510020758816978083085130507043184471273380659243275938904335757337482424) by that number (point doubling) modulo prime number 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,908,834,671,663.
3. Flip over the x-axis.
4. The result is your public key.
So the EC discrete log problem is not just cyclic, but the only way to figure out how many times you did the EC point doubling is to brute force all of them.  k * G (mod p).

This is a copy/paste of what I suggested elsewhere. The thought was to have a service act as the expert for the power of attorney or executor:
I’ve mentioned this before, but there should be a dead man’s switch service. You put your savings into 3 of 5 multisig where:
* Key 1 = owner. This is not shared and is lost when the owner dies.
* Key 2 = owner dead man’s key. This is in a safe place, like a safe deposit box, and is retrieved when the owner dies as part of the estate.
* Key 3 = power of attorney. Whomever is appointed power of attorney and/or executor is supplied their own key.
* Key 4 = the dead man’s service.
* Key 5 = owner revocation. This is not shared and is lost when the owner dies.
The will should indicate that the dead man’s service will assist the power of attorney or executor with crypto and surrender the funds to them as part of the estate.
That means:
* if the owner changes their mind, keys 1, 2, and 5 are known to the owner and can move the funds.
* keys 1 and 5 are lost upon death, so the executor contacts the service as outlined in the will. Keys 2, 3, and 4 are then assembled to move the funds.
* the service and/or executor are unable to defraud the owner because not enough keys are known (1, 2, and 5 are inaccessible and known only to the owner). Keys 3 and 4 are not enough to unlock the funds.
* the owner may then rest easy (dead or alive) knowing the savings are safe while alive and a crypto expert service is assisting the executor after death.

One vision of cryptocurrency was to use a single seed phrase (different from a pass phrase) for ALL of your coins.  You'd have a 12 word seed phrase and then each currency would be derived from that.  The addresses (keys) are derived using a path format so it's human readable.  For example:
    m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
That's short hand for "create the master key from your pass phrase, follow the BIP44 standard (hence the 44), use this for Bitcoin, account  external chain (the addresses you use to receive money from people), address   The apostrophe means you cannot create a chain of additional keys at that level.  Another example:
    m/44'/5'/6'/1/84736
That's short hand for Dash coin, account  internal chain (the change addresses you mentioned), address 
Essentially, it provides a way to keep track of all of the addresses you'll be generating.  BIP44 is genius.  To answer your question, no, it does not compromise the security as long as you use a strong seed phrase.
Regarding change addresses... each Bitcoin transaction makes you use ALL the money.  The money not specifically sent somewhere goes to the miner.  When you pay for a $15.65 dinner, provide a $20, and say "keep the change", you give $15.65 to the business owner and $4.35 as a tip to the server.  With Bitcoin, if you have 20BTC, send someone 15.65 BTC, and do nothing else the miner gets the extra 4.35BTC.
So using the 20BTC example, you'd tell the blockchain "send 15.65BTC to this person's address, I want 4.34BTC back in change at this address, and I leave 0.01BTC to the miner."  That's why every transaction completely wipes out the funds of the previous.
But why use a new address for your change?  Because you HAVE to send ALL the funds somewhere, you have a virtually unlimited supply of addresses, and it helps with privacy, so why not?  
A wallet is a complicated array of unspent transaction outputs.  The worst thing you could do is combine your funds into a single address or send back to a previous address.  If you have 20BTC in your wallet, that could actually be from 50 different addresses...but your wallet manages it and it all adds up to 20BTC.  When you send money, the wallet will figure out where to grab the money to get enough to pay.  It's just like you carrying around a bunch of $1s, $5s, $10s, $20s.  Instead of carrying around a $100, you mix and match the small denominations until you have enough, then you get change with a new bill.

* Credit card. Akin to 1-conf. You definitely got the money, but it could still be reversed. 
* Cash. Akin to any transaction. The $20 you got in change could have been used in the commission of a crime or it could be freshly printed and you're the first user.

Actually, it's much quicker.  This is a credit/debit transaction:
1. **Authorization** - You swipe the card, the merchant asks the processor who then asks the network (Visa, Mastercard, etc) who then asks the issuing bank if you have enough money.  If you do, it provides an authorization code; otherwise it's declined.  No money has changed hands.
2. **Batch processing** - At the end of the day, the merchant asks the processor to actually capture the funds.  This is where tips are added in, gas pump numbers are corrected, etc.  No money has changed hands.
3. **Clearing house** - The processor sends all the request for money into the network (Visa, MasterCard, etc) who then forwards the request to your issuing bank where the money is actually exchanged, minus fees.  This is the point at which your bank goes from "authorized charges" to "transaction".  Money has changed hands, but you still don't have it.
4. **Funding** - The processor deducts more fees and then deposits the funds into the merchant account.  Could be a day to a week.
This is Bitcoin:
1. **Broadcast** - You announce your transaction to the network, which spreads to every single bitcoin endpoint in a few seconds.  The standard client will "authorize it" by doing a quick sanity check to make sure you can spend what you say you want to spend and then it will accept your transaction.  Seeing your transaction echoed back from the network means everybody agrees you should be able to make that transaction.
2. **Confirmation** - The bitcoin network "balances the books" every 10 minutes or so, minus the fee.  When it sends out an updated ledger and your transaction is in it, that means everybody has agreed and the money has changed hands.
Regarding your card getting stolen, that's because you don't actually own the money on a credit card.  Bitcoin is like carrying cash.  You ARE liable for someone stealing your cash out of your pocket.  Perhaps in the future we'll have bitcoin-backed credit cards with fraud protection, but then that takes away from the decentralized nature of bitcoin.
