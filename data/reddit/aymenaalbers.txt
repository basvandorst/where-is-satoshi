I have sent around 4 emails now, I don't think either please or thank you is going to help much. And ignoring a customer's email because they didn't ask politely is beyond retarded.

Not to mention they are a registered business and have to abide by this little thing called the law. Them thinking they can get away with this is extremely naive.

The original reddit post is not deleted. If the link doesn't work for you you could search community alert in and you should find it.
Here is my original email, apologies for the poor wording, I was in a hurry.
I don't think Virwox has a phone number, and from experience, PayPal customer support is as helpful as a sack of shit.
