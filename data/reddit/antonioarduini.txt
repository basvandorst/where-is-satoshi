There is more debt than high liquidity money in the world. This keynesian madness from central banks are the cause of poverty, crises, inflation and wars. Cryptocurrencies will destroy the system, and change it from credit/debt to payment from real saved money.

Very  good, fuck the fiat currencies, stores  have to accept the cryptocurrencies directly, without any conversion.

This is SUPER important, let's all help to make this happen. It will have a strong psychological effect on people that today get scared by the price of one unit of bitcoin, others simply don't know that we can buy a fraction. The term uBTC is better than bits, but the BIP must be approved anyway.

Long term average volatility has always been decreasing. It decreases naturally with growth on market cap and commercial usage. When bitcoin market cap reaches tens of Trillions of dollars, the volatibility will be very low.

We need to start using uBTC or Satoshi as unit of account.

BCH can't scale to world currency without becoming centralized, because in order to get millions of transactions per second, it would need blocks of Terabytes. It would be a easy for governments to shut down this centralized shitcoin. An smart attack on bitcoin would be like this, influencing people to change the decentralized bitcoin (that is about to solve scalability problem with LN) to the centralized BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:15
LN doesnt cause any centralization, using the channels are optional and everybody will keep direct access to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:04:08
They can create their own hubs. Or they can simply avoid using LN and implement other technologies. Not a threat at all.

Everybody that is interested in cryptocurrencies and want decentralization should watch carefully this speech from Andreas Antonopoulos, on why the Bcash strategy of pure onchain scalability would end up with centralization.

Check Antonopoulos video on youtube called "Delivering Liberty, at scale", then you will understand.

Compared to Bitcoin, few people are using the centralized shitcoin Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:28:05
Not racism. But think who would have enough money and incentive to burn money to do expensive attacks of spam transactions agains Bitcoin network? I would say authoritarian governments and/or bankers. Mining is concentrated at China, China government is extremely authoritarian, they are suspects. The guys who are supporting BCH are the same who were supporting unlimited size blocks recently, they know this would lead to centralization.

Most capitalist way of helping poor, they get money and choose in a decentralized way how to fulfill their individual specific necessities, buying products and services on the private market, which is more efficient than government services because faces competition.

Spam transactions + empty blocks mined by groups who are burning huge amounts of money just to attack bitcoin. The only explanation is they are financially supported by governments or banks. They want huge blocks to centralize the network, but they will fail, new technologies like Lightning Network will keep bitcoin decentralized and make it scale with fast and cheap transactions.

Is there a possibility the BCC miners are slowing the BCC blocks just to artificially increase the price as no one can sell the shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:16:22
There is a third action of attack, waste huge amounts of money to make spam (fake) transactions on the other blocks which are not empty.

Patents should not exist, no one should respect them because they are artificial monopolies forced by the state over something that is not scarce, ideas. Rebuttal against the jusnaturalism argument is that no one should be the owner of an idea. Rebuttal against the utilitarian arguments is that patents actually slow down the progress of technology because it gives a monopoly to a company, so there is less competition.

Any user can choose to use the main chain if needed, the other chains are optional, for micro payments for example. They can even create their own chain.

Micropayments going to the second layers will make the main chain cheaper and faster to use for higher value transactions. Before increasing blocks a little bit we have to activate LN and Schnorr. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:48:14
The trolls at /btc keep saying LN is a danger because it would centralize the network, they are wrong, LN is not a danger because off-chain transactions will be optional, everyone will continue to have direct access to the main chain as before, in the case of any problem related to LN, is just not use it and the system continues as it was before and we can keep trying new solutions. In my opinion, LN will succeed, but if it doesn't it will cause no harm. So everyone should support LN.

Good because people will need to  learn how to do P2P transactions using tools like bitcoin OtC WoT. Exchanges are centralized services that passes all the information of people to government.

Governments are criminal gangs, and cryptocurrencies will disrupt them completely. The part of your wealth that is already in cryptocurrencies should never be converted to fiat currencies anymore. By doing it they can not do anything. Cryptos will continue to grow till the point they will dominate, during this period you can do 3 things: P2P trading between different cryptocurrencies(some of them will dominate). Holding. And buying goods and services directly in crypto, without any conversion to fiat, by P2P transactions using something like bitcoin OTC WOT.
