I’m sorry. Do you think everyone is an idiot? Opting to choose a different scaling approach does not make something a scam. Forks of the original projects are literally intended to redirect the original project down a different path. Do you think repeatedly calling something a scam is going to make it a reality? People actually have brains and can think for themselves.
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:20:15


You are blatantly lying.
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:16:18
It’s not a scam. It’s a fork that’s taking a different approach to scaling. One that matches the scaling description set forth in the white paper by the creator of the project. They’re also open to layer two to extend functionality and reduce tx load on chain. 
The only real difference I see between the two, is that the base layer is not crippled unnecessarily because of some unfounded fear that the centralization and subsequent demise of bitcoin will occur if the base layer remains cheap and functional. I think the most rational viewpoint on this matter is to do both. Scale on chain and off, safely. And that’s what that fork is planning to do. There’s no scam involved whatsoever.

First off down voting is not censorship. I know you guys love to change reality, but that doesn’t change reality. Secondly, the guy you’re responding to just got 17 down votes. So is he being censored here?

Hijacking the top comment since nobody thought to put the link to the actual tweet in this thread and it’s sitting at the very bottom. Hope folks will retweet and like it on Twitter for exposure:

So a useless pretend electronic rock that you can’t even make jewelry with? 
No. It’s a currency. 
And if we’re talking about what’s easier to say, one word is easier than two.

That may be true. But what do you thinks going to happen when bitcoin can’t be used once again? It already happened. All the merchant adoption we had been building for six years was completely destroyed in January 2018. Because of fees and taking nearly a week to send funds. 
What do you thinks going to happen when that occurs again in the next 12 months? Do you think everyone’s just going to throw their hands up and say “Oh well that’s bitcoin for ya! ��“
No. That’s not what’s going to happen. The money is going to flow somewhere else.

That’s what happens when you tell the guy creating ETH to kick rocks and go build his own altcoin instead of building it on bitcoin as a second layer side chain like he wanted to. 
Remember guys? This was your decision.  Rather than innovate and grow, and expand after 10 freaking years, you wanted to lock down, minimize, and cripple.
Imagine where BTC would be today if the entire crypto ecosystem was running as a side chain on top of it. Wed probably already be at $100,000 per BTC today.  
I hope everyone realizes the insane opportunity cost that’s been inflicted on the bitcoin ecosystem.

What’s it like being the personification of a douchebag? 
Practically every sentence you just wrote sounds like something the biggest douche I’ve ever known would write. 
Not trying to be mean, but I can’t believe people like you even exist and think the way you think. It’s so cringe.
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:01:48
No.  But plenty of baseless theories abound. Like BCH running out of money. �� or Roger finally realizing BTC is the way, the truth, and the life.  Who needs facts when you’re in a place where unapproved thinking is punishable?

Hands down.  
It confuses me why Pomp is the figurehead these days.  Andreas [can inspire heads of state]( give you goosebumps, and can silence even the most critical detractor.  
He is the fucking king of oration in all things crypto and I wish we could clone a hundred of him to help change the world.
please post this on r/cryptocurrency so the retarded lambo teens are exposed to this guy.
@_date: 2019-08-27 01:32:43


I am no CSW supporter but you people need to stop with this retarded ass logic. 
Just because somebody hasn’t done something, doesn’t mean you have proof that they’re lying about anything. 
I’ve heard incredibly smart people use this logical fallacy over and over, and it astounds me. Just because somebody hasn’t done something you expect them to do, doesn’t mean you have proof that they’re lying. Period. 
The most you can claim is that you don’t know because they haven’t proven anything.

Oh did Designer really “call it” ?   You mean he completely pulled something out of his rear end? 
Do you guys just like to make things up and then hope that the dumb people here don’t actually check your information? 
Go look at Rogers Instagram account. Two days ago he was speaking at a conference about bitcoin cash in front of a huge group of people in Asia. 
I mean just make stuff up. Why why would truth even matter to any of you right?  Low class, immoral ****s.

What facts do you have to base this on?  
Or did you just completely make this up so that people think the way you want them to think about these situations,

You are talking about Stocks. Stocks are NOT categorized as personal property by the IRS so the rules referenced have no implication towards crypto.  
Cryptocurrency is categorized as personal property. As such, as per the laws of Puerto Rico, personal property acquired prior to moving to Puerto Rico is still taxed at 0% capital gains. 
This is no different than selling a painting that you purchased before moving to Puerto Rico.
This misinformation saying otherwise needs to stop flying around. 
There are ultra conservative tax attorneys who are spreading it, but it’s false. The law is very clear. Pre- Puerto Rico crypto investments are included. 
The majority of people that arrive in Puerto Rico domesticate their assets by selling and re-buying or simply trading them in and out throughout their first year.
While it is considered an aggressive position to take, it is 100% backed by the stated laws.
If you disagree, please feel free to contact the  crypto tax attorney in PR who was featured in The NY Times article on this very topic, Giovanni Mendez.
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:06:42
Yes.  You can cash out 0% capital gains.  Ignore every single person in this thread because they don’t know what they’re talking about. 
It fascinates me how many people talk when they are completely guessing.  
We are here in PR and all of us are taking advantage of this tax program.  As long as crypto remains categorized by the IRS as personal property, it does not matter where you were a resident when you first obtained it.  
183 days, meeting the closer connections rules, and solidifying residency, and you’re golden.   Or you can do only 90 days in PR if you spend only 90 days on the mainland and travel internationally the rest of the year.

Legacy finance proponent apparently right?  You guys all seem to think that inflation is necessary for something to be a currency. 
The LOL required for that kind of twisted thinking…
Deflation encourages spending. 
Surprise. 
Everything you think you know, is wrong.
If somebody has $100 today and has $150 tomorrow, what do you think they’re going to do with it? Save it? Or go buy something with it?
When people get bonuses from work, do they put it under the mattress? 
Or do they pay off bills. Buy a new car.
When somebody gets a salary increase, do they take all that extra money and do nothing with it? 
Or do they get a nicer apartment because they can afford higher rent?
A currency that increases in value, encourages spending. Period.
If I have $100 today, and $150 tomorrow, I’m gonna go spend $50, because I know I’ll have $150 once again, later.

What I don’t understand is how they declared themselves anything. If you go out on a boat and declare yourself a sovereign nation, I’m pretty sure nobody’s going to care. Let alone threaten to give you the electric chair.

If the trend results in reduced mining difficulty and new parties hopping in to mine, then Bitcoin is stronger from it :)

You’ve got to be kidding me with this comment. 
The key holders to the Bitcoin protocol repository (and therefore dev team) were literally on staff with a centralized for-profit company that has investors in banking and other powerful places. You have no problem with that, but you’re going to attack the most well known bitcoin merchant processing company in the world with over 100,000 merchants on boarded and has been doing it for eight years?
I have no problem with a centralized company providing services external to the bitcoin protocol. This is not against what bitcoin is about in the slightest. It’s quite literally how everything is going to play out.  You should have a problem with the protocol itself being under the influence of a single entity that has investors which play a role in the direction of the protocol code.

New? They’ve been working on it for FOUR YEARS.
Which would be fine if you hadn’t crippled the base layer in the meantime.   ��
