In New Hampshire we have bitcoin meetups.  
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:00:03
Without a bitcoin day I believe the transaction will be low priority.  It probably will confirm, it just might take a while.  I think if the transaction is over 1kB in size it might never confirm without a fee.

I took the liberty to rebroadcast your transaction.  That might help.  The network is stressed right now.  
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:40:16
Yes.  After fork send bitcoins to another address you have the private key for.  Use that private key to spend the bitcoins on each branch using the correct client. 
If you don't send them to a post fork address that you own.  I believe you'll run the risk of spending your bitcoins on both branches in one transaction.  
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:01:31
It's called use.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:07:32
How is the network not governed already.  Install the client with the code you want to run.  You might have to change your software if it becomes incomparable with the network.  What else is needed?  
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:42:00
I bitcoin address is a base 58 number.  The raw data being encoded is 160 bits.  So There are log_(58)(2^160) or 160*log_(58)(2) charters in a bicoin address (ignoring the initial 1).  Some bitcoin address have fewer charters as the first digit or two is zero.  
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:24:58

@_date: 2015-06-02 05:01:03
For free?  If you start with x bitcoins you will need to wait 1/x days until you have a bitcoin day.  After that time you should be able to send up to 4 transactions.  
So, if you started  with 145 bitcoins you could send out 4 transactions of .0001 to four different addresses without any fee every 10 minutes.  You would not be guaranteed to be included in the next block, but in theory you could get in the next block.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:40:47
The fee is .0001 and it seems that there is less than a bitcoin day being spent.  The transaction will become higher priority as it accumulates confirmations of the inputs.  
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:46:11
A few addresses I looked at have 32 or 33 charters.  That's probably because of the checksum property mentioned below.

Go to the transaction on blockchain.info
change tx to rawtx and put ?format=hex at the end.  
What you see at this link is a *BIG* hexadecimal number.  
Copy this number, then go to 
and paste and press submit.  This often gives me an error but the transaction then shows up in the network later.  
You can also try to push the transaction through blockchain.info, but since they already know about the transaction they may not rebroadcast it.

The issue is that you need to alert the network of your block if you find one.  From the moon this will take 2 seconds or more.  If a block is found on earth in those two seconds it is likely that your block will be orphaned.  If a block is not found on earth in these two seconds, then your mining should be working fine.  I'm assuming that you don't use a pool on Earth.

According to bitcoin wisdom the network is around 252,000,000 Ghash which is 252,000,000,000 Mhash so you have 2/252,000,000,000 of the network now each year there are 144*365*25 bitcoins mined this is 1314000 so your miner theoretically would have claim on 2/252,000,000,000 * 1314000 of them or about 1049 satoshi.  currently worth about 4 tenths of a cent.

I'm not sure if I understand your question, but look at any block.
The first transaction has the reward + fees for that block.
If you "resolve" any block then it won't be considered valid unless you solve every block after that one, and then one more.  This is a monumentally difficult task especially considering that the rest of the net work will be building blocks on top of the chain your trying to beat.

Think of all the unknowns.  The block size limit will be gone or higher.  There probably will be a ton of transactions in every block.  The price will probably be higher.  Everyone will be using 14nm ASICs or better (what better would be I don't know).  There probably won't be a state or legacy banking system around to want to attack bitcoin.  To say that you can predict that far out is really a stretch.

If you look at google adsense terms of service.  You are not allowed to pay to click or encourage clicks.  A faucet does not do this.  The ToS explicitly state that if the site gives something away that's fine, just don't pay to click and the person who is being paid is not allowed to click ever.  Language such as "clicking the adds will support this site," is also prohibited by the terms.  Other advertisers don't have this restriction, but if you use google adsense I wouldn't put that type of language on the page anywhere.

@_date: 2014-05-31 14:07:14
There is an option of paying two (or ten) people with one transaction.  If you know what you're going to spend at each location before you spend it then this will be a solution.  
@_date: 2014-09-02 11:20:46
The short answer:  The market.
This means that some people say they want to buy.  Lots of people will want to buy cheaply.  But fewer people want to pay more.  The opposite goes for selling, many want to sell at a high price, fewer at a lower.  As soon as someone wants to buy at a price equal of greater than the cheapest seller then they make the trade.  The last price of one of these trades is considered to be the "price of bitcoin."  
Almost all markets work like this.

What will happen to existing BTC.  
Most likely there will be only one branch of the fork that gets mined.  This means that you'll spend your bitcoins like normal for Electrum, and you'll need to update you bitcoin-qt to spend the bitcoins twice.  
**Unlikely:** It's not likely that both branches of a fork would survive but in that case your bitcoins would be alive on both branches.  You could send the bitcoins to one of your addresses after such a fork, and then you could spend those bitcoins once on each chain.

The miners could include more transactions in a block so this could increase the fees that miners receive.  
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:50:17
Then the fees will be more than the miniscule reward.  Already there are a good number of blocks with fees equal to 1% (0.25 BTC) of the reward. They just did a test with 20MB blocks.  With the bigger blocks maybe 10% fee to reward (2.5 BTC) would not be out of the question.

People are in favor of raising the block size limit because the block size limit should be able to accommodate peak use.  Just because bitcoin can handle all of the transactions it's served now.  That doesn't mean that it should not be able to handle more transactions later.

Some people are mad because the last three years of bitcoin management have led to this great disparity.  It may be true that you have more money now.  However, the influx of new cash now that BCC (or BCH) is just a hint as to the amount of money that was being withheld until the core developers got their shit together.  Currently, it seems the core developers will never have their shit together.  Crappy product is crappy.  Bitcoin had so much more potential!

Good news everyone!!
You're golden.  Just restore from the backup.  Put those 144 letters on the paper wallet in and you will have restored a wallet with the private keys.  
Now you might need to generate new keys.  If you don't see your full balance you might need to click receive bitcoins, and have new addresses created.  This is if you used more than one address to receive in what is now your watching wallet.

My initial post was intended to point out a [Reductio_ad_absurdum]( argument to the original post.  
For example, one time someone proposed that the Kansas school system should teach all creation theories including the theory that the universe was created by a flying spaghetti monster.  This method of argumentation exposes the claim "teach all creation theories" as absurd. 
Basically, you're talking about the flying spaghetti monster, while I'm challenging the claim about "teach all theories."
My only claim is that not doing something because someone will beat you is a silly course of action.  To argue that you shouldn't do something because someone could attack you, on it's face, that is a silly argument because it could be applied to anything.  I made a comment about the car.  If you really think that 
"You shouldn't drive a car because someone can beat you and take it from you."
then you are absurd.

Demand and Supply.  If someone is willing to pay $100 and someone is willing to sell at $100 then they trade and the price is $100.  If someone is willing to buy at $100 and no one is willing to sell at that price then maybe someone else says I'll buy for $110 and if someone is willing to sell at that price then the price is $110.  If not, then someone may come along and say I'll pay $120  ... etc. etc. etc.

Maybe I'm paranoid.  If you have email set up with blockchain.info  and you import the key, then an email is sent with that private key.  Even if you wipe the key from blockchain.info the file still exists.  It will be encrypted so the risk of compromise is very slim.  Best practice is to only use a key pair once.  This means that you just have the change go to an address you control.  Blockchain.info can do this with the custom feature.

There was a branch that 0.7 couldn't process.  The decision was to go back to the 0.7 branch instead of the 0.8 branch.  Today 0.7 is not supported so if your 0.7 client goes on the wrong branch it's your fault, and you would probably know because the client would stall.

@_date: 2013-11-19 20:16:35
You can send up to four (five?) at a time.  Each extra input increases the size (in kB) of the transaction.  The greater the size (in kB) the less likely the transaction will confirm.  
Why I said your method won't work 
1) the First step A -&gt; B is not needed if you send one bitcoin from A to B which already had .00000001(whatever) you don't end up with one address with a ballance of 1.00000001(whatever).  What you end up with is one address with a 1 output and a .000000001 output.  You would need to spend both these outputs to merge them, so why don't just do that in the first step.  Your method would have produced one adderss (Address C) with two outputs of 1.00000001 and .00000001.  You still have one dust transaction.

The way it worked last time I checked, and it's updated all the time.
If there was an ouput less than .01 then a fee of at least .0001 is required.  If the fee is not included the transaction may still confirm.  
If there is no output less than .01, and the transaction is less than 1kB.  then the thansaction is low priority if sum(confirmations[of input] * input [in bitcoins]) is less that 144 if this sum is bigger than 144 then the transaction is not low prioity.  Transactions that are not low prioity have 50kB of space reserved for them in any block.  Transactions are included in that 50kB based on how large that sum is (which increases evey block that's found).  
Edit:  This is not exact, I know.  It should get the idea across.

Most mining now is done with ASIC(Aplication Specific Integrated Circuts) chips.  If mining ever becomes unprofitable some miners will drop out and the difficulty will go down and then mining will be more profitable.  
Transaction fees also go to minors.  Currently a block could contain half a bitcoin in transaction fees.

Now I understand your question.  The pool gives away money in order to persuade people to mine for them.  Well I doubt ASCI miner would be on board with that pool so that's 25% of the network that won't go along.  Also BTC-guild would only have to convince a third of the remaining hashing power to use their pool.  
If your hypothetical pool did pull it off though they would be very successful at loosing money.  And a 51% attack wouldn't really give  them a chance to swindle all of it back.

Bitcoin is still at the early stages.  Computer security is important.  This is like cash for the internet.  If you leave cash accessible to someone then it can be taken and there's not much that can be done about it.  
OK.  Now, a wallet in this context refers to a file.  The file will have one or more private keys in it.  Each private key will have an address associated to it.  Anyone can send bitcoins to any of your addresses.  When bitcoins get sent to your address you will need the corresponding private key, in the wallet, to spend the bitcoins.  
What I did to set up a wallet for my friend.  I went to  and clicked wallet at the top right.  I put in my friend's email and made up a password and put it in twice there is also a captia.  There were a list of words I wrote down and am storing in a safe place.  This is in case my friend looses access to the wallet I'll give him these words to recover the wallet.  I also wrote down the identifier on a separate sheet of paper.  Once I logged in I saw an address in the new wallet I then sent bitcoins to this address.  I iinformed my friend that there were some strange emails in their inbox and I would explain them latter.
I then met my friend in person had them click a link in their email and told them the password.

Put the watch only wallet on any computer.  There is no security breach.  (Maybe an information leak, but the bitcoins are safe)
If you completely format your offline computer you will not be able to spend any bitcoins in the armory wallet without restoring from a backup.  I would recommend having two ways to access the bitcoins.  If you don't have the wallet on the offline computer then the paper backup becomes the only access point.  In which case it's no longer a backup.

Now when you spend again it may not draw from the same coins that were sent.  This would not lead to a sucessful double spend.

Small transactions without many (days) confirmations require a fee of .0001.  That's why your balance went down .0001 btc.  Next you transfered the .0048 (.0047 with the fee) to the watch only address.  Blockchain does not have the private key so that's why you can't spend it.  
I would suspect if you imported the private key from the paper wallet you could send .0046 after a fee to any address you like.  
You blockchain wallet must count your watch only balance toward the total balance.

I admit that there is merit in what you describe, but there are other factors.  What if you want to add a transaction to the block?  In that case you would need to start over checking the space.  
There are other issues such as what if a miner drops out, what if an unknown miner adds in.  What if the temperature is 10 degrees cooler one day causing the miner to get an extra 200 Mhash/sec.

Elliptic curve cryptography uses elliptic curves defined over finite fields.  
Now the paper you quote talks about the ECDLP in characteristic two.  This means that in the finite fields of the paper 1+1 = 0.  
The characteristic that bitcoin uses is 2^256 -2^32 -2^9 -2^8 -2^7 -2^6 -2^4 -1
The short version is that this prime number is not equal to two.

The probability that a block comes out in the next minute is an almost fixed amount.  This means that sometimes there will be an unlucky streak and no blocks will come out for a while.  This is just the probabilistic nature of this process.  
If you want to know the math behind it look up the Possion distribution.  
There has now been a block which included the most pressing transactions and the next one should clean up the other standard transactions.

Yes, but awesome.  Both sides probably have the lawyers to back up the contract.

When I use the Web version, (not phone).  There is an option to make a custom transaction.  I then copy the payment address and the change address.  There is a plus sign to add another field for payment.  I make sure that the payment address and amount is right then in the other field for payment I put my change address and calculate to the exact satoshi the change.  input - Payment - fee
I then hit send and look at all of the details before releasing the transaction into the wild.  I always make sure that there is not a third output.

The method of attack.  What direction are they attacking from.  
Malware that looks for a wallet.dat file would only effect bitcoin-qt users.

This wont work.  
 
Use coin control to move adderss A and address B into Adress Z with one output of 1.00000001.  Wait at least one day and move the input at address Z and address C to a Address Y with a ballance of 1.00000002  
Waiting at least a day is necessary.  You need at least one bitcoin day for this to work.

Thank you for your research.  Cbeast on the first link is confused about what could be done to implement a brain wallet.  The second link is about HD wallets, not brain wallets.  
The next two links do suggest that other implementations are obvious and easy.  I would assume it reasonable that someone has done it, even if it's not available for any ordinary Joe.  
So uncle.

It's been good to me.  There is a price that it won't be worth buying at though.  I wouldn't recommend buying at any price.  
Buy a little bit and learn about markets.  Don't cash out.  Buy something if it gets to be a lot of money.  If it goes to zero consider it a lesson.  There's plenty of time for you to make money.

.0001 per 5 (inputs + outputs)  round up to the nearist .0001.
4 input + 3 outputs = 7 total pay .0002

once you use a private key on block chain.info then the security of that key is not as secure as your tails wallet.  I am interested in this question, but do not know a better answer.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:48:06
What service or good do they offer?
@_date: 2013-07-26 15:53:26
Your comment encouraged me to look up Wei Dai's web site.  Good stuff.  You might like it as well so I'll share.

Other clients use different wallet formats.  So I don't think so.  Blockchain.info has an import wallet app which will accept a wallet.dat.  I wouldn't use blockchain.info for large amounts.  In a pinch it might be a good idea.  Don't keep large amounts at blockchain.info
With your pending transaction.  It's from you to you yes?  It either confirms or it doesn't.  If it confirms then you'll have a ballance in Mtgox.  No problem.  If it doesn't confirm you'll eventually have it restored to your local wallet.  It might be best to wait.  
There is a way to import your old wallet into a new client.  However I recomend just making a transaction from the old to the new.

Still quicker than an ACH.
