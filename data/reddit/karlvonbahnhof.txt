Mycelium is better than Bitpay. I tried Bitpay at first because they already had plugins so I thought it would be less work but I didn't make it work anyway. Mycelium can be handled more easily if you are/have a dev.  
Edit: and indeed, Mycelium only needs your email address.

They probably run some automated detection system. These get false positives very often. I am constantly having similar problem with ipv4 addresses. As virtual servers and cloud droplets get reused, pretty much whenever you buy one its ip is already listed in at least some spam blacklist because someone else had that ip before you and abused it.

Out of the loop, what's the thing with Andreas now? He got the donation now this December and sold the coins again?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:35:34
Right. I'll just say one thing: I am glad I have never been to a btc meet up and never spoke to a bitcoiner in person because apparently the most dangerous to a btc holder are not the bankers, not the govts, not the IRS - it's the bitcoiners who sold early, especially the self righteous "saints" and evangelists.

Dude, money is your lifeline. That must be totally obvious to anyone who at some point was left with really nothing plus no safety network like family or social state. If you *dedicate* really **everything to a cause** you are relying on the crowd to bail you out of your unwise decision, basically. How's that worth celebrating.

Maybe the norm will just change. I mean, I know a story like this too - couple now in their 60s living in a nice big country house paid for from basically odd jobs, having raised two kids with no cash shortage ever. (On one occasion she said she probably didn't even earn 30k USD in total over all her life, she's retired now.) That is I believe not possible these days and not going to be possible anymore. But then these days people living from salaries in Europe don't buy homes, ever, and it's completely normal to live and have kids and retire in a leased flat. Not even a house. Most people live in residential flats with thin walls so that you hear everything from the neighbors, it's pretty much like living in school dorms (uncomfortable) but it is really normal, nobody thinks about it. It's unbelievable but people actually had kids even during great wars, you know? So I think the social disparity will just increase with generations but in no way are people going to stop breeding kids...

Your view is too crude IMO. That's like saying "bible says 'everything is meaningless' so we should ditch all things". people are more important than things, and things are not unimportant, just not permanent. 
money is much less a guarantee of a good life or safety than your manager at work wants you to believe, so it should be handled accordingly - but that's about it.

Same for herbal stuff though - herbs that are "brain food" and don't really do much, or some natural cosmetic products...it's not that it's addictive or dangerous but EU and US have ridiculous import regulations on things that get used normally in Asia and South America.
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:24:24
South America is not the best place in terms of infrastructure but if it somehow happens to work out then this is maybe bigger news than it looks like.

This. IMO adding BTC as an eshop payment option and even buying/selling on LBC is also doing more than speculation.

I never really understood the situation of people from 3rd world...tried to verify in a couple of crypto places with my 3rd world ID instead of with my 1st world ID. I got "sorry we do not verify IDs from your country" AND my accounts got blocked so I cannot reverify with the 1st world ID. There cannot be much of a new retail, ever probably, if this is how it's going to be.
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:44:32
It's actually a more complex problem for me because I don't bank in the country of my 3rd world ID so I need to verify in the mainstream services as I bank in the 1st world. I'm hoping the 3rd world countries get decent service and liquidity though.
@_date: 2018-11-05 06:05:37
The notion of "delinquency" was invented by the rich in 18th century and solidified in society because it made the bottom line of the players with most power easier to reach (checking the society for criminal activity effectively means monitoring everyone). The opposition against the creation of the "delinquent" were the poor who (those days) stole because they wanted to survive.

Well, since LBC shows real names and coincidence happens, I know for a fact there is at least one person who's never been in this sub and buys on LBC, unrelated to speculation. But I guess you know better.

That would need a character like A. Antonopulos to be common in crypto. But the current crop of bitcoiners love their drama.

He's good, I'm subscribing to his YT channel. I was just thinking how aligned with the 'identity' problem it is that I respect his views on crypto while I know literally nothing about who he is.

That reminds me of the stripe about FE development where the developer delivers a nice and usable design and the client says "it's fine but I had something more like this in my mind" - a site full of flashy late 90s gifs and crap like that. It sucks when the FE dev is only seen as the coder with no room for judgement. Devs literally need to convince the clients why their ideas will work better and sometimes that's not possible. But for crypto wallets I think that was a legit segment, probably saturated now, for a dead simple smartphone wallet where someone could hold 50 USD of coin without knowing what crypto really is.
