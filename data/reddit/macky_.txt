Could the exchange understate their liability but creating a fictitious user with a large negative balance? Edit: I see gengen_ asked the same question and nullc answered it.

I disagree, Microbit is ambiguous as a bit is not currently defined. *Microbitcoin* is not. Bit is not a recognised abbreviation for Bitcoin.

If that was the case, i would have expected their account to have been suspended already. Surely their bank would have noticed the unusual nature of the transactions by now? In any event, their customers would probably be well advised to take steps to minimise their exposure to a worse case scenario.

If you generate the buyers multsignature key, what prevents you from keeping a copy of that key? If your customers need to trust that you don't keep a copy, then you may as well just trust you with their bitcoins as the multisig is just a facade. Am I misunderstanding how this works?

I'm not sure a 1 minute confirmation time solves this problem; if the miners are unlucky, it could take up to 3 minutes to solve a Doge block. I sure as hell wont be waiting at the counter for 3 minutes. 
In the end, the retailer needs to weigh up the risk of the double spend (which is far far far less than 3%), I believe CoinBase and the various brokers will absorb the risk anyway.

Assuming this document is not a fake and MtGox is wound up:
**Using $160 per goxBTC (as used in the document)**
* Assets: $32.4m Cash + $0.3m of BTC = $32.7m
* Liabilities: $55.0m  + $119.1m of BTC= $174.1m
* Asset/Liability ratio: $32.3m/$174.1m = **18.5c in the dollar**
**Using a market rate of $500 per BTC**
* Assets: $32.4m Cash + $1.0m of BTC = $33.4m
* Liabilities: $55.0m  + $372.2m of BTC= $427.2m
* Asset/Liability ratio: $32.4m/$427.2m = **7.7c in the dollar**
Please check my maths. Discuss? Interesting to note that Bitcoin builder is trading at 16c in the dollar at the time of writing.

We really need p2pool mining to take off. 
I'm sick of the argument that GHash and BTCGuild have no incentive to perpetrate a 51% attack. The attack would come from a hacker that gained access to both pools, not the pool owners themselves! Do I trust BTCGuild and GHash's security? *Absolutely not.* 
What would a hacker have to gain from a 51% attack? Plenty. If that hacker shorted Bitcoin they could make a absolute killing by orchestrating a 51% attack.

Bitcoin is hardly Zero sum. It has the potential to reduce transaction friction, increasing trade efficiency. 
Yes, there will be winners and losers, as with any change. However, net-net, Bitcoin is likely to have a positive impact for the economy as a whole. Who knows, if cryptocurrencies stimulate the global economy enough, perhaps traditional banks will do more non-transaction related trade and perhaps benefit.
I do agree with you that the first bank to open the doors to Bitcoin will likely do very well, paving the way for others to enter the space or lose relevance :-)

Because its likely they've known they had a shortfall for quite some time and covered it up hoping that they would one day be able to trade their way out of it. It's not inconceivable that rather than raising equity, they sold some of the BTC on deposit to bankroll their operation with the expectation they could pay it back in future. It's also possible that they were a victim of a hack and chose not to disclose it to prevent a run.
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:16:33
Let me translate this: 
We are insolvent and have been franticly trying to sell a stake in Mt.Gox to an investor for the last 3 months (white knight) to cover the shortfall. The wheels are now falling off the bus so until we raise some money, withdrawals have been suspended. If we do not raise any money, you will not see any of your cash. Thank you for supporting us over the years.

Wow, thanks for the detailed response. Ideally there should be little need for trust in a bitcoin world, if possible, I think you should consider adding the ability for advanced users to supply their own public key. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:01:29
Why the need for them to be anonymous? Any competent law enforcement agency would be able to identify them by tracking their fiat transfers. I'm sure, when pressure is applied, btc-e's banks will give up their details. So if they are not anonymous to law enforcement, I cannot think of a single good reason why they should be anonymous to their customers.

Courtesy of Anandtech: 
Sid Meier’s Civilization has been one of the most successful and popular strategy games since it first started back in the early 90s. But Sid Meier has lent his name (and presumably his talents) to some other titles as well. You can grab the current bundle for any donation of $1 or more, and that will get you five titles: Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete (~90%, September 2004), Sid Meier’s Civilization IV: The Complete Edition (~91%, May 2009), Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol (71%, August 2013), Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies (59%, November 2013), and Sid Meier’s Railroads! (77%, October 2006). The first two in the list include several DLC/expansion packs along with the core game, and if you haven’t ever played Civ3 or Civ4, prepare to lose a few weeks of your life if you’re not careful. Paying more than the average (currently $8.62 and rising) will you get two more Civilization games: Sid Meier’s Civilization V (90%, September 2010) and Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Gods and Kings DLC (80%, June 2012). As the latest additions to the Civilization franchise, beating the average to get Civ5 is definitely recommended. And finally, as an added twist there’s an eighth title available, if you pay more than $15: Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World (85%, June 2013). Purchased separately on Steam right now, the eight titles would carry a combined price tag of nearly $145, so even if you “splurge” for the $15 pack you’re getting an awesome 90% off deal.

Was the 80k worth of suspicious user coins included in the 750k? I can't recall. If not, the total customer liabiliy may have been 750k+80k=830k . Add in gox's 100k coins and you get to 930k - pretty close to the 950k the DB is reporting.

I suspect internal theft too. There was a massive cover up, there is no way they didn't know about the shortfall. *Nobody* is that incompetent. What surprises me that they continued to trade and accept deposits even in the last few days when the game was up. In my country, it is illegal to trade while insolvent - I assume its the same in Japan. If so, Karpeles might be in more than a little legal trouble.
