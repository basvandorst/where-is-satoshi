The good thing about banks in this regard is there's legal clout to get money moved. That doesn't translate to crypto right now.

If you try to hide from the IRS you’re going to lose

More like it needs to be impossible to accidentally send your life savings to a scammer or just the wrong person with no chance of recovery

I think coin base cap is weekly?

I don’t think people maxing credit cards buying crypto currency are the lesson learning type

Drawing a 520k a year salary wouldn’t be so bad =p

The s&amp;p is one stock market, and its market cap is drastically higher than 200B. That’s my point
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:49:43
That’s literally a 1% swing in the s&amp;p. That’s nothing

You pay taxes on it either way.

Hot, electricity guzzling Chinese warehouses == humanity's first true money?
How about just gold? Food?

There are already a few large companies trusting coinbase. And no, they absolutely would not want to manage bitcoin systems internally, that's nuts. Large tech companies process transactions through third parties in general (Stripe, Paypal, Braintree...)
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:37:24


Currently businesses do this through a third party that immediately converts BTC -&gt; USD (e.g. coinbase). They would never store/manage btc directly

And suddenly your trustless system isn't trustless ;)

Then you'll pay long term capital gains.
If it's any money at all, just hire an accountant. Fines for getting it wrong aren't worth it
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:19
Capital gains is just income tax if you hold for &lt; a year

They sure are the best system we've got for it so far. Government is, for all of history so far, a major pillar of human society.

NASA has a 19 billion dollar budget. They had the money to do it, just not the vision and the dedication.

Roll in base 6 and convert later.

Because they are correlated in absolutely no way imaginable.

No matter the value of each, 1 bitcoins vs 1 Apple share is a meaningless comparison my dude
