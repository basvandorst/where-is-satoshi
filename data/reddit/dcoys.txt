This is a new feature. They didn't always have this functionality.

Darn. I thought because they didn't comply with the General attorney they would allow. Sorry

Wouldn't kraken be the best option for NY?

Good luck!

I think they were created to test other theories people had about creating a blockchain. Bitcoin has learned from these altcoins as well.

+1 for someone receiving the payout!

I really wish they would stop the memes...

You are looking for a "decentralized" app, but you will "trust" people on Reddit to tell you which one is best. Hopefully you do some research after they have given you direction. :)

It would be awesome to make this into an interactive infographic with links and colors (ie stages of implementation from research &gt; proposal &gt; implementation &gt; deployed) .
Great work!

I want to believe what you are preaching but that isn't always how history turns out.  Words get in the dictionary because of extensive use (normally colloquialisms). An example would be "hottie". You may describe them and split them, but not the masses.

My guess (based on his response) is: it's a balance between marketing for sales and education. Bitcoins sounds like the plural version of Bitcoin. "I have multiple Bitcoins in my wallet".

I don't disagree with you, but I think it's challenging to solve. In your examples you mentioned a few different technologies, I tried to simplify things.  
"Normal wallets" (you didn't mention, but infer based on eclair) - the standard bank. One where you don't move money often. 
Eclair - a different type of bank with faster and cheaper costs, but harder to use. I recently tried "Breez" and it seems like a step in the right direction for lightning. They mostly open the first channel for you (don't know if it's scalable though)
Btcpayserver - an invoicing system for someone running a business or wants really good accounting. Works on both normal wallets and eclair. 
The challenge is: a normal person won't understand all of these things because it doesn't always map to traditional banking and they probably don't even understand traditional banking (ie hidden fees, credit cards, loan and collateral, etc). 
An educational learning environment would be great, but there is a lot of use cases to solve for.
