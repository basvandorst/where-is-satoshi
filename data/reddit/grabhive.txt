Hey guys!
We've been quietly working on a lot of nice stuff for you this last month. Pleased to announce we'll be going 1.0 at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami at the end of January!
As usual, you can follow our progress here:
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:27:44
That doesn't really seem appropriate for Burning Man, but if someone wants to make it a VERY SPECIAL "ticker", then maybe.
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:49:00
Working on it. Apple's byzantine bureaucracy is what it is...
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:47:12
Not yet.
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:44:44
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:52:37
Nicolas from Blockchain tells us otherwise.
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:03:57
Hive gents here. Two of us will be representin'.
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:38:37
Black Rock City only for now, but let's see how it plays out over the next few months!
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:55:08
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:07:42
I would agree if we were advertising anything other than the thing that we love.
Anyway, there will be no strung-up company banners or any other such nonsense. We will have some educational utility and there will likely be a stage where talks will be given about various futurist and monetary subjects. (Speakers welcome).
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:11:51
This is a fantastic talk.
@_date: 2013-10-08 06:25:37
Jason, what is the non-Coinbase Bitcoin address for Sean's Outpost?
@_date: 2013-10-15 13:00:45
Right now we have English and Polish covered, but we would love to support a wide variety of the world's languages. If China is truly on its way (which it sounds like), we'd love to see the languages of that region, especially! Please do feel free to email us at w if you'd like to help!
Thanks everyone!
@_date: 2013-10-15 21:42:01
Very much so.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:01:52
Hope so! Would you like to help us build one?
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:42:47
There is more than one way to run a service like this, and not all of them include actually holding a wallet.
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:14:09
Hell yeah!
@_date: 2013-11-01 22:33:56
It is rather strange how the public story tends to set aside the fact they have their own currency. Initially that seemed to be a measure to prevent fire-and-pitchfork-wielding among the Bitcoin faithful, but now perhaps it's more about keeping calm in the increasingly bubbling regulatory waters.
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:41:40
I'm afraid that we're caught in a bit of wordplay here.
Mariusz does not mean "emotion before function" where it pertains to the quality and security of the wallet itself, although admittedly the current version is more an example of where we are headed in an "emotional" sense, hence all the warnings.
If you feel like it, we would really appreciate a mockup of your ideas posted to the bitcointalk thread. We are certainly not dismissing anything outright at this early stage, and I think actually being able to _see_ your ideas more clearly would be helpful to further the discussion.
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:56:16
Thanks for the GitHub issue report. ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-16 09:38:02
Exactly. This is an attempt to frame the debate as though you can only have one, but of course cash is already both anonymous **and** mainstream.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:28:41
It's a pure Objective C native app wrapping bitcoinj (java). So it wouldn't really be a "port", but rather more of a from-scratch write with the exception of the bitcoinj part.
@_date: 2013-09-29 06:24:20
Regarding what involves a fee, I mean _specifically_ apps within our app platform. Going to something like bitcoinstore.com in your browser would not involve fees, nor would any person-to-person transfer.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:36:43
Sorry about that. :( It was a hard decision to make, really.
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:43:27
Yeah, if the fees become a burden for people, we certainly won't be opposed to lowering them. It may not even prove to be the appropriate revenue stream for a wallet in the long run, but it's an idea that we want to try. Duly noted about "smallest possible transaction fee" though. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:09:49
Nice one. :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 11:06:55
Hi guys! It's been a busy week over here in the Hive camp, but we're finally able to open the door to third party developers. Any questions/comments/concerns, please direct them here, on the bitcointalk forum or privately to w 
We're really looking forward to see what happens with this!
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:52:46
Just a reminder about our time traveler from the future...
@_date: 2013-10-17 19:16:50
You're both right.
@_date: 2013-10-18 14:47:52
We spoke with Chan from Bitmit today. They're in the process of a migration to some new code. Probably nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:24:57
Nice job, keep working on it!
@_date: 2013-10-08 11:16:04
We should have that solved with BitcoinKit soon (embedded VM).
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:10:45
Indeed, please get it done so others can follow your lead.
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:22:28
It's not mean at all, thanks for the feedback. Can you tell me more about the toolbar idea? Would you have applications and everything in there?
@_date: 2013-10-15 11:40:33
Brace yourselves, everyone.
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:54:45
Did it lose momentum because of Charlie's move to Coinbase, perhaps?
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:32:20
Wow, this is a real turning point for Bitcoin marketplaces: Quality from top to bottom. Amazing job everyone.
@_date: 2013-10-14 15:53:21
Bloody insane.
@_date: 2013-10-26 12:11:48
If anyone is interested in contributing to the effort, other languages translations status is here:
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:25:05
haha did you carve these yourself, Jesse? :) I would like to see the messy daylight work-in-progress shots.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:33:57
Do you know if that's also the case on OS X?
@_date: 2013-09-29 08:43:49
Sent it. Please confirm that you received it.
As for that bug, yeah, we know about it, and we're working on a fix. If you don't mind, please report any other bugs and things that you find over here:
Thanks for testing this!
@_date: 2013-09-28 21:03:42
A new build is on grabhive.com that solves a few problems mentioned here, has a few test applications packed in, and also an integrated auto-updater. If you downloaded in the 5 hours since this post was made, you might try again.
@_date: 2013-10-07 14:33:20
Still looking forward to this if you're on for it.
Please post here:
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:58:18
Good points and great frames.
@_date: 2013-09-28 16:42:04
Fair point. This post is really a flag-wave targeted to developers and potential partners. We'll make an announcement when we have a version more advanced in its security and backup features.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:09:51
Does Apple have the _ability_ to do remote deletions?
@_date: 2013-10-14 14:13:44
This pull request was made in anticipation of Hive's upcoming "First run wizard":
We hope it's helpful in other respects as well!
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:14:13
It's just an estimate at this point. Do you think it's too high?
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:16:00
Thank you very much! It was made by Katarzyna Owczarek (who unfortunately doesn't have a webpage!) and this talented guy: 
@_date: 2013-10-14 19:13:25
That's a superb idea for a mailing list. Please do it.
@_date: 2013-09-29 05:25:37
Ouch, I'm very sorry about that. Hey, send me a Bitcoin address and I will refund you from our account. And I got another report about that actually, so I guess we should remove MineField for now.
@_date: 2013-11-02 12:42:16
Will continue to upvote each time it is posted. It's high time this kind of thinking goes mainstream.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:47:11
Yeah he REALLY might not appreciate that, dude.
@_date: 2013-09-28 21:21:41
Hey guys, thanks! Cool site you have there, we should make an app!
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:01:23
How could we not!
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:28:30
Does that imply that they actually created Silk Road in the first place?
@_date: 2013-09-28 21:19:08
I should also mention that users are free to strip the fees from our client and release a kind of "HiveLite" if they really feel that strongly about it. Free as in freedom, you know. ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:00:37
Hive will be representing too. Looking forward to it.
@_date: 2013-10-16 10:05:57
Thank you for the feedback! Do you mind if I cross-post to the GitHub (or maybe you want to do it) so the original poster can see it?
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:01:40
GPLv3, we'll include the required docs.
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:17:58
Nice move, Bitcoin Foundation.
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:18:26
Jason King = automatic upvote
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:09:01
Best of luck to you guys.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:39:17
Sure, but on the other hand, that's no solution: its clear that the Jailbreak scene is pretty exhausted with trying to compete against Apple's constant updates and patching; there just isn't much innovation there.
Think about it: Asking users to stay on some specific version of the OS is not an acceptable solution, especially as Apple's SDKs are increasingly intolerant of backwards compatibility. When app updates require the near-very-latest OS, it's not much fun to be jailbroken.
We just have to live with the way things are on the iPhone, it seems. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 08:02:18
If you mean a Hive app, soon.
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:58:11
Indeed, Bitcoin conferences in Europe are really too expensive. Unfortunately that tends to draw a certain kind of crowd in, very much to the exclusion of others.
@_date: 2013-09-28 15:45:10
Please note our caveat that this version is for testing and development purposes only! Please do not move any money into it that you cannot afford to lose. With that being said, have at it and thanks in advance for your feedback. :-)
@_date: 2013-10-07 19:12:24
Same here. Alright folks, it's time.
@_date: 2013-10-26 12:45:08
This is pretty simple at the moment, you can edit your ads and release escrows. We'll add more functionality as more functionality is added to the LocalBitcoins API.
@_date: 2013-11-15 08:29:08
This is going to be awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:22:26
This post describes a method by which users of Bitcoin wallets can exchange contact information as an extension of the Payment Protocol to improve the experience of sending bitcoins between non-merchant users. This represents a request-for-comment from the Bitcoin community and all feedback is appreciated.
This is something we'd like to see included in Hive. Feedback appreciated!
@_date: 2013-07-15 10:34:06
Direct GitHub link: 
@_date: 2013-09-28 16:43:18
Categories will appear as more applications are developed. We have it designed, but it didn't quite look satisfying without at least a decent number of them. Soon, soon. Thanks for your comment!
@_date: 2013-10-16 09:12:30
Hi guys,
We're considering implementing a user's idea for scheduled transactions. We just wanted to take a quick survey to see if this is something that a lot of you would want in a Bitcoin wallet, and also hopefully get some comments about how best to do it. Internally, we're torn! It was a little scary for some of us (possibility of auto-paying when nearly broke), but quite exciting for others.
Thanks for your thoughts!
-Hive team
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:59:26
Finally some truly intelligent commentary from the world of venture capital.
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:40:57
Just start with a very small amount. As Gavin says, "don't put more in than you can afford to lose". That's the best toe-dipping advice we could give!
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:17:10
Thanks a lot! Check back with us in a couple of months, we're pretty confident that it will be in a much more stable and secure place by then.
@_date: 2013-09-29 05:24:47
Something like this? :)
Yes we are based in Europe, and yes we will have localizations. Hopefully some of you will send pull requests for the languages you grok?
And about testnet, please see the bottom of this page:
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:20:10
Nice as Coinbase truly is, such are the perils of centralization.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:48:22
Nice work gentlemen!
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:05:02
Special thanks to Nicolò Maria Lazzarin!
PS: Sorry if it's too many posts today, guys. Lots of activity today that we're super excited about. If it keeps going like this we'll probably have to setup our own subreddit. ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-09 14:55:38
Ha thanks, really curious to know what was said. :-)
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:34:32
Congratulations Adam and team, keep on keepin' on!
@_date: 2013-11-01 22:30:46
That's not really the angle of this piece.
@_date: 2013-09-29 05:32:10
You understand that the fee would only be for transactions that happen within the context of apps though, right? In other words, there would be no fees for person-to-person transactions, or for transactions that happen in "applications" that we don't have some kind of special arrangement with.
That being said though, what kind of a fee would you be OK with? Your point about a middleman is well taken, believe me. It's one of the reasons we love Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:04:56
We're really excited about this project, and hope it grows.
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:57:00
Can we stop calling them "math-based" currencies, please? What's wrong with cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:54:59
That's right, but I've spoken with Stick and am pretty sure he's going to merge it in (we were invited to create the pull request in fact).
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:07:25
Preach it brother.
@_date: 2013-10-15 11:45:32
Admittedly though it seems that "Baidu Jashule" is one service, and that this is not about Baidu as a whole.
@_date: 2013-10-15 19:42:27
Hi there! Can you please email w about that? Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:35:36
Charlie Shrem did.
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:46:10
Indeed, that's missing, and avatar support is incomplete. In a few weeks those two features should be satisfied. Try grabbing the build that will be uploaded in 2-3 hours as well, it comes with a working auto-updater and has many bugfixes.
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:10:46
Ufasoft coin, but we haven't tried it yet!
We are considering doing something like this with Hive as well.
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:28:52
Maybe they created it in the first place.
@_date: 2013-09-29 05:21:47
Unfortunately the current version has nothing like that, though there IS a warning on the webpage. That being said, we'll add this today -- thanks for reminding us to be sensible.
@_date: 2013-10-07 19:11:51
Roger you amazing motherfucker.
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:25:25
This product looks so great.
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:03:25
Yeah that doesn't sound good. Sounds like a hack due to bad password practices, actually. :( Emailing Chan, maybe something went horribly wrong. Will report back if I get a response.
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:17:08
This uses Mike Hearn's bitcoinj and our BitcoinKit:
Congratulations, Jonas on a job well done!
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:17:51
Ha, renegade! :-) Well, thanks! And please do give us some feedback about the bugs you will no doubt find: 
@_date: 2013-10-15 19:44:08
Hi! I don't know if you mailed me or not, but we just wanted to answer your question. At the moment we're a self-starting open source project and can't really pay people. But on the other hand we all totally understand wanting to be compensated for hard work. Please do email us and let us think on it.
We appreciate your interest!
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:16:19
Oh these crazy streets...
@_date: 2013-10-09 15:48:07
You really are the genuine article.
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:33:51
We're also looking for a Cantonese translation, if anyone can help:
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:59:24
Looks incredible, great job!
@_date: 2013-09-29 06:00:20
Yes, any ecommerce, gaming etc apps (basically anything that is not charity) would involve fees. Everything else that happens in the wallet would not.
Does it seem more fair now?
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:09:29
Great job, guys. LocalBitcoins is awesome!
@_date: 2013-10-14 21:40:03
The LocalBitcoins part is now live: 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:04:25
As far as we know, we're the first to pay for their service using Bitcoin. Good support!
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:09:46
Well, let's hope this is a toe-in-the-water summary rather than something later stage. The conclusions drawn at the end read like Oxana has only just learned about Bitcoin and isn't thinking much outside her firm's specialty of consumer-facing web products (Armory's value for example is here judged based on its "site ranking").
Spark is pretty renowned. If this is where VCs are at with their understanding of Bitcoin, then we have a long way to go before these worlds connect amicably.
@_date: 2013-09-29 14:48:55
Change made:
@_date: 2013-10-09 10:47:02
Hi guys, we just pushed this app for donating to Sean's Outpost to help feed the homeless. We'll be distributing it with Hive starting Monday. Would love some suggestions about what to add to it, a blurb, a better photo, etc. Whatever will make it more compelling. Maybe a donation ticker?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:44:40
Really great job. Awesome user experience!
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:37:14
Great work to the whole team. We'll see about iOS, but you know how it goes with Apple.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:04:43
This just sucks.
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:41:01
Very interesting idea.
