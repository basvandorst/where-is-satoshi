(I stumbled over this on twitter) Wow, so your qr sends you to a tip.me url that has a tip waiting for you?! I don't know reddit that well, is there some way we can exchange contact details? - as my current project basically involves qr codes and BTC/crypto... your design would be another great advantage for bringing in new users to Bitcoin/alts

The link you send them to can check things like ip, and cookie (from a previous scan) this can be manipulated but not by the average user. A step further would be a prove your human captcha (but this would not be nice for the end user).

forget altcoins? I don't like the fact that there are pump n dump altcoins some other alts are ok if the staff stick to running them... but altcoins are inevitable and here to stay just like there are many forms of fiat. don't you think usd would prefer that there was only usd? So really this altcoin thing isn't going to go away but we can at least make it a little more user friendly rather than ignore it as they do effect the way the public also sees bitcoin. All i am saying is we should make an effort so that it doesn't look as crazy because noone can stop altcoins.

well the dollar has lost 98% of its value, so owning one dollar should be like owning $100. Now Bitcoin proves this by being around $1000 dollar per coin, it's not an unrealistic price comparison when you also think of the admiration we would have for something we collectively create, nurture and protect vs another "let it be so" currency. You value your kid! The fact is that fiats are designed to deflate and our money is not. So when Fiats become too much a burden Bitcoin will become loved even more, more and more. We value what we love. And yet think of the true potential, right now only a small group of the planet loves Bitcoin. When the whole world will need it it will have inflationary value. and we will control ourselves, the governments will just have to let us get on with it and move on to other matters (they might just start to like beer and football).
