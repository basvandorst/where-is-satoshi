I was marging longing etc in bitfinex with etc as collateral. What are my expectations of recovering my etc and or my unrealized profits? Will you account the losses as if i was holding etc or btc??? (technichally i did not close my position, so i was holding a lot of etc, did you close my position and you will account my money as if it was btc?)

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have CEO's or "officials" of any kinde. Unlike what seems to happen with bcore :joy: 
We see the straw in the other's eye, and we do not see the beam in ours.

No. I'm not forcing anyone to have a node. Miners Will have nodes. Stores Will have nodes. Exchanges Will have nodes. Web wallets Will have nodes. And all if them Will be receiving an economic reward for having a node. If a user wants a node Will have to pay for It, but he is not forced to have a node to use Bitcoin. Where's the comunism?

You seem to not get it. He can claim whatever he wants. He is not Bitcoin cash. I'm sorry for him if he actually believes he is CEO of Bitcoin cash, but i tend to believe there is not people as stupid to do that

Communism. Individuals must look by their own.

Once again you use words a true cryptoanarchist would be ashamed of. Bitcoin Code is open source and free to use because we believe thats the way to have the BEST code possible. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:38:45
cryptoanarchists talking about "official and correct website", "reporting" and "slandering" what they dont like and last but not least, comparing them with "banks"
SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!

There Is not a community opinion. Stop making up things that might happen among bcore crowd. We are free thinkers with a far more decentralized ecosystem. We are mostly libertarians which is the more inclusive than any other ideology.

where is this overwhemingly majority voting?
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:24:18
Thanks for the positive comment. Still i see anything goes forward. Time goes on, and each time a friendly solutions seems more and more difficult. Leaders are not willing to cooperate and shills and trolls only make it worse and worse.

I am not a dev. But i'm an engineer. I know a middle point of SegWit and bigger blocks could be done. This is not being achieved 'cause each party is more worried about simply "winning" the other that they don't want to reach an agreement
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:24:35
Looks like we got a usless comment :D
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:22:30
I wonder when luck became *personally* liable for fraudulently claimimg to be in place to decide what is bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:41:28
Are you planning to get involved with bitcoin again? Do you hold any?
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:27:08
you includes everyone supporting core developers.
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:52:00
im not a hacker so this might be stupid. 
But i guess that if the hackers have to provide the keys to unlock, there's some kind of comunication channel. So why not ask for txid in exchange for the key?
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:36:06
you are kinda funny =D
using your words, calm down
Im only saying attitudes like yours would allow the worst things happening, 'cause "things are like they are, and we have to deal with it" is exactly the mentality that has already allowed the biggest mistakes of humanity happening. if your tiny brain cant get it, not my fault. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:21:01
Man, you are disgustingly rude. 
Neither im a baby nor im whining. Im expressing my opinion, an im angry because im being kicked out of the network. I guess youd be the type of guy that would say a jew in 1940 germany to stop whining and leave the country.

I used bitcoin to send money to some fellows from venezuela when they helped me with some translations. Now we have to use altcoins cause bitcoin fees are higher than 2 days salary for them. i guess all those stalling the scaling solution are simply not bitcoin users. or they only use bitcoin to buy their 400$/kg lobsters
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:09:44
That's an outright lie. I might have expressed incorrectly my point, or you might have misinterpreted it. 
Or i have a better idea, you are just trying to dismiss my contundent argument with lies. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:23:19
man you live in a parallel reality. 
EDIT: probably you are just a troll
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:55:17
my anger is irrational? no one will miss me? disgusting attitude. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:55:45
man thats elitist af.
so now bitcoin is only for you guys rich folks? no more banking the unbanked? you have killed the use cases for whole countries. Venezuela for example, where bitcoin economy was flourishing cant use it anymore. you'd have to pay 1 day salary in fees... disgusting guys. and you are okay with it or even proud...
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:58:15
'cause my initial statement was only that i was being kicked out the network by high fees, something todd seemed compliant with. You suggested me to go to an altcoin and then added that no one was going to miss me. I supposed that you were compliant with the high fees too, as most vocal core developers are. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:36:49
calm down? maybe if you don't care at all about bitcoin you can calm down, i can't. I was a user of bitcoin and i've been pushed out, so either understand my anger or keep your "calm down" words for others.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:55:11
i've already stated i was not being personalistic. i dont think trustmeimhigh was doing anything to me, but everyone stalling the scaling by refusing to reach a consensus
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:16:06
yes, you are forcing me out of bitcoin. And it was not yours. It was not mine either, but i did not support kicking anyone out of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:41:51
man are you iliterate? So much money to pay stupidly high fees but not enough to educate yourself.
I compared you to the people that look to the other side and/or think the guilty ones are those being oppressed, not to the nazis. 
The comparison stands perfectly, you think high fees that kick away the poor from bitcoin are okay 'cause they have the option to move to alts, the same way there was people thinking it was not that bad what nazis were doing to jews, they had time to move to alternative countries.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:28:07
Okay, i forgot the second option:
you don't understand bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:06:07
maybe because they ended up in exchanges to be sold? ;)
