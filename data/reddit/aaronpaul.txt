Why **discuss** dark markets? Why not?
@_date: 2015-06-02 08:07:12
Dark markets bootstrapped bitcoins value.
Without them bitcoin may never have passed $20 a coin.
But ye, don't need to talk about it here on @_date: 2015-06-02 13:19:28
Thieves that use Bitcoin are not glorified.  This particular person got a sentence of life for running an online marketplace whos users sold drugs.
If you cant see why that is over the top wrong i can only assume your moral compass is set by Fox News or is malfunctioning in some way.

Its the narrowminded and judgemental that created this thread.
To try and portray the Dark Markets as a trivial piece of Bitcoin history is a mistake; for better or worse they played a large part.  Talking about them is not irrelevant.

I want to donate.
But I dont want to give my personal information.
Basically, if you donate, Amazon knows "John Doe" at this address and this email owns bitcoin address _thisaddress_ .
So, in the 1 in a million shot that Bitcoin gets outlawed by governments when their people are tossing burning sacks of dollar bills at their central bank and rioting, and when the government tracks down who owns bitcoin, the audit trail just got laid out by a silly $5 donation to Dan :(

Yes I believe BTC will be worth $1000 on January 1st, 2015.  
If it isn't, I really do not care.  As long as it is not zero.
You don't seem to understand some of us Bitcoiners are here because we want this technology to succeed.  We are not _investors_ per se.  
If we lost everything, a lot of us here would maybe experience a second or two of, aww shucks.. But our quality of life wouldn't change at all.
I dont invest $50,000 in one shot.  I invest what I would normally spend on absolute crap every week (like nights out drinking or eating out or some gadget that winds up in the junkpile).  So maybe I have $50,000 invested in Bitcoin, but maybe that $50,000 was put built up via $2500 a month.
If Bitcoin tanks, I have no regrets.

Same amount Western Union has.
By your logic, Western Union would never exist because everyone is robbing them everyday..
If I chose $4 flat fee instead of $2 and I handled 1000 transactions a day I would be putting away $120,000 IN PROFIT a month.  You think I cant afford security in Somalia??  And that $120,000 is going DIRECT into my bank account, no trip to the bank needed (the BTC is sold back via circle into my account right when its received).


This made no sense.  Have you ever sent money before?  Either they use my website and use paypal/credit card to purchase a remittance or they come to my window.  Also, the relatives in Somalia would show ID at my window.


Again, this made absolutely no sense.  I just described the use case clearly.  Remittance Office A has a Circle account.  Remittance Office B has a circle account.  If you havent tried Circle, you need to before responding because it not only allows instant purchase, but instant selling BACK into a credit card/bank account.


No vetting needed.  Just a legal ID stating you are the person the remitter said would pickup the money.  Does Western Union give insurance if you are robbed while walking back to your village with the money you received from them?  No.  And of course neither would I.  I can't provide you with personal security on your trip home because you received $100 from us..

Interesting this post is on the frontpage.  My son just had his birthday party (11 years old) and as a gift I was going to give him a full bitcoin.  Alot of the guests at the party are from their mom's side of the family and are the quiet old money investor types.
I had it all planned out. The guests, in the past, routinely ask me the usual questions about bitcoin (what is it? Etc) and i was ready to wow them with how easy it was to send, then allow my son to browse Overstock and purchase something to really drive home the fact that this is not just some digital novelty but could be used to buy a 42" tv etc.
There i am in the center of the old aristocrats with my skinny jeans and my tshirt stating that i drop bitcoins and not bombs. My son has his laptop and i quickly navigate to multibit.org to grab the only hotwallet i ever used and am familiar with when boom. Strange weird screen telling me the site is down. Ok, i tell my son to grab his iphone to install breadwallet and just use that temporarily. Breadwallet wont download stating iOs version 7.1 is required.
All in all it was total fail on my part for not preparing these things ahead of time. I couldnt do so though since i am a weekend dad so, just extremely bad timing.
Anyways, just wanted to share.

Why would anyone use their Bitcoin if it was the same price as fiat?  I wouldn't.  Get rid of the worst money first (fiat)
Bitcoin will be worth more tomorrow, fiat will be worth less.
And please link to where reddit admins say they lose money.  They use coinbase.  Coinbase has zero fees and the volatility is about 20 seconds (from the time u click pay with bitcoin til you actually pay is where the price is pegged)

If/when governments did embrace bitcoin, it would be hard to believe any _enforcement_ would be possible.
Taxes would have to be voluntary.  I know, I know.. Believe it or not, I do not think people would refuse to pay taxes if their standard of living were high enough.  I think the opposite would be true, I believe our sense of responsibility to society and those around us would outweigh any petty theft.  But here I am mentally debating myself..
Identities placed in the blockchain does make sense, but tying money to our identity would be voluntary.
As we speak Dark Wallet is being developed.  
As we speak, P2P exchanges are being developed.
As we speak, message programs that encrypt data from origin to destination and TOR are being utilised to prevent man-in-the-middle packet sniffing (government snooping on your packets via ISPs)
In about one year we will be buying our BTC with absolutely no identity tied to us, to Dark wallet addresses that completely obscure its owner.
You cannot enforce anything when that happens besides going directly to businesses accepting BTC or going door to door and confiscating PCs.
Basically, the government can become some schizo lunatic entity going on witch hunts looking foolish or play along with whats happening and basically understand the game theory incentive of our human race is to help each other; and depend on that.

A conglomerate of banks or a government can invest 1/2 billion dollars to either
1)  Make all that money back + some  
2)  Fool the market for about 10-20 minutes, wreaking havoc on the network at which time the other good actors demand they get banned.  This would be treated as a _bug_ in the system and the blockchain corrected most likely undoing all havoc.

I agree.  I think the complexities on the surface of bitcoin will be abstracted away with all the venture capital being pumped into the space.
Politically we will face problems.  Too many bought and paid for politicians and judges. 
Its funny, the front page of shows a well-adjusted, most likely well intentioned Canadian politician asking Bitcoin power players "What can I do to help you?" My first thought is "Wow, thats great". But then reality sets in.  As soon as he attempts to make well-adjusted decisions to attract bitcoin business and foster a bitcoin growth environment; he will get hammered by his peers &amp; higher ups, who are bought and paid for.  
Anyways, in terms of technology, politicians can slow us, but the systems they work in are depracated; they can be considered irrelevant if we choose so i think protocol is the real risk we face.

You said and i quote
"The media is mixing up Ghashes pool of thousands of people for "one miner" controlling 51%. It's literally in headlines that "one miner controls half of bitcoin and it's security is already 'shattered' ". That's a laugh if you ask me."
The guy that says one miner is controlling 51% of the hashing power for a given time period is perfectly correct, that you seemed to have laughed at implying you think otherwise. When he is right. 
51% was attained this past week for 24 hours so insisting that 200million dollars worth of equipment is too hard to obtain is true but very possible as we have seen.  We have also seen difficulty increases render the hardware useless, and if a company knew they couldnt win and were closing their doors and currently controlled 51%, its not unbelievable they would attempt to doctor the bitcoin ledger before failing and get out of bitcoin entirely.
Edit:  and i dont understand why you think people would write something down when i suggested if you trust ghash so much just stick a database in their office and make the verification system fully centralized and call them VISA.

Separate your bitcoins into a _savings account_ wallet and _checking account_ wallet (encrypt both with a long passphrase that u keep physically safe, dont trust just your memory).
Hardly ever use your savings.  If you have a key logger at some point in the future, they will steal your checking account first, which will tell you that your system is compromised.
The reason you will lose your checking account, is because thats the only account where you actually type in your passphrase.

In todays world, merchants change bitcoin to fiat immediately.  This is because it can be downward volatile.
Give bitcoin enough time to show how every year its value goes up by an order of magnitude (which I believe it has so far) then we can start using my gold coin/dollar analogy.  
I dont think many of us believe bitcoin is going to sit at a specific price too long.  As the creator Satoshi expressed, bitcoin will be worth a million dollars a coin or worth nothing. (exact quote is _I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large (bitcoin) transaction volume or no volume._)
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:34:27
Bitcoin will be as upward volatile as gold is upward volatile.
It may experience the same swings as gold, but even then you would rather hold gold/bitcoin for the long term instead of paper dollars based on their respective histories.

Understand if you do not live in the USA instant BTC buys are a foreign concept.
Buying Bitcoin for many in Europe started with scanning your legal id with a photo, scanning a utility bill.  Sending these off to the Ukraine or Sweden or some such place.
Then you could buy which means logging into your net bank, entering a page of information including a BIC.  Waiting 3 days- a week until the money clears.  Then in about a week getting Bitcoin at whatever price _they said it was at the time the money cleared the clearing house_
Now think Circle.  Instant.  Seconds.

This is the greatest speech I have heard for Bitcoin.  I have it bookmarked and sometime listen to it while falling asleep :)  
I must have listened to it over 40 times already (probably more than Erik)
I am a programmer and share it to tech buddies all the time.
When I am out drinking, I basically explain Bitcoin using his outline, methodically laid out.  
I believe this presentation will be referred to 50 years from now and used as a bookmark in human economic evolution.
So many great statements in the presentation, but one of the most profound to me was 
"For the first time ever, a form of money, superior to all others because of its superior attributes, has been successfully decentralized and decoupled from the material world in such a way that nobody can turn the system off.
And the world has never seen this before.
I think there is now a certain inevitability that markets around the world will gravitate towards the superior money.
After all money is a good like all others and competes for the attention of those using it.
So I think it is fair to say that Bitcoin is a monumental invention that has been finally captured by mankind.
And if you understand the deep and central role that money plays in every aspect of our lives then might not Bitcoin be considered as important as things like the printing press, the automobile or the internet?
And considering these other inventions, not everybody is literate, not everybody has a car and not everbody is online;  
but everybody uses money."  
Erik Voorhees
**Edit:  To the people saying I'm crazy or weird because I have listened to this presentation so much.  I have worked in tech going on 14 years as a programmer and Bitcoin is my hobby so when I have free time, I dont play World of Warcraft, I *track* Bitcoin by listening to Bitcoin presentations, reading articles and trolling here.  I don't see why listening to a high quality lecture is any stranger than *playing league of legends like 40 times*.  I get something new out of it every time.

51% is theoretically possible and requires us to "trust" the hash master to not do something.
That is not trustless.
We both agree that this will CONTINUE to hurt us incessantly, like a migraine until we fix it or until a bad actor betrays our "trust" (please dont tell me this will never happen because if its possible, then it is always possible). Trust.  Trust.  In programming that is code smell.  The architecture is flawed.
I just want it fixed now not later.  Its a race between the core devs and a huge scandal involving the 51% hashmasters who have someone internally who double spends a huge amount and thats when we lose the ultimate trust which turns all of us bitcoin evangelists into Amway salesman.

His talk with the parliament was moving to me because Andreas appeared so _comfortable_, genuine and sincere in his responses.
I didn't like the Montreal Bitcoin embassy statement that said "His performance was amazing" because performance insinuates acting.
I understand that it is a little _anal_ to judge so little a thing, but the 24 hour schizophrenic news cycles we have nowadays latch onto the tiniest of details and blow it up.  We have to be careful and try and do better.

Great post.  
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:47:05
The whole article, you miss the finer points.  
Not a flaw:  To say that bitcoin as cash is a flaw is wrong.  We need MORE cash systems and not systems that want my full name/address/the name of my first pet etc.. 
Flaw:  We are immature.  We haven't _done_ cash wrong, we just haven't **matured** yet to 1) fully anonymous (like cash) 2) bank like security (in the case of hard wallets, we use physical security)
You discuss electricity costs, I wont argue that cause I already did.  Bitcoin is designed with the presumption that mining may not be profitable during a time window, then the miners will pack up and go, difficulty will drop, then poof, profitibility again.  Its a self-correcting system which is part of satoshi's genius (in my mind)
Then you talk about how cash is good to buy drugs, this is what we hate.. Obviously I use cash to buy drugs i never use my visa... Why are u blaming bitcoin (just because bitcoin is cash is the paper dollars is cash is bitcoin?)? 
Then you touch on micropayments, but you dont hit home.  Yes bitcoin has the potential to solve micropayments, but heres a flaw.  It is not there yet.  Bitcoin's transaction fees are currently set by the amount of (incoming?) transactions (I forget if its both # of incoming and outgoing or just incoming).  Anyways, bitcoin fails at micro transactions currently because your $.02 transaction could come from 20 incoming transactions where the transaction fee would be more than 1 transaction of $1 billion dollars.  So theres a flaw.  But again, in 1 year this will be fixed, its known and doesnt even require a fork to fix (we think)
Then you talk about consumer protection.. We invented a transfer of value network. Thats what we did.  We invented electronic cash.  Let visa or mastercard handle our escrow if they wish.  Or bank1 or bank2..  Or maybe a peer to peer reputation system where there is no Visa or mastercard or bank1 or bank2 (like the upcoming open bazaar)  My point is, bitcoin should NOT handle escrow.  Bitcoin is the foundation of your house not the winding staircase to the tower.
Then you talk about supply of bitcoins.  The supply of bitcoins is divisible to 1/1,000,000..  So for practical purposes, the cap is almost imaginary in our minds unless all 7 billion of us have 10^36 babies tomorrow, and thats a lot of doinnit.
And whenever I see words like _anarchy_ and _libertarian_, those are all buzzwords to inspire FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt).  bitcoin is agnostic to all these belief systems; it just IS.  
Its cash in your pocket, that gains value instead of losing it, that can be sent instantly to anywhere around the world instantly, that cannot be counterfeit.  It's just money 2.0.  thats it.  thats a lot.  but thats it.
edit:  but its so much more than that :D (see what they are doing with smart contracts, digital notarizations)!  But, context-to-context, your article's context to readers, its money 2.0.  They can go down the rabbit hole of the blockchain in a different article.

My whole goal here is to put THIS on the top of the "next feature/bug fix" list.

Satoshi's genius in design decisions shows through again.
He estimated that bandwidth would not be a problem as time moved forward even while being pummeled about the issue; he insisted that users and developers be patient.
In my opinion, he correctly persuaded Julian Assange to not accept Bitcoin in its nascent stage for fear of destroying Bitcoin; and Bitcoin is alive today.
He designed Bitcoin so it's entire ledger is available and copied amongst all full nodes even if the size of it was often considered bloat.
His foresight is eerie. (I said sight not skin.. you...Stop that!)

I am not privy to _inside information_ nor am i of above average intelligence; in fact i think calling me average is a compliment.
My thoughts on why the Bitcoin price is being driven down though can be regarded as conspiracy.  I think a combination of inflation/merchant adoption/AND the fact there are shady things happening behind the scenes at exchanges.
None of this is based on fact, but i can see exchanges like BTC-E pushing their reserves out purposely to drive the price as low as possible, causing margin calls and pushing harder; then when it is driven down as much as possible, buying it back making huge profits.
No facts just feelings.
Edit:  When I say Merchant Adoption, I am referring to the pattern of merchants taking Bitcoin from HODLers and instantly pushing those BTC that was once snug sleeping in wallets (keeping the up price pressure) onto exchanges (making the btc act as down price pressure).
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:16:55
Does it take so long to transfer Bitcoins to an exchange?  It sounds like people put their bitcoins in exchanges to avoid one step? Basically, instead of cold wallet-&gt;exchange-&gt;withdraw $$, they do exchange-&gt;withdraw $$ (or whatever)

If you feel these explanations are too technical to understand, the ELI5 way to be passively prepared for a hypothetical _quantum attack_ is to:
99% of your bitcoin should be in a bitcoin address that **has never sent bitcoin**
Your bitcoins are now safe from attack.  Once the address has sent bitcoins, all the information a quantum attack needs to rob you becomes available.
Once a quantum attack occurs it should be widely known.

An example of bitcoin's flaws in your paper are 
1) bitcoin is cash (you link to an article where a guy got robbed after going to sleep.) im on my smartphone so i am not going to type with my finger for 3 hours as to why a fungible currency with a permanent transaction ledger (like the cash in your pocket) is a good thing and not a flaw. 
2) your second link to a flaw is regarding electricity use. Again, finger, not typing but.. The electricity usage of our current financial systems to do approx the same job is ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE greater than the power usage we have today. PLUS the article assumes the # of miners will increase forever when u dont understand that the system is intentionally designed to slow down the # miners via difficulty..
We know we have flaws.  But u guys never list them is my point!!

This is an extremely important topic for anyone that believes in a decentralized, neutral protocol for transferring value (blockchain technology).
We have to get involved to keep the pipes propping up blockchains completely free of **deep packet inspections** (which can lead to the equivalent of blacklists in cryptocurrencies).
Basically, big corporations are pressuring governments to incorporate laws that would allow for the **inspection of network traffic** and not just route it (which it does today without prejudice).  
This could lead to the blocking or throttling of traffic that could threaten big corporations monopolies or interests. 
What we enjoy today, the complete freedom of information that is the internet, may disappear tomorrow if big business gets its way.

Also, I hope wallets start looking more mature.  I have a little NXT and you should see their wallet.  Multibit compared to the NXT wallet is boys to men, no joke.

I really dont think anyone cares if he's called a core developer or not. And I am betting that Peter Todd could care less.
We are lucky to have Peter here as a counter-weight to all the short sighted developers in the bitcoin ecosystem like Mike Hearn (lets black list addresses! lets create super nodes!) 
He seems to understand the big picture stuff and is willing to put his chest out to the others which is good for Bitcoin.

Yes you transfer the bitcoin to your laptop.  You should password protect your wallet on your laptop (in multibit, file-&gt;add password to wallet).  Dont forget your password (write it doen) or you will lose all your bitcoin.
Also you should make backups of your multibit wallet.dat periodically.  If your laptop gets stolen or blows up, you can restore using a backed up wallet.dat + password

I will try and make this as simple as I can.
Bitcoin was created with the attributes of gold.  If Bitcoin succeeds it will be at least as good as gold.
If you could put $1000 in cash in a box and open it in 10 years OR put $1000 worth of gold in the same box; would you choose gold or paper dollars?  If you had any economic sense, you would choose gold due to the fact gold has historically retained its value much better than dollars **and its not even close**.
Merchants would prefer to transact with _good_ currency because, if they decide to save some, this currency's value _tends_ to increase.  
@_date: 2014-09-27 11:06:38
This is a very important point and thanks for mentioning it!
One important strength of Bitcoin that we don't hear too much about is the potential to allow the un-banked to actually make purchases online.
Understand that the visa/mastercard/paypal model has no use case to allow for a person with &lt;infomercial voice&gt; Bad Credit! No Credit! No Bank Account!&lt;/iv&gt; to purchase ANYTHING online.
The digital economy has become an economic powerhouse with unprecedented growth and allowing for people with money but without banking services (or banking services that are neutered) to participate in it will allow this growth to continue to increase exponentially.
Basically, Bitcoin as cash is a godsend for merchants because the demographic for their products just increased by orders of magnitude.
Edit:  Of course, where we are today, it is nearly impossible for these unbanked people to obtain bitcoin due to them having to use exchanges to obtain it (AML &amp; KYC) + bank transfers.  But when they start receiving it for services they perform (working in a factory, hooking, picking crops), they are ready to purchase anything they wish online.
@_date: 2014-07-14 21:22:20

Yes, in business, you have to make a profit.  Circle's infrastructure is already in place and I cannot guess what they would charge me.  They may even NOT charge me since the same value we place on their network currently would only increase by allowing hundreds of offices belong to their network.  
The real value is if the payment network is so cheap where you can undercut competitors.  In my example, that is Western Union.
Bitcoin certainly shows promise in disrupting this industry!

Once someone says "one or the other", they stop being a person of science and starts becoming someone who is religious.  I think both Erik and Andreas do a very good job of communicating this to audiences at their presentations.  Maybe that is why I took some offense to all the people calling me weird (because I definitely do not consider myself an emotional *fanboy* to Bitcoin but rather would like to believe I understand the elegance of its architecture and support that.  If Bitcoin tomorrow incorporates something terrible in its architecture I would immediately stop supporting it (supernodes! :D).
I love the architecture and consider myself agnostic to the coin itself.  
To say "this coin will succeed and this one won't" may have *some* value if your job was to analyze financial markets, but has little to no value in a technological sense at the present time unless the merits of each type of money were being weighed against each other (after all, most coins are copy/pasted Bitcoin/Litecoin code with a search/replace of the name (to an extent, I know there are complete rewrites but the core of what makes this *money* special is the same(omg I am opening a can of worms..))).  
*Edit:  I own Bitcoin, Vertcoin, Reddcoin, Dogecoin, Quantumcoin, Safecoin, **scans windows taskbar** *myriadcoin, even flappy coin!, devcoin, IXCoin, Nxtcoin, Feathercoin, (sold my DarkCoin, Cryptcoin because of technology decisions they made or appearent weaknesses), Peercoin, Litecoin, **minimizes open windows to check desktop** *holy shit something called zetacoin,.

I guess you would have to ask Circle to know if they would be the backbone for something like this before stating they wouldn't do it.  Most companies do things for money.  
Regarding your question.  Why wouldn't it work?  
A remittance service may not work if the costs of existential services exceeded the profit you were making.  
If the political situation didn't lend itself to what you were trying to accomplish.
If the number of users you might have expected to use your service was low.
Any number of reasons.
But then again, by the same token; it might not only work, it might prove to be incredibly successful.

Yes, 1.6 billion from North America and Europe you would need to research where the largest population is.  1.6 billion is a very large number.


Yes, more offices are better.  And since right away using bitcoin your profits are at least the same as Western Union with half the cost, you would open more offices.




As I said it was a thought experiment, but as I talk it out, it seems even better than when I started!

When you need to send money you usually take a bus or other types of transportation into the city if you do not live there.  Or you use a web interface.

Thiers Law seems to explain the pattern of behavior we call "hoarding" in the Bitcoin community. (HODL)
Some believe, because the longer you hold a Bitcoin the more its value will increase, then Bitcoiners will never spend their Bitcoin; then they use behavior of Bitcoiner's today as their proof.
When in actuality, what HODLers are doing, is getting rid of the currency that loses value (dollar or whatever fiat your country uses) since the merchant accepts both! (Thiers Law)
If the merchant didn't accept FIAT, or fiat didn't exist there is no reason to believe people's spending habits would change. (the roaring 20's was a deflationary period and I don't think anyone attributes the roaring 20's with consumer frugality :) )

Self regulation is not a fix.  Miners are greedy and core devs explained it is indeed more profitable to connect to pools with more hash due to ever increasing difficulty (the only way it wouldnt be profitable is if difficulty were static.)
The whole idea of bitcoin is trustless/decentralized, everything you are stating is _trust_ them even though they are _centralized_.
Trust the greedy miners, trust ghash.  Its an inherent weakness in our bitcoin creation and i want it fixed in code.  Wish i had the skills to!

The video shows the lowest common denominator that allows for the expression of power by the USA is the dollar.  Sellers of oil that demand payment in dollars (like Saudi Arabia) can be seen as a "legal tender law" for the world.
Basically, use whatever currency you want, but at the end of the day, if you want oil? You pay dollars.
It coerces countries into using the dollar.  And the United States can print as much as they want.  And the United States no longer has to ask the citizenry for loans for wars because the government can just print more (which devalues the currency) .
The video was great but at the end he should have said 
**if you want to make a difference.  Stop propping up the dollar and choose Bitcoin**
Divorcing the monetary system from the government is the only way we can pull in the reins of governments attempting to project power upon weaker states.

If you are talking about us pointing our miners away from ghash, we have been doing this every time! Whichever mining company that is.
The point is, if WE keep on bailing out the devs they will never fix it.  51% has been around since inception. They have not addressed it because (as Andreas A says) "its not a problem".
What i am saying is, everyone that wants this fixed should point their miners to ghash.io.  Its a flaw in our high level architecture.  Everytime you explain bitcoin to anyone and you refer to it as decentralized and trustless you are lying and you should feel dirty afterwards.  
The fact is, the Bank of Bitcoin is ghash or WhateverCompany.com that controls the hashpower. Thats centralized.
This is not what i bought into when i bought/mined bitcoin.  I would rather lose it all then support a flawed idea.

I think journalists nowadays fail at this thought experiment time and time again.
The increase of adoption of Bitcoin will result in the drastic increase of price.
If you are holding Bitcoin and reading my comment, let me ask you.  
What is your price?
$10,000 a coin? How many would you sell?
$100,000 a coin?
In other words, everyone has a price.
As the price increases, you put your one bitcoin on the exchange, it will get chomped up literally in bits at say, $100,000 a coin.
Your mom, my mom, the hustler on the street, the lady working the register at Mcdonalds is going _all in_ with her $50.
The concentration of wealth increases the value of the coin, but the effect is that, as the price increases, you; **yes you** will sell some when **your price is found**. Whether that is $1,000,000 a coin or $1000, we all have a price.
Resulting in mass wealth redistribution.
Non-tech savy journalists either do not understand Bitcoin and its divisibility or they just plain lack imagination.

For the average user it is.  The reason being is the cost per hash doesn't return any meaningful profit for the amount the average person can invest.
It still think it is fun to do though.
I use my 260 GH miner to heat my apartment now that the weather is colder.
I login to my pool account and see a dust of .014 BTC for about 2 !/2 days work.
The amount I could have purchased would have exceeded that amount if I just put the money from electricity into buying bitcoin directly.

Distribution through sharing is pretty much the way all things become distributed no matter what methods are employed at the production level.  To say anything otherwise is disingenuous (maybe not 10 years ago, but its 2014). 
I pay to go see quality.  Not all, but many of our generation feels the same as I;  we don't gamble on quality with our money.  We try it first, if we like it, we buy it.
As I said to your friend Daniel, this is a liberating quality of our generation I believe.
But I understand where you are coming from Erik and hope the production is a success.  As I said, if it is half as good as you say, I'm sure and I will love it and evangelize the film to all we know.

Via gateways.  
Gateways is a fancy term which can mean paper wallets with a pre-specified value associated to the wallet with the private key printed right on it.  Think of a farmer in Vietnam with paper notes in his back pocket going to buy seed with the bitcoin he received from the villager who bought his rice. The note may look like this  
Or via SMS-&gt;Internet (think of a farmer in Kenya with 2 acres of crops, almost zero electricity, but with the drizzle of electricty he can get, he charges his 1990 Nokia phone)
The blockchain itself and all the value (Bitcoin transactions) contained therein is actually going to be broadcast via terrestrial broadcasting (TV to us) as we speak in Finland via Kryptoradio.
Bitcoin and the blockchain is just binary data.  Telephone lines can broadcast it and they are attempting that now also.

Suffice it to say i was freaking out. I thought it was stolen.  Its only when i came here to that they told me my balance was still there (they showed me how to query my btc public address on Blochain.info).
I promptly removed bitwallet after that. Breadwallet just works.

Yes, you are a soothsayer and can predict the intentions of every single entity in existence regardless of what their goals may be.  Of course the incentive exists to not destroy the system in which you have heavily invested.  The incentive has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the system can be broken.  That is the point.
Even if the head of an organization has well intentions, corrupt individuals within can have access to the power 
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.  
And great publicity here regardless of whether the article contains any real value

My last response to you because, to be honest, i dont think you are really bringing anything of value to the table.
Yes no one, not even a great mind like yours, can predict what the intentions of any individual may be.  We both agree (i guess? since in one response you reply "you don't understand the incentives aren't aligned" inferring that no one would do this.. Then in another response you admit that you cannot predict what someone may do..)  I'm probably not the only one getting a headache by reading your text..
As I said in the initial post 
"We are all tired of this supposedly "trustless" and decentralized system suddenly having to trust this 1 actor (2 if u count the core devs saying they will "punish" mining pools that perform 51% attacks after the fact)."
What you imply is that we should trust this single organisation not to do bad, and even if they did, we have another single (that makes a total of 2! Wheee!) entity that will punish the other one.
Thats just bad. As far as architecture thats real bad.  I could type a wall of text here to explain why but instead will supply a link describing the two.
What I want is this to be addressed as top priority in the triage of features of Bitcoin and the blockchain.  Thats all I want.  I cannot see how you could even disagree with this if you are on board the Bitcoin boat.

This was a really interesting read!
Thiers Law seems to explain the pattern of behavior we call "hoarding" in the Bitcoin community. (HODL)
Some believe, because the longer you hold a Bitcoin the more its value will increase, then Bitcoiners will never spend their Bitcoin; then they use behavior of Bitcoiner's today as their proof.
When in actuality, what HODLers are doing, is getting rid of the currency that loses value (dollar or whatever fiat your country uses) since the merchant accepts both! (Thiers Law)
If fiat didnt exist or I had none, I dont think I would think twice about spending Bitcoin on food/transportation/vacation if I wanted food/transportation/vacation.  But if I have some worthless currency that you will accept, I will definitely use that first and hold the good stuff.

You are a troll so Im gonna let this thread die.  
To any onlookers 
in 1982  gold was $376.00 per ounce.
That same ounce of gold today is worth $1,247.80.
The buying power of the dollar in 1982 - today has lost 146.9%.

Hi and welcome to the community!
If you have your wallet on your PC, like Multibit, then yes; you normally copy the merchants address they display to you during purchase and paste it into the text box in the send tab of your wallet.
If your wallet is on your phone then you normally use the wallet's QR code scanning feature.
Bitcoin is still in its early stages, and in the future, we will transition to readable names representing account numbers and not the text jumbles we see today.
Onename.io is already doing this and making this process easier is happening as we speak.
Good luck and welcome!
Edit:  i see you are using Circle.  Yes you copy and paste the merchants bitcoin receive address in the textbox on the Send tab.

Late last week Coin Fire learned that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has begun sending out blanket letters to operators of various bitcoin companies requesting further information about the operations, fundraising activities and finances of the company.
Coin Fire has learned that eight companies specifically have been targeted by the agency for the offering of unregistered securities but to make sure that all bases are covered several hundred letters are now going out to a plethora of companies.
A key element of the letter requires that those receiving the letter stay quiet and treat it as confidential. They may seek legal counsel but they may not reveal the fact they received a letter to those who are not directly involved with responding to the letter nor the public so the exact number of letters going out nor the companies receiving them will not be revealed by those affected without legal consequences.
We have obtained six of these letters, each of them slightly different and each of them being sent out by a different Enforcement division attorney at various regional SEC offices. Companies that have not yet received a letter or whom do not receive on in the next two weeks should not feel they are in the clear as the agency is not yet sending out all the letters as to not tip their hand before other actions or because of international cooperation.
These letters are but a small part of an interagency, international, cooperative action that will be detailed in-depth in an upcoming feature that ultimately results in action against several large bitcoin and cryptocurrency companies that have offered unregistered securities.
Federal agencies said to be included are the SEC, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and we have unconfirmed reports that FinCen has also become involved recently.
Several members of the Coin Fire staff initially questioned the validity of IRS accountants being used in an SEC investigation but our executive editor Mike would later learn from an unnamed source that is familiar with the procedures used that the tactic is common.
Budget cuts have left several federal agencies unable to dedicate staff to the accounting process and that oftentimes a specific accounting team at the IRS could be called in to aid with other federal operations. We don’t have confirmation that the IRS is working with DOJ and SEC; however, it’s not uncommon. The IRS through CID has specialized talent specifically to parse through business and personal records and that oftentimes with these sort of cases with securities fraud that tax evasion often comes with the territory. The IRS employs over 2,800 special agents for these type of investigations and they are oftentimes lent to other agencies.
Each letter requests a detailed narrative on how the information requested is gathered, all corporate documents and agreements, all financial documents including all accounting books, tax information, a detailed listing of all bank accounts and information foreign and domestic, and details of all assets of the company.
“Document” shall include, but is not limited to, any written, printed, or typed matter including, but not limited to all drafts and copies bearing notations or marks not found in the original, letters and correspondence, interoffice communications, slips, tickets, records, worksheets, financial records, accounting documents, bookkeeping documents, memoranda, reports, manuals, telephone logs, telegrams, facsimiles, messages of any type, telephone messages, voice mails, tape recordings, notices, instructions, minutes, summaries, notes of meetings, file folder markings, and any other organizational indicia, purchase orders, information recorded by photographic process, including microfilm and microfiche, computer printouts, spreadsheets, and other electronically stored information, including but not limited to writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data compilations that are stored in any medium from which information can be retrieved, obtained, manipulated, or translated.
— SEC Action Letter
The letters are being sent out to companies performing offerings on Counterparty, Cryptostocks, companies hosting offerings with colored coins, and companies who have performed unregistered securities offerings via Bitcoin Talk. In all cases the SEC is employing a team of researchers to track down the people or companies behind each offering via forum messages, domain registration information,  transfers of funds via exchanges and other means.
We’ve also learned that at least one international derivatives exchange with ties to Australia is included in potential actions as authorities from both the United States and Australia are working together to complete a case against the operators.
The expansion of the total number of letters being mailed out was a new development from our original story that we have worked on and could be seen as preparation for future action past the first eight companies that we have obtained information about.
Coin Fire will provide further information on this developing story at a later date.

_The bancor was a supranational currency that John Maynard Keynes and E. F.

_The Economist_ also feels similarly
"THE Economist's Big Mac index is a fun guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level. It is based on the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP), the notion that in the long run exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalise the prices of a basket of goods and services around the world. At market exchange rates, a burger is 44% cheaper in China than in America. In other words, the raw Big Mac index suggests that the yuan is 44% undervalued against the dollar. But we have long warned that cheap burgers in China do not prove that the yuan is massively undervalued. Average prices should be lower in poor countries than in rich ones because labour costs are lower. The chart above shows a strong positive relationship between the dollar price of a Big Mac and GDP per person.
PPP signals where exchange rates should move in the long run. To estimate the current fair value of a currency we use the “line of best fit” between Big Mac prices and GDP per person. The difference between the price predicted for each country, given its average income, and its actual price offers a better guide to currency under- and overvaluation than the “raw” index. The beefed-up index suggests that the Brazilian real is the most overvalued currency in the world; the euro is also significantly overvalued. But the yuan now appears to be close to its fair value against the dollar—something for American politicians to chew over. "

The big mac price seems to me a pretty good indicator of a currencies value as you travel from country to country.  
I have settled on the "bit" as Bitcoin's unit of measurement (in my mind) because using the unit "Bitcoin" seems absolutely unusable for everyday transacting.  No one wants to have a restaurant bill be .007432 Bitcoin, I cannot conceive this ever being used.
So, I think of Bits, I think of walking into a 7-11.  I think of Bitcoin as a first world created currency, not a Zimbabwe currency, so I dont think it will be 3000 of a unit for a can of coca cola when I transact.  
20-25 bits for a coca cola "feels right".  I know I was a bit lazy to not calculate it myself but hey, I paid the people that did so..
Thanks guys!

 when the community says ghash controls 51%, they most certainly control 51%.  When you connect your miner to their pool, you are giving them your hashing power. Period. Its just like 1 guy with a magic machine pumping out PetaHashes.  They can point it to wherever they want. You, as a miner are not running a master node, you are running in their pool.
2 if you sincerely believe they would never do this, then lets just save electricity, stop mining, and stick a database containing the ledgers in their building.  Transaction times would be faster.
3 lets say ghash had 200 million in hardware, but experienced a rough year so are approaching the point where they cant keep up with the difficulty but own 51% of the network. Another pool, we will call them Elmo, has 49% is flush with money and ready to overtake ghash.
How much do you trust ghash now?
Lets say an employee in ghash manages to steal 200,000 btc.  You OWN the ledger.  Ghash has the ability to reverse the theft.  Do you really think they wouldnt do this?
How much do you trust ghash now?

Julian Close adds his name to the list of predictors who say **The End is Coming**
He is the number 1,432nd journalist/economist to predict Bitcoin's demise over a 5 year period.
Bitcoin has crashed and rebounded vigorously (4 million percent value increase in 5 years).
The irony is this: 
Most economist say "Bitcoin is a bubble"
Ironically, bubbles dont rebound in value.  They explode and disappear.  So **everytime bitcoin loses value, then gets value back is proving that bitcoin is not a bubble and has long term value*

If you are "for net neutrality" you are for keeping the internet "neutral".  
Basically, the way it works today, ISPs route your traffic to a specific website or online service, but they **do not look at it**.
This is "neutral" in that the ISPs do not "judge" the content of your traffic.  So being "for net neutrality" means you want to **keep it that way**.  
So lets say your ISP disagrees with Bitcoin, or a rival company that owns a website that you frequent, or BitTorrent; if net-neutrality is broken, they can **inspect your traffic and see what you are doing**.
They could
**blackmail** Netflix into paying more so their users can actually _use_ netflix without stuttering (because they intentionally **throttled** all of your packets going to netflix)
 **block** traffic if your using say bittorrent (even if your doing so legally)
**report you to the police** if you sent your mom a photo of her granddaughter and the isp thinks its child porn
**blacklist** websites that might compete with it or have an opinion not in line with the owners of the company (political or ideological like bitcoin), 
**use your imagination at how many misunderstandings/events that could happen if you can envision what your network traffic would look like to an algorithm sifting through your daily web traffic**
 This is bad for so many reasons.
b)  Right now a federal appeals court just struck down Net Neutrality and sided with giant corporations like Verizon, giving them the power to do what I just described.  The federal courts can protect Net Neutrality by reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service.  Doing so will give them the power to reinstate the Net Neutrality protections taken away by Verizon.

If the limits were removed.  My thought experiment.
So lets say I live in Somalia and I have a Circle account.  I open the window to my house and place a sign AaronPaul's Remittance Union on top of my window.
My friend lives in Paris france and has a circle account and also lives on the first floor and he opens his window and places the sign above it called AaronPaul's Remittance Union.
A somalian in Paris comes to the window and wants to send $100 to somalia.  My friend takes his $100.  In Circle he buys $100 worth of BTC and sends it to me in Somalia.  I sell the BTC on Circle and it goes directly into my bank account.  
Whole transaction is done as far as the customer is concerned in seconds. 
The Somalian relative can get the cash in seconds.  
Thats gotta be worth something.  The costs to my business are what exactly?  Zero middle men that need to be paid off or fees for some third party remittance clearing houses.  I could charge $2, $1 for my friend and 1$ for me.  That would be powers of magnitude less than Western Union.  1000 customers a day cause no one in Paris would use Western Union anymore..
Anyone in Somalia or Africa wanna make a deal? :D

Bitcoins value is based on its scarcity and its usefulness (+other things if it is scarce and useful)
Example of usefulness:  I just donated to wikileaks, bought a new cpu from overstock with 2 clicks and saved 10%, and booked a trip to Portugal via Expedia at a luxury hotel and saved 5%
When or if Bitcoin is not scarce or useful its value is zero (if its only scarce some may speculate on it but then it would be far far less valuable).
That is its value (translated to its dollar value, currently like $650).  Its based on usefulness(# of transactions), market fluctuation, market news, big and littlboy adoptions (whales of wall street (coming soon) and people like us).  (keep in mind its value = scarcity + usefulness + other things, but if bitcoin were not useful or scarce there would not be other things).
Bitcoin is different to the dollar because its minting is predictable therefor its inflation can be reasonably charted .  **Although** the currency's value increases (inflates) with adoption,  investors and market news, **the currency is deflationary** due to its hard cap of 21 million.
Bitcoin is inflationary **but its inflation lessens as the number of coins approaches its limit** slowly becoming deflationary (value increases)
The dollar is inflationary and keeps on inflating (meaning the value continually lessens) until it will be worth nothing.
Now that we know how bitcoin is valued (scarcity + usefulness then market fluctuation,big and littleboy adoptions etc..) lets look at the dollar's value.
The dollar's value is directly tethered to the amount of dollars in circulation.  The dollar's "money supply" is decided by 12 people ( who print seemingly endless amounts of money ( constantly deflating the dollars value (over 98% less value since it was created).  Your dollar value is tethered to the amount you print.  Bitcoin prints in steady predictable amounts.  The US mints billions of federal reserve notes.  Every bill created /counterfeited means the dollar in your savings account or pocket loses a little value.. 
Remember when countries had to "decide" between feeding their people or participating in a long term war? Not anymore since Nixon *untethered* the dollar to gold, they can mint billions of digital dollars now paying for both global power expansion + feeding their own people. Now that they do this, your savings is worth -1%, -2%, -3%, -4%, -5% as time goes on. These numbers and your dollars lose value every second u have them. Your numbers may increase in your bank account but their actual worth decreases.  That *theft* is taking place even as you read this. Forbes magazine: (2012 The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee) 
This means people get rid of dollars cause they believe inflation is normal cause that's the only paradigm they have known in their lifetime.  
The government will only accept taxes using its own currency (in addition, the judiciary branch will only accept dollars for damages incurred, like if someone sues you or someone broke the windshield of your car) which in turn coerces the population to use it (  We are forced to use the dollar not because it was engineered so well to be money (its actually poorly engineered since the centralized mint debases it constantly which essentially is stealing from people that hold the dollars) but because we are forced to (government doesn't accept bitcoin for taxes).
Since we have the dollar (and if its working so well) why do we have some digital currency named Bitcoin with a $10 billion market cap and 5,000,000 people using it?  We are using it, even when the amounts of merchants being only in the 10,000s worldwide, even when your government wont accept it, even when buying Bitcoin isn't easy where alot of people are from, even when client wallets are so hard to use and theft is so prevalent? **because it is just plain better.** even with all theses forces working against it and its inequities: 
**Bitcoin  is better than fiat because you can send it anywhere instantly (like handing someone a $20 bill except that someone is on the other side of the world), has a hard limit on the amount that will exist, cannot be counterfeit, is divisible to down to 8 decimal places,no government or organisation can debase it, manipulate it or shut it down, is durable (doesn't decompose like a piece of paper) and its minting (new coins) can be predictably measured (Inflation for Bitcoin falls to zero over time. Value for USD falls to zero over time.)** .

1)  Security is tough!  I mean.. It's impossible!
2)  The market isn't big enough!  I mean, how many live close by!? No one would do it!

4)  Then you mentioned security again.
@_date: 2014-09-12 11:18:17
But your assuming the people would be "better off" by doing this?
The reliability and predictability of the _minting_ of Bitcoin is a huge part of its value.
If any centralized _levers_ even touch this, you no longer have bitcoin and may as well just do what you have always done (the dollar IS a virtual currency after all).  
You can't get _a little bit pregnant_ when dealing with the blockchain.  If you centralize any part of it, you completely lose the entire reason it exists.

Bitcoin, with enough users to tip the scale between early adopter-&gt;mass adoption, is deflationary.
Rephrase the question to better understand OP's point.
Lets say 1 gold coin = 10 dollars.  You walk into a coffee shop.  1 coffee is 1 gold coin or 10 dollars.  You have 5 gold coins in your pocket and 50 dollars.  Which currency will you use?  
Ok you said dollars and your not special.  That is Thier's law of human behaviour
_If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else._
Now you are the coffee shop owner.  You see this everyday. People walking into your coffee shop with gold coins jingling in their pockets, but always giving you paper dollars.  You want the gold coins.  This is where you **find the price that makes that person say 'I want that cup of coffee more than I want this gold coin'**
Gold is an accepted store of value.  Bitcoin isn't quite there yet, but just look around.  It is happening before our collective eyes.

Ye no doubt.  At the same time, Circle seems more legit than Mt Gox ever looked.  Mt Gox management was ripped by the Bitcoin Foundation as being incompetent when they attempted to help them out and the red flags were all over the place.
Circle seems like exchange 3.0  
Mt gox 1.0
Cryptsy 2.0
Circle 3.0
But ye, the mentality of people is, this company is huge and they obviously will refund my money if lost (knee jerk reaction ingrained due to spending their entire lives in a fairly mature banking industry)
Bitcoin is money 2.0 but we are still immature as far as ensuring the safety of customer funds.  These services will grow and mature in a year or two.  I would be surprised if Exchange 3.0s didnt have some sort of "Insured up to $100,000" type policy within a year.
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:24:47
I think is seeing what you do not.  Blockchain based currencies are designed to intentionally remove controls from central entities, just like the internet.
If you are a country that wants a digital currency you would be better off just setting up your own servers with protections and you control its governance and issuance.
Blockchain solves the double spend problem in a decentralized manner.
Countries are centralized states, they do not have double spend problems because they use banks (centralized entities) to come to consensus on the ledger.
If you are a country and you wanted control of a currency, you wouldnt use blockchain technologies in the first place, since you had a central bank.

There is alot of depth to your statement that others haven't recognized.  
Technologies evolve continually even when the underpinnings of a specific technological invention undergo mass redesign.
Take your average telephone.  If you took apart a telephone 50 years ago to a mobile phone today, they would look completely different; and yet it is still a phone.
The layers underneath different protocols are many times replaced en masse yet still retain their original name; namely the internet protocol.
Even today the core developers would tell you that much of what the average coder that did a pull of Bitcoin 5 years ago would see as Bitcoin code would be unrecognizable currently.
So yes, just as with any business, the entire underpinnings can transform or be entirely replaced and yet retain the sticky name, Bitcoin.

This is what i believe too. 
Bitcoin has the staying power, the first to market stickiness and the characteristics to become a store of value (gold).
My belief is, in the future, we will be using alt coins who's value is tethered directly to Bitcoin, to purchase items. 
If we are buying drugs or hookers we use a DarkCoin like currency (anonymous).  When we go food shopping, i will use a 'green' coin so i only support products that treat the animals/environment responsibly. I buy beer with Dogecoin etc..
I envision an app on my smartphone that shows my bitcoin balance (like money u would have in a checking account) then it shows 30-40 alt coins i can immediately convert bitcoin too. 
Each coin would have its own ui with reader. When i pay i choose the coin, the reader shows and its scanned.
Alt coins are much better than bitcoin for day to day transacting and have properties that bitcoin doesnt that we sometimes want.   They are not competitors to bitcoin.  Just like facebook is not competing with twitter is not competing with email is not competing with sms.  They are variants that serve different purposes and have value in the problems they solve.
So ye i see bitcoin as gold, as a store of value, and the amount of alt coins u can create will be based upon your bitcoin holdings.

As I have explained, you would have more offices since your payment network costs close to nothing


As I have explained, hiring security is not rocket science.


 your english hurts my eyes.   You are gaslighting at this point implying that one has to _coordinate with a lot of people around the world_ as if you are privy to a deep understanding of the intricacies of international remittance and is so complex that the average reader wouldn't understand it.  
The Bitcoin payment network is nearly free.  Circle currently has zero fees.  Those are facts.  
The costs surrounding international remittance are there, but when you are supplied with a free payment network, you are miles ahead.  I do not have to be a veteran in the remittance industry to understand that Bitcoin or other weightless currencies would have distinct advantages in this space.

You dont have an angle??  You either do or you accidentally chose the **Cypherpunks** most **Anarchy** provocative **Bitcoin Won't Change the World** sentence you could as its **main** title.  Accident?


What is the _dollar_'s intrinsic value?  Intrinisic value is completely subjective..  Gold has no intrinisc value to a tribe that uses clam shells as jewely and also as money tokens, its a gold rock.  A hammer has no intrinisic value to computer programmers in Bank of America's IT department in ST Louis.
In economics we use the term _intrinisic value_ to express a commodity's value outside the money system.  Bitcoin was used when its market value was 0.  It was used. By that definition it has intrinsic value.
This is value


both are not flaws as I have described..

Quite interesting effect.  When you give bitcoin to merchants (including braintree/ebay) you essentially give it to an exchange (arbitrage all the way down).  So spenders steadily increase the available supply of bitcoin (but they usually buy back so..)
So basically I have no idea how that effects market price since spenders usually buy back what they spend 0_o (this is great!).  But it is interesting!

100% premine is what a centrally controlled coin would look like.  So yes.  The admin would have the key to the vault.
You would have to create the wallet yourself.  Bitcoin's QT wallet is open source so I would start there.  And you can absolutely remove the ability to create new addresses.  You are a programmer, you could do anything you wanted :)

Because Bitcoin would no longer be scarce
1) mathematically - you are increasing the volume of the currency 
2) you have changed the currency limit once. Regardless of the reason(s) why you did it, it can happen again
Since the scarcity is gone, I, and pretty much all holders of Bitcoin would dump it and invest in an asset that is actually scarce and use any other currency (like dollars) that is useful(Bitcoin's usefulness will be destroyed cause the price bottomed out)

People send you Bitcoin, you send them money and then issue a chargeback; keeping both the Bitcoin and the money.
@_date: 2015-04-24 08:27:25
Yes this is just software.
If coders hard forked to increase the limit then you would have to convince all holders of bitcoin to voluntarily update their respective clients to go to the new coin you just created that devalued our bitcoin holdings.
Good luck with that.

Peter schiff's position on bitcoin: there are so many crypto currencies, bitcoin is not scarce therefore not valuable (he doesn't get it)
Jim rickards:  i am on the fence regarding bitcoin.  Anything can be money as long as consumers believe in it. Let it age a bit more, let it go through a proper business cycle before judging (very reasonable)

Bitcoin is cash. It's better than the cash you have in your pocket since it can't be counterfeit, can be transported to anyone, anywhere, and cannot be stopped.  It's value goes up the longer you have it in your pocket and its quantity cannot be manipulated.
PayPal, visa and MasterCard are not cash. They are systems built on top of cash

Western union and Moneygram are on essentially a starvation diet.

The answer is reputation.
Money is essentially trust value.
Successful businesses values reputation far more than your one time rent payment.
Consumers that can potentially be scammed are far more diligent in vetting potential merchants.
I don't blame you for not believing what I am saying since the charge back "feature" has been marketed to you non stop for the past 20 years.
Exit scams do happen, but far less often than you might expect.

His point is no non miner would agree with inflating the supply. The actual users would stick with bitcoin. Once you change the quantity, you no longer have bitcoin.
The authentic chain would have enough miners to get through the initial tough period. People like myself would see it as an opportunity to get back into the mining game.
Tldr: no holders of the currency would go along with any change that messed with the quantity
