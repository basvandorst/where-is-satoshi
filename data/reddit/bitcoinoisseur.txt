bit harsh - what's vile and sordid about Jersey? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 08:42:03
Ignore the bitcoin part. It's an expert fund, so it's only open to investors who are deemed 'expert investors' - usually high net worth individuals, family trusts, etc (I believe the minimium investment would be 6 figures). So already the responsibility for the investor to be making sound decisions is on themselves. 
Secondly the Fund have said that they're using Elliptic &amp; Netagio for their  bitcoin storage, therefore the ability to 'get hacked' is minimised to acceptable levels.

GABI's an expert fund (investment fund for 'expert' investors - usually high net worth individuals or family funds). 
It's viewing Bitcoin as a commodity so that these investors can invest in the price of bitcoin without having to own some themselves (easier to fit into an existing investment portfolio than have to get your investment managers up to speed on cryptocurrency storage/security best practise)
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:38:43
Here's a link to the Director of GABI (the fund)'s thoughts on the matter -

“Our decision to accept Bitcoin shows our commitment to the growing digital economy. The real advantage will be to our international clients due to the fact that Bitcoin trading fees are much lower than international bank transfer fees. With more and more entrepreneurs setting up Bitcoin related businesses, we are seeking to provide greater flexibility to our clients who can choose to pay us using whichever currency is most convenient to them.”
“Having consulted with a number of industry specialists both in Jersey and the US, it became clear to us that there was no real reason not to accept payment in Bitcoin.”
Nice approach.
@_date: 2014-06-25 09:23:53
Strange considering I've lived in Jersey for the last 25 years and only seen a Royal once (opening some park or something). Mostly seems to be surfers, tourists and locals.
Edit: Just looked up this Michael Shrimpton chap - seems to believe a whole load of conspiracy theories (Obama-Kenya birth, Maddie McCann was kindnapped by German forces, terrorists had taken an old German submarine and were planning on blowing up the UK Olympics with a nuke). He's had charges brought against him for such public statements. From that and the interview you posted above, he clearly has a thing about Germans.
If someone looks like crazy, behaves like crazy and sounds like crazy, they're most likely crazy.

OP here.
I touched on some of these points in another reply, but briefly:-
I'm currently acting as an evangelist and have setup a community portal ( as well as run a fortnightly meetup. This lead to a few local reporters want to learn more, which has lead to the interview.

This is Bitcoin - there are no 'trusted companies' (yet... waiting for the blockchain to sort that out), only ones that have been around for more than a few months and haven't lost/stole/etc anything yet. Bittylicious fits those points already although for high volume, you'd have to submit docs for KYC. 
Having met the guys behind it, they seem very open and public about their operation and are trying to push the sector forward (via the UK DCA, meetings with HMRC, etc).
But fair enough, no one wants to get murdered in a parking lot so with localbitcoins, general intelligence would hope to enforce meetings in coffeeshops/hotel lobbies.
@_date: 2014-09-19 07:17:50
I believe they've launched but I assume as with most expert funds, they're not going to release figures until they've got some weeks or months of measurable numbers

Everything about this was wrong. 
She was investigating child abuse in Jersey not the Isle of Man, and she was writing about cover-ups by the Jersey Government, not the UK one. 
I'd suspect that the ban came from the damage that her poor journalism could do as the investigation was on-going and would've had to protect the alleged victims &amp; suspects. 
She is a terrible journalist with a sensationalist agenda to get viewers/readers. This might be fine for trash articles but when it can directly affect someone's life, then it can become very serious.

Also what was the first physical thing you paid for with Bitcoin?

There were a number of delays in getting this sorted, and it ended up being a more of a fluff piece about merchants accepting Bitcoin. Tried to get a far amount across but they ended up cutting most out.

In the UK (which is where mndassociation.org is based) the government supports charities with a system called gift aid which effectively increase the donation by 20%. 
Also as it's a UK charity, a larger percentage of the donation is likely to be used for charity related uses (research, etc) than in the USA. I can find the exact numbers but check out this for more info.

Sadly Gyft &amp; Overstock aren't massively UK/Jersey friendly although I've had good experiences with BitFash, etc.
We also have currently have 11 local companies accepting BTC (including a pub and a restaurant). We've got a current map of these at  and I'm also in talks with 2 local consumer groups with over 50 members in each about adopting Bitcoin.
I'm hoping to have had our Lamassu ATM arrive at the end of last month but there have been some delays in getting it out of the factory. Out of interest, are there any other European-based Bitcoin ATM manufacturers that are currently shipping?

They're registered as an Expert Fund ( and it would've been HSBC Private Bank (Jersey) that they were banking with. 
Jersey issues its own banking licenses to separate Jersey registered banks, so there shouldn't have been a consideration for the UK side of things. Although this has clearly come from higher up the HSBC food chain...

There's not a massive amount of info out there at the moment, but it seems like it's a way of managing a cold(ish) wallet that isn't on Blockchain.com (pretty much like a 'lockbox'). When you'd want to transact, you'd be able to send to your Blockchain.com web wallet.
I'm assuming the main benefits are
 
* easier UI for plebs
* stops the ability to fall for phishing/fake sites as it only works with the actual blockchain.com site
* it's branded to Blockchain.com so plebs are more comfortable with it and see it as part of the 'service' they're using.

Can vouch for Dave. He’s helped many a coiner in a similar situation and has been around for years. But as he said, if you’ve got no idea, then there’s not much luck going forwards.

came here to up-vote Lopp's site.
but in general - exchange price is varied slightly across all exchanges depending on liquidity, native currency, volume, etc. There are some aggregators for more of a general 'global average price'. CoinmarketCap is a decent overview, but isn't as realtime as some others so it depends what you need. Most modern wallets will display your balance value in a FIAT of your choice, and these will usually state where it's getting that price from.
But at the end of the day, a BTC is worth however much someone is willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:43:29
You’d probably come under the existing high value dealer or currency exchange business regulations. 
Either way, if you’re not doing your own KYC/AML on customers (and it’s a business rather than a one off), you’re going to end up in trouble at some point.

Binance .com doesn’t allow you to onboard or withdraw Fiat, so the risk to them is quite small from a banking point of view. 
Because localbitcoins has been around for a long time, and has been used for illegal usage in the past (not FUDing, but ignoring the buyer side, there have been cases of sellers operating illegally as money exchangers), I’m assuming they’re trying to protect themselves from future issues by requiring ID.
@_date: 2019-04-21 09:58:16
If you’ve got the transaction ID, have a look at that with one of the many online blockchain explorers. And send them a link to it as well - it proves that you sent it and it had been confirmed. If they’ve not received it at their end it’s either a) sent to the wrong address b) they’re using a processor (bitpay, etc) or an exchange that batch processes it slowly.
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:13:48
Yeah they would be able to do anything like that, but it’s always worth reporting to them anyway.

TL;DR - not a bad overview on how it works (although not technically true, it explains the fundamental difference well). Their choice of interviewees is a bit strange (Bitcoin Vape Bro who's doxxing himself, Jordan Belfort, etc). Some very important points on plebs getting rekt by scamcoins. No real technical interviewees and they were focussing on the price increase and the risks rather than the future potential of blockchain tech. If you only caught bits then you might see it as bearish, but the last chap was pretty bullish. Either way, Panorama covers major points, and usually for a public good/warning point of view, so they were always going to go for this approach. 
@_date: 2019-09-02 08:58:07
This is the correct answer.

Is it a Lamassu? If so, you should've received an email today about this possible issue - we got one this morning.

It doesn’t require approval. But companies that want to operate businesses around crypto want to be able to setup knowing that they’re not going to suddenly find themselves on the wrong side of a regulation. So by lobbying jurisdictional clarification (or approval for certain usages), it allows businesses to be able to operate.

Potentially although the wallet is on a server somewhere so as soon as it was stolen I assume the operator emptied that wallet. 
Plus if he damages the money loader whilst opening it, I'm pretty sure the cash reader won't fully accept notes. (Could be wrong)
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:30:38
Coming from a Lamassu owner - he's in for some hard work. 
1. They're heavy (49kg) and very awkward to carry on your own (rounded edges, not handles or thing to grip). 
2. The first side lock is a heavy duty profiled key one - good luck picking that. Drilling it would take a fair while. 
3. Once you've got rid of the external lock, and managed to get the catch to open it, you then have access to the tablet (possibly useful for private information, etc) but not access to the cash box. 
4. The cash box is made from heavy duty steel and has another heavy duty profiled lock. Little to no chance of cutting through without damaging the cash, so you'd have to drill out the lock, which would take longer still. 
All in all, unless he also stole the keys, it's gonna take him at least a week to get in (with decent equipment) otherwise all it allows him to do is buy some Bitcoin.

Mine (also sent to the UK) was roughed up with a small whole in the packet. The box seems fine (stickers intact). I've had issues before that packets will go through a sorting machine that has a habit of squeezing out the contents if it's a USB key like object instead of paper. UK post tends to want you to use a padded/bubble envelope or box. I'd suggest that for future shipping Mycelium use a small box instead...

Try to imagine that your 'coins' on your local machine are never actual data sitting on your computer (like a text file would be). It's more like your wallet (with you private key) is showing you what the global ledger has listed for the address' that your private key controls. So if they've been sent elsewhere, whenever you rollback, nothing would change as your wallet would then look at what the global ledger has inside those public address.
(kind of rambling, and not technically correct but more of an approach to think about keys/coins/wallets)

About Fintech
A contraction of the words ‘Financial’ and ‘Technology’, FinTech has become a ubiquitous term for any technology applied to financial services but recently has started to be used for broader applications of technology in the space such as Bitcoin. 2013 saw private FinTech companies raise nearly $3 billion – more than tripling the $930M invested globally in FinTech in 2008.

The Sunday Times' money section has usually been focused on UK interest stories, so I can understand why this was chosen instead of all of the other recent things that could've been chosen. 
I'd see it as at least it's an article about a UK Bitcoin business that's not yet launched and that this is a good thing, when it could've been covering the 'fake internet money' in the usual way. Someone there obviously has enough confidence in Bitcoin to treat the story as a genuine interest and not just space-filling fluff.
