Chromebooks sell fine.  Consumer purchases are modest, sure, but in my observation/experience a lot of the more tech-savvy schools are buying them because of price and ease of management.
@_date: 2018-08-26 18:19:36


Aside from having an actual keyboard, being significantly cheaper (both to purchase and repair), and - again - having significantly better enterprise management features (at least last I checked), then sure.


I highly doubt that.  I don't have direct experience here (I've never dealt with ed-tech outside of the US), but IIRC Android tablets are more affordable at scale and therefore more popular among schools buying devices.
In terms of absolute numbers, [iPads haven't been in the worldwide majority since 2012](  Most of the rest of the world uses Android, not iOS, for their tablet needs.  And that doesn't factor in non-tablet devices (like Chromebooks and other cheap laptops) cutting into that percentage even further.


I know from personal experience and observation that quite a few of those schools actually tried iPads first, realized they're too expensive to be able to hand to students (and too difficult to adequately lock down or otherwise customize), and switched to Chromebooks instead.


I agree 100%.  I suspect Fuchsia is supposed to be a unified OS to that effect; that's not an uncommon observation/prediction, by any means.  Android could potentially be reworked to fit this bill, too, but past attempts haven't been particularly successful (see also: Motorola Atrix).


I don't think they do.  Even in the education sector, where Chromebooks are dominant, most students aren't doing heavy-duty content creation (I certainly wouldn't count word processing or making slideshows in that category).  Even when they are, it's usually for a specific class, and even an iPad is more often than not insufficient (since the sorts of software being taught are things like Photoshop or AutoCAD that - while they do technically have iOS or Android versions - are usually used on full-blown workstations in the real world, and therefore preferably taught on similar workstations, whether running macOS or Windows).
Google's Pixelbook does seem to be billed to somewhat heavier-duty content creation, what with its pen and souped-up specs, but Chromebooks - like most netbooks - are designed for content consumption, and do a reasonably good job of it.

Yeah, on an individual basis.  Combined, Android tablets outsell iPads rather significantly, as the Statista link clearly shows.


I highly doubt it will really be "full".  Even if it is, I highly doubt it'll run acceptably well even on an iPad Pro, let alone on a non-Pro iPad.


Of course it does (wasn't always the case, but it certainly is now).  So do Chromebooks, Android tablets, etc., and at better price points.


I can pick up a [ruggedized Chromebook]( for more than $100 less than even the cheapest new iPads, and it'll be able to handle a lot more abuse from careless/reckless students/teachers than an iPad ever will (unless Apple starts breaking from its typical design language and makes ruggedized hardware, which is unlikely); hell, it's specifically designed and marketed for classroom use.  Sure, you can get ruggedized cases for iPads, but students can remove cases a lot more easily than they can un-ruggedize an actually-ruggedized laptop.  I ain't a huge Celeron fan, but it's perfectly fine for classwork (I've seen far worse out there).  2GB of RAM is exactly on-par with the $300 iPads (and there's a 4GB option that's still way cheaper than an iPad).
That price advantage is by no means eliminated on an individual level even.  If we multiply that by, say, 20 students in a classroom (and that's conservative, knowing US class sizes these days, but hey, maybe things are different abroad), that's $2,000 saved right off the bat, plus additional money saved through the lifetime of the laptops due to wear and tear being less of an issue.  That $2,000+ can thus go right back into other classroom supplies.


ChromeOS itself supports portrait mode just fine, and the 2-in-1 laptop/tablet hybrids even support auto-rotate.  [Lenovo sells such Chromebooks]( and like the ASUS one linked above, they're ruggedized and cheaper than iPads (though not *as* cheaper; the touchscreen does add a little bit of a premium).


I haven't personally tried it yet (my last foray with Chromebooks was before Android compatibility launched, though I might pick up a Pixelbook while they're on sale on Amazon), but I've heard it actually works pretty well (aside from the typical issues with shoehorning touch-centric apps into a keyboard/mouse world, though that's less of an issue on the convertible and tablet-only Chromebooks).  Not surprising, really; ChromeOS and Android are both Linux-based, so it's possible to stick the Android runtime in a container and go from there.  [Anbox]( is an example of this generalized to traditional GNU/Linux instead of ChromeOS (with some significant differences, e.g. the lack of a Play Store and fewer exceptions to the sandbox).

I think that's what a lot of folks are missing.  I don't believe any of the current cryptos are the end-all-be-all of cryptocurrency.  Not Bitcoin, not dogecoin, not Litecoin or Peercoin or Verticoin or Africoin or whatever other *Coin that's emerged so far.  They're experiments - compelling ones, to be sure, and very promising for a future of decentralized currency and economic freedom, but experiments nonetheless, and should be treated as such in order to create a more robust long-term solution to the problems currently faced with mainstream non-crypto currencies.
Personally, I think dogecoin is accidentally innovative in its lack of a hard cap on the supply of currency; while that decision got plenty of flak for behaving opposite of what's expected of a cryptocurrency (usually with snide comparisons to fiat currencies), many of those criticisms fail to take into account the fact that dogecoin's "inflation" (we'll see if it actually amounts to being inflation) is both well-defined and tightly controlled (providing the perceived benefits of slightly-inflationary currency - namely, the ability for loans to operate without significantly hurting debtors *or* lenders) while still providing the benefits of a cryptocurrency (decentralized, anonymous, easy to use for electronic payment, etc.).  It's something that should be considered in the event that "Bitcoin 2.0" (whatever that may be) appears on the drawing board: is a fixed supply of currency really the best option for something that's meant to become a mainstream global currency?
Meanwhile, I'm sure other cryptocurrencies have their own innovative features that should be explored (I'm not familiar with very many other cryptos outside of Bitcoin, dogecoin, and a smidge of Namecoin, so I wouldn't know of any specifics here) and considered as influences for whatever becomes the "ideal" cryptocurrency that is taken up.  Whatever the case, it's important to not get caught up in one particular currency or another and forget that there's room for cryptocurrency in general to evolve beyond what we've currently conceived.  It's still a young concept; modern money has taken centuries to develop, and it's only logical to keep that in mind as we decide the future of an increasingly-digital global economy.

If you read the rest of the article, he rather clearly states that there were (and possibly still are) well-informed users, but that as the currency has gone mainstream, more and more uninformed users have flocked to it.  This tends to cause ideological feedback loops - the proverbial "circle-jerks" - that are increasingly difficult to temper with factual information.
If anything, Bitcoin and dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies have driven me *away* from hardline libertarianism and into a more moderate stance, since they've forced me to learn about economic theories regarding currency in order to truly understand the pros and cons of current implementations - and the underlying concepts - of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:38:54
They mentioned that they've been talking to other experts as well.  They're probably just trying to get a general idea of the current and future cryptocurrency (and particularly Bitcoin) ecosystem and understand really what it is and/or isn't, as well as to establish some sort of recommendation as to what sorts of regulation - if any - would be required to make Bitcoin work for Canadian interests.
The tone of their questions, however, seems to imply - to me at least - that they're cautious but already welcoming of Bitcoin's potential contributions to the Canadian financial environment, and are interested in fostering the potential benefits rather than stifle it with excessive regulations and restrictions.  The latter of the French-speaking delegates (I think from Quebec?) seemed to be the only one who seemed to be particularly resistant to Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrencies in general (indicated chiefly by his vocal concerns for the potential disruption of the incumbent banking industry, and whether or not said disruption would be a good thing).
Basically, I think everything in that discussion is a good sign of things to come.

I don't agree with the bits about no bank association (since there hypothetically *could* be a cryptocurrency bank; sites like MtGox and Coinbase are possible prototypes for such a scheme), but the point about Bitcoin having a fixed money supply is spot-on, as is the point about Bitcoin's value fluctuating wildly.  It's a good medium of exchange, but it's currently a poor unit of account and an unpredictable store of value; a fixed number of coins will not help this at all.
If I'm going to enter a contract where I receive a loan of 200 Bitcoins to buy a house and have to pay back 2 Bitcoins a month (i.e. a Bitcoin-based mortgage loan), I'm financially screwed if Bitcoin experiences another massive jump in value like it did late last year.  At the same time, it's not good for the lender if Bitcoin falls in value (like it has been since the aforementioned jump, especially with all this MtGox nonsense).  A slight and predictable amount of inflation (as opposed to wild deflation - like Bitcoin or a strictly-gold-standard currency is susceptible to - or wild deflation - like fiat currencies are susceptible to) is generally ideal; neither debtors nor lenders are significantly hurt, while fiat currencies hurt lenders and fixed-supply currencies hurt debtors.

Obviously the schools felt that they wanted/needed them.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have opted to buy them.
Meanwhile, I do have multiple family members who use Chromebooks as their daily drivers because they can't afford much more than that (and also don't have the technical know-how to deal with Windows malware, maintenance, etc.).  They demonstrably want/need them.


Google actually applies a similar degree of design constraints to Android devices - or more accurately, besides maybe the keyboard layout, Google really doesn't impose a whole lot on manufacturers (certainly no more than they do for Android).  Manufacturers stuck to the cheap netbook design because that's the form factor and market to which ChromeOS caters, but there's not much (to my knowledge) stopping a manufacturer from shipping ChromeOS on mid-range or high-end laptops if they chose to do so (and Google in fact does do so with the Pixelbook, which is actually a fantastic laptop, or at least seems to be based on the handful of times I've played around with one; Samsung and HP also offer mid-range Chromebooks, as do Lenovo and Dell for the enterprise markets, IIRC).
Of course, ChromeOS *is* tailored to cheap netbooks, and schools do seem to like them specifically because they're cheap (and also because ChromeOS has a lot of enterprise-grade management features - including some tailored specifically for schools - that make it really easy to deploy and maintain a fleet of Chromebooks on a school-wide or district-wide level; Apple's management solutions for iOS are lacking in comparison, though they've certainly gotten better, probably in response to Chromebooks making inroads at schools).
Yeah, there are better laptops out there, but Chromebooks do serve their purpose relatively well.  The hardware's actually pretty decent given the prices, and while I don't really care for ChromeOS myself, I'd much rather use it (whether personally or as a candidate for mass deployment) than iOS.

That's why I have a good feeling about dogecoin, though.  Most of the "to the moon" stuff isn't meant to be taken seriously; other than the few pump-and-dumpers that trickled over from their other attempts to turn cryptocurrencies into get-rich-quick schemes, very few "shibes" (at least in my observation) care much about the numeric value relative to other currencies, so long as doge can be used to buy and sell goods and services with minimal fuss.
The great thing, though, is that the concept of a cryptocurrency is young enough to permit social experimentation.  The broader crypto community is throwing all kinds of ideas at the wall and seeing what sticks, and it's pretty cool to watch that process and be a part of it, especially since - maybe not immediately, but eventually - that process will help turn cryptocurrency from an experimental concept to a tried-and-true and robust component of a global economy.

Well put.  The term "proletariat's cryptocurrency" has been thrown around quite a bit on already, and it makes quite a bit of sense.
I try to avoid direct comparisons to the physical-world's precious metal markets; while precious metals have aesthetic (i.e. in jewelry) and practical (i.e. in electronics) use, cryptocurrencies are generally limited to being a store of monetary value - hence producing different dynamics when it comes to (in|de)flation.

If said hostel owner doesn't care about fiat conversion, then simply setting up your run-of-the-mill Bitcoin client would probably do the trick.  Depending on his customer volume, simply printing out a QR code of the hostel's Bitcoin address (or having an old computer monitor to display it) and having customers scan it and wait for a moment while it actually lands in his wallet would probably suffice.
If said hostel owner *does* care about fiat conversion, then he'll additionally need to find someone willing to pay quetzals (or some other fiat currency easily exchangeable with quetzals) for his newly-acquired Bitcoins on a regular basis.  I don't know of any professional exchanges in Guatemala to do this, however, nor am I familiar at all with Guatemalan financial laws/regulations, let alone the legalities involved in setting up such an exchange or otherwise acting as one.

[It was actually completely accidental, and stemmed from a bug.](  Basically, the block reward will end up being fixed at 10k, resulting in very slight inflation instead of the originally-intended 100-billion limit.  Considering that coins are expected to be lost from circulation at a similarly-slight rate (i.e. due to lost wallets), this ends up being ideal (at least in the opinion of most of the non-pump-and-dumpers, myself included) for long-term longevity and usefulness.

Which would mean that Bitcoin is more comparable to gold than it is to a modern currency.  That's not exactly a bad thing - gold is, after all, rather important in a global economy - but it means that Bitcoin isn't succeeding at replacing fiat currency, since it remains dependent upon another currency (currently, dollars).
Hopefully this will change, either by Bitcoin being treated as a currency or by Bitcoin existing symbiotically with another cryptocurrency in much the same way as diamonds/gold/silver/platinum/etc. coexist with dollars today.

Sure, except that cryptocurrency is not commodity money; it has no function other than as currency.  Hence why treating it as a commodity is folly.


You can "vote with [your] wallet" without "treat[ing] a currency as an investment".  Treat it as a *store* of value, rather than something that's in and of itself valuable.


That depends on it being spent, though.  Consensus among economists leans toward slight inflation being ideal, since it encourages money to be used as such without experiencing the negative effects of hyperinflation (eliminating the value of savings) and deflation (promoting under-investment, increased severity of debt, etc.).  Dogecoin's decision to balance deflationary and inflationary elements was a wise one in this context, since it encourages spending without doing so excessively.


Depends on what you define as "productivity".  As I mentioned earlier, the "tips" are usually given in response to "good" posts; said posts can be considered to be a "service".
That said, the implication that dogecoin lacks spending power beyond "tipping" is [incorrect](


Again: "tipping" is not the extent of dogecoin usage (though it's certainly nice).  It's very much a useful medium of exchange - *especially* since it's striving to counteract the deflationary elements that would prevent it from being exchanged (rather than hoarded) in the first place.

In this case "would" is more appropriate, since US senators would indeed care less about what he has to say than Canadian senators.

@_date: 2014-02-04 18:17:33


Has it been disproven, though?  Because - at least from what I've observed - there's still a very large number of Bitcoin users who are interested in Bitcoin because it's value is (or was) growing relative to fiat currencies, rather than because of how easy it is to spend and/or accept when buying/selling goods and services.  The emphasis is still on speculation regarding its value relative to other currencies.  Dogecoin isn't immune to this, either, but I see it far less on than I do on &gt; This is a huge downside to doge imo, because it makes it another inflationary currency. One of the primary points of Bitcoin was to move society away from currency that will eventually be worth much less, printed into oblivion.
Except both deflation and hyperinflation are - in most cases - associated with economic downturn and recognized to be a very bad thing.  The consensus among most economists is that low, steady, and consistent inflation is ideal, since it avoids the hazards of both hyperinflation and deflation.  That puts dogecoin at an advantage.
Deflation is primarily useful for those who already have money; debtors, on the other hand, are hit extraordinarily hard by deflation.  Bitcoin hasn't quite reached the point where it's commonly used in debt-generating scenarios, but if it's to catch on as a general currency rather than a novelty, it'll need to address a way to prevent financial agony when using it to, say, buy a house or a car using a Bitcoin loan.


GPU mining is still profitable because scrypt is less ASIC-friendly than SHA-512.  In fact, it's even less GPU-friendly than SHA-512; CPU mining, while not really profitable, is still at least somewhat useful.

This really isn't significantly different from using any other asymmetric-key encryption/signature system for authentication.  This kind of thing is already commonplace in the realm of SSH, where one has the ability to generate a public/private RSA keypair, upload the public key to a server, and use the keypair to login instead of using a password.
The one possible advantage I see is multisig support, but that could be achieved with other, non-Bitcoin solutions as well, and it's not even clear if that would be useful in the context of authentication.  On the flipside, having something with a blockchain would be a disadvantage, since having a public ledger of who's logged into what is generally not viewed as a good thing in terms of privacy.

Google (interestingly enough) isn't as feature-rich of a search engine as DDG is, though it's looking like they're taking some cues from it with improved instant answers.
Basically, if we were to compare DDG and Google:
* DDG has "bang commands", which lets you type, say, `!bi duck` in order to search Bing Images for pictures of ducks.  The full list can be found [here](  This is ultimately my favorite feature, since it replaces having to define search shortcuts in Firefox, and works automatically on all browsers without configuration.  Google (last I checked) doesn't offer an equivalent feature.
* DDG has a large assortment of instant answers, provided by a number of different sources (including Wikipedia and WolframAlpha).  Got a really complicated calculation?  DDG will call up Wolfram and return a solution before the main results.  Want to find out how much your five bitcoins are worth?  Just type `5btc in usd` and you'll know right away that it's worth [a bit over $3000 as of this morning](  Trying to figure out who in the heck this Satoshi Nakamoto guy is that Bitcoiners keep talking about?  Type his name in and you'll be [presented with a blurb from his Wikipedia article, as well as an easily-accessible link to that article](  Google has *some* instant answer functionality, but it's nowhere near what DDG offers.
* With the recent redesign, DDG will show you multiple meanings of the same term if the term is ambiguous.  For example, if you were to search for `fiat`, DDG will return a [list of terms related to the word "fiat"]( including both Fiat (the company) and fiat money (what someone studying economics is more likely looking for); clicking on the "fiat money" item will narrow your search to results about fiat money, leaving out results pertaining to the other meanings of "fiat".  [Google doesn't provide this functionality]( thus requiring you to look through the main search results in order to find what you're looking for.
* Speaking of the redesign, DDG is fucking sexy.  Google looks boring and whitewashed in comparison.  Not really a "feature" per se, but it does have an impact in my willingness to use it, especially when that sexiness is combined with the functionality DDG offers.  Beauty + brains = win.
So yeah, it's definitely more than just tracking (though DDG wins here, too; even with Ghostery, Google's still logging your searches, especially if you're logged into your Google account).

That's describing the general technology, though.  Bitcoin is a specific application of that technology, and is limited in scope by design (and for good reason).  So are most cryptocurrencies (barring Namecoin, if I understand correctly).


Right, but it's not [commodity money](  That's where you're misunderstanding, and why I suspect your interest in cryptocurrency is for short-term personal gain (we'll get to that in a moment, though).


Indeed.  Based on the current popularity of dogecoin, I'd argue that said voting is already taking place.  Easy to obtain, easy to spend, and easy to learn about.  Winning combination right there.


[citation needed]


Sure, but historically, slight inflation has proven to be economically stable, and both deflation and hyperinflation have been proven to be economically *unstable*.


You're contradicting yourself here.  It doesn't promote under-investment, yet it does?


Have you ever bought a house?  How about a car?  Anything that ended up costing more than what money you had at that time?  An increase in the severity of debt is nearly *always* harmful to anyone other than those who already possess wealth.  It is *not* a good thing, and to state otherwise is a manifestation of either ignorance or malice; I sincerely hope the former is the case.


It doesn't directly.  What it *does* do is provide a continuous supply of new coins, introducing a very slight rate of inflation to counter the deflationary elements of cryptocurrency and - as a result - produce a currency that's more stable in the long-term.


No; you're extrapolating words from my mouth in order to support your flawed arguments.  Being spendable and being a store of value are not mutually exclusive, contrary to what you are implying.


It's not like the USD *at all*; it's still decentralized (and not in the control of any particular government), and the rate of introduction of new currency is very much predictable.  The only similarity is that it happens to have an inflationary element (and not even that strong of one, mind you).


I never equated savings to hoarding; they are very different concepts, and you're once again extrapolating words from my mouth in order to support your flawed arguments.
It's the difference between saving your money to buy a new car and compulsively collecting Beanie Babies.


Indeed; I'm very much interested in its proper potential as a digital currency, rather than as yet another digital "asset" to pump-and-dump.  It seems that you - in contrast - have a vested interest in Bitcoin's value rising indefinitely; perhaps a stockpile of the digital coins which you hope to someday sell off before they crash in value again?
We can play the accusation game all you want; I'd be happy to oblige.


You too; it was a fun debate.

# No to Cash
**Danske Bank does not work in any way with cash. Nor do we set up accounts for private persons or companies who trade with or develop software for cash. You can read why below.**
"Cash can be used for many completely legal purposes, but also for many illegal ends. The simple fact that you can perform transactions in person - and other places - without revealing your identity means that we cannot vouch for the provenance of the funds - and we must be able to do that," says Søren Rahbek, Head of Risk Management &amp; Organisation in Business Banking.
That is why the Group now has a general policy of not participating in anything connected with cash - be that persons who trade with cash or who develop software or infrastructure that supports the use of the physical currency.
 In demand
"We are receiving more and more enquiries from, for example, young students who would like to set up a busines account for cash companies," says Pia Roslyng from Risk in Personal Banking.
She adds that it is mainly Business District and the business centres who receive enquiries from people wanting a bank that can support their cash activities. Our response is always no.
 Complaints
For as the popularity of cash has grown, so too has the number of complaints from people abroad, according to Pia Roslyng. They have bought goods and paid cash, but have not received the goods they ordered. Unfortunately there is nothing to be done, as the seller is anonymous and the transaction cannot be recreated.
 Drugs on the Black Market
In fact, there are numerous examples from around the world that cash is being used for criminal purposes. Danish daily Berlingske Tidende quoted several international media sources on Tuesday as reporting a leading player in the US cash universe had been arrested and charged with helping to facilitate drug transactions on the never-closed black market.

Whether or not replacing it is a good thing is yet to be seen.  I'd reckon not, since - historically - deflationary currencies have tended to make economic instability worse instead of better, thanks to the detrimental effects such a currency would have on debtors and their ability to repay debts.

Very good points.  Perhaps dogecoin *will* someday fade into obscurity.  Perhaps it'll overtake every other cryptocurrency (to the moon!).  Who knows?
What I do suspect is that encouraging a symbiotic relationship will benefit Bitcoin (or whichever cryptocurrency ends up being dominant when all the dust settles) by allowing more people to be exposed to the idea of entirely-digital money beyond banks / credit cards / PayPal.  If talking in "formulaic newspeak" helps to draw more people to that idea, then I'm all for it.

I don't agree with that; the regulation isn't what's necessary in order to be able to use cryptocurrency as a currency.  The fixed money supply, however, is problematic; aside from discouraging spending, it also makes loans problematic (which is vital to consider if we're trying to offer cryptocurrency as a replacement for fiat currency).
Whether or not one is a fan of it, dogecoin might be a step in the right direction here; the money supply will continue to grow, but at a steady and predictable rate (thanks to a bug that prevents the block reward from falling below 10,000 coins, IIRC), thus addressing both the main issue with Bitcoin (the fixed money supply) *and* the main issue with fiat currency (the risk of runaway hyperinflation, like what we're seeing in Zimbabwe) while not requiring any external regulation.
In other words: cryptocurrency doesn't need a central authority in order to have a money supply that can expand along with the economy said money is used in.  I don't think dogecoin is the end-all-be-all solution to this, either (since it doesn't really account for a variable rate of economic growth or - God forbid - economic downturn), but it's a good step in the direction of a cryptocurrency that can adjust for changes in economic conditions without government intervention (and/or - ideally - on a completely-automated basis with no human intervention at all).

@_date: 2014-02-19 10:49:47
I don't think you've addressed his comment, though.  This doesn't have to do with the market cap nearly as much as it has to do with changes in value over time.
Say you want to buy a house.  The house currently costs 200 BTC, but you only have 10 BTC and are (subtracting, for example, 2.5 BTC of bills and taxes from a 3 BTC monthly salary) experiencing a net gain of .5 BTC per month.  The logical step here would be to take out a mortgage loan for, say, 190 BTC (using your 10 BTC for a down payment), with a monthly payment of 2 BTC.  If your current rent is 2 BTC, then you're still experiencing a net gain of .5 BTC.  For now, all is fine and dandy.
Then, however, suppose the value per BTC doubles after a few months.  Your non-mortgage bills and your salary will certainly adjust as the BTC-relative prices of goods and services drop - probably to 0.25 BTC and 1.5 BTC, respectively.  However, your mortgage payment (assuming we haven't changed anything about how loans currently work) is still contractually defined to be 2 BTC.  This is now a problem; it means that a mortgage payment that was once somewhat affordable is now beyond your reach, since - even if you somehow eliminate all your bills - you're still 0.5 BTC short of your mortgage payment each month.  You'll need to renegotiate your contract or sell your house; the former will probably be difficult (since lenders don't like losing money), while the latter is of limited utility, since your house - which was worth 200 BTC when you bought it - is only worth 100 BTC now.  Depending on how long you've owned your house, you may or may not be able to pay off the rest of the loan, putting you in a rather dire situation similar to that of many homeowners when the housing bubble crashed in the latter half of the previous decade.
This is merely one example of why I don't think Bitcoin is perfect by any means, and why those holding Bitcoin on a pedestal and dismissing alternate approaches are - in my opinion - unwise.  Bitcoin is able to act as an effective medium of exchange, but it's not a consistent store of value or unit of account, and - if it's to be taken seriously as a proper currency rather than merely being a cash cow for the lucky early adopters - it needs to adapt to the real-world scenarios in which existing currencies are being used.
tl;dr: Bitcoin has some strengths, but its weaknesses are very much apparent as soon as the concept of a Bitcoin loan is introduced, and said weaknesses need to be addressed and corrected for cryptocurrency to effectively replace existing government-backed currencies in a real-world setting.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:14:30


It's quite the advantage, actually; it balances out the deflationary elements, which thus makes the currency more useful once cryptocurrency is used for loans and other scenarios involving debt (scenarios where a deflationary currency is about as far from ideal as one could possibly be).  It also defuses some of the risk of pump-and-dumpers, I'd reckon.




I recall hearing similar arguments about Bitcoin when it started to grow in popularity.


I'm having trouble taking you seriously, given the absence of capitalization in your writing.  Just sayin'.

If by "distros" you mean "Linux distros", then yes, HFS+ is supported...

I also know that Debian has some userspace HFS+ utilities somewhere in its repos (I know this because of the OS X / Debian dual-boot I maintained for awhile on an old eMac I own...).

Would it, though?  Most - probably a *very* vast majority - of not-so-reputable individuals and organizations operate on physical cash because it's completely anonymous - absolutely nothing tying a specific entity to a transaction and/or a portion of the total monetary supply.  There are certainly some cryptocurrencies which *do* offer such anonymity using various mechanisms, but Bitcoin isn't one of them.
As mentioned in the video, it's possible to use traditional law enforcement techniques - particularly of the human intelligence variety - to trace movement of funds in the blockchain and (with some pattern analysis) figure out the identities of certain actors.  While this might not be a deterrent for the majority of criminal organizations, many of the higher-profile ones - the ones that want to stay untraceable and hidden (think Al Qaeda) - would probably end up preferring physical cash for this reason.
On the other hand, you *are* correct in realizing that it would make some aspects of fundraising for criminal organizations much easier, since - while Bitcoin isn't entirely anonymous from a technical standpoint - it's not as obviously traceable to a specific entity (i.e. it requires far more effort than, say, a checking or credit card transaction to fully track), and has more flexibility for movement of money.  In this case, Antonopolous has the far more relevant underlying point: that the slight risk of use by nefarious entities is far outweighed by the usefulness for beneficial or neutral entities, and that imposing restrictions on the Bitcoin side of things won't have a significant positive impact - if any - for law enforcement while having very significant negative effects for those using Bitcoin for legitimate purposes.

There are a few differences; whether they're "advantages" is a matter of perspective.
* Many of the folks getting involved with Bitcoin seek to treat it like an investment - hanging onto it in the hopes that it will rise in value.  Dogecoin, at least in my observation, is less subject to hoarding and more frequently spent on goods/services (including "tipping", if we presume Reddit posts/comments to be "services").
* Dogecoin does not have a ceiling on the number of coins; new ones will continue to be introduced.  There was a rather significant debate on whether or not this was a good thing.  The conclusion was that - by allowing for the slight inflation - it would counteract the deflationary elements of cryptocurrencies and help solidify dogecoin as a currency rather than an investment strategy.  I agree with that decision, personally.
* Dogecoin is still GPU-mineable ("diggable"), which means that more people can start mining their own coins.  This makes it quite easy for folks to get started with dogecoin.
To be honest, dogecoin and Bitcoin are important to one another; Bitcoin is spearheading cryptocurrency in the mainstream business/economics world, while dogecoin is spearheading cryptocurrency among consumers.  Working together is of greater utility than working separately.

I don't have to beg; good projects tend to be characterized by good documentation, and it's not my place to demand for a developer to implement proper development practices.  It's in the best interests of the Bitcoin devs to invest a bit of time into proper documentation of what they're developing, preferably alongside any coding or design, so that they can keep the project properly maintained and organized.
In other words: they shouldn't have to be asked to do something that's of significant benefit to them.

When you're dealing with account information (*particularly* with accounts being compromised), it's extremely rare to find any self-respecting organization that *doesn't* have private tickets.  Again: this isn't for the projects themselves, but for the thing hosting those projects; there isn't the same expectation of openness here, and there's *very* much an expectation of privacy.
To put this in context, I believe Github's support tickets (as in, for Github itself) are private by default, and they're doing pretty much the exact same stuff that Sourceforge is (sans being a terrible company that's taken advantage of trust in open-source software to peddle malware and adware, but that's another story...).

Regardless of your flaming rant, if the value of the currency itself is significantly increasing, what motivation is there to actually spend it?  Is there any?  Might as well just hold onto it.
Ideally - if you want a proper store of value - it shouldn't be inflating *or* deflating, but instead maintaining a consistent value.  No system will perfectly address this, but at least dogecoin tries.

As did I when I was an iPhone user.  Eventually, it got to the point where I got tired of having to play cat-and-mouse with iOS updates and their jailbreakability, which prompted me to switch to Android when I switched to Sprint 2 years ago.  Haven't looked back.
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:07:14
Right, but it requires you to participate in the arms race that is jailbreaking v. iOS updates.  That gets to be rather annoying.  It's also still not quite as free as Android, given that Android (excluding Google's apps) is almost entirely free-and-open-source software (FOSS), while iOS is only partially so.
I had a similar attitude as you do for awhile, but after switching to an Android phone (Galaxy SII) 2 years ago, I was surprised by how much hassle I had to put up with, and relieved that I wouldn't have to deal with that nonsense anymore.

Funding the Jamaican bobsled team is an example of that exact hypothesis being proven; the team wasn't allowed to advertise Dogecoin, but the community was still stoked that they had managed to crowdfund one of the more iconic Olympic bobsled teams and "make Cool Runnings 2", and it set a precedent of "let's put our coins toward these absolutely ridiculous yet absolutely awesome ventures to show that our currency and community are real".

Analogy weirdness aside, I agree wholeheartedly with the points made.  Bitcoin isn't the end-all-be-all of cryptocurrency, and it's important to keep that in mind as various altcoins start testing new ideas to see which ones amount to an actual improvement.
Whether Bitcoin itself evolves, ends up coexisting with other currencies, or is obsolesced entirely someday, being open to changes in how things are done is going to be a deciding factor in whether or not cryptocurrency becomes the fiat-killer we're all hoping for it to be.

"Desktop" tends to include laptops, since they usually run the same software.  In that case, Chromebooks are probably the most promising means of achieving a "Year of the Linux Desktop" (aside from Steam Machines, despite them not really counting as "desktops" either).
I agree that including tablets and phones there is a stretch, though (at least until we get the ability to dock such devices into desktop or laptop docking stations *and* they provide desktop-oriented software for such a use case).
I personally find the "Year of the Linux Desktop" to be a rather quaint notion; it was a dream conceived before there was any perceptible hope of Linux coming to dominate literally every other field (except for *maybe* embedded, where VxWorks and non-OS custom software still have large followings).

The "old rich white men" also tend to be involved in funding charities, either out of the goodness of their hearts or in order to get tax deductions (see also: Bill Gates), so showing Bitcoin in a positive light in an environment they frequent would make it that much more likely for them to recommend accepting Bitcoin donations directly for things like, say, fighting malaria.

From the [Jargon File](


In the context of Bitcoin (or cryptocurrencies in general), "FUD" would be described as anything which intends to install "fear, uncertainty, or doubt" in Bitcoin, usually to dissuade people from using Bitcoin and instead only use government-authorized money (like dollars).
Lately, it's also been leveraged between cryptocurrency communities, with users of some cryptocurrency or other leveraging FUD-like tactics in order to promote their own preferred currency over others by making the others appear inferior or flawed.
It's worth noting that there's a difference between FUD and reasoned criticism.  While that difference is acute at times, the latter is vital for any healthy community, since those criticisms can be properly addressed.  It becomes FUD when the point of those criticisms are to attack something rather than make it better, and/or when the criticisms are based on incorrect and/or misleading information/claims.
It's also worth noting that the above point is often lost on some communities, leading to all criticism - regardless of its constructiveness - being regarded as "FUD" and subsequently ignored/attacked.

Ubuntu is an operating system built around Linux.  Linux is a "kernel" (which is the central piece of an operating system).  There are lots of operating systems built around Linux (these tend to be called "distributions" or "distros"), with Ubuntu being among the more popular ones (as well as being pretty easy to use for those new to the world of Linux).


Depends.  No system is secure against an incompetent administrator :)

Right, but 3.5mm jacks - unlike 3.5" floppies - are still actually useful for the majority of people.  An adapter for the former is far more likely to be necessary than an adapter for the latter.
This stands true even during the time period when Apple was phasing out floppy drives.
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:11:56


So what?  It does its job perfectly well:
* It transmits two channels of audio (which is more than plenty for the vast majority of phone situations) and receives one (again, more than plenty for phone situations) in a 3.5mm (or smaller!) form factor that's significantly thinner (albeit longer) than even Lightning
* Not only is it "reversible" (like Lightning or USB Type-C), but the plug can be freely rotated within the port, thus significantly reducing the chance of breakage in real-world use
* Most headphones/headsets using said port don't require an additional power source
* It's already analog, which removes at least one of the two digital-analog conversions required for non-analog audio transmission
* It's universally cross-platform, DRM-free, vendor-lock-in-free, and all the other things that the average Bitcoiner tends to prefer (since those are traits of their presumably-favorite electronic currency)
In other words, if it ain't broke, why fix it?


Again: so what?  Who cares if a phone is a few micrometers thinner?  I'd rather keep the existing thickness (or, better yet, make it thicker) and shove in more battery, since battery life is the single biggest problem with modern smartphones (especially compared to their dumbphone predecessors, which I've seen last for days or even weeks on a single charge; hell, I had one spontaneously wake up and start sounding an alarm after *months* of sitting in a drawer).
If you're going to be condescending toward fans of 3.5mm jacks, you might as well at least *try* to understand where they're coming from and why they're fans in the first place.

I'd be down with switching some of my existing cloud infrastructure over to that if they support either Slackware or openSUSE (or SUSE Enterprise).

That's happening because we're trying to peg Bitcoin to another currency instead of pegging it to goods/services.  In order for the value to stabilize, it needs to see use as an actual currency.

It's a young currency.  Things will fluctuate for awhile.  As its popularity continues to grow for actual purchases (rather than the current trend of latecomers trying to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon as an investment strategy), exchange rates should start to stabilize as its value begins to correlate with those of actual goods and services rather than those of other currencies.

Hence why I'm treating it as a means of spending money electronically instead of an investment strategy; if it happens to look bigger compared to other currencies, then fantastic, but my priority is to be able to send money to anyone in the world for any reason.
All these folks treating Bitcoin as an investment opportunity and panicking over every little dip in the prices are here for the wrong reasons.

Replace CPU/GPU/ASIC mining with offices staffed by row upon row of abacus-wielding minimum-wage-receiving number crunchers, and you might have yourself a post-apocalyptic Bitcoin mining company.
