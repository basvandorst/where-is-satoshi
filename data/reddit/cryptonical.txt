1 min. = 0.0000019025875190259 year.
so 10 minutes (the average block time) is 0.00001902587 of one year.
if the probability of this occurring is 0.002% (as said), 
0.002/0.00001902587 = 105.120028677
so this could happen average once every 3-4 days.
I'm not sure about that.
Maybe my math is bad too.

I hacked NASA, for Bitcoin to go to the Moon.
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:21:37
I think Satoshi Nakamoto is an alias for NSA, 
The hackers know this, and they want NSA to give up the 1 Million BItcoin NSA has control of, in return of their tools.

generate some more address's and change the gap limit. maybe you have an older copy of a used wallet. 
i doubt there will be anything more but worth a shot. sorry to bring your hopes up.
It's worse loading an electrum wallet, especially with the default config. it shows bits for f sake. BITS or mbits. you would have thought there was 10 or 100 bitcoin in there for a moment.
Also minergate can suck it with dashcoin, i thought an old account mined 350 dash for a minute but its actually a generic coin worth 1 cent each.

This is as much about, if not more to do with Blockchain.info, **one of the most widely used Bitcoin wallets** and it's security, than roger ver. 


There is nothing constructive that could come from posting this? nothing interesting about it either? Welcome to "redditor for 5 days".

Funny you say that. i dropped my netbook back in 2010 and a few days later the hard drive started making ticking noises and failed on me.

What happened is undoubtably true.
Your personal opinion matters, but it might be a direct insult to there leadership so it might not be taken well.
It's good to just directly link to this post instead with the np. subdomain. if you link to the votes they will bring without checking the content will be more likely accepted and more of a chance of being down votes. 
Your content could have fit the whole title of a link submission.

Adding multiple coinbase address's is very easy to code into a pool software.
Using multiple ips to broadcast found blocks are also.
Point is, creating multiple identities are very easy no matter what especially for an attacker whom is motivated.

Check this out 
6.5 Bitcoin is ALOT, so take care when downloading/running anything crypto related, ESPECIALLY if it is connected to the internet.
Even if you connect for a few seconds, while remaining offline the whole time a standard malware will distribute the wallet to more experienced hackers and they might get to spend the crypto before ~~you~~ your friend does.
What you could do, download a live usb installer of the latest debian distros.
Won't be perfect, at least you wouldn't be using the hard drive anymore. Plug in another storage device. open disk utility and make a disk image (or open kali linux and do a full forensic backup).
Once you make a good copy of the drive, copy the image file or write it to a nice SSD, will make searching through the data much easier.
If your friend had Windows, it's likely he had some malware that recorded his password, or even web browser sessions or just hidden somewhere in the logs. So this will be useful once day if you don't manage to brute force it.
You can use a tool like  to create a list of possible passwords, this repository has quiet a lot hidden gems.
See this,  you probably know how to run python, or learn it. Ask your friend to add some possible parts of his password, every password he can even think of if he stopped using them, this tool will make a really good wordlist, if you want to spend a few days at this wallet try to build loads of variations. The chance is, your friend didn't create complete random words, which a usual brute force tool will do to crack the wallet. 
i forgot to mention what  does but let me know if you need help.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:39:44
Edit; i forgot to TLDR;
1. Create a custom wordlist with your friends thoughts as entropy.
2. Extract Only the necessary hash to crack the password.
3. Throw it at a powerful tool such as hashcat, or any other and keep the valuable data safe.
@_date: 2015-07-08 04:03:19
You asked how to import the private key to a different wallet.
If you are using Bitcoin-QT you can import the privatekey with 
    importprivkey &lt;bitcoinprivkey&gt;
replace &lt;bitcoinprivkey&gt; with the result from this command executed to export your private key
    dumpprivkey yourbitcoinaddresswithcoinsinit

Somebody posted the password for the email address on Reddit early this year so i tested it out and to my surprise it worked!
Figured someone would take control of the account before me so i quickly changed all the details including the recovery email and password, then proceeded to make this post on Reddit;
Theymos and some others confirmed on this topic that i had control of this email.
I held onto it for a few months until GMX it stopped working so i sent them an email saying:


And their response was:


















As i insisted to get access to the account back (sorry couldn't help but keep a unique piece of history until satoshi himself contacted me to claim it back *dreaming yeah i know lol*), they finally responded with 






















and i never heard anything back from them again.
As to what was in the emails, there was nothing dated prior october 2014 as far as i could remember. My suspicion is the email address expired and someone registered it right away and messed around with it including recovering accounts on various forums and being responsible for the famous "I am not Dorian Nakamoto.".
I spoke to Andreas M. Antonopoulos about it in person a few weeks ago in a Bitcoin meetup and he mentioned Gavin had contacted GMX to have it closed, so that explains why GMX took this action. I hope this sums it up for you.

The person who sent the message 'I'm not Dorian', was infact a troll. 
Here is some details i posted on reddit a few months back about the incident where i got hold of satoshi's email after the "hacker" gave away access to it.

Just FYI (Sorry to add to any conspiracy):
I used to control the satoshin address after recovering it from the "hacker.", proof is here:

I explained talking to Andreas about me losing the email account access.


What's interesting is how Gavin contacted GMX to get the email account closed. I was just holding onto it and never used it for any malicious behaviour (if you don't count checking interesting emails from university students responding to satoshi's whitepaper). Why did GMX listen to him? while it's understandable GMX has the right the close any email without explanation, i pleaded a few times for an explanation but the security department of gmx refused to comment.

I think the "hacker", basically registered the email address after he noticed it was available. Just a theory as some email providers are known to recycle old/unused email addresses by deleting them. Explains why there were no archive of emails.

It's interesting even if a "ponzi", Bitcoin has apparently been one since it was 1 cent.  i don't understand the fundamentals of how or when people get paid steem on steemit... One submission got over $15,000 last i checked?
Are these paid out slowly or right away?
Could not sign up either.  But the price seems quiet high on  and buy support is increasing and few dozen bitcoin away from doubling in value. Not surprised as ETH has over 9000 (lol) Bitcoin on the buy support and nothing is putting users off. ETH also seems to have less, currently globally usable features than this crypto.
