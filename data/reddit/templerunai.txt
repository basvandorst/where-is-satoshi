Nice work, looks great.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:43:02
I can build that in less than 3 hours for What say?

Quick Question: All items are available to ship internationally?
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:25:38
Good guy 8gxe! :)
@_date: 2014-10-26 11:52:52
Yes. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 09:23:30
ChangeTip is awesome. Here's what more would be nice.
1. Make it accept daily use words like "half", "1/3" etc. 
2. Open-Source the bot? We'll make forks and pulls.
3. Live stats, please?
4. Hosted tips? Like "pay to view" types, paywalls?
5. ..and lastly, **Thank you**.
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:28:52
Link it, serves significance. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:44:39
My vote for what said, but *bitcoin only page* ONLY. No need of Indiegogo and it's fees. is anyways always against high fees. :P
Let's keep it 1-to-1, no middle-man. Could host it on fund.buckysroom.org or something like that? What say?
PS: I can build that for you, pretty quick. ;)
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:45:24
I code all week, and then relax with my parents on weekends. Happy weekends to you!
(Automate the tips ;))
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:28:37
Cool! We finally reached this mark! Celebrate!
@_date: 2014-03-31 09:54:59
What is this doing in a Bitcoin SubReddit?
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:53:06
Wow! Too much gold in one thread. I'll take it! :D ;)
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:11:02
So, the debate is on that it **might** grow up?
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:20:12
1. But that happens only if the block size actually increases to that number? (And not just the limit)
2. How is block size related to fees and all? (Sorry, but I'm asking because I have no idea about it)
3. Blocks use equal processing power regardless of their size?
4. Okay.
5. Miners can set block size UNDER the cap, so what's the problem? Block size is determined by the transactions within it or the miner mining it?
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:18:52
Exactly. We should have Bitcoin symbol there now.
@_date: 2014-10-26 11:49:59
I get it?
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:41:05
I agree, I too think that the block limit should be set one time to a high enough value to give time for other systems to come forward. Lightning Network seems good to me.
The small transactions could happen on the new systems instead of directly linking the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:46:54
Okay, I'm kinda getting it.
1. So, the debate is about that it might happen? And people don't want that might to happen with 20MB block because of size.
2. I get it now.
3. Ok.
4. But if the max block size if higher, it will become far more difficult to fill it, so it's a plus in this case, right?
About the altcoins, I think the selection of block size if because they don't think there will be enough volume on transactions. Litecoin already upped the block size to 4MB since there might be that requirements. Though, it's still unknown what will happen in the future.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:10:41
Not exactly, increasing the LIMIT of blocks to 20MB will NOT increase the block size to 20MB. It'll still take plenty of years for that to happen. The block size would still remain ~0.6MB even if the LIMIT is 20MB.
@_date: 2014-05-08 07:36:11
Is this real?
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:15:41
Okay, but if that happens, the current 1MB block limit will basically break Bitcoin, no? Or, if we switch block size to 20MB now and an exponential growth happens, we'll have to do another hard-fork, right? It will be similar situation IMO. Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:14:29
Maybe can shed some light..
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:09:43
Just tagging here. @_date: 2015-07-04 19:13:45


I laughed, lol.
I knew about the redirect, but I think it was all temporary. They should have been in some talks (legally maybe) to do the rightful.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:16:24
Same. I don't think that r/Bitcoin got to know about what happened next (if something happened).
We were all too busy with the blockchain debate.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:04:16
Wish it climbs back to $450.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:20:11
My investment just halved with no transaction. This is disappointing. :/
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:20:28
I have a few questions.
* How does this work? 
* Which "third-party" is generating the card numbers?
* Is there any possibility to get a card number along with the CVV and stuff to pay online using the same wallet?
@_date: 2015-04-09 07:57:43
Would love to see  happening, PayPass/NFC machines are not available in my country and having a possibility of creating virtual cards with Bitcoin will be a big go for me and many others!
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:05:04
I would surely get excited if it doubled, but I didn't really expect it to half so quickly.
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:43:44
Reply please?
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:13:20
I am sorry, I should have specified. The system goes online once a week, just to update balances and nothing else.
@_date: 2013-08-27 15:02:13
What if you want to get all funds into one place? or you wanna make a private payment gateway? or maybe use a service that is once per address (some faucets ;) )?
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:23:09
Thanks! :D

Sure! ;)

Damn. You are rich! Enjoy! Try Gambling! ;)
I am jealous, very.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:13:24
I'll still prefer Gyft since it gives me a Amazon GC and I can use it for whatever I want, in whatever way I want. That too, instantly.
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:14:56
Well, it's a Nexus. Nothing can beat it! 8)
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:07:16
Well, nice idea. But, I don't know if Amazon will ship Nexus 5 to my country.  Let me check. :D
