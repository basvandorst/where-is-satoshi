The reciever doesn't have to be one hop away, but they still need to be on the lightning network, plus the channel still needs to be funded. You COULD lock all your wealth up in a LN channel, but then your  wealth is all locked up in an LN channel. What if you want to pay someone who does not have a channel open?
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:27:24
Yeah... it mentions the exact issues I have with LN. It calls them tradeoffs, not misunderstandings.
@_date: 2016-04-14 05:04:36
That doesn't address my concerns at all. I never said it couldn't find a route from my wallet to someone elses. The problem is, that person has to be on the LN too, and I have to have a funded, open channel in order to even start sending money (ie. the speed tradeoff). This leads me to believe the majority users won't enjoy any upsides by using it, while still dealing with the downsides.
I think it will work great for exchanges/payment processors/banks/etc, but if you want to "be your own bank," it's kind of useless. At least with the use cases I've currently seen. Also, the idea of trusting your funds with a third party institution kind of goes against the whole cryptocurrency ethos, but I digress.
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:43:16
I've never really understood the appeal of LN because of this. As far as I can tell, LN is really only useful for the average person if they're currently someone who stores a majority of their wealth in a Walmart gift card. Sure, LN is decentralized, but if I want to conveniently make a quick payment I have to have a funded channel. That's silly.

If consumers don't care about the amount of time it takes for merchants to get their money, why would they care about confirmation times? If merchants are are willing to to accept the risk of consumers having the ability to reverse transactions, why wouldn't they be willing to accept the slight risk that comes with 0 confirmation transactions? If they are also willing to wait days to use their money, why wouldn't they be willing to wait hours?

You think increasing the block-size is bad, authoritarian design, but you don't think synthetically *creating* a fee market via the block-size is? Fee markets will develop on their own as adoption increases, and miners set there own soft limits on block-sizes/fees. *That* would be a free market. What you're describing is, categorically, not a free market.
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:20:06


Is this not an ideological issue though? I'm pretty sure you're right, people want decentralization in general, but different opinions have been given on *how* decentralized it needs be. Some people believe that every person with an internet connection, even if that connection is well below average speeds, should be able to mine/run a node. Others seem okay if some individuals are unable.
Is decentralization more desirable than Bitcoin's other desirable traits? Are they all equal? A smaller block-size will also lead to higher fees, which is not desirable. There's likely a set of workable solutions that favor decentralization over fees, and vice versa. That's what I'm trying to say in my original post.
Everything else you said in your post is fine, but it doesn't change the ideological nature of the debate. Sure, the market will decide on a workable solution, but the solution might change the definition of what Bitcoin, fundamentally, *is*.
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:17:31

@_date: 2015-06-30 18:21:08
I disagree that centralization is a bigger concern, at least at the moment. Right now, adoption adoption should be the biggest concern, and smaller block sizes discourage adoption due to the increase in fees. Plus, since adoption will increase the number of transaction, the amount of Bitcoin earned from fees will increase as well. Bigger blocks are win-win.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:03:59
Why do you think it's so easy to double spend a 0 confirmation transaction? Any attempt to double spend has the double spender risking his funds. It's never a sure thing, but instead comes down to which transaction is included in the next block. The attacker can take steps to increase the chance of the double spend to be included, but the merchant can also take steps to increase the chance of recognizing the possibility of the attack happening. For example, they could score transactions based on a few factors, like how many nodes have verified/rejected that transaction, and decide from there what they would like to do.
It doesn't need to be impossible to do, it just needs to be impractical.
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:24:39
I'm not saying that it's *only* ideological, but it is a big part of it. Of course there's more to it than that, and there have been plenty of valid technical objections to many of the current proposals.

So this discussion is devolving, once again, into an ideological debate. Nothing is "wrong" with what you're describing, but it's based on what you see Bitcoin as. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:26:58
As far as I know, the miners just accept inputs, and then hash them to produce an output. I don't think they care about the block size.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:28:31
Because, if they don't process transactions, then the network is useless and their coins are worth nothing.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:52:06
This question gets asked a lot, but I suppose it's good that people looking in to Bitcoin ask it.
Miners do not have to include your transaction in the block they are mining. If you want to make sure they include your transaction, it's good to include a small amount of bitcoin as a payment to them. Most wallets do this automatically. In the future, as adoption increases, the hope is that fees will be enough incentive for miners to continue mining.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:12:46
Mining difficulty isn't determined by transaction volume. It's determined by how quickly miners are finding blocks (ie. average block time &gt; 10 minutes, decrease the difficulty. Average blocktime &lt; 10 minutes, increase the difficulty).
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:23:06
The existence of a blockchain for recording transactions is the reason 0-confirmation can be fine. When an attacker attempts a double spend, he's just creating a race between the legit transaction, and his double spend. There is no guarantee that the double spend will be the transaction included.
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:14:34
This is incorrect. Of course there is a chance of a customer attempting a double spend, but steps can be taken by the merchant to make the attack infeasable. RBF alone is bad for Bitcoin. FSS-RBF, on the other hand, is fine since transactions can only be replaced if the outputs are the same.

Does this mean the absolute largest the block size can ever be is 32MB? (Unless we fork again in the future)
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:21:42
It may take slightly longer to verify that a newly found block is correct, which would maybe be a problem if a block was absolutely massive, but creating the block shouldn't. Currently, there is a hard limit on the size of each block (1MB), and there is a debate happening regarding increasing that limit.
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:40:03
Which is perfectly reasonable because not everyone should need, or want, to have the non-trivial understanding required to properly secure their funds themselves.

@_date: 2015-06-29 14:55:57
Yes, but the merchant can take steps to detect the double spend, and act accordingly, since it will be announced *publicly* to the network. This is similar to giving a merchant a fake 100 dollar bill and them giving it a quick look to make sure it's real.

Sorry, you're right that it's not seriously being proposed, but given the state of the debate, I think it would be silly to exclude an unchanged block-size from the possibilities.


That's fine that there are proposals that deal with more than the block-size, but that doesn't change the fact that ideologies are involved in whatever that proposal is, and the block-size will be affected. For example, a solution could be to allow miners vote on the block-size limit. This shifts power over the network towards the miners. Miners will vote for block-sizes that benefit them the most, because why *wouldn't* they. Solutions that shift power towards one participating group in the network will certainly change what Bitcoin is.


Hard forks are scary, sure. Personally, I would prefer them to doing nothing. I'm not opposed to soft fork solutions, but where are they?
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:22:41
Why would miners vote to increase the block size when they make more bitcoin from transactions when blocks are full. Would a block size that changes based on transaction volume not be better?
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:55:38
New transactions must continue to be processed or else the network is useless. Those who own bitcoin through confirmed transactions would not be able to spend them if miners decided to only create 0 transaction blocks. Zero transaction blocks only help the network if there are enough miners continuing to process new transactions. There's also not really any reason to process a zero transaction block since you recieve fees for including them. Even if the fees are small in comparison to the reward, they're still better than recieving no fees at all. Plus, bigger blocks take longer to verify, so you gain a small advantage, time wise, on other miners. That is assuming they continue working on the previous block while they verify your solution.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:07:18
It's only charity if you don't own any bitcoin, though. If you own it, it's in your best interest to support the network. You can do so by running a node. Nothing selfless about it.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:20:47


I am doing a little assuming here, but you think the fee market would be fixed with a block-size cap determined by miners. Miners voting through some sort of consensus network. Miners governing the way the Bitcoin network works. How is this different than any other governing body that is able to affect the prices in the market.
@_date: 2015-06-20 04:37:28
I absolutely agree. We shouldn't give miners the ability to extort wealth from us via the limitations of Bitcoin. Instead, we should worry about making sure adoption increases to the point where miners can profit from small fees paid from a larger volume of transactions. We need to increase the blocksize for this to happen. A fee market is okay, but it's extremely important for individual fees to remain low.
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:00:02

Would the standard of living really rise for the poor though? I don't really know. Is it not possible that people, and corporations, could find ways to funnel the wealth generated from these new sources of productivity into their own pockets instead of distributing it?


Why would we have implemented social security programs in the first place if what we were doing before was working? Maybe not all implemented programs have been effective, but something was clearly wrong with the current system at that time.


The service the government provides is the allocation of pooled resources for creating things like infrastructure and legislation over a given area. By optional tax, I simply mean giving each individual the choice to contribute to the pool (which would, in my opinion, not be a good idea). The difference between the government providing this service, and any other business, is that we at least have some say over how the resources are distributed. A corporation, that always has profit in mind, would not adequately do this job.


I'm sorry, I don't fully understand limited liability, but why would it prevent corporations from being untrustworthy. Is it just because those participating/funding the corporations would not be protected by it?

The problem with statements like this is that they are based on an arrogant attempt to simplify human behavior. If everyone was logical and ethical to a T, then I'd probably be in favor of removing governing institutions, but in reality, we can't even agree on what *is* logical, or what *is* ethical.
I have some questions for you.
1. Do you think the amount of money put into charitable social security programs will be greater than that of governmental programs if we were to remove the governmental programs completely?
2. What do we do if the charitable programs turn out to be inadequate at supplying social security?
3. If taxes were made optional, do you think the amount of taxes paid would increase, or decrease (or stay the same)?
4. If it decreases, do you trust the government to cut funding in the "correct" areas if it needs to?
5. If it decreases, and the government has previously been dismantled, do you trust corporations (who would now be the ones providing the country's infrastructure / healthcare / education etc.) to stay competitive, and not collude with each other to increase their own wealth, or push their own agendas?
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:57:14
I guess the idea is that the selfish miner gets a head-start on solving the next blocks. Potentially, it could continue mining on the secret chain for X blocks, and then publish the entire chain. If it's longer than the public chain the rest of the network was working on, the public chain will be discarded and the selfish miner will collect all the rewards. Intuitively, I don't think it poses much threat, since the rest of the network stands a pretty good chance of catching up to this one miner.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:59:59

This is why a solution like UBI is better than raising the minimum wage.

This also frees up individuals to pursue more risky/creative/fulfilling careers, or take time to improve themselves via college/university etcetera.

My problem with this explanation is it doesn't mention the fact that any funds added to the payment channel must be committed to the blockchain. To me, this means this isn't really useful to the average consumer since it's only beneficial if the participating parties regularly send funds back and forth to each other. I can't recall any recent purchases I've made where the other party would ever send money back to me, unless I asked for a refund on an item I was returning. 
Any situation where transactions mostly move in one direction loses the advantages of a payment channel.
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:49:46

@_date: 2015-05-04 23:41:18
So all funds added to the channel are committed to the blockchain even after the channel is open. Does this mean payment channels are really only useful for parties that frequently send funds back and forth? For example, if I'm only ever going to send funds to someone, like a merchant, it would not make sense for me to open a payment channel with them, correct?

What's your definition of investment? It's definitely something someone can put money into, expecting a return. I would say it's definitely risky, and greatly affected by speculation, but do you think that it's impossible for it to grow out of that?
I would argue that it does have inherent value, but even if it doesn't, what inherent value does gold have? Why is the market cap of gold ~7 trillion dollars?

I guess by real you mean you can hold it in your hand? If you think that provides value then I can't argue against that. There are lots of worthless physical things though, so it's definitely not enough.
Bitcoin is 100% finite unless enough people agreed that it should not be. Value retention is a pretty big incentive to not change that, but maybe there will be mutually a beneficial reason to do so in the future. It would need to be beneficial to a majority of the network participants though.
It could also be an alternative to gold, but you'll disagree due to there not being a physical representation. It also may not provide value to you, living in a developed nation, as an alternative currency, but it does for those in underdeveloped nations.

I'm suggesting a compromise since I realize that there are complex incentives at play here, and that there might be a problem with simply having the network control the size. I also prefer BIP 101 to any of the other current proposals because:
1. It isn't too conservative
2. It doesn't give miners voting power over the blocksize like BIP 100 does

Again, I recommend learning more about the technology. It has a lot more uses than just being a currency. For example, bitcoins could just end up being valuable tokens used to reward miners for securing an immutable ledger, that in and of itself is very valuable to society.
As for what caused the rise to 1000 and the subsequent descent, I'm not sure. Probably lots of different things.

What about decentralized currency makes it sound similar to passive income? Holding bitcoin is like holding gold. There's no passive income involved.


What level of explanation are you looking for? There are explanations ranging from simply what you can do with it, all the way to exactly how everything works under the hood. I would recommend watching this video: 


Do you mean you can't touch it? I've heard this argument a lot. Some governments are pushing towards a cashless society, at which point the money in your bank would no longer be tangible. Is that not okay with you? OR do you mean it isn't "real." If that's the case I would disagree. It's definitely tangible.


There have been incidents where bitcoin was stolen. These were not caused by issues with the underlying network. This is a new technology though, and I can understand your fears. What I think could maybe put you at ease, would be learning more about how Bitcoin, and blockchains in general, work. I think once you did, it would be more clear as to what you could do to not have your bitcoin taken away. I personally hope that in the future there are more options where users do not have to take on the responsibilities their bank would, but at the moment, most people will recommend you do. You will hear people say not to keep your bitcoin in an exchange, or any other centralized service for storing them. That's probably sound advice for now, but you do need to have a decent understanding of the technology.


Hardware wallets cost money, but there are plenty of free, reputable software wallets that will do the job for you if you just want to try it out. Solutions to fees, as well as the underlying issue of scalability, are currently being worked on. The general idea is to move small transactions "off-chain." You can currently send millions of dollars for 20 cents though. That's not bad.


If you want 1 bitcoin, yeah, but you could also pay 9 dollars for 0.001. You don't have to buy a full bitcoin.


These are actually not vague, with possibly the exception of mining. Node is just a term for a device in the network. This is not unique to Bitcoin or blockchains. Universal just means it's not limited to a specific location. I can use this in Canada, the United States, China, Russia, Zimbabwe, or anywhere else as long as I have an internet connection. The word Mining was used simply because the underlying process results in the creation of some new bitcoin. This was thought to be similar to mining for gold.
I understand your skepticism, but I'm hoping it's a healthy amount. I get that it can be confusing, but there are good resources out there for learning about it. I really do think that if you did, you wouldn't see it as a scam.

Well it wouldn't be inflation. No (more) new money is being created.
Would prices go up? That's more difficult to answer. People who had no or very little spending power will have more, but will that actually create more demand for consumables? Those in need do already receive food stamps, and use them. I don't know that demand changes simply because they receive money instead. Luxury goods on the other hand may be a different story, but automation intuitively should keep the price down as well I would think.

And I mean really? What data do you think isn't there exactly? Do you not think we've collected enough samples of temperatures around the world over the years to say that temperatures are rising? Do you think that we can't look at this data and see that temperatures seem to be increasing a lot faster than they have in the past, putting us in a position of a likely cause of the increase? Have we not studied enough environments experiencing drought to understand the effects of less rain in lands we harvest crops from will be? What data do you feel we're missing that prevents us from making claims like "things will be worse."

It depends on the risk the merchant and/or payment processor is willing to take. Zero-confirmation transactions are unsafe, and are likely to get a lot more unsafe in the near future, as it appears a rule called replace by fee is going to be implemented by most miners. Replace by fee will allow you to re-spend unconfirmed transactions by increasing their fee. There are benefits to this, but the draw back is, of course, that the risk of accepting zero-conf goes through the roof.
@_date: 2015-07-08 23:04:32
Yeah, we disagree on what widespread consensus means. I would think that once 75% of the nodes are running a forking version of Bitcoin, that the rest would logically follow suit. It is, after all, a lot easier for the remaining 25% to move than for the 75% to switch back. Maybe I'm wrong. What would you do if XT gets a super majority? Are you going to stick it out with the minority to the bitter end?
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:49:09
They aren't really created. Since everything is digital, the miner simply claims that 25 more bitcoins exist at a specified address. The rest of the network checks to see if the block is good, and if it is, they agree with the miner that they exist.
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:48:46
Unfortunately, a fork is a pretty big deal, and "just trying it" really isn't an option. In fact, one of the reasons people are against increasing the block size, is that it would cause a fork. That said, I'm personally okay with a fork led by a super majority. Others think a super majority still isn't enough, and would require complete consensus to consider a fork.
I should be more clear, just trying it isn't an option on the actual Bitcoin network, but it is an option on the Bitcoin testnet, which is just a version of Bitcoin with intentionally worthless tokens for the purpose of testing these sorts of things.
Another reason many people are against currently proposed block size increases, is that they believe everyone should be able to run a node, if the so choose, regardless of the hardware they have. Increasing the block size adds to the resources required to run a node, and will therefore force some people out of contributing to the network. A side effect of people no longer being able to run nodes, is increased centralization, which could be bad for Bitcoin.
There are probably other reasons as well, but I think those are the main ones. I am of the belief that not *everyone* needs to be able to run a node, and that it is more important that Bitcoin be scalable. Those against current block size increase proposals would argue that Bitcoin can be scaled in other ways, eg. the Lightning Network.
Problems that I see with other scaling solutions:
1. They don't exist (yet).
2. They generally involve increasing centralization in some way.
3. They still require some sort of increase to the block size  to actually be functional long term.
I'm probably missing a lot of things, but I think that's the gist of it. It should be noted that everyone sort of agrees that the block size needs to be increased, and the disagreement is really on how soon/how much/how often.

Because its history is the same as "old" Bitcoin's, they just diverged at some point.

I think calling the fork an "altcoin" is sort of stretching the definition, but I digress. 
Mike only has control over that specific implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. Anyone can create their own implementation that adheres to the *correct* rules, and can change the rules at their own discretion causing a fork. The Bitcoin network is based on consensus. If people don't want to use Mike's implementation, then they won't. He has no control over that. Ultimately, we are the ones with the power.

Does it being useless for you mean it isn't the future? I suspect it probably is "useless" to you at the moment. Some questions you can answer yourself to determine if it's useful for you could be:
- Do capital controls make you angry?
- Do you dislike giving out credit card information when paying for things online?
- Do you often send money to people in other countries?
- Do you run a business, and dislike high credit card/PayPal fees?
If you answer affirmatively to any of those questions, then Bitcoin may be useful to you. At the moment, using Bitcoin as a currency is a little difficult due to lack of adoption from merchants.
I would recommend learning about the underlying technology before purchasing. If, after you understand it, you still think it's worthwhile to own, then buy it.

@_date: 2017-09-18 04:17:19
When a block is created, the miner runs the contents through a hash function. The hash function produces a hash, which is really just a number. Hashing is an easy thing to do, but we don't want blocks to be easy to create, so we say that the number produced by the hash function must be less than another number called the target. The difficulty is just a different representation of the target.
As I'm sure you know, 1 block is supposed to be generated every ~10 minutes. When the hashrate goes up, the average time it take to create a block goes down. We want to maintain blocks being generated every 10 minutes, so if the average time to create a block goes down, we decrease the target. Decreasing the target increases the difficulty.
As the hashrate goes up, so does the difficulty.

@_date: 2015-09-10 16:12:04


Because it's not convenient. Your example still proves my point. People often choose not to use cash due to the inconvenience of needing the cash on you. Also, you can't say having a job is equivalent adding funds to a payment channel. A job is required to have money at all, and is not really part of the issue. 
Hitting your credit limit is sort of the same issue, as you have to add funds back to it, but credit accounts are convenient for other reasons (like being able to spend money you don't already have). Emptying your bank account is not at all the same issue, as there's no extra step after being paid to that account, or depositing a cheque.
A bank account is simple, your employer pays to it, you spend from it. You *can* have different accounts for different things, but usually they are meant specifically for saving in some way, not for spending. If you have multiple, non-credit, accounts for spending, then you are likely an edge case with uncommon reasons for having things setup that way. Most people have a chequing account and a few savings accounts.


I don't see why many people, or businesses, would want to be hubs.


Bitcoin does this already.

You wouldn't anymore than you do now. One of the benefits of the lightning network is that you don't have to worry about fees. They should actually increase when using the network itself.

If bitcoin succeeds in a way that average people *are* using it, then they will know that they are paying people in bitcoin. What they won't know, is how it works, whether that be off-chain or not.
They *will* know they are using it, though.
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:52:16
We do want it, but in my opinion we don't **WANT** it.
The thing is, a transaction has to be broadcast to fund a payment channel in the lightning network before anything can happen. So what does this mean? Well, it really just means it's less useful/convenient for average users.
You can think of a payment channel as one of those re-loadable gift cards you buy for distant family members because you don't know what to get them for their birthdays. The card can be used to pay for things much quicker than other methods of payment, since it's just the company updating the balance on the card. They can also refund money to the card just as easily.
So why aren't we all using gift cards to pay for things? Well, for a couple reasons.
1. Think about what happens when you run out of money on the gift card. You have to use another form of payment to fund it again (ie. post a transaction to the blockchain).
2. The card is only good at one place (ie. one payment channel), meaning more than one card is required if you want to buy things from multiple stores.
The lightning network *sort of* fixes number two by allowing transactions to span multiple payment channels to get where they are going. Essentially your money can hop from Alice, to Bob, then Charlie. The problem still being that there has to be a route from Alice to Charlie, lest she have to create a new payment channel specifically for Charlie.
The lightning network is bad for people who just want to conveniently transfer value with no middlemen. What it would be good for, is optimizing the current banking system, which already operates in a hub and spoke like nature, with payment channels setup between clients accounts, and other institutions.
Make no mistake, the lightning network is cool. It's just not **COOL**.

What do you mean by actual money? It just creates a digital token that people assign value to. Since people believe the token has value, it can be exchanged for other valuable tokens/items/services.
**Math problem**:
Suppose you have a machine takes in a number (input) and turns it into a different number (output). Also, suppose that the only way to know what the output will be, is to actually run the input through the machine. You can't guess the output based only on the input alone.
The math problem miners are solving is just running this machine over and over again with different inputs until they get an output that is less than some pre-determined value.
It secures the blockchain. The miners solve this problem for each block, and the ouput of the machine for one block is added to the input of the next, linking them to each other in a way that can't be undone without solving the problem again.

If someone steals your physical wallet, they get access to whatever you have in there. Debit cards, credit cards etc..

@_date: 2015-10-07 22:34:25
Depends how much of an understanding you need to be able to trust it. Consider this, how much do you understand our current banking system? You know swiping your debit card and entering your pin moves money from your account to some other account, but do you know what actually takes place to make that happen?
People trust Bitcoin because, one, the network prevents you from spending what you don't have, and two, transactions are essentially irreversible once they've been processed. I can go into further detail if you'd like, but knowing how much detail you'd like is the problem.
