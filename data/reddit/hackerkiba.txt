They probably never planned the attack, but did they benefit from it? Yes.
But is it good for the American empire? Probably not. We lost a lot of blood and treasure in the process.

It's probably because you need a username to join one of those mining pool. I don't mine so I don't know anything about bitcoin mining.
I prefer to earn my bitcoin the hard way.

We have a tendency to think that we can find a relationship between the price of bitcoin and events that happen to coincide with the price drop or rise.

This thread is useful in some way even if valve never accepts bitcoin. It raise awareness of bitcoin.
On the other hand, engagement effort would be better spent on convincing other vendors or communities that will readily accept bitcoin.

Once I understood the fundamentals of bitcoin, I decided I am going to just sit on my coin and see what happen. I don't even try to reason about why the price of bitcoin go up and down.
Sure, it's a risky bet and all, but I want bitcoin to succeed.

Yes, I know this is a big problem. It's on my mental TODO list.  Meanwhile, I suggest you to use this as a guide: 
If you have trouble getting to the game mode itself, click on the screen to get focus and navigate with W-S and press return/enter to select an option. I should have it autofocus on the game in the future so that people don't have click it to do anything first.

There is no need to go to wordpress if I need to buy a theme. 
Most of all, I homebrew the CMS system to fit specifically the needs of bitcoinweekly.com. It doesn't have a lot of features and it doesn't need to have these features. The features that it does have improve the writing process, such as the review system which is beginning to free me from the editorship role and improve the quality and the speed of the process.
The theme is stark, yes. Some people like it. Some people don't. I have not gotten  enough overwhelming hate mail to make me change my mind.

This means Bitcoin Weekly can continues the mission of becoming the cultural powerhouse of the bitcoin world.
