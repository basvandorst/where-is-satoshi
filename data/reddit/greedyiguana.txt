i seriously want to believe that "m" was a typo

haha i wish I was trolling.  i haven't read the white paper at all actually, so its my fault for not understanding it.  I've been a lazy miner.  however people do seem pretty up in arms over a couple of questions

Is this referencing buying into bitcoin with cash, the increased electricity costs of mining, or investing in better hardware?  Or all three?  Just curious if it was one that stands out as being the expensive part of "free".
So far I only have suffered increased electricity, but then again I also only have like a third of a bitcoin

but in order for a transaction to be valid you have to have bitcoins.  I know that they don't actually exist but a bitcoin value, tied to an address exists somewhere.  So if you have a wallet.dat file and you spend all the bitcoins on it but then you upload an older version to the same computer (or another computer), what's to stop you from respending those bitcoins.  A wallet.dat file should (in my mind) prove that a certain address is capable of a transaction of so many bitcoins.

this worries me as well.  i use mybitcoin because I want a bitcoin wallet I don't have to worry about crashing with, but if things like this keep happening it might be better to use the desktop client and just manually back up the wallet.dat file.
my problem is that I feel like I should know more about how the desktop client works before using that exclusively.  I don't like the idea that it is tied to one computer necessarily.  is it really just the wallet file that I need to copy that info over to other computers?  If I copy the wallet.dat file to like eight different computers, obviously that doesn't increase the amount of bitcoins, but why not exactly?  I just have a ton of questions and no time to reseach them haha

nope, two 4850's and a 6970.  I just started though
@_date: 2011-07-21 17:18:35
yeah it makes sense it just blows my mind thinking about it
@_date: 2011-07-11 21:03:40
they actually have helped a bit.  from what i understand here the wallet.dat file just holds your address info and then the actual bitcoin process is what determines how many BTC are associated with each address.  which is why you can't spend BTC from one address, copy the wallet.dat and spend the money again.  some of the finer points still elude me but I'm sure reading the white paper will help

what i want to know is where one gets those drop forged key screwdrivers
@_date: 2011-07-23 04:58:35

@_date: 2011-07-21 21:33:54
