None of those are valid reasons or an explanation/justification of why you know what you're talking about...also, even if you made money on BTC, so did many, many others

Why would anyone look to you to offer suggestions? Had you looked closer into the Google engineer's complete background, you would have found the answer to you ignorant question/statements.

Pay attention to the message (the content) and what's being discussed - not what you think the person's credentials might be. Had you looked more closely, you would know what I'm talking about.

Dollar-cost averaging is the best way to go. Over an extended period of time, it works really well.

Honestly, the bitcoin whitepaper &amp; how Satoshi intended for BTC to be used can be open to interpretation to a reasonable extent. Security &amp; stability are great and we must have those, but nothing wrong with using BTC as a medium-of-exchange (MoE). The whole argument that it's just supposed to be a store-of-value (SoV)....ok fine but if people also want bitcoin to be a MoE, then so be it! Nobody should be dictating what others should think about anything.
