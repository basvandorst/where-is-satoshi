Uphold is also cheaper, although ACH transfers are currently unavailable since they are upgrading to a new system.  I go to bittybot.co/us/ when I am about to make a purchase to see who has the best price at that time.

That is what I would have thought but it does not square with the chart on bitcoinfees.earn.com.  Either the chart is completely wrong or there is some kind of priority.

Send applications to every exchange that will operate in your state.  In addition the 4 you have already done, you can consider Kraken and Bitfinex.  Bitfinex will not take US individuals anymore but I think they will still take US business accounts.  If I recall, they opened mine in about 1 week after submission and I have not received any correspondence that it is closed now.

What if you only had $1 in the channel.? The current miner fee is that high at current prices and would certainly be true at $1 million per BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:18:58
Segwit can't even get over 35% for more than an hour.  Like it or not, it appears that any scaling change is going to require a compromise with the miners.  Meetings, etc. and that might never work.
Perhaps more effort needs to be made to find second layer solutions that work with bitcoin as it is.  If that were to be possible maybe the status quo would work.  Yes, if you want to have a private key to an actual bitcoin, you have to pay a lot for the transaction but once it's yours it yours.  If the second layer solutions work, then that might be ok.
Right now, the price of bitcoin says the market is ok with the stalemate.

That is not true.  Each share is 0.09350819 BTC.

I would keep them both for quite a while, probably long enough that the loser was worthless.  I'd rather lose out the possible profit of converting them from one to the other due to the risk of picking the wrong chain as the "winner".
@_date: 2016-06-23 04:53:58
I believe with dollar cost averaging, you use a fixed amount of dollars to buy bitcoin at a regular interval, not the other way around.
The example would be:
Use $700 to buy 1 BTC at $700/BTC.
Next week, use another $700 to buy 1.4 BTC at $500/BTC.
That way, you buy more BTC when the price is lower and less BTC when it is higher.

I disagree.  I feel that it is a kind of governance but I think that anarchy is a kind of government.
If I could dream what the best outcome would be, it is that the miners stick together and attempt to enforce the NYA.  This results in the 2x fork.  However, over the next month, it fails because users do not accept it and gradually the hashpower returns to the original chain when it becomes obvious through market pricing that you cannot have a successful hard fork without overwhelming consensus.  That way, everyone will know that it is very very hard to change bitcoin which should prove its worth as the one true cryptocurrency for the long long term.  Otherwise, I worry that Governments will think they can control bitcoin in the future by amassing enough hashing power.
That is a pretty risky dream, I'm afraid it would probably not turn out that way.  I'm hoping the NYA participants choose to stand down. But, unlike you I suspect, I think bitcoin2x can still be successful and worth participating in even if the NYA is successful.

The disbursement rules are the same for any other IRA.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:45:29
I take it your opinion is that it is only a hard fork if it ends up the longest chain?  If not it is just a new altcoin?

Keep both for quite some time. I do not feel smart enough to know which one will "win".

You do not need to invest the money you put in the account in anything specified.  You can leave it as cash, buy bitcoin, buy gold,  buy real estate or most any other investment. It is not limited to just Bitcoin.

I do not know how inherited IRAs work but I do not see why you could not roll it over into something like this.
I opened all those exchange accounts because the verification was taking so long.  One should be enough.
You need an exchange account opened in the name of the LLC you set up to buy the bitcoin.  You cannot use your personal coinbase account to do it.
After you buy the bitcoin, you can transfer it to your trezor.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:15:03
The memo says "US Individuals".  Does this mean that a US business account can stay?

Is Chainalysis able to get any xpub or address information when people connect to [wallet.trezor.io]( with their hardware wallet?  Seems unlikely, I hope.

I don’t remember but I think it’s the agreement the trust prepares about allowing the investment of IRA funds to the LLC

Coinbase finally approved my account on November 1.  Took a very long time.  I’m glad to have a number of exchanges approved so I can pick the best one when it’s time to start withdrawing.  I’m a hodler so that will not be for a while.  I feel very fortunate to have done this early enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:40:26
That’s not true like you think. When bitcoin gets spammed and fees go up the block reward goes up with the fees. At first I thought the hash rate should be proportional to the price but only if there are no significant fees.  It seems this DAA will help bitcoin more than bcash. Aren’t unintended consequences nice.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:23:22
Because of Bcash, people think its an easy way to make extra money from holding at the fork and selling the "dividend".  I think this is helping to push the price up before the fork.  I would expect a short-term drop after the fork as speculators exit their positions on both chains.  Long-term I think a failure of B2X is very good news for HODLers.

He thinks if it gets too successful they will ban it.  Would certainly cause problems for a while but it would be proof it’s worth something.  Banning drugs has been very effective at keeping the cost of drugs down, don’t ya think. The same would happen with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:10:15
Kind of surprised this does not cause a price bump
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:12:28
Right about BCH market before the fork.  ViaBTC market seemed crazy high at 0.2 but was pretty close to where it opened.
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:22:12
Finally. Viabtc was not to far off from initial trading with bcash.  Although at the time it seemed way too optimistic.  Should have a better idea of the short term price at the fork.  Long term not so accurate.
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:56:52
I suspect a number of non-miner signatories to the NYA know that the 2x coin is going to lose and would prefer no fork at this point but they do not want to pull out because they gave their word.  I'm fine with that.  Let's have the fork to prove the point about how hard it is to change bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:44:52
It is better for bitcoin if the fork happens and fails because it proves how hard it is to change the rules.  Backing out means some will think it is still possible.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:23:43
Interesting. Kraken did open my account and I assume it is structured like yours. If you want to get trading sooner I bet itBit will be the fastest.

Broad financial set up the LLC for me.
Your friend will list the LLC as the payee on the check that they write you. Now that the account is open, you will wire your IRA funds and then write a check back to your friend for that amount you borrowed.
You may be able to fund an IRA directly through Broad Financial but I ended up transferring IRA funds over.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:33:43
I believe the yearly fee is on the order of $200, paid $50 per quarter.  You will have to check with them to be sure.  If you deposit more money into the account I think they charge $50 each time.
If you keep the cash in your account, you do not pay any fees.  I think they have a $50 fee to send you a check for a distribution, you need to double check with them on that.
You can buy any cryptocurrency you want.  You are not setting up a "Bitcoin IRA".  You are setting up a fully controlled self-directed IRA.  You can buy pretty much anything you want with it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:12:59
If you already have a personal account with an exchange then you will need to use a different email address when trying to set up the new one.  Be sure to click the box for institutional or business.  I am going to guess that things are crazy at the exchanges due to the new high prices so itBit will be your best bet.  They will actually email you back in a day and answer your questions in a timely manner.
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:13:13
There is no reason to use a hot wallet after you withdraw from the exchange.  You can use a hardware wallet or paper wallet.

It is inevitable that mining will be centralized.  We need to ensure that even if it is centralized, they cannot dictate what happens to bitcoin.  Otherwise, governments could force them to adopt the changes they want.  A world wide central banking crisis could possibly get the US, China, Russia, etc to all agree to do such a thing if they all found bitcoin to be threat.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:31:08
Any account you make has to be in the name of the corporation you set up. Otherwise, they will refuse any wire transfers because the names do not match. Not to mention potential tax problems.
As for accounts, I have them set up and approved with itBit, Bitfinex , Kraken, and Gemini.  Still waiting for approval with Coinbase and Bitstamp.  Not that I need all those accounts, but when I was unable to get approved quickly, I applied to all of them.
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:24:34
I have my bitcoin safely sitting on my Trezor.  I am happy with the service from Broad financial.
As far as opening exchange accounts.  itBit opened mine in 2 days.  Gemini took about 3 weeks.  Kraken took 3 weeks.  Bitfinex took 4 weeks.  Bitstamp still hasn't finished with me after 6 weeks but they have at least acknowledge my presence and asked for some additional documents.  Coinbase/GDAX has not responded to me at all after 6 weeks.  Not that I need all these accounts but it will give you an idea about how long this can take.
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:10:18
Based on my understanding, there is no reason why you would need more than one LLC. You can make any purchases through that as long as they're not prohibited.
@_date: 2016-07-31 22:22:55
I have used Uphold, Coinbase, Circle, and Gemini.
I make relatively small purchases once per week.  HODL.
The cheapest for an instant buy from US bank transfer is Uphold.  This is taking into account transfer fees, purchasing fees, and withdrawl fees.  Effective with changes at various exchanges happening this week, these vary from 0 to 1.49%.  And of course they have different rates for how much they will sell the BTC for which can be significant on its own.  Uphold has a new pricing/withdrawl fee structure starting tomorrow. Coinbase is later in the week.  After that, Uphold will still be the cheapest of the 4 I mentioned when taking everything into account.

This is normal volatility.  Need a much bigger drop or gain to mean anything real is happening.

With the usual caveats about consult your tax consultant, I do not see why alts require any different process or reporting.  In fact, I think a tax advantage account would be a good way to trade alts.  No need to worry about tax issues until you take a cash IRA distribution.
You have to use a different exchange account for the LLC.  It must be completely segregated from any personal account you may have.  The bitcoin cannot mingle in any way.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:41:52
I think you can.  What ever you do, keep a log.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:26:55
I do not believe you need to notify anyone about any trades you make on the exchange.  I believe that once a year, the IRA custodian will ask you for the fair market value of the LLC.  No idea how much detail they want.  I do not know if they need it broken down to x amount of BTC, y amount of ETH, z amount of cash or if they just need the cash value of the holdings.  Some one who has done this for longer than l year will need to clarify that.
I have applied to all 3 exchanges you mention under the name of the LLC.  Still awaiting approval.  I have provided articles of incorporation, tax id, operating agreement, bank account info, personal id and info.  They have all asked for info on the source of funds.  I sent them my original IRA statement as the source.  Truth is, I will probably never make more trades until time to start taking retirement distributions.  Other than the trades necessary to make this transfer, I'm a hodler.
When you open the IRA, they will give you a list of prohibited transactions.  Anything that has your or a family member name on it is prohibited.  In fact when I opened my LLC bank account, I had to have a friend write me a check for $100 to open it.  If I had written a personal check to open it, that would be a prohibited transaction.  After my wire came in, I wrote a check back to my friend.  I think it is technically considered a loan.  You cannot loan yourself money, therefore you cannot loan the account money to open the account.
If you engage in prohibited transactions or mingle, the IRS could consider that you distributed the assets and therefore incur the tax at that time.  If under 59 1/2, you would also pay a 10% tax penalty.  If you abscond with the bitcoin or funds, I assume they just tax you on the amount.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:40:26
Thee LLC was opened in Missouri.  It costs $100 per year to keep up the corporation.  Broad Financial recommended it because it is the cheapest option.
itBit only trades Bitcoin.  I did finally receive approval of my account for Kraken today.  So, I could buy ETH if I wanted.  Currently, I do not plan to invest in alts, but nice to know I could if I wanted.  If you were so inclined, you could open a business account at Poloniex and purchase pretty much any alt you want.
After reading more about IRS treatment of self directed LLCs for IRAs, I think the most important thing to do is be accurate in your reporting because the penalty is draconian.  Any prohibited transactions result in your entire IRA getting immediately distributed, a 15% penalty on the entire balance, and a 10% early withdrawl penalty if under 59 1/2.  Basically, do not try to hide any alt purchases to pretend they did not happen.  If we go to the moon and the IRS thinks you are a gazillionaire, they will probably find it worth a closer look.
I plan to keep a log of everything.
