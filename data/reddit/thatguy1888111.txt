Lets all buy this limited-supply asset and NEVER sell it... then we'll all be rich!!!
Yes. On paper. Its all on paper until you get an even bigger chump to buy from you.

uh.... inflation literally happens because currency is distributed. that is the definition of inflation. 


i understand exactly how bitcoin works (im a blockchain software developer) but thanks for your autistic patronizing
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:49:14
also, re: "these are the tip of ... bitcoin's uses"
you are wrong. 
blockchain is extremely useful, yes. like i said, it is currently what im making my career out of.
bitcoin, no. bitcoin is in a massive bubble right now and the crash is going to be ugly.

-not private
-highest transaction fees
-lowest utility
-slowest confirmation times

You aren't "up 30x" until you cash out.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:37:02
"saturation" is too complicated of a word for you? really? well, case in point...
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:02:20
so in other words, you really only have a vague ultra-idealistic vision of how your "new world" looks- because when asked to nail it down to something, even you understand how ridiculous it sounds. got it.
hope you dont hold too much bitcoin right now, your losses will just continue to mount as the smart money continues to cash in.
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:24:05
you are correct that you need a valuable token reward to incentivize miners. saying that token "will either be bitcoin or not bitcoin" is a somewhat meaningless statement.
some blockchain tech i see coming out anchors to the bitcoin chain, most does not. saying you can't separate blockchain from bitcoin is blatantly false, i dont know who has been telling you that.
i appreciate you asking my opinion, but keep in mind that my job doesn't really afford me any special insider perspective. a non-software developer would be able to tell you the same thing i can.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:07:13
Uh, dont kid yourself. Its inflation. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:24:07
and where is this new found wealth coming from? you surely do not mean to tell me that it comes magically out of thin air?
and this "wealth", how is it realized? meaning, how is it spent and converted into power?
if it is converted into dollar, there must be someone on the other end who loses an equivalent amount of wealth.
if it is not converted into dollar, tell me how it is then realized?
final question- you say that these newfound wealthy individuals will "actualize different ideals"... presumably they would need power to do this, so again, what does that really look like? where does this power come from? where are they drawing this power to enact change from? again, please lets not do ourselves a disservice and pretend that it can come out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:25:01
uh..... im definitely not buying back into this. i did sell around 5500. could have made more, but after seeing all these signs im not getting back in. with more organic growth i would be more comfortable, but these is 10/10 obvious bubble. history always repeats itself, this isn't anything new.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:01:03
is it even worth responding to someone who says shit as stupid as "the US dollar will eventually go to zero"?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:24:05
I use a new account for every subforum I post on so people cant build a profile of me.
people selling house for bitcoin:
 i didn't short, i sold what i owned and now im just posting about the obvious. im not "shitting on" anybody.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:39:07
-widespread media coverage
-people selling houses and cashing out retirement (see people trading houses for tulip bulbs)
-related: buyers over leveraging themselves to the hilt
-skeptics vehemently being told they “just dont get it”
none of this was happening at $8.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:54:15
incorrect...  and anyways not relevant- im posting it now as it applies to bitcoin, not the stock market
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:07:07
i have friends i havent spoken to in months/years texting me asking about bitcoin. its talked about at family gatherings. you have celebrities posting it on their twitter. your assertion that the average person doesnt have a clue about it is most certainly false.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:51:59
good luck with that 
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:16:06
oh look, another sheep.
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:42:08
lmao- you have it exactly wrong. BLOCKCHAIN, not bitcoin, is the “internet” in your analogy. while blockchain technology is certainly here to stay, bitcoin is much more likely to crash to zero than ever hit 15,000 (let alone some of the other ridiculous numbers i see thrown around). 
bitcoin is just one application of blockchain that will get wiped away once the crypto bubble pops, even though blockchain is here to stay. here, let me put it like this...
blockchain:bitcoin :: internet:[random overvalued internet stock that went bankrupt]
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:23:48
(going with your assumption that another major banking crisis is inevitable, which i dont agree with)
and then.... people will pour their money more into shit they cant touch.... like bitcoin. right....
wrong. people will do what they always have done in crashes and crises, which is put buy gold and/or take cash out of the bank.
you are forgetting that during banking crises, the physical cash dollar gets relatively much stronger.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:35:19
except for literally every sign of every bubble in history, NBD
    -new paradigm
    -widespread media coverage
    -extreme valuations
    -overleveraged buyers (people selling their houses, borrowing, etc)
    -surge of "retail investors" - people with no financial experience
    -everybody getting rich (see above)
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:25:31
uh oh, did somebody buy at the top? sad. go cry to someone else.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:12:27
wrong, the value would not effectively be zero, because the US government will always tax residents in USD, and accept no other currency. therefore, the value of the USD will always have value, because it can be used to pay the value-equivalent of whatever tax debt you owe
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:07:59
so a university professor doesnt understand money/economics/finance, but you do?
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:59:12
if you have no income, you cant pay for anything. derp!
and if you have income of any kind, you owe taxes on whatever value you gained in the dollar-equivalent of that value. 
ergo, you will need to convert at least the taxable amount of whatever value you earned into dollar in order to pay taxes, or else you will go to jail. its really very simple.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:39:28
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:10:50
i dont know what you think youre describing, but theres literally no scenario where you aren't either
a) broke or
b) owe taxes.

Five Steps of a Bubble
Minsky identified five stages in a typical credit cycle – displacement, boom, euphoria, profit taking and panic. Although there are various interpretations of the cycle, the general pattern of bubble activity remains fairly consistent.
Displacement: A displacement occurs when **investors get enamored by a new paradigm**, such as an **innovative new technology** or interest rates that are historically low. A classic example of displacement is the decline in the federal funds rate from 6.5% in May, 2000, to 1% in June, 2003. Over this three-year period, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell by 2.5 percentage points to a historic lows of 5.21%, sowing the seeds for the housing bubble.
Boom: Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question **attracts widespread media coverage**. Fear of missing out on what could be an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of participants into the fold.
Euphoria: During this phase,caution is thrown to the wind, as **asset prices skyrocket**. The "greater fool" theory plays out everywhere.
**Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase**. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot, or more than 350-times the value of Manhattan property. After the bubble burst, real estate lost approximately 80% of its inflated value, while stock prices declined by 70%. Similarly, at the height of the internet bubble in March, 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the Nasdaq was higher than the GDP of most nations.

But you wont. And youll continue to "hodl" and become fabulously wealthy in your own mind... someone else who is smarter will likely beat you to the cash out, and youll never ever sell, and you'll almost certainly lose everything, because you refuse to sell no matter what.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:57:50
ok ill bite... and in your new fantasy world where the "poles of power" have been shifted.... who retains power now? what happens to the millionaires and billionaires and the government (who remember, still demands taxes from its citizens in US dollar)?
in your new world, who has "power"? what does this "power" look like?
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:06:20
wrrrrrooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnngggggggg, thanks for outing yourself as someone who knows literally nothing about GDP growth, inflation, money velocity etc. the dollar relative to how many are in circulation is stronger than it ever has been
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:56:32
i mean yeah i do lots of blockchain stuff, just not getting back into bitcoin at this point. its legacy technology, has zero intrinsic value compared to other coins, and full on bubble mania at this point.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:22:18
but ***you*** really get it. ***you*** understand economics, and no one else does, especially not anyone who thinks bitcoin isnt going straight to 100,000.

What is the 'Greater Fool Theory'
The greater fool theory is the theory that states it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether overvalued or not, and later selling them at a profit because there will always be someone (a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay the higher price.
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:18:26
it has the highest value because its in a massive bubble.
there is nothing about bitcoin that is safer, or more secure, or more reliable than [insert top10 altcoin here].
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:38:26
you buy a car with BTC, you are going to have to look back to when you acquired that BTC, calculate what its value was then, calculate its value when you buy the car, and pay taxes on the capital gains you made (if any) from when you acquired the btc to when you are using it to buy the car.
the seller of the car owes taxes on the us dollar equivalent of value/income gained in the sale, payable only in dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:31:23
right, and you have so much of it... having lived through what, exactly zero major bubbles in your lifetime?
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:28:27
"it's amazing the price doesn't 10x every week."
lmao. ok, fine... when the crash comes, just promise not to commit suicide on the way down.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:45:54
hello retard, i work at blockchain company as a software developer and have been personally invested in bitcoin for the last year (until i sold out just recently) 
thanks for your advice though.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:18:54
dude, i get it. everybody in here thinks that "mass adoption" is inevitable, and therefore the price will only keep going up.
what if i told you.... mass adoption ISNT inevitable?
in any rich society (you know, the societies that could really pour billions of dollars into it if they wanted to), bitcoin has no real use case whatsoever. no one is going to switch from visa to bitcoin just because "decentralization", "anti-government!", or whatever other else bullshit.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:21:11
try not to commit suicide for me on the way down, k?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:25:28
uh, no? i invested in bitcoin last year and sold out recently... i didnt become a millionaire, but i made out fine. thanks for your concern though.
im simply pointing out the obvious.. we've never been at such a high saturation of retards investing in bitcoin as we are now. hence obvious bubble is obv.
