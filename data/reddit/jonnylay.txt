lol, I love listening to you people who think the dollar is going to crash any day now. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:56:22


If your house is worth $100k, and there is 3% inflation, then the next year the same house would cost $103k
But with deflation, at the same rate and time frame, the house would cost $97k. 
So, if you had just saved your money, and not bought a house for a year, you would have a higher value of $6000.  


No this means that a bank will make money even if they charged no interest.  They would still make money even if they charged negative 3% interest. Not exactly make money, but still increase their value over time. 
So if they charged 5% interest, they would actually be making 9% interest in value.  
But why would they loan anything out if it didn't return more dollars than what they started with?  They wouldn't, so if you payed 3% interest, and there was 3% deflation, you would pay $215000 on a house that would, after 30 years, only cost $40k
That was a lot of math...Let me know if you need me to explain my steps...
What you described is how it works with inflation.

The problem is Austrians tend to think they are the same thing.  That there is a direct relationship between both kinds of inflation. 
That raising the monetary base will cause prices to go up.  That's why Ron Paul has been screaming like a madman about runaway inflation.  He didn't just mean the rise in the monetary base.

You wouldn't be more frugal if your dollar today would be worth 2 dollars tomorrow?  Hyperbole to prove the point. 
Your lottery example uses someone who spends frivolously as you example of general society.  That's a false dichotomy. 
Can you explain your un/sound investments theory?


So you don't actually have a problem with inflation itself?  Are you abandoning that point?  Can you elaborate?
If QE caused inflation, why is inflation 2% vs the 80 year average of about 6%?


A middle class person and a lower class person in general spends all of their money that they made in a year.  So they are subject to almost none of the effects of inflation.  An upper middle class person that doesn't invest is most susceptible. 


There were a whole lot more poor farm hands than frontiersmen. 
We didn't enter WW2 until 1941 by that point GDP was already up 20%from what it was just before the depression started. We left the gold standard to fight deflation, and massively increased spending.  
Bad loans are a part of what got us in to this. But that does't have anything to do with the fed as much as it does the government regulations. Harding and Coolidge were both rampant deregulators that thought the private banks would control themselves. 
Deflation, when you already have a loan, is not fun.  For example:
On a $100k house, if you payed 3% interest, and there was 3% deflation, you would pay $215000 deflation adjusted value on a house that would, after 30 years, only cost $40k.


Clearly that number isn't adjusted for inflation...that's why in the next sentence I explain that if wages had only grown the same rate of inflation people would be making $1500 less.  But since there was growth, it is actually higher.

Sorry what didn't I address? 
You just changed most of your stances, so it would seem I addressed your initial points.  Or at least pressured you into making actual points. 
Do you think not having inflation will foster more sound investments?  I don't think 1% to 6% inflation is going to push people to throw their money at anyone promising returns.  Research is what brings sound investment. 
Do you want no inflation or do you want deflation?  Or just a free wheeling fixed quantity currency? 
Is inflation to you, in this discussion the value of a currency or the quantity? 
How does inflation transfer wealth to the government and fed? 
Pretty well every businesses carries debt.  Pays some of it's employees with its loans, and uses the loans for research and expansion.  There would be no one to facilitate these loans without a central bank making dollars available.  This would result in much fewer jobs available.  This helps the middle class. 
When was the middle class really created?  Shortly after the depression, right? 
You could argue that it started in the twenties, but that financial system couldn't handle the debt placed on it, which led to the Fed. 
Median income has risen 89% since 1990.  Actually grown slightly more than inflation. (from ssa.gov)  so you are wrong there.  People would make about 1500 less per year if it had only grown at the rate of inflation.

Because it grows the economy.  Inflation isn't an accident.  It is a design.  If you just kept your money because it would grow in value, and never invested then there would be no investors, and there would be little to no job growth or innovation.  
Inflation incites people to invest and spend.  Investing and spending are what grow the economy.

@_date: 2015-07-01 20:53:50


You don't really have to be too knowledgeable to just use tor safely, and it gets easier every day. (and harder, but mostly easier)
Yeah, you can do CLI, but kids today don't need CLI.  A well designed GUI is often faster.  
TOR is GUI, anyone can learn to use it with a couple hours of searching.  You can download the TOR app and just tap an icon and be ready to go. 


Not most ~30 year olds that I know...I think you have a selection bias, for being a ~30 year old, and having tech savvy ~30 year old friends. 
There is certainly some truth to what you say though.  It's like playing a new video game, specifically one in Beta.  If you started playing minecraft today, it could get a little overwhelming.  You'd need to use references to do most things, or use an in game reference.  
But, if you started in Beta, you have all the references memorized, you can string together different mechanics to do cool things, and you know the base game.  But, you ignore some Mods that make everything easier, and cooler for new players, but completely different than what the game started as.

It actually does.  ;)
Not his personal router, but his ISP's router the next level up.  He might be coming from 126 public IP's(Very, very, expensive) but they'd all be going through one router. Or it's possible he has 3 ISP's available. And that would let him triple that, but it would still basically be only 3 IP's that they would have to block.  
Now, he could use multiple VPN's to duplicate this a few times out...but it wouldn't really get you very far.
* **Lab time!**
Google: what is my IP.  This is your public IP address.  This is what websites see you as, this is what you tell people to connect to if you decide to run a server.
Now, open command line.  Type: tracert google.com
This will show you every router(hop) between you and the google servers. All they have to do is block any one of these hops traffic and it will block all DoS attempts.  
If you paid for more than one IP, all they have to do is block one hop out from that.

Only if the ISP is the one that actually kills the connection.  This would take a lot more time than blocking from the victim side.  VPN's would only be viable for the number of VPN's they have available to use.  Maybe 100?  Still, super easy to block 100 compared to +10000 IPs in a botnet.

More like, the price of gas is high this week, I'll take my electric car instead of the hummer.  
With your analogy you are forced to use gas...in this situation there is another and better financial solution.

So you want/expect the governments of the world to relinquish their control of currency?  
Not to mention that the problems of bitcoin would then exist everywhere... 
@_date: 2013-08-07 17:03:20
Let's say in two months the price per bitcoin doubles back up to 200 usd. 
You would have just spent twice as much money on those erupters as they were worth.  Boy that would suck, right? 
You may net a profit from other holdings.  But, you would certainly take a big loss on those erupters. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 17:22:10
If you spent dollars instead of btc, wouldn't you be safe from the losses caused by the flux in btc price? 
The price and value of the erupters is not going to go up.   
I've lost about 20 bitcoins due to this flux.   If I had spent dollars, or a similar inflationary currency instead of bitcoins.  My personal value would be 2000 dollars more. 
Your suggestion of replacing spent bitcoins is the same as spending dollars, just less efficient.

Don't lie  =P
you're in it because deflationary currencies are profitable.

Uhm,  so if they had 60, that wouldn't be over 51?

This exactly.  Especially knc

I'm going to post this around a few of the crypto forums. 
Democrat reporting in.  I like bitcoin too.   But, there is room for a second crypto.  One that has an inflationary self regulated model of mining. It would have to start as limited and deflationary to boost initial value though.  
Mining rate would dynamically change control the value to prevent bubbles.  Specifically to prevent value from skyrocketing when a very wealthy person(s) or group buys in. 
Similarly mining rate would slow when price starts to plummet. 
Problem with bitcoin is the same as the problem with anything limited with value.   If the super rich decide to stock up on bitcoins, the price will soar.  But when they decide to sell for immense profits, the poor and lower class lose chunks of their life savings. 
Similar to what we saw in gold(and bitcoins) recently.  
@_date: 2013-09-04 22:50:01
Sounds like we largely agree, or at least understand standpoints. 
Inflationary currency is used because it is more consistent, controlled, and most of all incites spending and lending which grows economies. 
I'm just not sure Bitcoin can hold/gain in value if it is only used to store value. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 03:19:58
...and its not clear in this context...don't be that guy.

By top few exchanges taking volume and value  of transactions into account.   Number of exchanges used would slide with total volume of trades. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 03:58:55
generally, but had he done this he would be able to pay off the debt and still have a substantial amount.  It would have been a great idea hindsight 20/20. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 03:31:58
"Not spending bitcoins because of hopes of increased value actually decreases the value of bitcoins because its not being used."
Exactly, now you're getting it!  It's stupid to spend bitcoins when the act of spending them could cost you tons of money.  That's the problem with deflation.
By nature the value of bitcoin will always be going up as long as it is gaining in popularity.  Which is a great ground floor for a currency, but the long term prospects are weak. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 08:21:05
So there are(rounded down to make the math easier) 49TH/s now.
If you had 51Th/s  that would make a total of 100TH/s.
And of that 100 you would be 51 = 51%
What am I missing?
Are the attacking Terahashes simultaneously defending?

it was sensational to get all you Krugman haters to read it.

Have you ever spent more than 100 dollars worth of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:37:43
how inferior?  it's roughly the same model..
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:28:18
lol, it's funny that you think another exchange can take the attention.  
@_date: 2013-08-08 03:27:15
Sure it can be done without being "gamed"  Just make the algorithm for which it changes open to the public.  It would automatically change based on the rates of price change.  It would be fairly simple to do.  Difficult to do in the best way.  
"How do you securely agree on a global price tag for the coins? You don't. So that will fail."
What are you talking about?  The same way Bitcoin was.  which is irrelevant to the sentence posted. 
And I'm not a big fan of demurrage.
@_date: 2013-05-31 22:03:44
So you don't need 51% you need 67%

And it can't do that because deflationary currency is bad for spending. 
Bitcoin has a weak future. It will be the savings account while some new inflationary price controlled cryptocurrency will grow for major use. 
Unless vendors and lenders will adopt artificially low prices and negative/no interest rates. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 20:52:46
It seems that you are adding them twice. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 17:02:30
All open and done mathematically. 
The openness I am talking about isn't the code.  It's the mathematical algorithms.   
Presently the fed runs some numbers in secret and pumps money out to the banks.  It's good that they pump money into the economy, bad that the way they do it is in secret. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 15:57:09
Oh then that's simple you take an average from the top exchanges.  And adjustments to mining rewards would not be instant or wild, it would be long term aiming for 2-3 percent inflation for the year. 
This would be after a period of deflationary mining, low mining rewards for the first few years. (to increase value per *coin) 
As value raises you increase mining to increase supply, to decrease value. 
Resulting in a currency with much more constant value.  Something people can trade and loan with confidence. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:08:28
Nope, he needs a viable altcoin that regulates value through an algorithm.

I think they are still supposed to start shipping in August. 
"Going forward we will add Shipping weeks to the other orders such as Week 1 or Week 2.  This will happen nearer the end of August so until then you can assume that shipment queue is based on payment date."
Maybe I misunderstand or have missed something.

Anyone ever used salesforce?  Is like Facebook but for productivity.   Would be great to see similar applications. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 17:23:00
August for first units.  Probably October if you order today. 
That's the claim anyway.   I doubt they will be as bad as bfl...

And the following great depressions and widespread deflation when wealth disparity became unmanageable!
Bitcoin mining is going backwards.  there shouldn't be fewer generated as time passes, there should be more, and there definitely shouldn't be a limit. 
If someone can point me to a crypto that starts at deflationary and ends in inflationary, that is where my bitcoins will go.  Deflationary helps prop the currency up, inflationary makes it viable.  It would be easy to schedule the mining to go that direction. 
As it stands with Bitcoin, a Billionaire could crash the crypto by buying all available and not using them.  Price would skyrocket and value would disappear.

Your picture doesn't add up.  Bitcoin deflation, does not have any effect on the inflationary currency value of a good or service.  
You need a separate seesaw
