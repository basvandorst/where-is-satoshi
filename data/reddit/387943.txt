Don't do this. Your node will be unstable and crash randomly. The software does in no way support this. I've just spent a good 15 minutes being abused by pointing this out to the OP [in another thread]( 
This is brought up time and time again in  always with the unfortunate conclusion that the user has just hosed their node and needs to start all over again. It's like the people on 4chan who tell you to delete your C:/WINDOWS directory to speed up your PC.

It's free money, it really has nothing to do with the university. If I'm paying $200 a week for my apartment and find $20 in the kitchen cupboard, is that not a profit because I'm paying rent?

BitTorrent is so noisy that there's absolutely no privacy involved whatsoever. Anybody who wants can find the seedbox, the bitcoin node is non-existent compared with the number of people aware of the seedbox's presence.

blockchain.info is nothing of the sort. It's 2 factor authentication is useless against almost everything, and they've given their private keys to CloudFlare.

Alright, here's the process:
* your node cycles connections, maybe one of your peers drops or becomes inaccessible 
* you select a new address from your local pool to connect to
* you connect to a fresh node which hasn't got up to speed with the blockchain yet
* they assign you syncnode status, and request a block from you
* your node can't supply the block requested, and crashes out
If you're going to argue with me, at least take the time to understand how the reference software operates before doing so. Claiming that I'm lying really isn't helping you, even if I was incorrect it would be in good faith and therefor not a lie.

Armory, paper wallet, greenaddress.it if you're feeling adventurous (it's a web wallet but not in the traditional sense).
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:53:35


You verify everything. No incoming transaction is relayed until it has been verified to be correct. If you relay a bad transaction you risk being banned by your peers.

Their API is crap though. Don't rely on it.
@_date: 2014-05-01 08:48:38
You don't understand. If your crappy code uses an insecure k for the signature, anybody on the entire bitcoin network can compromise it.

Merkle trees are absolutely stored in the block files. The block .dat files are concatenations of the blocks themselves, which among other things contain the header, POW nonce, and a merkle tree of the transactions. Merkle trees are not used in any other part of the current network, they are simply trimmed when an SPV client requests them. You'll crash out if that happens too.
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:06:08
Still not particularly helpful unfortunately. To be clear you're not doing any harm, peers will connect back occasionally and rely on you a little, but it really needs to be up constantly for it to make a worthwhile impact on the network. 
If you can't do that, you'd be better off donating a little to one of the core developers bounties, especially sipa's headers-first efforts, which when included in the main  client should effect the speed of new syncs more than a thousand dedicated bitcoin nodes would. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:24:54
Nobody anticipated idiots like you. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:59:34
You're a full node but not particularly helpful to the network.

This is horrible advice. Malware could sha256sum every single file on your computer in a few minutes. It's a very fast cryptographic hash specifically designed for that sort of use. This protects you against nothing.

The client actually maxed at 125 connections to prevent DOS issues. Modifying the client to go above 500 is ill advised as it will cause memory corruption. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 09:07:06
I think you're misreading it. Knowing the owner reduces the likeness of it being untrustworthy, I'm sure there's been hundreds of "anonymous" ones that have turned out to be disingenuous before ever growing large. It gives a figurehead to crucify in the media anyway. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 08:20:33
Hardly comparable. Credit cards aren't free money (much the opposite), giving $100US in Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:00:51
Er, no. It will also crash if you try to import a key and *every time a sync node asks you for a block*. This happens very frequently as new nodes join the network. You might say that this will never happen to you because you don't allow incoming connections, but wait until the peers you're connecting to realize they can crash out your node with a single command. It's also possible for you to make an outgoing connection to a still syncing node, there's nothing in the address propagation systems to prevent this happening.


I don't need to, I have just outlined the conditions under which your node will crash. It might work for a day or two, but you'll your p2pool income when your local node crashes. 
The software is not designed for operation like this, please don't encourage other people to damage their node in the same way you have decided to.
@_date: 2014-04-29 06:36:20




Sort of. They Bitcoin are stored in the blockchain, your wallet stores the keys to access them. You can't use the same keys on two clients without causing issues. Using the same keys in two places can cause you to randomly lose your money.


@_date: 2014-04-28 13:53:19
Double spending is not "frowned upon", it's a part of transactions in Bitcoin. If people are relying on them for their security then that's their problem. There's enough of us telling them that they're foolish to do so.
@_date: 2014-04-28 10:16:34
You can't prove that one person isn't running thousands of nodes. I could run millions of nodes in my /8 and you couldn't really prove otherwise. For all intents a node isn't different form any other. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:17:37
If I was lying, why would I choose something as stupid as this? If the node you are syncing from has no access to block files, it will crash as there is no mechanism for recovery. The node is designed to handle a lot abuse from the network side, but blundering users isn't something the developers have ever added contingency for. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 07:08:53
Not a joke really, every key on it is valid and you can reach every key with the pagination. Just it doesn't do what people seem to think of. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 05:37:27
We have different needs. Not many people are syncing and need block data, those that do only ever talk to one peer when they are downloading blocks. Really stable nodes are more desirable than number of nodes, otherwise it takes a long time to work through the lists of non-operational-at-the-moment nodes to find a working one. To make matters worse once a peer marks you as inaccessible it won't bother to try again for a long time. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:22:41
It's nothing to do with my operating system. If the node can't find the block files it will crash out. I can really only assume you are trolling at this point, I can't believe anybody else would be so obtuse. Any other core developer will tell you the same. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:29:09
Never. That's the entire point of the blockchain, to enforce continuity. There's been heaps of douple spends of unconfirmed transactions of course, and reversals of confirmations happens almost daily. That's why nobody can trust zero confirmation transactions, though people insist on trying it.

New versions of armory need a few hundred MB of memory.

That's very likely. They stupidly have their API behind cloudflare, which will constantly prompt you for ReCAPTCHA challenges.. which of course you can't answer because it's an API with no interface. You're best not to bother really. It's unstable and of late increasingly inaccurate. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 03:37:42
What? Where are people getting this terrible idea? Your node will crash if you delete the block files. You can not, must not do this.

If your code creates gimped signatures then they are vulnerable, TAILS or no. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 05:35:17
It's a false positive, there is and never has been a virus. Your virus scanner just deleted some of the vital files Bitcoin Core needs to operate, and has destroyed your current sync state as a result. Your funds are not lost, but you will need to rebuild your blockchain database from scratch.
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:04:31
The merkle trees really only apply to SPV (lite, non-node) clients. They allow full nodes to construct zero trust proofs by presenting bloom-filtered merkle trees and send them back to the SPV client.The SPV client can then use the pruned merkle tree to prove that a particular block and hash header contained a transaction without downloading the whole thing.
 In the normal operation of the reference client the entire merkle tree is transversed and every transaction checked for validity and continuity. If the node didn't, it's possible it could be fed a block with an invalid transaction but valid POW, which would invalidate the whole block later down the track. Verifying everything makes sure the network is all at a consistent state. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:09:07
A core developer and I have both pointed repeatedly out that your advice is awful and will possibly cause people to lose their Bitcoin. There's really nothing else to be said that hasn't been in that topic. You are completely wrong, please don't continue spreading nonsense. 
Posting "requests" that core developers be "kicked out" isn't really helping your case either.

Addresses don't have balances. Never the less, you can just run a local copy on Insight locally and use it's own API without limit.

In a way, you can connect to rogue p2pool nodes designed to steal your income. You trust the fairly pseudonymous node owner. It's probably not to be encouraged just due to that.

No, a transaction can only exist once in the blockchain. Conflicting transactions can't exist without invalidating the blocks they are in.

Why do people keep abusing me for spreading correct information? You can't do this as change addresses will screw you over. Using the same private key in two clients will work just once before they become unusable.
