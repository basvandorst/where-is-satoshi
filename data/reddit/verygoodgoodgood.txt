I’m leaving, although my reasons are more due to the “surprise” bch addition and the constant services outages and bugs. 
It feels like whenever I actually want to buy, gdax has issues

It’s a centralized system designed to move money around easier. It’s being used primarily by very large banks. It isn’t decentralized, so it isn’t a crypto coin in truth

Whenever you add a new authentication, it should give you a backup seed. You’re supposed to back those up

I spent .002 (38$) to move btc out of my electrum wallet yesterday and it took 10 hours to complete 
That’s frankly unacceptable

I literally logged in to cash gains at 19k and couldn’t because gdax was down 
So bummed

It’s only going to be harder to own 1 btc. And like the other comment said, “bitcoin” is arbitrary, and can be broken up into however many pieces you want.

Get the nice hash mining client. It should bump your profits up i more than a dollar a week depending on your card.

Many here aren’t aware of exchanges that allow these orders exist.

I have a fuck ton of siacoins from dual mining back in the day on ethereum. If it ever makes it big as an altcoin I’ll be rich. 
Until then, lll let my 10$ sit

I don’t know for sure, but as nobody has commented yet, does Electrum require downloading the block chain to your computer? If so your balance wouldn’t show until it’s downloaded the blocks that contain the transaction.

What makes gdax a better place to put them than Coinbase?
