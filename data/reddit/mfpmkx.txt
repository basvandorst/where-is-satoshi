If btc wants to grow further, which we all want to see it do, it has to become more than a big boy wallet.

Right lol

This is the weakest argument. What use is holding it when another coin can have the same functionality?
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:50:01
Man i cant stand the people in this thread implying that it was somehow never meant for small transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:27:52
Never seen businesses accept much aside from btc and ltc but I dont know a comprehensive list!

People love the africa example. The argument originally centred around the low fees, and I love how its the first one pulled out here haha.
The other examples are all good reasons why bitcoin can be useful, but at the same time those things can all be implemented without high transaction fees.
Like someone else said, this isnt the bitcoin I signed up for. It was meant to be able to be used for microtransactions just as much as large ones.

Well thats great, but people can't always buy btc at a fraction of the price that it is worth ???. What a useless example.
Yeah, 125/coin adopters may be willing to pay those fees, but it doesn't mean its a smart idea lol. So you know, you paid a real world equivalent of $11, because that is the value of the btc you paid. 
If record prices continue to fall it just becomes more and more of an issue, and it makes btc less accessible and frankly have fewer applications.

Anyone trying to suppress this is an idiot... It is a real issue at the moment and if it doesn't get adequately resolved will compromise the value of the coins.

No, we really don't. There isn't any reason why all transactions couldn't be processed by whichever coin offers the lowest fees for people transferring money. Why have two coins for things of different values?
Btc isnt divisible into satoshis because its meant to be limited in terms of payment sizes.

If one is expensive to transact with it can't be easy and cheap to convert between the two without there being centralisation like an exchange, which defeats the whole point imo. Exchanging requires moving coins, and if that has a transaction fee, exchanging is going to cost money.

Yeah I'm going to go ahead and say leaving that on while you're at work would be a terrible idea haha
