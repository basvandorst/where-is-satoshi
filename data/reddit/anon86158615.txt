No, I am blaming coinbase for having slow, intuitive, unresponsive customer service.

Would you rather keep it online, where someone could "accidentally" close down your account and "lose" your bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:11:50
Fair, but it is kind of their fault that their customer service has been consistently bad for... forever, actually. Are there no other sites *not including Gemini* that I can use to buy bitcoin from and transfer to my cold wallet? The ones I found just let you buy and sell, not send. Which seems very fish.

Not when theres an alternative, already used currency. If we have dollars, why should we use acorns? no one else uses acorns.

I hate the Hodl mindset. Yes, it's smart to hold on to a few, but if theres a limited amount and everybody just holds on, theres no room for the economy to grow. Spend some here and there, when it goes up think of it as a free cup of coffee or a game or something, yes in the future when its potentially worth more, oh no, you made 2000 bajillion dollars instead of 2001 bajillion dollars, but you need to let the economy grow to make any dollars at all. Or buy low sell high and at least let it stay in circulation, PLUS extra growth. I really don't understand the "HURR URR HODL FOR ALL YOU'RE WORTH NEVER LET IT OUT OF THE SAFE" cmon, its hurting the overall bitcoin community

can you really divide a satoshi?
also the economy still wont grow if its not used as a currency. If everyone said acorns were worth 10000 dollars each, and everyone just held on to their acorns in hopes of them going up each year in value, does it really matter that everyone has acorns? What are they good for? They're really just useless if everyone just expects extra money for owning the acorn. If everyone is buying and selling things for acorns, however, they have true value, because places can survive off of acorn trade, and they have a place and usage.

Yes, but if no one is buying things with it, it doesn't have a load of value does it. A bunch of people holding it means nothing. Remember beanie babies? It's not like you can just hold on to it forever and have U N L I M I T E D M O N I E S

OOOooooOOOOoooooh nooOOOooooOOOOoo we wouldn't want any hint of stability! So many people just want the "OOoooOOOops made 10 million dollars in a day" if you really want the cryptocurrency to take off, this is good.
