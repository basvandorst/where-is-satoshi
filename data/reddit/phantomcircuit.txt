That doesn't actually mean anything though.
MtGox was generating transactions which most of the network would not relay or mine.
Those transactions were then being mutated into things which the network would relay and mine.
The only evidence of this would be in mempool logs.
That there is any evidence of it in blocks is merely a curiosity.

Your number for Thin Blocks is wrong.
A full node must see all of the transactions in all of the blocks including the signatures.
The best we can hope for in improvements there is to avoid sending the same thing twice.
At best that's a one time only 2x capacity improvement. (And frankly we're on track to MASSIVELY overshoot what most users can handle... so any improvement there should really just go towards keeping things working).

@_date: 2015-12-09 18:15:59










The potential reward is vastly different.
As an attacker with &gt;50% of hashing power the potential reward for reversing 6 blocks is relatively low.
You can double spend within that window and you guarantee that you receive the entire mining reward.
As an attacker with &gt;50% of hashing power **attacking spv clients** the potential reward is essentially infinite.
You can create coins from nowhere above the 21 million bitcoin limit.
Bitcoin security relies on the adversarial position of full nodes and miners to maintain it's security.
Without full nodes miners can create more than the 21 million bitcoin limit as well as double spend.
Without miners... well full nodes wouldn't be able to agree on anything.

To be pedantic segregated witness allows for delayed processing of the scripts (witness).
The biggest risk with non-verifying SPV clients is that a false UTXO entry is spent and coins are created from nowhere.
With Segregated Witness that specific attack can be detected in the first 1MB of data instead of requiring the full block.
Until the Witness is downloaded and verified the node is operating in a reduced security model.
It's clearly a win.

The stronger argument against larger blocks is the explosion in cost to complete initial block synchronization. (My presentation at the first workshop on this: 
Segregated witness does improve the time to complete initial block download, however only if the node is operating in the less secure mode with checkpoints.
So it provides some increase in usable capacity but only for nodes operating in a weaker security model.
It is still (and will always be) the case that a full node operator needs to download 100% of the blockchain data.

Fraud proofs are a reduced security model.
An attacker that can partition a verifying spv node (ie fraud proof verifying node) is able to prevent the victim from receiving fraud proofs.
That means the attacker is able to fraudulently build a block which pays them infinite additional coins. (For those of you reading this who aren't gavin, yes more than 21 million bitcoins).
I once held very very high hopes that fraud proofs would be suitable for replacing full nodes as the principle mechanism for securing the network.
However it's now clear that fraud proofs are only suitable for improving the security of spv clients, not for replacing full nodes.

A hub cannot do any of these things, by design.
Lightning users explicitly do not trust the hub.
The hub has two choices when it receives a transaction.
* The hub can ignore the transaction
* The hub can process the transaction
If the hub ignores the transaction the user closes the channel and moves it to another hub.

The goal is the reduction of trust, with bitcoin we get that through decentralization.

Unfortunately it very much is inherent in the protocol.
Bitcoin is only low trust for full nodes.
For bitcoin to remain low trust all users of the system must be able to run a full node.
The larger the blockchain is the fewer people will be able to run a full node.


Unfortunately the trade off is not between decentralization (which is a proxy for trust in bitcoin) and redundancy, but rather between decentralization (ie trustlessness) and total transaction volume.

Lightning does not require a hard fork to work.
The original design for lightning may have required a hard fork to support the entire worlds population transacting with bitcoin.
Without a hard fork that original design would be able to handle tens or hundreds of times the current transaction volume.
Beyond that there is a new design which involves re-balancing the channels instead of closing them.  It's not clear yet, but it seems that this design would allow for significantly higher multiples (think 1000-100000 times).
It's really exciting.
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:37:38


The computation cost of initial block synchronization is already outpacing the drop in cost for compute time.
That would indicate that there is actually no head room or even that the limit should be dropped.

That's actually a really good reason to keep your funds time locked with multiple hubs.
Even then the worst they can do is to maybe keep you from spending your funds for the time lock period.  Are they really going to be able to get more in ransom to unlock funds 30 days earlier than they would from transaction fees?
I doubt it (especially since you'll be able to find people that will buy your time locked coins!).

I'll skip some of the intermediary arguments such as: the user switches to a new hub and routes the payment through that one or the user switches identities on the hub by closing the channel and opening a new one.
Fundamentally there are two scenarios here:
* The merchant wants to enforce those rules and selected the hub because it does
* The merchant does not care about rule enforcement and selected the hub for some other reason
In the first scenario it's the merchant enforcing the rules and there is no reasonable way to get around them. The situation is identical in bitcoin today (think rules enforced by coinbase/bitpay).
In the second scenario the merchant gets emails from people trying to pay them who cannot and opens a channel with another hub where users can pay them.
In both cases the ability to transaction without restriction is identical to bitcoin.


It doesn't though, that's the entire purpose of the hash locking in the transactions.
Possibly I've misunderstood your question?

Lightning hubs... I guess could technically operate as SPV clients.
That would be a huge mistake though.

@_date: 2015-08-17 05:47:19


If the user follows the protocol then there is no risk of lose.
The user needs to maintain the channels state (similar to keeping private keys in a wallet.dat).
The user needs to monitor the bitcoin blockchain for the hub attempting to unilaterally close the channel. (This is the principle security trade off that Lightning makes.)
Monitoring the blockchain is something that can be outsourced to third parties for a small fee. (ie they monitor the blockchain for you and broadcast a transaction that pays you the funds in the channel minus a fee.)
The hub can disappear entirely and the user will still get their funds back after the lock up period.

Lightning provides a simple solution to this problem.

@_date: 2015-08-17 06:03:59


You do not need to have a channel on the same hub as the recipient.
That is actually the defining improvement that lightning has over normal hub and spoke micro payment servers.
As long as your hub has a channel open with their hub you can make the payment. (Or even a longer chain!)

This event has demonstrated that miners are today not validating the chain they're extending because blocks are already too large.
The important distinction is between validating the chain they are extending and generating larger blocks.
The worst possible world for SPV clients is one in which miners are not validaing blocks.
This event showed that the blocksize limit we have today is indeed too large and should actually be reduced.

However they are not a replacement for full node security.

All it's doing is reconstructing the block by requesting the transactions the recipient does not have in it's mempool instead of requesting the entire block.
You still have to download the transactions at least once.
@_date: 2016-02-19 01:31:29








It guarantees that there will be an extra round trip for the node receiving the block to request the transactions not already in it's mempool.
Which is to say best case this can improve bandwidth costs for nodes on the p2p network, but at the cost of doubling the number of round trip requests that have to be made.
That's fine if you're testing against localhost but very very bad if you're running a node on tor.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network.
Entry into the network is synonymous with Initial Block Synchronization (IBS).
IBS must be reasonably possibly for anybody who is expected to be a participant.

You've got that backwards, we should not assume that a solution for IBD sync that maintains the current security is something that can be implemented reasonably.

That means you will download and validate the entire blockchain, but you will not keep all of the blockchain data, just enough to validate the next block.

If the average block grows at a linear rate ie O(n) then the time to validate is growing in quadratic time O( n^2 ).

CPFP requires miners to implement a knapsack solver (an NP-HARD problem).
It also wastes a bunch of bytes as you need to create a child transaction that otherwise wouldn't exist.

Assuming 20% annual improvement in bandwidth.
46 GB * 20% = 9.2 GB per year ~= 180kB per block.
Anything more and the cost to synchronize will grow at a super linear rate.

If the blockchain is huge then miners will not run full nodes.
Their security will be the same as the rest of the network.
(I wish this wasn't true, but SPV mining is already a thing today.)


I'm assuming that by UTXO commitment checkpoint you mean there is a third party verified (block_height , utxo_root_commitment) pair.
Assuming we trust the third party (a 5 year old commitment checkpoint is probably safer than the code for sure).
The cost to get around the checkpoint is 5 years of mining.
The problem is that the reward for cheating and building a fake UTXO commitment is literally **INFINITY** bitcoins.
(Remember that the reward for building a fake chain is maximum 21 million bitcoins if everybody is using full nodes).
Then keep in mind that the hashrate has grown exponentially so 5 years of mining is nowhere near as expensive as it sounds.
@_date: 2015-11-03 12:44:34
That increases the complexity cost of storing a block by a huge amount.

Originally bitcoin used the pubkey as the identifier.
Satoshi changed this relatively early to pubkeyhash (addresses).
There are a number of technical advantages to using a pubkey hash over the raw public key.
At least in theory pubkeyhash outputs are potentially secure against quantum computers. (Assuming the speed up you get from a quantum computer isn't sufficient to break the key in &lt; 1 hour).

UTXO lookups are O(log n) which means each lookup gets more expensive as the database grows larger.
That's to say the UTXO set database does not and will not scale.
@_date: 2015-10-20 21:46:21






At a high level a hash table lookup complexity is O(1); insert complexity is O(1); and resize complexity is O(n).
If the UTXO set is growing then that resize complexity is a real killer.

There's some confusion here.
Full node count itself is not very important.
What is important is that the users of the system are using full nodes.
There's no way to directly measure the number of users, but I chose to assume it's going up not down.
So we use the full node count as a proxy indicator for the percentage of users running full nodes.
Creating incentives for non-users to run full nodes is not helpful.
