Perhaps an analogy would help : Physics and Chemistry are 2 different fields of study... Atom is a "common" element that is understandable common unit that crosses over between the 2 fields of study.. 
In Bitcoin 
What is that "common unit" point which crosses field between Maths Economics and Computer Science ? -- Think in terms of Venn diagram.. What is common Denominator ?

Perhaps its time to take a hard look at the system from which he was able to make the 63 billion. In all fairness he is often time critical of the unjust system himself.  
On a related note When Warren Buffet was collecting dividends from the preferred shares from his investment in  Goldman Sachs in 2009  Satoshi mined the first block in block chain with the following headline 
"Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks" - 
While  money is never fungible for 99% it is very much so for the other 1%.

You are right  ordinary civilians would never be interested.... until they need .Yes you are also right it would be dull ... but it will always be educational for those who have questions and needs perspective. 
Bitcoin have its learning curve and sometimes it is a talk sometimes a movie other times a simple blog, most of us have found our own path.
While on the subject , a short movie about bitcoin helping some random 5 families with money remittance for the underbanked. Compared to the abuse some of us have to go through in a regular bank. If you happen to have the privilege to bank while BROWN, to access your own money above a certain amount in North America in 2014 is not a very smooth one.  A great cut for a documentary.

Sometime you can make a name for yourself by publicly taking an opposing position against "the most successful investor alive". 
Buffet biggest strategy is buy and hold and believe in compounding interest from those holdings. - Now he saw value in coca cola stocks many years ago before most people were able to see it. Bitcoin is not much different from any long term investment. ( no one knows how long is this 'long term ')
Buffet is no doubt one unique investor among other things but lets be honest. The week  fed &amp; treasury announced the 800 B dollar bailout, Buffet invested in Goldman Sachs, an investment which did very well. Point being  Buffet in some case directly and many case indirectly benefits from the existing system. When Napster Kaza and Limewire were trying to get off the ground many record label investors owners who build fairly successful business, had a similar response stay away from these digital media. Its a  Mirage.

Peter has helped many, realize substantial profits between 2005 and 2007 in precious metal market. 
Its seems, he is going through his learning curve of bitcoin, while maintaining a healthy skepticism, and if you listen carefully in between the lines , it is a slippery slope. 
1.) I am just allowing my customers to buy gold with bitcoin.(  Bitpay/Coinbase should work with him to disclose if he is selling all his bitcoin or what % is he holding ?)
2.) Tax write off advantages for coin.
Next stop
3.) Schiff Bullion Coin in partnership with Erik Voorhees at coinapult. :) Speculative timeline 2016 .
Its really interesting to listen. It seems there is almost a desire in the rant to figure out the bottom / buy point for bitcoin.  Someone Martian may observe the following. 
All you fools who have bought these bitcoin at 1200$ sell them, ..sell them and sell them quick ?
why you ask .. because look you have all these "tax loss benifit" you can benefit from. 
Ofcourse  don't worry about the side effect of all the selling. As it may help "Euro pacific" and other get a more favorable price for our future plans.
Peter is a well respected investor by many in bitcoin community and its really interesting to see his slow and steady ongoing transition.

Bitcoin has its  learning curve . Each one of these guys are somewhere along that curve.  3 Years ago most of these guys would not even entertain the question today they have a public opinion. They all have reputation to protect so most would deflect the question by talking about blockchain technology, pretending as if these are 2 different things.
* Bill Gates
* Ron Pual
* Eric Schmidt 
* Vikram Pandit and all other CEO who got money as part of bailout.
* Most investment house &amp; VC who are pouring money in the space.
* Peter Schiff - He is accepting it which is just a slippy slope. His brother Andrew might be doing something in cryptospace in near future.

Most will agree with your point about VC, they are never the best measure of success. None the less these people have publicly changed their options. 
From completely  dismissing it 3 years ago to publicly addressing it is a change .. a subtle one but its a change .. . Are they bitcoin Evangelist like Draper, Marc Andreessen , Naval Ravikant and others. No . Are they on their way on this long journey. Perhaps. Some of them who are young enough to go down the rabbit hole - Yes 
Remember every single smart investor has acknowledged bitcoin is not easy to wrap your head around . It requires discipline and effort. 
Keep in mind Buffet and Charlie are not avid users of internet It will take a miracle for them to spend time to learn bitcoin. They are not necessarily relevant.

Bitcoin is

* Protocol 
* Database
* Fundamental breakthrough in CS from Byzantine General problem 
* Form of speech
* Currency ~ Not a useful one 
* As you know, many have compared it to internet.

If someone wants to bring new people on board we can provide ATM machine. Most ATms are charging margins , which are all over the place.

If cloud hashing companies are independently investigated I am sure It will uncover many unscrupulous practices.

Sorry to inform you. Banks in order to undertake such an activity would usually need an "EVP or above" level approval. Country to popular belief such efforts have constrained budgets .

How many people have full confidence that 13 banks are going to implement private chains concept internally and are going to disrupt themselves from inside ?  It would be helpful if you have worked on a multi year project at a bank .
If the point isnt clear..You DO NOT want banks to implement Bitcoin for such a "marvelous endeavor"

A person who is questioning other's integrity and motivation, should be able to answer question about their own. In order to get rid of any potential conflict of interests. 
Peter Todd has contributed to multiple projects including Viacoin ...looking at the the pull request of some of those patches there were certain interesting interactions. 
So mike asked the an important question to btcdrak ....Where did btcdrak got the money to hire Peter Todd ? Was it free consulting ? source of funding for project is a rather important question when people are evaluating other people motivation.

If the merchants have been setup properly and with the 
1.Correct Services and 
2.The appropriate support and training 
that is If the experience is somewhat different from here is your (Bitpay Coinbase etc) merchant service account setup ... Cash in cash out daily basis they are likely to stick around after the price crash and a bubble like this....While the merchant does not have the time for this kind of learning. Companies that are likely to establish them self for long term are going to invest in customer education, retention and post conversation support.

Banks do know how to Adapt - (Sometimes) , but the speed with which they can adapt what is the major question. One of the best ways to analogize this may be 'Titanic' ......
'Iceberg right ahead' (Within a bank very small set of people who are and will be invited to the R3CV steering committee . These guys would be the guy out in the cold staring and shouting at the Iceberg)..The person in charge (Your EVP of innovation would try and may succeed ) was able to change direction and was able to change direction .. but not at a fast enough pace. Sinking didnt happen right away ...it almost took 3 hours  (10 Years  maybe), and many people on the boat in 1st class were so convinced that Titanic is Unsinkable ..it was a very different feeling in the 3rd Class where people were mostly locked up (Geece ..Cyprus).. so when we think about it there are some very interesting parallels .
