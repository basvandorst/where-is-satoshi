Would this ever solve and be rewarded for mining? Or is it just about acting as a p2p to share the blockchain ledger?

I came here to find this discussion. I had the same thought. This is essentially printing money. If this were a real market, doubling the supply would half the value. But it's not. 
I've read some of the technical challenges btc faces and how sigwit was there to fix it, but it's the same people behind it that got us into these technical challenges in teh first place. When they applied the bandaid to artifically limit the solve rate of bitcoin, they essentially killed it. The solution didn't scale, now we're left with a currency that's handicap with the inability to experience growth. 20mb/s hash rate or similiar. This causes the speed of transactions to take longer and longer to settle, and the transaction fees larger and larger.   btc from a technical standpoint will never work as a means of transactions to replace credit cards in every day life.  It's become an ETF. A stock.  But the underlying technology is hampered. it's broken. How the fork was handled is a betrayal to the vision Satoshi had when he created the currency that was supposed to be out of the control of a central authority.   Bitcoin actually died by the central authority.
The only way forward is a new alt currency.  ETH isn't it. It doesn't exist yet but it will take the learnings from this failed currency. It will be a more like bittorrent where the more people that use it, the faster it gets.
time to start selling. for me at least.

Been around long enough to see the china ban stpry used over and over. It's psychological.. You should be looking at price dips like this and buying in.
Op has come to same conclusion I have. This is purely about supply and demand and its mathmatically certain to keep rising until the big players that got in early decide to cash out big league when thry retire.

My google notification for a news article this morning was "North Korea saving a bitcoin war chest".    I came here to read the latest.  This is one way governments will attempt to link bitcoin with terrorism as a means to shutdown the exchanges.
If you're like me and have kept your btc in coinbase, it's time to start thinking about offline hardware wallets. Just picked up a trezor.
Had an almost shit my pants moment when I couldn't log into coinbase using my 2 factor login.  An hour later I realized I had switched it from Authy to Google Authenticator.

Related questiin. When you buy btc via coinbase and you have to wait 5 days to settle.. Are you locking in the sale when you hit the buy button or delaying to the market value at the time the funds settle (5 days later)

Yawn.. Same old china bitcoin ban scare. Seems to trick newbies every single time.   Akin to the silver market always fearing silver shortages.. Never materializes.  Silver is way down since 2008 when it was forcasted to at least quadruple in price.

Nobody can accurately predict, even you.  I've been invested since 2012 and 1800$ sounds about right.  But that's just my prediction. ;) 
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:13:39


Good point. I bought this on advice of mcafee in a recent interview he mentioned that was his favorite at the moment.  What you said seems very plausible.. Why should I trust a closed source hardware wallet anymore than I would trust the coinbase exchange? 
Can I ask then, is there an open source trusted hardware wallet with the least risk factor? 
Also.. Trezor.. Trent Reznor of NiN?

Its about regulation. Nobody freaked out when coinbase added additional security to verify account holders. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:45:10
Of course. Jp morgon has a large vested interest in bitcoin they have been buying over the last year.  They publically bad mouth it and sell off their shares on a schedule until it goes down down, then they wait awhile and a year later start it all over at a cheaper price.  Youll notice their is still downward pressure on btc and it's because they are still in thei scheduled sell off phase.
Fuck them. Just hold.

Couple of months?  Last time it was a couple of years before it recovered and set new highs.  I have no doubts it will recover but your forcast is a bit optomistic.   Will probably hit 1800 as a low. 2k and plus was just speculation in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:35:35
I remeber thinking.. 2k..anything over this is a bubble.  It was pumped up to 5k!  Jp morgon pumped it up... Jp morgon is selling it off systematically.  Will come down to 2k... Buy in at 2,300. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:33:07
I predict 1800 low.  Remind me 4 months
