Back by nothing? Facebook is one of the most powerful companies in the world.

How will bitcoin on a large scale deal with the idea that a deflationary currency rewards hoarding and discourages/financially punishes acquiring of low interest capital investments like houses?

Yeah wtf is this? Democracy and Communism are not descriptors of monetary policy nor do they require a particular method of currency. Hell democracy and communism aren’t even opposites - democracy is not equivalent to capitalism - and communism has a lot of democracy embedded in most of its iterations.
A communist country could easily use crypto as a way to distribute wealth.

Currency is not a product. You can't just say that and then apply a bunch of other irrelevant statements to make it seem sinister. You are mixing terms for things that are not relevant. It is similar to thinking the term "fruit" means the same thing to a chef that it does to a plant biologist. They sound right and share some properties, but you cannot apply all terms to them as though they are equivalent. 
Currency is not a product and you cannot have a "monopoly" on it in the sense you are implying, no matter how many capital letters you use. 
Also, I don't think you know what a pun is.

No, gold can store value but is physical and has uses beyond currency  that helps to make it inherently valuable (aka gold will never be worthless because of its useful metallurgical properties). The longevity and stability of gold over thousands of years has helped this. Also, gold is not deflationary.

Bitcoin is worth 14B now, it won't be tomorrow. Its value is completely speculative. 
Fiat currency is not a 'monopoly' because that word simply is not applicable to currency. Using it in this context is intentionally confusing.

Literally everyone, including the name "crptocurrency".
Bitcoins entire value is generated from the fact that it's supposed to be a currency. The theory that it one day could be is literally the only piece of value it has. Otherwise it's just strings of numbers that follow an arbitrary ruleset.

Right, but it's inherent value as a useful commodity makes it more stable. Gold will never be valueless until someone invents a philospher's stone.
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:11:16
Still have to pay to get it. Could be we find an all gold planet in the future and yeah it becomes valueless, but we are talking about realistic scenarios.

The purpose of currency isn't to make money.

And this is why people think bitcoin is a bad replacement for regular currency. "Buying into" a currency "late" shouldn't be a disadvantage and due to its deflationary nature, the more people that try to buy in the more expensive it will become. 
Sorry poor people, now even money is too expensive for you!

Because a bunch of graphics cards that have been running 24/7 for years far away from data centers, on valueless land aren’t worth anything.

I mean, you were a condescending dick, so I acted like one to you, especially since in the course of telling someone they didn't understand technology, you misrepresented it pretty severely.
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:05:05
Oh so they used a specific piece of machinery not applicable to a wider use case. That’s makes these even less valuable. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:46:44
That's not the same at all. Thinking of bitcoin like a product is something that is actually contributing to confusion and instability of it.
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:58:20
I dont say to do anything - but if you want something to succeed - spreading misinformation isnt valuable.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:03:01
My question is: why did you buy bitcoins? I don’t own any crypto, from reading your posts you seem to be suggesting it’s a get rich quick scheme? 
Shouldn’t someone who wants bitcoin to stabilize be encouraging the use of it as a currency? Spending it frequently and encouraging others the do the same?
Holding because you want it to be a currency in the future (but also when you are rich from it) seems like the opposite of the spirit of the coin.
You seem to be suggesting others use it as a currency and you just hold for future riches?

I don't think Bitcoin is a scam. However, Bitcoin is not the technology - bitcoin is a usage of the technology - confusing the two is incorrect.
Plenty of useful technologies can be exploited to scam people. Moreover, plenty of scumbag people use non-scam implementations of technology to scam people.
Your comment amounts to: "How can you say with a straight face that all robo-call telemarketing is a scam. The technology that allows you to automatically make phone calls is really exciting! Unless you don't understand the technology of course"
You sound really condescending and, frankly, like you lack an understanding of the topic. Part of the problem with Bitcoin and crypto in general are people with exactly your attitude: "If you don't like this, you must be stupid".

Question from a bitcoin skeptic: how will bitcoin replace the primary services banks provide? Interest and credit lending that spur people to save and generate value through capital?
