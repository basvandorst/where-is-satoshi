A recent paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis states "in some ways, Bitcoin is more robust than fiat" and, "crypto assets are posied to become a welcome and important asset class."

Even as a white male, and even if you encounter something that qualifies as “white male patriarchy,” I think the point was that you shouldn’t target “white male patriarchy,” but instead be mindful of any and all forms of discrimination.

The only one I can think of (and I’m really picking the nit here) is that Coinbase has a nice overview of your crypto account balances on mobile whereas on GDAX you have to switch between currencies to see your balance.

“ridiculously overpriced car” sure, but why shitcar? Some cars (including the M4) are excellent and worth every bit of the price tag. The M4 isn’t even that much of a standout.

If you want help with this on specific aspects of the wallet, I can lend a hand. I have no certification of formal training in this area, but I like to think this way and find system design/UX very enjoyable, especially something fun like digging into the fundamentals of a cutting edge technology and making it digestible for everyone, regardless of technical literacy. 
This is one of the main hurdles the crypto scene has been dealing with lately; you have experts who know what they’re talking about, and you have people talking about crypto on a basic level getting plenty of spotlight, but you don’t really have many experts breaking it down to a basic level getting the spotlight. We need all 3 pieces: actual experts, audience-appropriate explanations, and volume/exposure. 
The layman doesn’t need to understand the technical intricacies of crypto, they need simple examples of how it’s going to be used and how they fit into those applications. Then the value (which they can and should decide for themselves) will be obvious and their support will follow.

This is for Ethereum, but there are plenty of innovative initiatives in the works for Bitcoin as well. I can’t wait to see what happens in the next few years!

One reason is that many exchanges convert altcoins to BTC before converting to USD, which means there’s a soft tie to the price of BTC in some level.

Yeah, I can’t say that I ever fell into that camp. I heard about Bitcoin and was immediately curious about the tech, queue rabbit hole. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:53:28
Also, there’s a difference between a bubble and a legitimate store of value that’s *in* a bubble because of speculative overvaluation. 
A true bubble will always inherently be overvalued until it pops. Bitcoin actually has intrinsic value but got a bit ahead of itself in price. Very different. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:09:48
Do you have any links or technology names to share? Very interested in following these developments. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:04
Valid. It’s always better to learn as much as you can about all points of view regardless of your personal subscription / stance. Studying an opposing view can help you find flaws in their logic or introduce a variable that you may have overlooked.

When there is a hard fork, the new currency is created in parallel to Bitcoin for that snapshot of the blockchain. Basically, if you had $100 worth of Bitcoin before a fork, you would keep your $100 of Bitcoin and also have $100 worth of the new currency. 
So for folks finding old wallets, they almost always held Bitcoin before forks, meaning they have additional crypto waiting to be claimed.

You have to admit that Harold’s participation in r/bitcoin is somewhat unique. He’s usually 100 layers of wrong. 
I’m happy for Harold the HODLer. :)
See above... I wasn’t referring to this post. I was referring to Hardold the HODLER. Which this guy isn’t. There is a Harold who bought at $9700 and is still hodling to this day.

Sounds good. I’ll start playing with some models of what this might look like along with an accompanying strategy for implementation.

Take note, OP. There are plenty of solid stats on registration walls in marketing/UX design. You have a phenomenal product; don’t limit your user base on the front end. :)

The price of being an early adopter is the painful awareness of glaring flaws in scalabilitity and resilience. Bitcoin will have to endure some growing pains to become a full scale currency. The good news is that it’s open source and has a passionate community of developers and testers behind it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:02:32
Can’t agree enough. Things like this are why I want to be a researcher. Let’s take a look at the relationship between rapidity of onset and efficacy of pushback, model the findings, and use the model to predict similar outcomes in the future. Apply this approach to literally any dilemma (or thought experiment), and you can adapt at an astounding rate.

I’ve noticed this too. My reaction? Grab the one that’s “dipping” for a continuous slalom of dollar cost averaging in BTC and LTC.
