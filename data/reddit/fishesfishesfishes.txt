Someone bought a lot of bitcoins, people saw that "geez, that dude buys a lot! I better buy to", so they buy. Then everyone sees that the price is going up up up up up, and they think "I can buy now and sell later, and outsmart every sucker". This is called a bubble, and they who think they can outsmart suckers are the suckers who are outsmarted, every time.
Expect the bubble to burst in this week or the next, and the price falling to maybe 5$-ish.

Look at it as two different charts in one picture. For the green chart, the y-axis is time, and for the blue/yellow chart the y-axis is amount of bitcoin at x price.
@_date: 2012-07-15 23:21:39
Are you for real, or is this fanta sea?
@_date: 2012-07-18 07:59:33
Ok, I'll try better.
The image consists of two chats mashed up in one picture. That is confusing, but for people with great chart-reading-foo it is nice. 
The yellow chart shows buy orders, the x-axis is price and the y-axis is amount at x price. The blue is the same, but for sell orders. 
The green juggly chart in the middle is the real price, the price people buy or sell for. In that chart the y-axis is time, and the x-axis is (just as in the blue/yellow chart) price. 
I'm afraid I can't simplify it any more. Sorry!

It would only be unresponsible if the website owner was a dick and did not show any information on why the users fan was so loud and battery so drained. 
But yeah, BTCPlus are dicks.

Diablominer works just fine on my macbook pro-laptop. It doesnt prompt you for a name and password and server, but you have to enter them as arguments to the command. There is a lot of information about how to start a miner from the command line. Google that and then read up.

That is it is about bitcoins being worth x*&lt;other commodity&gt;. And that is really not that fun, I'm sorry. 
@_date: 2012-07-17 23:21:48
I don't know much about theese things, but I believe not. The name suggest so, but the name isnt all. 
It's your usual mining company where you instead of buying stocks from a stock exchange invest x btc and then get payouts from the hardware he buys with that money.

I think you forgot the link, mate!

Why is everyone so eager to see bitcoins being expensive? It really doesnt matter how many USD a bitcoin can buy you. What matters is that we have a currency based on trust in crypto rather than trust in government, and that is amazing and freaking fantastic. 
Also, sorry for sounding like a naysayer, just a bit tired with this contant talk about bitcoin being worth x usd and whatnot.

Either do two newlines, instead of just one

As always, it will be down at ~3usd and then up to ~20 and then down again. We have seen it many times, and nothing suggests it wont go the same way. 
But that is not bad! We are still in beta, remember that.

No, I mean to own gold that you stored at their place.

But we did recover from the 1929 disaster. I agree that big money should be more regulated to hinder these catastrophes, but that is not something bitcoin is better on than any other currency. 
Don't get me wrong, bitcoin is creat and super-cool tech, but it is not an universal cure against all economic problems.
@_date: 2012-07-29 09:41:25
Remember that bitcoin was invented almost yesterday, so that thing we call "the bubble" is really merely just the first bubble of many to come.

Bitcoin Plus has a history of not paying out to it's users and not answering mail.

You should know that an attacker could change the client-side code on blockchain.info so that it phones home your private key.

Here's your password: 12hmhyrugd9nFZKqsJZgL5q7cBcpyMRwvM
No, I don't really know who you should contact, but in the future you should really get a good password manager and keep multiple backups of its database. Keepass is great (keepassx for mac and linux). On mac there is one called 1Password that is nice, and easy to use (but costs a couple of bucks). It will help you to use strong passwords and to have unique passwords for every service, so that you'll be safe. I hear some use two factor auth to open their password-managers too, adding an extra layer of security. 
Our bitcoin wallet(s) and password databases are the most important data we own, encrypt them and keep them backed up.

Well, with it being not tested in courts and all, that would be a disasterous idea in a law firm. Everything has it's time, and this is not the time to introduce everyone and her neighbour to bitcoins, but to make a stable market that grows steadily.
@_date: 2012-07-20 19:04:35
Thank you!

Do you really think it will crumble? Really?
@_date: 2012-07-18 07:55:26
There are many shouting 'bubble' and selling now, soooooooooooooo I wouldnt bet on it, but that's just me. 
@_date: 2012-07-18 20:31:38
People with lot of money in bitcoins realise "Hey, this looks just like a financial bubble!" and they sell as fcuk.
Then one morning the price is at $4, and all newbies who hoped to earn a buck playing on the exchanges loose hundreds. 
This is also why a shorting service (or regulated exchange, both have the same effect) would be nice to have. Thanks a lot, Bitcoinia hackers.

Fokes! We are all sorry for matthews loss, but glad it wasn't any astronomical sums. 
Let's take this as a reminder to encrypt and backup. Repeat after me, ***encrypt*** and ***backup***.

How can it reduce the impact of the schocks?
@_date: 2012-07-16 23:34:01
Wait a months or two until the price has dropped again, to invest now is not the best time. Speculators are riding the roller coaster.

I dont live in the US, but what kind of a show is it? I watched that episode, and frankly, it seemed quite shitty.
@_date: 2012-08-05 20:53:14
It does not necessarily mean that there is more interest in the currency, only that people want to buy more than they want to sell. 
What is happening not, with the price going from 5 to 11 usd is nothing but a bubble. We who already know about Bitcoin are seeing the price rising and we think "hey! The price is rising, if I buy now I'll earn a lot!". 
That is nice and all, but it's really nothing new and it is not the thing that is marvellous about Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2012-07-29 17:39:52
The gold price may be one of the stabler ones, but it goes up and down that too. 
Would be great if MTgox had a gold reserve so that we could trade btc/gold there! 
@_date: 2012-07-15 20:52:42
Or if anyone pointed a gun at Gavin who has the private key to send a message that appears in every Satoshi bitcoin client, forcing him to link everyone to a malicious update. 
But the thief would not earn to much from it. When it gets out to the public, people will loose trust in the economy and sell, and the more sells, the lower price, and the less the thief earns. 
@_date: 2012-07-10 14:50:53
YES! GREAT!
ALSO: There is a bitcoin stack exchange site. They are great. Newbs should google that. 
@_date: 2012-07-10 08:50:00
Guys, we should all remember that this market goes up and down in very large and swift movements. Sooner than later it will be down to 3-4ish usd/btc, and it will also be &gt;12 usd soon. 
So sit calm when the boat rocks and play safe :).
