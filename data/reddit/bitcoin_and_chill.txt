Bitcoin is not the cause of this bullshit, fiat is. Do you believe that exchanges *are* Bitcoin?

It doesn't directly change how they operate very much.
They operate based on what the mining incentive is. If that incentive stays the same (transaction fees rise from current values by around 20x) then they have the same incentive to do what they are doing now.
Changing mining costs might cause them to mine more or less than currently.
Possibly the predictability of profit might influence their decision to mine more/less, but overall I would say this doesn't influence miners operations.

It isn't obvious to everyone.

If total mining reward drops then so does network security. A high cost of mining 51% of blocks is one of the big forces in preventing a bad actor from usurping the network.
If mining costs drop, then mining hash rate increases. Total mining incentive is what is important here, not the cost to mine.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:10:45
Note that even at 100 MB blocks that fee is currently $0.35.
At 100x current adoption/usage we would need 10000MB blocks to have a $0.35 fee. (It won't really scale linearly like that but this gives us an idea.)
One thing is clear: all transactions cannot occur on chain.
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:50:12
Mining will still have costs when the block reward is 0. The total incentive to mine is what matters.
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:41:40
No, I see it as evidence that all transactions can't occur on chain, even with massive block size increases. That's all.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:12:45
That's a good point but actually the numbers above are conservative when you start taking a couple of orders of magnitude increased adoption (demand for transactions) into account.
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:45:17
Dollar devaluation has nothing to do with this and doesn't affect the outcome.
The point is that current miner incentives *in 2016 dollars* are $75000/hour (minus miner costs). In 2030 or whenever the equivalent dollar amount is what will be of relevance then.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:14:27
12.5 BTC per 10 minutes. That's 12.5 * 6 * $1000 = $75000 per hour.
75000/2000 = $7.50 per transaction.
I made a mistake in OP, reposting it now :(
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:07:52
To put it more simply than my other comment:


No. You don't. 2016 dollars don't change value due to inflation. They are the equivalent value of a dollar in 2016, compared to whatever year you want whether that be 1950 or 2050.
Miners aren't even paid in dollars anyway.
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:04:16
It sounds like wants there to be competition, but the direction we are headed in, there won't be any (for a while, at least).
The 6' 6" 220 lb man can hurt one person, but not a whole nation, and if he could hurt a whole nation, then there is certainly a danger of the government trying to use him for that purpose.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:18:28
If you assume miners pay half of that reward in costs, then it is about $3.25 per transaction.
Even at 10 MB blocks, it is $0.32 per transaction.
If we see 100x adoption then the demand for transactions would put us at 1000-10000MB blocks to have $0.32 fee transactions.
So one thing is clear: all transactions cannot be on chain, if you want some for example, $0.01 fee transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:04:31
It doesn't matter because 2016 dollars are worth the same in the year 2140 or the year 2017. In the year 2140, a 2016 dollar is worth exactly the same amount as a dollar is worth (e.g. how much of a basket of goods it can buy) in 2016. That is why we define a dollar value by year when doing forward/backward looking calculations like these.
We will be doing a calculation in 2140 that goes like "to maintain historical average mining rewards, the fee per transaction has to be X", and X will be something like $7.50 in 2016 dollars (maybe that's $100 in 2140 dollars, so what?).
And by the way, this calculation becomes relevant more like in the year 2030, long before 2140.
So again, dollar devaluation has zero impact here, miners are not going to just accept a small fraction of the purchasing power as an "equivalent" reward just because the dollar devalued. Not to mention that miners are paid in BTC, and not in dollars...

How much more time does it take to generate one random private key and associated bitcoin address, than it takes to attempt one bitcoin hash solution?
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:41:10
It also removes a guard against small BTC transaction spam.
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:18:00
Yes, I was wondering about how (in some general sense) many more multiples of total global hash power (if it could even be applied to key finding, which I know it can't) would be needed to find a desired private key.
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:40:48
If you make the system percentage based, small BTC transactions can be spammed while large BTC transactions will be much more expensive.
Large BTC transactions with a slightly lower fee same size fee used to be prioritized over small BTC transactions (maybe they still are?), since it is easier to flood the network with small BTC transactions.

If you give away your *master* pub key plus one private key then you can derive the master private key.
This is only true for some HD implementations, but you should assume this weakness exists in your HD wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-29 05:53:37
Why not decrease to 0.1MB?
Large blocks have pros and cons.
Small blocks have pros and cons.
Too far in either direction is bad.

That's not what I was asking about or what I was pondering. I know its computationally intractable to find a private key.
@_date: 2016-11-10 16:15:19
His private keys aren't compromised by this actually.
Most likely they could not access his keys ever (unless iOS has a critical flaw in their sandboxing). So it's prudent not to store coins on this device maybe because it isnt worth it to take on this additional risk, but unlikely that he would be allowing his company to have access to these coins.

Restrictions don't help adoption, by defintion. But that doesn't mean adoption won't happen.
Hardware wallets get cheaper and more accessible all the time.

My point is that half of my bandwidth needs can be supported by an LTE cellphone connection, meanwhile [in other threads]( a home 1000GB/month cap connection is being considered "not good enough" for a full node.
So this is just an example of where the lower bound really is.
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:44:55
Keep in mind that most of the bitcoins that will ever be created, have already been created. The supply won't change much. Demand will change far far more than supply.

Did you read the article?
Basically IRS overseer says the IRS is making the rules stupid and fucked up for bitcoin users, and they need to simplify them and treat bitcoin like a currency instead of property, instead of getting in the way of innovation.
Go read the article before commenting.
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:54:28
That is not true.
In blocksonly mode it only uses 4GB month because it is download only.
In full mode it is uploading and using about 40GB/month of bandwidth.
Nodes exist on a scale from all the way full to not at all full, and many benefits can be had even in *blocksonly* mode, where zero uploading is done and the bandwidth usage is 4GB.
The point I'm really trying to make in this post is that there is this conception of nodes needing massive bandwidth and resources and they really dont.
@_date: 2016-11-10 16:17:20
Do you want to mention a reason? Is it just an irrational fear, or that you don't understand how sandboxing works?
I guess you recommend not having bitcoins on any iphone ever, or no iphone that also has another app installed (which is all OP is installing, another app). It's not like his company will be rooting his phone.
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:22:04
It won't affect mining, no.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:58:57
There are multiple ways to limit bandwidth. The whole point of my post is that I'm limited to 40GB.
You could limit to 800GB for example.
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:51:21
Not quite, but close. Sometimes I close it before bed.
Do note that as I said in the OP it is 10GB/month on LTE and 40GB/month total (so 30GB/month is on wifi).
So not it not 24/7 connected to LTE, it does about 25% of its bandwidth consumption through LTE.
I could go to about 70% of the bandwidth through LTE in theory and not go over the cap though, but that is unnecessary for me.
When in *blocksonly* mode absolutely you could run it 24/7 on LTE. This is because it is only about 4.3 GB to download all the blocks in a 1 month period.
@_date: 2016-12-20 00:07:23
My point is that you can data limit your node down to your specific connection limits, which is what I did for my LTE connection. That node of mine uses about 10GB/month on my LTE connection and another 30GB/month on wifi for a total of about 40GB/month total.
Data download is unlimited and data upload is limited by bandwidth tools to 15kb/s up.
So the idea that a 1000GB/month cap is not enough isn't an accurate view.
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:49:22
That's interesting. I have a full node on a cell phone LTE connection with a 28GB monthly data cap (T Mobile).
My node uses about 10 GB/month (I use bandwidth limiting tools).
I also have another node on a 6GB/month data cap LTE plan and it runs in blocksonly mode (so it uses 4GB/month but doesn't upload or keep a copy of the mempool so that one is not a full node).

Miners start signalling for segwit on Nov 15.
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:00:45
It doesn't upload blocks or relay the mempool.
The only thing it uploads is transactions that you send, which is near zero upload (but you're right, not exactly 0).
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:01:17
Well I was uploading something like 18GB/month actually. Not blocks, just mempool relay, but that is still helpful upload activity.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:57:23
Nodes can still sync from other higher bandwidth nodes.
Having lots of low bandwidth full nodes or just blocksonly nodes, still helps the network by increasing the distribution of rule verification and privacy.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:59:59
The whole point of my post is that 1000GB/month is not needed and that users that only have say 500GB/month should be encouraged to run full nodes but use bandwidth limiting tools to stay within their particular limits.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:55:47
No, even blocksonly nodes (nodes that do 0 upload) help the network arguably by distributing rule enforcement and increasing privacy.
Also, I doubt my node has uploaded any blocks at all. Maybe one or two. All the upload is just mempool relaying (which does help the network btw).
@_date: 2016-11-10 20:19:49
Fair although I still see little to no difference between installing the app the OP mentions or installing say, Facebook app on your phone.
The OP's app doesn't have magical permissions or abilities compared to many other common apps out there.


It is equal to or better than bitcoins on an internet connected laptop.
In both cases security is greatly improved with a hardware wallet though.
I think we need to drop this focus on a fear of bitcoins on phones and instead focus on the way that bitcoins on phones can be safe, because actual *use* of bitcoins on phones is best, and can be highly secure with a hardware wallet.


I don't see how or why there is any basis to think this. Facebook app can't monitor your bitcoin activity either for example, no matter how many permissions it asks for.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:58:29
And yet I do. Did you read the OP?
I made this post exactly for comment posts like yours.
1500GB is better, but 40GB/month (what OP says) can work too, and can even help the network.
@_date: 2016-10-21 22:04:31
Sorry for your loss.
Let this be a warning to any reading this that using Windows to store your bitcoins without a hardware wallet (or a second multisig machine for spending authorization) is a really bad idea.
