Can't wait to see what happens when the bull market shows up
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:25:02
What will it take for people to learn?

If you still keep your Bitcoin on an exchange after this, you're asking for it.

But prices haven't been down since 2019 started... possibly even up slightly
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:58:03
no it didn't...

I saw some of the crypto influencers on Twitter arguing about that, but I'm not exactly sure... it's an important questions though

TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:32:35
Yes, I should have

Someone forgot to buy the dip ����‍♂️

It's not FUD. Whether those machines are new or old doesn't matter, I'm trying to make the point that Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment will lower costs for miners as hash rate drops. It's genius, really.

Nope, the survey is meant to be asked to only the users of a particular product. Crypto twitter is perhaps the best possible proxy for Bitcoin users.

BCH blocks have a max capacity of 8mb actually. But it's not comparing max capacities, it's comparing block sizes.
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:38:01
That's right
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:25:26
Haha that's actually a good point \- can't stop, won't stop baby!!!

Not sure how to find their address (I'm sure someone on here knows how to do that), but their holdings are listed on their website

This date range was picked because April 1 was the last full day before the current bull run began.

Also, despite the best attempts of mainstream media - Bitcoin still isn't dead. It's stronger than ever.
