Can I use leveraged trading on Gatecoin ?
At the moment, it is not possible to use leverage on Gatecoin. We plan on adding leveraged trading soon.

I've used a fair number of FIAT exchanges in Canada, EU, far east, and Kraken always seems to be the slowest for transfers, the most expensive for fees, and has the worst interface by a long shot. On top of that their customer service flatters to deceive when they get in contact, i.e. appear promising but ultimately disappoints. 
Less exchanges also means less avenues for multiple deposits and withdrawals. So yeh :(

I...I would want to see this just for the chaos
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:38:13
you can try quoine.com They are based in Singapore and have no trading fees. I've been using them for a few months now and seem pretty solid. free to register and have a look around.

@_date: 2016-12-07 12:50:55
have look at coinfloor
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:07:25
or downfall?
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:00:38
No they still haven’t credited the BCH. I won’t be crediting anymore bitcoin after this B2x nonsense 
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:48:45
Thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:14:16
Ill wait for my BCH, convert/spend that, then look for a different card. Fucking idiots..

A number of folks think the number of transactions in a block is directly correlated to the price of bitcoin. Bigger blocks = more transactions = higher price of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:17:43
Very disappointing. Transferring out and uninstalling as are my friends and colleagues, 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:07:36
Have you tried bitsquare? think it’s called bisq now. Decentralised exchange. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:28:44
I would get this but '2.4G/ 150M/ 802.11g/n'. That's just grim.

Welcome to the real world, everyone is generalised everyday, judged ever 20 seconds, and spoon fed shit like overtime and 50 hour weeks weeks with sugary sweetners like zero interest payment consumer products. Welcome to the shittiest part of this planets existence for under 30s. Although the london smog days were probably no good ;)

Paycash is for EU residents who hold US funds. They are suspicious
@_date: 2016-07-12 09:43:09
with USD?
@_date: 2016-07-12 09:42:50
HSBC has great brand recognition too but will you trst them more than other bank like santander? Ok now I answer your question. customer support, timely withdrawals and deposits, fast responses on why deposits or transfers are not on time. Natural email communication that doesn't sound like robot. Actual telephone numbers and addresses. Cant think of much else

I'm with you brother, voted leave and now moving back to the UK. FYI I have  been a resident paying all my taxes.

Just FYI for Canadians 
If you're going to be lending BTC on Poloniex you will get better APR at ANY non credit union bank where your balance is over 1 million CAD

Kraken uses PayCash. what a fucking joke. when there is a problem it's NEVER kraken's problem. they just say, oh it's paycash'. People should stop using Kraken immediately until they have an actual support team tats not a middle man
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:27:27
I took a dump and it didn't stick to any of the sidewalls. Bitcoin price definitely on the up
@_date: 2016-07-17 08:22:37
Wagecan seems to be the best of the bunch. Terrible name but everything else about it seems reasonable. If anyone is using it I would love to know more about its spot fee structure. A friend and I are looking to order them by the end if the month

no, Just Krkaen is the bitch

your facts sound like shitposting. My facts are based on evidence over time. but hopium is something you can smoke as much as you want
@_date: 2016-07-12 09:38:44
ok man, I'll defer to your judgement, but after th nexst (last) transaction I use then for I will not use the again unless improvements are made across the board. peace
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:13:10
Stopped using Cavirtex even before they were bought by Kraken. Vogogo is a joke and their fees are absurd. Quadriga has been nothing but plain sailing for me on withdrawals and deposits. 
Sorry to hear you are having issues with Quadriga

@_date: 2016-07-11 20:58:14
it means you accept that payin rent is normal,
it means you accept the idea of never being able to pay off your mortgage  and grandfather it to your children/family. it means your understanding of currentncys is
below bachelor level. it means something else probably bit I'm wasted right now and your rational stupid Reddit thinking is just making me fucking laugh

@_date: 2016-07-12 05:39:25
no, quadrigacx is amazing. Bitbay is amazing, quoine is not so amazing but better than kraken. It's just kraken that is so fucking shit. oh and coinfloor is amazing too.
