This one is a pulsed fiber laser. Galvos/mirrors direct the beam so it's different than how an epilog works.

Mostly used in manufacturing for traceability - medical places engrave tools &amp; artificial joints, car companies put date codes and barcodes on parts and bearings and stuff, lots of gun places use them for engraving logos and serial numbers. 
If you have nice cookware then its name is probably engraved w/a  laser on the bottom.

In the video it's anodized aluminum.
It looks better on steel plates, especially if you anneal instead of burn, but it takes much longer.

Good job. What are your plans for it?
I got a little bit of bitcoin today and I'm pretty excited. I had to make a video (twice) for coin.mx to verify my identity!!! It was pretty demeaning, but I guess it's worth it. 
If I had one bitcoin, I would probably try to buy a glock, or maybe car parts. I remember when all you could buy with bitcoins was some llama wool socks or something. 
I don't remember but I think I installed the bitcoin miner but then got busy &amp; lost interest. Sux, hopefully I didn't have like 5000 bitcoins mined.

Yea, most are shielded but this one is class 4 (so it's not shielded) and you need to have laser safety goggles on, which I did. You'll go blind immediately if somehow the beam gets in your eyes.
I am not the best at figuring out the frequencies and speeds to get the perfect mark, but someone who knows what they're doing can get really beautiful results - on nice mirrored steel they can even make the lasers anneal with different colors.

Thx for the tip.

Also, check out new orleans bitcoin exchange, they mark actual coins which look really nice.
