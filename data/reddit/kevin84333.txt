Yea, because all you liberals is resist, thats it. And you want free healthcare, UBI and free college? States like NY, CA, WA, highest taxed state in the country?

Hey, I voted for Trump
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:14:40
We will definitely be going down to 6k or even lower. It's part of the 5th wave theory for crypto. Probably in a couple of weeks.
@_date: 2018-09-08 02:58:32
That's because it was the whales that manipulate the market and use the fake news to make you believe it was that brought the price down.
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:49:08
Right now support is 6400, I don't think it will hold so next will be 5800 support and after 5k. I think it will go down so I'm waiting.
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:39:06
Why you say that?
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:12:13
Sure I'm confident in my analysis.
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:40:38
5500 is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-08-13 01:53:19
Bullrun starts tomorrow: day 154.
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:27:09
short answer
@_date: 2018-08-08 04:25:00
Bitcoin is hitting 100k next year.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:30:19
You don't lose anything if you don't sell, so HODL.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:30:20
Why do you say 4500 is bottom?
@_date: 2018-08-08 04:28:11
If Bitcoin is not refundable then how can we expect a adoption to rise if people get scam when buying?
@_date: 2018-08-29 06:14:14
Bitcoin will be 1 million in 2021, not 2020.
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:47:25
I see 100k in 2019 actually.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:43:22
if it gets rejected at 7200 I am looking at 6k
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:35:48
I'm feeling very bearish
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:37:33

@_date: 2019-02-05 05:33:20
What the next crypto I should invest after bitcoin that will have bigger gains? And when id rick and morty season 3 coming? Who is the democratic nominee in 2020? What happens to BAKKT?
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:02:22
Litecoin is. performing increase nearly 20%
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:11:51
Your right I paid all those things since I can't avoid them, I just didn't pay any crypto earnings last year.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:07:27
Fuck irs and taxes. I hate paying them, I didn't pay any last year as I did a loophole.
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:43:56
I see it hitting 100k in 2019. I will only sell some, because price of bitcoin will increase every year.
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:39:30
Same, had to sell some to pay credit card debt.
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:18:45
Arba is the alternative free and no fees expect when you buy using credit cards  (american express is only supported right now)
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:45:11
Arba is what you want. No fees except when you buy with credit card, only American express is accepted right now.
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:21:05
Arba is also a good alternative to coinbase, no fees except when you  use a credit cards and they only accept american express. I hated that coin base kept raising fees. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:33:20
This is good, my earnings are increasing, made 500 dollars of my investing just today. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:47:22
I bet you regret not investing earlier?
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:59:58
100k Bitcoin is coming end of year.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:47:14
If it drops to 1k I don't think Bitcoin recovers
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:02:19
Or now
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:01:58
Bears are taking control.
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:52:20
Today is 1 year since Bitcoin went to 20k. A bull run is coming over everyone.
