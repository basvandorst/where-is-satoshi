Definitely good news for the business.  I guess it is the purchaser that is paying transaction fees?  Help me understand.

When the apocalypse comes you would be better served to have large stores of brass and lead, fiat and bitcoin will both be useles.

I get that on cc/debit.  My question was more about the bitcoin fees for processing a transaction.

There is a point where it goes from being “buying the dip” to “catching a falling knife”.

It is gambling for sure.  The main argument is that the USD is “fiat” so there is nothing backing it.  There is the ability of the US government to take all your shit backing it.  There is literally nothing backing a bitcoin, except more people wanting in.  But but but there is a finite amount, I call bullshit on that too.  Want more of them?  Create some fake drama and “fork” the currency.  Now you have created more.  I think blockchain itself will be something transformational in the future, but when grandma is sitting around the holiday table asking how to buy it that is when you know the dumb money has arrived and it’s time to get out.

The market can stay illogical much longer than you can remain solvent.  Timing the market rarely works.  Case in point was US stocks when Trump got elected.  Talking heads were all talking about a market crash, it’s up huge since his election.  I personally know a few people that were going to cash out their 401ks in anticipation, glad they didn’t.
