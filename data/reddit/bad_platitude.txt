ok bitcoin fanboys: silver and gold have intrinsic value because they can and are used in various domestic and industrial applications.
i'll keep stacking silver and gold and you idiots can keep stacking your arcade coins.  it's only worth what someone is willing to trade for it.  
bitcoin's fatal flaw is its convertibility.
@_date: 2013-02-27 16:55:36
you're the one projecting.  
just keep stacking your arcade coins, i'll put my bennybux into something that actually has enduring value.

**No independent verifications of balances.**
ponzi scheme much? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:04:07
guess it won't be selling then.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:06:11
you're new to economics, apparently.
@_date: 2013-02-20 16:51:53
@_date: 2013-03-15 22:31:17
uhhh, yeah... i'll stick to my gold and silver.
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:52:31
ummm. are you guys seriously talking about technicals and *bitcoins*?  SMH.
let's revisit reality for a second:  **bitcoin has no intrinsic value.**
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:59:15
bitchcoin is a far cry from gold.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:57:50
the crash is gonna be epic.
@_date: 2013-02-27 14:17:18
The moment bitcoin's convertability to dollars changes for whatever reason is the moment its value goes to nil - unlike gold and silver.  And given the direction the economic state of the US, it's an investment I'd never take seriously.  
So keep downvoting, jerkfaces. It's the best you're gonna do in lieu of an argument. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:04:06
it's a pathetic response to an obviously heavily manipulated 'currency'.
**though bitcoin investors like to pretend it's not.**
this is the very best they could do today.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:29:35
oooh, told me to google ambiguous, 'laughable' points? 
do something useful instead and buy silver. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:11:34
bitcoin is a manipulated market, contrary to what many bitcoiners have been preaching for the last month.
How does the Fed destroy bitcoin?   
1. You create thousands upon thousands of small little 'dummy' accounts of varying incremental sizes...
2. You print [fiat] money to fund all these little accounts &amp; send the money you printed out of thin air to Mt. Gox
3. Bid Bid Bid Bid for a couple of straight weeks [whilst others are sucked in]
4. At the proper moment... ALGO sell everything [followed by similar buy programs at conceivable STOP levels]... You're trading against yourself...
You don't give a flying fuck if your DUMMY accounts are getting commissioned &amp;/or losing value... It's all PLAY money to you cause you printed it out of thin air...
Not to others though... A couple of days of this &amp; real people will have had it with bitcoin... Even if they hang in there, MERCHANTS won't touch it with a 10 foot pole... You're back to the dark ages of the nether regions of the Silk Road... Sure ~ bitcoin still survives... but it never catches on in a mainstream commercial sense... Especially since there is no legal avenue for you to take your complaints...
@_date: 2013-03-01 17:06:52
oh, ok, it's not a ponzi.
just wait until that moment when the banking industry deems it a threat and renders it no longer convertible to fiat.  
you bittoken fans will be crushed the minute it becomes big enough to pose any kind of threat to the western fiat hegemony.
but i seriously don't care if you don't take my word for it. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:57:54
it's just you.
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:49:12
i don't give a fuck about r/bitcoin downvotes or your carnival bitchcoins.
**btc = electronic fiat.**  one day it will be exploited and/or shutdown.  but again, if you didn't believe this or that didn't strike a nerve, why bother replying?
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:06:08
first, yes.
second, no, it was you who climbed up on my nuts, or have you already forgotten?
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:57:27
it's only a matter of time before your carnival token is reverse engineered.  and with all the attention it's getting, that won't be long.
but don't take my word for it.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:18:38
Bitcoin is a perfect vehicle for money laundering.
the problem with reddit is all people can do when they don't have a viable argument is downvote.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:33:07
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:14:13
here's the part where I act surprised.  
don't think for a minute your tokens will continue to escape the evil grasp of the global banking cartel.  not that i support that.
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:06:07
in reality, you understand very little, or you would have picked apart each bullet point.  now bugger off, flea.

BitCoin is:
-   Backed by nothing, created out of thin air;
-   Managed by algos, protected by algos, accessed by algos;
-   Traded in a small online market and difficult to convert to actual goods/services;
-   Dominated by a few large anonymous holdings with unknown intent;
-   Likely monitored by a variety of "interested third parties" that are known by various 3-letter acronyms;
-   "Mined" by computers at a predetermined rate to keep supply growing (still backed by nothing);
-   Limited in total production, **they promise!**; and,
-  The best known digital currency at this point, but subject to new competitors, gov't oversight and other unknown factors.
LOAD UP WHILE IT'S HOT!!!

too bad most reddiots voted for the obamney brand.
@_date: 2013-01-25 04:03:54
you jokers do realize bitcoin is completely contingent on internet access?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:08:26
suckers.  didn't see this one coming ten miles away or anything.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:32:25
throw bitchcoin on the shitpile along with gold and silver.
this is what 'free' markets look like.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:57:34
if you want to take down the banks, buy silver.
don't think that your carnival tokens will stay under the radar forever.
@_date: 2013-02-27 17:06:01
oh ok, because we live in a society even remotely close to one 100,000 years ago.
you've convinced me to go 'all-in' to bitcoin. 
i'll repeat it again since you bitcoin worshippers don't seem to get it:
you're all depending on:
the reliability of the network
-and- 
the convertability to another medium of exchange.  
in the face of these ever increasing uncertainties, i will keep stacking real metal, something with true value, gold and silver.  bitcoin undeniably has the ability to go to zero value, gold and silver do not.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:49:55
don't take it so personally, especially if i don't take your disjointed sentences as reality.
i suggest you pour all your assets into BTC ASAP.
@_date: 2013-02-19 20:51:51


bitcoin is not actively manipulated daily as silver is.  
apples, meet oranges.
@_date: 2013-03-14 00:13:15
Gold has been money for almost 5000 years
Fiat paper, off and on for a few hundred years
Bitcoin has been a currency for a couple of years
If confidence is an issue, I see only one bet worth taking
@_date: 2013-03-19 19:10:58
here's one: dump your carnival tokens and buy silver.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:05:11
the only thing i like about bitcoin is it represents how metals should look if they weren't massively manipulated.
the best thing about PMs is that the 'market' keeps the price manipulated downwards, so I can buy more virtually every month.
BTC is a guinea pig to TPTB, which I am sure will react at some point.  it will provide some nice insight into what will happen when they lose control of metals.
