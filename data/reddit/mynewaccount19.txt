If you care about day to day gains you are going to be sad a lot.

Last time it dropped like this, around 2 months ago, I did $100 at $9k, $100 at $8k, and $100 at $7k. Never invest everything at once

He has an empty address. BTW in linked article, how could that woman prove loss? How does IRS know she didn't just send it to her friend in another country and its sitting there waiting for her?

You may be able to save a lot on taxes, talk to an accountant.

Based on your comments yes. But you posted this an hour ago, good luck freaking out every day until you sell at the worst time!

Can you really prove any loss? I mean CC loss you could be working with the criminals and gotten a %. Cash loss? Yeah right.

I was mining litecoin on a $1000 rig when it was $3 each. DIdn't made much, sold the 3 GPUs. I got 2 ltc a day when I ran it. I sold them immediately for the profit. I could have had $150-300 a day of mining if I mined and HODL

Wire transfer? Cash? It's not different. It's just as provable as any of those methods. BTW merchants losing $1mil to fraud on CC is a tax deduction. Can IRS prove fraudulent profits weren't sent to another country to someone associated with merchant? Nope.
