Yeah, the hardware wallet option is really not worth it unless you are holding 1k or more

I predict a lot of people are just assuming the IRS won't come after them, but it's not a good assumption.

agreed, but as a gift cash is also the least personal and meaningful

good point on "springing it" on recipients.  I think my group are pretty tech savy and some of them invest online may even have some bitcoin already.  I feel pretty confident it would go over well based on the people in my group (although its also possible that one of themhas taken an "anti
 bitcoin stance"  that you see from i would estimat 50% general population in comment sections so i guess its a little risky, maybe i can not to obviously ask them their thoughts on it first)  
also is there a vendor you would recommend?  I see   but that's just the one who has the best SEO.

I agree. I suggest May 24th 2014, just because its my wedding day, and i am giving my groomsmen bitocoin.  hoping the $50 each i bought is worth more by then!

I would guesstimate 2-3 years, probably some small tech school like fullsail or other that needs media will do something like that as a techy publicity stunt.
Mainstream unys like NYU?  I would guess 5 years min..

I am giving out paper wallets filled with  bitcoin to my groomsmen at my wedding. I think they will like it even if none of them would have gone through the legwork to get the BTC  originally. Once some has (x) vlaue they will figure out how to use it.   I suggest more people use btc as gift (to younger gen at least) to help spread adoption.

To piggy back on the paper wallet question, if I wanted to give out 0.1 btc as a paper wallet gift to 5 different people, how does this work. Can I buy 0.5 btc and "split" it up myself? Or do I need to by the 0.1 BTC separately so i can have  a separate adress/private key for each paper wallet?

What if I could set up automatic payments of any increment, to any number of accounts of my choosing. Oh wait, I can.  Try doing that through BOA or a credit union.  Tell them you want to make a payment of $7.50 into 7 accounts (your college buddies) every time your football team wins. Good luck. They would laugh at you.
What are you really paying them for (your bank or credit union or credit card/line of credit) , do they really let you do whatever you want with YOUR money? What fees do they charge?
The key thing is I should be able to make transactions of my choosing without a central authority. 
I know if you are not a programmer you can't really use Bitcoin like those of us who can write code, but we can make it easier for you. You will get it someday, probably soon.

You say the past can be a poor predicter of the future then launch into a cliche tulip example. 
Bitcoin is nothing like tulips, its more like 1890 oil. Volitil and increasing rapidly over a long period of time.

Whoosh. The ex. was to show that the possibilities are endless, not as a mass appeal use case. You still don't get it. You will . IMO I have had so many amazing application ideas that run into a wall at (I can't control my payment structure, I am at the whim of large corporations here. Their (big banks) payment options are limited and lack innovation.  There is a ton of psychology reseach on money as insentive for things like bad habit (quiting smoking, losing weight, etc...) 
 I am an investor in alt coins, agree with you the blockchain goes beyond Bitcoin. Peercoin is my jam, proof of stake solves the energy issue. 
I use proof of stake and minting for long term (10+ year cold storage) and Bitcoin/ETH/LItcoin for short term storage(5 years storage) .  
I don't keep a ton of cash around.   If something were to happen where I needed cash for an emergency I am at whim of bank again. I was in a foreign country once and the ATM was not working.  Having  &gt;1k BTC for emergency and food or travel or lodging)  is another thing I love about it. Gold is unusable, has less utility than BTC.

It's much much more attractive than cash/credit cards once you understand it. For example, it's almost infinitely **fungible**.  When my daughter needs to do something I can pay her almost any amount.  Maybe it's .0005 BTC per homework problem. That is my power as a currency owner, I can create increments of my choosing and even create smart contracts without going to a bank.
I could never give my daughter 1/3 micro ounces  of Gold per problem, without rounding up at the end and needing a goldsmith. It's just better and the way the future will work. Make it easier for us to do what we want with our money.
