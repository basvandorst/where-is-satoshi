What makes you think it goes below $100?  Any data point in particular?

Their lack of transparency and potential insolvency when/if withdrawals are allowed make the amount they are making in fees more relevant to those who are owed coins and fiat.

Hard to say but I think insolvency drives price up because a lot of the fear feels like it is priced in.

Some Gox withdrawal stats

This is pure trading fees.  I couldn't find enough data to estimate currency conversion fees.

Due to deposit and withdrawal delays and I don't think Gox is a viable exchange for arbitrage. So post BTC withdrawal fix any BTCs or fiat left in Gox would be siloed with minimal impact in the market. 
It is also hard for me not to think the approx 15k - 20k BTC flowing out of Gox to other exchanges won't put significant pressure on price.

If they allow BTC withdrawls I would imagine account holders would transfer them to their wallets or other exchanges and not sell them to other users on Gox.  That would be counterintuitive.

Gox being insolvent because of incompetence or a ponzi doesn't mean btc is any more or less viable, it is a buyer beware about the exchange you choose to use. The coins and fiat presumed to be there would not come to market and have less impact on price. It might be a contrarian view but I think having the situation resolved would help confidence in btc and you would see more buying occur.

Good point but wouldn't the increased price be contained to Gox because it is unlikely for others to transfer BTC or fiat in. And the BTC flowing out would most likely drive down prices at other exchanges.

I actually think if they are insolvent the price will go up.  No BTC flowing out and the uncertainty of their solvency is already priced in.  Eliminating the speculation might end up soothing the market.

Typo on my part. Apologies.

It is a best guess. Pretty clear about that. Have another estimate, approximation, or assumption? Feel free to share it.
