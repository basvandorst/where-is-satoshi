He is actually correct.  During the midevil period there was a legion of squires who roamed around Scotland carry massive bagpipes.  They are where the term bagholder originated.  
They where known as the quire.  Many people and potential wives would try to convince via preaching to the quire men to sell their bags, and settle down.  They did not see the point of roaming around in a forest playing bagpipes. 
Hence the term, preaching to the quire was coined.

We did 800 Billion in QE (immediate inflation) 7 or 8 years ago.   
We did massive tax decreases for Fortune 500 sized companies a few years ago.  Those smart guys took all the newfound capital and bought their stock back pushing up the "value" of their companies.  
It was thought they might use that money to hire new workers and increase wages.  Haha!

I should have said the original Bitcoin code.  Not copies, not forks, etc.  Network effect is very relevant with competing tech, and code in general. 
The original code design for Bitcoin has immense value, and has been playing out in front of our eyes over the past 9 years.
I see a lot of value in that code.  It has built a massive ecosystem.  Originally built on nothing but code.  I'm sure many won't agree with my viewpoint on that, and that's fine.

Great response Mr Economist.  I only made two point's, so not sure why someone who wrote a couple endless paragraphs an hour ago couldn't respond.

Please explain to me how traditional currencies are a great store of value over time?  That's exactly what you said.  I think it's completely false, and the one reason you listed previously to back this claim, has been proven false many times throughout history.

That could be a matter of perspective.  But here goes.  
The most obvious difference between gambling and investing is that gambling does not have loss prevention.  The bet is immediately settled.  It's either black or red.  I either doubled my money, or have zero.
With investing you can DCA, or simply cash out and walk away, with more than zero.

There is no taxable event until you sell your Bitcoin.  If you are retired when you sell, you pay zero taxes on your Bitcoin profits if it's under a threshold.  I believe it is currently 35,000 dollars annually in the US.

You're leaking Mr Economist.  
"BTC has a terrible track record as a store of value".
Actually it's been the best performing store of value since it's creation.  Out performing all of the traditional store of values recommended by "economists".
You also go on to claim how currencies are a great store of value over time, because despite their loss of purchasing power over time, agents can react by simply earning more currency to increase their purchasing power. 
This is absolutely false.   Currencies have all failed.  Decades long recessions have hit economies, ruining the agents of all purchasing power, and any hope of out pacing the inflation by simply trying to earn more currency.  A currency alone is ALWAYS a terrible store of value.
Prior to Bitcoin, there has never been a viable option to have a store of value and medium exchange, that could also become a standard unit of account.  Thousands of years ago there would be issues with a currency doing that based on communication and logistics alone. 
More recently, even the mighty USD has shown that it just won't work as a standardized unit of account in a global economy.  Because it is centralized.  
In order for agents, and states, to be able to peg their own currency and assets to a standard unit of account, that unit of account must be free from the whims of a potentially opposing government. 
That is why Bitcoin will force your Macro and Micro books to be rewritten.  There has never been anything like Bitcoin prior, and it is absolutely going to change the way the world views stores of value, currency, units of account, and inflation.

Sure.  
Some people suffering from COPD, stomach or lung cancer, cannot afford the prescriptions used to treat the side effects of the chemo, or the cancer itself.  This includes pain, lack of appetite, vomiting, anxiety, and trouble sleeping.
Many of these patients use herbal medicines to treat those issues.  For someone suffering from lung cancer, who does not have access or cannot afford prescribed medicinal marijuana in an oil form, they can use our formula to safely ingest marijuana.
Since the last thing a lung cancer patient would want to do is roll up a joint or smoke from a pipe, they simply mix our formula with a herbal concentrate, and they can safely vape it.  They can also use our formula to make a tincture to drink or ingest their herbal medicine.  
The cancer patients utilizing our formula can safely use our product anywhere they like, their is zero smell.  Despite the US becoming much more lenient on medicinal marijuana, there is still a stigmata associated with "pot smokers".  Since many cancer patients are older and tend to be more conservative,  many of them want their medicinal marijuana use to be private.
The formula is called DBmixPro.  To be honest,  the majority of the people who use our product are college kids wanting to get stoned in public or at a concert. We realized that pretty early on and primarily market to that demographic. Gotta pay the bills. 
I didn't create anything that is going to save lives or change the world, but the formula really does help some people battling cancer or other diseases, and for me that is pretty gratifying.

Not sure what country you are in, but in the US a buyer is responsible for hiring a lawyer to process the closing documents, and actually make the payment to the seller.
If you were just using fiat, your check would be made to the lawyer, not the seller.  Perhaps you can find a lawyer who will accept your Bitcoin, and then write a check to the seller. 
The lawyers bank would be used to him making large fiat deposits into his bank, so that would not raise eyebrows.  There are many OTC exchanges the lawyer could use.  
Not sure if this helps any, as finding a lawyer to accept the BTC is perhaps as difficult as finding a seller offering a house you like for BTC.

Just answer this one question.  Where does it say on your website that for an individual miner wanting to mine it is not profitable given the current difficulty rating, semi annual new hardware releases, and cost of electricity? 
You dont.  You lead people on to think they are going to make a return on their investment, when they are not.  It would be, it would have been, and will most likely always be more profitable to buy your coins upfront and hold.  That is true for 99 percent of your customers. 
"Genesis Mining, for when you just want to lose less, instead of nothing at all".
One more time for you.  Your whole fucking business model and marketing is geared towards scamming noobs into buying worthless mining contracts that 99 percent of the time will lose money.  
Congrats, way to leave your mark.

So you should tell your potential customers, you will lose a lot of money trying to run 1 rig on your own, so hand us your money and you will lose less.  
You all know very well the contracts are never profitable in any fucking sense of logic or reality.  
Your company scams people out of Bitcoin for having them reinvest into shitty contracts that will never generate a profit. 
It's a fucking joke for anyone who understands Bitcoin.  Your company is ripping off newcomers into our community. So congrats, your business model is to sell people Bitcoin mining contracts that will never be profitable when compared to buying Bitcoin directly.
So why not add that this statement to your site?  "Genesis Mining contracts will never be profitable when directly compared to buying Bitcoin from one of these reputable exchanges".  Then include links to exchanges that will hopefully not rip off our beloved noobs.  
And to say rewrite the whole website to add a couple sentences?   Come on, seriously?   I guess the pages are just loaded up with too many scam contracts for some integrity and honesty.

If your miner is a year old it will still sell for a few hundred bucks on eBay.  That helps you try to get a ROI.

If they were doing everything they can then their advertisement on their website would clearly tell users that they will lose Bitcoin investing I n your cloud mining contracts.   
Genesis Mining does not advertise that.  Instead they lead people to believe they will make a good return in either fiat value or Bitcoins for these contracts.  Neither are true.  
They encourage customers to reinvest the scraps of Bitcoins Genesis sends to them into more unprofitable contracts.  That's just a flat out scam.  
Genesis Mining is lying by omission at the very least.  It is fraudulent and I hope the newcomers to our community can be forewarned.

Ok, you are crazy.  The headline of the page you sent a screen shot of says, "Why it's more profitable to mine with Genesis Mining". 
That's a fucking misleading statement trying to entice noobs to buy your worthless cloud contracts.  It's scammer marketing.  It is in no way more profitable.  It's burning less money.  That's all it is.
The majority of your customers do not own a mining rig, so your claims you are helping some poor innocent first time miners to save money is a lie.  It's a marketing gimmick created to sell contracts that are only profitable for your company, never the customer.
Any more screen shots of your scammer misleading blatant lies marketing?

The safest way to invest in a volatile asset would be through dollar cost averaging.  Divide the 1950 you almost lost to GenScam by 12, and make 1 purchase a month. Be sure to secure your moon tickets in an offline wallet you control the keys to.

If you want Bitcoin to be around for your descendants,  then we cannot ever compromise on a threat of centralization. 
It's been said here a million times why increasing the blocksize in an irrational way will lead to miner control of the protocol, and decreased node counts. 
We cannot, and hopefully will not, allow the ignorance and ego of common day people to steer a software development project.  BU code has not been properly tested or peer reviewed, and at this time is not safe.
It's like watching monkeys trying to feck a football.   We cannot compromise the integrity and security of Bitcoin's protocol, ever.  We cannot compromise Bitcoin's decentralization, ever.  
I personally hope that however this plays out, the miners will never try to block what the majority of the users and devs prefer in the future,  but I'm an optimist.

In 20 years everything can be automated.  Utilizing protocol and energy, for work.   These machines will need payments for said energy. Fractions of a penny for some tasks.

Eventually BTC will trade like Forex.  People will still invest to diversify their investments.  It will be much less risky, so less potential rewards.

They are losing, any time you trade your Bitcoin for a quickly declining national fiat, you are risking losses both short and long term.
The purpose of the post is speculation that hodlers from other areas outside of China are buying.  True China is paid daily for spending billions on mining, and thus mining, but those of us hedging against floundering national fiat currencies will reap the largest benefits from them "selling to cheap daily".
Ultimately, when they are using their their massive mining facilities to mine and not hoard, it is sacrificing very large long term gains for small minuscule short term gains.  Does this sound familiar?  It is the mind sight of the Chinese manufacturing industry, and the Yuan devaluation.   Every industry in China is a rat race to gobble up market share while making very small profits.  Chinese trading exchanges for example.
They are doing our network and the community a great benefit now, in the present, and as a hodler I truly appreciate it.  They are a part of our free market. Bitcoin needs to be secure first and foremost, and between all the devs and miners out there, it currently is.  I would also like to take the time to thank all of our ancestors who created central banks and the debt based monetary system.  Thanks for not evolving.
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:36:44
Correct.  
I think in 20 years, when the vast majority of Bitcoins have been mined and are being hodled in bulk, while at the same time being used for micro transactions, China will own less than 5 percent.   They are going to mine and sell themselves out of coins quickly, all the while securing one of the most useful protocols ever designed.  Both for machines and humanity over the next century. 
Again,  I'm merely speculating,  as I do daily with hopes I see tomorrow.

Sure skippy.  
The collapse of the wave function, also know as a reduction of the wave packets, means that particles can have many quantum states.
During early physics studies this was usually attributed to measurements being taken that altered the state of particle.  Now we have particle accelerators and can  see spontaneous radioactive decay to create particles in multiple quantum states.
Einstein acknowledged the collapse of the wave function, but was not a fan.  Much to the dislike of many physicists,  it is part of the quantum theory.

When you are talking about guarding a private key, I don't think being overly cautious is ever bad.
Your statement is perfect proof.  "Non - volatile memory gets erased quickly".  Quickly?  I'm not familiar with that being a scientific term, or a term used in mathematics. 
My statement was 100 percent accurate.  Printers store data.  Just because I can't retrieve the data, doesn't mean someone else cannot.   And why would anyone trust an HP printer to guard their data, and hope it erases sensitive data "quickly"?
If there are forensic tools already in existence that can unravel and put together deleted data from a hard drive,  why trust the printer?

That's simply not true.  With LN users will have the option to be their own bank by running a full node and payment channel.
I cannot be my own bank in my country.   Too much legislation and the cost to start a bank is absurdly high.  
I understand all users won't have the knowledge to run a node, but at least they have the option.  Also, if a user doesn't have enough BTC to open a payment channel on LN, then that same user won't have a problem trusting someone else's payment channel, because they are making small purchases and transfers to begin with.

The greatest gift Bitcoin has given me is knowledge and awareness.  Bitcoin forced me to spend several years fully understanding how my country's debt based economy works.

Printers store data when you print text.
There is no guarantee your private key will be deleted from your printer.
Printers are easily hacked if they are ever connected online, just like your computer.  See the link below for proof. 
You said printers don't save data initially.  False.
You said they erase data quickly, whatever the fuck that means.  
You said printers can't be hacked.  False.  
I don't think you know what you are talking about,  and you have supplied zero proof of anything you said.   Keep trusting your printer to guard your keys.   Also, just because your printer deletes data does not mean forensic tools cannot retrieve it.  
Here is proof that printers,  just like most other devices connected to the internet, can and will be hacked.

It seems your creativity is muddled down.  Perhaps I can infuse your brain with some ideas.  Layer 2 solutions are seeking to establish instant micro transactions.  This has been sought after since Bitcoin's initial creation.  
You want disruption?  Despite the obvious forms Bitcoin presents us; deflationary currency, store of value, financial inclusion,  etc, layer 2 is the chance for machine to machine autonomous payments.  
Why is this disruptive?   Have you ever driven by the headquarters of the Department of Transportation in your state, or country?  They are giant buildings filled with offices of paper pushers.  This is hugely inefficient,  and could be performed by software.  The state could have a one story data center filled with servers that outsource all data storage, data entry, and form processing to a company that has developed it's own software to handle these tasks for government agencies and businesses. 
I know, making the government and large corporations more efficient isn't all that great, so what else could instant micro Bitcoin machine to machine payments do?  Fucking everything.   
Self driving cars is any obvious starting point.  Self driving cars will be able to pull into gas stations to refuel at a pump on their own.  They will need a form of payment.  Something instant, something secure.  
When a self driving car picks up a passenger to taxi, what form of payment can it receive that is instant, digital, and cannot be counterfeited?
Want to know what future delivery men will look like?  Drones.  Recently a man ordered a burrito from a fast food restaurant miles away with a drone.  It carried cash in a bag with a note.  A human had to fly the drone.  A human then had to read the note.  A human had to verify the cash was correct,  and not counterfeit.  In the future this process will not need the human.  
Ok I know, machine to machine payment still probably seems kind of lame.  Where's the disruption?   I personally think it isn't one killer app or concept, it's the entirety of it as a whole. 
Everything, minus humans, is getting "smarter".  Everything is communicating via software and code.   Machine to machine micro payments will allow Bob's solar panel roof to automatically sell electricity to his neighbor Alice's Tesla charger whenever it has an abundance.  Alice's Tesla charger will be "smart" enough to check other rates from similar neighbors,  and purchase the cheapest electricity it needs to charge her Tesla.
These are just a few examples of what's coming.  The efficiency machines provide over humans is highly disruptive.  Finally, you specifically asked why Bitcoin's platform?
Bitcoin is the first digital crypto currency that solved the double spend problem.   Bitcoin is decentralized.   Any form of payment process that is not decentralized and used at a large scale will be hacked.  If any business is going to base it's model on developing software to enable machine to machine payments, it has to be secure.  
If Layer 2 software can enable micro machine to machine payments, the autonomous industrial revolution is officially under way.   This is disruptive,  and this will change many things in our every day life.
I will leave you with my favorite disruptive quote. "Hi, my names Bitcoin,  and I'm here to fuck shit up".

Sorry,  but I think most of your points are inaccurate and outdated.  They were much more relevant 5 years ago.  All investments are risky, so is walking out your front door each morning.  You never know when an Acme piano may fall on your head.
I will address your common points used to label Bitcoin as risky.
Small market cap?  50 billion is not small.  
51% attack.  It would be extremely difficult to achieve, but possible.  Just like those Acme pianos falling on us.  We can change the PoW algo as a defense.
Critical bugs.  All developing software and tech has bugs.  We have very skilled developers trying to mitigate this, and a fantastic peer review process.  Again, we could fork to fix bugs if need be.
Satoshi moving coins.  This will always remain a possibility if Satoshi remains anonymous.   This is no different than the founder or CEO of a company publicly stating they are selling their stake.
Bitcoin has similar odds to any tech based company of "crashing".  You used that word several times.  Apple could have a flaw in its OS that could be exploited and cause all its devices to be bricked.   And Acme pianos could fall on all of us.
I'm in no way trying to say your points aren't valid, they are just rather old talking points that are much less relevant now that Bitcoin has multiplied user adoption, hash rate securing the network,  and has "survived" the attacks it's faced thus far.
I would actually argue that Apple stock, or any tech investment, carries almost the identical investment risk as Bitcoin. 
However,  users still need to continue to educate themselves on personal operational security for their coins.

Like most businesses that need to maintain liquid capital they will most likely build-out in stages.  It would not make any sense for them to wait until everything is complete to fire up miners.  It will be done so in stages,  based upon many factors that make sense for them as a business.
It would be cheaper for them to pay off devs and media outlets if they had malicious intent.  Not spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a massive mining facility.   
Put the meth pipes down and take off the tin foil hats.  This is good for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:16:37
I understand that point.  However, the free market decides who, and how many people can use Bitcoin.  It also decides how much that person will need to pay for a remittance service, a peer to peer cash system, or a store of value. 
The market has been setting the transaction values and capacity all along.  The market alone determines what software we use for wallets, mining, and nodes. 
Bitcoin is a decentralized free market.  If that statement is false I would love to hear how?  If it is true, then it's a fact that we have all contributed, for good or bad, to the current capacity and transaction fees associated with the use of Bitcoin.

This is ridiculous.   There are a lot of brilliant people in the Bitcoin space,  but a lack of business sense is being displayed here. 
Bitmain, like most businesses, always have a very high need for liquid capital.  An expansive build-out by most companies is done in phases to ensure the business does not over extend themselves.  The miners will come on in phases.  Bitmain would lose millions of dollars waiting for everything to be completed, and then cutting on all the rigs at once. 
If Bitmain had malicious intent it would be much easier and cheaper to bribe devs and media outlets,  and/or DDoS all major exchanges and short the crap out of BTC.  Not spending hundreds of millions of dollars building a massive mining facility.
The buildings and facilities may be done in December, but the rigs will not be.  With the current price of btc climbing, and cold weather setting in, it should be expected for the hash rate to continue climbing prior and during Bitmain's new rigs coming online.  
I fail to see how an experienced company in the Bitcoin space expanding its operations,  adding more nodes and hash rate to further secure the ledger, can be seen as malicious in any way.

That could also just be Bitcoin reminding us its a decentralized free market.  Businesses, miners, and investors deserve to earn a reward for helping to secure the greatest invention in tech, and perhaps mankind, since the internet.  
Users should pay a fee to be able to transact with their peers quickly and securely.  Users should pay a fee for being able to store and transfer an asset of any value.  
For anyone complaining about a 20 cent fee for securing, processing a transaction, or storing said transaction on an immutable ledger, you obviously have a lot to worry about in life.  Hopefully Bitcoin can help preserve what little wealth you may have, and create a brighter future for your family.

Often times commodities tend to trade near their actual cost to produce.  If the difficulty to mine a block were to at worst stay the same from now until the reward halving in 2020, the actual cost to produce Bitcoins will instantly double at the next halving.  
However, Bitcoin has a fairly proven track record with increasing difficulty.   If said difficulty continues to increase to the average cost of mining one Bitcoin is around 12,000 USD in May of 2020, then in the following month when the block reward is halved, the actual cost to produce one Bitcoin is now 24,000.
It is possible that some miners will turn off their miners, and the difficulty may adjust down some, making it slightly less than 24,000 production cost.

There is a difference between gambling and investing.  They are not the same at all.
When you gamble the house has an edge.  In the long run, it always wins.  That is gambling. 
With investing there is no mathematical formula to determine your possible loss long term.  Loss isn't baked in, like casino games. 
You could make an argument that day trading is gambling, but a near to long term investment is not gambling.  its INVESTING.
That make any sense?

Bitcoins technology kicked off in 1998 with a paper published by Wei Dai, called B Money. Shortly after Nick Szabo released his paper on a digital currency using proof of work. 
The late Hal Finney added to these revolutionary ideas with his insight into a reusable proof of work system, and Adam Bach published a paper pre Satoshi as well.
Satoshi bound these revolutionary ideas together to help bring Bitcoin to the world in 2009.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:09:33
You are thinking short term my friend.  Right now it will be hoarded as a store of value.  Once everyone wants to use it as a globalised standard unit of currency, and it has reached an astronomical value compared to traditional currencies, people will start spending on what they like.  If traditional currencies die out, you will be paid in BTC.  It would make global business frictionless and more efficient with only one unit of accounting to value all goods. 
It starts with the people hoarding it.  Attracting users and helping give it a value in terms of something people can understand, fiat currencies. 100 years from now, it may be so entrenched in everyday life, it is then used as a currency with inflation.  
Meaning in 2140 i can buy a house for 0.10  BTC.  However, due to the real  estate market appreciating over the next 2 years, in 2142 that same house  now costs 0.11 BTC.  How can peole hoard it if thats the only way to buy a house in 100 years?
This is Bitcoin being used as a currency, and having inflation.  It is no longer a deflationary currency, as it isn't traded or bartered for any other currency, there aren't more being created, and it's used for everything involving the need for a currency payment.  Rent, food, and taxes.  
I don't claim any of this to be fact, just merely my perspective how Bitcoin could be used as currency with inflation many years from now.

The fact people feel the need to rely on a social media site (Twitter), or a privately owned payment processor (Square), is the problem.
Capitalism works because private businesses have the option to take stances based on their owners beliefs.  We then get to choose which company to give our business to, based on our own personal beliefs. 
Luckily, you have the right to choose where you post your memes, and who processes your CC payments as a small business owner. 
Arguing a privately owned business, which has the rights to operate how they prefer legally, is responsible for providing basic human rights to people like food, water, or free speech, seems like a stretch. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:11:21
False.  It's currently being developed, and evolving.  It will be a decentralized peer to peer electronic cash, it's just going to take decades.  
First it will be a store of value, and will continue to do so until the bad money is forced out.  Fiat = Bad money.  
Once all the bad money is rendered useless, Bitcoin will be used as a global currency. There will be no going back to fiat.
The world needs a standard unit of account for business, and to meet the increasing demands being forced by globalization.

Actually it is.  There will probably never be a perfect solution for online payments, but CC's are so 1980's.
The obvious downside for businesses is credit card chargebacks.  With Bitcoin, you know your getting paid.  
To help combat chargebacks.  Many businesses require a lot of personal info when you pay online.  They do this in the hopes people will be less likely to commit chargeback fraud if they are at least not anonymous in doing so.
The downside to that, is now all your personal info are on some websites server waiting to be hacked.  Obviously Bitcoin solves this problem.
If your slight against Bitcoin as a payment service is that people  will lose their coins, then people need to evolve and learn better payment methods and habits.  They will.
Also, I'm fairly confident Bitcoin will evolve over the next few years making harder to send your coins to a wrong address.  That's definitely just speculation though.
u/gonzobon Can you explain to me how my private keys are ever at risk shopping on Overstock and paying with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:04:03
You can start with any amount.   I have setup two wallets for my daughters, my youngest is 8.  I purchase a small amount for them monthly.
You can purchase as little as 10 bucks a month from Coinbase, or other exchanges.  It is important that once you have several hundred dollars of Bitcoin, you will want to transfer the coins to a wallet you control.  No need to trust third parties with your coin. 
This will all make more sense to you as you venture down the rabbit hole towards financial sovereignty.

You are incorrect.  There is a reason investing and gambling have different meanings.  
Just because two things share a couple similar attributes, does not make them the same.
Gambling is a massive industry, and you just cherry picked one sector to support your beliefs.  Also it is not a fact that there is a house edge in sports betting.  It's your claim that you can gain a house edge. 
In general, the house always has an edge in sports betting.  It's located in the commission, and or spread.

Because of the new security features in credit cards, the majority of the fraud is now done via CNP, card not present.  Hackers are gaining a lot of these CC numbers through phishing, and hacking e-commerce sites and POS systems.
In the near future I think Bitcoin will help eradicate a large portion of this.  If websites move to only accepting crypto currencies, there are no CC numbers to steal.  Same goes for POS systems.

Why are you wasting time defending this guy's judgement.  His points have all been proven inaccurate.  He is either mistaken, disillusioned, or blatantly lying.
Yes he was lucky to invest a large amount of money into Bitcoin early.  That was a gamble, and it paid off for him.  Then he was smart to diversify and invest in other Bitcoin related projects.  But that is where his intelligence ends.
He is not an economist.  He is not a successful business owner.  He is not a software developer.  He has never been a part or played any role in project managing an open source protocol.
He is a used car salesman who made a very good/lucky investment. Does he use Bitcoin?  Yes.  Does he understand how it works.  No.    
So again, why are you defending his judgements and opinions in matters he doesn't know anything about on a technical level, or play any role in developing?

That is the underlying factor to the progression I mentioned.  As you often write about, security and decentralized protocol development are crucial for Bitcoin to advance and succeed in the ways many of us hope for.
I can only speak for myself, but I am very grateful that you are not alone in your work ethic and integrity in regards to developing and testing Bitcoin.   There are a few developers who the community owes a lot to.   Some of you work very very hard for Bitcoin.  
You are helping to make the world a better place G Max.  Thank you!!!

Right.  It's been the same nonsense over and over from this clown troll.   
Crying over bullshit.  Bitcoin is doing great, despite the efforts of some bad actors, and the amount of ignorance from the "community".
PSA For Trolls: 
If you haven't been working on, developing, or testing Bitcoin's protocol for a few years.  If you haven't been studying and following cryptography, or engineering massive open source projects for a few years.  If you think reading Popular Mechanics makes you a mechanic and engineer, and thus should have a say in designing cars...
Please shut the fuck up.  Your opinion about the security, design, and ACTUAL abilities of some software means dick.  Same as mine. 
Just because any user, community or economic majority wants the software to perform their favorite wizardry, doesn't mean it can. 
Back under your bridge trolls.

I'm not sure you understand Liquor Cost as it it appears on P and L reports for restaurants and bars.  
Liquor Cost, which is alcohol only and not including beer or wine, is almost always around 10 percent for any normal functioning bar or restaurant.   
Wine Cost is generally between 15 and 20 percent, due to lower margins, and waste on wines poured by the glass.
Beer Cost is generally around 12 to 17 percent.  
Please note these costs do not ever contain labor, rent, etc.  These are how these costs appear on a Profit and Loss report for a business.  Labor and rent are reported elsewhere. 
So if your friend buys a bottle of cheap booze for his bar for 10 bucks, he should expect to generate 100 dollars in sales. That is a 10 percent liquor cost.  If he is only generating a 40 to 50 percent profit as you mentioned, his employees are either stealing, or getting hammered, or both.

It is private companies who issue the debit cards, they are not registered banks.  They ensure the business receives fiat if that's what the business wants.   It would be better if fiat was not involved, but this is a start. 
There are many businesses accepting Bitcoin directly.  Farmer's market booths, convenience stores, utility companies, e-commerce stores, and many many more.  Bitcoin is also being used in B2B payments.   It is cheaper than sending wire transfers, and much faster.
I agree it is not perfect as a currency now, and may never be, but it is evolving.   It takes a lot time to build a decentralized currency.

That does not make Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme in any way.   Ponzi schemes offer a guaranteed profit or return,  Bitcoin does not.  Also Bitcoin is decentralized,  where traditional Ponzi schemes always have a,"man behind the curtain" controlling the scheme.

Welcome!  Congrats on doing your own research in regards to Bitcoin prior to investing.  
Sounds like you are on the right track by purchasing a hardware wallet to store your funds offline, and to protect yourself from an infected computer or malware. 
One piece of advice in regards to Coinbase.  If you are going to use BTC to cash out winnings or make deposits, do it directly from your Trezor.  Coinbase will quickly ban you if they know you are gambling. 
Good luck with your poker!
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:17:00
Simple.   All Ponzi schemes promise a return or profit.   Bitcoin does not. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:27:25
I don't try to give any advice other than buy BTC, and store it in cold storage.  
However, you can look at what happened to the last fork of Bitcoin, BCH, and see what happened to its price.  
There are already a thousand different alts out there,  so I'm not completely sure what the hell these developers and miners are trying to accomplish by hard forking off the main chain. 
Just my thoughts though.

I'm glad you are so fortunate to be able to know the future.  You sure sound like a realist... When you attempt to predict the future.  Fortune tellers obviously have a firm grasp on reality
You obviously don't know very much about Bitcoin, or the decentralized network it's protocol flourishes on.  You gave that away when you said, "when it crashes".  Or, "when the US government bans it".  More uneducated talking points please. 
So congrats on being a realist fortune teller.  You should start another sub reddit.

Any flaw in Bitcoin could be fixed by rolling back the Blockchain, and a hard fork.  Would the value in shit dollars plummet?  Yes.  Go to zero?  No.

1.  You can spend bitcoins everywhere you said you could not.  Do your research.  There are bitcoin debit cards, sites that allow you to purchase Amazon gift cards, and other P2P options. Overstock has hoarded their BTC from customer's purchases, not traded it for fiat.
2.  Citizens of countries with high inflation are currently and have been using BTC as a currency.  It is a decentralized Peer to Peer network, so it can circumvent the foolish state actors who attempt to ban it.  However, as of right now, most countries have not made it illegal in any way. 
3. The value is going up because of supply and demand. However, there are many more use cases that you just don't seem to recognize, whereas many other investors continue to invest because they/we do. I know it sounds crazy, but some of us don't even care what the price is.  
Again, I would encourage you to do more research, perhaps you will understand the many use cases for Bitcoin now, and hopefully in the future.  Let me know when carrying around an ounce of gold is the equivalent of having a Swiss bank in your pocket, it may have some real value then.

I have noticed a much different trend that what you are seeing.  My friends and family that invested within the past year, are all doing DCA with the intentions of hodling for ten years. 
Bitcoin is also less volatile now, which could be an indicator of more people buying small amounts regularly with zero intentions of selling short term.  Look at the success of hardware wallets.  
Bitcoin has been redistributed to the masses over the past 6 years.  Here is an example.  Bob buys 1000 Bitcoins @ 5 per BTC.  He decides to sell out, literally and figuratively at 5000 per BTC.  Because Bitcoin is now worth 5000 per coin, if Alice and her friends were to invest the same amount of capital as Bob, they would each own one coin.  Now instead of one holder who is ready to sell out,  we gained 1,000 new hodlers.  And since most people on earth can't even afford one now, the redistribution is actually much greater. 
In this basic example,  you can clearly see how Bitcoins are being redistributed.   Bob made a great profit,  and I assume a lot of the people buying now,  don't want to sell at 10k, or even 20k, but perhaps want to see what it is in ten years.

I could understand the need for a business to be neutral in certain instances, this is not one of them.
Dear Coinbase,  the only reason you have a billion dollar business today is because the the tireless work 1000's of developers have put in to test, and develop Bitcoin's protocol.
Because of that work, users have invested both fiat and trust into this system. Because of that trust, you now have a billion dollar business.  
Now instead of taking a stance to support your users, you are playing the fence and creating distrust in a system we have spent years building.  
Do you really think it is fair to the users to not take a stance?  Do you really want to advocate in anyway an alt coin that had one lead dev who quit to make a shit coin?   This makes no sense.  
Thankfully, Bitcoin is designed to be anti fragile,  and will March on.  But fuck you for caring more about a handful of businesses than the users and developers who got you here.

Good for you for trying to help your friends and family.  Many of us share your strong convictions on the potential of Bitcoin.   Venezuela utilizing Bitcoin is what we envisioned many years ago.   Providing financial inclusion to the poor, and eliminating the governments ability to devalue it's citizen's fiat savings,  is why I personally invest in Bitcoin.  
I don't care about the price.  I don't care if I make money or lose money.  I want to feel like I helped make the world a better place.  Bitcoin gives me that opportunity.

Congratulations on looking to become a young investor.  It amazes me how many younger people are investing so much earlier than previous generations.  
The most important part of investing in Bitcoin is owning your private keys.  No keys, no coins.   Invest in a hardware wallet, and find solace in knowing your coins are protected for your future.  Do not ever trust an exchange, a hot wallet, or any other third party with your precious Bitcoin.  Cold storage for the win. 
Congrats to you man.

Another alternative is to sign up for Bread wallet, and then you can purchase with ACH through Wyre.  Takes a couple days to register with them.  And there is a 2500 dollar a week limit. 
Wyre charges a 20 dollar fee for the 2500 dollar ACH.  And then Bread has a slight markup on the coin you purchased, but I don't think it's very high.  Definitely much cheaper than ATM fees. 
Some people get black balled from the big exchanges here in the US, for various reasons,  and this route may be useful for them.

There is no solution that I'm aware of, yet.  There will be one soon.  Square has now entered the Bitcoin space, allowing users to buy and sell BTC through their app. 
Square is also one of the largest POS providers for small businesses in the world.  It only makes sense that they will start by allowing their merchants to seamlessly accept Bitcoin through their POS.  Eventually, we may see a service like you are wanting. 
I highly recommend Square.  I use them for my business POS, and small BTC buys.

Bitcoin has inflation until all the coins are mined, so another 100 years.  It is not deflationary. 
It can be used as a hedge against other currencies with a higher rate inflation.
Bitcoin isn't going to eradicate any of the top 5 fiat currencies within the next 20 years.  They can and will coexist.
Your main point was Bitcoin can't be used for loans or mortgages.  In the future if people are being paid in BTC for working, then it absolutely could.
I borrow 1 BTC from a lender to buy a house.  I pay back 1.25 BTC over time,  the same as a current loan works.  For BTC to ever reach the point of displacing a top 5 national currency, it will reach a point that it is no longer as volatile as it is now.  
I personally think that is 30-50 years.  For most of our lives, Bitcoin and fiat currencies should coexist.  Revolution and evolution doesn't happen overnight.  
Just my thoughts though, and I'm great at being wrong, so who knows.

You can sell BTC for PayPal funds easily with localbitcoins.com
To prevent scammers, only sell small amounts at a time,  around 50 USD, only sell to verified PayPal accounts, and most importantly,  have them mark that they are sending the funds to friends or family.  This will help you avoid chargebacks, and not have to pay PayPal seller fee's. 
For the record &lt;-- no username pun intended,  I hate PayPal, and I'm sure scammers still know a way to screw you.  Where there's a will, there's a scammer.

I respect Erik greatly for a couple reasons.  As a successful business owner, and as an early adopter.   
The downside for Erik seems to be his lack of judgement in other people's character.   He chose to allow a criminal to invest in Shapeshift, he didn't have to.
I do not think because someone breaks the law, they should be deemed a criminal.  However, when they knowingly put other people's lives in jeopardy to make a profit,  they are a criminal. 
I'm very curious as to why Erik let a criminal invest in his business.  I'm also curious why he doesn't buy him out.

That's a good point, thank you.  
Only way real estate can plummet to zero is similar to gold.  Everyone needs to wake up tomorrow morning and decide it is worthless.  
It is possible, but highly unlikely.  I do consider many investments less risky than Bitcoin, but they are just as likely as Bitcoin to plummet to zero.  It would take a doomsday event, or the entire world waking up and deciding they are worthless. 
Another unlikely scenario that could damage real estate is if it is discovered that the leading manufacturer of drywall has cancer causing properties in its products, and 99 percent of the homes and commercial buildings are affected.

@_date: 2017-05-05 12:28:03
But the odds of Bitcoin crashing to zero. How likely do you think that is?  
Do you also tell friends that gold or Apple stock could lose half it's market cap at any time, and is risky?  
Do you warn friends that they are losing money daily by having fiat in a bank account, and fiat is thus a very risky investment?  Inflation is destroying their purchasing power. 
If the US found itself in a domestic and foreign war, the USD would plummet abruptly.  Your buying power would be cut in half at least.  
All of these instances lack probability,  but are certainly possible.  And yet I've only heard Bitcoin is the risky investment compared to Apple stock or gold.

Ok.  So outside of a doomsday scenario, please explain to me how Bitcoin could plummet to zero overnight, or over the course of a few days.
Apple products could have had a kill switch installed in it at the factory by a bad actor, causing the devices to be bricked if activated. 
I would argue that investing in any product that runs on software is as risky as investing I'm Bitcoin.  They could all be hacked. 
Can you show me how this thinking is flawed?  How is investing in Apple stock less risky than investing in Bitcoin? 
And people could wake up tomorrow and decide gold is worthless, so it is risky.  Perhaps a study is released showing gold increases your odds of getting cancer by touching it, or wearing jewelry made from it.  It would plummet in value. 
I would like to hear your thoughts.   Thanks!

After you do some research, and find out why he went to jail,  maybe you can answer the question that Erik can not.
How does endangering innocent lives for profit not make you a criminal?
And to put a little perspective on the topic of crime and criminals,  I was facing a life sentence at age 19 for trafficking cocaine.  I spent 3 years in prison.  So I can certainly relate to people suffering at the hands of bs laws, but this doesn't apply here.
People change, and I'm not saying he is a criminal now, but he certainly was when he ENDANGERED innocent lives for profit.
The fact Erik can defend this astounds me.

Well, you are doing a fine job of losing respect from this community Erik, who also happen to be your customers.  And I didn't mention scaling or his name. 
His crimes were placing innocent lives at risk for profit.  He knowingly shipped small explosive devices through the USPS.  These items were shipped on planes.  
Suppose he shipped 100 orders out one day.  They are all on a plane together.   One device detonates, causing the others to detonate.  Suppose another criminal was shipping bootleg alcohol, and the explosive devices your buddy sent going off, caused a an explosion and fire on the plane. 
The plane crashes into a school and kills 1000 people.   
What he did was absolutely criminal, and could have killed innocent people.   You should be ashamed for trying to minimize shipping fucking explosives through standard mail.  
You are saying it's ok he put people's lives at risks because nobody died?  How is that an argument?
Build me a bridge Erik.  How is endangering innocent lives for profit not criminal?

Thank you again for taking the time to answer.  I have one more question for you. 
In what way are you able to determine any fundamentals for an investment (Bitcoin), when no other investment like it currently exists, or has before?
Seems like any traditional instruments for estimating risk using your formula, or similar risk to reward ratios used on traditional markets, like the stock market, are not applicable when gauging risk with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:24:51

Everything ETH can do, Bitcoin will be able to do via sidechains and L2.  However, there is definitely plenty of room for both.
The crypto currency market cap has grown exponentially the past year, and I do think some of the newer alts are definitely helping with that.  Just look at the amount of money on marketing that is being spent on alt coin launches now.
I think many of us who are not cypherpunks forget the value of decentralization.   Many alt coins suffer from a lack of being decentralized.   For me, this is Bitcoin's greatest value proposition.  
There are many investments I could make with my time and money, but none are as rewarding as helping the financially under served gain some hope. Hopefully the state controlled fiat chains of oppression will one day be broken.
Long live crypto!

An investment losing half it's market cap is very common.  
An investment with a multi-billion dollar market cap losing half it's market cap abruptly is fairly rare.  BP oil spill 10 years ago comes to mind. 
An investment with a large market cap going to zero abruptly is very rare.  I cannot think of one instance where that has happened. 
The reason for the post is that I now longer think it is accurate at all to tell new investors it could go to zero.  So could Apple stock, but I don't hear the same kind of warnings that I do with Bitcoin. 
When you mention Bitcoin being only worth a dollar, it was certainly much easier for it to crash to zero, than presently. Smaller market cap, few developers, not as decentralized, new protocol, etc.

It's the ultimate play here.  Use quantitative easing to flood your domestic market with your state controlled fiat, while also buying Bitcoin as an investment. 
As the value of your state controlled fiat decrease both domestically and internationally,
your investments in other stores of value increase.

Buying Bitcoin to hold is an investment.  It is in no way akin to betting at a casino.  That is called gambling.  
You could make an argument that day trading is gambling.  
Its also quite easy to value Bitcoin.  And there are several ways  to currently do so.  If you are investing for nothing more than to support a decentralized currency, then your value is derived by Bitcoin's success up to this point.
If you are using Bitcoin as a store of value against traditional fiat currencies, then simply pull up an exchange and see your "value".
