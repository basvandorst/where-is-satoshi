You could sit and wait for the atoms in your desk to randomly fuse into gold. About the same probability (not really but funny to think about as a way of communicating just how unlikely it would be to guess a private key).

Ethereum is working on at least some of those, especially the decentralized reputation. It's a pretty ambitious project, but they have some pretty smart people.

Is that a BitAccess unit?

Okay, I've found my wallet.dat file, and saved a copy. Is that all I need in terms of having access to my wallet? As for which client I use, I'm pretty indifferent as long as it works, so it looks like bitcoin-qt probably isn't the best choice but I'll take a look at your suggestions.
Thank you!

I've copied it to another folder and I also backup my machine to external hard drive every day, is that enough to keep it backed up? If so, will I be able to manually import it into the fresh install of Bitcoin-Qt?

Hmm, I can't seem to find a wallet.dat folder. Any idea where it would be on a Mac? Bitcoin-Qt is is in the normal applications folder.

Thanks for answering!
1) I'm not sure, it's the version I downloaded about one month ago. When I look to see which version it is, it just gives dashes.
2) I'm running the only account on the machine, which has admin privileges.
3) It get's to the "loading wallet" stage, and then crashes, bringing up the standard OS X "do you want to report or ignore, etc" dialog box. I've looked at the report it generates but can't make heads or tails of it.

Ok great, thanks. Will this copy over my wallet automatically? Also, any idea why it took so long to stop working? I was using it without a problem yesterday.

Oh also, what exactly will dragging my wallet.dat onto that blockchain.info site do? Thanks again for the help!
