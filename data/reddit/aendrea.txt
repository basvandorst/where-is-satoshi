Does anyone here know these guys? This is an idea I just started thinking about from a week ago, and I'd really like to go work with them. I'd move without hesitation.

"The Association said that Bitcoin did not pose a threat to traditional financial institutions—like many regulators and most people in the Bitcoin community believe. Instead, the ATMIM said that it believes Bitcoin is an “important global currency” that can work with standing institutions, rather than against them."
What do we think about this statement?

I had been following bitcoin closely, but I haven't fully adopted for this reason, even though I would like to. Bitcoin community discourages thinking of btc as an investment like gold, instead it encourages using it like a currency, on a daily basis. But when I think about my daily currency, I don't think "I'll not have more than I can lose." Of course, I don't carry all my money in my physical wallet, and that parallel describes the relationship between offline and online btc wallets. But how can bitcoin convince adoption by the public when just a normal person like me, who wants to be able to use it without thinking "I could lose everything?" What can bitcoin provide as consumer protection or insurance like the FDIC? What's on the road to come that will make someone like me switch over? I'd just like to know.
