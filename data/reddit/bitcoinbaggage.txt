It is on the reddit rules. Like the entire site rules. The rules that supersede all sidebar rules.

Congrats to the teams at both companies.
@_date: 2014-08-09 03:06:48
Beatin' ass!
Also, nice scoop!
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:19:12
I think we have been down this road once already: 
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:43:42
And now according to this report he is accepting them soon :)
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:10:25
Fucking dicks. Screenshot sent to Foundation. Even if you dislike the guy what you are doing is pretty shitty. Is this how the foundation wants to be represented? By fucking assholes demeaning someone likely in a ditch somewhere?
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:11:40
Go listen to him right now on that radio station. He says what many consider to be a great deal of inflammatory shit.

This isn't an option for everyone, everywhere though. For example where i live :( So this is celebrated for me.

Given the fact that Tom has literally been vanished from existence, and while it could be a giant trick by him this was kind of distasteful to poke fun.
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:00:15
You do realize reddit has a rule against using "breaking news" in the title of your link right?
Why not dump your press release to some sites and not on reddit?
Just curious. Your site also looks horrible.
Not trying to be a dick but seriously the site is awful and doesn't send the right message. The event looks like it has a shitload of awesome people at it but the site says we don't know shit about development.
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:49:26
Dick move bro. Making an accusation against one of the only four sites I trusted. Looks like I can remove your site from that list making it three.
@_date: 2014-08-09 03:07:22
If only my local subway would do this! I should talk to them about it.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:13:34
CryptocoinsNews.com is pumping it. NewsBTC.com is pumping it. Basically all of the news sites are pumping it like a motherfucker and even some traditional media sites.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:58:32
Did you know the CCN author was suing several other bloggers?
Of course they fired him. They *had* to fire him. He is a bomber, he is suing journalists. Great sort of journalist to have on board eh?
Why aren't CCN going after Scott Fargo and others who accepted money from GAW for pumping the scam?
The only reason they are doing this now is because of the damaged reputation and the fact that this one might blow up as people investigating learn the truth about this particular author.
They claim the majority of traffic isn't from reddit yet they are here trying to control the damage.
Where is "David" now that the questions have increased?
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:19:15
Please don't submit them here: 
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:21:26
I stumbled a bit then went back and read it again as well. No harm, no foul.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:20:42
I think looking back at the past the scam claims have been going for a long time. Don't defend a group that is OBVIOUSLY shilling for them. Not just wrapped in advertisements but pushing PR pieces, scrubbing and changing things.
Go read the article. They aren't just pushing an advertisement, they are intimately connected.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:22:53
This is more than just an advertisement.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:46:37
This is just damage control. The same tactics and smears will keep happening.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:39:04
Look at the other sites they sell advertisements on. This ad network is one of the biggest pumpers of paycoin after craptocoinsnews.
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:29:04
They locked it, removed all posts but the official post from them and it is now at a new link.
Any one mentioning this on other threads suddenly finds posts deleted as well.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:54:26
Please do not share links for sites that are engaged in promoting the paycoins scam.
The community needs to police itself and one way to do that is no longer allowing scam promoters the ability to promote scams here.
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:06:49
Love how they are trying to downplay this over on the GAWsome side of things.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:22:12
Obviously or else you guys would stop pushing obvious scams.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:09:03
They seem the best to do this. Extremely professional, cite sources. They are honest.
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:05:49
How is this *not* getting more attention?
People vote for CCN stories still? (Looks at homepage)
Whoa. Two stories, one for CCN, one for Hacked.com both owned by same clowns.
CCN is complete scum. Linkbait, paycoin pumping scum.
Shame on people who upvote them. I hope we all enjoy it when CCN writers get what they want... Coin Fire shut down, GAW pumped more and reddit filled with more spam from them.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:49:16
Shifty in that it uses shifty coins like PAYCOIN.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:42:57
Stop promoting scams like GAW Miners.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:41:27
I shudder from the truth in this statement.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:01:59
That's seriously legitimately fucked up.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:48:24
They are helping spread the scam. KNOWN SCAM. For many months known scam.
Dude, seriously, WTF.
The community is right on this one. Those that are helping to keep this scam going need to be stopped. Josh keeps advertising, keeps buying news sites, keeps buying advertisements and sponsoring shit to keep this going.
These people are enabling this to keep going. We seriously need to stop it. Moe needs to hear us and know we won't stand for it. People are fucking sick and tired of this shit destroying cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:22:31
What will it take to remedy this at least on @_date: 2015-01-02 16:45:51
Paging @_date: 2015-01-02 16:50:05
No, it says, hey let's give a break to the people that ENABLE this scam to spread.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:04:05
Whoever the first comment on here is clearly shadowbanned.
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:26:50
They do realize that the Coin Fire post was made minutes before they said anything on Hashtalk. Right?
Or wait.. wait.. Coin Fire made that all up within two minutes, traveled back in time to get the screenshots and what not.
Are those people really that delusional?
Edit: Clicked on that link and the thread was locked and all posts removed but the paybase official one. Censorship FTW.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:38:19
Knock it off with links to sites pumping paycoin already. We don't want that in our community. Details: 
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:41:46
Seriously? Bad move Bruce.
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:06:19
But but but I thought Josh Garza is the "industry leader". Surely the up and coming industry leader for credit card payments would know who he is and what his projects are..... right?
@_date: 2015-01-07 07:37:18
Oh shit son. David Parker is here now. Watch the downvotes on this start flying in.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:56:04
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:49:27
Certain domains being linked results in almost immediate downvoting. Literally within 3 or 4 minutes.
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:23:49
Damn Coin Fire being a "thorn".
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:40:22
Doubtful. Even after being revealed as frauds by a guy in the past on here (who had his life threatened later) they kept pulling the same crap.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:43:41
Just made my reading list for that. F-ing awesome.
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:03:24
People said the same thing when they reported the 1-800-Flowers acceptance two weeks before they made a public announcement. They research.
