Like I said: evidence was presented at trial.  The defense did not argue the evidence.  They opted for a strategy that relies on appeals which was a very risky move.  The evidence from Force and the instance of murder-for-hire stemming from Force was purposely omitted from the trial.  Instead 5 other murder-for-hire instances were brought forth.

That must have been one hell of an awakening.

That can't be right, if this sub-reddit is correct, then the price of BTC is determined by the block size.

Truly horrifying that the system bitcoin was designed to exploit will be the system that sustains it.  Bitcoins entire success from inception has hinged on the system of greed.

What accomplishments led to Balaji being on that stage?  What did he do before anyone heard about 21.

Because they didn't need to charge him, it would have complicated the case and there was no reason to do that.  As you can see, they had enough to put him away for life without it.

I do that too, even though I know 1 bit is 100 satoshis I still double check.

I prefer .00001234.  I know exactly how much bitcoin that is.  I think I only prefer this because there was only satoshi for denominations when I learned.  I'm slowly adapting to bits but I do not prefer it and I change the denomination from bits to btc whenever I get the chance with an app.  I avoid apps like breadwallet because they do not give me a choice.

I think you are right.  I think we will move beyond the necessity for fees long before block rewards become insignificant and private interests will ensure the network for the sake of protecting their business and not because they want
eed the fees.  We can already see companies like 21 cropping up that want to assume some portion of network processing.  We have exchanges like Coinbase who have a vested interest in a secure network.  Venture Capitalists investing money in wallet providers are not going to ignore the security of the network and undermine their investments through inaction.

Blocksize has nothing to do with block rewards.  Blocksize affects storage not hashing power and storage is cheap.

I just don't buy the idea that the venture capitalists weren't already awakened in the beginning of 2013.   Balaji must have come with something else, something more.  I'm struggling with the syllables to explain this..

This right here is where I find a lot of faith in the future of the network.  We are just now seeing companies like 21 offering to step up and make mining more mainstream.  We have wallet providers like coinbase who are becoming very big and have a vested interest in a secure network.  We have things like the COIN ETF that will bring in many new players and deep pockets and all of them will become soldiers for the network in some way.  And these examples are only in the USA, bitcoin is international and you can expect this to be replicated everywhere it takes hold.  Bitcoins future has never looked brighter.

Evidence for murder-for-hire was presented at the trial.

Bitcoin doesn't need to increase in value for this to happen.  You can already break it down to pennies and a big social platform is going to do most user to user transactions off-chain anyhow.

We don't need to create a miner welfare system to help miners.  Miners could help themselves right now by not dumping millions of dollars worth of bitcoin on the market every day.  Miners can do this now, or they can sit back and wait for the code to force it to happen.  It will happen, so there is no need to make it happen artificially and undermine the rules that everyone up to this point have agreed to.
