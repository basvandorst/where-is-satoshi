Translation: When running lncli describegraph, 32.31% of nodes does not provide an IP address, so I can't look up where they are from.

I am tracking the entire network graph, sampled at five minutes intervals since a week ago. How do you mean one should differentiate between channel failure and channel closure?
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:39:07


Can confirm, it's the same node: SLEEPYARK, owned by Blockstream.
I have to add though that "capacity" means the total capacity of all the channels with the node, regardless if the funds currently are allocted to the local or remote node.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:15:24


Because you send bitcoins in the bitcoin lightning network?


Sort of, the total capacity is the the sum of all the bitcoins in all the payment channels. You can also see the distribution of these bitcoins among the channels and nodes in the histograms.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:57:37


It just varied down. I'm not playing with the numbers, only presenting what the gossip network gives me. ;)
 


It's indeed calculated with the BTC:USD rate sampled at the same time as the sample from the lightning network, every five minutes.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:55:56
Hmm, might be worth looking in to. So far I've been logging the complete network graph along with some other info such as bitcoin block height and bitcoin price at sampling time, so all data that is derived from that I can reconstruct back in time, but if I add something completely new I won't be able to calculate it backwards.
I think I'm going to focus on getting all the stuff I already have in mind ready (We're not even halfway there), but if you end up experimenting with parsing bug logs and get something useful out of it, please PM me.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:28:29
Indeed it is. I started working on this a week ago when there were six nodes on the mainnet. Started panicing and really working on the data collecting when it reached about 20. Managed to get the data collecting done before we hit 50 nodes at least.
Will continue adding more charts and graphs as we go.

Don't worry, sorry if I sounded a tad bit too defensive.
I do get why you asked the question, since it looked like it only went up. :)
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:41:28
Thanks. Lots of things will be added in the coming days. I will take your feedback in regard.
P.S. Total capacity does vary over time, as can be seen from the historic total capacity vs time chart, bottom left.

At first I thought this was some deluxe machine translation gore, but after reading the original text in Swedish I must concede that it is about as bizarre in the original language...
Most likely due to the journalist verbatim quoting stream of taught from a person that clearly doesn't know enough and hasn't really taught everything through...
The biggest translation error was that he called blockchain technology "super important", not "supervised". Apart from that, the text is about as nonsensical in swedish as in the english machine translation.

Your upside will always be limited and your downside will always be unlimited if you short any raw asset.
As for the easiest way, register at [BitMex]( transfer funds and open a short position. Make sure to let us know when you get margincalled and end up on [BitMexRekt](

I try to keep ~$100 equivalent in a hot wallet on my cellphone for when I get opportunities to pay with bitcoin in my day to day life. If it appreciates above $200 I transfer the gains back to cold storage so that I have $100 equivalent and if it drops below $50 equivalent I transfer what's needed to reach $100 from cold storage the next time I'm at home.
My basic advice is, don't have more bitcoin in a hot wallet than you would have had ordinary cash in an ordinary wallet.

And regarding if a HW wallet is worth it for storing 10 bitcoins; even if you count high with $100, that's still less then a tenth of a percent. It's basically nothing.

Well, technically not rounded but truncated, and then the last satoshi is lottoed away with the probability of each node winning it being proportional to how much of it they originally owned in the LN.
Assume we hava 100 satoshi LN channel between Alice an Bob. Upon closing the channel, the balance for Alice is 71.37 satoshis, and the balance for Bob is 28.63 satoshis.
Alice gets 71 satoshis straight away, and Bob gets 28 satoshis straight away. Then they enter a draw about the last satoshi, where alice has a 37% chance of winning it, and Bob has a 63% chance of winning it.

$2? Yesterday I payed $0.1 equivalent to do a single input SegWit transaction that got mined in the next block...
The problem isn't block size, the problem is wallets and exchanges overestimating needed fees and users blindly trusting and using the suggested fees.

Well, I assume the state you live in hasn't banned bitcoin either? 
But my point was if I needed to quickly flee my country of residence due to it turning bad, I would move my assets using bitcoin. On arrival in the new country I would of course diversify again.


Yes. The strategy of leaving a country turning increasingly bad worked out great for jews in 1930's Germany, for my mother in 1960's eastern europe and a lot of other people throughout history.
I speculate that a state banning bitcoin is an early and very clear sign that it does not respect the financial autonomy of it's population, and I would get out of there before they implement even worse laws.

I am very serious. My mother fled a communist country in 1969 and I have her decision to thank for growing up in relative prosperity. If the country I live in goes completely sideways (and banning bitcoin would be a signal of it happening if you ask me), I would leave as soon as possible. 
I've already made sure it would be fairly easy to relocate by having my daughter in an english speaking international preschool, not having any significant amount of capital in physical property and earning money by doing something I can do from anywhere.

My point was that he's already advertised his holdings as publicly as possible since 2012, and the plate doesn't really add that much additional risk so he might as well get it. They guy has been in national media speaking about Bitcoin since the day the media noticed it basically.
To make an analogy, would it be "poor opsec" for Roger Ver to get a  vanity plate with the text "Bcash"? No, obviously not, because everyone already knows he hodls shitcoins.
