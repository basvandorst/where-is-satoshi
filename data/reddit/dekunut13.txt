The people telling you this only want dollar bills in the hopes that the next idiot will give them something for their funny green paper. A currency has value as long as people value it, and it doesn't need to be backed by a commodity or particular service to make this true.

Not op but just keep halving the reward (and eventually allow for denominations smaller than a Satoshi)

Hey I'm not very well read on cryptocurrency but I have a question and hope someone will take the time to answer. Recently I've seen news about a fork called B2X, and previously there was the bitcoin cash fork that most people here say is a scam. My question is, with the existence of the "fork" method of innovating, is there any need for any altcoin? It seems that anyone who was going to do something cool with a new cryptocurrency could just fork bitcoin and have nearly-instant adoption since the fork would honor all previous bitcoin transactions. In fact, it seems to me that Bitcoin could be updated indefinitely simply by forking it and allowing the holders to decide which branch to follow. Creating a new coin would just increase volatility and slow down the adoption process.

if nobody made minimum wage they wouldn't bother adjusting it.

It looks like somebody already beat him to letting the venezuelans know.

1) Being completely off the shelf is never a good thing
2) They could not raise the price high enough to ramp up production fast enough to maintain shelf presence at the rate people were buying cards

You are an idiot but at least your presence here should be evidence that Peterson is not "alt right" since here you are bitching about him.
