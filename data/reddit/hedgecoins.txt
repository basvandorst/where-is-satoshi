I thought my screen had something on it.. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:02:39
Just think, even with China blocking Google, what is the real number. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:16:08
PS. Not real gold. These are cheap but still so COOL
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:10:11
Yes, I paid 50 cents for it. Totally worth it though!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:19:01
Haha, yea you are right

The problem is it has dropped even further to $6800 so it doesn't make since. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:15:46
We're not in 2012 anymore :D
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:23:24
I agree. Leave it to JihanWu to be greedy and scam. Look at Bitmain overselling the D3s. Profitability crashed, difficulties rose. Currently making almost nothing. I know many people still waiting on D3s they preordered 3 months in advance. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:54:36
A golden bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:42:23
Agreed. I feel like it should be priced at around ETH/DASH levels.

@_date: 2017-11-08 00:54:59
Beautiful. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:10:22
Agreed. If people have been following bitcoin closely for the past *few* years, you will see that the "crashes" are roughly 30% at most every time. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:43:20
I agree. I am in China and there are much bigger things going on. First of all, governments in China, Russia and other countries are starting to create their own coins. Japan has legalized it. Australia is talking about doing the same. It is continuing to grow as fintech and blockchain technology become more and more popular. 
To be honest, I don't know to many people that would want to use BTC to pay for dinner. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:17:59
I don't want to reveal this on reddit. 
I can tell you how much each miner makes per month at current coin prices factoring in power costs. 
S9 - $590
L3+ - $445
E9 - $330
We have found that the mining calculator on cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator is accurate if you add about 15% to the power consumption (w) data box. Realistically, your machines will use a little bit more than advertised. 
Since we opened this new farm 14 days ago, we have done about 14% on total investment taking into account the rising prices of BTC and LTC. 
Hope this helps you!

At one point a lot of people considered Jihan Wu and Roger Ver 


No disrespect to anyone that is supporting it, but personally I can accept S9s 10% less hashrate until after people have them in hands. 
If an established company introduced a new model, this wouldn't be the case. However this is the first I'm hearing about halongmining. 
Edit: Also, I have tested some newer brands of Chinese miners and they usually turn out to not be as advertised. For example, they advertise power consumption as 1400W, but once you get it plugged into your farm and let it run for a few days you can see that it is 1650W... I've lived in China for 8 years, and there is really no regulatory body that can protect consumers... LET's SEE
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:50:49
Agreed. And do not forget Bitmain and Jihan Wu. You can only buy their miners with bitcoin cash. Recently changed from only accepting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:53:13
I get paid in BTC, no fiat to buy dip. :(
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:19:18
We need a list of wallets that haven't implemented it. I'll spread it around!
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:34:34
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:32:44


They get a kick out of feeling like a pro day trader. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:26:29
And Jihan Wu
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:38:54
We remained steadfast during one of the biggest and most coordinated attacks on BTC yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:00:45
Don't get paid today :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:02:16
Thanksgiving next year, BTC will be $20,000+ 
remindme! 1 year
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:26:39
I think it is either not as advertised, or a scam. Personally I won't buy it until I see people confirming it is legit. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:28:46


Let us not forget Jihan Wu, CEO of Bitmain. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:38:28
So $20-30k by the end of 2018!

**I am a miner in China. I will continue to mine BTC.**
If B2X does become consistently more profitable than BTC, I'll consider switching over. However, a smarter move would be only moving portion of your miners over to the new B2X. No need to go all in. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:15:32
I hold coins as long as possible. I'm a blockchain and bitcoin believer. 
But once my portfolio gets over a certain amount, I'll liquidate a portion and invest it into real estate or into making my life more comfortable. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:16:57
To be honest, he probably doesn't care. He is making hundreds of millions, if not billions from, not only selling his machines, but mining. He has huge farms. He is more interested in the next pump and dump. 
By March (when dragon mint ships) he will have S11, 19T. Mark my words. He probably is mining with 100,000 S11s as we speak. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:40:39
Every time...

@_date: 2017-09-15 02:32:00
It is a perfect time to start your bitcoin collection :D
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:04:08


No, if China bans mining, the Chinese miners will move their operation right across the border into Mongolia. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 05:19:53
Yes, even fiat can be used for money laundering. Imagine that :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:32:00

Thank you!

Thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:04:29
Probably companies that plan on using it. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:33:41
Thank you. I will have one written tomorrow about how to call the bottom. 
Stay Tuned...
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:02:00
I'm a miner in China, and China is not saying anything about banning miners... This is more FUD. The article says since the exchanges or banned, how will miners pay for the costs to mine. Well simply by buying the hardware with coins form Bitmain or what ever supplier. (they all accept crypto) and or selling the coins on Japanese or foreign exchanges... Chinese still can trade OTC... meaning they can still buy and sell BTC without the exchanges :P
