Why is that a bad thing though? It's a real object that has value.

How are you getting your bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:35:23
If you are investing right now it must be with money that you can afford to lose.
Set a budget for yourself that will not prevent you from being able to pay you or your friends bills.
Spend it.  On bitcoins, on your friends start up, on real estate, on whatever you think will make money for you.
Expect to lose it but hopefully you banked on something that does well.
It's all gambling.

How much did you buy them for?

**You need to be upfront about any an all fees. You are charging people for this service.**

What world do you live in?
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:26:55
Do you charge a fee for every transaction?
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:06:28
There is no egg though. This currency is not based on anything that has value in other markets.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:20:45
Couldn't he or she just use it for their own reasons without being emotional about it?
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:31:42
Well the CEO of bitinstant is 23 and bought a bar in NYC. This is a big investment and takes a hell of a lot of work.
 Maybe he and possibly his associates don't have the time to do both effectively.
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:48:30
Yeah but does this specific escrow service provide any insurance?
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:40:25
1. This sounds more political than sound financial advice.
2. Exchanging bit coins for USD is not that easy or fast from what I understand. 
Can you elaborate on how much time it typically takes to exchange bitcoins to USD and what fees are involved? 
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:51:37
Why didn't you use your local wallet?
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:29:24
How much did you pay for the asics?

Wouldn't it take about over a year to make your money back if the dividend rate stayed the same?
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:35:17
Holy shitballs that was fast. Thanks guys.
How much fucking coffee do you guys drink??

How is this site safer than craigslist? I am not saying that it isn't. I genuinely do not know.
I assume that this site offers some protection against being scammed. How do they offer this if I am correct in my assumptions?

One that has to pay their bills with money that is more widely accepted.
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:58:18
Is there a way to combat fraud within the website?
If I use paypal and there is an issue I can contest the purchase.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:53:28
So to get your money from them you have to send them a ton of personal info?
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:04:16
What will they do when they want to buy groceries or pay bills?
I am from the US, let's say I have $5000 in bitcoins, how do I do I buy a bottle of liquor and some bacon with some of that money?
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:32:51
Why not purchase directly from your local wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-07 05:11:39
I was going to sign up with them to try to sell my bitcoins but they require a lot of personal data for verification.
I do not feel comfortable giving them my personal data.
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:51:53
He is charging a transaction fee and it does not look like he is being up front about it.
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:45:40
I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:56:21
Who knows.   
Remember regardless if you are buying bitcoins or the hardware to make them you are speculating AKA gambling.
Do not spend more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:52:52
What is the transaction fee that the developer is taking out of each transaction?
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:30:07
Holy shit.
@_date: 2013-06-06 03:13:17
2.44 per share?

People who are not critical about the products and services that they use are useless people. In gaming we call them fanboys.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:20:17
You cashed out enough bitcoins to buy a car?
Which service did you use and what currency did you exchange it for?
