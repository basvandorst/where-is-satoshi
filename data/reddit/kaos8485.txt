Your are right but consider people like me have other needs. I really believe in decentralization but after 1 year of holding I had to sell my only BTC making some profit that I’ll invest in a DIY retirement plan coz I’m 32 and with no great future prospects. I regret that i clicked that button because it was my first investment and I was proud being the owner of 1btc. Maybe 1 btc could have been my ticket to financial freedom one day but who knows. I preferred to cash out now and build a portfolio of ETFs and bonds. I’m not a coward but I had to set a SAD exit strategy and at 8000€ I sadly pushed the button. I saw it growing from 1k to 19k and going down for real. I was promising myself that I would have never sold...but life is full of unexpected events and I had to be flexible. (Believe me. I’m fucking sad that I sold)Cheers

Either he is stupid or he thinks he is talking at stupids. 
Let s be honest here. Majority of people watching tv or CNBC don’t know anything about money or how the world really works...
He is basically talking to his public...

Depends when.
Anything can happen. Maybe one day with 90K you can buy a kilo of apples or maybe fiat won’t exists by that time...if it goes up tomorrow I’ll sell a bit and hodl the rest

What makes me confident is to know that crypto and blockchain is a multi billion business that will bring wealth to governments and society.
Since 2008 we saw a crazy money printing from central banks and these new markets offer them a way to recoup and invest in something profitable.
Science and tech are the engine of modern times and I believe this is the next step of wealth for everyone who is invested in it.
Just be patient.

Let s see. The SEC will act considering what happened in the past with other technology related investment... crazy things we know happened with the bubble of the tronics in the 60ies and with the dot.com. The SEC was there but didn’t do a lot, only warning investors. Now the SEC will be more cautious

When is going fast like that is not promising
@_date: 2019-09-23 08:15:04
History tell us that whatever we expect to happen,won’t happen. 
We should stop to predict and guess and let the history do its course.
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:27:17
I believe that we are all poor mortals but some of us like those guys know a little bit more then us...They know what is going on, they are insiders and if they believe something is not profitable they would have left already moving to something even better then this cryptoworld. 
Every day we read about something promising and if u zoom out u understand that seems part of a plan and all the pieces are coming together,slowly. 
Let s see. 
Finger crossed.
