They are so many things envolved that it comes down to luck and talent. Ideas can be bought or copied and connections open up automatically. And even the best ideas and the most powerful connections are worth shit if you are just unlucky.

True that. But cash, unlike bitcoin, becomes very inconvenient in larger quantities as it can’t be transfered fast and effortless. You need to give it to a bank eventually, where it gets noticed by the government.
The only reason you would store your bitcoins in a bank account is increased security. Storing millions of cash in a private vault is very expensive, but for bitcoins, it’s a few encrypted files spread across the net. Doesn’t have to cost you anything at all.
Without a need for a central authority, like a banking system, I would regard bitcoin as anarchist.

How do you define anarchism? I’d say anarchy means that there is no single controlling force, no authority.
How do you enforce taxes on bitcoins?

There was a time when using a computer was confusing and geeky. Now everything is a computer and everybody can use it. Yes, one reason is that interfaces became much easier, but another reason is that there is an incentive to learn how to use a computer, so people just do it.
On the other hand, maybe I’m just an arrogant prick. Over here in Germany nobody has problems with fractions. When I learned about this Verizon incident, I was baffled. I still am. This is something like reading. Not everybody can do it, but it’s expected.

Yes, it is. That’s why there are efforts all over the world to put up censorship and surveillance methods while *trying* to keep privacy breaches not too obvious and the sturdiness high. Which is probably impossible.
But authorities certainly don’t like big things they can’t control, so there will be much bigger oppositions against bitcoin than file sharing if bitcoin should become a relevant payment method.

That was the first thing that came to my mind.
Seriously, if you don’t understand how numbers work, you shouldn’t handle money.

But how does the fed know how much money you have? That’s the tricky part.

Anything that could make you pay taxes, track down money laundering, regulate inflation rates, stuff like that.
For example, if every bitcoin transaction had to be validated by a single server, that server would be the controlling force of the bitcoin network. It could require identification or modify the transaction in such a way that the government would get 10% of the transfered bitcoins.
