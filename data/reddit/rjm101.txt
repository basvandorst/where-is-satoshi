What are the examples of this? Fiat currency is only a few decades old. There are no countries on the gold standard today and none that reverted from their fiat money printing past.
On your note about central banks hoarding gold. Central banks use it as a store of wealth which can be exchanged between other central banks. They don't want to hold each others fiat currency when the central bank can just print more. History has proven that no one central bank can be trusted so they use gold as a substitute. This is where Bitcoin has a great deal of potential as it's easy to transfer vast sums of wealth globally without permission of a central authority versus the physical gold bullion that take months (even years) to transfer and is costly.

You think the gold standard is coming back? Keep wishing. 
Fiat printing is an addiction and trump himself wants to print more in order to 'compete' with nations doing the exact same.

My dad asked questions about it. I gave him links and talks from Andreas to watch. Pretty sure he just ignored all of it. He'd already be up 100% if he just bought some already.

I'd like to know how pull requests are managed on the Bitcoin codebase. Who has the privilege of deciding what pull requests get merged and ultimately isn't this going against decentralisation by giving power to these select few? What criteria's need to be met to get pull requests merged? Is there a minimum number of approvers required? Do certain approvers have more weighting than others? The people who have the privilege of merging code changes have a great deal of power to influence Bitcoins code base which is my main concern and this seems like an easy point of attack to me.

Sadly again this comes down to a lack of understanding on Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't untraceable it's pseudoanonymous and you can follow transactions every step of the way. Here's some [myth debunking]( from a prosecutor who's dealt with a number of big criminal crypto cases.

I don't see this as a bad thing quite the opposite actually. Libra will be the gateway from fiat to libra and you'll be able to transfer Libra to coinbase to exchange it for Bitcoin. It's effectively the on ramp to Bitcoin as I don't see the calibra wallet supporting Bitcoin anytime soon. In fact I would be more worried if there wasn't any crypto exchanges on that list as it would had suggested a distancing away from conventional crypto. At least one of libra cofounders [consider themselves a Bitcoiner]( but before you say 'well why don't they just support Bitcoin?' look at how much push back they are getting just for a stablecoin lol.

Coinbase has always been a slow mover for some reason. I came across this [coinbase blog]( which claims to be rolling out segwit but I don't see it on my account at least.

Miners are incentivized to operate where there is cheap electricity. Have you considered why it is cheap? If the electricity is cheap it's because there is excess supply vs demand. If there was no excess then it wouldn't be cheap and if other people start wishing to use the same source prices will increase and miners may eventually seek other alternative sources.
With a lot of these renewable sources, it's not as simple as just turning it off which is why there can be an excess supply. Mother nature doesn't stop and if miners are willing pay this can actually mean these renewable operations can reach breakeven far quicker.

I understand what you mean but I think the time it's going to take for Bitcoin to replace gold in some areas is greatly underestimated. I don't think we're talking years but rather decades. Gold will certainly be hard to replace in some societies where it's more embedded into religion and of course it's uses as a physical precious metal won't change. For now gold and silver serves as the foundation of my portfolio and I have Bitcoin for the future potential.

Bought crypto and then bought these physical coins simply because they looked cool and it would be nice to have something tangible for once. Then later I bought a real 1 oz gold coin plus some other bullion bars which are way better and actually worth something. If you want tangible wealth there's no substitute for physical gold &amp; silver.

This data probably doesn't exist but I'm curious to know the percentage of Bitcoin block rewards accounted for in Bitcoins overall supply in the market? I'm curious to know because of the halvening next year. If Bitcoin miners account for a large percentage of the overall supply then this warrants a greater weighting as an influential factor for Bitcoins price versus if it only accounted for a small percentage.

I did this with 4 dog tags and a key ring with some letter stamps. The idea is that I can split up the dog tags to different people. It pretty much took me 5 hours to do it. Letter stamping is tricky to get right. It saved me a little money in the end and I can hide dog tags a lot more easily compared to cryptosteel. I also never liked the idea of the cryptosteel logo being on there. Someone who has no idea about cryptos will get a clue from that logo with my dog tags someone can mistake it for a strange necklace.

The biggest issue is not being able to cash out your forked coins in a timely fashion. If you use the vault feature this is neat but you'll be scrambling to withdraw it in time before a fork and may even be backlogged. The vault feature has something like an intensional 3 day delay. Just get a hardware wallet and have full control.

Bitstamp also let you withdraw and take [delivery of gold bars]( I'm not sure if this is available in Australia though.

Big corrections like this is normal for Bitcoin if you know its history. Bitcoin being as volatile as it is means it can quickly pick back up.
