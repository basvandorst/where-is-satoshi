i'm using the same analysis that all these "experts" who predict it to hit $100k are using... complete guessing.

it's not a good price. this thing should be worth like $500 max when all is said and done.

otc equity and other shitty investments are also legitimate assets

forreal though. 1-3k is still tooooooo rich. it is going to go down to $500, but more likely $5. they had a cute idea but other coins are better.

it died in july 2016 and again in september 2016. then again today. i counted them on my fingers.

exactly, bitcoin hasn't been around long enough to have a history. there were basically two dips in its history, in july 2016 and august 2016. 
this isn't a "keep hold everything is gonna be fine." i think you mean to say "guy please hold because i want you guys to hold, even though i have no idea if when more and more people see the news today and sell, the whole market will crash further on monday."

like how they fell for bitcoin

You gonna HODL until it reaches $500, which is still VERY overvalued?

i thought bitcoin was for a deregulated and decentralized value exchange system?

i'm more qualified to give financial advice than the people on this sub saying it's going to hit $30k, or even reach $20k again.

i'm not even salty. just speaking my honest opinion.
dont put money into bitcoin if you want to make any returns. only buy bitcoin if you want to buy goods/services using bitcoin.

ah yes, switch from getting fucked by elected officials to getting fucked by random crypto executives and chinese miners and market makers. lmao. this is hilarious.
