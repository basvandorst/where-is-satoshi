Now I'm even more confused on how shorts work. I thought it was just betting with someone that the price will fall. Time to do some googling

1) Closing a short is when you get that the price will fall, and when proven correct you take your profits right?
2) Margins called: that is when you are trading with someone else's money and begin to lose more than what you have in your shunts so the platform closes your trade?

Is it possible to arbitrage crypto currencies? I thought that wasn't possible because of fees or something else

I don't understand your comment (new to trading), can you elaborate a little?
Are you saying people are selling bitcoin in chunks of thirty and twenty bitcoin and that's a sign that the price will fall?
