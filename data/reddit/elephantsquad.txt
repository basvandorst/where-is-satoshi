Ahhh I see. I guess my mistake is not entirely understanding the technology of these coins. I have a good understanding of btc and I have a technical background so I have a reasonable grasp of the roadmap. I hadn’t don’t a whole lot of research on other coins scalability though. I had essentially assumed they were more well equipped because they could maybe learn from design mistakes of btc. I kind of just assumed a coin like ltc was more well equipped to tackle these issues because of the general ideas I’ve seen on this sub.

I respectfully disagree about 15k. Times seem rough rn I agree, but I swear every time I think this thing is going to sink 5k it sinks 2 then blows up lol

For the low low price of $30 you can wait 10 hours to transfer your bitcoin that you have to convert into USD before spending. Truly a economy-breaking currency.

When you have to explain BTC like an early access game on steam you can probably see why some of us never bothered.

People have been working on it for a decade and after all that time we have one improvement: the price.

"The tech looks solid."
"The dev team behind it are incredibly passionate and bright"
"I've read their white paper"

Lol respect for that. I am a software dev and truly believe in the tech. Sure, maybe BTC won't be the golden child that relinquishes society of any hold banks have on the monetary system, but I hope a good coin, with good developers does.

How is it that every time I see an explanation of why BTC is the future the entire explanation is why BTC is utter shit?
