How would you buy the gold? The government can track that you purchased the gold, the government tracks any purchases of assets, especially if you are buying large amount.  The only true way your gold is anonymous is if you actually mined the gold yourself.  
My point was the amount of difficulty and resources needed to hide $1million dollars of gold vs $1million dollars in Bitcoin is self evident.

Assuming you kept your wallet and private key secret and didn't tell anyone.  You can truly keep your wealth hidden to a certain degree than any other asset class.  If you go around singing how much Bitcoin you have, no blockchain can protect stupidity.  The user needs to take an amount of precaution to stay anonymous.

Yes, I agree not all wallets are in danger, but it's safe to say many more exposed their publickey vs those that never reused an address.  
The impossible becomes possible by using Shor's algorithm, theoretically it is possible.  Quantum computers may not offer much advantage over classical computers, but when it comes to solving certain problems, QC is much faster.  One of them happens to be Shors algo.  I am no expert and sure there are others who can elaborate better than I can, still trying to learn and educating myself.  I do know it is a threat and it shouldn't go ignored.  It's not matter of IF it will, all matter of when.

He asked something along the line of if cryptocurrency can be a threat to fed policy in the future and does it directly impacts the U.S dollar currency.  (The senator was making a point about how dollar is the leading currency in the world and it helps the economy in a great way, how the raise of cryptocurrency threatens U.S stronghold on the global currency market)
The stream should be available to view on the House.gov by tomorrow or I am sure it's on YouTube.  The question was asked towards the very end, apologies I couldn't record in time to get the question asked.

Same can happen to Bitcoin, except this time, a quantum computer with 50 qubits can take any public key and solve the private key by running Shor's Algorithm.  Some call it Y2Q.

Yes wealth management, trusting other people with your money.  There exists a risk right there off the bat, trust...I don't like the word trust and money in the same sentence, it shouldn't even be subject of discussion when it comes to trust, BTC gets the point for this since it eliminates trust.  In my own conclusion, Bitcoin holds the least risk factors, for a store of value asset, logistic, privacy, ease of transfer etc etc (strickly based on my opinion and not bashing gold).
Also, I read recently there is an asteroid in our solar system that is rich in elements such as gold, especially gold.  Supply is very important in any asset to retrain and gain value.  As technology advances, mining gold becomes more efficient, it will flood the market causing prices to crash.  I wouldn't hide something that don't have finite amount of supply.  It's worth hiding rare paintings, just not gold.
@_date: 2019-07-30 19:47:48
yes it can, but there will be plenty of engineering challenges, even if every single wallet holder migrated to the new wallet, there are still Satoshi's wallet and many idle wallets with forgotten keys.  All of those wallets will be targeted.  Those wallets  will never be safe from a QC attack.  Will not happen anytime soon, but Bitcoins ECDSA can be cracked.

It's slowly planting the seed in older generations head.  Unfortunately gold is mostly held by people that are not technology savvy.  The baby boomer generation is about to retire at a high rate, they will sell their investments such as gold and equities, some will pass on wealth to their children, and that generation is the one that will seek alternative store of value.  The process of gaining a chunk of the 7 trillion dollars from the gold market will take time.  Money at that scale moves very gradually.  The fact that Fed Chairman compared Bitcoin with gold is a huge confirmation that BTC is here to stay and can only gain market share.  His statement is a conviction many were hoping to see, usually the Fed is very evasive about cryptocurrency questions.  In his statement he specifically mentions Bitcoin and compared it to a heavily traded global commodity like gold.

It's a very heavy element logistics can become complicated when you try to move and hide millions of dollars worth of gold.

 I am not sure how time value of money concept can't apply to Bitcoin.
"The time value of money (TVM) is the concept that money available at the present time is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received."

Usually volatility during certain time of the day, at least I've noticed.  U.S afternoon time after Equity market closes and another obvious one is when Asian market wakes up, around 9pm Eastern.  In my experience some of the big moves happned late night around 3-5am.  
On the time &amp; sales (market history).  Look for large BTC market orders to go off one after another in a very short span of time.  A good indication of short term volume/volatility on its way.

No, 0 transaction took place on the new wallet.  Atleast for now the buyer didn't sell or move anything.  In my opinion, these are Family Businesses or big players, I don't expect them to sell anytime soon.

Buy and HODL before the big boys do their HODL through NYSE.
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:27:43
Did some chain analysis on mt gox recent transaction of 8000btc.  The Bitcoins were transferred to a newly created wallet.  0 BTC is spent from that wallet.  Most likely this was an OTC sale to a private buyer, far as I can tell, no trades were done via exchange.   This is a very good news, looks like he is selling mostly to private whales that are in it to HODL.

@_date: 2018-05-03 04:08:59
Why would I spend my BTC right now on anything?  I know the time value of my BTC and it's worth far more than todays price. Fiat has no supply limit, I can get a job that pays me in fiat, so you see I am not too concerned about using/spending my fiat, if it had a max supply of 21million and each can be broken down to 100million than the situation would be different.  
At current price, spending your BTC to purchase goods or services is super dumb money.

Seriously a clown like you teaching me time value of money smh.  Getting my BTC NOW is better than getting it later, I can buy ALTs when my BTC is worth more, or lend it to earn interest and many other ways of using BTC to appreciatevalue.  So please dumb ass explain what part of appreciation of value do you not understand.  Fuck a finance class, you need to practice common sense 1st.
You sound like a salty person who prob shorted BTC recently and became poor lol I hope you stay that way forever.  I turned 0.02btc into  1.5XBT this month from trading futures, go check out my other post you pleb.  I don't have time to discuss redundant shit with you because you feel the need to be ignorant.  
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:13:57
1.5XBT in 48 hours and you are making a fool out of yourself on Reddit, now I call bullshit on your whole life.
$200 is all I needed to risk when I knew my entry is near perfect.  That's a nano portion of my portfolio used to buy btc futures and I am happy with my return.  You're talking out your ass to the wrong person bud.  I have executed more trades in a day than you did in your whole life in my profession. 
Yes, I did give my father back his money.  Anything wrong with borrowing money from family?  At least I have a story to tell, a positive one.  You have nothing I bet, besides negative p&amp;l and broken monitors.
I really dont give a fuck what you have to say, I pass on knowledge and information for others to learn from my trading success/failure.  I am transparent about it, not sure why you going all personal lol this is where I know you have poor emotional intelligence.  Read my shit, learn instead of attacking me for an arbitrary reason.  If you have anything of value to add do it, so far you just sound like an angry person with some serious life issues who is a closet Bitcoin hater.  Don't call me a gambler because that's what you tend to do when you are given 100X leverage.

Check your email, you have to click on the link sent to your email to approve an withdrawal.  Do you guys not read instructions?  Or don't know the process to withdrawal?  A lot of the issues I hear about exchanges come from the ignorance of the user.  
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:58:42
So you didn't take your shitcoin out before it got delisted?  I remember them giving plenty of announcement and emails regarding future delisting.  Don't blame an exchange because you just left your shitcoin there and neglected their notifications.  You failed to withdrawal in the given time frame, the fault is yours.  Stop creating this FUD.  I been using Polo since early 2017, never had an issue.  I am down voting this, I hate to see an isolated incident by an irresponsible trader ruin a perfectly legit exchange.
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:34:48
If you owned the coin, they sent you emails about delisting announcements.  Stop feeling like a victim and also stop using an exchange to store shitcoins for extended periods of time, dumbass.  
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:23:05
They are trying to be a regulated exchange and thinking long term.  The days of trading by using just an email are gone, especially when value of the market is so large and significant.  This is a good thing for crypto, fixes the image of bitcoin.  It is no longer a darknet currency or considered shady to buy.  Too many financial crime using cryptocurrencies, regulations just makes it difficult for criminals to cash out.  If you want the market to increase in trillions, if you want to attract institutional investors, you must support some regulatory implementation.  Not everyone plays nice, and big money likes security and insurance on their money.  A proper regulated exchange can provide that assurance when a whale invests millions, knowing it is a government regulated entity and some type of accountability is provided.

I know this is a late reply, but I feel it's important the public stays updated on the new advances in QC research that can solve the very existing problems you've listed.  
uranium ditelluride (UTe2) has topological SC properties.  This new material can eliminate the need for error correctness and the qubits will maintain superconductivity on the surface of the material, ignoring environmental disturbance.
 
None of this will happen overnight,  but advancement in the field is accelerating.  In the community I am in, many of the members who are very knowledgeable in this field, majority  believe QC will break ECDSA in 10 years or less.
@_date: 2019-08-17 13:31:14
You can also find many more information on this subject here, it's very difficult to argue against their position.

One reputable fund manager can easily raise $1 billion plus from clients.  So imagine the wave it will create in future, of course SEC has to be investor friendly when dealing with this market.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:22:39
Supply and demand.  Along with assuming SEC approves bitcoin ETFs in the next year.  Few billion dollars is not much for one fund manager.  I assure you, a bum rush of Wall Street money will flood the crypto space.  Every one laughed at me when I said bitcoin will be $4200 post SegWit Aug 1st, wasent a laughing matter to me.  I read somewhere, only 1% of the world population knows about cryptocurrency, and about 60% of those have money invested.  FOMO will be strong when it goes mainstream.  Just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:40:30
I hate when people use the word "bubble" in crypto space.  A bubble usually happens or are predicted for investment instruments with earnings, revenues and other economical  conditions that impact the value of the investment.  I don't like the idea of putting a value on blockchain, because the technology behind it and has it's own valuation that can't be measured with formulas taught in text books.  Those that don't see the true long term value of crypto usually have a one dimensional approach to calculating investment valuation.  
By Fall 2018 SEC should announce ETF approval, however with strick restrictions attached, possibly injecting trillions into the market from hedge funds to 401k funds.  Equity market is already overvalued, investors are looking elsewhere to move cash.
Bitcoin should peek around $55k by 2022, then it will become more of a commodity, a digital storage of large wealth.  10% swings days will be gone.  It will not be used for day to day transaction, rather a digital wealth storage for the rich.
