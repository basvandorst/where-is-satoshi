This won't be appropriate for large amounts but I've been thinking [Bitrefill]( would be useful for small international payments. 
They sell cell phone minutes for bitcoin in 123 countries, including India.
It could be useful as a way to cash out bitcoin tips (into minutes) hassle free.

I'm really keen to help make tipping go viral. I've got $40 ready to contribute tomorrow
I think we need to get 10 or 15 bitcoiners to club together and target one particular twitter account, one particular youtube channel and one particular thread in a popular subreddit.
We should all look out for finance/money threads that are relevant and then each tip $5 to the top ~10 comments and then throw around a few cents to people who ask about bitcoin
I think a 'cool' finance youtube channel is our best bet
And a twitter account of someone/company for genuinely useful consumer advice. 
OR maybe something like  
Basically I think we need to target popular places that people who think they're smart about money hang out
What do you think? Maybe and would be interested
edit: I also think we should have a few lines of text to post with each tip directing people to where they can spend &lt;$1 on digital goods and explaining that bitcoin is the internet of money etc. It needs to be glaringly obvious that bitcoin lets you throw around real money over the internet like it's a piece of cake. That alone will demonstrate how many of bitcoins best use cases can work

Agriculture is certainly not the best idea humanity has ever had
Where in nature do you see monocultures of crops? Where do you see unsustainable use of resources?
The natural system is the most efficient there is, and maintains itself without human effort
The decentralisation of food and resources is coming, and it's called Permaculture. 
The natural system but managed to maximum efficiency with minimal human input required. Everyone will grow their own food, or rather everyone's food will be growing itself right next to where they live

Colony Earth and places like it use a sustainable business model that promotes permaculture development across the world while creating profit. 
Permacredits are a cryptocurrency used by permaculture projects across the world and holders of permacredits are rewarded with a share of the profits of these permaculture businesses.
Permaculture is a design system that mixes natural systems and human sustainable existence. Humanity can be as much as a positive force in the health of the Earth as they have been a destructive one in the past and natural systems can be enhanced with human involvement to move towards a state of even higher stability and productivity.

One goal would be to inspire content creation, but another would be to put all this information in one place. A one link fits all for consumer information on bitcoin. 
But I've no idea how to make a website so if the information is gathered in a few reddit threads someone else can take it from there
I think tipping will be much more effective once people understand that the changetip bot is legit and not trying to scam them.
Having to connect a social media account is a quite a big barrier to entry I think. Not even my friends on twitter followed the link.
I think adding a bit of info on how to make a quick throwaway reddit account to claim it that way instead could help

Bitcoin is programmable money, correct?
Surely there is a way for a bitcoin processor (bitpay, coinbase, or a newcomer) to integrate ways to refund the money if too much is paid or if the guaranteed exchange rate expires?
I'm thinking at checkout the customer is shown the usual QR code/URI with payment information built in but is ALSO requested an optional refund bitcoin address. 
The bitcoin address associated with the QR code/URI displayed on checkout could be linked (in their API(?)) to the specific time that the payment will expire. Should that address receive funds AFTER that time, the code dictates that the funds be sent to the refund address given by the customer. 
If the time has not expired but the paid amount is greater than requested, the difference could be returned to the same given refund address
Is this feasible?
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:19:23
Are you saying that people shouldn't be trusted to spend their own money?
People will spend their money where they feel they will benefit most.
If you live in a poor area of a Western country and someone is advertising an idea to save 2 months worth of rent money and instead of giving it to landlords, do things themselves. If they were to purchase some land and build a safe high density suburb that grows all it's own food and collects it's own water. (As one of many examples)
You think that with an idea like that, people will still spend their 'tax money' on things that benefit the status quo?
I fail to see why people can't be trusted to decide directly where a large percentage of their income goes.

Permacredits are the 1st commodity backed crypto currency. This is bitcoin 2.0 in action. Permacredits or "credits" are created as a way for the world to engage in and actively support the world of Permaculture and Eco Developments while enjoying profits from that world.

Multisig with crowd-sourced oracles should work for that
I had an idea about the third party needed to deliver packages. 
What about a 'tinder' style app that matches you with people that want to pay bitcoin to deliver a package.
That could be a delivery from one end of your city to another, or it could be a payment per kilometer. You take it as far as you can and then advertise on the app that you have a parcel that pays 'x per km' and pass the parcel on to someone else.
Each courier could have commit to burn or hold in escrow a certain amount of bitcoin to make theft unprofitable.
In a busy city mail could take hours to arrive, or in more remote regions it might take longer than usual. But it would still provide another option

You can negate volatility in a decentralized, trust-free way with assets on the bitshares blockchain. 
Accept bitcoin --&gt; trade to bitUSD --&gt; trade back to bitcoin to pay suppliers
BitUSD is created using a prediction market. Two parties enter into a trade, one in a short position and the other long in a completely decentralised and anonymous way. 
I don't see bitshares as a competing currency to bitcoin. Bitcoin provides immense security, and bitshares provides features not available in bitcoin. They are complimentary
Soon SPV smartphone wallets will be released, and anyone in the world will be able to hold their crypto pegged to their local fiat currency without banks, KYC, AML or asking permission.
The problem of volatility has been solved in a decentralised way
Here's some idea of how it works:
Alice wants to reserve her purchasing power in USD and Bob thinks that bitshares will rise against USD. Alice gives her bitshares to Bob, knowing that he will guarantee their purchasing power in USD. Bob now has the profit potential of Alice's bitshares (leverage) but he also must pay Alice extra if bitshares fall in price vs USD (risk).
Bob gives Alice an IOU of USD, this IOU is called BitUSD. But as Alice can sell her bitUSD to anyone (not just bob) maybe calling it an 'anyone owes you' AOU is more appropriate.
Bob must provide 200% collateral (in bitshares) to this position which will be used to automatically close the position if/when 150% of the collateral (in bitshares) is needed to pay Alice (or any BitUSD holder) back their USD value in bitshares. I.e when bitshares have crashed against USD and so Bob now needs to spend more bts for them to be worth the same amount of USD. If 150% of the collateral is needed, the trade is automatic.
Bob does not need to be paid back by Alice in particular, just anyone selling bitUSD.
Bob profits if bitshares (bts) rises against usd, and Alice profits if bts falls against USD.

He shows that the removal of secret ballots in congress in the 1970's has led to vote buying and given financial elites control of politics in the US. 
The solution is a cardboard box to cover their hands as they vote. 
Apparently new research has concluded that the likelihood of a bill passing is strongly correlated with the preferences of financial elites.
The chances of a bill popular with the general public passing is 30%. 
The chances of an unpopular bill is also 30%. 
Data can now prove that the people are not represented in US politics

Soon SPV smartphone wallets will be released, and anyone in the world will be able to hold their crypto pegged to their local fiat currency without banks, KYC, AML or asking permission. 
The problem of volatility has been solved in a decentralised way
Here's some idea of how it works:
Alice wants to reserve her purchasing power in USD and Bob thinks that bitshares will rise against USD. 
Alice gives her bitshares to Bob, knowing that he will guarantee their purchasing power in USD. 
Bob now has the profit potential of Alice's bitshares (leverage) but he also must pay Alice extra if bitshares fall in price vs USD (risk). 
Bob gives Alice an IOU of USD, this IOU is called BitUSD. But as Alice can sell her bitUSD to anyone (not just bob) maybe calling it an 'anyone owes you' AOU is more appropriate. 
Bob must provide 200% collateral (in bitshares) to this position which will be used to automatically close the position if/when 150% of the collateral (in bitshares) is needed to pay Alice (or any BitUSD holder) back their USD value in bitshares. 
I.e when bitshares have crashed against USD and so Bob now needs to spend more bts for them to be worth the same amount of USD. If 150% of the collateral is needed, the trade is automatic. 
Bob does not need to be paid back by Alice in particular, just anyone selling bitUSD
Bob profits if bitshares (bts) rises against usd, and Alice profits if bts falls against USD.

The MM businesses could unload their cash by offering to buy bitcoin from customers 
If they set an attractive rate that is also cheaper than the cost of cash transportation then everyone wins.

This is great, thanks. It describes exactly what I was thinking of
The video shows a popular bitshares blogger talking about developments in the last 50 days and estimates that by Q2 of this year SPV wallets will be able to hold bitcoin and instantly convert between bitshares assets which will enable the functionality provided by Bitpay in the 1st world in a decentralised way to the unbanked in the rest of the world.
He says the first rule of business is that if you help people get what they want then you will get what you want. It's the collaborative nature of decentralised systems that will enable rapid change

Lens allows you to spend bitUSD on any bitcoin address. 
Using the bitshares client to hold bitUSD and this shapeshift browser extension bitcoin users are able to mitigate volatility risk in a decentralised way, very cheaply. 
Soon bitreserves 1% fee(?) and coinapult Locks 0.45% fee will be uncompetitive
