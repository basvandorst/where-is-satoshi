From your link:
"In June 2010, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said $557 billion was spent to subsidize fossil fuels globally in 2008, compared to $43 billion in support of renewable energy."
Key points to notice: 
1) Those numbers measure *Global* subsidies. The President of the United States is not going to be able to end or possibly even affect fossil fuel subsidies to any real degree across the globe.
2) This data is nearly 10 years old.
"In a July 2011 EIA report on federal fossil fuel subsidies, coal was estimated to have tax expenditures (provisions in the federal tax code that reduce the tax liability of firms) with an estimated value of $561 million in FY 2010, down from $3.3 billion in FY 2007.[2]"
Key point to notice: The coal industry has had a huge drop in Federal Tax subsidies in more recent times, being around $561 million in 2010 and I believe even less today.

Well it seems he knowingly had sex with a prostitute, which seems like a terrible idea for a political leader. And we know the girl was 16, so he was shopping for someone who looked pretty young. That’s some edgy stuff for someone who had serious ambitions to gain political influence and power.
But hey - if found guilty, he’ll still get the experience of going door-to-door to introduce himself to locals.

It’s less a matter of Christian morality than it is of judgement. Prostitution is against the law yet he chose to break the law - and in a very sloppy and traceable way. So if he’s going to break that law, what other laws is he going to break for his own personal gain or satisfactions?
And that’s before we get into the underage part where this girl apparently looked even younger than 16. What’s *that* about? The guy is 30 years old and is seeking sex with much younger appearing women? I mean, ok, but it would be smart to pick someone who looked to be of legal age, not magically trust that the prostitute didn’t lie when she clicked the “I am 18 or over.” on the site he used. Doing that has placed the whatever he wanted to do politically - to say nothing of his actual future (where he can live, jobs, travel, etc) - in severe jeopardy. 
If he wanted to bang a very young-looking woman without running into this level of trouble, he should have been very rigorous in checking out her credentials in advance. He apparently did not and that is not an indicator of someone who has control over their sexual desires.
Also, why do you “seriously doubt he knowingly had sex with an underage girl”? Do you know him personally or are you just blanket defending a man that you saw on the Internet and you like for completely unrelated and non-contradictory (he could be a pedo AND be a tech gun advocate) reasons? What is the basis of your defense?

Best guess: she lied. Much like teenage boys do for porn sites, to watch trailers for explicit Steam games, or many Americans did about their location during last year’s token frenzy. 


Well, the state says that they have pictures of his dick that he sent her, that the girl sent him pictures of her body, that they have him on video meeting up, and she said she was paid. If all of that doesn’t come to pass then it looks like Cody would be in the clear and it would be the state who has egg on their face.

Card? I’m observing that the American judicial system cannot be said to be fair - which is in agreement with your own assertion that there’s corruption in the system. However overall, White males tend to have better outcomes than many other groups. *shrug* It is what it is. If you’re taking the counter position that this is not the case, you have a mountain of lengthy statistical evidence at multiple levels (arrests, bail amounts, charges, plea offerings, convictions, sentencing, executions, etc) to counter. 


Read again. I said the state is not *supremely* corrupt because they didn’t pursue Ross with charges that may have been difficult to prove. True corrupt states would charge and convict him anyway. Might have [edit: even been executed] or he might have suddenly “suicided” in prison. 
In all, however, I am completely fine with waiting for the trial. We can see what evidence the state has, how Cody pleas, and what a jury says after they hear the case (if it goes that far). However I refuse to accept the idea that **because** Cody is some “political dissident”, it is therefore completely unpossible that he hired a 16 year old prostitute to sexually gratify him. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 17:02:40
I’m not attacking a man - I’m pointing out what the public charges are and the evidence the state has as reflecting extremely poor judgement. When the cops say they have nudes swapping and video of people going AND the prostitute is making the claim that they engaged in a relationship, that looks pretty bad. 
But you said you seriously doubled the veracity of the charges - on what basis do you do this? How familiar are you with the man and/or his sex life?
I don’t know if Kavanaugh is guilty or not, but I think the charges against him are serious, credible, and an investigation should be conducted. Going beyond the basic he/she said situation, the accuser placed a third person in the room who could easily stand up and under oath say that the accuser is lying or incorrect. It would cost him nothing to do this, legally. That he has not done so is pretty suspicious.

1) So why are conservatives getting banned while liberals are free to trash whoever and use “hate speech”.
Who is Apple banning from posting content on the Internet? How? Do you even understand what you are talking about?
2) “BIG TECH has a monopoly on the internet.” 
How exactly? You can pull a domain, have it hosted anywhere in the world, throw up a WordPress blog and say what you want. Send the link to friends. That’s hardly a monopoly.
You may not have the right to post whatever you want on other people’s platforms - can’t post dickpics on Facebook, praise Nazis on Twitter, or praise lynching photos on Instagram, but that’s a part of their terms of service. You can either use another platform that will allow you to post your content (like how Liveleak hosts violent/explicit content, PornHub will let you post sexual content, etc) or even a lower-tier service which is less picky (depending on laws.) Pretty much you really can’t post child porn anywhere, though. That’s about the extent of real censorship, which I am in favor of.
3) “Do you think running a country is a little more complicated then “trump understands trade”!”
I do. I also have seen Trump’s approach and schedule to running the country and I am not impressed. The guy “works” basically 2 hours a day signing shit he doesn’t understand and then tweets or golfs the rest of the time. 
4) “BIG TECH (do you get a nickel every time you say that?) is too powerful but they can be broken up.”
Again, what or who would be broken up and how and on what legal grounds? Please be very specific.
5) If trump does it he will be one of the best presidents in history. 
No, he’s a pretty shitty president, surrounded by pretty shitty people, many of which have resigned, are in jail, under indictment, or are under federal and state investigation. His legacy is going to be one of incompetence mixed with corruption.

2) Nobody said this girl looked like a high school senior. According to police, she looked even younger than her age, which might have been used as a selling point to Cody. 
3) Nobody has said she was hot. 
4) You may be right in that many men might choose to have sex with a willing 16 year old girl if given the opportunity. However the law Cody was subject to not only said he could not hire a woman to have sex with him, but he could also not have sex with a female under the age of 17. Yet it appears that he that and did it in a very traceable way. This does not make him look to be very smart on many levels.

2) If it’s between iOS and the focused attention of just one advanced state, my money is on the state. 
3) Those states often work with private sector companies to come up with their solutions. 
4) People who work for those kinds of companies, people who want to work for those kinds of companies by showing what they can do, and people who can’t work for those kinds of companies because of different philosophies or criminal records or some such attend DEF CON.

Walk over here with me a moment, would you?
Remember that observatory that was closed down by the FBI recently? People had all kinds of speculative theories as to what happened, ranging all the way to First Contact scenarios. Well, no, it looks like this was an FBI raid on someone - apparently the night janitor - [who was downloading and distributing child porn.]( They tracked to a laptop that seems to be his, the timing is right (his was the one shift that matched up with distro), he seems a little unhinged, and so forth. 
Can I say that the janitor was the one downloading and distributing porn? No. Hell, this guy hasn’t even been charged! And I think if he is, he certainly warrants a trial to try to absolutely sort out what’s been going on there. However do I think that the janitor is most likely responsible? Yes. That’s a ton of circumstantial evidence that weighs against him. Still, the state needs to prove their case.
In Cody’s case, they have circumstantial evidence - videos, pictures, phone records but even more than circumstantial, there’s a witness/participant in the crime who has pointed a finger at him and said, “He did this.” 
Now if I was kinda sure about the night janitor being responsible for the porn distribution in the observatory, I’ve got to be a notch more sure about Cody because there’s an actual other person involved who is risking sanction if they are found to be lying. Again, I don’t think it’s enough to skip a trial, but right now, but the same “state’ that’s pointing a finger to that night janitor for doing X is pointing to Cody and saying he did y. It’s possible that the state could be making up one or both accusations, but I just don’t have a reason to suspect that right now.
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:34:46
I disagree - the problem is that Bitcoin is fundamentally designed to be traceable. Every transaction can be tracked - that’s not a bug, it’s a core feature. Once you look at Bitcoin that way, it’s obvious that anonymous transactions were never really going to be a thing. Like you said, as soon as there is one leak - a process error, a cookie grab, or a software glitch in something you think is secure - all your obfuscation efforts are for naught - possibly for your entire bitcoin purchasing history dating back years.
Oh, is Amazon tracking this stuff? Sure. They don’t want to get burned by bad actors (lie to me and tell me there are no scammers in crypto who would leap at the chance to rip off Amazon) or risk liability from the government over accepting funds from questionable sources (same challenge, although now we’re money laundering crypto through Amazon gift cards or whatever is flippable). That’s what business does - and like I pointed out, there are plenty of businesses who do the same thing. And where there aren’t businesses doing it, there are academics. And where there aren’t businesses or academics, there are governments, there are hobbyists, and there are bad actors.
To think of Amazon as “the enemy” comes across as being really short-sighted and kind of naive. If you really want to attack something, go after the KYC laws (good luck!) because generally, that’s the foundation of what makes the intrinsically-traceable Bitcoin so trivial to peg to the person. 
Well, that and using Bitcoin to ship a box to your house.

The idea that there I may wind up with "XT coins which potentially might not have any value in the future" seems to be absurd. If there are "XT coins", then that means that the 75% threshold has been reached previously and the majority of active players in the Bitcoin system have "voted" accordingly.
I am also against what I cannot help but see as widespread censorship by many on the anti-XT side. I strongly question their motivations and self-interests. Their efforts to silence discourse, ban people, and remove links - more than anything else - is what I see as being incredibly destructive to Bitcoin's future and I hope they fail.

I’m not sure there was ever a time in this country’s history - or that of any other - where one could say that the system was never *not* corrupt. Examples can be found at any time in history. However at the same time it ought to be realized that there are definitely degrees of corruption within in any system. Net-net, I don’t think this system is particularly egregiously corrupt - not against White males, anyway (statistically speaking). 
Looping back to your opener, nobody can really say that Ross wasn’t DPR because he was dumb enough to stay in the US *and* be caught while fully logged into his laptop. You can criticize the charges brought against him in other areas, but to my understanding, those charges were ultimately dismissed. If anything, that’s an indicator that the state is not supremely corrupt because in a heavily corrupt system, he would have been tried and found guilty of anything despite the objections of defense, the press, or other parties. Hell, he might well have been executed under many corrupt systems.

Don’t we need a new computation here? Yes, if it were to replace US dollars, it might then be valued at X, but as Bitcoin is state-agnostic, it would also be likely - in terms of availability and utility - to simultaneously make substantial inroads against the Euro, the Yuan, and other such paper money forms to at least some degree. That says to me it would have an even higher valuation before it actually replaced US dollars.

Why do you believe that this threshold is subjective in terms of being invalid or otherwise illegitimate? Because from my understanding, the entire Bitcoin system today hinges on 51% consensus, substantially less than 75%.


This sounds like FUD. If XT triggers, then the Bitcoin system will be BitcoinXT which will be Bitcoin. For all intents and purposes, it will remain Bitcoin with the potential for larger blocks and, as a result, less of a backlog as we have seen in the - also subjective/arbitrary - 1Mb blocks we "enjoy" today. If basically the whole fleet turns in a direction, that's the way we will all sail.


Based on issues you have mentioned with Coinbase in other replies, I am doubting you had any business there in the first place. The issues you brought up - not having private keys, Coinbase being run according to banking regulation, etc - these critiques all existed long before the contemporary block size came into being, let alone Coinbase's recent announcement. If you truly felt having private keys was important, you never would have given them your business in the first place because as the strong key holders often remind us - XT or Core - if you don't have the keys, you don't have the coins.

They are accepting them but they have several payment options available and not all of them can (or should) exist "above the fold" in a way.  It makes a strong case for them to put a Bitcoin option more prominently because they are receiving more value in Bitcoin than those other payment options.

I think the point is, you don't actually *have* the Bitcoins.  Even the transferring you are talking about is really just changing entries the decentralized ledger in the Blockchain.  Here's an example that illustrate what I'm thinking (and if it's technically bad, please explain):
You create a key pair, assign a couple coins to the public key and then print out the keys twice, each on a sheet of paper.  I then go to Spain with my copy and you take yours and go to France.  
Where are the Bitcoins?  Did you take them to France or do I have them in Spain?  Are they in both places?  If yes, then if you burn your piece of paper with the private key, did the bitcoins immediately "move" to me?   
Or let's look at the front end - we post the public key to a website hosted in Norway.  Since the coins can only be accessed by a keyholder, if someone "sends" us a bitcoin while we are on our travels, did the money "go" to the website in Norway, or to either/both of us in Spain or France?
What I'm trying to say is that I think most border conventions are not really geared up to handle crypto currencies.  I'm glad at least the UK is prepared to admit it.

Yes, but that would be with their system, not mine.  They don't need to have internet connectivity for my bartender buddy to see me send my tab to a standing backup wallet that the bar uses and verify it.


Totally agree - although at this bar, they recharge phones.  :)


And during the blackout caused by Hurricane Sandy, it's all we could use for a week as cell service was crappy.  Credit/Debit was useless in many places.  Actually, at that same bar, credit/debit couldn't be used for weeks after because the phone lines were damaged.  So yeah, paper money was all the rage - however people had to walk pretty far to get to the ATM machines that would give it to them.  If the whole eastern seaboard have been brought down, the paper money would go away pretty quick, to say nothing of the security concerns of stores that would then have atypically large amounts of cash.
This is all leading to my point that Bitcoin isn't a replacement system but it's one that can easily be used in addition to our current ones and sometimes is much better.  I mean, on the internet, paper money is useless, no?  And is credit/debit better than Bitcoin?  I don't see how.

The same government that is telling you that Ross is a criminal is also telling you that the agents are corrupt.

@_date: 2014-06-16 15:27:28
Ironically, I got the same dish at the fair.  And purchased a few other items as well, all with Bitcoin.  The sum total was more than I tend to carry around in cash, but that's a personal preference, really.  I get that our habits may be different.
My bank (well, credit union) has branch ATMs but I don't believe any are within 250 miles.  Fortunately because of this they pay back ATM fees.  However I am not naive enough to believe that I am getting anything for free, I am just paying indirectly.  Still, I know where to go in this city for no-fee ATMs.  The only problem with that is I may not know how much to pull out.  Let me illustrate.
Friday night I went down to my local and ran up a modest bar tab - about $20. The guy's computer was down so he was handling all the sale records with little pieces of paper.  While I had exactly $20 on me, that would have left my favorite bartender without his due tip so I had to make an ATM run.  The nearest no-fee one was inaccessible at that late hour, so I had to go to one at a corner market.  Cost me $1.75 (immediately - I only get the fees back later, which is arguably a no-interest loan from me to the bank) but I got enough cash to cover my bartender and, knowing I was going to a craft-sale the next day, pulled out some extra.  I didn't know how much because while I knew I would probably like some things at this sale, I didn't know how many things or how much she was charging for what.
So Sat I make the sale - a one-person craft show who was selling off a lot of costumes, fabrics and accessories that she had acquired and built over the years for all types of parties.  I showed up with about $40 on me and it was better than I expected, so I spent nearly all of that (got some great stuff for me and others!) however there was one piece that really caught my eye.  A matching suit and jacket where the fabric was basically soft slightly-prismatic mirrors.  It was AMAZING however it did not quite fit me, so I couldn't grab it.  Still, if I wanted it, that would have necessitated another trip to the ATM - at least this time the fee-less one near me was available (and hopefully operational.)
Then the next day I went to the Bitcoin fair and bought stuff.  Then met up with some friends elsewhere for more food and drink - now purchased with my credit card, which was fine for me but the merchant paid some percentage in fees - or, again, I ultimately paid those fees added into the price.  And then I went to another place where we did the same while watching Argentina and Bos go at it and I paid with my credit card.  Actually, the first round was bought by one of my friends, who used the cash he had on him - a $100 bill - which while being cash, is kinda tricky since many places refuse to accept $100's due to the threat of counterfeiting.  
I gotta say man, in every situation, Bitcoin had a pretty strong case.  At the bar, even if the places machine was down, I could have paid a backup or previously used wallet.  I wouldn't have had to run out to an ATM and get an ambiguous amount of money in anticipation of the next day's sale.  And at that sale, I could have paid for everything in bitcoin and, had that jacket fit, even the more expensive disco ball suit, instead of running out again to the ATM.  The utility at the Bitcoin Fair is obvious, but after that, I could have used bitcoin at either of the two places I went after and not had to drop a credit card (hopefully nobody handling my card tried anything funny - my number has been hijacked twice in the past year.)  ATM owners and MasterCard definitely made some money off of me during this weekend's transactions and I am not sure why I needed to pay them.
Nobody is going to say that paper, debit and credit are terrible ways to pay for things.  Our commerce system has embraced them so they are as frictionless as possible, given their limits.  But it is undeniable that Bitcoin represents another way that is often as good as or even better than either of those systems in many cases.

I don't think most people really understand that a 32GB smartphone has 1000x the capacity of a 32MB phone.

I think most people basically ride among with what the market offers them, comparing the numbers without really understanding the meaning of them.
But in money transactions, this lack of understanding will not do at all. Someone who confuses "milli" and "micro" may wipe out their savings account when they buy a smartphone from someone on Craigslist in the near future.

Guns are definitely, provably a large part of whatever "metaproblem" it is that you wish to attribute these death levels towards and they are certainly one of the easiest vectors to approach to fix.  In every society that has raised a barrier to ownership, the firearm death rate drops.  You can plot it on a chart - it's simple statistics.  Even dropping licensing requirements has been shown to correspond to a uptick in homicide rates.
Hell, even the Israeli Defense Force was concerned about the suicide rate of their soldiers and so they stopped letting soldiers take their weapon home on weekends. The result?  The suicide rate dropped by 40% on the weekends.  Just the weekends - weekday suicides were unaffected.  The presence of a weapon in someone's home increases the chance that they will die by it themselves (suicide, accident) or that they will have it used on them.

Also, I am not in Bitcoin because I question authority.  I am in Bitcon - way in Bitcoin - because I think it is a fantastic technological tool that has a lot of potential for worldwide empowerment of people.  I am not directly interested in taking down the federal reserve nor do I believe that they - or government itself - is fundamentally evil or even just bad.
But finally, I want to get to the main point of what I don't get - and that is the repeated calls for economic catastrophe that happen again and again from, basically, the austrian camp.  The biggest names I am aware of seem [to call for the end of the world]( more often - missing date after date after date - than any tentpole evangelical preacher I have ever heard of.  I am not saying any system is perfectly stable but I think there are a lot of people who are very invested in keeping the system going as it is and I don't think that if it were truly obvious that something would crash that steps would not be taken.  Take for example the Great Recession - steps were taken to try to reverse it and, while you may not agree with them, they seem to have worked to some degree.  Again, according to many who were very vocal and very certain in those crazy times, we should now be about 4-5 years into a massive depression, caused by hyperinflation.
I guess I just do not see the calls for near-term disaster to be reliable except in terms of their frequency.

The core reason governments exist is because without them, someone would put a gun in your face and take your stuff.  And possibly your SO.  Perhaps even think you have a pretty mouth.  This is just how humans work in a world of limited resources like ours.  
Back in old times, banding together was the obvious solution to this and as numbers grew, setting up specialists to do things that nobody wanted to do full or even part time (standing up on the wall to watch for bandits, walking around within the wall to watch for thieves, etc) and then administrating them accordingly.    And those people who were nearby who refused to pitch in?  Worldwide, they were either killed or forced to serve the folks with the walls (if they had any resources worth taking) or were pushed out to crappy parts of the planet.  
So yeah, you can renounce this government idea all you want but it's proven itself to be a pretty effective concept for millennia.  Good luck going up against it! 


I'm fairly sure you are a citizen of somewhere, however.  And as one, unless your country is sitting on a ton of exploited natural resources, I'd be willing to bet you are obligated to pay some taxes to your particular government and I'll further bet they have guns and knives and jails just the same.  And as a final bet, if you ID it, I'll find some sort of bullshit law/situation that applies there that doesn't apply here or in most places.  Every place has problems and douchebags.

I would much rather these stricter regulations for a company like Mt Gox than have the *even stricter* rules that apply to established banks so that they can use fractional reserve banking.  


Totally agree!  We need more enforcement of existing laws and regulations.  We also probably need more laws and regulations to stop the loopholes and workarounds that very clever financial people come up with to skirt these rules.   I would even like to see much more serious penalties applied to those who break these laws - up to and including actual jail time.   I've felt this way long before I even heard of Bitcoin.
And to keep me from talking out of both sides of my mouth, I also feel that Bitcoin needs at least some regulation to prevent people - either the same con artists or those inspired by greed to emulate them - from running the same games in this space and to face the same punishments for violating them.

[Sorry for the delay - was on travel.]


It's terrible.  But why stop at the decade?  [Let's look back over 40 years!](  And since Gallup started taking polls on this in 1974, Congress has rarely even broached the 40% mark in popularity.  This is because it is a cultural norm for Americans to disapprove of Congress.  
However, look at that key spike.  The one time in modern times when Congress's approval rating passed not only the 50% mark but soared to a high of 82%.  Do you notice when that time was?  Right when they were doing things like establishing the TSA, Homeland Security, the Patriot Act, and other programs.  
That's the reality, man.


[A shockingly low percentage - and it gets worse as you look to younger voters](  Voting doesn't even pass the 50% mark until people hit around 30 or so on Presidential election years - and it's clear that most people barely give a crap about the midterms.  [Hell, the only reasons the modern GOP party hasn't been bowled over into oblivion is because of extensive gerrymandering and low overall voter turnout.](


The Reform Party of the United States?  They ran a crappy campaign - Ross Perot made a huge blunder by quitting in July - but even then they pulled 18.9% of the popular vote.  


Nope - I just showed you the stats - people just generally don't like Congress and people barely turn out to vote to change it.  We don't have massive protests in the streets or civil strife demanding reforms.  We are the way we are because most people don't really care.  With the exception of various hot-button issues - pot, gay marriage, guns, etc - most of the American people don't give enough of a shit to even bother to take their lawfully-allowed time to vote to change things because they are so checked out of the system that they are pretty ambivalent about the outcome.  
Do some people feel "disenfranchised" over the way things are?  Sure - like I pointed out, throughout our lifetimes people have never liked Congress that much.  But it's not enough to make them do anything about it - to lend serious, lasting support to one of the alternative parties out there.  That's just how things are and trying to inflate this circumstance into something else just does not stand up to the truth.


Absolutely.  And if you are not familiar with the extensive work that Matt Taibbi has done in covering the financial crisis - whether you agree with his conclusions or not - then I really feel it would be a waste of my time to discuss this with you further because I have to consider you to be an uninformed person on the subject who is at best just reciting talking points.


The DHS puts your number at about half of that - say 11 million or so - but no matter the number, the vast majority are paying taxes, doing jobs that are essential for many sectors of our economy (go ahead - kick out every migrant worker and watch your food bill soar), most of whom are here to do work and have every self-interest in keeping their head down legally or otherwise because they do NOT want attention from the authorities.  When a simple traffic stop can cascade into your losing your home, job, and life, you have a strong incentive to stay out of trouble.
You should also know that most people who come here illegally don't do so hiking over the desert or tucked in a pickup truck.  Most people just fly in on a visa of some kind or another and just stay.  For example, there are over a million undocumented immigrants here from various Asian nations - and I assure you, they did not walk here.


Fencing them in?  You just pushed for the abandonment of the carrier groups and removal of all bases worldwide.  So who's gonna build those fences?   Also, what do you think we're doing right now by plopping troops all over the region and sticking our noses into various places?  Why do you think we're obsessed with Pakistan?!?!

Are you seriously quoting me stuff from over 1300 years ago?  Dude, it was only 150 years ago that this country used to enslave people - and people fought a war to try to preserve the right to do so.  Women haven't even been able to vote in the US for 100 years yet.   It would be best for you to stop throwing stones about stuff from a millennia previous.


And those girls, their parents, and many of their outraged countrymen were followers of islam as well, so it's clear that islam is not the main cause of the problem here - it's that there are bad guys out there who will do bad things.  That's nothing new.


The Christian religion has already spread itself by the sword (and the gun, and even the pipes, if you believe the St. Patrick's Day legend), got the lands it wanted, and then chilled out.  Never forget that.  Besides, wars are too expensive now - both in money and lives.  We're going to be entering a new phase of warfare now - one where new, hyperdestructive weapons once only imagined in sci-fi are going to be within reach so we can no longer afford to engage in some sort of philosophically-based holy war.  That's the reality of the situation.

That is cool - and I am glad you had a positive experience.   However there are way too many people out there who feel that if there is a way to take advantage of a situation to their favor, then they are justified in doing so, particularly if there is a low chance of repercussions.  So to me this sounds like the payment version of saying that you did some business with someone without a contract and it worked out well.  Great when it does - keeps things simple and lawyers and such out of the mix - but often it does not go so smoothly.
But again, I am glad you had a good experience.  Yay Bitcoin!

None of those activities seem to require any regulatory compliance or bonding.  Want to mine it?  You're clear.  Want to buy it from someone?  You're clear there too.  Promote?  You're golden - Ben doesn't care.  Meetups?  Same.  Convert your meetups into a business like a consultancy or other Bitcoin-related activity?  Generally just fine.
The main thrust of these regulations seem to be if you want to set up a business where the main function is in the trading/converting of Bitcoins.  Basically, if you want to be an exchange or bank, you have to start playing by some of the rules of the same.  That's the gist of what I am getting out of what I have read so far.  But that other stuff?  Complete, wide-open "game on".
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:44:35
Fine, let's use that movie to pick out the slaves under this way of thinking:
Starting from the lowest in the pecking order, sure, the anonymous field workers are slaves - that one is obvious. 
Django himself is certainly a slave - he just benefits from few people really knowing that about him.  Remember that even the limited freedom he enjoys came about through an illegal act (theft/murder) and it requires the presence of his benefactor to constantly endorse.  Without the accompaniment of Dr. Schultz, he likely wouldn't last long as a free man in that world and would be back out in the fields in short order.
Now Broomhilde would also be considered a slave as while she's inside more, she certainly serves at the pleasure of (and historically, often the pleasure for) her master, Calvin Candie.
And as you point out, Stephen is a "well-treated slave" - which is a fine description for his very rare position.  However much of a run of the house he has, he definitely remains in bondage.  Still, recall just some of what I pointed out at length earlier - Stephen cannot free himself at will of his position as a subject of Candie.  He is not even free to travel and in the real world of slavery, his being literate would have been considered a crime for which Candie would have faced punishment.  He also cannot petition any justice system for any mistreatment, to say nothing of even possibly joining it in order to further promote his views and those who support him.  In fact, he has no representation at all and no way to vote for or against those who rule him at any level.  Everyone on the other side of the color line may as well be hereditary monarchs as far as he is concerned - a ruling class that he has been compelled to serve (certainly at low-to-no market rates of compensation) and yet cannot hope to join or separate himself from.  The analogy to today's condition fails in many other ways as well, but I don't want to get mired down here.
But it's not over - based on the original premise, the people who have to obey their societies laws and conventions lest they face consequences are: everyone else.  Don't think so?  Why are Dr. Schultz and Django hunting and killing people in the first place?  Because the law of the people allows them to do so.  All of the people they shoot in the first part of the film are wanted by their society for committing legal offenses - perhaps not as benign as today's not paying taxes or smoking pot but then our penalties are correspondingly lighter as well.  So these people are all deprived of life for their crimes apparently without benefit of trial or at least one where the accused was present. So those men must be considered slaves as well.
Moving up the chain, so it goes for every overseer, townie, sherif, Big Daddy, and even Calvin Candie!  Certainly they have a little more freedom (granted by the money they "earn" by stealing it from the labor of many others) in this world but they too are subject to the laws that confine them - to a lesser degree than the field workers they lord over, sure - but confine them no less.
So by OP's logic, the following people are slaves in Django Unchained: EVERYONE.  And beyond whatever you think of slavery, the fact that someone could not only compare but EQUATE the condition of the dog-eaten field slave in that film to that of Big Daddy shows an incredible inability to distinguish between two very different states of existence on top of an obvious lack of historical knowledge and a lack of basic human sensitivity.

And now that alcohol is legal, there is also violence in the street today.  Sometimes the violence is fueled by alcohol.  However what the author has said is exactly this:  *"By taking drug transactions off the street and putting them online, you eliminate a significant link in the chain of violence between drug suppliers and end users."*  Meaning now that people cannot purchase their drugs via Silk Road 2, they are now more likely to engage in violence to obtain their drugs.  OR that they are more likely to be victimized by their suppliers to obtain their drugs, which does not make any sense in a Free Market because suppliers that used violence against their customers would soon find themselves devoid of customers and out of business.

Ha!  Ok, you got me.  That one slipped past me.


That's true.  Although I don't see this play as being hostile to Bitcoin.  Or at least I think I could imagine some further hostile regulations that would make these seem entirely welcoming.


No state regulator moseying around would discover community that is clearly eager - or even mostly willing - to pay taxes on anything Bitcoin.   And considering the only way those taxes are going to be properly assessed is to track who used what money, I worry that a state in competition for tax revenue will try to grip this even tighter.

Currencies do reuse symbols all the time - but not alone in the same consumer economic environment.  An Australian is not expecting to see "$" prices in an ad circular to be possibly listed in Argentinian dollars, so they assume that the $ means Australian dollars.  If you have to add (AUS) to your notation, you entirely negate the purpose of the symbol.
Bitcoin is expected to be usable worldwide, which would mean that it will appear in every economic environment - and despite optimism, it is not likely to take over a nation's currency anytime soon.  So there will inevitably be conflict and confusion over the use of the Thai Bhat symbol.  No, it won't affect most people in this conversation, but there are a couple orders of magnitude more people on the planet who are well-trained in using that symbol for Bhat than for Bitcoin.
I say either get the double-bar in Unicode right away or go with that new suggestion, but the current common symbol is a bad idea.

I'll try answering number one - the fee goes to the account of the miner who incorporated your transaction into the block that they "solved" and appended to the blockchain, thus confirming your transaction.  Some miners will have thresholds set up to where they will not process transactions below a certain amount, so if a large number of "finicky miners" exist in the system, it may take a long time for a below-threshold transaction to become confirmed.

I'm not sure what the actual lost percentage is, but 30% being mathematically lost would seem like a large number to me. Right now that's ~4 million coins. If we extrapolate that through to the whole run then that final number we should be working with should be 14 million coins, of which 8 million exist today.  But can we do this extrapolation?  Certainly early Bitcoins were discarded and lost in large numbers by casual miners and those who just forgot their passwords. However in the future their value and better/safer management tools will make their owners far more cautions with their Bitcoins.  
Still, enough single/brain wallet folks will remain to rack up some real losses due to hardware/software malfunction, fire, sudden death and so forth, so probably another million or two coins will never really enter play.  So I'm gonna make my guess as ~6 out of the 21 million coins will be lost, leaving ~15 million in general circulation once the mining is complete.
And even though that's ~25%, I think that's pretty significant, no?

I think you have that exactly backwards (edit: or you have it...frontwards - as I am not sure exactly how you have counted the pro/con ratio or who you consider to be the "thieves" here...:) )- thieves are exactly the ones who would feel the most threatened by this policy.  If it was established that Alice stole Bob's coins and an exchange saw that that an account was trying to cash out (formerly) Bob's coins then this might be one initial measure to try to remedy justice.  
OP isn't trying to take his/her Bitcoins home - s/he is trying to get cash for them.  And OP has chosen not to say anything about their previous behavior or other circumstances that might begin to explain why Bitstamp might see his/her trading as warranting extra scrutiny.
One interpretation of Bitstamp's policy is that they are trying to avoid being used as an unwitting fence for stolen coins.

Not just because it's Apple, but because both Google Wallet and Apple Pay are actually good ideas.  Head over to Japan or South Korea and you can see this type of system working very well.  So it's not that the idea is bad.
However in Apple's case, they tend to do a lot of homework, legwork, cash, and push behind their ideas and they have a brand that's strong enough with a lot of people to get them to follow them.  They have a reputation for bringing their customers something new when most of the issues have been worked out so that, basically, their stuff just works pretty well (within Apple-dictated limits.)  
Google is great at experimenting.  They get an idea (or they buy a company that has an idea) and they put it to market fairly quickly.   And maybe it makes it or maybe it doesn't - they tend to let the market decide more.  So sometimes we get good stuff and other times there are some good ideas that die or they just let die.  I don't think Google is as invested in getting Google Wallet going as Apple will be in getting Apple Pay going.

I am not even going to pretend to have suffered any kind of loss comparable to having my wife having to jump out of a skyscraper in order to avoid being burned to death.  Or having my son killed while rushing into a building to save her.  My "losses" don't come close to that.  Maybe yours do, but mine don't.


Technically they haven't been insane.  You might disagree as to their effectiveness, they legality (spirit and/or letter) and so forth - and you might even find that in many cases, I would even agree with you.  But words like "insane" should be reserved for policies that mandate that all citizens must wear a clown nose while driving their car.  Again, there might be disagreement about the effectiveness of these policies - I'll get on that in a second - but they are policies put forth by people who are trying to make sure that people who would like to do nothing more than nuke-glaze NYC and several other cities do not get the opportunity to do so.  You may be ok with several WTC-scale (or larger) events happening with some regularity but I do not think your countrymen are so bold.


The House of Representatives has had 6 elections, the Senate has been completely flushed 3 times, and we've had 3 Presidential elections since 2001.  If the people of this country felt they were suffering due to post-9/11 then they certainly have not reflected at the ballot box.   
What you are forgetting is that after 9/11, people were scared as fuck.  Most didn't know that this type of attack was even possible, let alone that it happened.  I remember reading articles, editorials, and watching interviews with people and they were calling for this and more in the US - setting up the TSA and Homeland Security was not controversial at the time, it was seen as a necessary step and people were glad of it.  Hell, without security assurances, most of the airlines in this country were headed to bankruptcy in short order.  People wanted to see something, the government gave them a something, and the people resumed flying again.


Well, there's something to be said for there having been a substantially-long time since a successful terrorist attack on US soil.  Granted, a few have tried (underwear, shoe bombers, Times Square guy, etc) but in general, those primaries behind the 9/11 attack (and who planned more) are dead or captured.  That would seem to be a reasonable metric of some success.  Not specific enough to say that it is perfect - another attack will come - but one cannot reasonably say all measures have been ineffective.
I should also say that while I might also agree with you that some policies we have taken have inflamed the situation to some degree - even 9/11 was a strike back for our close relationship with Saudi Arabia and Israel - I also know that regardless of US foreign policy, there are individuals and organizations out there that want nothing less than a complete destruction of this nation.  Failure to accept that is simply irresponsible.


Yes, because moving money is generally something that is necessary for terrorists.  Same for money launderers and other folks who are doing shady thing.  On the other hand, it's also what lots of people do.  Again, this is just one place where some measures are put into place and if people were really outraged about these practices, I think they would stand up and go to to the polls to make their counter opinions known.

I was listening to this great episode of This American Life last night. It's a rerun but they reaired it last week. Anyway, you can find it if you want but I'll give you the gist.  
Seems there's this electrician who took a little time to get up to speed on physics and he seems to have discovered something - Einstein was wrong. E does not equal mass times the speed of light squared.  He feels he discovered a fundamental error in physics that has been glossed over by people who have never checked or who have but tow the party line for one reason or another.
So throwing physics books at this guy won't help because he's been at this for years - even quit work over it to do more research and trying to get his message out. Now I want to be clear, this guy is not crazy.  There aren't any aliens involved or anything.  He's just certain he is right in defiance of the conventional wisdom of physics.
Now I was thinking - I could try to explain physics to that guy. I have taken and passed several college level physics courses from 100 to 400.  However it's been awhile and I don't use it from day to day.  So honestly, I would have to struggle through trying to convince a guy who was really up on physics that he had made a mistake.  I would probably be challenged just to find his mistake since it is probably very subtle.  Again, this guy is neither dumb nor crazy. 
What they did on the show, however, was find a physics professor who would be willing to look over this guy's paper.  This was difficult because apparently the "Einstein is wrong!" idea is held by a lot of people and real physicists are bombarded by such requests until they are sick of them.  But they got a professor to look at this guy's paper and right away he found freshman-grade mistakes in the paper. He tried to point them out to the guy but he wouldn't accept them - at one point saying he had to be right because the laws of the universe ought to be simple to understand.
Bringing this back to you, I think you are wrong.  And I base this in large part because a lot of people I know who are experts in this field disagree with you.  Hell, people I don't know disagree with you.  Actually, I can't find many who even try to hold your position at all, let alone reasonably.  Further, based on the tone and conditions that this was released under, this is not regulations to kill Bitcoin.  So basically, again, I feel you are wrong.
Now there's lots of information you could use to find out for sure. You could reach out to the people I listed or other people.  You could look at the statements of various company reps in reaction to the draft regulations.  You could even be right to some degree and make your case to a larger audience than one lone dude on Reddit.  Or you could just fold your arms and insist that you are right because your way has to be the right way.  
It's up to you.

So in this case, I am reading the opinions of the kinds of people who *are* experts in this field to try to understand the practical reach of the proposed regulations and how it should be taken.  That's really all I can do because otherwise, I would find myself leaping to conclusions that may not be supported.  A good example of this is one you raised here:


To which you said:


Right - however I do not believe that the intent of the regulation is to claim that the miner is the 3rd party they are speaking about here.  This is where some of Bitcoin's realities - where every transmission passes through 3rd parties - is different than the understanding or intent of 3rd parties in a regulatory context, which I take to mean a functional, specific intermediary agency like an exchange.
The same could be said about a lot of readings of these regulations as well - a lot of questions need to be asked for clarity and even some objections put forth.  And ideally, we'll get some feedback and modification of this from the office.  That's the way it ought to work and until this does not, I don't see the reason to panic.

Because the Massacre was a singular event where the participants - assailants and victims - were gangsters (we would write them off as "thugs" today) while alcohol-fueled violence, including domestic violence (which can be a lot more dangerous and deadly than getting punched around a little), led to the deaths and injuries of orders of magnitudes of often-innocent people across the country the day before, the day of, the day after, and each day since. While it made for lurid headlines at the time, in terms of overall alcohol deaths, the Massacre was statistically insignificant.

Comparing the statistics of actual malware found "in the wild" in the Google Play system vs those found in the Apple App Store - a score of 275-1, if the F-Secure report is to be believed - suggests that Apple is doing more of a better job of policing the software they offer than Google.

I am honestly not even sure what that means.


If I volunteered for that, then no.  That's me giving everything that I produce to you.  Not sure why I would do that, but if it is my free will decision, then that's what I did.  Sort of like how you say if I come to your house, I gotta take my shoes off at the door.  If I want to come in, I take the shoes off.  If I don't want to take my shoes off, I don't come in.  But what I don't do is come in your house and mouth off about how you are oppressing me over the shoe thing.
Again, assuming you are a US citizen, you had ~18 years of grace time to see and learn how this system works on this plot of land.  If you didn't like it, you should have joined up with another likeminded group who had their own plot of land somewhere or scouted out your own plot of land and perhaps attracted some buddies.  But the people who fought/died/paid/whatever for the land that you grew up on decided long ago that this is how people are going to do things around here.  Is that wrong?  I cannot find any moral reason why a set of free humans can't band together and agree to do anything they want.  You may disagree with it, but that does not mean that it is wrong.
Now someone may come along and say "I don't want to play in this game." to which the rest of us say, cool!  Either work to change the system (to something positive/sensible) or leave the system.  Because contingent on your enjoying all of the benefits and perks of being here was the agreement that you would pitch in to pay for it.
So I do respect the people who have the courage to stand up for their convictions and either leave or face the agreed-upon consequences of their decision.  However I do noit have that same respect for the hypocrites who are just happy to talk a big game while anonymous and all the while quietly leeching off of the system they implicitly agreed to participate within.

Well, since the other devices I use are made by Apple, I would say it would also be difficult to call me a typical Bitcoin user. :)
Still, I think the posters point stands to some extent.  Every desktop I have owned/bought/built for decades - long before Bitcoin or even the popular web existed - has had gaming as a significant or even the primary performance priority.  Across this span, I have helped or closely advised easily dozens of friends and family members, sometimes being 100% in charge of buying the machines for family members or handing down my lesser machines/components to friends who were a little down on their luck.  I have worked for the tech department of a large computer retailer and have given buying advice - good advice, I hope (my pay was not based on sales so I didn't mind saying if we didn't have what I thought was best) - to hundreds of customers.
In that time, I have never advised or assisted someone to get a Linux box.  Aside from some half-hearted experiments, I just don't know much about them and I would not be comfortable advising someone, especially someone close to me who needs my help, to get a system I am not sure about or know I could maintain and repair easily.
I think it is missing alot to totally discount the power of gamers in terms of computer purchasing influence.

"Regulated" is not a binary state of being.  There is "adequate regulation", "excessive regulation", and "inadequate regulation", and many more variants, including "ambiguous regulations".

Here's the thing though - the Wild West is a time from 100+ years ago.  And the first thing those Wild West people did once they could get a handle on the Wild West was to end the wildness of the west.   We've romanticized it as a culture to some extent but it was a pretty brutal time.  People got shot, robbed, and their property taken on a regular basis - and people didn't like that so they called out for more order and laws and regulation until those crazy times were gone.  
Big picture, I think it's a "grass is always greener" idea.  People in very structured, ordered, and regulated societies dream for one with some amount of broad freedoms that would flow after government has been lifted while those in societies with no real government wish they could enjoy the security and stability that a non-chaotic environment could offer.


But Gox wasn't the first exchange scam.  And it wasn't the last exchange scam.

Don't be a douche, bro.


No, I think you are wrong in your interpretations.  I think the things you call absolutely clear and in black and white are not this at all.  And I think you have overreached past everyone when you claim that individuals will require a bit license because miners are clearly the third parties that are addressed by the regulation.


I pointed you to an compliance expert, the CEO of a Bitcoin company, a journalist and others in the field.  Which one was wrong about the outcome of regulations and could you cite where?


Sure.  Jerry Brito has 3 main points (which you felt required 2 links to the same piece).
1) "Licensees would be required to maintain “the identity and physical addresses of the parties involved” in “all transactions involving the payment, receipt, exchange or conversion, purchase, sale, transfer, or transmission of Virtual Currency.”"
So people who are required to have the license appear to have to do something that he feels is fairly unworkable.  He then goes on to cite Coinbase and Bitpay as examples of how this could be difficult.  
2) "The definition of who is engaged in “virtual currency business activity,” and thus subject to the licensing requirement, is quite broad. It has the potential to swallow up online wallet services, like Blockchain, who are merely providing software to their customers rather than administering custodial accounts."
Now he says that the regulations could be interpreted to encompass Blockchain, citing them as an organization that has customers.  So again, we are not in an individual space.
3) "The rules would also require a license of anyone “controlling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency.” While I take this to apply to centralized virtual currencies, some might interpret it to also mean that you must acquire a license before you can deploy a new decentralized altcoin. That should be clarified."
Which covers people/companies who release new Virtual Currencies.
So Jerry Brito has completely missed how these regulations clearly - written in black and white, I believe you said - require all individuals exchanging bitcoins amongst themselves to get a bitlicense.  I guess this means that you are now better at reading the regulations than Jerry Brito is, correct?   
You had the entire Internet before you to present someone clearly agreeing with you and this is what you came back to show - something that doesn't even come close to supporting what you have been going on about?  You are wasting your time defending your erroneous belief and now I am going to stop wasting my time addressing it.  Adios.

Thank you - because these two sentences prove my point precisely.  The American people wanted the TSA and anyone who stood in its way would have been mowed over in any election.


And as I pointed out earlier, we have had several elections since then and the American people have not demanded that either the TSA be changed or abandoned.  So instead of trying to imagine this as some sinister overreach of a top-down run government of tyrants, you might want to look to your fellow citizens as who is responsible for the TSA being formed 13 years ago and its continued existence to this day. 


Honestly?  Eloquent bullshit.  I've met people from totalitarian police states and they laugh at the idea that this is what the US has become - or even close to - in recent years.  To people who have lived in a real police state, our complaints echo that of the petulant teenager who is asked to an unpleasant chore or obey some trivial house rule.


The borders are relatively secure - there's not much going on there to worry about in a realistic sense.  Most visa abusers are regular folks just trying to make a living.  This used to be a "come on in!" country until the folks moving in stopped looking like the ones who came before them.  It's ridiculous, really.  I think if anything, our campaign of bombing muslims is making us less and less popular worldwide - unless one aspires to be a terrorist (or tyranny-fighter), in which case the US is all they think about.   Also, setting the stage for a full-on multi-national holy war is no way to enjoy a long-lasting planet.

Of course we did, there's no point in denying it.

If you didn't like the idea of being a citizen in the US government (with the advantages and disadvantages therein), you could have gone anywhere you wanted.  Granted, the options are probably slim if your selection criteria is "no government" because either this or other governments have done a fair amount of claiming on this planet.  Still, you could probably get away with doing some unsupervised squatting in a few places out there, if not just buying a plot of land outright from a willing government.  
The US government was here before you were, before your father and before your father's father.  So you choose to stay here when you could have left.  You continue to chose to remain here.

Nope, but then again that's not how the government or the tax system works.  Basically we as a population agreed to be down with a government.  And that government is going to make decisions and sometimes they are going to be unpopular - every decision made for a group of people is going to be.  Hell, I didn't like the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan but I didn't reduce my taxes accordingly because that's not in the rules I signed on to roll with here.  So there are some good, bad, and neutral ways to deal with an unpopular decision.  Leeching is, in my opinion, one of the bad ways.
Still gotta say though, if you think the US is somewhere/somehow the high water mark of oppression, I just don't think you are thinking creatively enough, given history.  I can think of a lot of populations - now and in the past - who would trip over their dicks to enjoy our level of "oppression."

Indeed, but as the proponents of Prohibition claimed, alcohol was causing a substantial amount of violence and other damage to society before the ban.  As any decent "Legalize it" pot advocate will tell you, alcohol contributes to more deaths than guns, car accidents, and a bunch of other stuff combined.  So yes, there were some organized criminals and bootleggers committing acts of violence (generally against other organized criminals and bootleggers) while at the same time there were also fewer deadly bar fights, booze-fueled domestic violence murders, and so forth.  
Basically my point is that it is pretty impossible to predict how much violence we now have "in the streets" because of the shutdown of a website and it is hyperbolic to claim that it is now going to ratchet up.  However overall, the ultimate responsibility for the violence falls on the perpetrators, not the State for "refusing" to allow them free access to their drug(s) of choice.

As I pointed out, most people and businesses can easily do every activity they are going to do with Bitcoin.  The rules only impact businesses that operate as exchanges, where they have to conform to similar rules that banks do.  Except, of course, that these exchanges don't get to perform fractional reserve banking, which is a double-edged sword of giving banks more freedom to do more with their assets while also having a ton more regulations with which they need to comply.

I definitely appreciate that sentiment that Bitcoin usage would fail if electricity and internet went away for several weeks or even forever, however speaking as someone who lived in Manhattan during the Hurricane Sandy power outage - where mine and many surrounding neighborhoods lacked power and almost all of cellular phone service for a week, gold doesn't seem that useful.  Those few businesses that stayed open - typically bars lit by candlelight - definitely went cash-only during this time and of course Bitcoin would have been useless.  This is unquestionable.
However there are problems with using gold under those conditions.  Like I said above, only a few of the local businesses bothered to open.  Under these conditions, casual shopping is a low priority.  Also, without lights, many stores were very dark inside, which can be a general security concern.  Also, without any sort of central communication, how does a stable market arise among people who haven't used gold like this ever?  If I am a storeowner who wants to sell a loaf of bread, how much gold is that worth and why?   What if I am shorting myself compared to a guy 3 blocks away?  Over time this would likely settle out but initially, prices would be all over the map - and that's before the "gouging" element kicks in.  And how do my customers take their big gold coins and shave them down to amounts where they can buy my products?  Finally, there are going to be plenty of customers without gold - where are they going to get more gold from?  Nobody is paid in gold and the nearest gold-dishing ATM I am aware of is in Dubai.  It's possible people may trade things for gold but where is this marketplace going to pop up?  And who is gathering all of these things (laptops were kind of useless at the time) - again, the idea of casual shopping was sort of silly, most people were focused on dealing with their lives/jobs/etc.  
So in a short-mid term electricity/Internet absence situation, gold is about as useless as Bitcoin.  Not entirely, of course, it is of course physically possible to use gold, but from a practical POV, gold is not a good substitute for money in those situations.  And as pointed out, in most longer-term system-collapse scenarios, establishing an orderly exchange medium is probably going to be a lower priority.

Do you mean the Republicans who held majorities in the House, Senate, and the Presidency for nearly 8 years after the TSA was established?
Do you mean the TSA that was formed as a part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, a bill sponsored in the House by Don Young (R-Alaska) and signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush in 2001?
Do you mean the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that passed the Senate unanimously? 
And passed the House 410-9?
An act that has gone without serious challenge in the 13 years since?  To put this in contrast, the House has voted 54 times to try to repeal "Obamacare" in just the past 4 years.  How many times have the Republicans voted to repeal the Aviation and Transportation Security Act?  Because just doing so would end the TSA overnight.  
That's the one you mean, right?

I completely agree with you - the regulators needed more power and encouragement to go after these guys.  And when they did, they needed to have laws that had real teeth.  However they did not have these things and the American people did not demand this of them as most were distracted by either trying to blame the government for the mess or in blaming their neighbor (hypothetical or actual) for buying more house than they could afford.  
Really - we're 6 years past near-disaster and who is *really* calling for more/tougher laws to avoid this type of thing again?  Hardly anybody.  Most proposed laws were gutted before passage or have easy workarounds. 


No, but part of the goal of regulation is to provide an environment where the fraud is difficult to pull off in the first place.  Waiting for the crime to happen and then trying to chase someone down who has taken the money and run away is the classic closing of the barn doors after the horses have escaped.  


It also protects adults (and children) from other adults who mean to do them financial harm and reduces their power and ability to do so.


I think we've covered this one but I want to take the opportunity to remind you that basically every pro aspect of Bitcoin - and there are many and I am a fan - makes it a lot easier for people to be defrauded.  And again, while the fraud is a crime, it does not restore anything to punish the criminal.  The Mt Gox money appears to be gone, no matter how many years Karpeles might serve even under extraordinarily strong punishment.

I think you may want to go back to "network" for Bitcoin. In my general experience, non-technical people may think that single computers are "systems" ("I bought a new PS4 system today and got 20% off..." sounds very natural in English.) while "network" certainly invokes the idea of multiple computers - or again, systems - that are distributed yet connected together.

That's not higher up the chain in manufacturer/distribution - that's supplier/end user, which has nothing to do with Mexican cartel violence but everything to do with end users (who drive demand) engaging in or inspiring violence with their counterparts, the suppliers.

Currencies do reuse symbols all the time - but not alone in the same consumer economic environment.  An Australian is not expecting to see "$" prices in an ad circular to be possibly listed in Argentinian dollars, so they assume that the $ means Australian dollars.  If you have to add (AUS) to your notation, you entirely negate the purpose of the symbol.
Bitcoin is expected to be usable worldwide, which would mean that it will appear in every economic environment - and despite optimism, it is not likely to take over a nation's currency anytime soon.  So there will inevitably be conflict and confusion over the use of the Thai Bhat symbol.  No, it won't affect most people in this conversation, but there are a couple orders of magnitude more people on the planet who are well-trained in using that symbol for Bhat than for Bitcoin.
I say either get the double-bar in Unicode right away or go with that new suggestion, but the current common symbol is a bad idea.

We really don't need guns to address the "balance of power" - we need fewer guns in our environment.  There isn't a developed nation in the world where I am in more danger of being killed by a firearm - by a large margin - than here in the US where they are plentiful.  Our extremely low barriers to ownership have made us the most deadly country of our peers, across every cause - suicide, crime, and accident.  This is not surprising - the higher the barrier, the lower the firearm-related deaths pretty much everywhere in the world.
Basically this nation's gun worship gets 30k+ Americans killed each year, several times that wounded, and costs people like me a ton of money in medical costs, crime-related expenses, and other costs and I am tired of paying for it.

I would argue that going with symbol placement is even more confusing and opens the door to significant usability issues and errors in the future.
The $ symbol definitely means more than just USD - it stands for several other currencies, in fact.  However nobody would seriously suggest that we use $ for Bitcoin because it would be very confusing to most of today's Bitcoin users.
Using the symbol for Bhat is confusing and there is no way around it without basically giving a "It works for us - deal with it!" message to those 66+ million people who are most familiar with that symbol.  If we - and the estimated number of bitcoin users are just 500,000 people even now - want to do that, then ok, but let's not pretend that using the symbol is not confusing to many people.

Mt. Gox conducted a large-scale ripoff of many people.  Actually, if you look at the regulations, you can pretty much see how they were constructed to help prevent another Mt Gox scenario from happening here.  Lawsky cannot do much about Mt Gox today but he can - his obligation is to - do something about a company operating in New York that tries to do something similar.  I mean, that's a classic case of "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me!" 


Let's be more realistic - the people who held their money in Mt Gox were speculators, were people who didn't know how to put their money offline, who thought that Mt. Gox was safer than other places, etc.  I know it's cool to consider them stupid - perhaps you feel proud of yourself to be able to do so - but the fact is is that these people make up the people who make up the government.  And those people are very much interested in systems being put into place to prevent them from getting ripped off.  That's the reality of the world we live in and it covers a lot more than financial regulations.

Instead of just writing that off with a correlation!=causation bit, I really did try to find the linkage between Prohibition and the crime rate - especially looking for some sort of consideration of the Great Depression (which destroyed far more jobs than Prohibition did) and all I found was this: *"More crimes were committed because prohibition destroys legal jobs, creates black-market violence, diverts resources from enforcement of other laws, and greatly increases the prices people have to pay for the prohibited goods."*, which surprisingly sits alone without any basis, analysis, or footnotes.

Realistically, population numbers do not matter as much as wealth does in this space.  And not just total wealth, but wealth distribution over a population.  And in this space, US wealth and influence are pretty substantial, reaching far beyond the 5% of the actual population.  Further, the power of US wealth concentration reaches out beyond US borders in influencing policies in other parts of the world where the reciprocal impact is much less.  That's factual.  The goodness/badness/whateverness of that is opinion, but let's not ignore that fact.


It's not sad or silly - it is a useful perspective that shows how despite the "worldness" of the Internet, the dominant country in the space in terms of corporations are US.  8 out of 10 of the most popular websites on earth are run by US-based corporations.  That's something that should not be ignored.

2) As a result, they allowed - no, INSISTED that agencies like Homeland Security, the TSA and other groups be formed.
3) Most of them - the will of the people - are pretty much ok with their continued existence.
Despite your wanting to believe otherwise - that government threw these yokes upon our necks or some other nefarious situation - this is the only logical conclusion that can be drawn, given the very obvious history of the situation.


Actually the private sector crashed the economy, particularly with private banks overleveraging themselves, issuing known-bad-but-rated-good securities, and generally running around unregulated.  Government, if anything, is what bailed out those institutions, kept the economy liquid, and prevented a large scale economic lock-up that would have been disastrous on a global scale unseen in modern times.

Finally, you have the right to elect to leave this country and join up with another whenever you like to free yourself of this state.  
None of those attributes are the hallmarks of slavery in any society - even "well-treated" ones - past or present and therefore the term is being misused.  And this is by any objective measure by someone actually familiar with the concept of historical slavery here in the US or elsewhere.

No, nothing always protects the consumer.  However the examples of how regulation does/has/will protect the consumer are legion.  So to hold up MtGox as the poster child of regulation just isn't fair.  It was poorly regulated because the regulations involved were a force-fit for the exchange and proved inadequate because of that.


We can never know this, I would guess.  However fears over placing excessive regulation is not cause - in my mind, at least - to abandon the whole concept of regulation.


All that "Wall Street" money people are waiting to drop in to either pump the price or give formal legitimacy over Bitcoin?  They are waiting for this.

Perhaps or perhaps not.  But I don't see how punishing Mt Gox further gets people any more of their money back. 
However were it required that Mt Gox have matching funds on hand to cover their depositors, they would have been functionally "bank run proof" assuming all other affairs were in order (like there not being a hack that wipes them out entirely.) Basically that's what these many of these regulations look like - an attempt to prevent a Mt Gox-type exchange meltdown in NY state.
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:30:03


If legal definitions of any kind were black and white, we wouldn't require the extensive court and regulatory system that we currently have today.  :)
While you are insisting that the regulations would apply to ALL miners or anyone using bitcoin, many people disagree, saying that these rules only within the context of the overall "bitlicense" - which only applies to Bitcoin companies whose core business is Bitcoin exchange.  
This is exactly why I don't try to become an armchair lawyer and read these things piecemeal - it's a bit more complicated than that, I feel. 


And from what I can tell, you don't need a license to do these things in Bitcoin either. 
Look at it from my position.  I see [pro-Bitcoin journalists, Bitcoin startup heads, and compliance experts all saying one thing]( and you...um...a random person on Reddit saying something else.  Which one would be more responsible for me to believe?


The only people who didn't know or at least strongly suspect what the NSA was doing were the people who were not paying attention when it started to come out in 2008 or even when the legal authority to even come close to what they are dong was given to them in 2001.  Most people, as evident by their apathy on the subject, don't really care to any large degree. 


And for most of the people in the world, they won't care.  There are plenty of sites and services that operate online that would be in conflict of New York law.  Or California law.  Or even US law.  And yet they roll along.  Of all times for people to look at market-based solutions, this would be it - if these restrictions prove too restrictive for Bitcoin then the market will move to other states.  And if other states all fall in line, then it will move out of the US.  
Do I think that would be bad?  Yes, from what I can tell.  You and I could probably go through 2 rounds of pints talking about how great Bitcoin is.  However if the people don't rally around it in this country and support it responsibly - either now by the early folks or later by more people who see its advantages - then they don't deserve it.


Yes, and part of Lawsky's job is defending investors from people who ran Mt Gox.  Or Neo &amp; Bee.  Or GBL.  Or inputs.io.  And the more money that goes into Bitcoin, the more appealing it will be for scammers to lure people - people who don't have time, money, or resources to take the necessary steps to harden their Bitcoin collections - in, resulting in more people getting scammed, etc.  


Lawsky's rules apply to the whole Bitcoin economy worldwide as much as China's banking rules apply to the whole Bitcoin economy worldwide.

Canadians generally only stay in Canadian dollars.  Same with most people in the world.
Bitcoin is new and global.  Basically places and people who have never dealt with dual currencies will have to do so, perhaps for a very long time because I don't foresee either national currencies or Bitcoin taking over in the 0-5.
This is why a clear and distinct symbol would be better than one that is already established.
Look at it this way - if this were Bitcoin's "zero day", and you had to make a call right now, would it make sense to pick a completely unique one or go with one that is used elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:15:07
That's a fair critique but it is very simple, distinct, and an existing Unicode character, meaning nobody has to do/convert anything in order to adopt it right away.  
Personally, I wouldn't say it's ugly, only unfamiliar - and I think most existing users would grow accustomed to it much like how Facebook users generally complain about how the X version of their interface is terrible and how it should go back to the X-1 version because it was better.

I understand we have a large amount of debt.  However the deficit is currently shrinking both in real numbers and as a percentage of GDP.  So it would seem that things are getting "better" if incrementally.  This means that 1) things could improve in the future and 2) thing were worse before and the nation/economy/dollar did not implode.
Taking it another way, I understand that Greek bonds are now hot.  They used to be considered toxic because a few years ago, Greece was about to completely implode and, with Spain, take down the whole EU/Euro.  That didn't seem to happen.  I'm sure there are many reasons why and some of them may have been economic patches to a leaky hull, but if the hull *can* be patched, it's likely someone *will* patch that hull - or at least try hard to do so.
Anyway, yes, I hope that in 30 years we are all working in Bitcoins.  :)

You get the representation more along the lines of what you want that likely helps reflect your interests. At the same time, if your efforts are successful, you avoid being ruled under representation that runs counter to your interests.


Avoiding using your own political strength and coasting off of that of others is pretty much the same idea as placing your monetary strength in the hands of banks. So long as those who you trust stay on course, you're in great shape. However winds change.


Or the majority may be informed individuals or the minority may be fools, but it matters not as you will be subject to their laws. Do not pretend you have a choice - you will be ruled.

Yes. Same for the legal system and other complex systems. There exists a professional class of people - lawyers - who have to be specially trained to understand it fully and even then they typically specialize in one specific area. In fact, the law is so unclear that we require a large, multi-layered system of judges to decide how the law applies in various cases.


It is entirely not "obvious". 


I don't mean to presume what experience he does or does not have, but yes, he is a financial lawyer who heads the New York Department of Financial Services. As Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency technologies) rise to become a significant financial entity, it stands to reason that some existing regulation would apply to the Bitcoin space as well as new regulations being created to address elements specific to cryptocurrencies. I don't care what one's political leanings are or what one's ideal society is, failure to recognize this *reality* is the pinnacle of naiveté.
Now, no matter what Lawsky does in the future - as former head of the entire New York Department of Financial Services - he is going to have a clear advantage over anyone else wishing to deal with the NYDFS. Believe it or not, I don't think Bitcoin/BitLicense is the biggest thing he's ever had to deal with in his time there. If he went deeper into the banking sector, people over there could say "Did you see how he set up and enforced x-regulation? And now he's in the private sector? Man, Lawsky knows every single person that can get stuff done now...."  


I would like to go further down the calendar. I would like to see not only what the final BitLicense says but I would like to see how the NYDFS carries through with it. Does it impair new companies to a great degree or not in actual practice? Are they hard-asses to everyone? That's really my primary interest here. As a secondary interest, yeah, I would like to see if any entities that work through Lawsky have an easier ride or whatever to a significant degree. 
If those things come to pass, I will totally join you in calling this setup corrupt. Really. But let's see what happens first and then make the judgement accordingly.

For one, I wouldn't want that to happen to him or his wife at all.  For another, if that happened and everyone saw "Satoshi" sell off his coins without notice, that would cause a lot of market turmoil.

The bartender could just use his phone to verify that the transaction happened to the wallet.  Or I could hand him my phone to do the same.  Trivial, really.


I knew hours before that he could take cards.  And it would take about 10 minutes for anyone to charge my phone up from flat to make a transaction.


Consumer protection.
I don't need consumer protection when I am buying $8 curry bowls, $10 sunglasses, $20 bar tabs, or second-hand costume accessories from a private dealer.


Throughout the whole fair, a vendor would key in the amount I owed, hold up a QR code, I would scan it and hit accept.  In every time, in less than 20 seconds, the vendor's phone acknowledged the transaction.  I don't know how much more ease of use it could be as that's basically as long as a Square purchase takes.


That's not the fault of Bitcoin.  I am not going to argue that Bitcoin today is more popular to use than credit/debit.  But I can argue that it is just as easy or easier to use.

Why would we call the winning bid the "real" price?  It is *a* price in a pretty restricted marketplace (you must be this tall to enter.)
Like, if I sold you 1 BTC for a dollar right now, does that mean that other people should consider selling their Bitcoins for less?  Maybe you just happened to get a great bargain.  If I got that bitcoin for free - like the government - then I make money even if I sell it for a dollar.
I don't doubt that these players came at this with multiple strategies and they are very intelligent people, however they could well be playing some very long and very different games that we are not at all clued into.  So the winning number, to me at least, is not indicative of Bitcoin's future - only what the most optimistic bidder with a lot of cash wanted to pay for 30k bitcoins last Monday.

What I did after seeing the ruling (finally) come out was check with various people who I not only believe I can trust, but people who themselves have a very vested interest in the success of Bitcoin.  I don't mean hobbyists, I mean people whose full-time jobs are with Bitcoin organizations at various levels - a lawyer, an expert in the existing requirements environment, and a couple others who made their opinions known publically.  Those are people who I would acknowledge to be better equipped and incentivized to make sure they fully understand what the document says and intents.  So in this narrow area, I feel I have some understanding of the implications of these proposed regulations without actually having read them myself.


And I am pretty sure this is an unintentional misalignment of understanding between terms used by the financial regulatory environment and the fundamental character of Bitcoin.  As you point out, if one takes the approach of reading that says that miners represent the 3rd parties, then yes, this document would effectively ban the entire use of Bitcoin.  However that reading would also mean that huge swaths of additional regulations are also irrelevant because Bitcoin would have effectively been restricted.  However I do not believe that this is the case nor do I believe that this is the goal of Lawsky and his department.  
Instead I think this is a good time for the community to step up and rationally ask for codified clarity about this and other issues where Bitcoin just behaves differently than other financial instruments.  I think a constructive approach is going to go a lot further than some of the knee-jerk, uninformed reactions I have around here.


I don't know why banks who conduct the same business operations that a Bitcoin business does would be exempt from the same regulations.  Still, from what I understand at the banking level, the regulations they work under are often far more extensive and restrictive so it is likely that they will be be able to manage these comparatively lighter regulations with relative ease.


He's not - he's regulating financial institutions that operate in New York State.  Other states have done and do the same thing in their states in various ways.  This is the system that we have had around us for many a decade and as soon as national governments try to take that over, the shouts of "Big Brother" and "Federal power grab!" will accompany the resistance to this idea.

Yeah, I get that distance, cable length and so forth make a world of difference for traders, but those advantages are just modern versions of those that were previous - having (or being) a broker one could call who would relay orders to the floor vs having a constant open line to a trader. Or having to write a telegram or whatever. But I just don't get the theft angle yet.

In my opinion having anonymous transactions is not a particularly compelling feature at this time.  So this tool - and Bitcoin transactions - are not going to pick up a lot of users because of this tool. 
On the other hand, the name is going to come across as a negative to a lot of people who do not want to involve themselves in something that sounds shady, risky, or even possibly illegal.  
So this "Dark" stuff sounds cool to some, will appeal to a few, but will likely put off many more people than it will attract in the long run.  The same tool with less "nefarious" name would be better for the community.

"But for everyday criminals, common targets were often trains and stagecoaches because they were more isolated, easier to get into, and easier to escape. So why bother with a bank, which would be a suicide mission in comparison?"
Not that there wasn't crime, but it was not where people think it was.  But that's not the killer quote:
"In the beginning, there was definitely gun violence, as there was neither standardized law nor a good way to enforce it, but the Wild West didn't stay wild forever.
As towns formed and communities grew, the need for and tolerance of handguns started to fall."
This is what happens.  People didn't *want* to have to worry about getting shot or robbed so they gathered together and made laws to work against this idea.  This. Always. Happens.  As much as some would talk about wanting to have a government that performs minimal functionality in terms of laws and presence in society, when reality strikes, people always have exceptions.  "Well, except for..." and eventually, you get right back where we are today.   
I read this good and fair account of Porcfest - a huge libertarian event held in the northeast.  Lots of interesting things happening up there and certainly some good ideas among them.  But one thing really stuck out - it was an account of a woman who decided that she wanted to dance around topless for a little while.  It was broad daylight and some mothers who were minding their nearby children took offense to this and complained to the organizer who, with a gun on his hip, walked over and told the woman to put her top back on.

Using real-world examples of absolute tyranny as the polar opposite of hypothetical-and-never-existed societies of absolute freedom sounds someone claiming that since we have seen many planets in the observable universe where objects fall "down", there could be planets where things fall "up". Everything does not have an equal and opposite measure.
I mean, we can advance our imaginations to some sort of silver-jumpsuit-era perfect society of freedom but for humans that's as (un)likely as the creation of a world-wide Marxist collective - these are just the future pipe dreams of ideologues who refuse to accept human nature. 
For example, in the US we do not have food and drug regulations because tyranny peeked its head into society, found purchase and attacked mercilessly. We have them because those freedoms were inevitably abused. Recall, at first people were completely free to do whatever and the charlatans stepped up and sold medicines that were useless to the sick or sold bad quality food to those who were hungry. People got sick, injured, and literally died through this and so the population demanded action - they were willing to trade the completely "buy, sell, whatever" food/drug space with one that was more tightly controlled to try to prevent such episodes in the future. Across any conventional metric, this will *always* happen as it is built into who we are.

I live in New York City. You can get handguns and carry permits but generally they are a bit of a challenge. As a result, most people do not have guns. Yet statistics do not show national victims of opportunistic armed criminals - we've had far more shootings and violent crime that many well armed cities (Houston is one of many).
So it isn't the case that raising the barrier to gun ownership leads to more victimization of unarmed citizens. What happens is that it becomes harder for *everyone* to get weapons, including criminals.

Here we agree too - however the incentive to steal is our precious little bitcoins - this existed long the BitLicense or even the collapse of Mt. Gox. The incentive to for people to steal coins exists even outside of any government on earth - it reflects a basic desire that someone has to get more than what one already has for whatever reason: food, shelter, attract mates, pride, or some other rationalization. Regulation no more incentivizes those who wish to steal than fences incentivize those who wish to trespass.

Your point seemed to be highlighted by your writing it in all bold characters here - "what is the point of Bitcoin's decentralized nature if another exchange is holding people's money?" Which could sound like a rant against exchanges in principle. 


"The Exchanges" have no word for us to take. Each company has its own people in charge and the actions of one cannot really reflect on the others. And again, it is not yet time to rush out to "prove" anything as of yet. As I said, Bitstamp's priority should be to secure their assets, to secure their systems, and then to make good on their promise that refunds will be made. If they fail to do that in a timely manner then certainly, let's pursue them further.


What "proof" do you want, exactly? What memo could Bitstamp release right now that would placate you? That they were robbed was obvious. Would you like to know precisely how? What would you then have? How would you benefit? I think what you want would be summed up neatly in what is commonly called an "After Action Report", not a "During Action Report".


Nobody is congratulating them for being robbed and nobody is happy about it happening. However do recognize that they were robbed - that their company and each employee's job is basically on a fragile bubble of existence right now and unless they all did the heist themselves, they definitely have skin in the game as well here.


In an immediate sense, this is supremely true.  What could the police do?  It would take lots of time to get most regular police up to speed on what bitcoins are and how they work.  Maybe a full-on cybercrime division would be more helpful but those resources are rather thin in reality. Financial regulators could swoop in but in general they operate best within frameworks established by regulations - regulations which Bitcoin does not have and which the community frequently fight against. 
So who are you going to call to "fix" this right away - and I mean within hours or a couple days - who could do better than Bitstamp itself?


It would be. So what - exactly - are you saying should be done?

If we see one or more ETFs come into being then there's the gateway to established institutional investing.
With NY's BitLicense - and likely many states copy/pasting them in their own jurisdictions shortly after - many new players and risk-adverse players that have been on the sidelines will be more likely to participate at all levels and businesses that claim that they are regulated and licensed will have solid footing.
An aggressive push by payment processors and systems like Coinbase, Bitpay, and Bitreserve who wish to greatly expand their offerings into more businesses.
Just those cases throws open the doors for the opportunity of an influx of participation by magnitudes more people - people beyond techs who can set up wallets on their personal machines and brave/foolish explorers who have generally been buying small amounts of bitcoin for hodling purposes and occasional purposes.
Still, those things only open the doors - it's not certain how many will immediately (ever?) walk through them.

There is a school of thought that says you won't so much as "sell" all your Bitcoins at various levels, but you may spend a little here and a little there as when (and for) the value to hit those kinds of numbers, it will be much much easier to utilize them.
So when you need a (better?) house - there's some/all of your down payment. Or if your kid doesn't get enough financial aid to go to college. Or if you're in the US and have some crazy medical bill. Scenarios abound but one day you may find that holding out for the wild prospect of 10E6 and 10E7 values is less important than addressing some current need(s).

Nothing we have exists entirely decoupled from the digital space and Bitcoin - as a system - is included in that statement. Regulators are not market makers - they define the bounds of the match and some of the base rules within. From then on, the contest is left to those who can play within the confines.
Perhaps a decent analog would be porn. Without bounds and rules, there would be *much* more kiddie porn floating around. Yeah, the porn itself is digital, but the real-world impact is far beyond that. So we have laws and regulations for the public square producers of porn such that this reduces the amount of kiddie porn. 
However it is undeniable that sometimes the rules can be too strict (see the recent rulings in the UK) but this is not an intrinsic fault of regulations - only demonstrating that yes, they can go too far. However there and in the Bitcoin space, I firmly believe that unless "None." is written on the BitLicense Requirements sheet, there will be some who feel that the regulation is excessive - with perhaps even some objecting to the very idea of some State-run body even having the power to declare anything - or really, nothing - at all.

I would think that Bitstamp's priorities would be to first secure their existing (remaining) funds, then secure their system so that they cannot be attacked this way again, then reopen so that they can, as a business, survive, and then announce any specific details of the attack.


Because they didn't send out a press release detailing how their systems were compromised before they even got back on their feet? Most banks (or other companies) try to hide that they have any security breaches at all.


If people want to actively trade bitcoins in a marketplace where it is easy to do so, are you going to try to stop them? This is what the people obviously want so I don't see why they should have to play by someone else's rules telling them that they are doing their money "wrong".


No, they are the victim. They are, as best we can tell, a company that is been "good" for Bitcoin and has now been the victim of a serious crime of theft. Instead of jumping at them while their house is still on fire, why don't you wait a couple days for them to get things back in order and see what comes out.

When I don't pay taxes or smoke weed in my house, nothing happens.
Oh wait! You mean if I am caught doing those things?  In a society where I agreed to abide by the laws of the land?  Yeah, then I face the resultant consequences because I broke the law.   However at the very least I will be afforded a trial, allowed or even given representation, and have any judgements meted out in accordance to an established code that is somewhat (at least) fair.  And by including the "at least", I mean it is not like I spin a Wheel O Punishment and get either probation or the death penalty for not paying my taxes.
Of course if I would rather not have those laws about pot and taxes in the first place, I also have the opportunity to petition my representative to have those laws changed or removed entirely.  I could get many of my fellow citizens to join me and come up with referendums or other devices for which I can vote along with most other citizens and other methods - including assembling for protests - in order to try to change the laws and the minds of my fellow citizens and representatives who still feel opposite of what I do. 
Or if I find the laws to be too harsh in this part of the country and I would rather leave and try out another part, I can pack my (yes, I have private possessions) gear and roll out without worry that anybody will try to stop or pursue me.  And once I've settled in, if I still don't like the law or altitude or climate or whatever, hell, I can sell all of my things - again, because they are recognized as my possessions - and leave this country entirely for another.  And once outside of this country, I know I still can return without reprisal as well as enjoy some representation of being a citizen of this country even while in another.  But if I still just want to ragequit the US entirely, I am allowed to do so, assuming the citizens of wherever I go will have me.  I do not know where that might be ideal for you, but I am pretty sure they are going to have some laws that you will need to obey or face consequences, just like here.  Although what happens when you break those laws...well, that may vary...

From the article: "Thirdly, bitcoin in a Lightning channel cannot be readily used outside Lightning. While proponents will say that this is not a problem if enough people use Lightning such that you can pay everyone in the network within it, for a large part of the growth phase of the network this will not be the case and there will be a price premium for bitcoins which are *not* encumbered in Lightning channels. This is bad for fungibility of bitcoins as there will be a separate market for Lightning bitcoins vs ones which are *free*."
Bitcoin no longer becomes fungible. There will be two types of bitcoin - those inside and those inside the Lightning network. This dramatically changes the Bitcoin environment.

To answer your question, I have never had a problem getting USD in or out of PayPal or Square. Can you tell me that it will be trivially easy to get Bitcoin into and out of LN? 
Also, can you assure me that all players in Bitcoin will accept both "free" and LN Bitcoin at all times and there will never be a case where a vendor or client gives preference or even outright refuses to accept one or the other?
Even your question proves my point - I remember when people used to brag about how Bitcoin wasn't like PayPal because you didn't *need* a 3rd party to validate, approve of, record, and pay a fee on top of for escorting your transactions. Can you guarantee that there will never be a case where the new channel insurance/payment hubs will leverage their position to inspect, police, or even prevent payments to certain accounts due to any of a list of concerns?
If you can't guarantee any of those, are you trying to trick me into believing that LN doesn't change Bitcoin or were you tricked yourself some time ago?

Earlier this week I placed an order for a Bitcoin-related product made by a popular vendor who has been around for a few years.
I raised an eyebrow as I saw a "Pay with Dash" icon under the basically default "Pay with Bitcoin" setup. Not having any Dash or Dash wallets, I knew I was sticking with Bitcoin.
I sent the payment...and nothing happened. 20 minutes go by, the order is cancelled from the store side on the site. Thinking I did something weird/wrong, I sent it again, double checking that there were good fees attached. Same thing - order times out after 20 min.
I contact the vendor. He says he saw the alerts to his account but no confirmations. We both figure it's a network congestion thing and this guy who sells Bitcoin stuff says, "I suggest using Dash now for crypto payments."
That ought to tell you where we are today. Vendors are accepting and advising using other ways to transfer value because Bitcoin is not seen as being reliable enough for them to use. On my end, I loved using Bitcoin and I hope to use whatever system allows me to do what Bitcoin used to let me do in terms of inexpensive ways to transfer value. But I don't have a Bitcoin tattoo on my ass - if Shitcoin 5.0 facilitates my purpose, I will use that.
Epilogue: Hours later, both of the transactions went through. The vendor saw this and was good enough to send one of the amounts back. In informing me of this, the vendor also complained about the fees involved in making such a transfer, saying "PayPal is more fair."
The vendor closed with, "This is like when you realize that the dream is over."
Get it together, people. Soon. Or users at both ends are going to leave you hodling useless speculative digital tokens.

No - Kiddie porn is photographing or videotaping children performing sex acts. It is *not* intrinsically illegal. It took governments - several of them, actually - to make it a criminal activity. Some kinda drag their ass on that, in fact, so its illegality is not a universal constant. However there is a strong market desire for it - especially apparent given the consequences for having and producing it - and even if the kids were "consenting" (even if of the age of consent in their area, which in many states is under 18 or using emancipated minors) and fairly compensated for it, that would not change the fact that our general society has decided that this should not be sanctioned.


Let's be clear - we don't have a final edition to work with here. And there are plenty of people who see ways to turn what we have seen in the 2 previous drafts [into something fairly positive.]( Also, we should agree that the entire financial sector is layered deep with various regulations, licensing requirements, and so forth - a world that few if any of us (or at least not me) had any real knowledge or interest in prior to Bitcoin. Basically, this is how "the game" is played at this level and how it has been played for some time.
Returning to my original point - that Lawsky set up some (yet not-final) regulations regarding Bitcoin and then plans to quit and start a consulting business is not prima facie evidence that he is corrupt or that the BitLicense is somehow intrinsically invalid/wrong. All that can be said right now is that he's a regulator who, being very familiar with the space, sees an opportunity (which should be taken as a positive) in the future of cryptocurrency to where he's willing to hop on. I mean, I'm ready to open-carry my pitchfork and a torch but I want to first make sure I have the full story before drawing them forth.

Welcome to how our whole system works - finance, defense, agriculture, hell, even Congress. And welcome to how it works in the private sector with agents, vendors, clients, etc - when you have useful information/contacts and can make better use of them via another means/company/etc, you do so.
The important question is, does the BitLicense create a greater hurdle than would otherwise be expected by a financial supervisory arm of government? If it is then ok, we can talk corruption. But if not - if it is about what one might expect (and anyone who did not expect government to weigh in on this with restrictions clearly does not understand government and/or is incredibly naive) then I cannot call this corruption.

You can start the process of renouncing your US citizenship today if you like.
If you want to stick around and change the mindset of the country, cool. But you’re agreeing to stay here and try to do that. And when you agree to stay here, you gotta keep paying taxes. The only question really is, are you going to agree to do that or are you rolling out?
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:11:20
Then you probably should not be taking advantage of being an American citizen. Doing so without paying your share is theft.
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:58:30
If you were to roll out of where you are and try to strut into some other country establish some tax-free haven on land that had already been bought/fought for, improved on, or otherwise claimed by other people, that would be theft.
Now he’s the mind blower...

Sure looks like you are. You know exactly what it would take to end your tax obligation to the US yet you refuse to do it. You’re making a conscious choice each year. Own it.
If you were given a magical waiver that said you in particular were exempt from all taxes and you could continue to live/work in the US and enjoy all the goods and services and benefits of being a US citizen, it would be justly observed that you were stealing. You would be materially benefitting without paying. You would be a thief.

Absolutely! And I hope you take that right seriously. It’s not likely you and I will totally agree on how those tax dollars are spent and such, but that’s just because we have different opinions, priorities, and values. In a country of just us two, we might have to haggle and horse trade to come up with a deal of taxes and expenditures that represent a compromise we both find acceptable.
But then suppose I turn around and blast you on Twitter, saying that the compromise we worked out is bullshit and you’re stealing my money? Doesn’t that sound goofy? 
Now granted, we’ve got 330m people, each with their own ideas and stuff. So folks are gonna get butthurt. Remember - some people make money off those endless wars. Others don’t give a damn about future generations - they want to get paid now.

Determining what “you use” in a society like ours is not calculable. 
The majority of citizens here elected officials who created the current tax system. Everyone involved at every level got a vote. 
If the majority of the citizens do not want the current tax system, it is on them to change or remove it. This is what the citizens have agreed can happen. 
You are on the losing side of what the majority of the citizens want. Doesn’t mean that whatever the winning side does is theft, tyranny, oppression, whatever dramatic works you want to drop. 
The only certainty is that if you find this unpalatable then you are totally free to leave.
Otherwise, own your choice.

Taxation isn’t legalized theft - it’s a consensual collective citizen’s agreement. 
You don’t have to live on this land where this agreement is in force. You have the option to try to go to another land and make it as tax free as you like.
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:39:35
You absolutely did. You got 18 years of having money and resources dumped on you. It was made super clear what the rules and laws of this land are about. If you didn’t like it, you did not need to stay here. 
You got a extended free trial, you clicked on the EULA which clearly stated there would be an annual cost and now you’re trying to bitch about actually having to pay it! 


The hell there isn’t! Oh, it’s not going to be easy for you to pull it off, but it can be done. It’s been done for hundreds of years. Either buy a place from someone else or take it by force from someone else! Be warned - you will probably need to get a few people to help gather up funds for the first case because asking people to give up land is expensive as the amount on the planet is fairly fixed. Also taking it by force could be dangerous. Lots of places have taxes so they can hire and equip people to defend it from people like you. 
Protip: Once you get that new place, you may want to start a system of taxation in order that you can hold it from the next gang of people who might try to take it from you. Just saying - it seems to work better if you do. 
Yeah, this would have been a lot easier had you started this a few hundred years ago. However would you argue that Bitcoin is unfair because all the cheap coins were being tossed around in 2009-2012?

You absolutely consented to this system when, knowing the rules of this land, you stuck around.
I guess if you were smart, you should have bolted for the door at that sweet spot when you maxed out on benefits from the rest of us but before you started contributing.
And each year, you consent with your feet by staying.
Own it.
@_date: 2019-11-13 23:00:12
History. 
A long time ago, some people claimed this land (often in shitty ways). They decided that they were going to set up both taxation and a means by which the citizenry ought to be able to weigh in on how the money is acquired and allocated.
You know this because you were given, at a far greater cost than likely your parents paid, an opportunity for an education that taught you this in schools. You also might have received food and shelter if you needed it while growing up. There’s actually a lot of things that you received and/or could have benefitted from that were almost entirely funded by other people. Because that’s what the people of this land agreed to do.
And really, you could have left at *any* time while growing up and not been billed or paid a single dime back. Talk about a theft opportunity! But no, you decided to stick around and hang out. It’s not so bad here, right? But *you* made that decision and part of that decision meant you had to start contributing to that pot. You want to stop? Ok - cool. Pay this year’s tab and head on out. Literally nobody will stop you. 
But don’t try to call it theft. You agreed to it then. You agree to it now. And you will likely agree to it tomorrow. The only person you can get mad at is you.

Voting isn’t broken. Under what system do you think everyone is going to look at the outcome - say on abortion or something - and say, “Ok - we’ve achieved our goals!”
No, the real people behind the idea of “everything is broken” are people who want you to give up so they can run things to a degree that’s disproportionate to their numbers. 
Imagine we’re in a country of 100 voting people total. The people who want X - in their hear and soul - number 25. They would get outvoted every single time under a “fair” system, no?
But suppose that 25 convince some of the other 75 that the system is broken. They should not even bother participating! It’s useless! They don’t need to convert all of the rest - some of them are lazy or don’t care or whatever. So 20 aren’t voting anyway. But anyway, the 25’s messaging works so well that another 25 of that 75 just throw up their hands.
Now to that first 25, their only real opponents are that 25 on the other side. Elections become a tug of war between nearly-equal numbers in the voting booth. But **really**, upwards of 50, 60, or even the whole other 75 people are not on the same page as that first 25. They just don’t all show up to the polls to vote. 
As a result, that first 25, when they win, get to pass (or remove) all kinds of laws and regulations and declare/end wars and do all kinds of shit that most of the 75 are not really interested in having happen. But they are still bound by the laws. They still pay for the wars. And so it goes forward.
So it’s not voting that’s broken. The problem is that too many voters are broken. They think not participating in the process will somehow lead to a better system but that’s not how this works at all. The 25 are just going to keep doing their thing and everyone else is going to have to live with it unless/until they assert themselves in polls, nominate candidates they like, keep tabs on the people the elect and hold them accountable for what they do while in office. 
Government works. Lots of governments work awesomely! But it’s critical that the people underneath the government also participate and cultivate that government.

1) Refuse to do it, renounce your citizenship, and go to a place where you don’t have to pay taxes. It probably won’t be a very nice place but that may be because the people don’t pay (or the government does not collect) taxes. Or establish your own place - instructions given previously.

In a way it’s like saying, “Cops suck!” - which is ok to say but consider what places were like before civilian law enforcement existed. The people in lots of places definitely did and that’s why cops exist today. So instead of tossing out the cops concept, I say we refine it so it works for us (or, to my point about value differences, most of us.)

When my neighborhood started recycling, we got issued an an extra bin.
The extra bin definitely took some load off the trash bin but by no means replaced it.
If I threw a one-off party, I might fill both bins and even have some extra trash that didn't fit, but I wouldn't mind keeping the overflow bagged up out on the porch until pickup day when things would go back to normal.
But if I had people over all the time - like took on boarders so my house was chucking out like, 2, 5, or 10x more stuff - then that little recycling bin wouldn't do much good. The real solution would be to either get more bins or even subscribe to a dumpster service.

You’re making it worse. The value of stocks comes from existing assets and the potential of future earnings. Bitcoin has no assets to buy into and it doesn’t produce anything. This means that if this is all there is, the future value of Bitcoin is going to entirely depend on an ever widening circle of people buying into it to maintain its value - that is, until there are no longer any interested buyers.
I’d rather we not find Bitcoin in this circumstance.

Because Bitcoin is open source and ruled by consensus, no dev can undermine anything about it. They can only present options in the form of code. The Bitcoin that exists will be the one that the majority of people directly involved with Bitcoin choose to utilize. 
This is what the free market looks like.
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:14:44


I emphatically disagree. You may not like the actions of those two devs but if their idea does not have popular support, it will simply die. Maybe the devs will continue to support Core, maybe not. Either way, we will know what they are doing as contributions and commits are signed by their authors as should be done.
But the censorship accusations stand and, in my opinion, appear to be basically uncontested. This means that this sub cannot be counted on for reliable information about significant issues in the bitcoin space. The parameters that can trigger deletes and bans under these conditions are unknown and up to the mod(s). There is no functional appeal. Nobody signs off on them. It just happens and people go away. I believe the loss of faith in this community and other online sites - or even just the perception of this - is far more damaging to Bitcoin overall because this taint will not go away for any future that I can see. The other subs and message boards will grow and thrive but they too may have their own issues based on being formed in a schism. As a result, it is unlikely that there will ever be another (somewhat) cohesive "one-stop shop" for reliable Bitcoin information on Reddit or elsewhere - just a bunch of minor kingdoms, each with their own ruler (or despot, depending on one's POV.)


I didn't see any implementations. I've seen a fair number of board postings and I've seen some theory-based white papers, but I have not seen any implementations.


By taking the issue to the people running the network? That's the most responsible thing I have seen happen out of all of this. Bitcoin did not need another 6 months of back and forth on various forums, subs, and Twitter trying to resolve intractable positions. Just put it to a vote - if XT fails then fine, let it fail. Try something new. To quote Tuco from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, "If you're going to shoot, shoot. Don't talk." It was time to shoot and they did - now let's see what happens and then move on with the result.

Good piece.
I remember when the WWW started getting headway and while using the then-hand-curated Yahoo was cool, this new “web crawler” tech gave us an idea of just how many web pages there were out there. I don’t remember the exact number that inspired the following comment, but I remember seeing a number and asking my work buddy from the other side of my cubicle, “Do you think there will ever be a *million* web pages?” and we talked about it for awhile.
At that time, we just didn’t have the mindset to really appreciate all of the tools and utilities that the web would bring. We could basically only imagine “more like this’ - little one-off pages here and there, some funny stuff, etc. - and then extrapolate from there as a basis to estimate the utility of the network. Yes, some people were screaming, “E-commerce!!!’, but there were a lot of tech hurdles to be overcome. Even when it started taking off, very few people were putting their *credit card numbers* on a *websites* for many years after the online stores came online. 
I don’t say this to claim that bitcoin (or something like it) *will* hit moon, Mars, Oort Cloud, whatever. Only that the future is very hard to predict accurately when all you really have to base your assumptions off of is a mindset that is largely set by your present.

I think you are asking about a collision and the odds of that [are rather remote.](
"The total number of bitcoins that will ever be mined is 21 million. The smallest bitcoin unit is a satoshi (0.00000001 BTC). If we place all possible satoshis into a wallet of their own, we would get the maximum number of wallets that could have any balance to them (so the actual number of wallets with bitcoins is obviously less). This is 21x10^6(BTC) x 10^8 (satoshi/BTC) = 21 x10^14 wallets. It's a huge number, but it's eclipsed by 2^256 possible wallets. So in this worst case scenario, the probability of guessing a wallet with one satoshi is 21x10^14 / ( 2^256 ) =1.813595x10^-62 . An incredibly small number."

Not running XT could be seen as a clear act of protest against the idea of large blocks though.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:09:13


I don't think either side has a technical expertise monopoly or even a clear majority in this case, so this cannot be made as an argument. Even the core developers were split on what to do so it is not like there is a clear and certain path that must be followed. Even the very idea of block size limits were brought on in the first place as a late add-on to Bitcoin, so not even the architect thought that they must be in place. 


This is odd because I was always under the impression that Bitcoin functional is what the majority of miners and node operators define it to be. That is one of the checks against the core developers is that they could release pretty much anything - change the blocksize, skewing the reward schedule, fiddle with the difficulty, etc - but if those actually running the software decided not to adopt it, then it would not matter because such an update - hard fork, soft fork, or simple update - would die on the vine. 
Also, there does not appear to be any other way to determine true consensus among Bitcoin users than this. 


Claiming that all of the best engineers and researchers would be shut out seems a little far fetched. If we were having this conversation 6 months ago, I think Gavin and Mike would be named in any complete list of top-level bitcoin engineers and researchers. And certainly they have received their share of bullying and accusations - for months, not just a week - up to and including Mike being a puppet for the CIA.
And far from being forced out, I believe - or would like to believe as honestly, we will just have to see - that those engineers and researchers who have expertise on either side would be welcome to still audit the code and make proposals for improvement to the codebase of the victor. In fact, I think it would prove the network to be more healthy if, when one side prevails, that the "losing side" does not go stomping their feet to quit Bitcoin forever. I would be disappointed in anyone at the top of either the Core or XT side who did that, to say nothing of the many developers who contribute at various levels to Bitcoin. 


I see this more as necessary birthing pains. For as much optimistic tales as we tell ourselves about what Bitcoin can be, the actual code we have right now cannot serve that purpose. Changes *must* be made and if a consensus among the high ranks cannot be reached then I am open to considering opening the floor to the operators to choose their own destiny. However one thing I have observed about nearly anything in Bitcoin is that no matter what happens - or does not happen - someone is not going to be happy about it.
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:08:03
I think I am aware of the compatibilities (or lack thereof), however this only happens once a supermajority of nodes have chosen XT and a &gt;1mb block is generated (which as I have said before will probably be done by someone immediately just to drive a nail into Core.). But in any case, the block size issue (or at least the perception that the block size issue is a serious issue) needs to be addressed and basically this referendum seems to be the only way to actually do it. The various sides in the debate spilled billions of electrons in pushing their respective ideas with no real progress, generating uncertainty and even ill will among many in the community. Reputations of individuals on all sides and community confidence in this subgroup have suffered to a great extent and regardless of outcome, may remain tarnished for some time.
But a vote has been called for the network - not the twitteratti or those with tons of Reddit time or other "elites" in our space - to decide what it wants. We each can vote too - buy a dedicated device and/or run node software on an existing machine. (I mean, there are less than 7000 nodes total so talk about having a relatively powerful voice!) In any case, if a supermajority of the network wants to run XT with its larger blocks, then so be it. Or if enough of the network decides that it wants to stay with Core, then so be it. What I hope happens is that there is a definitive path chosen by the network and then we just move on because playing out this hyperdrama day after day does little to propagate confidence in Bitcoin on the whole.

If it pleases the Court...
People often say “Bitcoin is not backed by anything!” and that’s a little ambiguous because some people think “backed by” means like with a precious metal while I think what they really mean is, “controlled or regulated by”.
No one person or designated group controls Bitcoin. There’s nobody to hire or fire or elect or impeach. It’s basically subject to market forces and in accordance with the real world, the resources people can bring to bear are disproportionately distributed. Basically what Bitcoin is and does is generally subject to the whims of the commons with extra weight given to those who have more resources to do so. 
Everything positive about Bitcoin can be changed. As an example, we were on the cusp of losing real fungibility next week. It’s not clear if we are going to depart from absolutely irreversible transactions. So why isn’t anything else up for grabs? 21 million bitcoins? Why not 21 billion? If enough people wanted it, that could happen in a month. Just hope that you are on the side of people who wanted whatever they pushed for.
So Bitcoin is a huge financial and behavioral experiment where anything could change and no one person or group can be held accountable. That can be scary.

Nobody is forced to look at any idea. People who want to run Core for any of a half-dozen reasons should just run Core. People who want to run XT for another half-dozen reasons should run XT. If anything, having just 5 people determine what they people will or will not get a chance to run is an obvious sign of centralization.


They are not different entities. Until the first &gt;1mb block is mined, they use the same blockchain all the way back to the Genesis block, the same nodes verify doublespends, the same miners process transactions, and so forth.  In fact, 5 months, there may *only* be XT, with Core rapidly diminished to nil. But what there won't be in 5 months is a restoration of faith in this sub. 


Hold on now. You said "I saw proposals being openly proposed and discussed and implemented," and I wrote my response saying that I had not seen a solution being implemented. Lightning? Still just a paper. Some people fell that letting the network hit a wall and delaying payments just ought to happen. Some people consider that to be ideal, actually, as it will boost transaction fees among other things. Yet this position is anathema to others who believe a system should always offer capacity to its users. There is a split among the core devs on this so they decided to basically hold a vote by those who are invested in Bitcoin's network already.
And if we do not do this, how will "we as a community" agree on anything? Will we determine what the community wants by karma points? By number of posts? Use of all caps? Dropping sick burns on Twitter? Lengthy blog posts? By banning dissenters from this group, moving posits in other groups, and so forth until there appear to be no more voices in opposition? Tell me - honestly - how do you see community consensus being measured when we have no other way to do so? How do you see community consensus being achieved when many people feel - or actually are - shut out of the conversation? 




When I came into Bitcoin some time ago (not trying to get into a dicksize measurement - just saying I've been here awhile) one of the guarantors of security was considered to be that of network consensus. That if sufficient assets on the network said "X is true." be it transfer amounts or whatever, then for the purposes of the network, X was indeed true. Because this is critical, the ability for everyone to participate in the network was considered important to making this secure and facilitating expansion (remember: "Don't buy bitcoins - mine them yourself!"?). 
We are at an impasse. The Core developers are split - seemingly intractably so. As a result, one side has put forth the alternative option into reality. If the network adopts this option, this is what Bitcoin is. If the network rejects it, then this is not what Bitcoin is. I am actually surprised to see what is a perfect example of a "free market solution" being so soundly rejected. Again, there are less than 7000 nodes. If you want to vote, set up a node and run Core. But ultimately Bitcoin will be whatever the network consensus says it is. We both know this to be true.

I think the last few months of online battling between devs, scientists, engineers, business leaders, and so forth has done the majority of the damage here. Accusations of subjective censorship and splinter subreddits forming as a result of the XT release only have made matters worse.
I am not as concerned about these price drops. My generally positive outlook on Bitcoin (or something like it) is based on looking years down the road.  The technology is still valid and the potential is orders of magnitudes away from being realized. Short term minor price fluctuations are irrelevant to me as I have been in this space for well over 2 years now so a 20% shift barely gets my attention. :) If anything you should welcome this drop as a buying opportunity as after January (if not sooner if Core bends to BIP 101), this will likely be a non-issue.

Ah - you don’t design websites or appreciate what goes into usability. Well first, those that do thank you because what they try to do is make this effort invisible to you. But what you should try to understand is that tacking on more clicks, adding to the process of sales, this reduces conversion rates. It makes it less appealing. Take any task you do now and add 3 clicks to it and see if you don’t think it sucks by comparison. 


The user wants a $1.99 product. You are telling them to spend $52, $53, or more in Bitcoin to receive $50 worth of credit to spend. This is effectively a “Pay for 26.5 games, get 25 games!” coupon which does not make much sense. Further, it presumes that the buyer just happens to have $50 ready to spend in the first place. It also gives Valve that 25x float. You see, if the buyer buys one $1.99 game each week, it will take them several months to eat through that $50 credit. If they believe bitcoin is going to substantively increase in value, why would they let Valve realize the gains over that period instead of themselves enjoying the benefits by converting each week at more favorable exchange rates? Why would anyone?


Hahaha - you contracted Bitcoin Cash to look like “bitch”. You are very funny.
Since you’re big on telling people what is easy and how to spend more money to get less product, could you tell me what Bitcoin is supposed to be for if not for making purchases? Yacht buys? G6 rentals? Was this really all created so large account holders at institutional banks can swap 8-digit sums better? Because my extensive reading of early documents and involvement in Bitcoin suggests otherwise.


Cons of the lightning network -
Unlimited txns scales txns, not users; only works for payments

I think just the existence of the XT option is a huge step forward in terms of progress. Now instead of debating the issue, people can just vote with their software and the issue can be settled that way instead of endless go-rounds on Twitter, forums, here, and whatever.
From my vantage point, the new vitriol and rage concerns the perception of censorship that is happening here and, ironically, the widespread belief that the moderation of several online avenues of Bitcoin discussion has become too centralized. 
XT has just hit 12.5% (1/8th) adoption among the node network in less than 10 days. It is clear that support for this approach is there and substantial. If it continues to pass 50% and ultimately to 75% levels then at some point a new communication strategy is going to have to take place here and elsewhere.

I've never understood why people think American soldiers have some special breed of sympathy for those who would be in rebellion. Like across the world and throughout history, countries have not been able to turn their soldiers on their own people. It's all in the messaging, man.

If just a trillion over decades then I think Bitcoin will have failed.
It's like the WWW - few people *needed* the WWW at first. There wasn't much to do on it. There was no ecommerce. Just to get on was complicated and expensive, requiring that $2k computer buy-in and stuff. Connection speeds were generally so slow that the experience was generally lousy.
In less than 8 years, the world went from "What's the WWW?" to "The WWW is awesome!" with billions flowing in all across the sector, entire departments created in Fortune 500 companies just to create and manage their presence on the WWW, lots of VC money flying around. Even after the crash, there was still a comparative ton of money in the sector. In the next decade, Google, Facebook, etc, all built on the WWW became multi-billion dollar companies. 
The companies, the projects, the applications, the people, and more that will be important household names because of their various roles in Bitcoin likely have not even been heard of yet.

I thought one of the main points of this was to use the coins to represent ownership. The value would then follow in say, fiat currency. It would basically become just like the stock market - each smallest-denomination of IBMCoin would have a value because it represented 1 share of IBM stock.


I don't think they would be as worried about mining profitability. If X wants to trade some shares of IBMCoin to Y, neither party wants to have to dust some IBMCoin in order to do it on the network. They'd just want zero-fee (internally) transactions to just happen - with any actual (and small) trading fees getting tacked on to anyone who wanted to participate in the system.
Turned around and look at where they are in Bitcoin. They have no idea what transaction fees are going to be even 1 year out. Maybe the miners win in this schism and blocks are small, so people have to tack on more and more fees in order to make a trade. Or maybe the blocks get big and nodes drop off. Or maybe there are 2 bitcoin ecosystems running around for awhile. It's an awful lot of uncertainty that NASDAQ has pretty much no control over, which seems very a-characteristic of them.

Then when the fees were approaching a quarter or so, other people said that bitcoin was not meant for small ticket items like music tracks and whatnot.

The blockchain allows for those 8-10 participants to basically maintain a central ledger with a very clear and traceable line leading to each change made, who made it, who confirmed it, and so forth. So yes, it's a decentralized database system. Company X doesn't control it in their datacenter and neither does Company Y - they all participate in using it. They just don't have to worry about the core devs having squabbles, miners who want higher fees, the decline of nodes, and the occasional approaching 51% pool.
Going full doomsayer here, let NASDAQ use bitcoin and then a massive series of mining farms suddenly are flipped on (or an existing set pool together) because there are now incentives for unknown actors to try to corrupt or affect share data and it's a whole different world for the participants in the system.

More recently thousands of US troops were deployed against various labor movement protests and shot/killed the protesters. Most recently, Kent State stands out as an example.
As best I can tell, there's nothing remarkable about the American soldier that is going to cause them to disobey orders - like across the world and across history? I mean, the orders are not going to be "shoot that baby" - they are going to be "shoot that terrorist who is shooting at you." Because let's be real, some of the most vocal supporters of armed revolution in the US are not exactly able to be described as "good guys".
My question is more, What kind of situation are people imagining that is going to motivate American citizens to start taking their guns to the streets to fight? I mean, we can barely get peaceful protests going in this country and people are going to drop their jobs, their livelihoods, risk their homes and families, and their very lives to fight? Even during the Revolutionary War, it is said that only about 3% of the population participated in the fighting in any way - and that cause was pretty clear. My thought is that by the time you get real numbers of people willing to do this, the nation has already functionally imploded.

Unfortunately for that idea, the people we were fighting in Iraq were not ordinary citizens - the "good fighters" were generally former Ba'athist military and secret police - people who had extensive training and established communication networks. The lower-level people - people who came to join the fighting and whatnot - were sometimes used by these people as suicide bombers because they could be convinced by twisting their faith to do so (know any Americans who would sign up to be a suicide bomber?). The weapons they were using were automatic rifles not the shotguns, pistols, and hunting rifles most armed Americans have. We're talking military grade weapons, artillery shells for IEDs, some mortars, and RPGs - weapons that American civilians simply do not have or even know how to use effectively. Further, the people fighting in Iraq were being supported - financially, with hardware, and intelligence - by regional players like Iran. 
But the most unfortunate part is that even with those odds - and the US military playing an "Away Game" in terms of being unfamiliar with the language, the culture, the various factions, and so forth, the Iraqi resistance was getting smoked in Iraq - on the regular. [Have you ever actually looked at the battles of Iraq?]( Look at the outcome of battles - the kill ratios were generally 10:1 against the Iraqis at best (for them). And in every battle, they lost. They got beaten hard every time. 
Or let's go to Afghanistan. There we have a people who have been in pretty much perpetual war for generations now. They know warfighting. They are fighting in brutal, inhospitable turf that their enemy - the US - knows little about. They are used to living in harsh conditions, running lean, fighting, and fading away. They are also sponsored by regional powers and draw to their ranks people from all over the world who wish to fight and kill Americans. And again, check the stats here - 
Just clicked a random battle that I haven't clicked before - here's the ["Shah Wali Kot Offensive"]( Coalition forces - 2 wounded. Opposition forces - ~100 killed. That's the kind of meat grinder that experienced fighters, using more advanced weapons, and fighting an enemy that stands on foreign turf in a strange land - that's what they are facing when they go up against modern military forces. Remember, in over 20 years of fighting (Iraq and Afghanistan together), not even one remote firebase has been overrun by rebels of either country. 
Also remember that this means the US Military has 20+ years of experience in fighting urban (Iraqi) and rural (Afghanistan) rebels. That's a generation of well-studied lessons about how to fight people with even better arms and support than just simple civilians with recreational weapons who have basically zero experience in warfighting. And you want to tell me that Americans with just pistols, hunting rifles, and shotguns are going to do better? Why? Because 'Murica?

I'll try to explain, but I feel you have pretty much written me off, so this last go of it may be a waste of time for both of us.
Please read what Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Bob Greifeld said, "The application of blockchain technology within Nasdaq’s private market aims to modernize, streamline and really secure cumbersome administrative functions." He doesn't say anything about their having trust issues. He's looking to streamline their existing system. Bitcoin has shown some fantastic ways to do this.
So I don't see the purpose of this blockchain as being foremost about establishing indisputable trust. NASDAQ does not have a trust problem. NASDAQ has a friction problem. They (and their industry) have engaged in trading on company-trusting systems for decades now. They are good on that level. 
But of course nobody wants a system that cannot be trusted. This is why the security does come from an expensive hashing algorithm - it's just not infinitely expensive and it is easily monitorable. According to Blockchain.info, the current BTC hashrate is 370,696,911.33 GH/s. If you, me, and Person Z set up a private system where the hashrate is to be fixed at 1000 GH/s, as soon as it goes to 1001 GH/s, we know that one of us is goosing the system. 2 out of 3 of us are going to go "Whoa there - something is wrong." and in short order, we will be able to know who that party is and deal with them according to the rules agreed upon in our private network contract. Since it wouldn't be you or me, it would be Z - and once Z is shown to have violated the trust, they are dead in terms of business - and the evidence is easily shown to anyone.
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:46:03
Why not B? The Bitcoin world ran fairly well when it was people using laptops and GPUs for mining. For 2 grand, someone can get 5.5 Th/s today. Just make the "buy in" for any participating company to be Xh/s where X is a reasonable enterprise-scale outlay of hardware but a 51% play (X x 0.51 x Y where Y is the number of companies) would represent a huge (and noticeable) initiative.
So if Company B tries to jack up their hashrate, everybody is going to notice because the rate should be flat unless/until someone new enters/leaves their ecosystem.
Also, nobody is incentivized to pool to make sure they get all the reward coins because that's not what this is about. Coins could be premined or just dumped into the system or just be distributed evenly to all participants because they aren't using them as money - they are using them as tokens representing ownership. 
In the meantime, you get rid of a lot of uncertainty. The network is impervious to outside attack - if any one player even thinks about screwing around, it's all right there in the blockchain and steps can be taken against them (maybe that's when pools are allowed to happen - to fork the bad player off into oblivion) and so forth. 
And again, they can develop their network at their pace. They aren't waiting for BIPs to get adopted, they aren't depending upon reward-focused external miners for anything. They can even test and add features quickly. Bitcoin has 6 talented core devs with an unclear process while a good IT department at a large institution could throw 40x that many talented people guided to a very focused set of goals and releases. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:37:06
I'm pretty sure nobody at NASDAQ wants to sit on Reddit or BitcoinTalk monitoring the situation the next time a pool nudges towards 51% and they prepare to talk to their clients that some of their trade data could begin to become (edit: un)reliable.

When it comes to power consumption, should we expect to see exponential growth or something more linear? The chips are getting smaller and more efficient and so the same power will go further in the future.
But right now if the whole network is at ~100k homes, a 100x network power consumption push puts it at ~10m homes. Which is the size of a megacity - of which there are 34 worldwide existing today. And that's not counting the subtraction of the power used by various banks/financial institutions which supposedly will go dark from disuse, so I'm not scared yet. 
Now add on that the network is clean power friendly -the solar, wind, etc options coming around can power them just as easily - and I am willing to wait and see how things shake out before becoming alarmed.

The people most responsible for Trump being president are those who supported and voted for him - aka the deplorables, people who aren’t necessarily racists or bad people but they just don’t mind supporting the same person those kinds of people do.
The people second most responsible for Trump being president are those people who were willing to sit on the sidelines during the election, threw their votes away for write-ins/Stein/Sanders, or even voted Trump out of spite after being spun up by Russian agitprop that told them that somehow something unfair had happened.

That the report is apparently so damning to Trump that he felt he needed to fire his first toady AG so that he could hire another AG who believed things like a President cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice on principle, tells me a great deal about what kind of stuff he felt was coming in that report. 
That the report has been blocked from full release without any real legal reason from either public or congress’s eyes tells me it contains some rough information about Trump and Russia.

2) Any links or co-ordination between Russia and Trump campaign-linked individuals. Note that does not end with collusion - it is also encompasses links, efforts of coordination, or even indirect cooperation. 
3) Any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation, including things like obstruction of justice.

Bitcoin...not so much. For as pro-Bitcoin as this news sounds, it's not displacing the role of the dollar in NASDAQ one little bit. 
All I am saying is that Bitcoin is a fantastic multi-tool that could certainly be used to address what NASDAQ has, which is if I may, a "phillips screw problem". However it may be the case that NASDAQ is better off setting up their own phillips screwdriver to use against their problem rather than relying on an uncertain multi-tool.

Let's be fair - you know what I mean. Very few people pick Android because it is open source. They pick it because there are basically 2 choices in software platforms for today's phones - Apple and Not-Apple (or Apple and Android) . Yes, there's Windows and Blackberry...sure, but again, the numbers... Anyway, that choice fork in the road has some broad implications about the apps they will be able to run, accessories, etc.  Meanwhile a OSX-running MBP laptop running OSX can run Microsoft Word just as well as a Windows-based dell runs Word.  So the phone comparison just doesn't get to the core of what we are talking about here when it comes to consumers making real choices.

Ok, but I am thinking of two situations. In the first, some upstart Bitcoin Mod code gets released and only 20% of miners and nodes run it and 80% continue to run Bitcoin Regular, then Bitcoin Mod is basically ignored. Doesn't really matter what Bitcoin Mod does.
In the second situation, suppose one day the PLA does 2 interesting things. One - they go to every large mining facility in China and ask that the operators run Bitcoin Mod. Operators that refuse are asked again with a gun held in their mouths. The assistant operators of those who still refused will likely comply once the ringing in their ears stops so they can hear specific instructions. 
At the same time the PLA also fires up Bitcoin Mod on a several banks of servers that represents an additional 10% of the network. Now the leading "Bitcoin" in terms of hashing power is Bitcoin Mod. Bitcoin Regular is the minority. Now of course, they can't change the code on your machine or mine, but we would basically be the minority coin on the same network, much like in the first scenario. Combined with some wallet releases on mobile platforms and whatnot and what "Bitcoin" is to most people could basically change.

Things is, we know "most people" don't care about Bitcoin (yet!), let alone which one is better. Many of the people who do know about Bitcoin are long-term hodlers who are just concerned that their coins are not valueless and see all else as growing pains.
So under my PLA takeover scenario, which uses Bitcoin Mod that provides the miners with some benefit or something a bit more sucky somehow - say fixed, minimum miner fees for all transactions, imagine is done in conjunction with their banking rules people, allowing only bitcoins on the Bitcoin Mod chain to be the only coin allowed. Government news reports this heavily. Interest begins to climb from a market of over a billion people.
Soon the rest of the world is either going to use Bitcoin Mod or be stuck with a 3rd/4th place, market cap-wise, with Bitcoin Regular. Slow converts would follow the hashing power/rewards/fees, draining that even further. No, the protocol you and I use won't change but does that really matter if we are some of the only people left using it?

The core of the answer from the main question about regulation (there were many other questions asked/answered):
"Yeah, absolutely. In the United States you have to get a license and that’s great, we are happy to get one, but you have to get one for all 50 states, do paperwork for 50 states, put up a bond in 50 states, so it takes a lot of time and effort. So for that, we are partnering with a company to launch in the US and essentially use them as a business license under their banner. Once we get to the market in the next six or twelve months, in the meantime we will get our licenses and bonds and whatnot and that gives us some time to test the market as well."
This....is not the worst thing. Unless this represents some sort of push for the Federal side of government to take regulatory power away from the individual states, which I don't think would go over well.

It would be a mistake to assume that cases of this scale are run solely by one agent. There are a lot of people and teams involved on a case and this information is reviewed - it's not just one guy in a corner - and I believe that part of that is what got this guy caught and charged (by this government we cannot trust) in the first place. A guy who, I should add, ought to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, no?
Personally, I am glad there is no actual victim. However that in no way absolves Ross from attempting to hire a hitman to have someone killed, regardless of the circumstances. If there were evidence against that - or real reason to assume the evidence had been fabricated - then I would be right along with you. However one agent's attempt at stealing from a drug lord in no way invalidates the fact that the drug lord is a drug lord.
However let's let "the market" decide and see if this revelation is significant enough to provide the foundation for Ross's appeal. If this is as significant to the case as the armchair lawyers would have us believe then the actual lawyers ought to make short work of his conviction.

Paper wallets are cool, but can be hard to work with. Of course you have to assume that your machine has not been compromised, that you're using a dumb printer (large corporate ones usually have a hard drive that keeps an image of every copy and print), and so forth. And you cannot do a partial spend of the contents of a paper wallet - it's all-or-nothing. 
Trezor makes it a little easier to spend from or even create multiple addresses. You still need a series of words to protect your account and you will need to safeguard that like the information on a paper wallet. This will let you restore the addresses locked down by your Trezor in case it is lost/stolen/burns up. However you can also set up an additional password/phrase which would be required to access your funds for usage or to do this restoration. This means the criminal can have your Trezor and your seed words and still not be able to access your funds. 
I think one of the understated selling points of the Trezor is that one can have multiple accounts (collections of addresses) that use the same multi-word seed but require different pass phrases to access/use. This means that if someone has your Trezor, has your seed words, and is standing over you with a $5 wrench asking for your password, you could give a pass phrase which leads to a "dummy" account that maybe has only a few bits (or BTC) - basically only a fraction of your full assets, which would be accessible with the same Trezor, same seed, yet using another pass phrase. However there would be no way for your attacker to know that there was more than one account on your Trezor.

Hmm...yeah, I think addresses is the more accurate way to say that. 
I'm not familiar enough with HD wallets yet to say if the usage would be identical, but it sounds like it.
But as far as the multiple accounts go, this I have seen demonstrated and feel this is a great feature to serve as a last decoy to the wrench wielder who knows you have a stash and so will not walk away empty handed.  One could also use it as a one-stop-shop for multiple parties to individually store - or find, in the case of a will bequeathing for example - bundles of coins without simply trusting each party to only take their share or work with only the addresses they were assigned.

Bitcoin needs an intact and reliable power and telecommunications infrastructure to be usable at all. General geo-political stability also helps - war zones are hell on cell phone contracts.

Overall, this would represent Mr. Paul's ability to access and process objective information presented in front of him. That is, there is a substantial body of scientific evidence in front of him and he is choosing to ignore it. That is not a positive sign for anyone seeking to be a responsible leader.
However the political implications are substantial. We are talking about various Federal subsidies, environmental laws, industrial regulations, and much more. Literally multiple billions of dollars at stake in any direction, directly impacting our nation's infrastructure and energy policy. And in a longer term sense, our nation's foreign policy where it comes to priorities based on various natural resources.

However the most important part there is that he is saying we "shouldn't pollute" - which in the climate change world might mean curb the release of CO2, methane, and other gasses that exacerbate the problem. However if one does not recognize that CO2 emissions, for example, are having an impact on climate in the first place, then CO2 cannot be considered to be a pollutant - which means there is no reason to try to control, regulate, or tax it.

Every critique of the initial iPad was valid - it was literally just a bigger, more expensive version of the iPod and had a name that, then at least, sounded like a female-specific product.

1) I used the WWW as an example of *a layer* of the Internet. I did not say that was what you said or claimed. I even prefaced it with "For example".
2) You are awfully cranky.


And people had no trouble whatsoever moving information around the world without the internet. Most postal services prided themselves on that ability, in fact. Calling people by phone internationally was very doable. Or even telegrams, etc. 
The commonality here is that such systems always required a third party. The Internet removed the need for the 3rd party for information transmission and even storage (like libraries, record rooms, etc)  And in finance, it's just the same. You keep mentioning credit cards and bank accounts but not everyone has those things or access to those 3rd party instruments. And all of those instruments require fees to do the transfers - somewhere along the lines, someone is paying - sometimes a lot. Either in direct fees, in raised prices charged by merchants to account for fees, or for various disguised fees (like the costs of maintaining a checking account - either through annual charges or through keeping your money tied up above a minimum balance.) 
There's a much larger world of finance out there and Bitcoin is in a good tool to expand outwards to reach more people and to make existing payment rails and methods cheaper/easier for people already in the general global financial network.

Re: Replicating the 21 Inc's service in an open source website.
I get what you are trying to say overall but I think this is your weakest point. Open source is pretty good at some levels but at others, people want the convenience, ease of use, and or the generally positive experience that many closed-source systems offer. OpenOffice has been developed and improved for years and yet has not stifled and killed the office products of Microsoft or even Apple.

I agree, but under those conditions at a certain point, people are going to stop thinking of acquiring bitcoins as "holding" and just thinking of them as "saving."  


I don't know how it becomes a policed micro-payments channel without 1) people being able to acquire them easily to make payments and 2) places that receive the payments being able to cash them out in volume easily. And then other people/groups will want to capitalize on that channel, repurposing it for other uses.

Few companies/institutions are ever going to allow you to send money to anything that the government might consider to be shady.

No, but I think your rush to dismiss what is being said there is misplaced. For example, the World Wide Web is not "the Internet" either - it is just one layer of many aspects of "the Internet" some of which predated the WWW.

You still have the same core "I gotta keep this seed somewhere", however that seed can control access to several wallets simultaneously while a paper wallet is linked to just one specific wallet.
Beyond just linking multiple wallets, you could also set up multiple "accounts" on the same Trezor such that if someone comes at you with the $5 wrench, you can give them a passphrase/seed combo that shows a set of wallets that has, say a fraction of your total bitcoin stash. Assuming your adversaries do not know how much you have in Bitcoin, you may be able to shake them off by giving up say, 10% of your stash with this tactic.

Future regulators? Present regulators are already clarifying that all this is necessary because the core purpose of the regulations is fundamentally medium-independent. As Juan Llanos puts it, ["The main mission of a financial services prudential regulator is to ensure the safety and soundness of service providers, thus maximizing to the extent possible the protection of consumers’ rights. This includes the right to have their funds delivered to the intended beneficiary in the promised timeframe, or the right for funds to be stored safely. In other words, the primary purpose of regulatory oversight is the protection of consumer funds against loss and mismanagement by financial intermediaries."](
Most regulators are not likely to see AML/KYC adherence as going out the window with Bitcoin (or other cryptos) - they just see value transfers happening with a different token and so the same fundamental rules apply.

No as I do not have a case against privacy. Overall I believe that absolute privacy and absolute transparency are untenable - and also unappealing - extremes. 
In this particular case, I don’t understand why because someone is using reasonable means to look through accounts in a public ledger, they must be compelled to expose their own financial holdings - including, I am guessing - assets outside of the public ledger. If someone wants to know what monies this person has on a(ny) blockchain, let them go through the same process this person has done and attempt to derive it themselves.

The simplest method to get to 2MB, 3MB, or 4MB is to simply raise the blocksize, which was arbitrarily capped at 1MB. Towards the goal of addressing immediate congestion, this would be the best and simplest way to achieve those goals while keeping Bitcoin what it is today. 
Segwit is an over-complicated approach that at best, lightly kicks the can down the road and absolutely changes how Bitcoin works, increasing complexity, and making users more vulnerable to exploitation. Given that, the motives of proponents of that system have been fairly called into question.

"What is your expertise to determine the simplest method?"
I am sure with a little searching about you could find many experts in Bitcoin development who have laid out very good cases for addressing our current congestion problems simply by increasing the block size. I don't think I need to be an expert to agree with them any more than I think you need to be an expert to agree with the Segwit approach. 
However purely on the face of it, the complexity argument simply cannot be rationally made. It has taken several months to prepare Segwit for rollout. By contrast, a block size increase required just changing the value of the existing limit and could have - and should have - been done over a year ago.
In the interim, lots of users have had delayed payments and/or paid higher fees - fees that made many transactions no longer make sense. 
"At best, it allows true scaling solutions...."
In my experience in software management, any time someone tries to pitch a solution that lists only the best possible outcome without also disclosing the inevitable tradeoffs or other negative outcomes, they are either ignorant of their product or are trying to con someone. 
"Go back to your trollden."
Ah, I see. I point out that good questions have been asked about the motives of people who resist the simplest solution to Bitcoin congestion and instead want to deploy a very complex system that changes how Bitcoin works, with literally billions of dollars of value on the line and I'm a troll. Gotcha.

Probably pretty well for them. They got what they paid for at the time and are hopefully alive and well to enjoy the run up to getting to go into space. Those people also bought a fair number of sandwiches in 2013. Also some clothes they liked. Maybe grabbed some games on Steam and had a blast. Went out on dates and fell in love or lust. Bought holiday and birthday presents for friends. Perhaps even ran their AC unit on hot days. Ultimately, they *lived* in 2013.
To look back from here and say they were foolish - they should have put the money they used for those things in BTC and definitely not spent any of it - that just doesn't make sense. The goal isn't money - money is just the tool to get the things that may help to make you happy (or at least shield you from the things that will make you unhappy.)
This year, folks will use the money they have today to buy more sandwiches, clothes, go on dates, etc and not just funnel money into BTC, even if BTC hits 30k in 2019. Considering that none of us have a guarantee to even live through to the end of today, let alone make it to that 2019 price, you're going to have a better life if you enjoy it now rather than living like a monk, perhaps indefinitely, for some fantasy lotto-like wealth to drop on you one day.

This is comparing a pond to an ocean - a loss of the same amount - say 10 gallons - of water is nothing compared to the latter but is significant to the latter.

Is that regardless of KYC tier?


True. The best way to fight these limits is to apply pressure to the government.


Well, except for if they don't, they could be fined or shut down by the government. Or even before that, if they are seen as flaunting banking regs, that will be seen as a risk by peer institutions - Visa, other banks - and so Coinbase would find themselves rapidly without any partners.


True - but probably not all, so...

Oh, I believe most of those international analysis systems are already firmly in place at the state level. Stitching together a profile based on access to banking records, IP addresses, phone accounts, and more definitely makes the job a lot easier.
The caveat to all this is that Bitcoin is not the only game in town and other coins and tokens will further obfuscate linking ownership and transactions to individuals. That said, it’s not like the world’s economy is frozen under current conditions where the private sector knows all about your money and will easily give that info up to the State.

I am not a deep technical expert at all but I have to ask, if the excess transactions are not processed in the blocks, aren't they fairly floating free of the guarantees and such offered by being employed in the blockchain? I'm thinking that Alice can send Bob a coin because the nodes holding the blockchain recognize that Alice has 10 btc in her wallet. But what if Bob then tries to send Cathy that same coin before that first transaction is encoded in the blockchain? Yeah, when it's in the same ~10 min window, this might be a rare problem, but if transactions are not being recorded for several blocks - hours or even a day or so - wouldn't such "weird-spending" be an issue?

Carrying my analogy further, if Alice-to-Bob's transaction isn't duly recorded in the blockchain, then can Bob-to-Cathy's transaction be checked as valid? Or if that one gets a "pass", what of Cathy-to-David's? I mean at some point there ought to be a way in which the blockchain becomes essential to ensuring transactions otherwise why even have it?


Yes, I am imagining a world where Bitcoin is suddenly popular and exceeding 3tx/s is the norm. Say running at 1% of Visa, so 20 tx/s, 24/7/365. The network never "catches up", so to speak. Eventually those sitting-on-the-side transactions may not going to ever be accounted for in the blockchain - perhaps buried further by having a low fee attached while a "fee race" happens. It would seem to me that at some point, the wheels would start to get wobbly. Sure by today's standards, one can ensure a transaction gets through by tacking on a higher fee, but in a tx-saturated world, that wouldn't help unless you dropped a "F-U" level of fee.

I'm not at all interested in trying to explain the short term dip - and I think it's not really possible to hold up Evo as the cause. If anything, after being in Bitcoin for some years now, I've found that usually there is no concrete reason that moves the price - it just moves as a given circle of people try to predict and out-maneuver the actions of the next larger (and slower-to-react) successive circle. It's basically like the stock market with HTFs at the front and pensioners at the tail end. [Really, McConaughey's character had it right.](
It's the long term damage to the pond that I believe is way more important - having yet another scandal where people run off with people's money is what hurts Bitcoin and Bitcoin's future prospects far more than any small price shift. And trying to claim some sort of mitigating aspect to this because their con "encouraged commerce" rings about as sound to me as saying we should all thank Madoff for getting more people interested in financial vehicles and regulation.

Both statements are true with either one being relevant depending on what you are trying to measure. Note that if the value of the rocks fluctuates, it is probably more sensible to describe the impact of the theft in terms of the percentage of rock changes rather than the value because for large value fluctuations, the theft could appear overstated or perhaps one might lose sight that even a theft occurred.

I won't hate on anyone who decides to live like a monk if that's what they are about in terms of conservation, self-improvement, or maybe just getting their life together. However we're all just a suspicious shadow on next week's x-ray away from having the BTC price in 2025 to have zero personal value to any of us - even if it's guaranteed to be $1m. So if you have some sort of dream play - like locking in a trip to space and then getting to wake up every day for 4 years knowing that you are (probably) going - then that seems to be exactly the right way to use your bitcoin(s). 
Living a life that satisfies you is definitely better than smauging away a fortune while living in a shitty apartment hodling out for some magic cashout threshold value that you have hitched all your hopes and dreams to. Because even if Bitcoin (or whatever) upholds its end of the bargain and makes you rich, that still doesn't mean you will necessarily be happy with who and where you are. Sure, you'll be able to surround yourself with toys - material and people - but that doesn't mean you'll *feel* great about them or want to "play" with them, whatever that means. Meanwhile, fending off those who just want to nibble away at your stash will slowly grind you.
Finish - "Mo money, mo problems." isn't a joke! Try to get yourself happy and content and centered before you have to worry about the negative things coming along with that BTC=$100k world that you haven't even imagined yet.

Because not one of those laws was passed by anyone other than an elected representative or at worst an appointee of the same.
Laws do not have expiration/revision dates so they are generally going to accumulate over time. That's rather obvious. Also, laws are made up and down government - town, county, state, federal. And, as a series of humor books told us, sometimes communities make laws that address a unique set of circumstances (or they are just having a laugh) that to an outsider may be silly. 
But that does not have any bearing on the case at hand nor say anything about the fact that if sufficient people in this system wanted to change or abolish pretty much any law, they could do so with fairly minimal effort.
That does not mean that some laws were dropped on us by Government - described as a cruel and malicious (yet also incompetent) race of people that invaded our peaceful and free world from the far planet Governmention. No, it means that the laws were put into place by elected representatives of the people (or their agents) and every second they stay in place it is due to the people in the community either wanting that law to be in place or not enough people not-want the law to be in place and are unable or unwilling to dedicate the energy required to change the law.
Not a lot of people "want" Charlie Shrem to go to jail. But a lot more people do not want him to walk out of a door that is flung wide open for all money launderers to engage in their actions. And overall, not enough people really care enough about Charlie to make a special exception or exemption for him or his set of circumstances.

I'm not looking at a "double spend" play, I am trying to understand how several subsequent chains of spending can take place when these transactions go unrecorded in an overwhelmed bitcoin network where many transactions will take days - if ever - to be incorporated in a mining block. This question isn't about trying to defraud the system, it's about how it behaves when overloaded. *IF* what I'm saying holds, it seems to be a huge negative case for letting the network hit the transaction capacity wall. But if it doesn't, then what happens would be good to know.


No - I just spend a lot of time trying to explain Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to new and potential users so I like to ask questions to the people who would know more to make sure I fully understand what I am telling others.

I can understand that sentiment, however if the payments system community refuses to be a "moral arbiter" - in other words is willing to allow thieves to profit - then they should not at all be surprised when more/new users demand that their governments step in to regulate said system to avoid such incidents in the future.

With all due respect, we should consider that the people actually in banking - fairly intelligent people whose livelihoods and careers depend on it - know a fair amount about banking, finance, and various implications. 
I'm not saying that you are totally wrong, only that when other smart people see something else, one might want to try to look at things from their perspective.


No bank wants to use a public blockchain that they have zero control over. Too much risk. Hell, we don't even know what how this big block size split is going to shake out - and that's just a couple quarters worth of foresight. This uncertainty doesn't appeal to banks. 


But there are plenty of ways in fuck you would use whatever bank service they have now? Because one way this shakes out is that customers *never* see this blockchain - they just use banking as usual and enjoy the big drop in fees, etc that blockchain usage allows.

Fortunately you started this off with an "if" condition that is not true for me, so we can skip past that. As pointed out multiple times in this thread, in a free market, it is up to btc-e and any other exchange to do what they like in terms of making sure they play a minimal role in laundering stolen property.
So I think I am free to say that I both understand the protocol, I am aware of the impact of any possible "regulations", and yet I still stand by the statement that for all the grand gloom/doom talk I keep hearing about abstract scenarios involving actions taken by "the authorities" and bitcoin, the only material threat I have encountered in years of bitcoin dealings are from other people in the community. The major losses this community has experienced have not come from sinister governments or failures of the technology, but instead have come pretty much exclusively from other people who have taken, swindled, or bungles the bitcoins of their fellow.
I think this is part of the disconnect that has impaired adoption as most people in the world today (and throughout history since the invention of banks) are less concerned with how to hide their assets from "the authorities" of government and more concerned about how to protect them from guys who aspire to rob them. It's nice to talk about how Bitcoin could be awesome at the former use case but to totally ignore the latter reflects a misbalance of priorities in addressing the actual needs of most potential users.

The hope for libertarians is not to keep trying for the White House, but to try for the State House and other lower levels of government.  Win some small elections, put some ideas into place at the local levels.

First device with a keyboard was the Atari 400 complete with a cassette drive that I saved programs which I hand-typed in from magazines.
Quickly went to an Apple ][+, got my first modem and entered the wild world of the BBS/phreak/warez days. I picked The Source over CompuServe.
Went to the Amiga 1000 because they were amazing. Hopped up to the 2000 because they were amazinger and ran Newtek's Video Toaster and Silver/Lightwave. This was right when Babylon 5 was out as both a good scifi show and a weekly Lightwave showcase product. 
Stayed in video and animation work - never quite getting that frame stop editor that would have let me output my work at the sought-after 30fps. Also, with no real training, I wasn't doing nearly as well as I might have. 
BSed my way into a tech writer/documentation job using PCs on a phone interview.  Couldn't stand the machines back then but I could understand $18/hr. Looked at the doc/drawing programs (Corel Draw sticks out) I would have to know, bought a PC magazine that had those products ads and asked questions based on the advertising. Stuff like, "Do you guys use blah module?" They thought I was a pro. Went to the bookstore, bought a "Blah For dummies" or "Learn blah in 24 hours" and crash studied for a weekend and walked in ready to go.
Some months in another guy told me to install this thing on my PC. Said it would let me connect to other computers in a new way. I did and was amazed. So many websites - some of them were fun! Yahoo was one of the places to be - they cultivated their listings by hand then. Search engines were starting up - one (Lycos?) used to keep a count of how many web pages there were in the world. I clearly remember looking at the number one day - I think it was around 50k - and asking another guy at work, "Do you ever think there will be a *million* web pages?"
Only my tech friends and early business contacts had email. A local printer balked at one of my video business card designs, because they did not know what the " thing was. AOL was considered to be a dead end space that wasn't the "real" internet at all. People slowly started to recognize it on television, with talk and morning show hosts stumbling over saying a URL - and they clearly did not know what it was for. Socially, it was all need-space stuff. Most people in the mainstream didn't care or, of those who did they often figured it was too complex for them.
Bitcoin feels a lot like those days.

"The Internet" is not the World Wide Web. There was a lot of stuff going on with the Internet and online communications before the WWW came about in any real sense. The BBS community - a sidechain to the Internet, if you will - had been thriving for over 10 years before 1995.
So I see where we are as more 1993. That's when the world shifted from Before Mosaic (ever use Archie? Gopher?) to After Mosaic. I mean, I want to point to services like Circle and Bitpay and Coinbase as being the equivalent but I don't see them as being as universally useful to users worldwide yet. But their time is coming.
But I definitely would not make the mistake of trying to peg the calendar of 20 years ago to ours. The world is significantly different in positive and negative ways. For one, all communications are faster. Lots of knowledge friction points are smoothed out in today's world. People, talent, information can be leveraged much easier than ever before. I mean, the existence of Github alone...mind blowing.
On the flip side, the world was a more docile, tamer place then. With a slow ramp-up to net connectivity, it took a while for malicious actors to really sharpen their swords and lockpicks with viruses, trojans, worms and such. It took a while before running one's own firewall became SOP - just don't run attachments and you'd mostly be fine.
Now? It's not the Wild West of the early Internet days - it's more like a Mad Max world. Very smart people and groups are right now trying to take anything they can get from anyone. And this is going to impair Bitcoin's growth as less savvy people get honestly and justifiably scared of wading into this pool. And this fear will (and is) working its way up the chain to governments. 
See - pretty much the worst thing that could happen in the early Internet days was you pick up a virus that wipes your hard drive. This sucked but not that much - you didn't have your music, photos, home movies, porn (ok, some porn), and the like on your machine. Mostly just documents. But today? Today we're looking at scams and attacks that will wipe out people's life savings overnight. And because that can happen, lay people are going to continue to be very hesitant to hop on board the Bitcoin train. The community's reaction to this Evo matter is telling as it shows that many people here just do not understand the priority most people place on not encouraging thieves.
I remain very hopeful that we can cross the Mosaic Threshold in the next year or two. THEN we can start looking for the Yahoos and even the Googles (not advocating for centralizing authorities - those names stand for organizations and tools that have instant and broad appeal) to start popping up. And if that happens, bitcoin's future is set.
If not, then it becomes VRML.

Fundamentally, bitcoin does not need to be expensive or difficult to acquire. I think the fee issue is more of a temporary issue than long-term concern because of scaling. Places and people charge fees because now that mining is gone, there isn't a ready way for people to get bitcoin. However if more and larger businesses come online and begin competing with each other then market pressures should start pushing those fees down.

If we're going to crystal ball things, we should probably just go all in and look at (far-out) economic projections of the world 2030, figure out what reserve currency might be 6th, how much that would equate to, and then redo that math, yes? For that matter, the number of bitcoins in play by 2030 would have kicked up a few, even with some halving cycles in there.
I mean, if we are trying to figure out how to save up for a proper down payment for personal space yachts and all...:)

It's not but considering that the Bitcoin world operates at a much smaller scale than the greater financial world, the effective pools of money are also of different scale. Operating from the idea that they are equivalent for comparisons sake is misleading. There can't be a $65b scam in the Bitcoin sector today because there simply is not that much money in Bitcoin. So yeah, if you want to game it that way, then Madoff will certainly win.

Perhaps the holistic view is nicer but in my travels I have found that so many of those who rally against "government" and their impact on their own "personal freedoms" are often also upset at many laws that curtailed their "freedom" to engage anti-civil rights practices. Even Rand Paul - when he was being an honest spokesperson for many in the libertarian camp - [said he would have voted against a significant section of the Civil Rights Act.](
So when I see such a comment, I don't gloss over the out-of-the-blue "faggot" part - I see that as someone likely expressing the kind of "rights" they hold dear. Kinda how like some would claim the US Civil War was simply a question of "states rights", while avoiding qualifying exactly what "rights" those states wanted to retain.

I do not believe that any of the people with whom I have had such discussions are even aware of the fungible properties of Bitcoin at all, let alone place it at a high or even medium priority for use. Personally, I don't even bring it up as an issue because it does not seem to be an issue.


Which is funny because volatility and the perception that everyone is getting ripped off in scam after scam in the Bitcoin community is the main stated reason why those same people shy away from bitcoin. These are people who are, believe it or not, generally happy with their bank and credit card accounts.
Put another way, a lot of people around here in the early userspace of Bitcoin may feel that the fungibility issue is a concern but this is not a sentiment echoed by 10-20x as many people who are deliberately not using it for other reasons more important to them.
@_date: 2015-03-23 00:46:52
It is so strange to look at one company's attempt to inhibit thieves from making off with stolen goods not as a good stroke against yet another large-scale rip off from users in the bitcoin community but as a fungibility crisis.

Time and time again the conversation keeps getting guided towards the threat of government intervention in bitcoin when in reality, this has nothing to do with this case.

Yes they have - and the doomsayers of 2008 have been horrifically wrong in terms of their predictions. Not slightly, but unbelievably wrong. Like we ought to be living in a Mad Max-like dystopia of guns and eating dog food by now as the Big Crash.
I dunno - maybe this world economy is so big and dynamic that it is resilient to whatever sorts of negatives the doomsayers toss at it. Obviously there are a lot of people - from laypeople like ourselves to actual powerful and intelligent folks who have real influence - who are working for (or cheering on) the economy. Perhaps their efforts ought to be examined, or at least respected, and it should be acknowledged that we are not all entirely in a pilotless ship.

See "the people" living at the time living in community after community, in country after country decided that they *did* want those freedoms to be curbed by various laws. This happened all over the globe in even the most free democracies. And even today, you will not find much support for abandoning speed limits, allowing nude people to hang out in children's playgrounds, or running bars out of their home. The first political candidate to pitch that will need to keep his or her dayjob because they won't get (or stay) elected.

I know if I had money stolen from me in this recent scam, I would greatly appreciate what btc-e was trying to do here and continue to support them.
Historically speaking, remember, people had all kinds of ultra-free markets and such and then they tended to gravitate to ones which offered more and more protections. That's one of the reasons why even in the most liberal democracies where the people truly captain their own ship, true open markets run under amoral libertarian beliefs just do not exist.

Well, we could pass through chaos, strife, famine, disease, and death in order to get where some may want us to go. Certainly the onus ought to be on them to make a compelling case to jump into that murky pool. Also, the proponents should make a much better case for the upsides of this new world that they seem eager to rush into - because it's going to be a very different place than what we know now. Pretending it's going to be like this world just with less taxes, for example, is incredibly short-sighted.

Each bitcoin is divisible to 100,000,000 pieces - there's plenty of currency circulating, we just have scaled it "wrong" by mentally locking the decimal point where it is today.
If a huge holder of coins were do dump out, it implies that the holder believes that it is more lucrative to get dollars than hodl bitcoins. Every year that goes by would make the impact of that sale even worse for crypto.

Remember what the core of what we are talking about here - it's Bitcoin regulation in New Jersey. Marco is seen as both a lawyer (someone familiar with the law), someone who knows finance in particular, and someone who knows about Bitcoin to some degree. Not many people can make that claim at all, let alone have the title of Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation's Regulatory Affairs Committee.  So any regulator worth anything in any state is going to know of him, if not know him directly.  Throw in that he's located in NYC - basically adjacent to New Jersey - and it is basically certain that he is going to be aware of moves in Bitcoin that lay people will not see.

Every time I have felt compelled to change a credit card number, I have also had to chase down places where it has been used for auto/regular billing, add in the new details, etc.  Ideally I won't forget any places, but forgetting some obscure subscription has happened and it can take more time to fix that.  
I wasn't aware that stolen credit cards info were auto-canceled by banks in the case of these bulk heists - I only use credit unions - but in the times when I have had credit card fraud happen to me, it did take a little more time to get things sorted (phone calls, faxing documents, etc) but I would get my money back.

Although you have made me think that if I should ever have anything of value like this, I should put it in a small fire safe and have a big unopenable "classic" safe put in an "obvious" place with some tricky mount so that a criminal spends a ton of time working on getting and stealing an empty box.

This is a chance for us to basically buy coverage on television!  If we each send him a little - I sent about $5 worth - and he winds up with a lot of coin, then some producer or writer is very likely to follow up with a story about the kid and how easy it was for people worldwide to send him money with just an onscreen flash of a QR code.  This could lead to more kids doing the same at other games and so forth.  
Please consider the potential positive media exposure here.

This is where you lost me.  I am reasonably sure you buy nasal spray by the fairly standard size (s) that the bottle it came with as opposed to going to a counter and requesting x-milliliters of nasal spray.  Same goes for most of those other products (I'm leaving out your penis), they have standard sizing and besides, most people are not calculating daily masses and volumes when they make these low-price consumer goods purchases, let alone recalculating these numbers all day long, hinging a child's education over quick mental math, etc.
When we're talking about personal wealth, there will not be standard sizes for reference and people are going to want to know exactly how much they have and how much they have to spend.

300 years ago many people knew that slavery was morally indefensible. Franklin didn’t invent abolitionism or just happen to hear of it later in life. 
The reality is that some people still decided that they would utilize slavery and many even enjoyed the very benefits of slavery. Even people who did not own slaves enjoyed the hierarchy level that this afforded them. So let’s appreciate that there were definitely pro-slavery people who utilized other people for their labor, station, and pleasure under penalty of pain, mutilation, and death.

Sure - there are 3 "sizes" which are presented in nice little SI units.  But for most people, you could say "Tall", "Grande", and "Venti" because that's all you're really offering them - 3 distinct, premeasured sizes with units they don't fully understand.  Most people don't nibble off 10mg from a 400mg tablet for now and pass 173mg to their friend, have 19mg put aside for an upcoming headache and then instinctively knowing about how much of a pill they have left.  And I haven't even started with using micrograms.  
Seriously, if Bitcoin's solution is "Let them eat math!" then this system is doomed because the first time some math averse person crosses up "micro" and "milli" in their savings account - or even hears of the same from a friend - to their severe disadvantage, then it will be their resistance to entry that will be going to the moon.

I'm working on a project in a metal shop. My plans are on my iPad on the table. As I'm doing some angle grinding to a piece on a bench clamp, I notice that the spark spray is coming too close to my device for comfort, so I move it to the other side of the table and get back to work.  What I don't notice is that the vibration from the grinding causes my iPad to "float" along the table.  I do notice when it falls on the concrete floor.
The screen is shattered and the case is dented.  As a bonus, I am leaving for a vacation in literally 6 hours and I promised folks on the other end I would have it with me, aside from just wanting it myself.  I call around to a couple Craigslist repair places but nobody has the parts or time to fix this thing, which is dripping glass shards.
I decide to try a Hail Mary and go to my Apple Store and see if maybe they can sell me a new screen. I can put it together later, just give me the parts, you know?  The guy takes it, agrees that it's hosed and it's entirely my fault.
They offer me a new one.  No charge.  Right there, on the spot.  It's not a warranty case - it's a "one time replacement" policy where no matter what, people could get a free replacement unit at no charge(*).  
I actually don't take them up on it right away - I dash home to back up my broken one and then roll back to the store and they just hand it to me and I walk out the door.  I restore from backup and get on with my life.
I'm not saying Android tablets are bad or even that the whole platform sucks, only that I have yet to see anything remarkable in Android that would get me to switch.  But as far as loyalty goes?  I have several hundred reasons (or over half a reason, if we're converting to BTC) to be loyal to Apple.  I don't know of any Android product vendor who has a similar policy or ability to carry it out (one of my local Apple stores is 24/7.)
(I have 2 other friends who each could tell similar stories about themselves and their wallets being saved by this policy.)

What if you looked at it like this - I would say that it is more difficult to purchase a hard drive via Cragislist than it is via a brick-and-mortar store.
Yes, you can scan Cragislist for awhile (depends on the size of your area) and you might even find the drive you want at a price you want in/around a place where you want to meet up to buy it.  Probably a couple phone calls or emails need to be exchanged. And if your schedules align, you may be able to meet up at a Starbucks or something at a specific time and do the exchange.  Sometimes - not always but sometimes - you can operate outside of the store's hours.  And it will likely go well - I've done similar buys all the time.
But still, I would say that it usually easier to buy that hard drive at a nearby store.

While bitcoin is relatively volatile (relatively because when it was younger and less capitalized, it wasn't 50% swings, but 90% swings), why would a merchant want to hold on to bitcoin?  They would just offer it as another payment method, get the bitcoin, give up the set, and revert to fiat.
Perhaps in the future when bitcoin stabilizes - it's harder to push around a 10 trillion dollar market than it is a 10 billion dollar market - then some places may hold bitcoin because the volatility will be just a few percentage points, but by then it may be to a businesses advantage to have assets in both fiat and bitcoin.

I think you could be saying 1 of 2 things - I'll try to tackle both.
If you're talking about moving coins from one address to another, this guy has already done this.  That he has custody of the coins is not in question -if anything, it damns him.  Everyone knows that those coins are in that address and can watch them flow from address to address.  They disperse?   The world can follow then to each of the subsequent addresses. Eventually when whomever steps forward in some non-bitcoin way to try to claim them is in for a world of hurt.
If the guy moves them to an exchange, that's another way for him to be tracked.  To have an account on a major exchange requires that he have given them at least some amount of traceable information.  While he may disperse the coins slowly through the exchange for cash,  there will be an arrow to someone's bank account when they finally cash out.  And again, cashing out ties the coins to a particular person.
So stealing bitcoins is less like robbing a bank of cash and more like art theft where stealing is just half of the challenge.

And again I am with you on the absence of wealth loss due to bank fees (although to be fair, they do make some amount of wealth happen on their own.) 
But here is where I'm going with the deflation thing.  In any environment, business wants to take in money and doesn't want to give it out.  In general, the business does not want to pay Peter any more than it contractually has to.  In the US inflationary economy, most businesses pretty much hold the line on there being a fixed dollar amount given to employees with occasional raises of small percentages given annually that (sometimes) outpace inflation.  
In a deflationary economy, a business is further incentivized to hold on to its assets just like Peter would like to.  Therefore, the idea that a business might peg Peter's BTC wages to some measured wealth value instead of a fixed number of BTC is pretty sound, no?  (Imagine the fate of a business that promised to pay an employee 100 BTC a week in Jan of 2013...)  Further, the business is probably going to recalculate that value fairly frequently - perhaps even per paycheck or even per an algorithm we haven't even seen yet that gives some sort of mean average over a pay period.   Basically there's a strong incentive to level out payroll (and other expenses) as fast as they possibly can in order to retain their ever-increasing assets.
However the prices of that same business?  They are not interested in lowering prices any more/faster than they must - especially when the currency deflates.  So while there will definitely be market pressure tugging prices down, there will be additional internal pressure to keep prices up as much as possible for as long as possible while scaling down Peter's wages as low as possible as quickly as possible.
So if Peter doesn't have substantial savings, he's not really going to benefit from a swelling savings account.  He's going to get his check and spend nearly all of his money on rent and food and whatnot - things that cannot be put off - and when nearly broke at the end of his pay period, finds he is going to make 1% less on the next paycheck.  Hopefully all the prices in his world also dropped 1% in this time to match but if they are fixed then he's gonna hurt.

I would disagree. On the whole, wealthier parents have the opportunity to devote more time and resources to the education of their children.  They can afford to live in - or move to - areas with better schools and better teachers.  This will place these children at a greater advantage when it comes time to pursue higher education or other opportunities.  These opportunities lead to access to higher-paying positions that are very difficult for other people to achieve on their own.  And so the cycle continues.
It's not that being wealthy intrinsically makes any child "smarter", it's that wealth allows any child to better and more efficiently maximize their capabilities and most of our society is structured to keep that going.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:14:42
People who have substantial savings are usually outside of what most people consider to be "poor".  Peter probably lives in a paycheck-to-paycheck world, assuming he can get a regular paycheck in the first place.

1) You haven't fully covered your use case bases here.  Your opinion as to who should and should not be buying/selling Bitcoins has no bearing on who actually does buy/sell Bitcoins.
2) There is no reason to believe that these people hold "very little BTC" - some people keep a fair amount of BTC in their accounts without moving them much.
3) People with money will always be targets of thieves.  Thieves that target exchanges directly will likely be grabbing what they can in terms of assets if they are able, not inexplicably ignoring accounts that have value at any level.  Thieves that target a specific person (or really, their access credentials) - for whatever reason - are likely to go in relatively blind (not knowing how much someone has) and will likely grab what they can when they can.
4) People with smaller amounts of money are general pretty aware of how much/little they have.  The idea that someone with small amounts of money wouldn't notice that they had less or none flies counter to what I feel is common sense.  In a general sense, folks who are broke know to the near penny how much money they have while many wealthy people utilize rounding (and enjoy the idea of significant "rounding errors" for some amounts) when they speak about their holdings.
In my experience with human psychology, those people who, when faced with a new idea, try to first understand what is good about the idea before trying to find the flaws in it are much more adaptable to change and generate their own innovative ideas.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:18:48
Again, many poor people often do not maintain savings of any sort.  They spend their income on subsistence-type expenses which, by definition of their being poor, takes pretty much all of their income to maintain.
I will agree with you that deflation is a general good thing for most people, but at the same time it must be acknowledged that it has less positive impact as one owns fewer of whatever is deflating.  And if one has none, the immediate savings benefit evaporates while the impact of declining wages is greater felt.

I don't take short sharp peaks or valleys as a "normal" upon which to base calls of "crash".  For me at least, any new price range that is very different from a previous range - positive or negative - has to be held on to for some amount of time for the change to be considered "label-worthy" or I consider it to be noise, and not representative of the will of the market.  Otherwise I think I could declare spikes and crashes several times a day, based on a relatively small number of trades.
