I really hope this guy's name is really Harodl.

Good old Harodl.

He would have been assassinated just like the other presidents who tried to go up against the Federal Reserve.

Not specific to cryptocurrencies, but investing in general.   Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Buy some of each (and the marijuana, too).  If this is your only investment, I would even find more things to diversify your investments with.

You would still only have 0.5 bitcoin.  But that half a Bitcoin would be worth now what a full Bitcoin+ would have been worth then.

I am just beginning the process, and don't even have my first products available and ready to be put up, or website or anything built yet \(don't even have a name I like for the company yet...\).  So I definitely have time to implement things if it will make it more convenient and efficient in the long run.
My main goal, would be to get the system to be the same workflow for my customers as fiat payment would be.  If it is as easy \(or easier\) in terms of the process, I think people would be more willing to use it.  Secondary to that, but still rather important, would be for the process to be the same or as easy for myself.  What I would like to avoid in the long run, would be for myself to have to be notified that I have a pending crypto payment, then have to go and monitor the transaction for completion and then go and manually open up download links for that person's account.  
I appreciate your willingness to help out with this.

I think most Americans do believe we are in a democracy.  Done of us realize it is Plutocracy, though.

To clarify something. You would actually still have x bitcoin. But the value could possibly go down and be worth 10% less fiat in the earlier example.

I wonder if there is some kind of automated way to be notified when there is a move of a huge amount of BTC.  Like if there is a 5,000+ BTC transaction in the blockchain, it could send out email or sms alerts or something.  
If there is a transaction that large in the near future, it's probably him getting ready to sell again. Would be nice to have some kind of notification or something.

It means that they are assuming you have an interest rate on your credit card of approximately 20%. Meaning you are taking a loan at 20% interest.
The "falling knife" is a reference to the free fall of BTC value as measured in fiat. Meaning you will purchase x amount of bitcoin, and within the next couple of days, you may have x-10% bitcoin, and would be paying interest on it as well.

You have to make sure that you look at the altcoin prices is USD (or the fiat of whatever country you live in) and not BTC.  That's the one thing that sucks about altcoins to me.  In most cases, you can't trade fiat for something like TRX or DASH.  You can only trade in BTC (usually also ETH and sometimes LTC, too).
So for instance, if the altcoin you are looking at goes up in value by $1, but in that same time period, the value of BTC raises by $10, then the altcoin's chart will still show a loss in BTC value, because it is worth less BTC now than it was at the beginning of this hypothetical explanation.
However, you can still make a lot more money on that altcoin.  Again, hypothetically speaking, say that at the beginning of that experiment that the altcoin was worth 1/100 BTC. You could either hold 1 BTC or 100 altcoin.  If you chose to hold the altcoin, your investment is now worth $100 more than before, where as if you had the BTC, you only gained $10.  But the chart still goes down because of the relationship of BTC to altcoin.
*EDIT: I am not saying that it sucks that you can't trade fiat for altcoins.  I am saying that it sucks that it isn't as easy to see a chart of the altcoin/fiat pairing.

That's not investing.  That is called gambling.  Nothing wrong with it,  but it is what it is.

I will admit, I am more of a sports gambler and less of a futures trader, so it may be really simple and I am missing something here.  But I thought I would ask for some clarification on it.
In sports betting, the term "futures" usually just refers to an event that is not happening immediately, or even something that isn't based on a single game (most sports books will already let you bet on who will win the World Series next year, for instance).
So in looking at your site and seeing the Ortega/Edgar MMA fight upcoming, it is listed as buy at 40.10 and sell at 39.90.  I don't understand how this would be settled.  Is it based on whoever wins the fight?  If so, what do 40.10 and 39.90 mean? 
In most cases at sports books, you would list an event like this similar to:
Edgar wins fight - (-110)
Martinez wins fight - (+110)
So if someone bets on Edgar, they have to wager $110 to win $100 if Edgar wins. Whereas if someone were to bet on Martinez and the wager was $100, then they would win $110 if Martinez wins the match.

Because we KNOW that the Federal Reserve has been lying to us since 1913, and Satoshi Nakamoto has not yet been proven to be a liar.
