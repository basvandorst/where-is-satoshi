This place is the best at times like this. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:30:49
You're the pleb dummy 
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:33:45
That's not how markets work. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:05:32
Lol. What consequences did you have in mind?  
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:40:41
I really think you guys should get past people using crypto for everyday purchases. 
If it was really that superior there would have been mass adoption. It's far too complicated for the average person and most people like that you can dispute a charge or have a bank protect you in case of fraud. 
You don't understand real life. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:31:46
Wow you guys post some trash on here. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:21:17
Lol wtf 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:20:49
Lol wtf 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:29:07
This is sad
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:59:56
Elaborate please? How are they scams?
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:12:55
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:27:43
God damn "believe in the tech" is just another way of saying - hope to God the price rebounds so I can sell 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:16:04
He believes it because all the retards in this sub saying, “bcash was literally designed to destroy bitcoin market” for months. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 04:03:30
Some honest expectations around here. Nice
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:01:55
Yeah. Stick your savings into a highly speculative and volatile “commodity” for lack of better word. Smart. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:39:27
It’s amazing that you guys blame bcash for all of btc’s woes instead of just admitting that it sucks for what it was designed to do. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:37:54
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:03:55
Delusional sums up about 95% of this sub
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:27:17
So ya found another retard who takes investing advice off memes... cool. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:55:54
Except it’s not worth the effort because nobody really cares/uses btc to shop outside of this sub. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:41:05
For the same reason people slow down past car crashes.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:09:43
Just stop already 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:28:25
Not gonna harp on and repeat the same advice you've already heard. But god damn son you should have sold. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:16:44
Big nah
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:36:06
I wish you understood what it meant too. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:40:51
Please provide the basic math to support value over $10k
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:28:25
Sell it dude. Cut your losses
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:05:23
Of course they need you social to open a credit card. How else do you think you get one?
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:41:59
The value dropping 70% in a couple months
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:44:32
Yeah, exactly. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:27:17
So painfully obvious. 
If he didn’t sell at 19k and thinks btc will eventually replace fiat why is he making price predictions? The price shouldn’t matter at all unless he’s trying to unload. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:42:09
Lol if you believe anybody outside of this sub has a clue wtf that means
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:02:00
Probably since it’s basically 80% the market
