No. No he did not. You have to tip if you want transactions to go through fast. There has to be incentive for the miners to include your transaction or else they will do it at their leisure.

Nice art. Sent you a tip: 
@_date: 2014-08-02 13:11:35
Bitcoin works off of a public-private key pair. 
You have your private key that you keep secret. And your public key that you want to share with people. A bitcoin address is just a hash of your public key. Just having the address won't allow you to transfer funds. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:04:26
People use cash everyday for most illegal transactions. Anyone who says otherwise is ignorant. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:47:18
You didn't include a fee with the transaction. You should include at least .0001 BTC to have the transaction included in the next block.

Stolen from Eric Voorhees, this is what I use to describe it.
Bitcoin is two things, a payment network and a currency.
* The US Dollar is a currency, and not a payment network.
* Paypal is a payment network, and not a currency.
It combines both of those technologies into one piece of software that is free for anyone in the entire world to use. It is cheaper than paypal to send money and has less inflation than the US dollar (because of quantitative easing). 
I usually go on longer than this but this is my elevator pitch.

Jimmy, before taking donations for the site PLEASE think about cold storage. If you need expert advice contact Andreas Antonopolous, he will gladly help you and assure the community you know what you're doing.

Just because Apple bans a wallet doesn't mean it gets removed from your device. I still have the blockchain and coinbase apps on my iPhone.

An address is the hash of a public key.

Simply putting your wallet onto a flash drive isn't cold storage. The wallet needs to be created on a computer that has never been connected to the internet. Use the flash drive to bring an unsigned transaction to that computer and use the cold-storage computer to sign the transaction.
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:11:06
I know this is going to be unpopular, but I use my coinbase app on my iphone. I know you can't get it anymore, but iPhone malware doesn't exist and the coinbase app works flawlessly.

I messaged you yesterday about this and never got a response. So the cooperative costs ~$10 to join, yet there is no way to pay this fee, and you randomly lock wallets that haven't paid. Why would I trust your wallet when I know that you're going to lock my wallet and not allow me to pay?
Edit: You were quoted as saying ...

They are flooding ads because the BTC/block drops from 50btc to 25btc in december. If they sell all their devices now, when the worth of it drops in december, they still got everyone to pay full price.

PRISM logs all connections by default regardless of whether the person who owns the server knows it or not. They can see what requests are sent to the server and what sites are being returned with time stamps. Piecing together your identity wouldn't be hard with a few days of logs.
