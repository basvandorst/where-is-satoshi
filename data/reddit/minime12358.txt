That's the chart that I found, but you might be happy to know it's in BTC, not USD. So lower trades are still higher volume in USD. 200k BTC = $3billion USD
Thanks for digging it up though

Just to verify, this only makes transactions off chain if one of two things happens:
You have created a channel with at least the balance you wish to use to a node in a graph that connects to the node you'd like to make the payment to.
You create the channel, so that you can make multiple transactions in sequence.
Are the majority of transactions of this sort?

DDOSes could result in losing money, if they last long enough (longer than relative lockout period). Hopefully that's an edge case, though, because you could just move your wallet/change internet in most cases.

Curious, do you have sources on that? I was trying to find those numbers but came up with very different (higher) volumes for btc

Actually no, the probability approaches 1-1/e, which is a bit higher.

I think it is a bit sketchy, but they need to assign a name of some sort. DPR CASE SEIZED COINS might be a bit closer, but they easily could drop the case and have it mean the same thing

Hey, thanks for doing this!  This is a really great idea

A block a day is a considerable amount. We are talking about approximately $15k every day. Regardless, it would be about 836 terahashes/second, which, with 1 th/s miners at 5999, that would be a little over $5 million. This is at our current difficulty and would take 334 days to pay back.
Realistically, you would not get 836 of these asics.

Perhaps I could be wrong, but I believe the vowel as actually lower than ɛ̃, though I am not a native speaker.

Oh hey, invites would be great!

Merry Christmas! I'm not sure if I am after 500 or not

At very least, not according to that quote. Those coins are allegedly DPR, or named "DPR SEIZED COINS" for the trial, unless I'm missing something?

Although incidentally, it's just 1 possibility because you can't change the combo on it.

Let's say their birthday is fixed. A second person has a (364/365) chance of having a birthday that is different. Scaling up, it is (364/365)^(N-1). Which is astronomically small for N=7 billion

I lost 8btc in mtgox. Kicking myself because it was my fault for being in an exchange

I mean, you likely were. Shoulda put that electricity or asic money to coins. Unless you were mining on computers that you didn't pay the electricity bill for.

This is old, I know, but I wanted to let you know: Future Bitcoin software can have finer precision. I don't have the articles on hand, but I believe it would certainly be possible.
Besides, with 1 cent satoshis, transaction fees would be rather large without further division.
