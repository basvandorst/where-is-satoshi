I'm guessing the hacker used Bitfinex's auth info to waive the limits. If you have evidence that BitGo did that, then present it.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:18:17
Bitfinex bragged that multisig was safer than cold storage. You don't have anybody else than Bitfinex to blame for this. If they couldn't legally have lending AND cold storage, then they just shouldn't have offered a half assed, unsecure multisig setup.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:04:05
BitGo wasn't hacked.
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:27:22
And that will happen because?
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:20:05
If you don't think this is related to Bitcoin, you don't understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:00:52
Well, Bitfinex does need to somehow communicate to BitGo that a given transaction is desired and to please sign it. Otherwise you're really criticising the n-of-m model.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:15:06
I'm not sure how you would implement meatspace when dealing with presumably tens of thousands of transactions per day. Maybe there really should be a human vetting everything, and the economic model just requires much higher fees. I do absolutely agree that the sudden withdrawal of 120K BTC should have triggered some kind of alarm. BitGo advertises fraud detection. Well if this didn't trigger it, then what would?
@_date: 2016-04-04 20:22:50
I wonder what the impact on fees is going to be. If every event on OB is turned into an OP_RETURN, that's going to be a lot more transactions happening. MFW "settlement network".
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:11:16
I heard you might move on from the StorjCoinX XCP assets. The total supply should remain the same, right? You sold StorjCoinX on the basis that the total number of tokens would remain the same?
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:42:57
It is. Individual miners that disagree with this are very free to join a pool that won't switch over to Bitcoin Classic. Clients are free to keep using software that ignores Bitcoin Classic. The mining pools are doors, not armies.
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:25:05
Well, it's live now! You can start using to save data or rent your storage space. So far so good, the software has already had a few months of real life use/patching/upgrading and is starting to perform pretty well. Can't speak for those other projects as they haven't actually launched yet.
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:45:33
No need to wait. Sia is already out, you can start earning now. :)
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:29:03
It's not really, it's just GUI/pinging stuff, the actual blockchain automated storage market is months from getting anywhere and probably at least a year from real world use.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:22:45
Hey, I first got into it exactly because I was eager to try something new, experimenting with stuff!
It's decentralised data that is shredded across thousands of nodes. Uncensorable, no central point of attack, etc... It's groundbreaking, fascinating tech. Just check it for yourself.
One of the things I like the most is actually because it will get more people into Bitcoin without having to bust out your credit card or pay any money.
Just leave your computer on at night and through the power of decentralised tech, you can beat the corporations and enter this worldwide informal post-capitalist [cooperative](
I'm just excited to tell people about it. A lot like Bitcoin when it first came out.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:58:54
Come on dude, it's up 100% from a few months ago, give it the room to breathe a little bit.
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:59:52
Yes, but the next version supports auto-renewal (you only have to open the client every so often). It's maturing really fast, don't take my word for it, check it out yourself when it comes out!
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:26:44
You can install [Sia]( and rent your storage space to people for crypto. Kind of like a solar panel that generates income.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:59:37
This trolls the troll.
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:38:43
Hey, it's getting better all the time! I am actually planning to upload several TB of my own data soon because I've never wanted to afford the usual solutions. It's a bit like the early days of Bitcoin, fun and often surprisingly reliable!
@_date: 2016-01-31 10:24:37
You have [Sia]( who is actually live and lets you rent space and host real world files.
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:06:23
Decentralised storage means uncensorable and fully encrypted, think Bitcoin applied to hd space. It's a real "cloud".
If you want to save large amounts say 10TB or more, Sia costs a fraction of traditional servers like AWS or Dropbox. Right now it's like 5 or 10% of what centralised services charge.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:16:16
I agree that Bitcoin has challenges to face, but throwing the baby out with the bathwater seems excessive. So far, though fees seem to vary and double spends can happen if you accept zero confs, Bitcoin continues to be used by lots of people around the world. There's no catastrophe happening. SW and other upgrades will happen eventually, and things will keep rolling. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:34:50
Just found out about another great project that might change your mind about "money" in decentralised systems.
[GridCoin]( is a Proof of Work that goes towards mining computation for [BOINC projects]( People contribute their computing power towards folding proteins, 3d rendering, etc...
This is not some money grab by greedy corporations, this is a way to rationalise and optimise decentralised networks for everybody. More people will join, the service will get better, more people will have a use for it. Everybody wins.
May I ask why you would choose to run a non rewarded over a rewarded network on your machine? I love this kind of grid computing networks (Bitcoin is at least as cool as SETI and I want other why there would be an irreconcilable division between the two when to me, everything seems to point to them uniting technologically and culturally.

I was replying to this question: [This may be a stupid question, but what's my incentive for spending $200-$300 bucks?](
Why are you annoyed? :)
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:03:19
Would you mind sharing why you think IPFS+Filecoin will beat Sia? I'd love to hear an argument in this sense.
I've come to the position that incentivised networks like Sia will outperform more loosely knit volunteers. You make it a real calling for people to deliver the best space, bandwith, latency, etc...
Also, as somebody who had to choose between a rewarded vs unrewarded network, why wouldn't I choose to be rewarded, even if only to help cover electricity costs?
Right now, a TB will net you something like 2-3$ a month. Not much, but that's still a useable real-world amount. Imagine what that can get you in some parts of the world.
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:05:34
Besides, money has its places, right? Imagine if Bitcoin mining was not rewarded and was done by people on a purely voluntary basis. I think Bitcoin would have been much weaker as a result, let alone not viable at all.
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:37:52
You sure sound like a legal expert!

At the risk of answering a rhetorical question, Venezuelans would be using Bitcoin much like anybody would use Gold to shield oneself from economic meltdowns such as the one in OP. What is your point?

[Augur]( is coming soon, nobody will be able to stop it.

It doesn't equate it, but it certainly has something to do with it my friend

People can choose their legal system by running the desired code. Plenty of people chose to stick with the old fork. Are you having trouble understanding this? 
@_date: 2016-09-23 06:44:05
I mean both Ethereums of course
@_date: 2016-09-26 19:39:32


yes it is. at the end of the day, it's human beings choosing to run the same code to play the same game


@_date: 2016-09-24 17:35:37
Wow, you sound really butthurt. Sorry my friend. Anyway if you are actually interested in the subject, look up the work being done in formally verifiable contracts
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:05:46
That sounds reasonable. If you don't get everything 100% right from the get-go, throw everything away. This is how software projects work, right?
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:47:57
Which one though?
@_date: 2016-10-21 11:17:02
Other things than Bitcoin existing really makes you mad, right? But just how mad does it make you? On a scale from 1mb to Unlimited?

@_date: 2016-10-20 09:30:02
But Bitcoin was hard forked because of a bug... So even your beloved Satoshi didn't get everything right. And what are you thinking of that "completely failed"?
@_date: 2016-05-10 20:12:31
Isn't this like supporting the Bitcoin protocol, except you're not connected to any of the nodes and blind to what's going on in the network? Like some kind of fork running on a parallel VM?
@_date: 2016-05-10 22:40:49
Right, so it supports the protocol, but doesn't actually connect to the Ethereum network?
@_date: 2016-07-12 16:01:04
But regulators can certainly stop an ETF from happening. An ETF backed by a currency created by an anonymous hacker holding 10% of the total supply. That may not be a problem to you but that seems unacceptable on an institutional level.
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:39:11
I think the actual halvening effect will be gradual and irreversible. There won't be much of a pump to dump on. It will be more of an increased upwards pressure.
@_date: 2016-07-12 18:36:06

Honestly, the doomsayers have been proven wrong. Now that wallets have been updated to handle proper adequate dynamic fees, Bitcoin is working fine. Yeah, micro transactions don't make sense, but that's the job for lightning networks. It seems there are a few being developed at the moment, XCP being in the lead (hand in hand with Storj). We'll see.
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:11:47
I think there is a really low chance of this ever happening.
@_date: 2016-07-21 18:00:07


Investors want their money back so they want another fork ethf2.
How many forks will it take? All the proforkers will choose which fork?
Amazingly enough, people will run the code and data they feel is best aligned with their own interest. Just like they've been doing since the genesis block.
@_date: 2016-07-12 16:39:39
Oh no I participated in a cutting edge fintech experiment, I must be wrong!
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:05:24
You're forgetting the dump after the hype. People will be taking their profits when they feel the halvening hype is peaking.
Of course we all believe on some level that long term holding will be profitable in the end but that's besides the point

You are getting confused between your utopian wishy washy babble speech and the strict requirements for an ETF to get approved.
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:17:28
I don't think these are ever going to happen. I am convinced regulators are trying to keep the foot down on crypto.
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:34:17
it's a tried and true trader strategy. you have to separate the buzz from the actual fundamentals.
people will buy in anticipation of something happening. the apex of the hype hits when the actual announcement is made, which is the best moment to sell off
in this case, bitcoin is expected to go through a supply crunch after the halvening. while that's true, the actual effect on the market isn't going to happen overnight.
one thing is the excitement around an event, one thing is the actual impact of it.
this is very much a day trader thing. if you are a hodler (which you should be), you won't be too concerned with playing with hype and bust cycles
i hope that explains things a little bit. feel free to ask further questions, it's an interesting phenomenon to pick apart
