Scaling is far less a critical issue than it will be.  Someone is forcing the issue early by spamming the chain.
This is a good thing.  If it waited to be addressed til it was a functional issue then there could be problems.
The attackers of the chain are developers and their investors.  Forcing profitability of development on the scaling issue by raising awareness.
They won't actually attack bitcoin enough to hurt it.  They're just demonstrating an issue that would have been ignored otherwise.

Segwit is more a contribution than in and of itself a solution.
Scaling is far less of a problem than it appears to be *right now*.  Spam is inflating prices and forcing the issue, which is a good thing because the problem needs to be addressed before it becomes a problem.

What? No.  Began the year with 1k flat on the money (NPI).  Gradually went up til it peaked at 2.8k end of June.  AB/Hansa popped (So did Dream but they just migrated the servers to Quantico) early July.  Crashed to 1.8k within a week and rebounded over the last month to 4k+ as TradeRoute overtook Dream.

High fees make mining profitable.  Profitability of mining increases the security of the network.
This is a good thing.  Dope means real world markets have customers willing to pay the tx fees.
A layer might see brick and mortar adoption but I personally don't think bitcoin *should* scale well and rather operate as a backbone for bigger players and their layers.  
So, in summation, high Tx fees are a good thing and regardless of "what reddit wants" have the muscle to do naught but increase.

I observed the market and have a familiarity with the street market.
You don't understand just how aggressive the dope market is.  Most commodities markets have buyers willing to wait for a reasonable price.
I have no shame in admitting I've used psychedelics to my own benefit.
For the same reason I refuse to engage in the drug trade.  Money is deceptive and seems to be of benefit but it is not therefore I refuse to engage it.
My experiences have shown me just how possible and real the market is and while it's limited I Have no shame in confirming it is real which was the sole purpose in my investigation.  Being that it is real and comparing street to dnm shows a thing that will revolutionize society.
It's a field of study for me, not an addiction or a lifestyle.
The profit potential for folks willing to engage is obscene.  Traction at this point is infinitesimal.
What you are seeing now is miniscule compared to what will happen when folks learn how to use the next great equalizer.

The term "concensus rules" kind of says, "you're absolutely wrong."
So miners make up new rules and fork the chain.
People use core and not the fork.
Core stays valuable and fork is worthless.
Miners don't get paid for mining fork and changing rules.
Miners get paid abiding the *users' consensus*.

Y'all stuck in the past.  Speculators have about the same influence today as they had before.  ~$300 of flux tops.
The floor is set because TradeRoute accepts Monero, multisig overtook Dream.
The bottom out of $1.8k was a panic when AB/Hansa got popped and dream went to quantico and everyone just kind of backed off til the dust settled.
Operations ~50% restored on TradeRoute.
Guy was right when he said $6k.  That will be a gradual climb beginning next week as vendors migrate.

You're looking at pure volume.
What I am talking about is a willingness to pay.  Spec and non-dopamine hijacking markets don't have the aggressive customer base these people are working with.
This is just a test volume and it is a critical component of the price stability we are experiencing.  
The fact that there are functioning DNMs after the takedown of the big three is proof positive that the method works.  Once that fact was worked out we are experiencing a buyer surge that will see 1bn before the end of the year go down on TR.
I'm not talking about what has happened in the past.  I'm talking about something that is happening *right now.*
A lot of people freaked out about the takedown but the real operators that weren't busted because their OPSEC was tight just got promoted and are multiplying their business an order of magnitude.  Only about half that is consolidation.
One thing you aren't accounting for is that the real weight movement is not occuring on the DNM but it is occuring with bitcoin over tradition networks because bitcoin is vastly superior to cash.

Stagnant currency traditionally deflated a market.
With respect to precious commodities,  deflation chokes the economy by negating the presence of the currency and therefore its function.  Because of this the principle of relending &amp; investing were swindled into the fiat system where it syphoned value from the labor class under the guise of hoard salvation from the likes of hoarders.
Active manipulation of capital is still a reliable mean of do-nothing profit with bitcoin.  And so, current models of value representation management, when attempting to adopt bitcoin,  reveal the audacity and degeneracy of the man behind the fiat curtain.
Still, many are so entrained to such models that they fail to see the obvious post-revelation.

A law firm can act as an estate executor as they would for any other property if you have enough wealth to need a live agent, outside the family, to validate death and initiate a chain of transfers that result in the dispersion of your cryptocurrency to your desired heirs.
The estate executor should be given a key.  Ideally, in the near future, birth and death records should be validated on a block chain, until then, you partially trust this lawyer to conduct the affairs and not before your death.
In any case, the lawyer should hold a sealed, tamper-evident envelope containing a password.
The prime beneficiary should have a safe deposit box in their name containing a thumb drive.  The bank may even serve as a second checkpoint for death refusing to open except for self or prime upon proof of death.  Since the bank gets paid the longer the box is held they have incentive to hold.
The thumb in the box contains an encrypted file.  The lawyer's password should unlock the file an reveal a list of publicly hosted addresses containing copies of a file which may be decrypted with a key also included.  
Finally, the decrypted file on the thumb would render a signed transaction from your primary BTC/whatever account to an address the lawyer has a presigned mulitsignature transaction which sends everything where it is intended to go.  The lawyer is responsible for making the third party signature upon this transaction.
Any extra miscellaneous funds can be kept up to date with encrypted files held at the list of mirrors decrypted from the thumb.  Where interested parties would find an encrypted file whose key was on the thumb and reveal presigned multisignature transactions.
Destination addresses for beneficiaries not inclined to manage their own wallets can be directed to extra thumbs contained in the box.  Letters with keys distributed by the lawyer.
Why this works.
1 - Updateable via public hosting of encrypted files mirrored around reliable hosts.
2 - No party can act alone.
3 - The higher the stakes, the more parties can be added to the chain of trust.  
For example, If I had a billion USD + equivilent crypto estate, I wouldn't see it excessive to separate keys between at least three law firms who collect bigger bounties than they collect  from paying out the estate to keep each other honest (rat each other out if they try to collude before death).
Arbitrary delays between the publishing of presigned transactions could further (PSX invalid unless 2, 10, 100, whatever confirmations past deposit).  Multiple hope between origin account and payout could serve to alert self and/or a third party (say, a PI who gets paid after confirming your death or can begin legal injuctions to stop proceedings on your behalf if you are indisposed but not dead (coma, kidnapping, etc.) as well as pre signed transactions to foil the prearranged chain of transfers.
The more crypto, the more of an asshole you can be to your money grubbing relatives who should have listened to you about crypto back in the day.

I don't hate women.  I respect the way things are without any need to subscribe to or push a narrative.  If you have your head so far up your own cunt that you're threatened by revelation, then your shit is weak and I don't care to hear from you either.

Everything ever alive is because sex.  What makes *you* think sex is even possible to remove from the negotiating table?




Call it what you like.  Ignoring differences serves no one today.




No.  It doesn't.  You're just saying that.  It isn't true.  I choose my words carefully these days but not for anyone else's benefit.


What are you?  Palantir?  I doubt that but the claim is noted.


You recite rhetoric religiously.  It defies the truth but illuminates the ignorance contrast your godlike claims of omniscience.




I don't.  Usually, my sense of humor detects it before any sense of doubt can develop.


Not even my sense of humor is calibrated to detect this.


I don't give a shit if it's racist or not but it's true.  Sure, much of it is culture and what the environment teaches.  Regardless, to not recognize an individual's unique aptitudes because you're color blind is retarded.  Things have changed more than can ever be addressed in this medium and it's making everything stale like moldy bread.
Literally.  I mean that it impedes development.  Make of that what you will but mind that I mean a thing in particular and if you miss it, that's not my failure.

That's not all that bad.  It'll just be a dip.  Dips are good.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:11:47
If that were true, you wouldn't have behaved so poorly.

Carnarias is better.  Taragui is cheap.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:05:03
You're deviating
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:50:21
Confidence in being right isn't smarmy.  You began the insults and so lost  position.  Good day.

There's only one realistic limitation to Bitcoin: 13M

Did I say I don't like them? 
I'll say this.  Opinion is irrelevant.  Mine and yours.

What's the difference between Bitcoin and Jesus?
Jesus might come back down again.

You mean, "commit suicide" after refusing to cough up cryptocurrency keys?
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:00:32
Surely, but not against the insults and claims of children.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:58:41
Yeah, in China it wouldn't have made the news.
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:25:22
Yeah but STFU.  That's why I ain't tryin' to spend it on a couple of hos here, aight?

Perhaps it is a premature achievement.  I propose the helicarrier rather than conjecture it.

Liar, that's your Bitcoin account.

It's just computer money.  How can you trust computers?

You're ignorance is glaring in the presumptions you make about me.  This will reveal your mistakes should you choose to confront yourself.  I care not for your development.

The DEA would like you to think so anyway.

That is not religion.  Religion is what binds people together outside of the families they come from.
Mutual belief is useful for such but do not conflate the product with the tool used to craft it.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:54:11
Until it did.
The moral of that story is literally the opposite of what you are trying to say.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:23:01
Dope.
