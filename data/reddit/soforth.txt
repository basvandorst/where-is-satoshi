How? If someone had your password, 2FA and email access, how in the world would coinbase know whether you transferred the funds to an address or someone else did? How would they know who controls the address on the other end?
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:38:24
Perhaps, but it doesn't sound like it was CB's fault. They are just processing the payment. It is the merchant who didn't follow through correctly.

So wrong it's hilarious. Thank you.

I have no idea what he's talking about, but you could send a single Satoshi with no fee right up until the blocks filled up in 2015 - though it would take a little longer to get picked up by a miner. That would be 1/100,000,000 of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:44:54
Could you give some examples?
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:12:14
Yes, apparently we are defining it differently. If I open a store that accepts USD, or a currency trading brokerage, or a bank - I am not "building on top" of USD. 
When I got interested in BTC in 2013, it was because it was "programmable money". Bitcoin was to be a platform for decentralization, not a store of value with no additional utility of it's own. But the programmability has been successfully killed. It has gotten so slow and expensive it is good for nothing but trading and holding.
There are real decentralized services being built on top of decentralized crypto platforms. A few of them will change the world. It's sad that it isn't Bitcoin. It's even sadder than people don't see what happened.

I'm bullish on the whole space - but to answer your question: a state actor could pretty easily starting mining, and sell at a loss to collapse market prices. With enough resources, they could execute 51% attacks to make the network unreliable. That should not be discounted as a risk.

If holding and dealing with your own private keys was a requirement of using bitcoin there would never be a chance of it going mainstream. IMO Bitcoin is about freedom of choice. 
If you want to interact with bitcoin by having a brain wallet and running your own node, that is great. But if someone else just wants to buy from Coinbase and keep it there, that should be fine too.
Edit: not to mention that, as far as I know, there aren't any banks that will exchange your USD for bitcoins. That is a valuable service that cannot currently be provided without a 3rd party.
@_date: 2015-12-28 02:18:04
The point is that you can still do that. Coinbase does not pose a threat to other "direct" wallet options. Providing a variety of options and a way to easily get into/out of BTC is a good thing.

This seems like a really clever solution. Am I right to think that no changes to the bitcoin code are even needed to implement this? I hope we see a test case soon.
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:49:12
He's wrong. Your IP has nothing to do with the blockchain and is not stored. If you go to coinbase or another site from your home computer, someone could theoretically find out you went there or any other website using a tracker. They wouldn't be able to tell who you sent money to or received it from though.
The reason bitcoin is only psuedo anonymous because the blockchain itself is public, though it only displays public addresses, which can be created at any time. If someone knew you used an address at one point, they MIGHT be able to do some investigation and find out where else you sent the money. This is not easy to do, though, and if you take some precautions you can make it nearly impossible to track. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:39:18

Sorry if I wasn't clear. They wouldn't be selling them for $220, they would be buying them on gox for $220 and selling them elsewhere for a profit (i.e. arbitrage). Since they bought so low and have been waiting so long, they would be willing take prices far under the current rate on other exchanges, making the price fall.

Verification can be annoying, but it is a result of US law more than anything, and  I would not call coinbase's process especially clumsy. IMO, they have proven to be responsive and competent overall.
That said, you may have better luck with localbitcoins.com or the local trader feature in the mycelium smartphone app.
@_date: 2014-04-13 05:55:26
This is something I had not thought of, and it is a major benefit to sidechains. The barrier to entry for new types of coins would be much smaller, and it would also eliminate the need for some types of potentially competing separate  coins while securing the btc protocol into the very foundation of others. In that case, allowing such a change and any soft forks it might require would surely be in a miner's long term interest.

I disagree about r/bitcoinmarkets. They see their share of trolls, but also honest skeptics and bears. And that is a good thing. I am extremely bullish at the moment, but I value opposing opinions as it gives me chance to weigh the risks more accurately. R/bitcoin, on the other hand, has become almost completely useless to me for informed info and debate. Dissenting opinions get buried immediately, while tired jokes and misinformation have become the norm.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:17:49
As much as I hate to defend Gox, the withdrawal queue might be the best thing for the market as a whole.
Here's my thinking: The current price difference between Gox and everyone else means that if/when they resume withdrawals, people will have the opportunity to turn around and sell goxcoins that they bought for as low as $220 on other exchanges. If everyone is able to do this at once, it will crash the market.
However, if the coins are released slowly, it will give Gox a chance to balance with other markets and instead of a crash you will have sell orders distributed over days or weeks. Once the price balances you may even see some people keeping their money in gox - no matter how stupid that may seem to the rest of us.
That said, I would probably be anti-queue if it was my money stuck in gox.
@_date: 2014-07-15 22:21:22
You'll have to use your own judgement, but I believe coinbase is probably the most trustworthy as they are well known, well funded, and are based in the US. You can link your bank account and purchase right away, though it will take a few days to show up in your account (eventually you can get a higher verification level that will allow you to purchase instantly).

Why do you think a true free market would not lead to accumulation of resources by a few? Again, it seems self evident that even minor inequalities will be amplified as those with power/money use it to gain still further advantages (through monopolies, war, politics, etc).
@_date: 2014-07-15 21:55:41
Credit card purchases can be reversed. This means that if someone bought btc with their credit card, they could then call their credit card company and claim their card was stolen or that they didn't receive their bitcoin or whatever, and the company selling them would be screwed.
However, right now purse.io is allowing credit card btc purchases at premiums of 10-25%. They do this by allowing you to buy items on someone else's amazon wishlist. When they receive the item, you get your bitcoin. I'm guessing this will not last, though, since it exposes amazon to the same type of chargeback fraud.

I appreciate that. However, liberty would not be possible is a world of objectivists, where each is looking out only for their own best interests. Money buys money, power accumulates power. Eventually this process leads to a disparity which undermines the liberty of those who are not at the top of the heap. Furthermore, those successfully accumulating money and power are not Dagny Taggarts, they do generally start from level ground and succeed only through their own pluck and industry; they mostly come from privilege and have more opportunities and less barriers than others. Equal opportunity (not outcome) is necessary for liberty, otherwise it is simply an illusion, and a self-interested ideology such as objectivism is antithetical to equal opportunity.

The graphic itself makes a minor point in a lighthearted way. It does not contain any "to the moon!" delusion, simply points out that many banking services (e.g. deposits, transfers) are only available during business hours, which coincide with many people's work schedules, while these services are always available with bitcoin. It has also been voted to the top of the subreddit. Yet if one were to judge from the comments and their scores, I would think this was r/bitcoinsux. That does not seem normal to me.

You can buy bitcoin with no fee if you deposit funds into a Coinbase USD wallet, then move the funds to Coinbase Exchange. Place a "post only" limit order near the market price. This guarantees that it will be a "maker trade", which has a 0% fee on Coinbase Exchange.
Good luck!

Not really, and you're missing the point. The important difference between Bitcoin and PayPal is not speed, cost, usability (all of which PayPal does better) - it is the fact that Bitcoin is permissionless and censor-resistant. This is true for defi applications as well.
I am setting aside the fact that what Maker is attempting to do (permissionless stablecoin backed by collateralized permissionless loans) has almost nothing to do with what BitMEX does (high leverage options trading).

I have a mostly positive opinion of you personally due to your history on r/bitcoinmarkets. However, as a neutral observer, I find your description of this situation to be inaccurate and biased.
It's true the r/btc can be somewhat unpleasant due to it's seemingly single-minded obsession with blocksize and with bashing r/Bitcoin specifically. However, this reaction is perfectly predictable, and even rational when faced with the very real censorship which continues to occur on this subreddit. 
The resentment of theymos and overall moderation policies on r/Bitcoin is no fringe opinion, as evidenced by this post and the comments here. The very existence and popularity of r/btc backs up this fact. 
In other words, I believe the anger and divisiveness you cite is not the result of poor moderation elsewhere, but rather the direct consequence of the policies enacted here. To believe otherwise is only to fool yourself.

Coinbase is a victim of its own success. Their user base has grown 10x in a couple months and 100x in a year. There is bound to be some lag between that explosion in growth and the availability of support.
And why did that growth happen? Because they have built a great product that delivers btc to the masses, and they've never been hacked. That is more than most exchanges in this space can claim.
If anyone should know the difficulty of scaling up in the face of overwhelming success, it's the people here.
