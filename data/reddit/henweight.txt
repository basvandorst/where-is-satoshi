The law of supply and demand does not in any way say that if a type of money is easily lost that other people get richer. Supply and demand contains both supply (which goes down) and demand (which also goes down when a currency is fragile)

It's because of mtgox. 
Like no one wants to talk about that but bitcoin has still not actually recovered from mtgox's exit 2 years ago and has been in a general downtrend for the past 24 months with only small and temporary reversals. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 14:51:35
The thing is, there is no actual urgency about the block size increase bitcoin is not growing enough for it to be a real issue for literally years and years, it's ALL about the governance stuff. The blocksize stuff is a foot note that doesn't really impact anything this decade.

Bitcoin is down 5% in 24 hours, 16% in one week, 25% in a month and down 57% in the last year. 
Why act like bitcoin is going both up and down rapidly? You need to go back multiple years to find a price this low.

I guess? I just don't see what reason there is to buy and hold bitcoin on faith it will make money at this point, like I can see using it if someone somewhere actually has a use but it seems like the time to give up on the idea of holding bitcoin just for some dumb speculation. Especially if everyone admits the last part was fake.

Unlike almost all other actual protocols bitcoin's protocol doesn't have a real laid out definition and is just "it's whatever bitcoin core does" so there is a ton of weird idiosyncrasies that everything has to follow bug for bug.

A good point if home mining actually did anything. Bitcoin was a good idea when it was envisioned as a p2p thing where every user mines and uses the blockchain.

Okay, but the point is that increasing block size is pretty meaningless. 
Jacking it up 100,000% what it is now gets us to .5% of visa's current capabilities. It just doesn't even help scaling beyond changing a tiny number to a slightly bigger tiny number. Block size doesn't solve the scaling problem at all.

Bitcoin is really slow, 10 minutes is only the average.

Seems more short sighted to ask an economics guy to write a sci-fi story about technological change instead of letting him write about economic trends. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 14:23:11
It's spiked to be 10% lower than it was even a month ago, it's just not that important a rise. Who is going to celebrate the price not even recovering to where it was a few weeks ago?

Is keeping explosives in your apartment and selling them through the mail illegally also above the law? Why would anyone listen to ver's idea of how the law works? 
@_date: 2015-09-13 17:27:33
Everyone also oddly conflates it with a price graph which it is not.
@_date: 2015-09-11 01:21:34
Only down 10% since 30 days ago!

In a bitcoin world if they were hacked someone would have stolen all their bitcoin and they would be destitute. 
How is that a better situation for anyone in any way? 
@_date: 2015-09-13 20:03:12
Well the price has been generally falling for a year and a half, is there more or less applications running on the blockchain? 
@_date: 2015-09-12 23:57:24
This whole thing is ignoring that banks DO offer the service you are looking for. You are absolutely free to get all your money and put it in a safe deposit box and have this exact service of having all your money in cash held by a bank in literal terms on demand. If what you are looking for is instant access to cash specifically they have services for that, if you want checking or savings or CDs or something they have other terms and are for other things.

14 million users is over 10x the number of users bitcoin has

"many" major retailers don't accept bitcoin. Like maybe 4 'major' retailers accept bitcoin for specific things through coinbase.

Can you imagine if africa made it's own crypto, and enriched it's own people instead of a bunch of westerners that feel dead set that they deserve to have a bunch of african's money for buying in "early".

Okay, and then 7 years after that?

Doesn't mark kepels literally own the trademark on 'bitcoin"? I guess only he can decide which is the way to capitalize it, not some random reddit community.

Are you under the impression protocols never fail or go away?

Misusing some weird business account with some sort of shady middleman seems like an extraordinarily good way to get scammed or lose your money.

congratulations for making what is a simple transaction into a really really slow and complicated thing where you pay a fee to do it. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:04:57
What a BS excuse. A million other technologies way more complicated than bitcoin had no trouble getting adopted. I would say basically every internet protocol that exists is too hard for most people to understand but they all seem to do just fine. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 14:20:24
Yes, he wrote that as part of some sci-fi story set 100 years in the future and removed the internet from the story so he could write about economics in the future without having to deal with the part he couldn't predict. It wasn't an actual prediction, it was a story element to keep from having to write his whole future narrative based on an unknown. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:14:56
If for the average user it's better to not use bitcoin as a p2p currency why not just tell the average user it's best to not use bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-09-16 21:29:36
Be your own bank. If you are giving your bitcoin to someone else to be handled then why shouldn't they follow the laws about holding people's money? 
@_date: 2015-09-14 02:15:46
None of that stuff requires bitcoin at all though, why would bitcoin need to be involved at all in any of those suggestions? 
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:32:21
Is that that slick? That doesn't seem any more impressive than the million other apps that do that without bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:37:56
Okay, but things DO get hacked, in this case target got hacked for credit card numbers, this is unfortunate but target still can open it's doors the next day. In a world people pay with bitcoin and target holds bitcoin then the hack would steal all target's money and end the business named target. Which is not a better situation for target than being sued. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:26:53
Oh, so basically bitcoin isn't as good as the systems people already use, got it!
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:57:07
They were literally the third party because person to person drug for money transactions didn't work without that middleman. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:36:28
Neither of those situations seem even remotely similar. This isn't some guy selling all his bitcoin by accident, this is some guy accidently getting charged a massive 1000+ dollar fee .  
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:10:51
Cool, next time time magazine makes a 100 year anniversary issue you should call them and tell them the rule that every story needs to be about technology and no other types are allowed.

In 7 years or more almost nothing accepts bitcoin. Why is that going to change? 
@_date: 2015-09-16 21:09:26
Bitcoin is down 1% since yesterday, 4.8% since a week ago, 11% since a month ago, 50% since one year ago and 80% since the all time high. 
If that isn't a recession I don't know what is. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 23:43:05
The whole point of bitcoin is that you store every single transaction that has ever happened anywhere on earth. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 00:08:41
It only launched a month ago in the UK, so no shock you haven't seen much of it but here is a dumb graphic listing all the places it's accepted. Looking at these places it's likely there is more stores in the UK that take apple pay then there are USERS of bitcoin on planet earth.
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:27:28
Okay, but you alone should be able to run like 500 nodes on your unlimited gb internet you have, but there isn't even 500 in the entire place.

It's worth less regardless of if he spends it or not. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 11:27:10
I think "reassure" is the exact right word and you are going out to look at weirder and more obscure indicators now that the traditional ones like the price are in a dumpster and august was the lowest month for VC investment in the last two years and the volume and node count both have known manipulation and still fail to be particularly impressive. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 14:47:49
The internet had 14 million users in 1993, bitcoin maybe has 750,000.
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:56:26
You could do it in a decentralized way WITHOUT a blockchain. Do you seriously think satoshi invented cryptography or something? Just because he invented a very specific use case doesn't mean every single concept needs to be shoe horned into that specific model. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 11:18:56
Why not monitor things to get an accurate picture instead of finding things to pray over to restore your faith like the guy below reading the whitepaper?
@_date: 2015-09-07 22:41:38
okay, but how does a blockchain help with that in a way some other cryptography based thing wouldn't. Are miners mining windows licences? 
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:58:37
You can also use hashes without blockchains, satoshi didn't invent that stuff in 2009
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:08:14
Weird how cheap and easy running a node in the UK is but only 305 exist in the whole place: 
@_date: 2015-09-15 00:22:00
Listen man, I make more than 15 dollars an hour but I'm not going to pay 15 dollars for a taco at taco bell just because of that. Just because someone has enough resources that they COULD do a thing doesn't mean the thing justifies taking up all those resources. We already have less nodes almost every day at 1mb. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 14:03:31
The whole claim the network effect drives the value idea really puts people in a bad position on explaining how the price has dropped so much in the last two years. Bitcoin had about 1 million users in the mtgox days, now the price is 20% as high. Makes people choose either the network effect being a total lie and not effecting bitcoin's price the way they claim or else bitcoin having fallen in users massively. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 14:33:05
This is the sort of post that is based on the idea satoshi invented hashes and encryption and so on in 2009 which is not the case. A blockchain doesn't add anything. Even if you wanted a distributed thing the block chain part wouldn't add anything. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 21:07:12
I'm sure you wouldn't, just like every other time bitcoin people demand this or that random thing advertise bitcoin because they would totally 4real donate to the cause then actually turn out to donate barely anything.

Your theory about bill gates and so on sort of falls apart since they aren't getting paid in a currency where 90% of it that could ever exist got handed out in the first 10 years. All the money bill gates owns is just a few hours worth of the inflation of the world economy. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 00:48:02
Okay, so what would they be running to the grocery store with in bitcoin land? Like would just using a different currency solve everything and the actual economic problems would be fine and the people and the grocery store would both have functionally no issues at all? 
@_date: 2015-10-21 02:15:49
Those look like graphs where something barely decreased but the scale on the graph makes the extremes at the top and bottom of the scale so it looks like a huge drop.

Did you forget how much more bitcoin used to be worth in the old days?

Let me guess, this prediction will never be mocked the way the guy saying it would be 10 dollars is even though that guy was closer than this guy will be.

It's weird how our culture has managed to adopt a billion other technologies no problem and yet every answer why people don't adopt bitcoin is always "people can't handle new things!" instead of ever actually looking at any issue or problem bitcoin has. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:40:35
do you get all freaked out when bitcoin people use financial words wrong? Like how everyone says "market cap" about a thing that clearly wouldn't have such a thing?
