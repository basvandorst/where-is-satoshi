Personally, I have no interest in what someone does with their bitcoin after I send it to them. The supplier would be best motivated to not convert to local currency if there were other people in the supply chain that were also accepting bitcoin. It's also worthy to note that the price going higher and higher over time is not necessarily desirable if we're trying to make the case that this is a currency one can rely upon for industry and trade.

In the area of securities trading, he is absolutely wrong. Looking at it from a purely moral standpoint, insider trading is committing fraud against someone based on a differential in access to information from a centralized entity (ie a corporation).

Insider trading of securities of publicly-traded companies that do not follow a company's insider trading program and SEC regulations is illegal. Just to be specific here.
Insiders at Coinbase did something highly unethical, however. Without legal regulations in place, companies like Coinbase need to work much harder to avoid perceptions of market manipulation. In fact, this is why Charlie Lee (Litecoin founder) is being lauded for getting rid of his Litecoins. He is "regulating" himself to avoid any perception of manipulation and to avoid damaging the reputation of Litecoin.

Answered my own question:
Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for 
other property? 
A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency 
exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable 
gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less 
than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other 
Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, 
such as whether a loss is deductible.

The value-add is that Bloomberg keeps all the data together in a ready-to-download fashion right into Excel. We do weekly snapshots of the entire universe of ~650 US-based closed-end funds, and capture about 20 different data points on each fund every week. That process takes a minute for a junior analyst to accomplish, using a 10-year old template I made when I was a peon.
We've looked into other data providers, but so far Bloomberg wins the cost-benefit race.

Exactly. The market has provided us with fee-less ATM solutions for well over a decade. My bank covers $8/month. Given that everyone has the opportunity to do business with banks like ours, I can only assume that if you are paying ATM fees it is because you deliberately want to pay them.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:57:11
Let me add some relevancy then. When I was in training and then working at a bank in the late 1990s, the message was already out back then that consumer banking is a barely-profitable nuisance, and that banks really want to focus on commercial business. If you're old enough to remember, this is why you started seeing a big push for online banking, ATMs, and accounts where you're charged for using a teller instead of an ATM. Since everything is moving online and banks almost function like webmail providers to many people, they're (accidentally) paving the way for alternative forms of currency and payment.

This guy is right on, and I don't know why he's being downvoted. I crafted a message to Amazon yesterday regarding Bitcoin. My/our desire to spend bitcoin is a given, so the *only* thing you should be convincing them on is how they would benefit. [Permalink to my post is here.]( I think it is a very simple drum we could all beat for Amazon. And here's the copypaste:
Hello, I would like to voice my support for Amazon adding the option to allow me to pay via Bitcoin. I believe Bitcoin is currently at a place in its history where things like email, the Web, and MP3 files were in the mid-to-late 1990s. To me, it would only make sense that Amazon be on the forefront of fostering such a technology. There are 2 advantages I can see in Amazon utilizing Bitcoin:
1. Reduced payment processing fees; ie, cost savings can be used as a buffer against future increases in Amazon Prime membership fees.
2. Bitcoin transactions do not allow for chargebacks like credit cards do. Therefore, the reputation of the retailer is of utmost concern. Clearly, Amazon has established itself as a trustworthy retailer.

My personal take is that consumers are going to be "lovingly dragged" into bitcoin by commerce.
The consumer side of banking is fluff, and most banks would rather not deal with them. The real business is with commercial accounts. Right now, the banking system sits between every stage of the manufacturing process and skims something off the top at every step. That's worse than being a middleman, it's being a gatekeeper on enterprise.
I think what will happen first is that bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) will become a B2B currency that can bypass the banking system. Eventually, fiat will get pushed further and further out to the edge of the supply chain, to consumers. At some point, businesses will make it more worthwhile for consumers to stick with "their" currency instead of fiat.

For those of you not in the financial world, Damodaran is one of the leading academics for corporate finance and equity valuation. His opinion carries a lot of weight. One of my partners emailed this to me and I was thrilled to ready this article! It's a good, balanced summary of Bitcoin.
tl;dr - 
1. He disagrees with Warren Buffet and various economists and thinks it is a currency since people believe it has value. It cannot be valued, but it can be priced relative to other currencies.
2. A computer algorithm can be more trustworthy than central bankers.
3. Security is still an issue. A commenter on his blog later noted that paper wallets should be used.
4. He has no particular advice on its current price and whether or not to buy. He also says the same thing for other currencies, though.
5. To gain wider acceptance, there will need to be a middle ground between the ideals of Bitcoin and practical applications for commerce (and security).

To play devil's advocate, it would seem that a centralized monopoly on violence has some advantages. One, it pushes back against decentralized violence. Two, it can be steered by a vigilant (ie, educated) society. Three, it democratizes violence...ie, your stronger offense should not be used to take away my rights because I have a weaker defense.
My personal opinion is that the "if you don't pay them they'll throw you in jail" argument is the product of immature boys with a Lord of the Flies mentality. Over 150,000 years, humanity has moved away from free-for-all scenarios and huddled up into things like towns and states, and countries because there are advantages to having a shared infrastructure. All told, it's stable and allows for intellectual development instead of focusing on survival. In the marketplace of ideas, the concept of a "state" won, but that's not to say it is perfect.

It's not a computer, it's an information platform that runs on a quasi X-window mainframe/command line system. Our system is just a Dell desktop, but the keyboard is color-coded for different shortcuts. You can have as many real or virtual screens as you want. We have 2 physical screens and 4 virtual on ours.
You're paying for a highly-curated, researched, cross-linked system of financial data from around the world that is gathered in one place. And the data can be linked into customized Excel models. Our firm uses maybe 5 features out of thousands, but the value and time savings is enormous. The terminal pays for itself in basically no time at all.

I would steer away from the words "electronic" or "virtual" for 2 reasons: 1) Every modern currency is electronic or virtual in some way; so no new information would be conveyed during your 7 minutes. 2) These terms will make Bitcoin seem less "real" than other currencies, although all modern currencies are effectively electronic and virtual, no one really wants to acknowledge it.

Exactly. This system is literally how customer service center employees get screwed over. Your "efficiency" is measured by how long you're on the telephone engaging customers. However, there is often a lot of "paperwork" that you need to get done. The problem is that you can't get your paperwork done at the same time you're talking to customers. And, they're not going to pay you extra to come in early or work late to get the paperwork done. So, you get two choices:
1. Come in early or work late with no pay.
2. Get the paperwork done, but chip away at your efficiency stats, which reduces any hope for bonus pay.

Hello, I would like to voice my support for Amazon adding the option to allow me to pay via Bitcoin. I believe Bitcoin is currently at a place in its history where things like email, the Web, and MP3 files were in the mid-to-late 1990s. To me, it would only make sense that Amazon be on the forefront of fostering such a technology. There are 2 advantages I can see in Amazon utilizing Bitcoin:
1. Reduced payment processing fees; ie, cost savings can be used as a buffer against future increases in Amazon Prime membership fees.
2. Bitcoin transactions do not allow for chargebacks like credit cards do. Therefore, the reputation of the retailer is of utmost concern. Clearly, Amazon has established itself as a trustworthy retailer.

I first felt this way in 1995 when I managed to configure a PPP dialup connection to my college and was actually able to see graphics on web pages.

I own the money in a 401(k), and I can take it with me. The funds are there in an account for me. Pensions are incredibly risky in that they're widely underfunded and I have no say in how they're invested. Your 401(k) trustees have a fiduciary duty to give you a range of investment options. If you're investing in the long-term, an aberration in the market will not put a major dent in your plans, since your asset classes switch from equity to fixed income when you get closer to retirement.

A lot of idiots seem to completely disregard that we live in a nation with laws and property rights. That ignorance is really the biggest gripe I have with this sub. Yes, you own your coins in Coinbase. All property rights are a civil concept. Just like you own your car when you use valet parking, or take your suit to the dry cleaner, or hold stocks at your brokerage. 
That said, a very valid criticism of Robinhood is that you can only buy and sell crypto on their platform for speculation, not for saving offline. I happen to like storing my crypto offline with redundant backups because I have the wherewithal to do so (not everyone does). And I like to actually spend it on goods and services.

That's the thing. They don't own a thing. They lease office buildings and sub-lease out small office spaces, which is not a new idea. The scam is that their founder owns a lot of the properties they lease from at possibly sweetheart rates. It's a huge conflict of interest because he's essentially offloading all of the risk onto WeWork investors.
The fact that no one called them out on their bullshit in a major way until just recently gives you an idea about the level of corruption in the private equity markets.
Anecdote: We considered leasing space from WeWork and nope'd right out of it. There's little to no privacy and we deal with highly confidential information. I can't imagine the number of NDA's that are getting blown in WeWork spaces every day.

They absolutely can be. Bob's Red Mill is probably the most famous one. Depending upon the business and the financial shape of the business, a company can be owned by its employees. There is no "one size fits all" way to do an ESOP.
Your "employer" is always going to be the company, even if you're the owner. That is Business 101 that gets taught in high school. And, ESOPs are governed by ERISA regulations to protect employees; so you're going to see terms like defined contribution employee benefit. You're arguing about semantics.

I've been preparing qualified appraisals of charitable gifts of bitcoin and a couple other cryptos for a couple years now that are designed to meet Adequate Disclosure requirements under Section 301.6501(c)-1(f)(3), (4) and (5). These are donations that go into the hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars. My numbers are used on the Form 8283.
I was skeptical at first when clients approached me because you can pull up the pricing and do it yourself, but I guess they really want to pay for something that meets adequate disclosure. I've come up with a method that I believe to be in line with IRS Notice 2014-21 - IRS Virtual Currency Guidance.
In your opinion, is an independent appraisal overkill?

You only spend the after-tax amount. 
Start with the price you want to buy and gross-up for taxes. Using a 15% capital gains tax rate, if you sell X bitcoins, you can spend X*(1-0.15). Or, if you have a certain amount in mind you want to spend, it's X/(1-0.15).
