your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.  
Even if Coinbase were to fail as a business, the funds held in the custodial bank accounts could not be claimed by Coinbase or its creditors. The funds held in those accounts would be returnable to Coinbase’s customers.
