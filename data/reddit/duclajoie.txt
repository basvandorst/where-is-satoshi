In the view of such non upgraded node, is a transaction from a segwit address to a non-segwit address considered valid or not ?

Ok, I get the idea. Is it based on existing laws / past judgments, or speculation?
How justice would then distinguish what makes up or not a "fork" that coinbase would be required to support to avoid litigation?
Anybody can fork the bitcoin repo, change a few bits in the protocol past a certain block number and spin a node with this program, this would imply infinite amount of integration work from coinbase. It does not sound reasonable, so what could be the distinction between real and fake forks?

How do you do that ?

Nice !  Thanks for the reply.

Right... What I meant is that for mixers, as for exchanges, multiple outgoing transfers come from the an address agregating amounts from very different origins, so most coins don't have a unique "past".

Something i dont quite get from this debate :  why keeping the complete book of transactions and not just only a "reliable" snapshot of utxo database (= btc available per used address)+ only recent blocks since then ? 
I get it that dowloading utxo db snapshot means trusting a third party, but with signed hashs it should be posible to check its validity from multiple sources, and in the end it looks less bad than trusting your wallet/node binary provider no ?

By "wallet/node binary providers" I meant the dev teams, source code hosting serviced, app stores... Except for the very few who write de wallet or node software themselves or those who review the complete source code before compiling and running wallets or nodes, everybody else is trusting someone.
Making it easy to run a node is nice. Using TBs of disk space or spending days dowloading the complete transaction history is a no-go for most people. Having the possibility to bootstrap a node from a snapshot would be interesting in that matter.
The block size debate could then focus on transmission delay and bandwidth usage I guess...

I agree with you, but I was answering to this:


My answer is: there is a meaningful way only under certain circumstances, most of the times  not fulfilled, for example if your coin has passed through a mixer or exchange address.
Your answer is something like "goverments know - they are cooperating with exchanges". :)

Wrong. Bitcoins (or satoshis) don't have a specific identity, it's just an amount that can be transfered from one adress to another. So unless you always transfer to addressed with a zero balance or move the total balance of an address there is no clear history for a given satoshi.  Proof :  mixers.

Thechnically they don't have an identity, but statistical analysis of bitcoin address usage can allow to guess ownership and historical activity of a user. But it's limited to specific scenarii.
For example, Bob and Joe send 1 bitcoin each to the same address X, and later a bitcoin is sent from this address X to another address Y. What is the history of this bitcoin sent to Y ? It's neither Bob nor Joe's bitcoin, you can't pin this coin to a single history, it's somehow both.
In the end all 21M coins could be inheriting from the "pizza transaction".
