Without answers to  wait until 1 hour has passed and see if coins arrived.

So basically same thing as satoshi dice, just different format.
Running a lottery of any kind legally really depends on where you live.
Then, if you're talking about powerball style lottery, you have to get people to trust the number selection. This is difficult and is why many lotteries still use the manual rolling ball machine today (very hard to cheat).

That kind of sucks because I feel like this would take their developers under an hour to do. Im a laymen when it comes to an development and design but have done a little of it and I don't see it being too complicated...

Yea but, so what if he deleted the servers? Likely Rackspace has physical back ups too. What did deleting the servers do? Just fuck with them?
@_date: 2012-05-30 03:27:19
What does this mean?
@_date: 2012-08-10 17:50:09
I sincerely hope this is sarcasm

If you send me 10 BTC i'll send you back 500 in 6 months. No promises or guarantees. Just trust me.

Ballin! What's that, like $14 total?
@_date: 2012-05-31 01:01:20
Makes sense. Cocky little fuck eh

Is what people say when they find out their neighbour is a murderer or rapist.

I don't think it worked due to NSF in my account.
YO, BITCOIN BOT BRO:

I will send more if I can get this to work

Neat, thanks very much for taking the time to explain. One more question: how many hashes / sec could a high end CPU do vs high end GPU vs ASIC?
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:51:44
+tip $2 verify
Sorry I can't do more, but I love RES. If I was a millionaire I'd give you many thousands.

Where is the server / website hosted? What are the regulatory implications of this? I'm always curious if these Bitcoin "casino's" will eventually be shut down and making the owners responsible for thousands of dollars in fines.
I can't find any concrete data on the rules / regulations for bitcoing gambling...
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:35:03
Very much so

Gold and commodities, yes. Stock/shares are the claim to a companies cash flows, so there is actual value there.
Gold is the best analogue though.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:49:45
Good point. However silver is a better conductor and copper is more practical for most applications.
@_date: 2013-02-04 02:21:03
Wow. thanks

Who has credit cards with transaction fees? I pay $0 a year in fees and spend thousands on my Visa. 
@_date: 2013-02-04 00:35:15
And ASICS have more processors?
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:50:31
Ideally it would be a RES app that pulls Reddit content. Like Alian Blue _ RES. WOW

Many Americans are very passionate about firearm ownership. People in general don't like having less of something. So when people interpret Obama's views on more stringent controls for gun sales as "taking guns away" they get a bit edgy. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:27:39
Yes, this is the master plan...
@_date: 2013-02-04 00:13:18
So why are GPU's better than CPU's? I thought it was purely about processing power?
@_date: 2013-10-25 12:34:53
You also pay them if you use cash then. Or use bitcoins on a website that also takes credit card.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:25:38
As I said below, then you also pay this fee if you pay with cash or bitcoins on a website that also takes CC. So the statement "When compared to bitcoin, yes; when compared to credit cards, no." is false, because in both scenarios the consumer is paying the same built in fee.
Unless you're buying on a bitcoin only website and the owner of the website has decided to pass the transaction fee discount on to you instead of pricing similar to competitors and pocketing it.
@_date: 2013-02-04 00:07:27
Sorry for being ignorant, but what's ASICS mining and why is it better than GPU's? more hashes / sec? How?
