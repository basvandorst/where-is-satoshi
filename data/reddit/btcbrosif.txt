This is a response from CEXIO on their Facebook, "we are a trading platform, and watching already sent and accelerating external transactions is not that we should put our workforce to. We do everything that is indeed required from us, we instantly send out all required crypto transactions, and that is where our business area stops."

And why are CEXIO's prices 10% higher than most other exchanges. What a clown I am for using them, never again.

Is that still possible if I'm not the only one included in the transfer? I may represent 1/3 of the BTC sent. Seems like they lump a few of us poor chaps together, rape us on the fees and send us on our merry way.

Hmm seems like many people are having trouble withdrawing on CEXIO at the moment and stuck transfers. Looks like they stopped taking new users on as well.

Soso BTC accelerator offers a low priority package of $27 for confirmation in 17-24 hours. I would be pretty happy with this if it worked. Anyone have experience using them?

Shouldn't CEXIO be using higher fees? I havent had any transfer issues on sites like GDAX. Seems irresponsible for them to send out transfers that won't go through. They should know better as a former mining company.

The quote I got from via BTC was about $2k which is half of my transfer.

The transaction that is stuck is using about 60 sat/B which I believe is too low to get picked up in the current mem pool. Tried to use some of the free accelerator services and paid Toxigon $8 but just seems like they rebroadcasted the link and no confirmations yet.

Like many of you waiting out stuck transactions, many of the BTC transaction accelerator services are very expensive or a sham. This one seems to have reasonable prices but have never used any of them.
