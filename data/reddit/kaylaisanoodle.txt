I tried signing up with AirBitz first before CoinBase and it wouldn't validate the last 4 digits of my SSN. I emailed you guys (great response time by the way) and a representative emailed back asking for my full SSN to verify, which I was reluctant to release as opposed to the last four digits.

They won't verify my SSN to buy bitcoin

Coinbase didn't ask for my SSN, their verification process was fairly easy except for one minor hiccup that was straightened out. Now it just won't make any activity happen when I try to purchase BTC even after it says confirmed. So I guess I have to look for another competent and secure Bitcoin exchange.

And you've validated your payment method already too? 
Yeah there customer service is horrible, I've emailed them a few days ago and no response :(

I honestly don't know how to do anything  BTC related and it's been sooo hard to get things going with Airbitz and CoinBase :/ I'll have to look up Poloniex!

I don't know I'm sorry. I'd say just to keep bothering them via email and see what happens

Not selling, but buying.
 I'm trying to get started with BTC and signed up for CoinBase and have only run into problems so far. Everything is verified and it says I bought BTC but then no activity shows in my wallet, vault, bank account or recent activity feed. 
Is this similar to your selling trouble?
