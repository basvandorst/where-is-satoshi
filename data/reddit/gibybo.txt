US checking accounts have a 10% reserve requirement. Savings accounts have 0%. However, the reserve requirement is irrelevant to how they create money. Whether they reserve 0% or 10%, they are still creating money by loaning it out. There is no other way that commercial banks create money.
When you borrow money from a bank, they actually give the you the money. The amount of money they have decreases by the amount they give you. You could read up on fractional reserve banking and the money supply ( to get a better idea of how money is counted and created.

There is a [known algorithm]( that allows a quantum computer to solve a sha256 hash in 2^128 steps. Classical computers require 2^256 steps (as far as we know).
If a practical quantum computer capable of running Grover's algorithm is built, it would be able to mine essentially all of the 2016 blocks leading to the next difficulty adjustment in less than a minute. Of course they could choose to be a little more subtle and only solve a certain percentage of them so that the difficulty doesn't skyrocket and no one catches on.

Banks do not create money by just conjuring it out of thin air (or by editing numbers in a computer database like many seem to think).
Someone deposits $100 into the bank. The bank then loans out $90 to another customer. That customer then deposits that $90 into the bank. Now the bank has $100 in currency but accounts worth $190. That is how banks create money: by loaning it out. If they loan out money, they have created money in exactly the same  way as every other (non-central) bank does. If they are not allowed to do that, then they are not allowed to loan money

That still creates money and is a fractional reserve. Let's say the bank makes $100 from fees. It loans out all $100 to Alice. The bank owns a loan worth $100 (with a fractional 0% reserve), and Alice has $100 cash. The M1/M2 money supply has now doubled to $200.

37% over 5 years is 6.5%/year. In general, you're right, that's a respectable return assuming he wasn't taking on too much risk. However, in this particular case it's pretty horrible if we assume his 401k was invested in the stock market (which is a reasonable assumption since most are).
Over the last 5 years, the stock market has had an incredibly strong bull run, averaging 15.8%/year (for the 500 stocks in the S&amp;P 500). Over 5 years, that's a difference of 110% vs 37%. He should have made roughly 3 times more than he did.

If you are implementing salt correctly, an attacker cannot generate a rainbow table whether he knows the salt or not. Salts should be long, randomly generated strings unique to each user. If you have a secret site wide salt, you're doing it wrong. The reduction from all valid password strings to all valid hash results is not significant. A 512 bit hash is not going to be guessed with all the energy in the universe and thermodynamically perfect computers filling it.

My understanding was that you could put quite a few layers on a Blu-ray disc. IIRC, the PlayStation 4 is able to read 16 layer Blu-ray discs, with a capacity of 320 GB. Current 4k movies from Sony's online distribution system are about 50 GB, so there's plenty of room. Admittedly that's a pretty high compression factor, but once the firmware is updated and new Bluray players come out, I would expect to see ~200-300 GB 4K Blu-rays, no new format required.

Yea, the issue here isn't really sending the password in cleartext on login. It was HTTPS, so it wasn't really cleartext anyway. The real problem is that it was a GET request instead of a POST (or at least, it had the password as a CGI parameter) so browsers, servers, etc store it in their logs.

Well, generally the thing to do when your currency is being devalued and you want to preserve your savings is to buy lots of different things. Buy some gold, some silver, bonds, stocks, euros, dollars, etc.

When referring to passwords being in clear text or cipher text, it means over the wire or in storage. Not what your computer can see. Of course your computer can see the clear text password, you typed it in! Even websites that do it correctly send it in "clear text" in the HTTPS request. It may be an issue for people looking over your shoulder, but I already explained that when I talked about GET vs POST.
I'm not sure where the implication is that they were storing the passwords in plaintext. They may have been, but using it in the URL is not at all an indication of that.

There are indeed restrictions on the number of transfers you can make from a savings account. I'm not sure where exactly it comes from (the fed/fdic/whatever), but savings accounts and checking accounts have their own regulations.
Banks must keep at least 10% of a checking account's balance on deposit with the central bank. They don't have to keep any amount of a saving account's balance on deposit with the central bank. In exchange, they must not allow more than 3 transfers per month from a savings account.

In the US (not the UK): Any income you receive in Bitcoin creates a tax liability at the time you receive it as if you had been paid the equivalent in USD. If you purchase something with Bitcoin or sell Bitcoin for another currency, the difference between the price of Bitcoin when you received it as income and the price of Bitcoin when you purchased something or sold it is counted as a capital gain or loss.
The UK is probably somewhat similar, and obviously your accountant will have no problem explaining the actual rules to you. They don't have to know anything about Bitcoin. It should be treated the same as any other non-GBP compensation. If he doesn't know what Bitcoin is, you'll just tell him you received an asset worth £X as compensation for a service, then you traded/sold that £X for £Y at a later date. This is all assuming you wanted to follow the law and not attempt to avoid reporting income/gains that they don't know about.

QC cannot break the sort of hashing/symmetric encryption that pass phrases protect. They can use Grover's algorithm to make it a bit easier, but it's unlikely that will matter as long as the pass phrase isn't really short.
Grover's algorithm would allow a QC to break a 24 word pass phrase in the same number of operations as a classical computer would take to break a 12 word pass phrase. The general rule is that it can reduce the number of words in half, but 24 -&gt; 12 is still not breakable. 12 -&gt; 6 could be worrisome depending on how many operations the QC can perform per unit time.

It's my estimate based on the advertised rates of the best commercially available ASIC miners (50 cents/GH) and the current difficulty. It does not include the energy used to create the hardware which is a good point, but it probably does not change the number too much. I would feel pretty confident guessing that it wouldn't change the estimate by more than 20%. I suspect after including the energy cost of the hardware and the margin that my 50 cents/GH could be off, my 4 MWh estimate could be off by 50-100%, but the comparison ends up still being roughly correct (at current market valuations, the energy from barrels of oil at the spot price is much more than the energy required to produce the equivalent dollar value in mined bitcoins).

I am afraid you hold a common misconception about fractional reserve banking. The reserve requirement is the ratio of reserve to deposits, not loans (see  "In the United States, a reserve requirement (or liquidity ratio) is a minimum value, set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of the ratio of required reserves to some category of deposits held at depository institutions").
Banks do not loan out currency that they don't have, that's impossible. The federal reserve can create more currency, but they still have to create it before they can loan it out. What you are almost certainly thinking of is the M1-M3 supply, which banks can create by loaning out currency (see  for definitions).
If a bank takes in a deposit for $1, they can only loan out $1. However, if it's in a US checking account, federal regulations say that they can actually only loan out ~90 cents. Hence the 10% reserve requirement. This means that for every $1 in deposits, they must hold 10 cents in currency (I believe the currency has to be held by the central bank, but it's not particularly important). While they have essentially created 90 cents in M1 (since the total M1 supply is now $1 deposit + 90 cents loan, or $1.90), they have not created currency - there is still only $1 in physical paper/coins. Technically the person that received the 90 cents could deposit that to the same bank, thus allowing the bank to loan it out again (81 cents this time), but that would create a new 90 cent deposit, giving the bank a total of $1.90 in deposits. Since the bank has a 10% reserve requirement, they would need to hold 19 cents in reserve currency for those deposits, so they would only be able to loan out a total of $1.81.
A bank with a 100% reserve requirement would not be able to make any loans, since they would need to keep currency equivalent to 100% of all deposits.

Probably, but it's also one of the main things they are working to fix right now. Currently transaction fees are set by wallet developers and periodically updated in new versions. When the price of Bitcoin increases over a short period of time, the wallets still have the old fee (priced in Bitcoins) and it takes awhile to update. Soon, clients will adjust more intelligently based on market demands, which should drop the price considerably.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:57:27
You sound like you don't really understand how markets or finance works. Shorting would work the same it does with any other asset: you borrow some from someone who has some, sell it, and promise to pay it back with interest. Fractional reserve/full reserve is completely irrelevant. You can loan Bitcoins just like you can loan anything else. Doing so necessitates a fractional (or zero) reserve.

Generally yes, the ETF would be backed by actual Bitcoins. You would be able to exchange shares in the ETF for Bitcoins (and the other way around) directly with the fund operator, assuming you meet some minimum transaction amount (which is generally pretty high, so the Bitcoin market cap needs to be high enough to make this profitable with institutional arbitragers). If you operate below that transaction amount, you would trade the shares on the public market.
This is how equity/gold/silver/etc ETFs work. However, they can also do more sophisticated ETFs that short Bitcoin, or use leverage to buy a multiple, etc.

Almost every limitation of the interface between traditional currency and Bitcoin is a limitation of the traditional system, not that of Bitcoin. To understand the full benefits of Bitcoin, you have to consider an environment in which everyone is using it.
Think of it like email vs fax. When everyone was using fax, email wasn't particularly useful. You might dismiss email by saying something like 'well if I have to just print it out to fax it to someone who doesn't accept email, what's the point of using email in the first place'. Of course, you would really be talking about the limitations of the fax system, not email.
So instead imagine a world in which your income was in Bitcoin, and everything you bought was in Bitcoin. That world would have a lot of nice properties that we don't have with physical currency (like the ones I mentioned above).
It's true we don't live in that world (yet), so the benefits are currently pretty limited, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. For people that already have Bitcoin (of which there are many), it is already much easier to buy things in Bitcoin than in any other way. Many of these people got their Bitcoins by trading someone for cash in person, or did work and got paid in Bitcoin, so they never needed a bank account.
Replacing a lost wallet works differently depending on what sort of wallet you are using. A common practice is to use a wallet that syncs between various devices. Unlike cash, the same Bitcoin can exist simultaneously in many places at once. If you lose a copy of it, you just restore it from somewhere else (with nearly no delay or cost). You can also have a third party host your wallet for you, in which case recovering it would be pretty similar to recovering a lost bank card (but it has many of the same drawbacks).

Electrum generates private keys using an algorithm that, given a seed, will always produce the same set of numbers when it is run. The 12 word seed it shows is really just a 128 bit number (expressed as words to make it easier for humans to remember).
One such generator function would be to just increment the number by 1 each time (I'm not sure if Electrum does something more complex). So if you had a seed of 2836581, you would just keep generating private keys from 2836581, 2836582, 2836583, etc. Since you can always recreate all possible private keys from that seed, it is also always possible to recreate all addresses in the wallet from that seed.

You are using the wrong term. By definition a 100% reserve bank must have reserves equal to deposits, so it cannot loan any money out. Further, loaning money out necessarily inflates the money supply. You cannot have a bank that loans money without inflating the money supply (or at least, I can't think of a way). I highly suggest (re)reading through 


This is just not true. A lot of people mistakenly believe this about fractional reserve banking, but banks don't create money by setting values in an account without actual deposits to back it up. They cannot loan out money greater than the total value of deposits. They aren't magic, they are just banks.


I don't see how. You claim that a $1 deposit allows them to loan out $10. I claim that it allows them to loan out 90 cents. There is a pretty big difference. One requires magic, the other doesn't.

I think most would-be competitors are afraid of the legal status of operating an exchange.
MtGox is actually a really poor exchange. We know a lot about how to run these exchanges from hundreds of years operating stock/currency exchanges, and MtGox has learned very few of the lessons that modern day markets have learned.
How to crush MtGox:
* Offer easy deposits/withdrawals for Americans (they won't be anonymous, but it won't matter). Coinbase does this well, just copy them.
* Trading fees need to exist only for market orders (and they need to be very low. &lt;0.1%)
* You must offer liquidity rebates to traders who place limit orders (i.e. pay them 75% of the transaction fee paid by the person placing the market order)
* You need a fast API, and transactions should be settled in a well connected data center located in the north eastern part of the U.S. (your API needs to respond to wall street's algorithmic traders in 5-20ms)
* Since you will not be getting a lot of money from transaction fees, you can sell seats to the exchange as an annual fee. Brokerages will buy the seats then resell trading services to their clients.
You will have sub-penny spreads and 10x the trade volume/liquidity of MtGox. I'd do it myself if I wasn't afraid of going to jail over it :/
Bitfloor may actually be on its way to beating MtGox. Their current marketing is holding them back though, IMO.

I don't know, it depends on how many possible made up words there are (and assumes you chose from them with equal probability).
The math is pretty simple though: log([# of possible choices]^([number of choices used]))/log(2).
So if we assume 1000 possible words, and you use 5 of them, then you get: log(1000^(5))/log(2). Google will solve this equation for you:

ECDSA being broken would only allow you to break wallets that reuse addresses. By default, the popular clients only use an address once.
SHA256 is not going to be broken with an O(0) time algorithm (which would be required for infinite speed mining). The most likely scenario is that an attacker finds a vulnerability that reduces the search space from 256 bits to slightly fewer bits. A large enough vulnerability would provide the opportunity for a cheap 51% attack, but the damage they can do with that is limited and the incentive is not necessarily there.

The primary advantage over cash for physical transactions is that you can carry lots of it without your wallet being bulky, and you can protect it in such a way that it is not easily stolen or lost.
The advantage of it over a debit card are that you don't need a bank account, you don't have to worry about someone using your card number to buy things (or the merchant charging you more than they should), and it costs much less for the merchant (cards typically cost a few % of the tx).

Well, I just tried to transfer one of my domains to Namecheap using Bitcoin, but their implementation leaves a lot to be desired.
I filled in my domain, got to the checkout page, and it gave me three options: Pay from 'Funds', 'Credit Card', or 'Paypal'. Turns out in order to pay with Bitcoin, you have to first add 'Funds' to your account. So I click the link to do that, it asks me how much I want to add (I don't know, aren't you supposed to tell me how much I owe?). Anyway, I follow a few pages and finally end up on BitPay's page where it asks me to send a specific number of Bitcoins to their address, so I do. The page recognizes immediately when I have sent the funds, and redirects me back to Namecheap.
Great, now I can find my way back to the checkout page and finally finish the transfer! Except I can't. Despite having sent the funds, they won't show up in my account for another hour (or possibly up to 24 hours). I understand they want to prevent double spend attacks, but this is absurd. We're talking about a $10 domain that they can just revoke if the payment doesn't clear. They have to wait 45+ days for paypal/credit cards to clear, but they give the product to me immediately, and I don't have to go through their ridiculous fund adding process to do so.
I applaud the effort Namecheap and I'm happy to see Bitcoin becoming more useful, but this needs work.

Backing up your private key(s) is equivalent to backing up your wallet. His point was just to be careful when you spend coins from that address. If you have 100 BTC on an address that you have backed up, then spend 1 BTC, you won't have 99 left on the address you backed up, you'll have 0. So you must be careful to backup any change addresses generated/used when making a transaction.
Most wallets pregenerate a fixed amount of change addresses, so backing them up gives you some leeway in making transactions without invalidating the backups, but if you only backup the key for the current address you lose that ability.

bitistamp.net/account/ is literally just an html page that opens the real bitstamp.net in an iframe. When you visit bitistamp.net/account you are seeing the real bitstamp.net. 100% real. Clicking login does not change that. You can login to your real bitstamp account, really be logged in, and the phishing site won't get it (there are some caveats, so don't actually do this).
Here's the trick: After 60 seconds, the site swaps the real bitstamp.net with the phishing site which is just a login page. You will notice that your account ID disappears and is replaced with the standard 'LOGIN OPEN AN ACCOUNT' text. The current market price also disappears. Now you are on the phishing site and anything you enter will be sent to the phishers and you're screwed.

The 'race' to setup a wallet, import a private key, and send a transaction to themselves is accomplished by software in a tiny fraction of a second. There is no challenge there, at least not for long.

*this neglects the fact that there is more than 1 bitcoin address with money on it, but the odds are right for happening upon a particular address.

This was pretty much my point from the beginning. The vertical in the video is only apparent due to the scale he chose. You could have chosen any number of smaller scales that would have shown the vertical at an earlier point. This is exactly what Bitcoin charts do (which is why Bitcoin always look like it has gone vertical (except for the periods where it is not growing expoentially), even in 2010).
I didn't say it looked the same, I said the right side would always look vertical (in the quasi-vertical sense of the video), and the left side always flat (again in the quasi-flat sense). You wouldn't zoom a graph in only one axis, you would just see a flat line on the bottom. The implicit assumption here is that you always zoom it to fill the area (i.e. the top right of the curve is in the top right corner, and the bottom left of the line is in the bottom left corner).

log(1.6e21)/log(2) = 70.4 bits of entropy.
The xkcd example assumes a much simpler dictionary of only 2,000 common words, which gives you:
log(2000^4 )/log(2) ~= 44 bits of entropy.
The xkcd comic is not dumb, it is talking about knowing the dictionary and trying each word (not each character).

100% of the gain is taxed in the US. If you are in a high tax bracket and in a state with a moderate to high income tax, and you hold the Bitcoins for less than a year, you will indeed have to give about 50% of your profit to the state and federal government.

For 15 years in web security, this is a pretty amateurish approach to password security.
JavaScript encryption is not very useful mostly because if the connection isn't over SSL, the attacker can just change the javascript (encryptPass = function(a) { return a; }). If it is over SSL, it's already encrypted. It also doesn't prevent replay attacks, so an attacker will still be able to login as that user with passive logs of non-SSL traffic.
SHA256 is also not an ideal choice for a hash function. If your database is compromised, pretty much all passwords of dictionary words + basic variations and all passwords &lt; 9 characters will be compromised with relatively little computing power. We have ASICs that can do 60 billion SHA 256 hashes per second. You should be using scrypt/bcrypt/pbkdf2.

I'm a little confused about the 1.3 difficulty. According to  that would imply an average hash rate of ~9 MH/s. A typical CPU during that time would do 10 MH/s by itself. Running a 10 MH/s miner at difficulty 1.3 for a day would net you ~7700 coins (and you would cause the difficulty to double after 2016 blocks).

I heard BFL has 75k chips coming at 4.5 GH/s each, so ~300 TH/s. That would increase the difficulty factor to something like 40 million. Avalon also has ~50 TH/s coming, so let's say a difficulty of ~50 million when all of these pre orders ship. You can also expect it to increase steadily after that as they make more, lower their prices, and make improvements to the chip designs over time.
Most capital investments take many years to pay for themselves (stocks tend to average 10 years, solar panels/windmills 5-20 years, treasury bonds 20 years, etc). A capital investment that has the potential to pay for itself within a month implies a very high level of risk (both that it won't pay for itself at all, and that it may produce very little beyond that point).

Although addresses are generated from a 256 bit private key, they are hashed with RIPEMD-160, so there are actually only 2^160 possible bitcoin addresses.

To give a $100 loan, they must actually have $100. They don't put a 100 in a computer database and say it's money. The fractional reserve requirement comes from the idea that they must retain some % of deposits. If they have a $100 deposit, they may only loan out $90 of it (if it's a 10% reserve requirement). If they loan out all $100, it's 0 reserve. To have 100% reserve, they wouldn't be able to loan out any.

I don't know why there are so many upvotes going to people claiming his logic is wrong and so many downvotes going to him supporting his logic.
His logic is correct and is pretty similar to the [Pigeonhole Principle]( in math.
He is not talking about averages, he's talking about the maximum coins possibly needed to have more than 99% of the US (315 million people) or the world (7 billion people). This is assuming the worst case scenario of wealth distribution in which the 1% hold 100% of the wealth. If they only hold 50%, then you need 50% of 6.7 or 0.3. Regardless of the distribution, 6.7 or 0.3 guarantees you at least 1% status.
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:41:54
I do have one nit though: The 1% in mainstream media is usually referring to wealth rather than physical currency. With the use of bank deposits denominated in BTC, it is possible have a M1/M2 money supply of BTC &gt; 21 million. Your argument is still technically correct, it's just that no one would use this method if Bitcoin were to become mainstream.

It wasn't an exclusive distinction, I was just avoiding making a claim on PPS pools with fees because I wasn't sure about the general case. Certainly a PPS pool with a 100% fee would never go broke, so it's not entirely true in the general case. Is it guaranteed that a PPS pool with 99% eventually goes bankrupt? Maybe, but it's not clear to me that it is the case.

Well, if you generated bitcoin addresses at the rate of 10 trillion per second, it is likely to take thousands of years on average to find an address that matches any other address.
To find one that actually had money on it would take many orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe.

It depends on what you mean by hand out the money. When MtGox isn't lagging, selling bitcoins for dollars takes a tiny fraction of a second. If you mean transfer to your bank account, then a few days. But you aren't vulnerable to the exchange rate changing during that time - it's already in dollars so its value won't change while it is being transferred to your bank account (and it only takes time because your bank takes time, not the exchange).

It is (theoretically) possible to send a transaction that never gets confirmed, yes. The details are a little rough around the edges since Bitcoin's scalability is an area of active development, but you would probably just want to resend the transaction with a higher fee. Technically coins that aren't in a block yet still belong to you, so they are never lost in this process.

I really don't know, both are gambles. Holding them is 100% tied to the exchange rate, buying mining hardware is tied to a combination of the exchange rate and supply of mining harsware.

But your "(hash of the)" inclusion is the key to the whole thing. Public keys in Bitcoin-land are generally not public until you spend coins from an address (and when you do spend coins from an address, most clients send the remainder to a new address). You can't find the public key from the hash without also breaking ripemd, hence the point of this thread.

The sum of three 6 sided dice does not have an even distribution. In fact, it's pretty uneven.
The probability of rolling a 1 or 2 is 0%. The probability of getting 3 is 0.463%, and the probability of getting 11 is 12.5%.
For a 16 sided die, the probability of rolling a 1 is 6.25%, 3 is 6.25%, 11 is 6.25%, etc.

This is a great explanation of exponential growth, but I have a minor nit.
His talk of the 'vertical' phase is misleading. An interesting property of exponential growth curves is that no matter what timeframe you look at, the left side is always flat and the right side is always vertical. You can zoom in on the flat part and you will yet again see that actually the right side is vertical, and the left side is flat.
The vertical he talks about is the 'last' vertical, which can only be determined in hindsight.

According to wikipedia, the milky way galaxy is roughly 0.3 kpc thick and 34 kpc in diameter. That gives it a volume of pi * 17^2 * 0.3 = 272.376 cubic kpc, or ~8e60 cubic meters.
A grain of flour varies a lot, but 10 cubic micrometers seems to be a typical value. That's 10^18 per cubic meter. So we're at about 8e78 grains of flour in the milky way.
There are 2^160 possible bitcoin addresses, so 2^160 / 8e78 is ~1.83e-31 milky ways full of flour sized bitcoin addresses. Said another way, it would take 1.83 * 10^31 grains of flour per bitcoin address to fill the milky way galaxy.
Well shit, did I mess up somewhere?
EDIT: Maybe you are thinking of a bitcoin address as 33 bytes (264 bits) since that's how many characters it has in base58encode form? But in reality there are only 160 bits in a valid address due to the hash + version + checksum + encode.
