I think it will hit 100k. but I dont know if i would say within 2 years. what makes you feel that way
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:55:34
do it

I dunno, it means more than nothing. It gives precedence for recent prices. When I hear something was both 13k and 3k in the same year that tells me that within the past year, nobody can agree on a reasonable price range for the thing in question. And as an investor that would make me a little hesitant to buy, at least until recent price movements settle into a tighter range.

If you think Bitcoin is just "some japanese guy's math project" well I have a handful of shitcoins you might be interested in too

Can you find the site from where you got the support number?
Also, I've not used Mycelium wallet but does it not require a password to begin a transaction? Most bitcoin and bitcoin-style wallets require you to supply your password to sign an outgoing transaction. Did you send the person your password, or your priv/pub keyset? I feel like I'm missing something here.
Since this is reddit most people are probably going to take pride in shitting on you for this. I'm amazed you were willing to post your story. Sorry for your loss :(

people selling lol
imho ppl selling right now are rightfully very nervous about the worth of a BTC and with the wide price swings thru the past year nobody has any reasonable idea what they are worth beyond what it costs to mine. And at least for now the market is rejecting higher BTC prices despite mining costs.
I can't blame them. With all the news about possible price manipulation via tradebots and the tether fiasco it really muddies the water when trying to determine fair market value.

much as I would love BTC to succeed and continue to grow in value (and i think it will despite all odds) it does seem like it needs to correct downwards for a while, not upwards. That ridiculous bull run in 2017 appears to have skewed future price movements for at least a few years

Really? Oh shit that's so awesome!

I accidentally sent some BTC to scammers myself back in 2012. Happens to more people than you would think
nobody deserves that shit. pick yourself up, get your hustle on and put this behind you. only way to go is forward

One of the signs of a knowledgeable speculator/investor like this person is someone who acknowledges the shortcomings of their own information and places their bets accordingly.
Everything they say is true. Skim profits, hedge your bets, don't convince yourself the piss you're getting hit by is rain. There is a proportional relationship between the rapid increase in price of an asset (particularly bitcoin) and the amount of people who suddenly think they are financial Nostradamii because they nailed a 30+% increase on a speculative asset.
Remember that most everyone is here because they wish to increase their net worth, not because they have secret valuable knowledge to share. Treat their statements accordingly!
2017 was a lucky year having collected from 3k to 8k and sold  This year's moves were smaller, collecting most around 4.5-6k and letting it go  I'd rather sell early than sell late especially given my altered risk acceptance level this year. When compared to the average annualized returns of more mainstream assets like bonds and market funds, selling early in the midst of a burgeoning bubbleup is totally acceptable for me.
Keep spreading the good word of rational speculating buddy.

who cares why. prices are just now getting to buy territory. im with you, buying every chance i get. We probably have a year or two max before buying opportunities dry up

The internet is a beautiful place and never ceases to make fun of itself

I understand your reasoning but I have a difficult time seeing this occur. Especially when there exist so many businesses and ecosystems within the crypto asset space than can leverage different assets as risk to attempt building their business. I.E. If the price drops below a certain level, institutions like Gemini will open a line of credit and scoop up as much as they can afford.
Now, how low is that price? Hard to say. But your prediction is a max $0.99x17.4mln would be a total BTC cap of 17.22mln. That would be easy credit for a highly risk tolerant company to access if they wanted to buy the whole ecosystem.
Just how I see it

lifting shit from WSB for karma. Is this how low we have fallen
