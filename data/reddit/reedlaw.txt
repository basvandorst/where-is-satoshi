Do you have a guide or wiki on how to do this manually? I read the README on github but couldn't figure out exactly what's going on.

I think there is a misunderstanding here about open source. By all means, don't trust random websites to encode secure data. But you *can* go check out [ download the source code, read it, and only then, if you feel it's safe, execute it locally on an air-gapped machine. Of course you should also understand how brainwallets work and all of their potential pitfalls. If you think brainwallet.org is dangerous, submit a pull request on Github with any modifications you think will make the dangers more aparent.

This is not an official announcement from PBOC, it's from just one bank: China Merchants Bank.

That's like asking what's the difference between McDonald's coffee and coffee in Italy. Dark chocolate tastes bitter if you don't appreciate the complex flavors, just like coffee tastes bitter to some people. Some poor quality chocolate or coffee may taste very bitter but I've had Rogue Chocolatier Chocolate and it was anything but bitter. Definitely the best I've ever tried.

"Effective immediately, in conjunction with this release, trading will be halted, all order books cleared, and trading re-enabled."
Any idea when trading will be re-enabled?

Miners who don't have to pay for their electricity will keep mining. Others will have to look for equipment with better Gh/s to watt ratios.

Where can you buy coins below bitpay's rate? Currently Coinbase is almost $4 higher. Mt.Gox is more than $10 higher. BTC China is $20 higher. BTC-e is...oh I see :)
It's $16 cheaper. So now the question is: what's the easiest/cheapest way to get dollars into BTC-e?

Please elaborate. What was too expensive? It seems to me the only expenses are transportation and time.
