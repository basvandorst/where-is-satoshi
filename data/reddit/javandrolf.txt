For some reason we have something called "ebay classifieds (kijiji)". Seems like it may have once been kijiji but ebay bought them?

Depends on if you like Stefan's viewpoint on things. Personally it sits well with me and I think most of his points are correct.

I wonder if they still have that claw foot tub.

I've bought at all price-points since buying at the top. 
I've made much worse investments.

Unless he actually engaged in DDoS. That's not a developer being helpful, that's racketeering and cannot be allowed in the legitimate business operations of bitcoin.

For reference these are the federal contribution limits: 
Looks like $2,600 "per person each election cycle".

At least by then I can convert it to 1 BTC

Normally I do, sorry. Deleted and everyone can just live with the one that broke the rules.

They touch on the fact that they can't really accept donations in bitcoin because the limit is $100 "per person each election cycle". 
Their own regulations are limiting them. Derp.

Yep, I think it's the most important "pillar", the others will work themselves out as long as user adoption continues just like any technology continues to grow and improve as more users validate it. 
Our society is increasingly more social and connected, so for every new Bitcoin user a new set of potential users is connected socially through that new user and may have a new and/or more positive opinion of Bitcoin. As this userbase-web spreads, Bitcoin is strengthened and becomes more attractive to new users. See Facebook, Reddit, Apple, Android etc. Things are attractive because others have them and have positive experiences with them. 
I think of it like any new disruptive technology, someone has to be a lunatic by the past culture's standards and try it out. If enough people try it out, then others will start to question the past culture's standards and adopt as well. At some point it reaches a tipping point were the past culture's standards appear to be the lunatic pov and the new "disruptive" technology, by hindsight, seems to have always been the best answer.
I guess you can say that Bitcoin has kind of a socially recursive function built in for building it's user base. As long as the recursive part continues to be generally positive, it will win.

I think it's like reddit. If we didn't all show up for reddit and post and vote, it wouldn't be a very strong system. But we did all show up to reddit and post and vote, so everyone else decided they would also show up to reddit and post and vote.

Another wonderful day in Bitcoin. No matter what the price is, let's not forget the new friends we've made and the excitement of supporting technology that can change the world.

Take this video with a grain of salt. They clearly have a reporter bias here and want to share a negative aspect about bitcoin, as this fits the agenda of CNN Money and studio backers. The general viewership for this clip will continue to feel at ease with their lives not being disrupted by "crazy useless Bitcoin".
Bitcoin isn't meant to be lived off of yet like cash or credit cards, we all should know this. The internet wasn't meant for streaming YouTube and batteries weren't meant to power cars. However, innovators will build on technologies whenever and wherever they can. 
I wouldn't go out and make a video about how an 8 pack of AAA batteries won't make a Tesla go down the street, but they thought it was good reporting to show this...

Very cool site, and great job pushing to follow your dream. I remember seeing a similar site idea here:
Was there any inspiration from that?
