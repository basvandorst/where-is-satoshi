it says "unspent".  There are 2 outputs.  And still the address that I sent to is not the correct address.  Is it ok/safe to post the TXID here?  I don't know how to read this shiznit.

how would I find out the recipient and how do I contact them?  Thanks by the way

Ok sorry I misunderstood. I copied and pasted the original address, and a few more and pasted them in a note and they stayed the same.  I do know him well and trust him so I don't think he would say he didn't receive it if he did.

do you mean the original one I pasted?  I don't have access to it anymore.

Is it possible that I sent it to myself?
I searched the TXID details and it says "previous output address" and that address is listed in my "input" for that transaction, and that address ALSO is my receiving address.  So what does that mean?
Also, in the transaction history of my wallet the amount appears as a (-) and is in red.

Is there a way to contact the owner of the wallet it went to?  is it possible that I was phished?  This was the first time setting up this new wallet on electrum. Feel so dumb

yea I searched the one he gave it has 0 transactions.  not sure how the transaction I sent went to 2 outputs.  And don't know how to find out who owns them.

any advice?  I see of the 2 outputs, one of them is one of my change addresses.  The other one, the coin is still unspent and the address has no other transaction history.  Not sure how to find out who owns the address.  I asked the vendor again to check if that address is linked to his wallet at all.

Does "unspent" mean no one has claimed them?  It is still unspent.  Do they just sit there forever if no one claims them?  is there anyway to get them back or contact the owner of the wallet?  thanks

in electrum, when I look at my "addresses", there are a bunch that say "receiving"  then a bunch that say "change".  One of the "change" addresses is actually one of the output addresses of where the funds have gone.  And the balance of that address is the current balance of my wallet.  Is it possible that I accidentally sent to myself?  Weird that the other output address is not in my addresses though.  Can I post the TXID here?

when I search history and open the transaction, it says "2 outputs created" and the BTC is split up to those output addresses, neither of which are the original address I sent to.  I searched each and it looks like this transaction is the only one for either.  It has 104 confirmations but both say "unspent".
