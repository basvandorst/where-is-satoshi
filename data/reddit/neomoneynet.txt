I think it's a war now. The government is obsolete.

Better yet. If some SMART dude stole them back and RETURNED them to the users.
Your option pays the government for their thievery

     I have to speculate to answer the question.  The bank never explained it to me very well, but I did call in and follow their menu to ask questions about a specific transaction.  The guy I talked to was very helpful.  He agreed with what my main branch originally told me:  transfers to a business account were not possible.  Mine was a business account, but the guy I was talking to said "it looks like a transfer.  Let me look into it more."  A few minutes later, he explained: "There is one way that a transfer can be made to a business account, but it requires the owner of the source account to be present in a branch."
    So there was no fraudulent paper instrument, and the claim that it was a transfer was true after all.  Another mistake on the part of BofA, but in the end, they made me whole.
    Ok, so you should always make sure you know who it is that will deposit money to your account (whether it's a transfer or not) because it could be the victim of a scammer.  When they find someone trusting enough, they will offer to sell them something of value, and all they have to do is "deposit to my account: [Your Name and Account info Here]."  This way, the victim feels safe because they know to whom they are giving their money.  When the victim finally realizes that his method of contacting the seller no longer works, they (try) to find the seller (who they think is you) another way.
