Yep, someone tipped me .005 BTC 4 years ago on a different account and it was still sitting in a wallet. That $4.99 is now $90 and moved to a different address. Thank you so much for that comment. Now I'm wondering if I have any other outstanding tips laying around.

It's as much as a fraud as stocks. What you need to do is get a life or find or a hobby. Plenty of people dislike things. I for instance dislike religion but I don't go around posting anti religious shit all day and spending my free time posting on religious forums.
Your spam is pretty annoying and dumb.

Why are you posting this same comment in multiple threads?

Trolling on the internet is a pretty unhealthy and childish hobby for a 33 year old.

As someone who sells on Amazon, I would love to take Bitcoin as payment. It would benefit me greatly. Having more people selling on Amazon also benefits Amazon. More payment options benefits them in general. I can see a couple ways that it would benefit them.

You are trolling though, spamming the comment section of the cryptocurrency subreddits with the same copy pasted comments.
Your points aren't valid they are just wild speculation.
