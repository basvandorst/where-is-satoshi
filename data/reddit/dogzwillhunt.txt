Yeah, maybe he’ll just pop it just like one of those lil marinated mushrooms.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:44:14
If your a long term investor. Just buy and hold. The central banks are scared and doing the typical Government knee jerk reaction. Its a pin prick to the aorta of the banking cartel. Slow bleedout, fear, death then adaptation.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:01:18
Don’t forget about some traders hit with a tax bill. Wouldn’t be surprised if this has a little to do with this slump.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:49:59
Ok trumpski
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:16:24
Relax people! This is just a redistribution. It will go back up. If your a smart investor and didn’t pull out major loans to buy BTC you should just wait. This has happened before. But this time the exchange transactions are mostly made in satoshi’s which imo means big holders are selling and is being redistributed amongst the population. BTC is unstoppable.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:54:25
Hahahaha! Thanks for the laugh! Maybe chopsticks you’d think a man would eat his own dick as a delicacy.

Wash sale rules DO NOT apply to crypto - It is considered property. You can turn around and sell and buy back immediately after without penalization. I've looked this up and studied the laws on that.
On the topic of cost basis regarding airdrops - there are no laws/rules surrounding this. I interpret the rules/code that an airdrop is considered income the day it drops in your wallet and the taxable event occurs when you sell- even if it's at a loss.
If you find an IRS rule or law that states that airdrops have to be claimed as net 0 for tax liability purposes - I am all ears. There are none - and the IRS hasn't made a decision surrounding the airdrop question. Now, I can see them doing this in the near future which would probably mean that I won't be able to carry over those losses for 2019 tax yr.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:48:16
No- I paid for them before the fork. My cost basis was the amount when it was accessible in my wallet. I sold them at a loss.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:35:39
I suspect they’ll pass a ruling and I won’t be able to do it again for next year- but if they don’t Ill continue filing the same way. Ill keep track and maintain a savings acct with the money in case there’s some shenanigans.
@_date: 2019-07-27 04:17:34
Very true:  rule in crypto- ALWAYS THINK TAX FORWARD.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:37:51
There are NO IRS rules on forked coins having a cost basis of 0. They haven’t made the decision on the time of filing and it is very much an unaddressed subject.
I paid for the coins before the split. Therefore, the cost basis would be the value of the coin when it was deposited into my wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:27:50
We do and we still worry. why? because the tax laws surrounding crypto are extremely complicated.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:02:40
BTC is considered property- a lot of rules don’t apply as its not considered a security. For example- wash sales don’t apply to BTC. It’s the laws that Congress passed ����‍♂️
My point is- even though BTC is traded like a stock would be- some of those rules do not apply as mentioned above.
My thoughts are that Congress and the IRS has had plenty of time to come up with a better regulatory environment regarding BTC and crypto. It is not my fault that they bungled it on a last second pass to meet the budget and tax reform deadline. I follow the law and in this case- there are no laws or rules addressing the forked coin issue.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:12:27
If you find an IRS ruling stating what you just said - Ill believe you.
Otherwise, Ill consider the cost basis as what it was when it was deposited into my wallet.
If I owe the IRS then so be it- Because I rolled all the BCH into BTC best part- wash sale rules don’t apply.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:08:21
Ironically the thing I kinda look forward to is McAffee eating his own dick.
@_date: 2019-07-27 03:08:31
Thanks for the affirmation and yes what you’re saying is true. Realized gains happen at the recorded moment of sale. So if you’re using a legit exchange and your coin wasn’t processed until a day or two later for numerous reasons. That is the realized gain-  NOT when you first hit the button and in crypto price can abruptly change in matter of minutes.
I also get what you’re saying that the moment your crypto is accessible to you for various reasons- then THAT is your cost basis NOT any earlier.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:27:44
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:44:35
Funny, I sold all my BCH as a slight loss hehe.  I was thinking tax forward when I did as I wrote them off as a loss.
I know that there are some questions surrounding if I can even sell them at a loss - I've read the tax laws and nothing states that I can't. Because there are no rules surrounding selling airdrops at a loss and claiming that on your taxes. So it'll be interesting to see the response.
Also, I read a lot of dumb comments on other forums about “just playing it safe” and better to “pay more” to keep the IRS off your back. DUMB.
NEVER PAY A PENNY MORE THAN WHAT YOU OWE.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:34:49
Haha- yep! Well, we really didn’t get them for free- we paid for them before the fork. Ill keep you updated if I have to go to bat on this one- I suspect that they’ll pass a new ruling and I won’t be able to carry over my losses on the future. So we’ll see- god knows I can write off losses for the next 10yrs.
@_date: 2018-09-17 19:57:01
Please! I wish this would crash down to 5k and end this FUCKING BEAR MARKET.
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:43:37
Hahaha! Thanks for the clarification! 
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:30:06
Honestly, hopefully everyone liquidates all their BCH instead. The other turd stain.
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:06:17
Damn, the sellers are relentless.
@_date: 2018-09-14 14:50:12
hahahahaha- HA! Oh, the irony! Kinda like the buy/sell wall theory amongst the many other conspiracies that get peddled around here. Oh yes! time to relax...........*not till 12 but still in the green.
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:17:12
Don’t you boys worry. We’ll be chewing the asshole out of 5.8k here soon. ��
@_date: 2018-09-14 15:07:19
I’m not gonna lie- That last cold storage sell kicked in my knee caps. Keeping a steady hand. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:25:23
Just in anticipation of the butthole being chewed out of 5.8k. I’ll go ahead and put some buy orders in at 5.2k.
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:13:08
Here it is ladies and gents. The ghost of Mt Gox - the turd stain of crypto is back to fuck everyone over once more.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:54:22
Thanks for selling low. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:12:27
How about you just go ahead and sell all now. Crash is coming real soon.
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:13:12
I hope you have a nice day too. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:11:51
No, it means that we hit rock bottom and that theres only room for growth.

Yeah, I’d would like to think that the sellers would run out of steam. But they are fucking relentless- 
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:56:21
It appears East Asia isn’t afraid of the Mt. Gox fud.
Funny thing is I bought in after that 1st crash and will be waiting for the next implosion and if it doesn’t happen Ill just wait this ol’ bear out. It’ll end sooner or later for better or worse.
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:37:03
Easy killer. I have a steady hand. Besides, I am not paying 30% capital gains tax on all that BCH I sold when it was up for BTC. So merely its breaking me by watching the price being swindled away by this year long bear market- thats it.
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:49:51
Vitalik deeeeeeez nuts.
@_date: 2018-09-19 13:58:41
well, I have been in this game since 2015 right after the Gox crash. I’m not gonna lie. This market is starting to break me down. I guess we’ll wait and see. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:13:38
......... Wonderful- This bear market has almost killed me off.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:41:18
Soooooo. you’re saying this is from Mt Gox?
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:48:16
Being a pessimist. 8.8k this week.
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:56:10
There’s a good chance that we’ll see a spike after the consensus followed by a massive dump. We will keep seeing spikes and dumps and will not reach 15k until Mt Gox (the giant terd stain) is scrubbed and finally forgotten.
@_date: 2018-05-14 12:43:46
200k. ish
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:01:10
The fight for the anal depths of 9k is back on again. Back to 8.8k and if it breaks that then 8k is easily attainable.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:24:33
200k BTC is a small amount? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:44:11
Of course I’d like to be wrong. But my comment has no influence on the price whatsoever. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:09:26
Back to sub 9k. possibly 8k if it doesn’t hold at 8.8k
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:29:35
Told you guys. As sure as the sun will rise we will see 7.8k. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:11:16
This whole thing is just flat out baffling. I suppose we’ll hit rock bottom at 6.5k ................again.
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:37:14
I sure haven’t sold �� 
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:30:45
8k today - 8k next week- 44k in September...........until they are played out.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:27:39
I am absolutely sure that the Mt Gox trustee does not have ANY interest in the daily discussion. Its a fact that Mt Gox is and will be liquidating. If that reflects the average cost of BTC so be it.
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:46:08
Ok, so what is your point? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:51:28
Ill be damn. We have a real chance of 7k territory again.
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:12:32
Just as I predicted. We will see 7.8k here real soon.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:24:09
What Country are you from again?
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:59:33
yeah, I am happy to be wrong about my prediction.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:12:53
There’s a real good chance that it will settle in at 7.8k
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:24:23
Sure, I don’t like taxes either. With the National deficit at 22t don’t you think that we either pay it down, work 3 jobs to make ends meet- or kick the can down the road continuing to be a slave to society. Either way you cut it - we won’t be a “free” society until we get out of debt.
@_date: 2019-03-28 22:01:41
Yeah,  you probably don’t remember when one persons income was enough to support a Family. What life in America was like before 9/11. When a monthly health insurance premium was 100$ a month, when property was worth buying.  
What its like to not be caught up in social media with a fit of anger to prove a point. You see,  you’ve been had - because you either forgot or you’re to young to remember or never had the chance to experience America before we sold out.
 
@_date: 2018-10-14 20:04:04
I meant the bears and you’re slowly dying. This bear market was a necessary part of adoption. But now you all are played out.
@_date: 2019-03-01 02:49:57
So if you had 1400 in ‘97 wonder what they’d pay you back now? More, less or the same amount?
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:30:30
Maybe a little drop. Bears are played out.
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:57:44

Its a pin prick to the center of the heart. The bears are slowly bleeding out. .........slow death.
@_date: 2018-10-14 15:20:56
I felt like that the other day and it will pass. I’ve made it through Gox and I am not about to give up now. Especially when this fucking bear market could be finally ending at any moment now. Because eventually it will.
@_date: 2018-10-17 03:04:46
blah, blah, blah
@_date: 2018-10-13 00:00:40

mine too bro- mine too.
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:26:37
“ride to 0” Yeah ok. Good luck with that one.
@_date: 2018-10-13 11:25:17
Actually, I invested in 2014. I hold more BTC than all your moms boy toys she fucked over the years.
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:14:18
I suppose waiting on a bull market is like watching a snowflake swim up a stream of snot. I suspect another drop to test 5.8-6. Everyone is super cautious at this point and no catalyst in site.
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:12:47
Also, I might add. BTC is worth 6.2k now! Those people who missed the last bull run are really wishing they bought in at 250, 400, 600, 1000, 1500 and gone. So I'd say we’re in a great spot at the moment for sustainable growth. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:41:49

I know right! I’ve been tempted to jump in. I’m sticking to principles man!!!
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:21:41
Ill agree with you currently. But its a matter of time before the chickens come home to roost. The IMF made a statement about crypto laundering etc. The IMF isn’t on sound financial footing. I find it funny that they can get together and paint a rosy picture but never talk about solving real problems. This is the problem- its a house of cards. We’ll see in due time which securities people run to when the economy gets ran into the ground by overheating of the market, debt and inflation. It might not happen this year, the next  or 5 yrs. but it is going to happen. There is absolutely NO way that the path the world has gone down will end up as a good scenario. I know I sound apocalyptic but the reality is that we cannot sustain printing fiat for trade that really has little to no value. It would take substantial reform to turn the current trajectory around. Which people that live comfortable lives that don’t really care will not tolerate major reform to save everyone’s asses and by the way I pay my taxes on crypto so as far as I am concerned they can try and crush btc and run it underground. But there’s people like me that actually see it as a real security. I do have a red line however and will sell all my crypto if it reaches a certain low to preserve earnings.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:30:59
Yeah, look at the volume on the seller side. There’s less than 4k bitcoins to get back to 10k and yet the beak of death has managed to take down a 10k buyer volume. THERE ARE NO BUYERS.
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:09:50
I was wondering when your stank ass would show up.
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:45:53
Everyone say it in a LOW monotone voice:  
Bitcoin is trending toward 8k. 
........and the upper limit is shrinking.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:36:53
As I said earlier. I wish you the best when it comes time reporting your taxes. I really wish it were as simple as you claim it to be. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:50:04
Guess we’ll see. Its a good thing that I don’t take advice from the *turdbergger. I’m good either way 
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:48:58
Your missing the point. But I wouldn’t expect anything more. Stop comparing gold to bitcoin it’s like comparing analog to digital both are useful one is just more adapted to technology.

�� ClassyCoder developed some Street cred with me.

Can’t wait to start posting: “Never 6k AGAIN”
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:34:51
Call me crazy but my instincts are still bullish. If not Ill make a hard sell at 7800 and wait for 6-6.5k
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:34:33
Do you even know what the word intrinsic means?

@_date: 2018-03-11 03:22:10
Yeah, we’ll see alright. After we get rid of the Mt. Gox terd stain. Then we’ll wait and see what convenient time Brazil will auction off those seized bitcoins. Maybe it’ll happen but that fire sale won’t last very long.

If any of you were around during the first Mt Cox collapse- You’ll understand that this feels just like the same despair and lost hope. The eco-system was WAY more fragile at that time. It will recover. Oh, hell heavy bells. We felt em move.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:08:01
Actually the last I checked it was worth 7865k. Am I delusional or does it have value?
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:07:16

@_date: 2018-03-16 14:18:29
You cannot deduct losses on bitcoin.

You’re killing BTC its meant to be used.
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:16:40
Awwww. Does that make your lil feelings feel good? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:06:58
Thats my strategy its not fact. I said that instead of selling all my assets at 7777 that Ill wait for it to drop to 6-6.5k to put in a buy. Anyways your an emotional lot and I have nothing to glean from you. Your a waste of my time.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:58:11
Man, that guy is a cuck. I Just wish he’d go ahead and rage quit already.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:00:12
we want to crawl back into the bears asshole. Thats why.
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:21:06
Well, if we don’t break out of the wedge today or tomorrow the price is going to go down, down- down.
Important strategy decisions coming up.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:21:53
You have contradicted your own statement. If BTC is for the people then they should have the right to sell, hold or whatever. You’re just pissed because the price isn’t going up fast enough for you, so you pedal the whole “hodl” movement. Let it go. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:48:12
You sure can with bitpay - again take that load of value and buy some gas with it. I am not by all means discrediting gold but crypto has far more potential.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:33:51
I’m glad you sold your holdings. It’s not going to go to 8k. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:07:50
Well at least I have some allies on this schizophrenic commentary.  
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:56:20
Because when big dip happened it dropped to 7208k on Gdax and at that time the 24hr volume was at or about 95k in favor of the sellers. Right now  the 24hr volume is at 17k. Zoom out of the mid market price and you’ll see that volume clearly is in favor of the buyers. Buyers at the time aren’t eager to buy at the moment but are setting the price on the exchanges and are waiting for it to come to them. Sellers are playing out and whats left are the remnants of the Mt Gox terd stain, Government seizures (which are a concern as they’ll auction off at some point) and the bullshit FUD that goes around because these shortsellers are getting rekd and on the 30day chart it looks to me like a inverse head and shoulders pattern. But I never claim to be 100% accurate as I could be wrong its Bitcoin it’s decentralized and it doesn’t give a fuck about me or anyone else 
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:21:57
I’m not against short trading. I find it rather fascinating that a person has the time and grit to do it all day like you do. I’ve got things to do like get away from the damn computer. You fella’s keep doing it up. YOU DO YOU.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:44:00
uh, right here. 6.5k
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:44:53
diversification of the coin itself. If everyone just held then buyers would lose interest. It needs to be traded and diversified to more people. Infrastructure also hasn’t caught up with crypto yet. This is very healthy even though painful for a lot of people.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:08:08
Yeah, I don’t see trading bots as a set and forget trading platform. I do see them however as a useful tool. My strategy is working for me just fine and we will all see where this all takes us. Bots are interesting with the fact that Bitcoin is somewhat a limit commodity with infinite divisions. So the more people like you that use bots, I feel that it will drive the price up in the long run. But lets see how it go’s as we really don’t know what is going to happen. Because two things are VERY certain. People are making money and People are losing money.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:29:21
Sounds just like the Central Bank.
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:13:15
Stay strong! buy/sell/trade/hold. In my opinion people are pulling out to pay taxes and the banking cartel and all the queens people jumped in on the diarrhea faux media train.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:26:18
Brave man, we’ll take your money regardless.
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:00:18
Good try- am I arguing with a 13yo? But it already appears that I’ve gotten myself into a pissing match with a skunk. How about this. you do you. Ill stay in my lane you stay in yours.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:55:47
YES! 6.5k 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:26:53
Alright, I concede. Sorry for giving you so much shit.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:04:35
Good comment.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:36:24
Yeah, because that was the whole premises of my statement. “because I said so” I really didn’t know that I had that much power. It took a leach like yourself to point that out. Thx. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:26:25
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:52:58
Agree, It could go either way at this point. Making absolute predictions is trolling.
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:06:04
30% for short term. 1yr or less
20% long term 1yr or more. 
Thats in the U.S. They kinda fucked crypto when they passed tax reform. Guess they don’t understand it.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:47:37
Is your moms house better than your aunt’s house?
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:02:29
You damn right! Great response.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:12:40
Just pointing out your bullshit. It could go to 12k or it could go to 8k. Why make a statement based on where you feel it should go.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:06:37
Not mad at all and your probably correct when you called it out. I tend to be a bit on the bullish side which can sometimes put me on the bullshit side as well as some other absolute predictions that other’s make. It makes for good discussion though.
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:28:30
  No problems man. Even though I don’t disagree with short trading. I don’t know why they put themselves through it. It’s gotta be rough.
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:34:14
ok rainman
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:37:51
Well, thats the appeal isn’t it? If it didn’t hold value then what good is it and its not a matter of “think” lots of people are making money on it. Trade, sell and buy just don’t get all depressed when the price drops or isn’t going up fast enough for you BTC is decentralized and doesn’t give a fuck about you or anything else.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:03:05
I get a kick out of these post as well. Its like manic/depression world. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:30:27
we’re not going sub 4k bro.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:59:05
Go ahead and invest into gold then. Because the first thing to fall in this house of cards is fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:19:34
Dude, Im trolling you. There is a selloff going right now and all the gloom and doomers come out in full force. Its presenting a buying opportunity for others. A fire sale is around the corner. Maybe here real soon. But don’t get me wrong. If it hits my set trigger point I am selling ALL my holdings.
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:21:43
Really? You haven’t figured out that we’re 20T in debt? That a dime is made out of Cupronickel a worthless metal only symbolic for trade. That the dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the Government which lost its AAA status? You haven’t figured out that the solution is to print more money or that hyperinflation is a step away? really? I can keep going if you’d like me to..
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:40:06
No, we’re not all fucked. This is healthy and exciting for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:10:36
Ok everyone- Its just BTC manic/depression you terds need to go do something. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:44:29
Finally, a great comment. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:06:24
Its almost there now! 6.5k by thursday.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:24:35
Hahaha! �� with all respect I am an American. Tired of searching daily news on Bitcoin and the Guardian pops up with endless stream of misinformation. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:24:43
Where did this shit ticket come from? 
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:20:18
I am with you for the most part as we have very similar paths. I disagree with you on the we still haven’t found the bottom yet. But as you know these are just my thoughts and not predictive certainty. Because you could very well be correct. I am going the other direction because I see more enthusiasm amongst investors and more of them. When you and I were in the game early on we were surprised at how fast it had climbed in so little. My experience’s with Mt Gox  I like everyone else sold and forgot about it. Luckily I started thinking about it when it was at 300 and said fuck it and bought in. As you know at that time there were even more uncertainty that it would just fade away and it very well could have. - but it didn’t and we just held right on through it all. This time I believe it’s different. I think alot of people are waking up to the reality of things like taxes and Governments around the world trying to wrap their arms around it causing much panic amongst the pump and dump institutional investors a recipe for the “bubble” that FUD news likes to latch onto. My gut says that we reached the bottom at 5.8-6 range and the floor is at 9k. Now, that is my thoughts- as one of us will be right as I very well could be wrong. Make no mistake I definitely have a cutoff as to when to sell and not look back. My fear is that these new investors are playing the very short term game and that will lead to your cesspool scenario and that could very well happen. So we’ll see. I am very optimistic as there is more of a foundation, innovation,  interest and less availability than when it was when we were jumping out of the nest. Either way its the life of a bitcoiner we’re up then we’re down. We just have to play it out.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:13:02
That cats gonna come screaming out of its hole. I predict that at 6-6.5k someone will squirt a little turpentine on its asshole and he’ll come out.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:09:04
yeah, Ok. I suspect that you know just exactly where the peak and bottoms are. Would you spare me some of you’re GODLY knowledge. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:22:17
Hahahaha! Ok- Man - I might jump in now. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:21:51
Yeah, I know what intrinsic value is. I paid a fuckload of taxes on my BTC. Sounds like its being treated as property. Fuck off.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:20:36
Point taken. Hang in there! Honestly I believe that we will recover and at this point you might as well just hodl. selling now might not be a good idea. That is only my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:01:10
Bet you have a real true insider source. What did your mom make for dinner?
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:10:05
Yeah, I’m actually think’n that that’s reasonable. Part of me wants to jump in now though.
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:10:07
Im down wit OPP not sure what OP is.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:54:43
Its not the self serving lazy attitude. It is hope that turns to greed then anger when it doesn’t work the way you desire it to. Face it. right now. It has value and people are willing to pay for it and it has potential to be an accepted world commodity or it could go to nothing. But right now its has value. Its basic human emotions that are driving the price in either direction.  
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:15:26
nah man, not at all. At first I came here to offer friendly advice. Now, I either fight or leave some sarcastic bullshit. It’s much more enjoyable that way!
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:11:42
great for you. I wish that were the same here.

Again, why are you here?
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:03:47
Like the dollar bill? Actually, the dollars pretty strong right now. Must be some other form of weak currency.

You’re trending toward irrelevancy.  
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:13:46
IMO you’re locked in. You’ll have to wait for it to go back up. But you should set an absolute bottom line to sell and stick to it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:48:27
more bounce per the ounce.

It's what I was saying earlier. Its manic/depression world. Are we all giddy and happy now? Don't forget to take your pills.
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:33:42
Each person has a unique strategy. But setting yourself up to a winning position for when it either go’s up or down is an ideal position to be in.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:41:38
Ok man, how does bitcoin fail at any use? Gold has been around for thousands of years. Bitcoin a little over 10. If BTC is causing chaos and grief amongst traditional investors in a little over 10yrs- good. The infrastructure hasn’t caught up with the technology- but it will. But, I don’t need to sit here and argue my point vs. your point as I can easily. It doesn’t matter I am not going to change your opinion and you won’t change mine. But I can tell you this. If you hold gold or bitcoin you can exchange it for fiat. It has value. I can’t melt bitcoin down and make a  high end motherboard for mining but I sure can run bitcoin right through one.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:46:28
coherency is a word 2
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:55:29
Actually, its good to see both point of views and let the individual think for themselves. I laugh at people who think that this is not a speculative emotional market. It can go either way and we all know that. Having hard lines saying that it will go one way or another is a foolish game and you will probably lose. Making a point across in an intelligent way even if its against your thought philosophy is welcome. I instantly can tell how emotionally invested a person is when they come out swinging trying to validate their believe of where they WANT the industry to be.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:17:36
Nope, I still feel pretty much like a winner.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:18:21
Really bro? You’re comparing bitcoin to poker chips? How about Casino chips? I suppose they don’t have any intrinsic value either. But you can sell them. Fuck off
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:05:30
I stand corrected 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:01:25
Yeah, Our Orange Ameba wants to build a wall to keep us in. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:55:50
So what- Let them sell. Interesting how you want this forum to become a regulated nanny site. fuck off
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:44:42
It’s the daily manic/depression forum that revolves around the price. Welcome.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:42:45
Like the stock market? Ill take my chances on BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:46:04
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:23:46
Ok, son. I’ve been in this since 2013. I know trends. The January sell-off had over 95k volume in favor of sellers. We have 22k right now on gdax and its the classic pump and dump. Thats fine. Buyers are setting the price and waiting for it to come to them and there’s new buyers jumping in at this price point. It could go either way. But you’re right Ill give you that at the moment it’s trending “toward” 8k. I’m good with that too. But Im bullish and I’m leaning toward that.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:52:17
Prepare your 5-6k buy orders.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:52:55
 Both of you are correct IMO. You gotta know when to hold em and when to fold em.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:46:38
I’ll start in here: You a funny guy. The dollar is NOT backed by gold. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:38:17
Lets see what the other half does tonight. Should be clear direction by tomorrow morning of course you might miss the low buy point for short term. But mid to long term you should be good.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:51:05
What do I think? I think that more than half of you are suffering from digital dementia. There’s more emotional price speculation and conspiracies everyday. Its speculation gone WILD.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:28:09
You guys gonna do a little BMW? Bitch, Moan and Whine? People buy and sell that is what makes bitcoin useful.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:52:28
You realize that the price per coin has absolutely everything to do with a persons desire to sell it right? Im going skiing because its a powder day. You guys have fun sitting behind your computers fighting for your point of view. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:45:07
Yep, if it kisses 8.3k Im out. Ill leave the cesspool to whoever is hodling.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:44:47
leach: to purge soluble matter out of something sometimes confused with leech. A leech can be a parasite. A parasite can suck the mental occupancy out of a person that gets caught up into the bullshit. So I’ll move on and stop trying to leach the leech.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:01:07
Bro, bitpay is a visa card that can be associated with a digital wallet. I have gotten over it- I own gold too. How about ruby’s, platinum, silver, diamonds, aqua marine, garnets, fossils, meteorite’s. They have a store of value as well.

Oh, I know how capital gains work and it’s a little more than basic math. But go ahead and do what you want. I’ll continue to wait it out and see what happens and in all fairness I’ll credit you with the fact that I don’t how much he bought or sold. That part is true- but I have not seen any big market buys the last 3 days and I’ve been following closely because I have a lot at stake and am believing in the tech. What’s selling now is not big buys but small buys and bigger sells that’s starting to slow. We might see it go to 4-5k. Depends on how many want to short sell. You should not respond by calling people retarded but get your point across in a more intelligent way.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:09:58
Then why are they throwing such a fit? Why are Government’s around the WORLD concerned about bitcoins success as a storage of value and why is there so much negativity around investing in BTC. They are concerned and are trying to convince the public that putting lipstick on a pig is a responsible thing to do. Meanwhile, its ramming its face right up crypto’s ass.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:05:07
That’s a great response. For me it’s hard to navigate where its going to go. Im betting that its going to change the World.
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:43:34
Yeah, lots of whining. Instead of lambo’s maybe some BMW’s (Bitch, Moan, Whine) and great comment. I find it exciting myself. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:30:42
Your comment makes absolutely no since to my reply. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:01:11
true. depending on your Country. Here in America people are making hay on speculation. Mark me, most will get burned on taxes. So that in itself will eventually limit day speculation.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:10:59
I believe that it’ll possibly hit 6k maybe a tad under at 5.8k but 6.5k is more realistic. We’re reaching oversold undervalued territory. We will see a bull run soon and hopefully a more sustainable organic rise instead of speculative frenzy that caused this to happen in the first place. Bitcoin is here to stay. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:02:15
I git it man. hahahaha!
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:26:53
Yeah, Ok- I’ve been in it since 2013. But I digress. You should just focus on doing you as each persons strategy is different.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:28:18
I wonder at what point you’ll be wiping your ass with a hundred dollar bill. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:26:15
daily discussion- I can’t quit you.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:25:55
Well, this market is dogshit. If you see it for what it is, why hang on to a bag of dogshit?
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:30:49
I know! It sucks real bad! It’s considered a long term gain after 1yr and then it drops to 20%. So at first I didn’t sell because I didn’t want to pay the fuckers 30%. I guess thats why I never became a day trader.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:17:57
They don’t OWE you shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:34:09
Yeah and you fuckers need to get off gdax off the couch and ride your bike. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:36:18
❤️ I luv you goldbooger
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:27:36
If you’re short selling and are trying to predict where this market will go then good luck. If you’re long and you want to escape the 30% capital gains tax then anywhere between 6k-9k is a good bet to buy. I am long on BTC and I believe that the market has plenty of room to grow from here.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:23:32
6.5k Thats where Im at. waiting wanting wanting waiting.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:02:56
Silly about what? I am dying to know. I didn’t make a bet and I simply stated that it wouldn’t break below 9.8 or somewhere near the area. I am not losing anything at all. Either your ill informed or failed to read the rest of the post. Either way - I can justify my point by letting you know that it stayed above 9.8 during the time I predicted it to be. But go ahead- tell me how I was wrong because it’s at 9.6 arena now. Its ok Im a big boy. You see I’ve been around this bitcoin thing for awhile now I’ve survived Mt. Gox and I will surely survive irrelevant comments.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:32:25
Its pretty much recognized anywhere in the World. It is limited and its the first. It’ll always have its place. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:59:02
Unless you sell at a loss- you have to pay on any profit. 30% short term 20% long term (more than a year)
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:14:25
yeah, whatever bro. goodluck.
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:10:04
master of the obvious. This is a long term investment.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:11:33
Yeah, well we’ll see. There’s a new wave of sellers running out the door and I can’t wait till these fuckers sell everything they hold. They’re relentless. I fully expect prices to be driven down once more. Like I said on an earlier post never underestimate fear of the masses that just LOVE to sell for less than they invested in. *trigger: PANIC
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:21:53
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:15:24
I’m bullish. But I never make absolute’s. Its a weird time for BTC as it could go either way or it could just flatten out and ride the 8.9-9.4k for a while as that has happened before. My opinion is that buyers are setting the price and waiting for it to come to them. While the sellers haven’t played out yet. It is my opinion there would have to be an outside driving force to drive it to 8k such as the Mt Gox selloff. (terd stain) I survived the first one and Ill survive this one.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:12:19
Just another daily discussion Manic/depressive day! Too much discussion is bad for you people and me too
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:42:19
YES! Thank you! I was a little overzealous when I stated 5-6k buy. But realistically it could make a move to 7.5k. “could”. I don’t want to freak out the emotional chart watchers. If it does drop then Ill buy. If not Ill continue to hang on to my earnings. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:16:45
Ok fucker, I actually like you.
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:57:36
well you better just go ahead and sell then.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:55:05
What we’re seeing is the banking sector fight back. They’re big, they’re powerful and they are scared of the potential for crypto. But its a matter of time as they are putting lipstick on a pig that is inevitably ramming its head right up the ass of decentralization.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:47:25
I guess this has become the hard line for me.  I’ll wait and see what happens and then sell everything at 7k- or buy in with what I sold at 14k? I’m leaning more and more to selling it all.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:44:38
Ive been sounding the alarm on this for awhile and the answer I always get is that the taxes are simple. I’ve been through this myself. Its the difference between holding for longer than a year or selling to keep your earnings. Its a tough spot.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:37:16
So you’re saying people should sell if they need the money? Why not let it be? If bitcoin gives power to the people, then why are you pissed people want to day trade? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:11:01
You’re funny. I have a stop limit to where I sell my whole lot with 50% plus profit. I also mid trade. If it go’s up or down Im still winning.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:50:15
I’m a god-damn barracuda I hold my own. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:06:10
I am considering leaving this forum. Some of you know what you’re talking about. Most of you react on some false idea that you think or want to think is the truth. DON’T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU THINK!
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:09:07
......and it’s becoming a cesspool 
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:49:52
I can agree. We should definitely consider the fact that this is a real possibility.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:58:22
because after you pay transaction fees and that 30% capital gains tax. You’re left with hardly no meat on the bone. Then you get greedy and escalate the risk vs. reward and get caught. Everyone that sold at 9.5 are hoping it goes to 8k. It isn’t.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:11:57
The field where you putt the rough at. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:47:11
What time is the rapture happening?
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:36:47
Your talking about the dollar right? Maybe you can go and buy some war bonds?

I’m a believer!
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:54:25
Thats all you got? You would like me to prove to you on reddit! hahaha! I don’t need to prove anything especially to you. So I guess we’re at what we call a stale mate. Ok �� you win.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:15:27
You don’t know bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:05:56

@_date: 2018-02-21 21:25:23
we’ll see. What amazes me is where the hell do these fuckers come from? Its like they swarm together and sell all at once. I just wish these short traders would just take their profits and go. Another buy opportunity hopefully will never come to them. We might touch 9 -9.5k but it isn’t going any lower than that I guess tonight we’ll see what happens.

It doesn’t really matter when a person invested when it was 200-400$ per BTC now does it? So fuck off.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:38:32
Yep- and it’s a turning point right now. Keep a close eye on the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500. It’s at a crossroads as well. My bets on BTC.

Back into the butthole of the 9k’s we go.
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:28:15
Lots going on. I suspect that with a new trade war looming and the stock market crashing that BTC will serve as a safe haven for some investors. Im actually sort of bullish but am definitely prepared for a drop.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:49:56

I have a base of profit - if it grows that equals more profit and I set a new base point regarding the new earnings. If it falls to my set trigger low point I sell the whole lot still holding a profit. Mid term trading/long term is my strategy and it requires patience to get there. Its not instant gratification/sorrow that a person gets from day trading. But more of a longer term strategy.

yeah, it is kind of a cesspool right now. I get that. But crypto has what gold doesn’t and that is a chance to become a form of everyday transaction as well as a store of value. Unless we go back to the gold standard but that went out the window when fiat was implemented. We don’t use lady liberty silver dollars for everyday transactions now do we? A dime has less a value every time a dollar is printed off. Cupronickel is a dime and not 90%cu anymore. But they sure did fool us because it still looks like SILVER.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:30:43
don’t you worry, I got myself a fat cache and Ill hold them until I want to cash out. I also sold some at 14k and waiting to buy when it drops again. Don’t you worry. Im doing real good.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:23:33
It depends, In my case I invested early on and had holdings for more than a year @ around 20% taxable gain. Any purchase that is bought and sold within a year of purchase is considered short term @ around +/-30% taxable gain. IRS looks at it as 1st in 1st out when buying/selling and recorded gains as such.

I used to laugh at predictions like this one. But I’ve watched a 3-4k seller volume take down a 10k buyer volume. Fundamentally, if theres not a fresh start to the market. Then 5k is truly a real possibility.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:51:35
Its healthy because. Its liquidating and diversifying to more people. Just because it drops from where people bought in at doesn’t mean that it has a chance to be accepted by more people. Look, Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. It might lose value but it isn’t going away. Its a good thing that more people can afford and use bitcoin. Thats how it will survive.

Very funny. I am a 40yo man. I invested into BTC in 2013. Bought in when it was 200-400$. Ive made lots of money.

Hodling is NOT a good strategy short selling is also risky. But in order to solve the big price swings and become stable there has to be balance. Which means selling/holding are the yin and yang of healthy trade.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:57:38
Like it always does? As in it almost hit 12k last week and retreated to 9.8k. It hasn’t hit 12k on the way up since before the big dip. I read the daily commentary for some good laughs thats about it.

Sucks dude. I bought in before the 1st Mt Gox shitstorm. After a long while it came back up- I sold. Then bought more when it fell again. My advice is to set an absolute bottom sell point and if it doesn’t get there wait and see what happens.

No worries man. It’s speculation. I knew that we’d be kissing 6.5k here real soon. People don’t like hearing that. But I had a feeling that that was reality. But I didn’t over and over express my point. Because I admit that I can be wrong too. It just doesn’t help when there’s a one sided point of view that keeps getting expressed over and over.
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:42:14
We all shouldn’t forget that the tax man came a knockin. I took a hit and I am sure others did too. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:44:05
Well, thats interesting. So the OP ask for advice and there are two different suggestions. Each one is trying to validate his/her opinion and all parties are trying to justify their point of view. The OP has a choice- follow the point of view that satisfies his/her desires which in return they will defend to justify their position. (That is why we fight on this commentary).  In reality the OP should be suggested about the point that BTC is decentralized and that its holders have a responsibility to do whatever they want with it. Now, that creates a big problem because its then purely based on emotion. The emotion being that you either want it to go up because of your position of where you bought or you want it to go down because of the position you sold. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:41:48
What makes me say that? I’ve been around Bitcoin before Gox collapsed and I’ve kept track of trends. Just because you buy in and lose a little money in the short term is not a reason to panic - unless your a short seller. Thats fine if you have the stomach for it. But most of those fuckers are getting burned. Don’t be reactionary on this thread. But build it and become a LION.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:21:51
Maybe - Maybe Not. Don’t fool yourselves either and keep it real. Even though I firmly believe the future is bright for BTC and that we will see more stable footing. There is always a plan for if this thing does in the rare occurrence go’s to true shit. Always have a plan to leave with a profit for the worse case scenario.

So the fact about risk assessment’s is that they are subjective even more so that there isn’t a baseline yet. I understand how these are put together and while they can present some truths they usually take more than one written by different assessor’s to pull out the common formalities to make it somewhat accurate. FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:48:52
The opposite of a bull trap is a bear trap. People are still losing money because they are cashing out and banking on it to dip back to 6k. Very unlikely. You can’t predict what BTC is going to do.

bleh, bleh, bleh. gloom and doom. “stay out of bitcoin everyone” invest in stocks. yaddy ya. When you buy stocks do you ever see and hold the stock? Its based on the need for the company and what people believe in it is it not? Tesla wouldn’t be worth diddly squat if people didn’t believe in it but it is and it’s changing the World. Bitcoin is the pioneer of digital currency and its already changed the world has it not? Will it hold 1st place- maybe -maybe not. It is a store of value, you can trade it and people are willing to buy into it and its worldwide. People are paying to much to the peak and saying �� and hoping and praying that it will go back up so they can recoup their money. Then they look at the exchange every second and freak out thinking its going to tank again. Theres the other half that are waiting for it to drop to buy in. Being that there is a limited quantity and that theres an interest worldwide to keep it alive. How can it fail? BTC will likely succeed in the long term. HODL or sell are both equally important and open your eyes because its worth 10k right now and people are waking up to the fact that it is here to stay and are willing to take a chance to invest in it. The getting rich overnight days are over but the long term looks bright.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:52:55
At what price did you buy in at? Seems like your running a tight profit margin considering the transaction fees and taxes you have to pay. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:08:51
I sure hate to be the dickhead here. But I just did my taxes and paid a chunk that came from directly right out of and around the butthole region plus 8in of colon. So now I have to poop in a bag. So you fuckers that are short selling better keep in mind that they'll come for you. Sooner or later and I don't think that you can report losses. Have fun!

I understand volume. But does the text book bear flag account for limited quantity? If there’s no sellers then how can it go down? The positive news here is that the most of the big holders sold off. More people are investing into the ecosystem albeit buying smaller quantities. But I guess there’s big fish out there that’ll deploy loads of coin and drive it downward real fast.

A verb, from the Latin verbum meaning word, is a word that in syntax conveys an action, an occurrence, or a state of being. In the usual description of English, the basic form, with or without the particle to, is the infinitive.

So whats your point? I find it a little creepy that you spend so much time and energy to prove your point and revel in your glory. By the way Bitcoin is not going away.

@_date: 2018-02-27 04:41:39
I am with you for the most part as we have very similar paths. I disagree with you on the we still haven’t found the bottom yet. But as you know these are just my thoughts and not predictive certainty. Because you could very well be correct. I am going the other direction because I see more enthusiasm amongst investors and more of them. When you and I were in the game early on we were surprised at how fast it had climbed in so little. My experience’s with Mt Gox  I like everyone else sold and forgot about it. Luckily I started thinking about it when it was at 300 and said fuck it and bought in. As you know at that time there were even more uncertainty that it would just fade away and it very well could have. - but it didn’t and we just held right on through it all. This time I believe it’s different. I think alot of people are waking up to the reality of things like taxes and Governments around the world trying to wrap their arms around it causing much panic amongst the pump and dump institutional investors a recipe for the “bubble” that FUD news likes to latch onto. My gut says that we reached the bottom at 5.8-6 range and the floor is at 9k. Now, that is my thoughts- as one of us will be right as I very well could be wrong. Make no mistake I definitely have a cutoff as to when to sell and not look back. My fear is that these new investors are playing the very short term game and that will lead to your cesspool scenario and that could very well happen. So we’ll see. I am very optimistic as there is more of a foundation, innovation,  interest and less availability than when it was when we were jumping out of the nest. Either way its the life of a bitcoiner we’re up then we’re down. We just have to play it out.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:54:14
Ok, I’ve been thinking about this: This sell-off is good people who bought in at 6-7k and are making a profit. PLEASE SELL. There’s a small chance that you will be able to buy back at that price. Bitcoin is a long game. Happy selling.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:09:57
NO panic! we’re fucked.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:57:09
The question is: Are you dropping in at 6-6.5k? I am.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:47:29
Anytime that you make a withdrawal it triggers a taxable event. If you buy and make gains and don’t withdraw then you don’t get taxed. So any time that you “short” BTC you just created a taxable event on those gains. Worse yet since you didn’t hold the initial investment for a year or more your gains would be subject to short term gains tax at ~30% +\-.  I am just letting some newcomers that are playing the daily short game that your probably not going to make that much money and worse yet you won’t be able to claim a loss. Some people make money playing this game and Im not judging but in this market - unless you have substantial assets I don’t see penny playing is going to win you anything. I am not a hodler and Ill sell when its right but its a long game and think about where YOU think BTC will be in a year from now. Final word of thought to people reading this. you do you.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:33:52
Well thats a good thing. I was preparing for a substantial drop if it stayed below 8350 after 6pm pst. Still trade carefully!

Haha! yep! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:15:19
They have as there are lines on both sides. My advice: don’t read too much into it. Base it on the certainty that bitcoin’s price will decline. But it will never be worth 0 with the masses giving up on it. It has its place in the world and isn’t going away as much as the other side wish it would. Just as one side wishes it would be 100k next year. chin up. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:48:09

Speculation = true. But Bitcoin is a platform of convenient trade world-wide. So in my mind that is the ultimate fear of Central banks in the long view. As that crypto has a potential to create liquidity amongst international trade as an acceptable world commodity. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:11:57
Oh, we’re gonna blast past those 9.5 fuckers and take some names.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:39:49
Nope, Im not grasping, We are seeing just that right now in front of your eyes. It seems as if there are more sellers than buyers at the moment. Driving the price down. Who’s setting the buy orders? New investors and people like me who sold at the top. The HODL narrative is a good set and forget long term strategy. Thats it. My point is that if everyone just held then whats the point of bitcoin besides an insider store of value club. Its meant to be used for trade. It really is the worlds first universal currency. To you’re comment about grasping. I am doing extremely well in this climate thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:33:18
Damn, thats funny! 
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:42:05
HAHA! You a funny guy. 
1. You’re real full of shit
2. You’re extremely naive.
There is no such thing as “smart betting and can’t lose” hahaha!
Anyways I wouldn’t consider myself a hodler either. But I’ve been around bitcoin a day or two. You’ll see. Anyways, this daily thread has become a cesspool. Enjoy the daily ups and downs. I am sure Ill receive another bullshit response -  but I am leaving reddit so you fuckers can have your day as there is no reason for me to be here as I get sucked in to the bullshittery and its useless to me- I don’t have a need to defend myself as I have been very successful. I am very supportive of BTC as I hold more than a few. With that I bid you a good day.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:41:51
6.5k is the sweet spot for me. It might not be the absolute bottom but would be happy with a - 1k difference.

@_date: 2018-03-23 23:37:01
I called it this morning and got railed and down-voted. I feel that in times like these people run to gold. Bitcoin is a good place to go if the DOW is plummeting and BTC is remaining relatively stable. It’s just a theory of mine and not based of fact. Everyone was running for the doors and complaining about potential further drops. I felt bullish and I still do.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:08:56
The tops gonna blow off this fucker. LET THE DOGS HUNT

Jesus, bitcoin is a little over 10yrs old. Don’t expect it to become a form of everyday acceptance tomorrow. But give it time. The infrastructure and acceptance will surely come. It’s not gonna wilt and die.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:20:02
Today we get crucified tomorrow we resurrect I am still confused about April fools and how that fits in.
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:29:28
There’s 3 types of trading. short,mid and long. Most traders here are short traders and I think thats great. I don’t have a problem with short trading. If you’re long then set your margins as to where if by chance that BTC plummets, crashes or whatever that you come out with a small loss but can recoup your core savings. If it makes a good bull run then your margins become better and your able to get out and short trade and you can set yourself up to win both ways, this strategy takes patience. So I see it VERY unlikely that you’ll lose it all and if there is a substantial drop as in a major sell off. then the risk will lay as if you sell or wait out the storm. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:53:29
You can start with stop whining.

Alight- cool Nostradamus. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:59:56
Funny, (not really) I took all of my savings out and invested in bitcoin when they just started going through their controversies. I closed those fuckers down.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:12:05
I think somebody took that dead cat, tied some beer cans to his tail and sprayed some turpentine on his butthole. ��
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:00:47
Even though I’d like it to drop to 6.5- I’m actually bullish. If it drops to 7.8 I’m buying. I think it’s going to make a bull run here real soon.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:27:03
Right. So you ever hear of capital gains? At 300 BTC. Short selling at that margin. Right and I am 1 in a million.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:00:12
This isn’t over. I fully expect a 6.2ish bottom before a major bull reversal. I’m still in at 6.5k the top is about to blow off this fucker.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:27:00
Ok- good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:19:23
Man - that’s brutal. Lets hope that doesn’t happen to BTC thanks for your thoughts.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:10:41
Whoa! there cowboy. No time to be giving high fives and smacking each other on the ass. It could go either way. But its been trending down. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:53:33
Yeah, never underestimate inexperienced panic sellers that are waiting at the door in numbers to sell for less.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:14:16
Sell yourself out to the bottom bro.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:00:23
“short” as in sell and buy back at a lower price? How the fuck do you short BTC?
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:39:39
No worries man. I bought in at that price as well. Don’t fall too much for that hodl strategy. mid/long term trading can work well.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:44:52
I keep hearing this. The “whales” is there proof of the so called whales? Aside from the fact that the speculators took their cut and ran? Right now more BTC is being sold in smaller quantities. You know what that tells me? Ordinary people are investing in bitcoin- not only are ordinary people investing there’s a little more than a few of the so called whales. The more bitcoin becomes diversified the more stable it will be. Bitcoin is a ground up platform and it will succeed. Anyways, I’m tired. One of us will be right guess we’ll have to wait and see. Have a good night.

Theres NO possible way an advisor can give you accurate advice regarding bitcoin save your money. Study, do your research and invest in what your heart and your nerves feel
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:56:44
Pffft. I’m not ruling out that it won’t drop below 9.8k but not much more than that. You terds keep selling to buy low maybe you’ll get there. Im going skiing. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:03:40
It might go down but it is not going away!
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:54:39
I know right? Maybe .....just maybe.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:42:52
well- if we can’t hold 10.5 we’re fucked for another major selloff.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:53:58
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:24:16
Classic Bear trap it seems short sellers were left in the cold it didn’t drop to 6-7k did it?
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:49:56
So the value is going to 5k then? . Great!
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:00:13
people buying.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:54:40
We shall see. If it’s proven you can bet your ass all hell will be let loose. Bitcoin is in my mind a great place to put your money if this happens.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:36:29
I agree with you. But instead of going down negative apocalyptic predictions- I’ll end it there.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:42:17

So you’re advocating that everyone hodl?
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:11:45

@_date: 2018-02-10 19:22:15
Your not making much then.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:50:53
yeah, ok.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:53:33
You know what I like about this community? We might not like each other all that much and we fight on the way down and we fight on the way up. But we kinda build some sort of connection on a weird level.  *keep it weird fuckers.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:50:17
Its this commentary.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:28:41
The last sustained bear market after Mt Gox collapsed. Bitcoin was relatively new to many people and not well known. Also, it was before the last halving and mining was relatively easier. Now, more people know about BTC and are willing to invest or use it. It’s becoming more diversified there will be peaks and “crashes” big holders will sell diversifying it more. Going from 500 to 10k in a couple of years is certainly bullish to me. The big pullback was inevitable.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:33:35
ok. will do. thx!
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:07:03
Things are as long as it keeps banging off that green line and as it consolidates into the triangle. However, it HAS to bump out of the red. .... if not its going down. Great chart.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:26:54
That’s deeply  unfortunate and I hope that you see more to life than temporary losses. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:06:22
Oh! don’t you worry little one. You’ll see what I’m talking about. Have fun making money playing the daily game.

pffft. thats no double top.

Yeah, they were relentless I slayed a few yesterday.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:39:47
I just happen to agree with you. The conflict in my mind is which one will overcome as my goal is to create a strategy for both outcomes. Whichever that may be. But your right as I keep telling myself that gleaning information from a reddit bitcoin forum is a indicator but more likely a false flag.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:25:38
Very likely.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:31:39
FUD mods please delete
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:12:28
I appreciate your thoughts. However, I believe bitcoin  is like predicting the climate as there are past patterns to predict (accurately) scenarios that have shown reliable trends. But if you throw climate change to the mix all those reliable models go out the window. I am betting that BTC will have its better days - as its expanded more peoples minds. I do not believe that we will see BTC go below 6k. But am prepared for it if it does. Trust but verify.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:00:37
Very true. It wont fall below 9.8k. Those folks selling and hoping to buy back at 6-7k will lose their bid.
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:03:31
Oh, I am calm alright, I skied the deepest powder today and it was like poof powder.I have a cold beer and I have a really hot wife that’ll be home real soon and I am going to burst that vein here real soon. So yeah beer, pussy and relaxation is definitely what I am all about I don’t fuck with the stress.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:51:22
Yep, just like inflation and cost of living increases!
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:28:21
Ok- then why are you on reddit with a sub - conversation about how bitcoin challenges the central banking authority world-wide? Either you are concerned (1) or are just trying to convince yourself that there might not be a disruption of the ordinary status quo (2) or you just have nothing better to do but hang out with some cats and try to justify your position (3). My vote is 3. Also, why the hell would Government be concerned? Its decentralized nobody controls BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:18:33
I catch myself doing that as well. It was painful to watch the prices come down that fast.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:01:59

*exactly. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:39:24
Thats all you got? I statement without verification. Sounds like a big ego to me. So how is all this short trading going?   Add up all those transaction fees and taxable events that you made on your supposed gains. I expect a bullshit answer from you. Let me know next year how that works out for you and of course you can keep going down the road of speculation and not paying the tax. But Ill stick to my three points about you. 
Either you are real full of shit, a troll, or an idiot. You see, it’s easy to log on to reddit and correct people of spelling grammar and deficiencies. Its real hard to verify your supposed gains. But I digress. I actually have some real things to do like go backcountry skiing on this wonderful powder day. With that I will not waste another minute on you.

@_date: 2018-03-25 23:05:10
You’re gonna get your chance. It’s appearing that the breakout is to the downside. 7.2-7.5 is probably going to be next price target. Unless we can get to 8.7 and above by morning. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:28:37
Not till it crosses 12k
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:57:16
Time will tell. My bet is that it will change the world. 50/50 double down and besides - central banks have a BIG problem and they better walk the line. Bitcoin keeps those fuckers in check and for me it’s about checks and balances. If you think the all seeing eye of the Fed is a place to run to- I’d think twice or you can invest in clumsy tangible gold that’s still a worthy investment as well. Bitcoins sexier.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:58:42
Oh, I have a clue. I simply said prepare your buy orders. I didn’t make a hard statement like its going to 8800k. There’s YOUR clue.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:41:27
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:16:54
Yeah, on the downside. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:03:45
You geeks still stuck on the buy/sell walls I thought those were debunked when the big selloff happened. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:47:38
HAHAHA! well BTC is a great investment. That is what it is. You invest in it and it grows over time. Then you position yourself to where you can day trade to make money without losing. It’s called PATIENCE. you fools are playing the wrong game and are getting rekt. I apologize for my insensitivity but NEVER take money needed and gamble for a win. Its a real bad idea. I am sorry that you have learned the hard way.

@_date: 2018-04-25 13:42:28
Hope we find somewhat support at 9k. Otherwise there’s a real chance to go to 8.8 then 8.4k. I’m getting real tired of being dragged back into the butthole.
Obviously thats where everyone likes to be. This is retarded.
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:18:42
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:47:58
I myself have a broad and very deep understanding s as well and I see it the other way. I do not make my financial decisions based on a reddit poster. I am doing just fine and if I it reaches my set trigger point. I will sell and still leave with a very nice profit.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:29:42
This blows. I don’t understand why we have to keep crawling back into the asshole of the bear time and time again. I just wish this fucking bear market would die.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:44:07
I agree with you as I’ve been real about this from the start. That is why I set absolute cutoffs so I don’t get trapped into the HODL philosophy if the ship sinks. I always have an exit strategy to protect my gains. This is the point of my conversation. But being called a liar by the above reply’s just go’s to show how emotionally invested most people are on this commentary. A realist I am a liar I am not.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:41:32
Again! LOL! You’re completely missing the point! Not at one point in time have I ever mentioned that I believe that BTC will be the World premier currency. Not at all- The POINT is that the intrinsic value of fiat lies into the trust of the FED. The Intrinsic value of BTC lies with the individual person. Group think/individual think. Now- we are in extreme debt and quickly becoming unsustainable. What happens when it does? WW3. Gold has intrinsic value. it is what it is a fundamental element on the periodic table-nothing more nothing less but what an individual is willing to pay for it. BTC follows these same rules.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:40:10
disagree. There’s plenty of people interested hence the taking of profits.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:30:30
Lets just put it this way. I’ve been in the game since 2013. I bought, I’ve held and I’ve sold and bought low. I am real about the speculation. If we don’t break out of this -we’ll be falling into another bear revival. When 200 sell volume takes out 3000k+ bitcoins on a constant basis one loses hope. Thats the bullshit that I am talking about and besides I am getting real tired of hawking the prices as I watch all my profits chip away. Its fucking exhausting.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:25:11
Oh, I do. Don’t you worry about that. I’ve been in this game since 2013. Take Trumps word that he didn’t collude HAHAHAHA! the man is a proven LIAR. But don’t you worry there I am definitely leaning more libertarian everyday but I will never support that man and you sound like a fool toting the maga political line. There is absolutely nothing he has done to make this country better. As a matter of fact he is more like Obama everyday.

It’s too complicated for them to understand. Let them peddle their “hodl” narrative.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:34:17
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:09:02
Explain to me what basic market structure is then. Because I am pretty well versed. But I’d sure love to hear your point of view regarding this current conversation.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:10:15
Awesome man. Well it’s certainly feels like there are some buyers coming back around. Ill be much happier post 7.5k. Thx!

Lets see where it go’s 6.5k is where I put in at on Easter so either we approach the double bottom of the February dip or it go’s down much further. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:45:44
For a person thats so “addicted” to substances -I sure can articulate my point better than yourself. It points to the fact that you keep creating false narratives thats convenient for your own self worth.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:37:18
I wonder if he’ll pop it like one of those lil mushrooms you get in a jar?
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:10:50
What do you mean by certain hodlers? If you hold and do not make any taxable transactions you don’t pay on capital gains. Am I missing something?
edit: disregard I see your point.
Basically you’re saying that certain people made taxable transactions and are now either holding hoping that price of BTC go’s up to pay taxes or neglecting to report their obligations to pay taxes or both.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:57:12

@_date: 2018-04-07 16:38:45
yeah, well I respectfully disagree with some of those points. But lets see there are certain points that I do agree with. Mostly from the original post. That wasn’t written by you.
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:16:15
Exactly, a lot of people in the US got burned and they are doing the exact same thing again for 2018 tax’s for next year. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:14:24
Maybe so- not one person has explained where the intrinsic value of the dime falls. Besides the Fed.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:24:31
Well hell! guess it finally did reach my target buy! I went all in bro! GO UP!!!!! hahaha!
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:20:47
Its made of cupronickel and is backed by the Fed. The intrinsic value is trust in the Government. My point is cupronickel isn’t worth shit. But we trust it and use it for trade. If the value of BTC isn’t worth shit then it would reflect the value of it and more importantly the persons holding it. Right now it’s close to being worth 7k. I’d say the people holding it have intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:33:36
Start with learning to spell. Then we’ll take you seriously.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:56:09
Sure is lil one. instead of a little fishy - I am more of a barracuda. Because my self worth had me as an early investor.
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:55:07
I find it weird that you held through it all and sold now at this moment when the increase in value seems more and more likely to come.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:02:04
Because reddit commentary has a huge impact on price fluctuations.
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:31:03
Well from my standpoint its a great time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:00:39
I had to sell some btc to pay for taxes. I am sure a lot of people had to as well. The selloff could be very well and in part due to taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:41:05
I call bullshit. U.S. tax law regarding crypto is unusually harsh and completely unfair. Regardless, I paid my damn taxes and I am sure many more than “.04” percent of tax filers did so as well. They can FUCK OFF.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:59:19
again LMFAO!! Yes! I paid my taxes on my BTC transactions- more than I should. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:17:54
COME TOO ME!!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:37:42
seriously go fuck yourself

......also I might add. Really, the intrinsic value of BTC is in the person holding it and the person willing to buy it. It’s people. Now, greed is an original human behavior and THAT is what will drive it to the ground.

I don’t smoke weed. I am trying to generate a healthy debate. But the result is always an insult in one form or another. It shows that you are easily hurt when you can’t justify a strong point.

Have you even looked before posting? They’re up this morning.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:01:07
I’ve been reading your post. What Country are you from? Its good to get a perspective of what the sentiment is.
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:12:59
Terrible advice. You’re suggesting that they hodl until prices go up and pay the interest fee’s plus what they’ll owe for next tax season.

First point: If you’re taking financial advice from this commentary then good luck!
second point: This forum is a one of many places  to pick up on world wide sentiment and It’s pointing up.

Hey asshole. I DID sell in 2014 at 900$ and I bought back in  at 200$ after it flattened out.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:47:38
Rule  most people here are reacting to emotion and have no idea what they’re talking about.
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:56:30
You all have very short memories (I call it digital dementia) A couple of weeks ago it was at 6.8k. It drops down to 8.5 after a pump and everyone freaks the fuck out. If it drops below 6.5k then there is a real reason to FREAK THE FUCK OUT. 
By the way. Sometimes people just wanna buy and sell shit. If someone makes a big dump- guess what?People are BUYING IT.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:16:49
 Nothing is impossible. I set my sell all at 5.9k if it go’s there I am 100% out and will never look back again.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:33:25
Well maybe. Bitcoin is pure speculation atm. So we’ll see where it go’s as it’s a WORLD form of currency. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:02:30
point taken. Dirty ol’ cocksucker?
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:12:55
I can agree with you. Even though I stated it in a comment. I find it hard to believe that a few people are trying to manipulate the market. But sometimes it seems very plausible. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:01:31
we’re getting real close to my breaking point. This is absolute bullshit and I am getting ready to walk away and never look back.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:36:39
Oh, the lister. How about this one. Banks are putting lipstick on a pig that is aggressively ramming its head up the ass of crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:55:41
No. I set fundamental cutoff’s to give the chance that it could go up again. When it reaches my trigger point I cash out. Besides its gotta go down a real long ways before I am at a true loss. I am protecting my gains.
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:40:24
I honestly don’t think it’ll go there. But in the wild west anything can happen.
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:41:41
I would say that this is a world wide phenomenon. I feel more connected with people of the World through BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:27:55
Just as with fiat YOU have the free choice of where to keep it. We’re talking about intrinsic value here.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:46:57
Opinions are like assholes. Everybody has one.
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:37:54
Nah man, I get it. It’s good to hear things from your perspective. I’ve always been real about where this all could go. So I set myself up for success this is all about business.

I can tell you with certainty that the discussions on this forum do not represent a large or a majority of seasoned investors for certain.
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:41:44
So great! they take a huge risk wash trade on their way up and guess what? They sell. Most of the BTC buys are less than 10. That tells me that more people are joining the ecosystem. I personally believe that it’s big holders releasing their holdings and more and more people are buying. Let the big holders sell! We all know that there isn’t an infinite amount. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:31:25
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:32:02
yeah, I figured thats what you were referring too. I usually am thinking tax forward. So I cashed out some when the prices were up in late Feb to settle out before the rush.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:12:28
This is exactly why I am seriously considering leaving this for good. You have absolutely know idea of who I am or what I have. Nor would I ever try and prove it to you on a public commentary. So we are at a mute standpoint. Believe whatever you want about me and conclude your own opinion’s that’s perfectly fine. But Ill wait around a little longer to see what happens here. But at 6200. I am out- 
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:36:23
Don’t put all your trust into that ol’ cocksucker.

Let em’ I only glean useful information from a very few reddit users. Most of the time its a mind suck.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:39:13
Yeah, I see your point. But I sure would like to see support at 9.5 instead of the blasted 6.8k. It’s really getting annoying........and I’m whining- bleh!
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:20:36
It was good while it lasted. We’ll be crawling back into 7k territory.......again. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:39:17
Gold isn’t going away- neither is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is also a hedge against inflation.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:06:47
agreed. last minute tax filers. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:39:09
Well boyz, 
I’ve went from pessimistic to optimistic. I’ve held through that Mt. Gox crash right on up. Sold some and bought back at 6.5k Survived the recent free-fall and I had my finger on the button to sell all if it reached that point. It didn’t. I feel better now than I have before the November spike. I feel that we’re on a good path. Stay real and don’t get too cocky and If you do then you better own a lambo. Happy 420!
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:12:04

Just remember, when someone states that BTC has no intrinsic value- That you the holder of BTC is the intrinsic value as opposed to a group of people putting their trust into another institution which is completely necessary for government to work. BTC gives YOU a way to check all of that.

I bought in when it was 400.00 but I digress.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:06:22
Honestly, I’ve been around this platform since 2014. I feel more than ever that there is a foundational base and that it’s only going to climb from here. But that is only my opinion. I wish you success on the other end of the market. peace.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:21:14
I am starting to believe that. I reinvested at 6.5k and I had a feeling that these cocksuckers would come crawling out of their hole to fuck us all over again but didn’t anticipate so god damn soon.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:37:58
well lets hope 8.4k holds. Otherwise its real deep penetration to 7.8 then 6.8-6.5k
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:40:05
Nope, not angry at all. Do I take my money now or wait and see if it go’s up again? Either way I am doing just fine bro.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:34:26

@_date: 2018-04-17 02:04:26
Thats just plain stupid and that kind of thinking is why a person got there in the first place. Anytime there is a taxable transaction a person should be thinking tax forward and setting aside a portion of those gains to pay for tax owed.
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:46:36
Don’t you know we overthrew that bullshit. Plebian’s always overthrow royalty at some point.

Dude, you’re fucking delusional Trump is fucked.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:35:49
Ok- believe what you fucking want. But I am the guy that is actually winning as I still do have nice profits. Ill let you fuckers know when I sell my stake( if I do) because right now I still have some hope. But I do have a absolute cutoff. Anyways, I’ve became a redditor about 3mths ago to get a pulse of what was going on with the market at the time of the drop from19k to now. It appears that I am being entertained by people like you that really are the true emotional ones. Its truly funny to be called a liar. But thats fine the disappointment for me is not having an intelligent conversation on reddit but get into a pissing match with some real jackasses. I suppose that it is time for me to move on.
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:46:19
The real tax trap is pay 30% capital gains on trades less than a year for every taxable transaction. American taxes are extremely cruel and completely out of touch. So if you sell a portion at the top- boom. taxable transaction take that money buy where you think its low at the bottom and it drops again-you get squeezed, sell. boom. taxable transaction. If you are trading large and you owe a sizable tax - you pull btc out to pay it. boom. taxable transaction for next year. I honestly hate those fuckers but I paid my damn tax.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:00:55
........and that is the great squeeze at the moment as I don’t like losing money. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:07:47
Well geez Wilbur, That sure sounds just like buying low and selling high strategy. Boy, I am sure glad you made me aware of that. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:38:21
If we don’t stay above 9160- We’re going down to 8.5 to 8.8k

realistically neither will happen.

relax bro, you’re on reddit.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:22:05
like 2 BTC gonna make you rich.
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:52:45
Yes. You pay only on the gains and we all know there were a lot of gains in 2017 and if you sell in less than a year its short term gains at 30%. American crypto taxes are FUCKED.
Example: you bought at 400 sell at 1000 buy back at 800. you’d be taxed on the 600$ and if the gains were claimed in less than a year you’d owe 30% 180$. If you were an early investor a person made some serious gains and if they weren’t doing the research regarding capital gains. They OWE a LOT of money. It’d be interesting to get a World consensus to see what other Countries do as I realize that we are not at the center of the World.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:55:10
I am not in despair- far from it. I am tired of seeing my earnings shrink. I sold all my BTH at the highs and bought at 6500 during the last dip and now theres talk of another bear revival. 6200 I am out and Ill still walk away with a huge profit. Its matter of getting out completely or staying in. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:14:34
Look �� at me closely. eye to eye. FUCK MT GOX. now lets move forward.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:07:30
Well, you’re somewhat right. But I will still be leaving with a sizable profit. If it reaches my set trigger point. But regardless, thx for snapping me out of my funk. I’ll try and remain positive and keep from posting personal strategy plans.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:39:23
I’ve read so many predictions about where all this is going. The fact is that no-one knows. Including you.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:13:29
I am. I sold my bitcoin cash when it was at 2500.. I am far from losing.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:42:08
Sooooo thats why you and wunderbrah agree so much. So that we can all agree on one idea? Never have a different point of view.? So we can all agree at once and take each others word for it. Erase competition. pfffft.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:14:34
Yeah, ok bro. You’ve drank the Fox cool- aid.  Its a proven fact that the man is a liar and you’ve been conned. Anyways this is a forum about bitcoin and not how its gonna maga. It’s making the world great. Disagree all you want as I am a registered republican. You’ll see here real soon when the big blue tidal wave envelopes him and he is impeached as it is going to happen. Himself and his family are traitors to the state. Sic semper tyrannis.

Oh, YES! Come too me!
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:25:43
I agree with most of these points. But a couple of critical points are left out. I believe Arizona just passed a law that you can pay taxes in BTC. Bitcoin is a world accepted form of currency I believe the first. When people around here tote the line “that you are your own bank” in the bigger picture I believe that it is a way to fight back against the central authorities. To give people the sovereign right to keep them, in-line a check. Now, speculation the artificial belief that BTC is going to save the world and this and that. Its a completely fabricated illusion and as it was stated to me yesterday by another reddit user. This is purely about business.
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:43:31
because it will.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:45:04
well if any of you were around at that time you would know that it stayed in the 200-300 range for a long time. After Mt Gox 
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:47:29
Yeah, on a reddit sub com because that is really what changes the momentum. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:12:25
We sure have been tested by fire.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:57:32
ITS EASTER MORNING!! Buy now! it isn’t going below 5.8k.  There’s PLENTY of volume below 6.5k on GDAX.

Spot on.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:33:05
HODLLLLLLL! Nah, just fucking around. I expect it maybe-maybe kiss 5.8k but I really doubt it.

Funny, I should just ignore you. But Ill just go ahead and take a bite. I’ve been around since 2014 and hold plenty of BTC. Hardly new at this and far from losing. You shouldn’t make assumptions- you’re really bad at it.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:12:55
No worries there. I am real about my investment and know exactly what I am doing. Put all your faith and trust in the Government and hope and pray that they’ll dig all of us out of debt. Because your intrinsic blind faith in fiat currency is what is truly wrecking us all.
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:58:24
I mean really after a bullshit drop like that - why not sit on your hands and wait for a better price to buy? Also, there’s fresh memories of the Jan/feb/march pile of poop. So I’d think that reinforces peoples fears. Especially the newbies and folks sitting on the sidelines considering investing.
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:55:58
Judging someone by how old their reddit account is just shows the intellect of most of the folks on this sub. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:37:59
That is not hodling. Anyways, I find it funny that all these hodlers come out and lecture people on what hodling is when you yourselves were gnashing your teeth about why you didn’t sell at 14-15k. You really don’t need to lecture me about hodling. I bought in before the first Mt. Gox crash and held right on through it all. I know what its about. I also have an idea of when to sell and buy back when it hits bottom from my Mt Gox lesson.
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:08:44
The first big dip was caused by over speculation the second crash was caused by taxes. People who were smart cashed out early at the 2nd peak at 11k and the others frantically followed. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:45:21
You missed his point. There are obvious fake outs and manipulation happening at the moment on GDAX. Hopefully buyers will start nipping into their sell block bit by bit.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:57:03
I am not at a loss.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:50:26
Again, you’re missing the whole point. It shows that you really do not have any substantial points to make regarding your views. Again, you’re just as emotional as the hodler that hopes BTC reaches 100k by October- Your no different than they are.
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:18:55
Yeah! shut the fuck up DONNIE.
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:28:02
You make absolutely no sense. BTC is a store of value. It sounds as if your saying you need to chug a bunch of goldschlager and shit out a bunch of placer gold to hedge against the bullshit.
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:03:22
You’re pretty funny. I am fully aware of what Bitcoin is and what bitcoin isn’t. You have absolutely no idea of where I am at in this game as you certainly are making yourself the fool.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:17:56
Yeah fuck dat. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:13:03
where’s the intrinsic value in a dime?
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:17:37
What the F\* is that joker talking about? Bitcoin is an absolute Constitutional concept. This guy is a real joke.
Since it is considered property - I guess he is offering to seize it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:00:54
Ok, I’m done here. You are missing the point but Ill explain to you. I sold part of my holdings at 15k bought back at 6.5k. I have a sell all at 5.8k if it ever drops that far down and I will still walk away with a large profit if it does. Ill do it again and again. Do the math. I hold more than a few. My main point is that you fuckers post on why you should’ve held and this and that when some real people actually lost some money. Your little digs are completely unnecessary. The people that bought in at 15k and above. They’re still HODLING and praying for them to make their money back.
