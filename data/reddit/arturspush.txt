This article is partly a lie, but for the most part it's bs. Basically all the major outlets such as bloomberg, reuters, cnn, vice, rt etc. keep publishing these news about Bitcoin trading  in Zimbabwe. It's just simply isn't true! Almost all the trading in Zimbabwe is done P2P. Just go on LocalBitcoins and check the actual prices- Zimbabweans buy Bitcoin with a little premium which is about the same as if you were to buy Bitcoins on LocalBitcoins. So, all those news is just crap! That Golix 1 Month trading volume is like nothing! Bitfinex trades the same amount in no time. Anyways, what keeps me amazed about all of this is how major news outlets keeps us feeding a lie. In this case apparently they haven't mislead people on purpose - they simply don't know what is the real situation and apparently they don't care to check their facts. That's how media works nowadays- it isn't about who is right, it is about who is first.

It's the same as Trump did when campaining to become the president. Whenever he has forced into a corner, he was just basically: 'Look, I have made this much money and built this many hotels'. Like that is even an argument to become a president. I guess Roger saw it actually working and decided to try the same ignorant and full of lies tactics in crypto space, too. Can't say it is complete failure for him taking into account how much money he has made. Obviously, that is his goal- to make even more money and then buy more influence. Eventually he will go down, but not without a battle. The space is still nascent and he can brainwash a lot of newcomers.
