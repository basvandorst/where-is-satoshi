Well I'm black and the vast majority of rap music is purchased by white suburban kids.

I agree. I was inspired in writing this post because of the Sean's Outpost controversy and wanted to know how transparent should orgs be and what ways could we be transparent. Especially for new organizations.

Um there's a huge tech savvy base when it comes to rap. Most rap is consumed by suburban youth who grew up on the internet and have computers.

All you need is a rapper like Drake or Jay-Z to reference it in a song.

Changetip is awesome. I'm building a Veteran org that helps Veterans heal from PTSD. Changetip ran a campaign in August benefiting the org. It's amazing what tipping services can help raise funds.
