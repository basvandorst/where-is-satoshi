Not really gambling, but I know I delayed my decision to buy in a bit too much and now I'm regretting it.

Bitcoin Price Key Highlights
    Bitcoin price recently broke below a short-term ascending trend line visible on the 1-hour chart.
    This could be indicative of a reversal or a larger correction to a nearby support level.
    On the 4-hour time frame, bitcoin price is safely inside its ascending channel pattern.
Bitcoin price broke below a short-term support area but might still resume its climb if it bounces off the ascending channel bottom.
Technical Indicators Signals
The 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the upside. In addition, the gap between the moving averages is widening to suggest strengthening bullish pressure. Also, the 100 SMA coincides with the channel support at $1100-1150, which is also a long-term area of interest.
Stochastic is pointing down to show that sellers are in control of bitcoin price action at the moment, possibly taking it all the way down to the channel bottom. A larger correction could last until the 200 SMA dynamic inflection point just slightly below $1100, but this would be the line in the sand for the uptrend.
RSI is also heading south to show that sellers have enough energy to push for losses. Once both oscillators hit the oversold regions and turn higher, buying pressure could return and allow bitcoin price to regain ground back to the channel resistance at $1300 or at least halfway until $1200.
Market Events
Expectations for the COIN bitcoin ETF approval are still in play but it looks like investors are starting to pare their bullish positions to minimize exposure to event risk. Also, bitcoin has an upcoming code release so it’s understandable that traders are being extra cautious at the moment.
Dollar demand has also gained a lot of traction in the past few days as FOMC rhetoric and U.S. economic data are lining up for a Fed interest rate hike this month. The next event risk is the NFP release on Friday as a downbeat result could unwind these long dollar positions and lead to bitcoin price gains.

You're probably right, I think I just don't want to admit it... lol

WTF is hodl? Shouldn't it be "hold"? I'm a newb, don't hate me ��

True, even if it were to drop by a significant margin, it would just be a good time to buy in...

I bought a fairly large sum on the upside and didn't have much left to buy on the downside, that being said I did manage to buy small quantities twice on the dip. My average is still at a loss. The worst thing is, being in India, I pay a 9-10% premium on the base rate to buy. So I'm always at a loss from the get go...

A - This is money I put aside specifically for this purpose, but would still hate seeing it shrink... Thanks for your advice tho :) 
B - I am planning on doing this as I have a little bit more set aside for the purpose.
C - Very true.

True story! lol It's not like we're(at least me) making informed decisions here... most of us are just buying into the hype, unfortunately that generally doesn't end too well ��

That’s what I said, the size of the government should be smaller but the quality of the governance needs to be stepped up. There are a lot of thing the government is doing, which it absolutely doesn’t need to and would be better off in the private sector. Thankfully one of the big holes(air India) is being plugged, but most of these loss making entities need to be gotten rid off. 
IAS and IPS and judiciary all  need to become more efficient. 
We could go on and on and on like this... 
Edit : spell check.

Less government more governance.

Hi, not sure if you’re still answering questions, but I have a question about large crypto currency exchanges such as Poloniex. Why is the customer service so bad? Do they just not care about the customers or are they just massively under equipped to handle the volume of customers they have?
