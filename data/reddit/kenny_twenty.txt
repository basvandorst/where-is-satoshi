Bull-fucking-shit, dude. You don't have to learn ANYthing to see that the price is dropping. Any average person can sell when they see their potential profits beginning to diminish. 
You're either making excuses or have a defeatist attitude. But either way, you're full of shit.

Hey dipshit, why don't you just admit that you didn't realize who I was responding to, initially. Yet you still doubled down just for arguments sake?
My god, you're a fucking idiot. 
You thought I was talking to a different person, yet felt too embarrassed to admit that so then you began defending someone you had no intention of defending in the first place. 
How dumb do you feel?

I read up until you misspelled "you're".

I'm trying to figure out if maybe you're just retarded.
This is what he said:


You think that's on point?

Ok then, why don't you explain what you're talking about when you said you were going to "rub it in"? I never advocated selling any bitcoin, so what was my assertion that you thought you were going to chastise me about when you said: 


Everything that guy said was on point. Definitely not an idiot.
So, I've never said anything contrary to that. So how would that be rubbing it in, exactly?
Of course you have no answer because you didn't understand what the fuck you were even responding to in the first place. 
You thought my initial criticism was to the person I replied to, or at the very least, a different part of the OP. 
Then you re read the conversation more carefully and decided to defend the assertion, "nothing can kill Bitcoin". 
That's why you're an idiot.

Do you think it's a foolish thing to say or not?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:39:03
You are quite a dumb person. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:43:09
Remind you about what, exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:38:31
I agree. That guys is a fucking idiot.

My condolences for the loss of your balls.

The end of next year.

I'd say that's not a terrible start. In fact, I speculate you'll see 20% in a month. Come back to thank me or chastise me based on the result.

Look at it this way: if you're not a 'five-hundred-thousandaire' with that half a coin by 1/1/2021, John McAfee will be eating his penis.

Your argument is predicated on an illogical assertion. That assertion is that observing your assets diminishing and knowing to sell in order to minimize loss will make you rich. 
Don't be foolish. Make a logical point. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:07:56
Make a salient point rather than an informal fallacy. 
And yes, I have. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:55:09
Sometimes you do. 
And anyway, my point is: that is all you have to do to reduce profit loss if you don't understand any deeper strategy. 
But don't pretend that, "that's not how it works". Because it does sometimes work like that.

Ok. Maybe I misunderstood.
