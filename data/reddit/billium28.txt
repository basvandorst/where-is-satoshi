Thank you great explanation

I want to get into bitcoin but I got a question.  Why transfer your cash over to bitcoin only to then spend it? Is it because you guys made out well on the valuation and got money to spare?

So for the most part if I don't worry too much about the security this provides and I do not have bitcoins yet than it isn't really worth taking this option? Honest question, I would not mind the speculative said if it happened on its own but I'm not going out of my way to work the system. I realize bc is definitely more of a currency than an investment which is good.

What business are you in? Id love to buy a bitcoin atm as a side job.

I honestly don't remember making an account, could this be someone using their email to hack us?

Curious why you shouldn't hold in coinbase?

How far did he really fly in the original vine?

Wish it wouldn't take 6 days to get the bitcoins in my wallet from my checking account. And like 3 to cash out.

Ah, i have my coinbase hooked to checking account. So my debit/Visa is that a CC in their eyes or do I need an actual CC?
@_date: 2015-07-12 11:43:52
Damn thanks though
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:22:52
No not really, I buy through the visa prepaid GreenDot and its annoying finding a store selling them.

They aren't tho
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:55:32
Can you DIY one or is it some real engineering behind it?

They should have limited it to like 2 TED events a year. Now it seems everyone has a TED talk.
