It's a total lowball offer because at that level of funding/equity, the founder of the company would have to give up 100% of the company to get the funding.

I disagree. There would still be a sizable black market for drugs, especially online where you don't have to meet up with anyone in person to make a purchase. At the very least, tax avoidance would be a major motivating factor in driving a black market.

It's why mafia bosses and drug cartels have elaborate fronts and legitimate businesses. Money laundering is critical to any criminal enterprise, plus the legitimate business could be "proof" that the funds being used to pay the attorney came from a legal source.

Very unlikely. It's a highly public trial.

Absolutely correct. This is why it's critical to have a paper trail for legitimate funds if you're going to run a criminal enterprise. All the attorney really cares about is the paper trail. Everyone knows that's not where the money really came from, but you can't prove otherwise in a court of law so it doesn't really matter.
IMO, if he had a way to hire a high powered attorney he probably would have done so by now.

Letting it ride at this point is just dumb. He can cash out his initial investment, repay his loan *plus* take home a hefty return *and still* have a six figure BTC holding. Leaving it all on the table is just plain greed.

Busted bosses had top notch attorneys precisely because they had legit businesses that could show a positive cash flow. Or they had otherwise laundered the money to show a paper trail that the money they're using to pay their attorneys was obtained legally.

Assuming that they were able to continue paying the insurance and property taxes

In the US legalization would be based around the government controlling the drug market for the resulting tax revenue. You would need to be in compliance with all of the government rules and regulations to trade legally. So yes, there would still be a black market for drugs, filled with people who found it cheaper and easier to just sell on their own without any government oversight.
Hell, there are black market cigarettes today.
