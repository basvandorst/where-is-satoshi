We tried Circle and after we went through the sign up process, it required a credit card or bank account from the US. We couldn't go any further.

I pray you never enter this situation and have to make this decision. Your family, your livelihood, and your reputation, or $500.

Thank you. I think I will send my client to a local Bitcoin ATM tomorrow and see what happens.

We have 3 days left before the ransom doubles. It's about 500USD, which is currently about $630CAD or 2.11BTC.

CryptoWall is malware that if it manages to run on your computer, it encrypts your personal files and any files it can get its hands on. For an individual, this usually means things like your documents or music. For a company, this also means files on network servers the user has access to.
Once encrypted, the malware dumps links on your Desktop and folders saying the files have been encrypted and are inaccessible. We found this out by trying to open Word documents that ended up being gibberish.
The good thing is that if you do pay them, they do send you the decrypting program so you can use your files again. They're not after your files, they're after your money. If you don't have good backups, you pay. But they don't want to be traced, so you can't just pay with PayPal or something, they force you to buy Bitcoin and pay them with that.

It's the standard CryptoWall ransom: 500USD which is currently about $630CAD or 2.11BTC

I click the URL and it's not found?

I appreciate any help and the willingness to I assume donate, but in the name of my client's privacy, I will not be posting any wallet addresses.

You can't always do the moral thing.

I hold no ill will to Bitcoin because some criminal decided to use it any more than I hold ill will to fiat currency because that's used in criminal activities as well.

Oh man, this is helpful. There seems to be a decent number of ATMs around my city.
How do they work? Do you go to a machine there, pay, put in a wallet ID and that's it?
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:53:25
Oh, I knew about Bitcoin and CryptoWall. My client did not. This in no way makes me think negatively about Bitcoin. Don't know about what they think.
And yeah, it's technically supporting criminal activity, but what can we do? We can report it happened to the RCMP, but that's about it. Meanwhile, my client has their own clients and business to think about. It's going to cost my client way more than $500USD to recreate the lost work, not to mention the time and angry clients due to delays. It's a shitty situation, but you also have to think about yourself and your own needs. It's why CW is such a successful scam.
Once this client has their files back, I'm going to go through and assist with a more reliable backup structure.
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:24:36
Yeah. It's a brilliant business ploy. The amount is low enough that the cost of restoring backups on non-personal machines could be higher than the initial ransom, but high enough that you get a decent payday for every ~~customer~~ victim you get.

My client had already gone and used the Windows 8 Refresh function and got their apps reinstalled. The originals are likely overwritten long before I was contacted.
@_date: 2015-04-12 21:07:48
I am not the client. Believe me, I have backups. And they did too.... occasionally. It's going to be much more frequent after this.
