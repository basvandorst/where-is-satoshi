No you don't. Your finance puns stop lol. What do they mean then? Gibberish. I work in finance myself and had a good laugh about your eh, 'finance puns'. Make no sense.
Oh absolutely. But the post wasn't about that but your ridiculously random term usage. Love that I called you out ánd subsequently got under your skin. You also seem to have some trouble reading my posts properly, work on that a bit. Happy holidays in moms basement buddy!

'Whales shaking out weak hands'. Lol the people in this sub. Price is driven by supply and demand, last 2 days there was a lot of demand and now more supply. More like people decided that 19-20k was their moon and decided to sell.

'inflation/lending leads to more speculative purchases and exaggerated prices, and eventually bubbles that pop. (Same thing with student loan debt.) Whereas with deflation it seems like it would push people towards making smarter investment decisions and discourage things from being overpriced.'
It is the other way around. When your money becomes less worth you are inclined to make smarter investments or you lose net worth. With deflationary you'd just sit on your money and wait.

People holding Bitcoin helps with adoption no? That's what I've read the past few days/weeks, how good it was that Bitcoin was now on the national media/frontpages. Adaption is literally people buying them and using them, whether that's spending or holding. You have USD or whatever currency in your bank right, a part stowed away in your savings/retirementplan, that's not adoption of the USD? mhm. The network was clogged up when it was sub 10k, let's just stick a fork in it and abandon Bitcoin completely? Or at what price should it trade in your opinion? Back to 1k?

Not every drop is a bearmarket, not every rise is a bullmarket (or bull-/beartrap) jesus. Also, not every drop is a correction. 
Funniest is that so many people on this sub hate on banks, establishment, Wall Street, which is fine, but tryna be finance kiddies with their terms��.

'Due for correction'
'Is healthy'
I always cringe when I read stupid posts like this based on nothing. Doesn't matter whether you've bought at 1k or 19k. You're losing money regardless. And big drops like this cause panic and drop it further since bitcoin doesn't have a intrinsic value. 
Based on what is bitcoin due for a correction? Why is that healthy? I reckon your monthly salary could use a downward correction, no worry though, completely healthy and overdue!

So how is it a good thing? It drops everyone's ROI, scares away the newbies who've just bought in (adaption remember?) and when it hits 5-7k it skyrockets up again. Please tell me the upsides? Just more volantility.
You're contradicting yourself. When it skyrockets again there thus should be another correction? Smh
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:25:23
Exactly. Domino effect. With wallstreet coming in it will be fun
Buy future that btc will rise &gt; pour millions into btc (peanuts for them) &gt; btc surges. 
Buy futures, after you've cashed the previous ones, that btc will fall &gt; dump millions of btc &gt; btc drops.
End result:
Profit on the buy/sell of btc
Profit on both future contracts
Rinse repeat.
Normal investors lose money. Shit as bull/bear market and corrections overdue gets thrown around. Wallstreetboys laugh.

Oops deleted my comment. But there is an unknown underlying value, how can there be a correction? To which price? Its simply supply &gt; demand so the price drops right now. Its not a stock. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:00:53
I don't get the comments that we are overdue for a correction? This isn't the stock market, it is not under/overvalued. What is the real value of btc? No one knows so how can there be a correction? 10k is too high but the 7k's thrown out there aren't? 
Stop with the finance terms and speculations lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:18:50
You can buy directly at bitcoin with a spread/markup while gdax is the actual market price. 
500€+ difference is a bit high so I think theyre lagging because it was around that not too long ago
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:42:48
It is and I agree! However, the futures are still leveraged and simply pointing to the volume of the futures by itself is not enough. The assets you summed up have more inherent value than btc for example. What is a single btc worth? 100 usd, 100k usd? No one knows really. 
And think further than that. Hsbc laundering money for drugs cartels some time ago. I mean, how is that accountable to stockholders? But it happened. Subprime mortgages packages during the housing crisis. If there is money to be made, especially with crypto which is unregulated and a lot of coins/tokens lack inherent value, you can bet institutional money is on it 
Check this out: 
I can give you 20 more of those showing a correlation between future positions and the btc/usd price. A few days ago 400 mio usd(!) got pumped into btc. Thats no regular joe like you or me or a whale in the traditional sense. All institutional money buddy. And yes, huge funds like pensionfunds won't enter btc/crypto. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen at all. 
We're all getting played and futures provided a huge bonus on top of that. No offense but you should be seeing that. 
Oh and futures do not trade in the weekends but that's kinda irrelevant to my point. Please look up the expiration dates of the contracts and the btc/usd price. It plays a major role and if I had a fraction of those funds available to me i'd play this market as well.
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:40:53
Thank that 'saviour/bitcoin jesus' - according to this sub atleast - andreas andou something. Because futures and institutional money would be sooo good and would decrease volantility. Boy was he right. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:08:23
Do I put the blame on him? No, because reading is hard. Just pointing out that the futures, where I'd put the blame on, were supposed to be so good but really they aren't. He was dead wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:16:00
You do get leverage right? Also futures are traded on bitfinex(?) look up amount of short postions vs btv price, it has DEFINITLY something to do with it. And they absolutely do, few days ago someone purchased 400 mio usd worth of bitcoin. That is absolutely constitutional money. With those amounts of money you can dedict the btc price and they know (and do). Stating they don't - keeping in mind the staggering potential to make money this way - is delusional.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:26:45
You do get leverage right? Also, check short positions vs btc price (like this for example:  but keep being delusional. 
Also your whole point about the volume is wrong. Look what happens if 2k btc (=20mio) gets dumped at once lol. And that is just 10% of the daily volume. Calling 200 mio per day insignificant lol. Also, you just state (which I agree with) that we don't know anything about the actual worth of btc. What do you think happens when the majority of that volume gets dumped, insignificant����
My point was that futures would decrease volatility and it absolutely didn't. Also I didn't say 20k was a 'right' or correct price. Just talking about - pay attention now - volatility. No real inherent value + unregulated market &gt; btc and crypto in general will be Wall Streets bitch. Accumulate slowly, dump all at once. Rinse repeat. Close future contracts as a fat added bonus. He was dead wrong. But he was on either the CbOE or CME advisory board so he is either playing people like you or insanely stupid. 
So please do read my comment next time a bit more careful and educate yourself a bit before stating people are wrong.

futures make it way worse. Normally it was bad or good news. Now its just manipulating and raking profits
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:18:55
I would say we agree on most points and got nothing to add to this post really. 20k was the result of massive FOMO/bullrun. Not blaming the professional traders at all or whatsoever, I'd do the same in their position. 
The whole market being in a slump is the result of multiple factors tbh. Bitcoin lacks an inherent value - unlike stocks for example - but it's a real shame futures combined with some big players and even bots are dictating this market so much right now. Again, totally get them; we're all in this for the money in the end.
Just tried pointing out that, while futures tend to somewhat stabilize 'traditional' markets, it isn't the case with crypto. Some were quite wrong with this sentiment and it was kind of foreseeable. 
Anyway enjoy your night/g&amp;t's and have a good one:)
