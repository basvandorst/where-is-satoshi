I agree 100%. The only problem I see is the possibility of some ABC agency holding 1 mm BTC, which isn't much of a problem because BTC doesn't have to be the standard for cypto currency.

If it cost $100,000 to mine and there are no buyers willing to spend say $10,000 then miners will stop wasting the resources on mining btc and the difficulty will drop until equilibrium is reached. It's not as easy as it cost x to mine nyc therefore nyc is worth more than x.

In the future when you find yourself behind a paywall it's worth trying to google the article by copying pasting the link  Then see if they have the article cached.

I never made any claims on the validity of the theory. Either way the "military grade crypto" was public for 20 something years before bitcoin was developed, so I don't see why it would matter. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:57:02
Hopeully you're joking, but in reality I can't see the biggest holders and early adopters or btc being to happy that the govt covertly created the currency. I'm sure many would be looking to start fresh if that was the case. Many of the early adopters distrust the govt.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:17:05


Jesus, I can't imagine the type of classified shit this guy was working on. This is much more than your average healthy distrust of govt. that we're used to seeing around here.

On bitcointalk I see discussion of the message being signed. Can anybody show me how to see the sig?
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:25:17


I hate to get all tinfoil, but now that we know he works on classified projects it gives the theory that bitcoin is govt funded more credibility. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:29:54
Because it is assumed the creator has 1mm+ BTC out of a total of 12.5mm currently in circulation.
They needed us for TOR because having a network full of spies isn't very stealthy. In return for us diluting a a network full of spies we gained anonymity.
If you look at the same scenario concerning bitcoin they would get the better end of the deal. We would be validating and increasing the value of their majority stake in BTC. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:04:42
It's possible it has something to do with the paywall.

They can't afford to pay everyone back in full. That doesn't mean they won't pay you back.

Ughh. I can't believe I'm going to take this bait.
So do you support cash? Or do you think we should live in a cashless society where every transaction recorded and traceable to the spender? I'm sure cash enables CP to levels BTC are no where close.

As someone who doesn't use Twitter it looks like this replies are coming from coinbase. It's confusing I can see why there are so many Sammy replies..

All powerful tools can be used for good or evil. That decision is up to the user.
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:47:12
Real progress would be lower transaction fees. I'll expect bitcoin to crumble if the amount of women or minorities becomes the measure of success.

You ebil white man im going to seize your wallet and redistribute it to POC who really need it.

The one voice of reason in this thread. If this anti white/ anti man sentiment continues to creep in then this coin will not have a chance to stay on top.

Im not a user of Silk Road but i read i the court docs that you had to use a Silk Road wallet if thats the case people just lost a shit load of coin.

I'm with you on the advertising sounding sketchy and i remember a few honeypot bust going down specifically one of the carder forums that have been taken over by LEO.
But as far as i know you don't need to use an exit node to access hidden services and I'm not sure of any techniques to track traffic to and from hidden services.
The only thing we can do is wait and see. everybody has to do their own homework before doing illegal shit and take responsibility if you're caught.

They subpoena the company he was renting the server from and now have full control.

I know I read it too. 
It seemed like you were blaming everything else on the bust besides the point that the owner cross contaminated his online personas, the real reason why this all happened.
@_date: 2013-09-10 18:06:52
Even though this answers what will be done with the land I'm still very curious as to what will be done about crime, fires, the neighboring residents etc.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:03:56
Oh shit!
 
Edit: more info on the hit.

Serious question: Why would a government apply a 51% attack when they could manipulate the price and cause extreme instability?

Yea he fucked up by saying that but there was never a need for him to ever meet any of the agents. They caught him up on some real bull shit.
The emails he is getting charged with linking had a lot of info. I believe Barrett's team discovered that Alexis Ohanian reddit co-founder was negotiating conract work with Stratfor and some other stuff related to him.
@_date: 2013-06-29 01:28:28
Sorry i carelessly misread your comment and was quick to reply.
Anyway that was a great read and i learned a lot from the paper, thank you for sharing it. I really hope TOR addresses the issues and attacks that the study found.

They confiscated the server after they found out Ulbricht owned and operated Silk Road.

Let this be a lesson to remember to avoid cross contaminating your online personas.
There is a ton of info in these court docs on creating a new and improved SR.
