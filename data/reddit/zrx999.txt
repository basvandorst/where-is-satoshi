Heck...that's almost enough to pay for the transaction fee in Bitcoin.

Your Keynesian understanding is ENTIRELY thrown out of the window by currencies like Bitcoin.  The problems with having a fixed supply DO NOT EXIST when the units are extremely divisible.  Your currency goes up in value yet you aren't fixed at a bottom (penny) limit so you can use smaller and smaller divisions and they will continually rise in value--perhaps not as much as other investments though.  That's the KEY part, PERHAPS NOT AS MUCH AS OTHER INVESTMENTS.  This gives you options, yes, you can save and HOPE it goes up in value, but it may not go up as much as other investments--not as rapidly.  Hence, it is in your best interest to save AND invest.

Edit:  


This is TOTAL BULLSHIT. 
  
The EXACT OPPOSITE has happened.  The Fed has been inflating the money supply like the criminals they are.  The ultra rich have been bailed out time and time again and only increased their wealth at our expense, EVERY TIME.
