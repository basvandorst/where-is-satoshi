I think these show the averages for that day in history (meaning that it may have gone above 10000SEK before)

Unrelated to the topic, but guessing you might know this: is there a Swedish bitcoin/blockchain subreddit btw? Or any general Swedish tech/gaming subreddit? I've been learning Swedish lately and would like to find some "hobby subreddits" where I can practice :)
Tack så mycket.

I plan to use 21 for some professional communication (i.e. replace LinkedIn messaging to some degree), as I'm spammed with recruiter emails very frequently.

A very good point, thank you for the correction.

SegWit is about a bit more than *just* scaling from what I've seen. Seems to me like L2 networks will provide an entire new realm of applications.

It's always helpful to run full nodes -- the more Bitcoin's decentralized, the better.
FWIW Bitcoin Core 0.14 came out this week.
EDIT: am a little wrong:

What do you wanna know? Happy to help.
I've been working on a little ["Bitcoin 101" article]( It's a lengthy, unfinished, and probably has a few errors, but I imagine you might learn some stuff. If you don't wanna read, you can also find some links to videos at the bottom of the page as well.

Glad it helped!
One of the biggest "breakthroughs" with Bitcoin was understanding (on a very basic level) how blockchains work. Understanding blockchains helped me understand: 1) what mining is, 2) a good portion of what gives Bitcoin its value.
I highly recommend this video:  in which the narrator created a tool to help you visualize, step-by-step, what a blockchain is. You can play with the tool from the video [here]( There might be better videos out there, this is just the one I found and liked.

It helps keep Bitcoin decentralized and secure.

I bought a book from someone (so there is actual trading going on), though I also haven't had any activity on my own store yet.

I just opened a shop on it a few days ago, though I haven't had any purchases yet. I also purchased a book from someone else but haven't received it yet.
 if you're interested.

Find someone that'll pay you for goods or services in BTC, or buy some of your own. You might try something like [OpenBazaar]( or r/Jobs4Bitcoins.

Wish I could use Gemini but it isn't available in my state yet. Which makes me wonder how Coinbase operates in my state...

Not an expert, but here's my understanding:
Electrum has a specification for generating a key from those words.  The generated key itself lets you access your Bitcoin, which is stored on the Bitcoin network.
Note that I don't think Electrum's seed phrase is compatible with BIP 39's seed words (a specificication which most wallets use for seed phrases).
