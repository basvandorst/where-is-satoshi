I cannot give you much advice about cracking the wallet, but I do have advice about this sort of thing. This advice is for everyone as you are fairly far along the process.
First do no harm. Image the machine if you can. 
If you are going to do anything like imaging, resetting passwords, first test the technique on another machine with a similar setup. Once you have nailed the technique, only then do it on the real machine. 
If you can do any operation outside of your friends computer, do it there first eg. Copy the wallet dat somewhere else that is also a secure computer. Try to do as little on his devices as possible as you want to keep them in their original state, as there can be no going back in some situations.

More like Moore's goal, as Intel did try to achieve it.

The only way to do it is to pay it in installments. That way the hackers do not have the incentive to release it, as they would be giving up the future revenue.

To answer my own question, it appears to be due to the fact that fewer people will use segwit initially and it will hurt the senders privacy. 
According to the segwit doc:
"Using P2SH-P2WPKH as default change output may also have an impact on privacy."
Hopefully that will change over time.

Do not trade on coinbase, especially not frequently. Purely use them to buy and hold, and maybe sell after a good amount of time. The fees are too high for anything other than buy and hold. You're crazy if you try to trade with them.

Where's all the discussion of new use cases, technical discussion, etc. This sub seems to be all about price. is very misguided, and I disagree with them, but I looked at it recently least it's not 80% price posts.
Until bitcoin moves past the investment stage, and into use, it will still be niche.

Does anyone know the developer rationale for the change going to regular addresses, rather than back to a segwit address?

Yep, I'm sure they're considering that too.

That would bring it back to June levels. It isn’t at all insane to think that something that runs up that fast can drop to where it was 4-5 months ago.
Bitcoin doesn’t really have an intrinsic floor to its value, and a lot of people would have considered $1700 a good price target a year ago.

Unfortunately that gets the direction the wrong way. The price drives the electricity consumption, not the other way around.
When bitcoin is $10,000, miners are willing to spend 10x as much money mining as when it’s $1,000, because otherwise it’s not profitable. Yes, there are considerations with respect to ASICS that have already been invested in, so there is a bit of a lag, but you can also imagine unprofitable ASICS becoming profitable for a while if the price goes up a lot. At the end of the day, the price drives the amount of money spent mining.

That sounds great.

I suspect you mean a contributor licensing agreement (CLA) that hands over copyright of the code that you write.
An NDA for a FOSS project would be quite something.

That's cool, but I really wish I could verify it on the device itself. Running a downloaded program and entering the seed completely throws away all of the security inherent in using a nano S.

Ah, that's great! I did not realise that it was a ledger application, I thought it had to be run on the computer in question. Thank you! The architectural design of the ledger is great.

I love the nano S, but I wish it had a better way to double check the seed words. The initial confirmation is insufficient (only tests a few words!), and there is no way to check it again after setup without resetting it.
