Over here at Nerd Merit Badges, we sell the "Bought This Bitcoin Badge With A Bitcoin" badge.  After about 18 months, we had saved up enough to turn all our bitcoins into a shiny gold Krugerrand, which we bought from you at the end of July.
Here's a picture of Nerd Merit Badges co-operator Randy biting the Krugerrand, because that's what you're supposed to do with gold coins, right?
Anyhow, we are satisfied Coinabul customers and would be happy to provide a reference, etc.

That makes perfect sense, and conforms with my experience of how the IRS likes to behave:
"You guessed rock? Well in that case, we choose... PAPER! Please make your check payable to:", etc.

It's almost disappointing how effortlessly accountants take the CRYPTO-CURRENCY OF THE FUTURE in stride, huh? Makes me wonder what _other_ freaky stuff they're dealing with on a daily basis.

When we started selling "Bought This Bitcoin Badge With A Bitcoin" badges, which cost 1BTC each:
...I thought I was going to BLOW my accountant's MIND, but she shrugged and said "can you calculate the value of your bitcoins as of today? Then it's an asset, and we just declare it/tax it like that."
I was kind of disappointed that I wasn't breaking new ground. Vanity aside, though, there really wasn't any difference involved in declaring profits collected directly via USD vs. declaring profits gathered in the form of a wallet that has a calculable value.

Ha! What a nice surprise to come back from vacation and see this.  I'm one of the Nerd Merit Badge guys, and r38y is the other.  Glad to see that our goofiness hasn't enraged EVERYONE.  
Plus, since this happened last week, our stock of badges (which is not hundreds of badges, it's, like, fives of badges -- this is a hobby project) has DOUBLED in value. WHOOOOO!
