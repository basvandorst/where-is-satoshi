Are you kidding? Without exchanges (which are all financially regulated businesses) crypto will revert to private sellers - who will be dodgy and impractical for most people.
The simple fact is crypto found its niche with dark net markets and illicit money movement. Unless some real legit and practical reasons are found for people to transact through crypto it _will_ be impacted by government regulation and then it will take years if not decades for serious adoption to occur.
I do believe there are uses, but we absolutely must attack and subvert all government regulation at all costs. The best way to do this is to ensure politicians are making money from crypto. They clearly are - or China would have shut this down years ago. We need to make sure they continue to profit.

Assuming they accept it, how would you realistically go about making a payment - considering tx fees and times?
Not trolling, honest question

Not really unless you want to pay bitcoin fees and wait a stupid amount of time. If you have less than ~$1k in Bitcoin your best bet may be to pay the ~0.1 or 0.25% exchange fee to buy Litecoin and then use that to transfer to a different exchange.

If you put your offices in Ukraine then you should expect this kind of bullshit. If he didn’t have bodyguards or a gun then he was basically asking for it.
Why call it a British exchange when it’s in Eastern Europe?

So what about XRP?? Don’t leave us hanging :D

Sounds like a company I could get behind actually. Especially since my current Mac is no longer fit for purpose

How many minutes did it take you to close your account?

- Buy when the price is low
- Sell when the price is higher
- Never ever under any circumstances should you be completely without bitcoin

Miners are essentially competing with each other to be the first to solve a block - once it’s solved everyone else gives up and moves on to the next block.
Of course a ‘miner’ isn’t just one person with a computer anymore, it can be a pool of people’s computers working together and splitting the reward.

I think it was necessary to drop cryptography from the explanation like this. As soon as you use the c-word you lose 99% of the audience.
You could also argue that cryptography isn’t strictly necessary - in an ideal world you really would just tell everyone to record that you spent x and everyone would do it. Of course this wouldn’t provide enough incentive or protection in the real world.

Surely a malicious mining pool of sufficient size could have a good chance of messing with your transaction if they really wanted to? They might not be able to block it, but they could delay it.
Hypothetically suppose we know that one of the biggest wallets is owned by an unscrupulous individual who is about to destabilise everything by doing some dodgy deal. If 80% of network power could agree they don’t want this transaction to happen they could certainly make life difficult for this person.

People don’t care anymore - they just want to buy drugs or move money around. The fact is when the shit hit the fan, everyone started using LTC, ETH or whatever else they could to do the tasks they needed. It’s too easy to switch, people don’t care about the tech fundamentals they just care what works and what’s available - same as beta vs vhs, same as everything. Drug markets are abandoning bitcoin in droves - I just paid for weed with XMR and it took 2 mins end to end - even back in the day it would take me hours to tumble bitcoin and wait for all the bloody confirmations. 
Yeah I know Bitcoin isn’t tied down to one use but really right now it’s useless and this should have never been allowed to happen. Why wasn’t Lightning done earlier?

Bitcoin is a centralised currency, it’s just centralised around a shitty core development team that uses the phrase “a store of value” as an excuse for making it useless for me to buy drugs with their currency because the tx fees and times have become absurd.

Ok cool, in the meantime there are dozens of alternatives that do scale already and we’re all using those instead.
Bitcoin needs to stop embarrassing the community.

That’s it, I’m cancelling Prime today. I’ve had enough of their bullshit. Fuck you Amazon I hope you fucking collapse, you slave driving cunts.
