Doing my googling i found that multibit HD, being unsupported, has the exact same problems with unconfirmed transactions as classic.
Trezor and other hard wallets are not an option for me at the moment.

It says there though that the maximum fee the slider can set is 50sat/byte, but the fees now seem much higher than that

I'm afraid that simply sending will end up with unconfirmed transactions (googling turns up these problems), and I cannot adjust fees in multibit classic.
Please consider me a complete noob for these purposes that requires basically ELI5 instructions.
this is a 4 year old wallet that I'd almost forgotten about that i backed up on my external HDD which I only went looking for when i got back into crypto a couple months ago

How did you manage to send from (A) to (B) when Multibit's fees are so low and can't be adjusted? no unconfirmed transactions?
I actually managed to find the deleted comment (Thanks Wayback Machine!) but the above still eludes me.
