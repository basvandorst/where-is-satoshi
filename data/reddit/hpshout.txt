Pretty sure Satoshi never described Bitcoin as "digital gold"
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:26:09
Well, the internet wasn't very exciting when it was slow. Believe it or not, better technology on top of it made it usable. Some other "coin" or whatnot will replace Bitcoin eventually.

Realistically though, in 10 or so years quantum computers will be so powerful they will be able to crack every private key in existence, rendering Bitcoin obsolete.

Aren't banks free in USA? In the EU using a debit card is free - zero fees. This "Tenx" to me sounds exactly like a European bank card
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:12:52
Isn't insider trader fine though - this is the unregulated free market you dreamt of? Isn't it? You are free to make your own market, and insider trade on that to profit from.
Don't act like BTC isn't insider traded/botted/pumped like crazy

What's the point sticking your heads in the sand. The MTGox contagion will spread eventually in the form of arbitrage as people flood the exchanges with all the cheap Bitcoin they got from MTGox...
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:20:30
They fled their office and moved to a "virtual office", Karpeles probably isn't even in Japan any more.
Signs point to $0
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:38:21
When did MtGox die? It's not 100% confirmed. 
Bitcoin won't die over night either way, how about call me out on this in a few weeks or months time and see who is right 
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:59:07
Because the contagion hasn't spread yet... people are hedging their bets and waiting to see what happens next.
Stop being so deluded. There are two possible outcomes to this shitstorm - 
1. MTGox opens withdrawals - then expect a huge price drop as $100 Bitcoin floods onto the "$600" exchanges, the price will meet half way or less
2. MTGox completely folds, taking with it the confidence of current and future investors and effectively crippling any long term viability for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:39:13
Bitcoin is suppose to be a currency though.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:25:57
All of that is useless though after Mass Media inevitably trash Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:34:02
Mt.Gox imploding pretty much killed Bitcoin's widespread adoption. Average plebs just think "well this is unsafe and stupid"... and that killed the Bitcoin - no smart investor will buy into Bitcoin at this point, there is literally nobody left to blow up the bubble like before

Kind of feel like this was all orchestrated to make Mark money... who knows... would you put it past him?
Not exactly hard is it... make the price crash, and just buy up everything being sold cheap... then put the price back up and claim it was a hack

Another delusional Bitcoin psychopath. 
PayPal vanishing and losing everyone's money would kill trust in electronic money transfer/holding services.
Stop trying to comfort yourself. This whole catastrophe has devastated trust in Bitcoin as a whole for new investors 
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:09:29
Because that's the biggest shill response ever. I doubt anybody actually "buys cheap coins" when the price crashes... but rather says it in hopes other people buy, thus protecting the shill saying it
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:05:27
I've become entirely disillusioned by Bitcoin... especially recently revelations about Mt.Gox... I just feel like the entire thing is a huge fraud now, especially the price - I am not sure where the real Bitcoin price even lies, because it's become evident that Mt.Gox has had Bots buying coins for years now to fix the price...
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:16:49
In before MTGox claimed they got hacked now, and everyone will forget about the liquidity problem :)
Cunning plan Mr.Karpeles

I've always firmly believed "Satoshi Nakamoto" was a group of people.
Notice how his spelling fluctuates between British English and American English between different posts - this certainly isn't normal, and there really is no other explanation to it other than multiple people were using that username to post.
An example:
 - here he uses "colour"
 - whereas here he uses "color"
This is just a tiny sample, but there are literally hundreds of discrepancies in spelling and other features of writing most people wouldn't notice.

@_date: 2014-02-20 19:21:33
But MTGox hasn't shut down, don't claim Bitcoin is "flourishing" when it is down -10% on other exchanges.
This crash is happening right now, and the end is yet to come.
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:17:32
Usually the final excuse when there is nothing else left is to claim "but I bought at X price, therefore I am still in profit"
They fail to realise every fall = creates huge swathes of people who bought at a loss... which compounds the problem.
I wonder how these people will feel when the price drops back to the price they bought at... and they also have zero profit... but could have sold at $1000+

I made two claims. MtGox hasn't "died" yet so the outcome hasn't actually come to fruition.

@_date: 2014-02-20 19:17:25
Yeah, feel secure all those new and old investors who have their money tired up in Bitcoin lose their money... you are a true asshole.
MTGox shutting completely = a loss of faith in Bitcoin as a whole, people will keep citing how MTGox crashed; therefore don't buy Bitcoin.

I wish people would stop saying MT.Gox is some isolated problem.
The other exchanges are trending downwards -10% today and still going down.
MT.Gox affects all of Bitcoin, if it folds it makes Bitcoin on a whole look shady as fuck and unsafe - don't try to pretend it is isolated and not connected.

Debit card stolen - you are covered by insurance and lose nothing in the end, most likely your bank automatically notices the suspicious transactions and blocks the card immediately
Bitcoin wallet stolen - you are fucked with no means of recouping your losses and Reddit/the Bitcoin community will laugh at you for doing things which were apparently "wrong"
Yeah... Bitcoin will surely "win"
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:35:28
I already got downvoted by psychopathic Bitcoin believers so what's the point in responding.
There is zero transparency as to what is going on. Who even knows it MTGox is liquid any more, who knows what they are doing.

People on the fence, because they have no fucking clue what will happen next.
Maybe withdrawals open? Then a flood of Gox Shitcoins crash down like a huge tidal wave onto the other exchanges as people try to make 5x+ their money, making the price crash down to Gox levels.

I use Gmail with 2 factor, and IP alerts, so that can't be it (no suspicious IP activity in history either in the account).
I don't actually have any Bitcoin software on my computer any more, so no backup to be stolen. However, my computer is very secure either way, I use online banking with HSBC and Paypal frequently, so they would have been compromised too by now.
I was being sarcastic about the police by the way, just expressing how for regular people Bitcoin is pretty much a huge security risk, even if they take various steps like 2-factor security, it essentially means nothing.
Could have been this guy I guess -

The hell are you talking about.
How about ANY person who bought above $600... currently has lost money (right up to those who bought at $1200).
Not to mention those Mt.Goxxers...

Like any Ponzi scheme there is real money floating around - if you get in early enough.
People gunna be left holding a bag of shit
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:14:56
Quite plausible. People suspected MTGox of price manipulation long ago... maybe without Gox Bitcoin would still be $1

People realising that the price was a huge lie  created by the Mt.Gox buy bot... people are kind of on the fence really - especially the Bitcoin nutjobs... oops I mean Bitcoin believers... they refuse to believe the price will crash.
Someone is gunna be left holding the bag of shit
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:07:57
Why should he? Those are his Bitcoins. He wasn't stupid enough to store them on Mt.Gox
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:37:07
MtGox is already having a corrupting effect on Bitcoin.
Mass media have turned on Bitcoin and are ripping it to shreds.
We warned you all!
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:38:53
I remember when people defended MTGox... people always thought it was dodgy, but noooo MTGox is fine
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:24:31
Seriously just go fuck yourself. You're too deluded it hurts, Bitcoin will be fine! Just keep telling yourself that over and over, and please don't respond any more. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:34:11
always has and always will be full of bitcoin "believer" psychopaths. Even if the price hit $0 they will still believe
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:16:17
Once MtGox opens withdrawals the price will crash on the other exchanges.
Arbitrage. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:42:10
Most Bitcoin is owned by a minority already anyway... I'd rather see it crash down than see assholes like the Winklevosses get rich
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:40:46
Yes, let's talk about the past to prove something in the modern World. God, you Bitcoin believers are truly psychotic 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:41:25
Yeah keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2014-05-18 16:21:07
Transaction volume is plummeting though.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:45:57
Bitcoin holders have such foggy vision they see things that aren't real... those "experienced traders" were most likely bag holding shills

Anyone check his new "virtual office"
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:22:27
You make it sound like you can just stick your head in the sand and ignore the reality.
Yeah, remove Gox from every site - that'll somehow prevent the coins ending up flooding other exchanges
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:36:30
Mark should be more worried about all those dangerous criminals that were probably harbouring cash on MtGox... 
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:14:45
The wealth gap is just as big in Bitcoin though... most of the wealth is held by a few people
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:19:37
Delusion at its finest.
After this debacle Bitcoin is effectively dead for mainstream people. Who cares about "Bitcoin cashmachines", your average Joe will look at it and say "oh, after what happened with MTGox I don't want to trust that..."
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:36:56
But MTGox is "part of the family" so to speak. We are all in the same room, and there isn't anywhere we can "bury" it without causing a stink.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:31:54
Or the Ponzi is finally unravelling ?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:51:22
I'm British so neither of those things mean anything to me.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:13:42
Someone should edit it so it has "lost it all on bitcoin"

I believe it is the devs fault.
Write dodgy code? Why should it be the people who use it's fault?
Maybe the bitcoin devs should suck it up at admit their fault 
@_date: 2014-09-30 21:16:09
I'm sure someone at Blockchain could just login to any account and transfer money, it's got nothing to do with private keys when the wallet has been uploaded to Blockchain
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:45:09
Now you're arguing different things to prove your original claim, bitcoin isn't an online shopping store so incomparable 
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:34:59
Exactly. This is why Bitcoin needs regulation, because as it stands the price is just too easily manipulated - who knows what other exchanges are doing... in fact a lot of charts look dodgy as shit with price spiking up and down constantly with an obvious force behind it preventing it going down
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:11:03
If it never opens - bye bye any future investor trust, Bitcoin's future will be forever niche.
If it opens - hello huge arbitrage, expect Bitstamp prices to swiftly collapse and meet the MTGox price roughly midway - probably less.

The office doesn't actually exist apparently - it is a "virtual office"
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:59:19
I can assure you, without a doubt, my system is secure. You blaming me and my system, is equal to me blaming Blockchain, neither us really know anything about what's going on here, you have no access to my computer to prove or deny my system is to blame.
The truth is, there is no reason why a hacker would steal $10 of Bitcoins, when they could just swipe thousands from my bank accounts/Paypal - especially if you seriously believe I have a RAT/trojan installed on my computer
The real reason Bitcoin is difficult to make widespread is because assholes like you  immediately blame the user/assume their computer is somehow infected. Meanwhile, in reality Bitcoin has major flaws in security and no comeback for theft, even for the most secure of users.

There was a thread yesterday about this.
IS a huge glitch that allows you to find out Coinbase emails... someone has just done it on a massive scale...
The finder tried to alert Coinbase to it... but to no avail, so released it publicly to force them to fix it (seems they still did nothing)

At least has given up calling it a currency... So it's a technology now... Cool

A pretty much unknown website.

You make it sound like Mark Karpeles and MTGox are the embodiment of professionalism and that it is entirely implausible they could be so unprofessional

Let's wait and see what happens to all those MtGox monies then 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:04:51
MTGox has always manipulated prices... this kind of proves it really, probably their manipulation bot turned on again

@_date: 2014-04-03 15:09:32
Why do I keep seeing this stupid chart?
The price isn't going up like that chart suggests
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:59:03
So pretty much confirms the price of Bitcoin is solely due to MtGox market manipulation... Like many expected.
MtGox went bankrupt for the price to be where it is today... Everyone should feel happy but simultaneously disgusted so many people have been ripped off to artificially inflate the price.
Makes you wonder quite how long bots can keep bitcoin artificially high 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:06:47
Bitcoin can never be more than niche.
The thing is sovereign currencies are protected by the armies of nations. If someone tried to destroy the USD America could wage war in order to protect the value of their currency. 
Bitcoin has nothing to protect it from attacks, and I can't imagine any country adopting it full scale 
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:08:17
Put your money where your mouth is then? Judging from your history you never tip... Just complain about tips.

@_date: 2014-02-20 11:24:11
I thought OP was being sarcastic to be honest.
MTGox dying infects Bitcoin as a whole with a disease that will eventually kill it.
MTGox, whether you like it or not, was (and probably still is) the biggest name in Bitcoin - when it goes pop, there goes any and all future investor confidence in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:57:09

Currency? Bitcoin certainly isn't a currency seeing as it's so incredibly volatile 
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:24:46
Seems Bitstamp has installed on of those price manipulators like Gox had
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:54:03
A legitimate market wouldn't react like this either. Seems like entirely an inside job, price manipulation, deceit, trickery... 
If it is real, and withdrawals do open, and GOX didn't just screw everyone, then all the other exchanges will be flooded with $100 bitcoins and crash the price 
@_date: 2014-05-14 08:49:28
This isn't early though... Mining Bitcoin easily on a laptop years ago was early 
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:33:46
Who is lying then?
Everyone vilified Mtgox, and claimed everyone is safe... yet turns out that was a huge lie
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:36:20
Poor homeless guys, at least they can pick up those coins - maybe will be worth a few dollars at the end of the week

Use your brain a little then... Assuming you have one... Rather rather calling people assholes because you can't comprehend things 
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:36:10
Pretty sure no... I mean, my limited knowledge of pools is that you create a pool worker with a different password... possibly you could find out the the pool user and pass from the conf file and if that person was stupid enough maybe the user/pass is the same as the actual pool login?
Edit: that's assuming it is a pool miner... if it's just a normal miner with a wallet.dat maybe you can take it that way

Plot twist - He actually is Satoshi, but he lost his private keys and is using this as a way to get back some Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:57:17
You should be worried about the MTGox price though.
As soon as withdrawals open all those Bitcoin will flood the "higher priced" exchanges, and the price will rapidly drop meeting somewhere in the middle between the two.
Don't be so delusional as to think MTGox has no influence on market price - it is a powerkeg about to explode
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:08:53
Why anyone would trust someone called "Danny Brewster" is beyond me

@_date: 2014-03-20 09:43:56
This is also negative though... shows Bitcoin's value has been massively inflated and most likely unsustainable 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:08:20
What if OP is Mark Karpeles? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:10:05
Is this a leak from the diaries of Mark Karpeles... Filed under "how I lost all the bitcoins"?
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:09:13
They have at least this much - around 2-3% of what is available now
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:17:23
If it can happen to MTGox, why is any other exchange safe?
Think logically like a real investor and not a Bitcoin "believer" psychopath
@_date: 2014-09-30 21:52:20
It's just annoying that people instantly assume "oh, you must be on Windows/virus/malware" etc, and automatically assume anyone and everyone is some kind of computer retard who is running Norton... and by the way I've never heard anything as stupid as a "reverse proxy".
If my computer was truly compromised, I'd have lost actual money from my bank, Paypal, eBay, Gmail, but there is absolutely no suspicious activity on any of my accounts. These apparent super hackers that have someone bypassed all my security would have taken things of value, and not $10 worth of Bitcoin dust on an ancient Bitcoin address I once used.
I can guarantee you my system is secure, and I doubt that wallet was compromised through my computer, because at one point it actually had a quantity of Bitcoin worth stealing on it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:30:45
Fiat FUD
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:35:31
It will severely harm investor confidence. "Bitcoin" will carry negative connotations after it gets trashed
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:53:29
This wouldn't happen in real life though due to laws and regulation 
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:58:20
This is just production though. With language learning we typically have forms become entrenched... a word like "colour" is so frequent it's rather implausible to believe someone would switch between two forms between different posts.
I'm sure a true forensic linguist would have a field day and be able to prove that Satoshi Nakamoto is definitely not one person
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:36:44
Bad analogy since there is no alternative.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:14:43
Mark Karpeles is obviously behind this. He sold "fake" coins to skim off all the real money floating on the exchange
@_date: 2014-04-13 15:26:51

It is thanks to Gox the price is even this high - their buy bot price manipulated for god knows how many years.

@_date: 2014-03-20 12:19:29
This. Nobody really knows the "actual" price of Bitcoin... everything is a huge lie built by Mt.Gox bots... 
Right now people are just on the fence... someone gunna be left holding the Bitcoin bag though
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:31:57
Sounds like the words of some crazy cultist... Bitcoin isn't a cult is it?
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:07:31
This is an ad hominem argument though... so what if fiat is worse, bitcoin is also bad, and the fact fiat is bad makes no difference
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:45:10
Wait and see you deluded asshole. I'll certain come back to call you out. 
MtGox dying will slowly kill Bitcoin, the media are already turning on Bitcoin... Eventually the whales will start selling and losers like you will be left holding a big bag of shit.
A new technology can't survive all these awful catastrophes... What new customers will trust bitcoin once the coming media shit storm rains down... That'll be a miracle if it happens 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:25:12
Just because it is Chinese Yuan, doesn't actually mean you can get those Chinese Yuan into China easily (or even legally)
@_date: 2014-03-17 07:32:23
You're pretty deluded it seems.
As we can see honest MtGox is still running and no money was lost ... And Mark Karpeles hasn't apparently run off with millions in money - artificially inflating the price made him more money quicker 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:31:18
Alternatively the Chinese government cares more about its own people than foreigners, and have given their people a nice warning to jump ship
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:53:39
That's nice and flowery... but the price is plummeting 
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:26:24
More people buying with BTC = lower price because vendors using bitcoin instantly cash out... This just makes pressure grow... It's downhill from here 
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:28:07

Funny thing is I doubt people who claim they are "buying cheap coins" actually are, just trying to create the illusion that people are "buying" therefore you should too, thus keeping the price up

I feel the same way - only we're not allowed to have negative thoughts
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:51:47
Surely market manipulation and "bad guys" are the reason it's this high? MtGox was the same - price went up from fake trades etc...
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:53:36
Serious question - why can't mining just be replaced with virtual mining, or something that doesn't use up so much electricity?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:52:21
I can't see Tesla being involved with Bitcoin given the electrical inefficiency of the network.

You're actually 100% right, it's true for any altcoin too.  Once people sell off, then regret - it becomes almost their duty to ensure the coin doesn't succeed. Any succeed just adds to their feeling of failure for selling low and missing out.

Are the FBI still going with the "leaky captcha" as their evidence for catching him?
Fact is, there is no way in hell a "leaky captcha" is what got him caught - someone would have found this WAY before the FBI did. The evidence they do have therefore was obtained illegally... but what does it matter, this is what they wanted (so it's all covered up)

You seem to lump "people" into a huge category who bought in below $100...
Why do you think the price has been going up? Magic? No... people bought into Bitcoin at as high as $1000!
If you can't see the reason people are worried then haha, there is only so many up and downs Bitcoin can take, and no amount of market manipulation will attract new buyers

He has a point... Right now Bitcoin is kept alive based on greed... As long as people can pump and dump... The ride will keep going.
There will be a point though where no more idiots will keep buying in and getting burned.
I think the next big crash will be catastrophic

It's especially difficult to take money into or out of China, Bitcoin effectively bypasses the Government's current restrictions - therefore, anyone can see it'll get banned in China very soon

The delusion is is reaching incredible heights - resulting in shitheads like OP creating fake profiles to astroturf by pretending to be Chinese and speaking in the most obviously fake "broken English" I've ever seen.
The exchanges in China will most likely be shut down as they provide monetary exchanges.
How is that good exactly? You can't "trade" it like now.
Nobody ever claimed Bitcoin was a commodity either... the intrinsic value came from it being an anonymous currency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:25:12
Wow, OP bought in at $1000... I'd have thought judged on the thread title you bought in at $100.
How are you not worried... you know full well it could go to $100 or lower, and may never recover
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:28:47

The way I see this is it's the Chinese government giving its citizens an early warning to GET OUT.
Obviously they don't want to hurt their own people financially - therefore, this is for me the first step in ultimately banning bitcoin completely - heck, they even state it is used for illegal purposes... why would they say that and allow it to exist long term?

So am I. It was the fact Chinese websites were accepting Bitcoin as payment which drove up prices. Now that is banned (due to Chinese *policies*)... well, the prices have inevitably fallen to -30%/-40% value in a few days.

What will happen is this - 
People will have bought "low" on other exchanges, then flood MTGOX with what are realistically overpriced coins.
People will think "wtf... why should I pay $150... they are $50 elsewhere", then the price will fall, and then crash eventually

Sorry, but as an English teacher, and Mandarin speaker your poor attempt at pretending to be Chinese made me laugh - this is the same shit I have to deal with in level testing of Chinese students who blatantly just try and get put into easier levels.
A lot of rules in Chinese/English are the same, both are subject-verb-object... Chinese negate verbs like in English, NO Chinese would EVER negate a verb with a negative after it (since it's the same rule - so when you say "We trade btc/ltc *never* through any bank..." is a blatant fake error to make it seem like you have broken English.
No real Chinese would omit a definite article "go to moon"... Chinese typically use too many definite articles if anything... I always hear things like for example - "i visit *the* reddit everyday", this stems from Chinese having measure words for everything, it's an impossibility it would be omitted by a Chinese speaker!
Same as "we think btc/ltc..." a definite article would always be inserted here by even sub-part English speakers in China.
"this is really a good news"
Chinese has the same adjective rules as English, there is NO fucking way they'd split an intensifying adverb + adjective with an indefinite article, just no way.
Also a sub-standard English speaker in China uses Chinese ordering when using English - In Chinese location/time come at the start, so "We think btc/ltc is network gold in china" would almost always, at least by a low level user, be stated as "*In china*, we think btc/ltc is network gold".
You overdid it with the fake errors which is the big give away, in particular the usage of definite and indefinite articles - you randomly omitted them when it sounded like bad English to not them there, and included them when it sounded bad to have them there.
This was obviously done intentionally, since you are most likely a native English speaker - you know either including or omitting them sounds bad, so intentionally did it.
Also, nobody mentioned LTC anyway - another thing that seems odd.
