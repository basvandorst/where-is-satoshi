Because with $100 billion dollars, one individual could easily compromise the bitcoin network, either on the market side of things or on the tech side. To initiate a double spend attack, it would cost far far less than even the current MC of BTC, especially if one went the Selfish Mining Attack route. Additionally, one could essentially ruin the market for Bitcoin, just by accumulating Bitcoin and then dumping. 
Now why someone would do this and what their incentive would be is a different question.

Fair, and I agree it's naive to assume a collectively desired end goal. However, the reality is, for Bitcoin to progress past its current place, certain challenges must be overcome. The goal of this post was to highlight those challenges that need addressing.

I like the approach of starting small to get people involved with crypto. That's a good approach.

I would point to the fact that, in the West, we take a stable and secure currency for granted. But millions of people don't have that luxury. People in many countries are desperate for some other way of securing their wealth instead of relying on corrupt and ineffective governments. Frequently, they turn to the USD for security. But the reality is, the USD isn't a good hedge. If/when the U.S. goes through an inflationary depression, people will turn to Bitcoin.   
It's also a reality that international money transfers are insanely expensive and inconvenient. Bitcoin is the best alternative. The only reason it hasn't replaced Western Union yet is because it's still inconvenient to use. It's just a matter of making it convenient enough to use (exchanges, wallets, etc.) before people begin turning to it.

Damn. Always use bookmarks!

Another way to look at this is that, currently, a single individual could destroy the Bitcoin network.

Can you clarify? Do you mean, what is the difference between the leaked data and a simple user ledger that interacted with the exchange?

Thanks for this post. Looking forward to the day when secure solutions emerge that simplify this process

It's the classic problem that networks encounter. A beneficial ecosystem needs many users. But to acquire lots of users you need a beneficial ecosystem. The reality is though, Bitcoin already has passed this stage. It is beneficial for people to use Bitcoin. Maybe not as many people as we'd like are using it yet, but if it continues to be useful, people will continue to join. I honestly think patience is the key here. The fact is, blockchain and bitcoin were virtually nonexistent 10 years ago. We're creating a new asset class here - a new form of money. That takes time. Our progress has been enormous thus far. That we haven't yet reached the point where people are buying groceries with crypto is to be expected.   
One step at a time and we'll get there.

Because they'll want to buy your BTC...

The reality is, a centralized, directly associated, advocate of Bitcoin wouldn't just be dangerous for Bitcoin, but it would likely lack credibility. Bitcoin benefits greatly from the network effect. If Bitcoin can solve some of its main barriers to adoption and begins to rise again in price, a centralized advocate won't be necessary. Decentralized advocates will spring up everywhere.

I don't think you're late. Better now than in February of last year! 
I advise you to think carefully about the impact of decentralized technology outside of just Bitcoin. If one tracks the progression of various structures in our history, the continuous trend of Western civilization has been towards one of decentralization. Decentralization of economics (Capitalism), Decentralization of government (Democracy), decentralization of empires (nationalism). The digital world is next.

Solutions like this are important. But the reality is, centralized crypto cards will likely be replaced by large banking credit solutions when crypto gains more mainstream adoption. The startup credit/debit cards that are worthwhile are ones that allow you to spend your crypto while still maintaining control over it in a decentralized fashion. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 12:18:00
It just demonstrates that we successfully verified that decentralized technology is absolutely necessary. There's too much demand too much potential for decentralized solutions to many of the problems people face today. We have a ways to go, but the market does not reflect the potential today. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 10:32:50
You're welcome. I would agree. It's just unclear exactly what use bitcoin will take. That's something that has yet to be decided.
@_date: 2019-03-21 09:45:41
I think we need to solve two things - first, the price needs to stabilize. Too many people have Bitcoin as an investment and would never spend it when they expect the price to rise. Second, many people are uncomfortable with the capital gains taxes and regulatory limitations associated with spending their crypto.   
Also, as Bitcoin\_Inquisitor said, not every country supports this. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 09:54:56
We need to change the narrative surrounding crypto and blockchain. It's not about "blockchain" as much as it is about decentralizing the digital world. Industries and organizations and institutions in our physical world have undergone dramatic, decentralized transformations. From capitalism to the reformation to democracy, decentralization has, time and again, demonstrates its value to humanity. Its impact on the digital world is inevitable. The question is, how do we achieve that. Blockchain is the first stab at bringing decentralization to the digital world.   
Whether it will be the solution is debatable. But that the digital world needs decentralization is indisputable.

It's an excellent example of free market economics at work. Torrenting will end when legal services offer a competitive edge -- in this case, security. Most computer saavy people can get any content on Netflix for free via torrenting. But people still pay for the service because it is so effective and convenient.
Not condoning torrenting at all. It's stealing. But winning in the game of competition is the only way to end torrenting.

You need to be able to accept Bitcoin for this!

I would check out [ZenGo]( \- it's the first noncustodial, keyless wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:43:54
Deposit at your local bank. They'll credit it you with $5000. That's how it works...right? 
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:06:38
I think we certainly need a solution for people who have your mentality. We can't expect everyone to choose between trusting exchanges or risking user error with their own keys

First, recognize that supports/resistances are no perfect science. But some main principals you should recognize. 
1. Resistances, when broken, become supports and vice versa. 
2. The longer a resistance or support has held, the stronger it is. This includes historical evidence as well. 
3. Numbers like $4000, $5000, etc. hold psychological strength in addition to just acting as a support/resistance. 
As for what the main supports are, we have supports at:
$3000 
Resistances at: 
$6000 
Another at about the $7700 
Please consider these as rough estimates and not investment advice at all

I agree it's very risky to store it on paper. But memorizing it is not a viable option either. We really need an option that eliminates the need for storing private keys or seed phrases without sacrificing on security by using a custodian. Check out ZenGo - they're working on something like that.

What you're talking about is an inflationary recession. In the long run, this could potentially be good for crypto. The issue is, in this kind of scenario, people would have far less money to invest. It would likely result in a global recession. It would be bad for everyone and everything, including Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-07 10:42:07
That's why keyless, noncustodial wallet solutions are critical. We all might love the ideological concept of everyone storing their money, but it's just not realistic for everyone. We need solutions that provide security and recovery options, without requiring people to give up control of their money to custodians.
