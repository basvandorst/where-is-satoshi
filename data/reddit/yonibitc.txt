Blinktrade provides a 100% open-source technology that can be found at  (contributions are welcome).
Besides providing operators with technology, BlinkTrade also offers what we call the BlinkTrade network, the network consists in a chain of bitcoin exchanges connected using our platform. Because the exchanges are all part of this trusted network, the bitcoins can be sent across the world off-chain and instantaneously. That way we avoid the volatility that can happen in the 10 or 60 minutes that confirmations usually take.
In order to be a part of the network, all operators must follow a set of rules:
90% of the bitcoins are kept in a multi-signature wallet, co-signed between the operator, BlinkTrade and a trusted third party. In that case only one key is exposed to hacker, and not all at the same time. It also prevents operators from stealing the users bitcoins, and BlinkTrade from stealing from the exchange.
10% of the bitcoins are kept in a hot wallet, and those bitcoins have a colateral deposited by the operator in the cold wallet that is multi-signature, in case of theft only his bitcoins are lost, and not the client’s.
Both cold/hot wallets are public and open to the users, anyone can audit the amount of bitcoins kept by the operators. The operator is forbidden to use another wallet or try to anonymize the transactions. Any user should be able to audit the exchange at any time using the BlockExplorer, please check the exchange’s info for the wallet address.
The operator is STRICTLY forbidden to operate/trade against its customers. Besides being illegal, the operator has access to confidential information that could be used against its clients. The operator’s task is to attract more users, offer the best customer service and process deposits/withdrawals. 
The operator is required to follow local and international laws regarding money laundering and anti-terrorism. If the operators fails to comply with this rules, BlinkTrade can cut the operators access to the server and suspend the operations, not before returning the customers money and bitcoins.
Blinktrade only provides the technology and makes sure the operators are following a specific set of rules. The exchange is managed by local entrepreneurs. The BlinkTrade network is a chain of connected exchanges that use and follow the mentioned rules.

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:27:42
can u buy the coins directly in the app?
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:47:28
well, they say I authorized the transaction. I'm posting the letter I got back from them.
THIS IS THEIR ANSWER!
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:56:29
yeah, i get that... now they are saying that because the transaction came out from my IP i'm responsible for the wires.
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:28:56
how is it that you have so much information about my account and my ip? Perhaps you shouldn't be talking shit without knowing the facts.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:26:41
As far as I know someone logged into my computer using the "back to my mac", got my bank password as I typed it (BOFA doesn't protect the password on the HTML file) - link bellow.
After that the hacker used my account to send money to my account with itbit, which was already registered with Bofa. All he need to do was to get my 2FA, which he did trough the chrome extension that is always open.
All bofa emails were forwarded to trash.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:56:04
clearly i dont mr. smartman! What I'm saying is that it's easy to get my password while I type it.  
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:30:39
thanks for your time, you're clearly smarter than everyone.
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:04:17
I guess this is why bitcoiners are always associated with scams and fraud... you guys are the first one to doubt about everything.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:19:18
not everyone acts like you dude
@_date: 2016-09-14 03:44:37
They probably would use PayPal to finance terrorism. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:02:37
That's not my transaction, its someone elses history.
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:03:43
Hey guys, i have setup this page to teach people about bitcoins and how it can be used for remittances. More than 50 people signed up with my referral and some already purchased over $100 bucks... but no bonus so far! :(
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:02:47
Its amazing how the internet empowers and connects the world!
@_date: 2015-09-29 16:05:10
Im sure thats not the case. Coinbase is just full with crap!
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:09:08
Rosey, thanks for writing me back. I have messaged the support and I'm still waiting for an answer. Let's see what happens. 
My wife used my referral to join and purchase 200 bucks and no bonus.
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:04:22
idk, i think if you're facing death and desperately need the drug, you gonna do whatever it takes to get it.
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:41:58
I guess so, but it's nice to know that people are finding ways to circuveiN the gov. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:57:39
idk, why should they?
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:10:29
Just googled and found out that the drug is significantly cheaper in Brazil
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:41:47
They were instructed to buy more than 100 bucks.
@_date: 2015-09-28 00:34:42
I can seeon my account that people used my link
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:42:06

@_date: 2015-09-25 19:45:38
I'm in touch with some who did. One of my friends also used the referral and bought 300bucks
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:52:39

@_date: 2015-09-29 16:04:32
Same for me. Coinbase sucks!

Brazilians living in the US with US bank accounts. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:54:54

@_date: 2015-09-26 16:54:48
They bitcoins already arrived in their account.
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:32:43
Yeah, I'm blinktrade's CEO and we provide the tech to Urdubit. Right now they are working with the biggest banks in the market.
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:07:13
Actually the price in the US still 750. They promised to bring it down, but I don't think it will come back to 13.50
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:56:00
It's been over 1 hour... same thing happened last week on a large transaction.
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:32:10
sorry to hear that dude
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:06:24
I deleted the account, i'm done with them.
@_date: 2015-11-20 02:19:58

@_date: 2015-11-21 16:38:57

@_date: 2015-10-15 21:11:40
You clearly didn't read the whole thread. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:29:07
Well, i have a website educating people about bitcoins. Explaining on how to buy and sell them in brazil for a profit (remittance). So far more than 50 people registered, bought and sold the coins in Brazil (i have access to the exchange in Brazil) and none of the referrals were paid. 
I just emailed a friend that works there, lets see what they have to say. 
Can you check how much they are offering for your referral, because last week it was 75 and now its 10 bucks. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:09:14
I'm not going to waste my time and answer your message. ;)
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:25:58
Sorry to tell you this, but you lost 12.29% of your money :P
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:52:58
Yeah, i'm not the first person complaining about this. And using it among your friends is just stupid, i'm educating and teaching people about bitcoins... isn't that enough? :)
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:04:08
That's a really good advice, i'm actually planning to use Coinkite's API and a similar setup. 
Would you mind jumping on a quick call to explain in more details your operation?
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:10:03
I actually created another account using a different email, computer, bank account and id (using my wife's) and i'm still not being paid for the referrals.
@_date: 2015-10-03 23:42:18
How can I speak to Josh?
@_date: 2015-11-21 16:34:58
I was close pretty close on my last company. We pioneered the ridesharing market in Brazil with Zaznu. We had over half a million downloads in less than one year and were operating in 6 different cities before Uber arrived in Brazil.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:51:49
Already emailed them... 
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:40:23
Coinbase is def the worst company to work with!
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:14:05
John,can i get you on Skype?
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:01:00
If this is a joke, it is very funny.[2]
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:47:54
There's a startup battle happening right now in the Brazilian Campus Party (like techcrunch disrupt) and the only bitcoin startup is on the TOP3. 
The winner will be featured on many tv outlets including the major news channel in Brazil... this is a great opportunity to disseminate the Bitcoin among Brazilians. 
The voting process takes place inside of an Android/iOS app that can be downloaded here: (this is only necessary to enforce the voting security)
Once you have the app installed, you click on the right menu and go to "STARTUP 360" and than use your camera to scan the QRCODE posted! 
We need your support to spread the Bitcoin word around Brazil!!
THANKS! :)
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:46:07
Well, after coinbase not paying my referrals i decided to create a new account... again they are saying that my referrals are not eligible. WTF COINBASE, YOU SUCK!
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:46:32
I've been trying but their answers are always too vague, i guess i will have to find another service to pay me for my leads ;)
@_date: 2015-11-20 02:30:20
yes, working again but missed the opportunity at 309. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:05:20
Yeah, you're right! 
We are first promoting it to Spanish people. Waiting for that email ;)
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:56:41
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:31:26
I have been in touch with the people that used my referrals, they are brazilians following my blog and website 
@_date: 2015-02-01 07:18:22
thanks mate! we are working hard to make it even better ;)
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:43:33
I sent a few transactions that were confirmed (after 4 confirmations) and the last one for 3.75 Btcs never showed up on my account... How do I get in touch with Finex?
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:37:49
too bad IBM doesn't know MercadoBitcoin's reputation. They have scammed a lot of people in Brazil.
