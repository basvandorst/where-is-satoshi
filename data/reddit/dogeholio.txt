You don't have any "net gain" until you turn the BTC into dollars.
The OP's advice is for people selling BTC at a profit, it is not relevant to a person who is just buying BTC.
The government does not recognize BTC, but if you turn your magic internet money into their dollars you should, by law irrespective of how wrong it is, pay taxes on the gains from your initial investment.

BTC would need to be much, much, higher in per coin fiat value before any nations could trade it in volume without crashing the market.

* Mt. Gox’s customers could find themselves right back where they started, except this time they might be considered equity holders instead of creditors. As equity holders, that would put them dead last in line for repayment. Sunlot, on the other hand, is likely to structure this investment as a leveraged buyout, meaning they would “lend” Mt. Gox the money to make good. This also means that, as creditors, they would go to the head of the line under a repeat bankruptcy scenario.

I wish that were true, but I think he will come out of this with plenty of money in his pocket and he and his top level bitcoin buddies will collude on their next project that will make them wealthier while fleecing the plebs.
They have been robbing the market blind for several years, I see no reason why they would stop now.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:29:17
I will wager that Karpeles comes out of this fairly clean.
I believe there is serious collusion at the top of Bitcoin (more than a little evidence that the top players knew what was up and played the community for fools while they cashed out).
Too many fanatics feel they are personally invested in these bitcoin "leaders" to see those "leaders" are manipulating the bitcoin markets for their future gains and they do not give one damn if the average person loses everything.
Karpeles and his buddies will continue their fleecing, Gox is just a bump in the road for these crooks.

If you join the lawsuit you get whatever you get and that's it.
Even if Gox finds all the missing coins in Karpeles fat rolls you only get what the lawsuit settles for and would be entitled to nothing else.
If you don't join the lawsuit you may never get anything or, in the case of a true miracle, you may get some or all your coins back.
It really is going to depend on what the investigation finds and whether the court decides if Gox can continue as a business.
Personally, I think that lawsuit (and Greene's) will only make money for the lawyers.

You have to be realistic, bitcoin is not federally regulated only because a tiny, tiny, fraction of the populace is involved with it.

First, and foremost, the powers that be do not like crypto currencies and they would happily announce any seizures, as they have done previously.
     they more or less stole money from people all over the world for no reason at all.
And that is exactly why they didn't seize the gox coins.
There has not been a seizure by any official agency, this is just plain old thievery done by common criminals.

* and why karpeles is not in a home arrest until this matter is resolved is beyond me
There is no criminal proceeding against Karpeles (irrespective of his being a criminal) so there is no way to "arrest" him.
The bankruptcy and the lawsuits against him are civil proceedings, the most that can currently happen to him is to lose his assets.
I think Karpeles should be in prison, but unless there is some way to provide evidence he committed a crime he's going to walk away from this mess... :(

Pierce is also involved with KNC which is another huge red flag.
The "Bitcoin foundation" chose this clown knowing that he has tons of baggage that would do nothing for bitcoin but he is another scamming scumbag so he fits right into their little tea party.
