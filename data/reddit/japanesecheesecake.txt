You're begging the question. Where should price be?

I wonder why reddit wont let me post a link to my tshirts on teespring.  I thought it was blocking commercial content or something. Hmm... Anyone?

well said

I'm asian, and you're being a dick.

Core is a project. Blockstream is a business.

Decentralized mining is more profitable because price goes up with user adoption, trust of the protocol, and utility as a peer to peer financial instrument.

Any ideas to make a marketing ploy look scientific? No.

You can't know the "main problem is the fee market" when the only thing we've ever had is price fixing. Price discovery happens if you let it.

Bitcoin is dominated by big players at the moment, especially while we sort this fork nonsense out. Either wait, or use another crypto which is less secure but which may serve your needs.

possibly. also a lot of switching going on, and so technical delays happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:32:21
yes. can you block people from your front door? yes. go somewhere else, or pay for your service.
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:10:38
In what way? Seems Bitcoin remains.

You can't "govern" without violence idiot.

Free speech absolutism is perfectly ethical. Rape is a crime. Photos are evidence. CP hysteria, like all nanny state hysteria, is merely an excuse for total surveillance and censorship capabilities.

You can view the public ledger using a block explorer to see what fees are being accepted. Miners voluntarily process transactions.  They may ignore zero-fee or low-fee transactions. They may not. Take a look at the blockchain and see your chances. Worst case is your transaction is delayed or eventually rejected back to you.

Just read the front page of the sub. And maybe rather than checking in annually, bump it up to monthly.

Every one huh? That's a pretty high fucking horse.
