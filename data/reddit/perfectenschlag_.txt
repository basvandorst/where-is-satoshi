Are you gonna credit the creator?

Props, it’s glorious content

It's free I think but they're accepting applications for the beta. There's a link in this blog post

I started with a Ledger and eventually got a Trezor and I like it better. Grass is always greener

Yes, but minimally. Most people will only make less than a dollar a month, but some of the most connected nodes that are routing a TON of transactions still only make like $25/mo
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:35:57
There are a lot of variables to this, such as when and by how much routing fees increase, that would require a lot of assumptions in order to answer with a reasonable degree of confidence. However, right now probably isn’t the time to be running a node in order to make a profit. It’s about expanding the network, and the stats will show that its expanding like crazy on a weekly basis. Cool stuff to watch happen and be a part of.

Yeah. The Casa Node is a lightning and Bitcoin full node though. I’m a big fan of mine!

Casa for sure. Love mine

Do you have a Nodl? Curious why you choose them over Casa. I have a Casa Node and love it but just never really considered Nodl to begin with
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:00:53
Says here why : 
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:51:45
This puts the nail in the coffin for nodl. Open source was the only thing they had that Casa didn’t. Happy to see Casa making important moves like this

I mean he’s a pretty nice guy, maybe it actually is him?

I’m kidding, OP.

I think you're still thinking of it in the lens of $300 just for the device. Its appeal is for those who want to contribute but aren't technical enough to build their own node. I've got a Casa Node and I have to say it was worth the money to me. It was easy to plug in and get going right away, I'm not worried about how the node looks, and their support team has seriously been so patient and helpful. Sure it might not be worth it to everyone, and yeah I had to save up for it a bit, but it was all worth it to me.
I should also add that it seems ignorant to claim no real R&amp;D went into it.  It seems pretty apparent to me (but probably more so because I've talked to the support team personally and been following the company closely) that a lot of R&amp;D went into it. I'd pay what I did for the easy experience and great support again tomorrow.

Keys.casa is their site. Now it comes with their 2-of-3 multisig, a trezor, and a Faraday bag. Same price as before though, which is cool.
@_date: 2019-04-19 13:18:04
That shouldn't preclude you from empathizing.
@_date: 2019-09-11 03:07:02
Eh no we aren't. Poetic though, I'll give you that.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:13:26
I don't know if this is OC, but either way, I'll offer the flip side of the coin. I think it's cool and its creator should do whatever the fuck they want to.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:44:58
The Casa node is also open source
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:30:25
I love my Casa node. It was more expensive, sure, but so worth it. Great customer support too, which is something often overlooked if you have issues running your own node.
