Why are you two friends?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:37:15
That seems so backwards.

Transfer fees probably, but honestly with this type of growth, locking in the price may save you more money than the saved transfer fees in the long run.

That's very true. I guess i"m just trying to address what his initial fear about it is. He also may not be rational enough or affluent enough currently to hedge his investments as well as he would have been when he placed his money in his retirement account in the first place.

I think the professor was thinking about the money he's already placed into the fund.

Fuck hodling. BUY.

YOU MEAN TO TELL ME JAPANESE NAMES ARE MADE FROM THE SAME CHARACTERS SOMETIMES?!
