And it's up over 500% from this time last year.

Hahahah indeed.

At this point i'd be thrilled to get 20% of my lost coins back. While it's a huge hit compared to the total, it's not small change.

First thing i do when i see a roller coaster meme is check the price. Good god that was a leap! Now let's get our f'ing goxcoins back in our hands!

Hmm, it was saying "sold out" now it's saying they have stock again. How weird.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:01:54
I wonder if they're selling them in batches throughout the day. . .

So day trading between LTC/PPC/BTC/Whatever is fine. . .as long as it never is changed to fiat?
Or can I day trade within mtgox but report once I cash out to my bank?
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:41:27
That's the same conclusion i came to. I figure worst case I break even in a year and have some fun with it.

So what's the problem, I'm still not verified but have done multiple international money transfers into MtGox from my bank account (first one took 48 hours, second one took less than 24 hours.) Only hitch for the time being is I can only pull 100btc/$1000usd out of the account per 24 hour period.
Either way, I'm already in and trading. If you get it set up, shouldn't take more than 48 hours to get your money in to their system.

And now it's saying out of stock again

It's a huge gamble. . .if Avalon gets them delivered on time (given the current rate of network difficulty increase and taking into account all three avalon batches), they should generate approximately what they cost in the first month. Once/If butterfly labs starts shipping, this number could greatly change. If butterfly labs doesn't ship until next fall and Avalon makes their ship dates. . .there's potential for a lot of coins to be mined.

Yup, got one earlier!

Actually at 75btc for the minimum configuration (100btc for the 4 core) it'd be a minimum of 45,000btc. Volume for the last 24 hours is about 46k so yeah they could dump it fairly well. Wouldn't it be more worth their while to bleed that 45k+ into the market (over say the course of a month) and keep the value high?

unfortunately there's not any really quick way. You can do $2000 a day in $500 chunks in cash transfers directly to your wallet using BitInstant. Not sure what their authentication is on individual users but you could probably be a little clever and get all $6k in. However there's a 4% fee to do this and their service has been a little flaky the last few days.
Alternately an international money transfer to MtGox will show up in maybe 2 days (last transfer i did there took less than a day.) You can only transfer 100btc a day so if you want the 4 core system you'll have to get a few more btc in your account once you apply shipping.
Good luck!

No contact at all from them yet, just the order confirmation. The website has been updated and now says batch 2 will ship April 15 and batch 3 will ship May 5. But they started shipping batch 1 Jan 30 and they're still working on it so it's anybody's guess. They claim to have figured out a lot of issues and will get the next 2 batches out much more quickly.
