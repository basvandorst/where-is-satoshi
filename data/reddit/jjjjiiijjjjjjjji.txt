TRON is targeting the entertainment/content industry and their CEO seems to know how to play the role, and well.
So far it landed him a decent size partnership (announced last night) with a decentralized cloud platform. He is actively investing in building the foundation, with the available funds. From what I understand they were looking for that strategic investor/partner to begin a phase in their roadmap for their mission.
I’ve seen startups in tech raise $15-$25M overnight solely on a presentation for a concept/idea for an app, that would take me 3-6 months to develop and I wouldn’t because it’s nothing special. Many of these companies fail to produce a working product, and continue to do another series of funding, and often succeed. 
I’ve seen a company raise $100M in several rounds, and no platform whatsoever but claim they are a platform, a “fake it until you make it”, mentality, and ended partnering with 10K+ big names. It works at the end because they invest that into developers that eventually builds the platform.

Bitcoin is commodity, and you trade BTC against any other coin. They can down play it all they want but BTC isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

I’m talking about investments in general and not losing sleep if I could have made $1M or $100K.
