The gemstone to bitcoin's gold?
@_date: 2016-03-09 15:29:33
How about just using its price?
@_date: 2016-03-27 22:52:43
We aren't at 1 mb.
@_date: 2016-03-27 14:56:52
Except value comes from being good for wealth storage, and there is an enormous network effect in that. Niche transactions and niche users don't matter if they only hold the altcoin for 30 seconds as they make their transaction.
Also, sidechains make all of that possible, and better, by making the altcoins with any niche use redeemable 1-1 for bitcoins.
So no, there will only be one.
@_date: 2016-03-07 18:49:42
People economize. I remember fees from the height of the 2013 bubble. I was less spammy with my transactions--it's easy.
Also, Segwit will ease the pressure a lot so I'm not worried.

You don't know what you're talking about.

Yes, he was one of the only competent guys at the time. But you have not proved that Gavin is "one of the most skilled"! Right now, he, Mike, and Jeff Garzik are broadly irrelevant.


I never said I assume it was a win. Though I do think they waste a lot of everyone's time and get disproportionate credit.
@_date: 2016-03-29 13:55:29
So "Gavin has much experience with bitcoin" is an argument that Gavin is the most talented bitcoin developer? It's not even a question. Anybody who reads bitcoin-dev knows that those guys, especially Gavin and Mike, are irrelevant in bitcoin development.

Technically. There are only 2^160 possible addresses and your computer doesn't have nearly enough memory to store them all.
But your computer cam store more addresses than you'll ever need.
@_date: 2016-03-20 15:27:11
And adding a subreddit to a sidebar is not what allows access.
@_date: 2016-03-29 13:35:48
The dollar doesn't support "such a basic feature" either, genius.
@_date: 2016-03-27 03:22:07


Oldest, yes. Most talented, not at all.
@_date: 2016-03-24 21:32:17


I sometimes wonder...
@_date: 2016-03-31 16:25:54
But Gavin (anointed by Satoshi) said 20 MB is Okey Dokey.
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:03:51


Which is why I think the fee should be decided by the market. If it is, bitcoin will be used by anyone who pays for it.
@_date: 2016-03-31 16:23:58
In what sense is this an "honest question"? This is an exemplary *leading question*.
Bittburger never plays fair.
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:04:31
Are you trying to be dense? You miss the point entirely.
@_date: 2016-03-23 06:12:35
And you're proud of using downvotes as "I disagree" buttons?
@_date: 2016-03-24 13:15:58
Why are you talking about? $100 fees will increase the availability of space in blocks. If fees were even required to be 50 cents right now, people would economize greatly, Coinbase would stop wasting space, and blocks would be 90% empty.
@_date: 2016-03-19 01:21:01
Looks like they have.
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:55:47


That's not true...
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:00:23
And soft-fork segwit is actually a hard-fork, which the developers refuse to admit because Blockstream.
@_date: 2016-03-23 21:24:19
Not sure if the downvotes are from reasonable people who don't detect sarcasm, or blockstream conspiratards who do.
@_date: 2016-03-22 14:40:00
Specifically what advice is bad?
@_date: 2016-03-28 14:20:41
Not going to mention the [downvote armies]( who selectively attack only people who disagree with your FUD?
Okey dokey.
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:25:32
You responded to *me*. *I'm* the OP.
@_date: 2016-03-10 06:29:46


As in?


Rich people use water and poor people use water. It is easy to "compete" with them for water, as it turns out.
@_date: 2016-03-10 00:13:33


This is nonsense. Do you microecon?


Lightning network will reduce fees, as will segwit.
But you should know that there is a difference between regulated corporations *using* bitcoin and bitcoin *being* a regulated corporation. If bitcoin is decentralized, the latter will not happen.
@_date: 2016-03-12 16:07:50
By that logic, you should always ever buy bitcoin will all of your money ever.
@_date: 2016-03-31 22:40:21
Hey, how about you read the paper.
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:35:57
Because the *tx price at which supply is full* is relevant.
If you've been around bitcoin for a while you should know that elementary fact.
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:27:40


No, it still is. The supply curve is vertical. The market sets the price where the demand curve intersects it.


It sounds like you don't know what a decentralized network is.
@_date: 2016-03-27 14:47:25


Good, well-reasoned argument.
@_date: 2016-03-23 06:14:33


It was actually pretty explicit.
@_date: 2016-03-23 06:13:54
Jesus Christ. Do you just go through his history and downvote him?
@_date: 2016-03-29 13:43:04
Hah, thanks.
@_date: 2016-03-27 18:30:23
If you think you can do it more quickly, contact blockstream [here](
@_date: 2016-03-31 22:39:40
And with that philosophy, bitcoin will be regulated out of existence.
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:02:14
Transactions that don't pay enough to get included not getting included?
@_date: 2016-03-13 20:58:53


It sounded to me like you're the one who brought up the present-value of the $50,000 worth of donated bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-03-23 21:31:15


*Kind of*, sure. But it's not totally meaningless. Bitcoin is decentralized in communication, but it ultimately relies on consensus of a majority which defines whether your transaction has been received or not.
IMO, the analogy between "downtime" in a typical server would be orphaned chains or other history-rewrites.
@_date: 2016-03-23 16:57:07


It will take on the order of 10x as long as it took to reach four nines.
@_date: 2016-03-23 14:56:48


This is how I know you probably don't have the capacity to understand the block size debate. Literally *all* data must be interpreted with implicit or explicit assumptions.
It's obvious your bias has compromised your critical thinking.
@_date: 2016-03-14 00:23:42


No, it's good for infinite transactions. Although for maximum privacy you may want to change addresses often.
@_date: 2016-03-11 22:05:24
I love Paul, but keep in mind that this analysis only applies when you're talking about using PoS to distribute coins/rewards: the total amount spent on mining will be equal in both cases.
It doesn't say anything about whether PoS can be "cheaper" than PoW in terms of security per dollar spent. That analysis is *much* harder to do, and probably impossible as of now. "Security" isn't really well defined.
@_date: 2016-03-23 16:58:29
Do short blocks count as extra uptime?
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:57:55
If the block size rose, you might have to pay *less* to spam the network.
RBF fixes this problem, anyhow. It allows a fee market to function.
@_date: 2016-03-27 14:49:00


If you thought a broadcast network would ever be competitive to a centralized one, you got into bitcoin for the wrong reasons.
All of your other points are wrong, by the way.
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:23:45


And that's the problem, isn't it?
It is simple impossible for everyone to record all of their transactions on bitcoin. Impossible.
@_date: 2016-03-07 18:10:24
Who is that guy at the end?
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:02:11
You have cause and effect backwards. If $100 is the effect, then yes, blocks will be full.
@_date: 2016-03-25 05:08:46
I agree, except...


The flow rate of goods and services doesn't change if only the velocity changes. The prices simply rise and more dollars or btc are used in each transaction.
@_date: 2016-03-28 14:24:38


Oh, you don't know what a sidechain is. That explains it.
@_date: 2016-03-24 21:30:59
You're defining "inflation rate" using different metrics. The dollar uses CPI, while bitcoiners typically use the growth rate of the quantity of money.
@_date: 2016-03-19 01:22:05
So how is removing the subreddit entirely not censorship?
Also, looks like they have in their sidebar. Has anybody even posted there in the past month?
