If you're looking for pure JS you'll have to rebuild your website in node.js. The problem is all bitcoin code has to be serverside for security. Can't have users nosing around in transaction code.

Still, off topic terrorists or not. This stuff is meant for or at best. The whole point of subreddits is diversifying between debates and interests.

Keep in mind this might be a ruse just for delays. This is gix. They can't be trusted.

Can we stay on topic? The Gaza conflict has almost nothing to do with bitcoin so let's not discuss it in Thanks.

That is problem number one right there. You guys take this way too seriously. The fact you prioritize a high price means you just want to exchange it to dollars and live off your internet coin profit. You're talking of adoption rate, not "huhuhu Imma get rich and drink tons o' hooch with Cletus".

It's a value floor. Artificial price fixing at its best. Some whale with a 1.4 M dollar buy order.

i dont wanna be the bad guy but this looks like gender based karma whoring... besides, "It has taken over our lives, but I love it!", could you please explain?
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:36:25
I'm gonna tip you. Just not here, It draws away my neutrality.

Social interaction really seems to be your thing.

Try dogecoin if you'd like to try cryptocurrency. It's cheaper and much friendlier than this one.

Internet scammers hate him.
