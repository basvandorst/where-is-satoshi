**bigger blocks, more fees**
why raising the block limit increases network security
Bitcoin can be used by many groups of users. For our model, 
let's assume three groups:
LARGE TRANSACTIONS: I'll pay up to 0.002 BTC per transaction.
SMALL TRANSACTIONS: I'll pay up to 0.001 BTC per transaction.
MICRO TRANSACTIONS: I'll pay up to 0.00001 BTC per transaction.
Small blocks CAN RESULT IN LESS FEE COMPETITION
Smaller blocks initially results in more fee competition, making fees higher. This limits the use cases of bitcoin, resulting in less users. Because there are less users, this actually decreases fee competition!
If small transaction makers try to use bitcoin, they will raise fees beyond what they're willing to pay. Thus, fees should naturally converge at 0.001 BTC per transaction.
    Large: 0.001    0.001    0.001    0.001    0.001
    Small: TRANSACTIONS ARE PRICED OUT
    Micro: TRANSACTIONS ARE PRICED OUT
    Total: 0.005 BTC
Medium sized blocks result in the most fees
By allowing bigger blocks, small transaction users can now use bitcoin and will compete for the block space. Because there is more competition, same users will pay more than the minimum market fee just to ensure their transaction will get into the next block.
    Large: 0.002    0.002    0.0006    0.0006    0.0006
    Small: 0.001    0.0005   0.0005    0.0005    0.0005
    Micro: TRANSACTIONS ARE PRICED OUT
    Total: 0.0088 BTC
∞ cap
Large blocks will still result in the most fees
Even if there is no hard limit on the block size, miners are profit seeking and will soft-cap their blocks and have fee policies that ensure they make the most in fees. They won't allow tiny transactions, because larger blocks orphan more and hence have a cost.
    Large: 0.002    0.002    0.0006    0.0006    0.0006
    Small: 0.001    0.0005   0.0005    0.0005    0.0005
    Micro: MINERS ARE PROFIT SEEKING AND WILL REFUSE TO MINE MICRO TRANSACTIONS, IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE[sic] FEES EARNED. 
    Total: 0.0088 BTC
It's time to scale bitcoin.

They sell books with one-time use vouchers to access online content.
If a class requires you to access the online content, you are forced to buy a new book.
Total scam.

It's not your Bitcoin until you control the private key.

In my small town, I've seen four instances of this in the past month. 
Makes me think I should start selling on Localbitcoins again...

Too many people play that don't plan to pay. I don't know how you solve this while remaining decentralized, but if you figure it out I'd be interested!

Hi Dad.

I have some friends in Slovenia, they know of Bitcoin but I don't think they want to use it for some reason.
A few months ago they asked me to ship them a small item, which I did. I didn't really expect anything in return, but later they sent me about 10 Euro in various slovenia coins. It was a nice gesture, but as I am in the US I don't have much use for Euros. I had asked them about Bitcoin before, and they definitely knew what it was. 
I started hiding the Euro coins for people to find.

1) Declare the internet as a haven for pedophiles, attempt to discourage it's use. Continue this for years, routinely breaking up massive pedophile rings which of course only existed because of the internet. After some time, outlaw internet use for everyone except large corporations. For the children.
2) Maybe you could try embracing Bitcoin, but declare that it is not legal to spend any BTC not verified by the state. Then you create some type of colored-coin system, ignoring the vast majority of BTC in existence in favor of the few BTC verified and released by the government. Imprison anyone caught spending non-verified coins on the grounds that they are supporting terrorists.
3) Over generations, sedate citizens using a combination of chemicals and simple entertainment. Dissuade the individual from thinking for themselves, and indoctrinate them to obey authority by gradually dismantling education systems. Instill a feeling of superiority in the masses using patriotism. Outlaw any chemical which may disrupt this process. Outlaw Bitcoin mostly as a formality, as no-one would have used it anyway.
I don't really think any of these would work though, tbh.
