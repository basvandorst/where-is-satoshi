Say, tomorrow, a straw man appears.

I think you've given an ok argument against anti-statism (aka 'anarcho'-capitalism).
But the mere disappearance of the state is not what anarchists mean by anarchy. There would still be the hierarchies of capitalism, patriarchy, racism, etc. When those are all abolished, that might be anarchy, but it's a long term goal that's not going to happen tomorrow or maybe ever.

Hey how's it going? I can think of some obvious questions:
For a while there was some mystery IP that was finding blocks but not processing transactions. Do you know anything about that or have any opinion on it? How many bots do you have? Are they coordinated? About how often do they hit? Do you give donations? haha 1BMtXAoJhwJyhAhE9CnvFe6Th41rd7dtbL

You cut off the rest of that wikipedia definition:


[Anarchism is more than anti-statism](


Cooperation directly conflicts with the exploitative nature of capitalism.
And there's nothing 'voluntary' about being born into a life of poverty and then 'choosing' between death or exploitation.
