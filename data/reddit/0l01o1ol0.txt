What software are you using to do these analysis?
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:35:36
Sorry if this is only tangentically related. After the recent Truecrypt shenanigans, I'm curious if anyone knows of ways for developers to develop software and distribute it to the general public anonymously. As in, even if the government wanted to find you, they'd have to go through a lot more hoops than a subpeona or NSL to sourceforge.
A dev could develop things on a repository in an onion network, I suppose, but then the general public won't be able to get to it.
Anyone know of software dev sites like sourceforge, which has a public web front for general public use, and also a onion routed back access for devs?

What European state allows police to take all property of a person arrested for drugs before conviction, and lets the police keep it?
Or has the majority of those in prison due to nonviolent drug offenses?
Or the majority of convictions based on plea bargaining?

Except that more informed people are saying that Wikileaks or Assange are the more likely targets, and the wild speculation of threw money at Snowden instead of Wikileaks.

Note that I went and asked about it [here]( and here are the top comments:








TL;DR: has fantasies of eebil gubmint going after Snowden, so they come up with the most far-reaching, uninformed interpretation of an order, and throws bitcoin at Snowden instead of Wikileaks or Assange who might be a more likely target.
@_date: 2015-04-03 04:31:12
No. Julian and Kim maybe, but Snowden is a US citizen who was formally charged with a crime. He would not be on the State Dept.'s sanctions list.


He had his passport revoked, not the same thing.

An interesting thought is that the NSA likely knows who Satoshi is, unless he went to very extreme lengths to hide his tracks in his postings on forums and mailing lists.

He's still in Japan, right? So he's afraid to go back to the US because he'd be prosecuted or disappeared.... or maybe he's actually DPR, as Ulbrecht's defense claims.... and the Japanese authories are being told multiple stories from different US agencies, so they have no idea what to do...
fuck it, nothing's too crazy anymore.

If I'm reading p41-43 right, they arrested a drug dealer with admin privileges on SR on Jan. 17th, on Jan. 25th he showed them how to use SR, and literally the same day thefts occurred at SR traced to the admin's account.
Then DPR's internal investigation fingered the admin as the culprit(not knowing he had been captured by the feds), he contacted the corrupt fed's cover ID(not knowing it was a fed) to discuss the theft by the admin, and the corrupt fed's supervisors saw it and asked the admin they captured if he did the thefts(which he denied)

I've met people with a visceral distrust of Bitcoin, from its association with scammers, hackers, identity thieves, drug dealers, anarcho capitalists, Objectivists, gun runners, libertarians and people who think cyberpunk dystopias are supposed to be a good thing.
Basically, a lot of people are pushing Bitcoin with the mantra of "We can destroy government with this!" so anyone who opposes the idea of free market anarchism goes against it.

There was a thread yesterday about r/buttcoin and why people would hate Bitcoin. I think this comic sums it up nicely, they're not disputing the underlying technology, they're put off by the kind of people that tend to push Bitcoin the hardest.
[See also this Radiolab episode about Darkode]( where they interview some people from Coinbase about Bitcoin in the course of doing a story about a hacking group.

I think you are the one missing his point. I used the internet in the Trumpet Winsock days of the '90s through today. The technologies you listed, "datagrams, sliding windows, spanning tree, bgp, ospf, dns, ntp" are things that even in those days were things only an administrator would have to deal with setting up, and ordinary users could just use the "customer-facing" part of those technologies, or have it be done without their interaction.
DNS is the only one that people would seriously even interact with, and its whole purpose was to make things simpler for the users.
And the simpler things got, the more users the internet got. It's a pretty simple and applicable analogy.

IDK, I was impressed how quickly they got major corporations like Mastercard to stop accepting payments for Wikileaks when the State Dept. cables were leaked.
Of course I doubt they see Bitcoin in the same way, but if more people on their enemies list start using it, maybe they will start taking more cooercive measures.
A few years ago I knew about NSA stuff like Echelon but I still would have considered the stuff from the Snowden leaks beyond believable, like intercepting Cisco routers in the mail to install backdoors.
