Imagine what would happen if ANY of thousands institutions will make a relatively small bet on Bitcoin. And it's just a matter of time.

The Bitcoin ETF is what we all need. Wish them good luck.

A lot of people would like to use this service. The main question is if VISA and Mastercard will be happy have this kind of service.

BTC/USD 130 on Monday
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:29:17
It is 100 USD now, because the economy is 10 times bigger now. Bitcoin price is the tool that allows to scale money supply here.

It's impossible to fund BTC-E account with SEPA or SWIFT. It's price was always lower than on MtGox.

Very well done!

Are you sure about "newest update"? I don't see any updates pending and my version allows to make transfers. (Non-US App Store)
@_date: 2013-07-04 04:28:42
It will rebound soon. Fundamentals are stronger then volatility.

Guys are just tied, will rebound very soon.
@_date: 2013-07-01 05:59:37
European Union countries only. I think it's great if we have lots of regional exchanges like this one instead of monsters like MtGox. The Bitcoin economy will be more stable in this case.
@_date: 2013-07-01 06:26:57
Yeah, imo each country with large population, like Australia, should have it's own local Bitcoin exchange, with local license.

No demo, but cool spreads, even for BTC
@_date: 2013-07-02 01:45:55
This is the biggest news on Bitcoin from it's inception.  
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:25:44
And VISA's economy is 30 000 times bigger then current Bitcoin economy. The party is just started. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:27:45
4 dollars will never happen, cause already  we will buy entire emission. And we are not alone.
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:00:52
No point, bullshit. 
More funds =&gt; more value =&gt; more supporters =&gt; more publicity =&gt; more adopters 
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:35:18
100k+ imo. I've been reading this reddit without subscribing for more then a year. And all my friends do the same. Also more the 1 million Bitcoin addresses are used monthly (yes, discounting that 80-90% of them are used by the same people)
@_date: 2013-06-30 08:46:08
Very good news in fact.
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:42:27
Nice one! Please add 
@_date: 2013-05-24 11:49:06
Too close to this one 
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:15:45

@_date: 2013-07-02 04:20:16
Absolute bullshit.
