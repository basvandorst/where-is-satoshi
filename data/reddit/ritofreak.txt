I've been searching r/bitcoin for hours now looking for the answer to this.  
The answer is noone really knows. When BTC hit like 12k i thought ''oh, it will dip now and then i'll buy''. Guess where it is now? I don't think anyone predicted this insane rise. And noone can predict what happens next

It will all be ok my dude. I know you’re nervous, but the best thing you can do right now is to just relax and not think about your coin too much. Try to do something that keeps your mind away, and check in maybe once a day.  
I know that it’s not 100% sure that BTC will crash and be worth nothing tomorrow, but really, if you’re afraid that will happen then there was no point in buying at all.  
You bought because you had faith. You trust that Bitcoin’s price will rise, and you know what? So do i, and almost everyone on this sub too.  
Don’t be scared if BTC falls to $10k-12k. It’s normal. You bought at all time high, ofcourse it’s going to go down quite a bit. But remember, after It falls, it always reaches a new all time high! Your bitcoin will be worth so much if you just stop thinking about it, keep your faith and hold on to it!!!  
I bought at $5.5k JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO thinking i was buying too high and watched it drop down, guess where it is now?  
If you still feel nervous, look up a bitcoin chart and set it on /All time. Look at how how always after it falls, it reaches a new high, falls a bit and then reaches a new high again.  
I’m saying this because i don’t want you to lose your money. I want you to have that great feeling of seeing as BTC rises and know you just made a nice stack of bucks!! I also know how psychologically painful bitcoin can be. Just don’t think about it so much.  
PS. There’s also a big chance that soon BTC will never go below $17k again in a very very very very long time!

Pure lack of knowledge, i still don’t understand how bitcoin could lose all it’s value. Please inform me of what could happen?

As a kid, I'm going to be honest. I don't know how old your kids are, but i know for myself atleast, i would much rather have my parents keep their money so that they will have much more in a couple years than a playstation right now.  
No hate, just my opinion.
