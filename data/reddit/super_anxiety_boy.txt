You did not use a metaphor. You don't understand what that is, which does not bode well. 
You used shoddy analogies, and they were not effective because you're making false equivalencies. 
What I mean about you being up your ass is that you're arguing through nothing but idealism from a standpoint of moral absolutism. 
The world is not going to change because you're arguing something is immoral. Reality is indifferent to it.  Moral relativism is a thing which exists and you literally posted an argument for it. 
Your focus on "proving taxation is theft" as if it defeats the concept of taxation is childlike. 
Again, this is not a vacuum. This is a society. You are able to leave your house and drive on the roads to supermarkets stocked with produce from across the country because of the efforts of hundreds of thousands of other people. 
Explain to me how making use of that infrastructure without paying for it isn't theft. 
I'm handling your argument, it fits neatly in my palm. You're constantly deflecting and throwing irrelevant asides because you don't actually have an alternative to a centralized government. 
Here's what I need answered: explain to me how you would build roads between two municipalities without 1. Forming **governing bodies** to oversee the construction, 2. **Collecting revenue** and 3. The use of **eminent domain**
Then explain how you would do the same thing between two states.

Dude, you are so far up your own ass it's ridiculous. 
You're all "false equivalency this" and "false equivalency that; providing infrastructure for a society is the same as making computers."
This is the real world, not a conceptual vacuum. You want to argue that taxation is the textbook definition of theft? Fine, I'll give it to you. 
Taxation is theft. What's the alternative?
