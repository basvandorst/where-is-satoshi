Yes that was my concern as well, it seems that making a protocol that is tolerant to such levels of faultiness (malignant third parties) is not yet feasible if not impossible, though I did hope that maybe somebody knew a way to circumvent the "trust" part and just assume that all output values might be tampered with and still have consensus on a final value.

But does licensing affect asian markets? Where bitcoin use is much bigger and most of the crash is happening? (chinese exchanges)

Well using that logic it is much more likely that it is the industrial miners themselves who are dumping their coins. This would make a lot of people pull the plug and thus substantially increase their profits. Im just saying that using your logic (and I agree by the way) it is the big miners that are driving the price down in order to monopolize the market.

Cartels are made with every limited commodity production, the companies that have the lowest cost of production bully other companies out of the market. I just wanted to know if anyone thought that was the case and if so how could we verify it or even better, what the implications are.
