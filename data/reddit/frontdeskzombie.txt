That is more what I'm looking for. A small hobby that will eventually pay for itself. I doubt i'll get anywhere near "200 dollars free spending cash a month" but 50-100 a month somewhere down the line would be nice.

Just to clarify; that machine is for BTC mining not alt coins; right?
or is my noobiness showing?

Have you even BEEN a new reddit user? The search feature is hard to navigate sometimes; and is usually full of outdated information.

Don't be an asshat SteakJunky.
These gentleman helped me out immensely and gave me a responsive CONVERSATION on bitcoins.

Hah I fully understand the angst; I've been there circa 1996 gamefaqs.com forums. 
Where are these people buying these rigs retail? I can only seem to find some decently priced used rigs off ebay etc.
My power bill right now comes at .03 cents per KW/H (unless i'm reading my bill wrong.) (This is of course w/o a $7 fee and the taxes) so in my opinion that's pretty decently priced.
I'm not more concerned with the acquisition of coins just yet; per se, but more of an aquire/cash in semi-instantly situation. 
(Barring percentile transaction fees that require me to 'save up' coins)

Wow thanks. I didn't even realize that and were separated. I'm assuming that this subreddit is for discussion of the actual coin, coin prices, and coin news then?

I understand that mining isn't for novices; but everyone has to start up somewhere.
What would be a good $ amount for a startup farm; and where should I point my reading glasses towards for information/guides?
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:36:31
What would be a good starting number if I wanted to start my own farm; one machine at a time?
Would BTC be the wrong currency for me to be investing in if I'm wanting to mine?
