you know if you take any random time frame of a couple of weeks from 2013 to 2017 you have a very high chance of getting a time frame where bitcoin has risen by whatever amount. this kind of analysis doesnt really mean anything.

I definitely see a time in which inexperienced short/midterm traders are gonna have a very hard time doing anything except losing money in the btc market.
Probably gonna be relatively volatile for some extened period of time since volume is basically dead in the big markets.

none of these are true   **��**

you should wait for btc to hit 1k if you really want to buy it as a "store of value  �� "
but honestly buying bitcoin is probably the most braindead thing you can do with your money
cmon guys hit me with ur downvotes i wanna see atleast 10 downvotes ��

it won't or atleast the chances are negligibly small... bitcoin is purely a gambling money sink
the problem is in no way can u every convince one of these people of this because they're so stuck up their own ass that they can't even think of the possibility that they might be wrong
and that their "currency" is only being to 99.9% mainly used as a gambling device by rich first world countries where there are no reasons to have or use it in the first place.
the ethereum project on the other hand even though it's also being abused as massive gambling device has a much higher chance of being useful.
and these people touting crazy values are absolute idiots who don't even realize that there exist people stupider than than they, who will listen to them and buy with credit or with way too much % of their money "because moon" and in the end ruin their lifes because they have no idea what they're doing.

thats just a terrible headline to what i assume is a terrible news site im not even going to click the link
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:03:24
please enlighten me... how does war work?
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:15:45
your view is very pessimistic (of course history teaches you to be pessimistic), while i agree that a war/preemptive strike/whatever you wanna call it especially with trump as president isn't unlikely at all. the fact that north korea is open to talks for freezing nuclear weapon developement and even talks of some kind of paradise-like reunion(lol) makes a preemptive strike/war scenario less likely if you like it or not
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:15:24
right now bitcoin is still mostly speculation and north korean war is a massively speculative event
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:10:54
well any shorters still are right in their position - it's still down from 20k when futures trading started ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:37:38
now im not saying that bitcoin will keep dropping in price it might as well go higher from here im just saying that the drop ure seeing a couple of hours ago is most likely due to the news
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:48:02
so youre saying its either its either gonna go up down or sideways? interesting
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:47:53
there are no alternatives.
