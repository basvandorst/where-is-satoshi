Right now, there is a mining subsidy. It's enough to keep miners paid for a while. In a few years, that will be gone, and the price of a transaction must go up.
It's smarter to grow now and raise the limit while the tx price is subsidized by the block reward, because when that's gone, fees must go up to make up for the lost reward. 
If you want to keep security constant, you keep the *net* block value constant. EG 25BTC reward + 0 fees, 12.5BTC reward + 12.5BTC fees, 0 reward, 25 BTC fees, it would be best for everyone to have to cover 25BTC in fees over 10MB of txns than 1MB of txns.
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:11:44
Bigger blocks -&gt; more tx per block -&gt; more total fees per block
Or if you think of mining fees economically as a "tax", more commerce leads to more taxes.
If we limit blocks to 1MB, the network won't grow as much as it could. Prematurely limiting block size reduces future mining fees when the block limit could be 10MB and there would be more fees to make on 10x the transaction volume.

It's not redundant, the "real innovation..." argument is just like, your opinion, man.
The other "real innovation" of the blockchain is the shared ledger, which, let me tell you, is not "redundant" to international asset book-keeping system, but is so redundant as to make it obsolete. It is cheaper, more transparent, and effective than the establishment.
The blockchain is straight up *better* than the signed "debt tokens" we have floating around today. What's easier to forge and get away with: a paper signature, or 256 bits of a computationally sound cryptographic hash.

Insider trading is not a problem that needs to be addressed directly. It's a consequence of corrupt organizations. You prevent the bad effects of insider trading with transparency - press, social media, stakeholder demand for information, etc. With the Gox press release, it had already hit the fan hours before the insider trade. 
At this point insider trading is the least of it compared to the fraud, as funny business has clearly been going on at Gox for months as the price disparity showed capital was not able to flow through the exchange.

Valid points that measurables visible to the blockchain are not sufficient to really do elastic money. I understand that the money is lent and not just given, but when you are lending at 0.25% for 10 years, lower than the rate of asset inflation, it basically _is_ free money. Free money that flows right to TPTB and the TBTF.
Some human authority would be necessary for issuance of high quality elastic money, however I disagree that it is necessarily a "central" authority as in a central bank or government. Private banks could perform the same function with debt _or_ asset-backed instruments just as well (the money would obviously still be a debt instrument itself). Imagine cryptographic gold bonds/certificates circulating in the ecosystem, or other currencies redeemable for some real-world value.
Trusting the issuance and creation of money to a single root authority has always been a problem and *always* been exploited by the people in control. That's the real problem that needs to be solved.

Two reasons why you should not worry:
1) Bitcoin is not an instrument regulated by the SEC. It is not included under the terms of your dad's contract. Have fun trading and mining.
2) You should also research what it means to perform insider trading. Insider trading is when you trade based on privileged information you have obtained as an officer of a corporation. Unless you somehow find out that your dad's company is going to make a big move on bitcoin ahead of everyone else, there's no way you could even possibly commit insider trading. 
3) As I said before, bitcoin is not a legally considered a 'security,' 'note', 'stock', 'bond', a 'currency', or any other type of financial instrument under existing securities and exchange law. Insider trading rules can not be applied unless the law changes. (source:

It's some twisted logic when you talk about negative interest rates. The article is not very helpful.


I understand what you are saying, but the propensity to spend earlier with a deflationary money only applies when you are using borrowed money. If it's savings, you are going to have a propensity to hold your money.
Lending a deflationary currency is a negative offset to the loan's stipulated interest rate, it requires charging higher nominal interest rates to lend at a profit.
This talk sounds very much about spinning the wheels of the current debt-loaded system, and keeping people parting with their money quickly, instead of encouraging healthy savings.

Inflation can't be considered as a transaction fee  because it affects all holders proportionally, regardless of their transacting activity. Furthermore, it would be more appropriately considered a cost of bitcoin, but not a fee, since the word fee has a specific legal meaning associated with an obligation of one party to pay or submit directly to another for some privilege. A transaction fee fits the historical definition, but calling a block reward an "implied fee" does not fit the meaning of the word fee. It is a cost.

If you don't think information (numbers being digital information) can be considered property, or otherwise 'owned,' you must be a teenager. Ignoring state-instituted copyright &amp; IP law, inasmuch as you may maintain and enforce the privilege of a piece of information, you would be considered to have ownership of it.
Now if you published your private key for the world to know, you just abandoned ownership. My point is that ownership does not have to be a legal concept, it is a consequence of reality. Just like DPR still owns 144,000 BTC despite the feds' best efforts.
The laws and courts happen to adhere specific principles and rules for testing ownership, and the guy in this case definitely has a good ownership claim to the bitcoin under existing law.

Oh gosh, more of you idiotic central planners who think they have the whole fractal economy figured out. The blockchain can measure the velocity of money and adjust mining difficulties based on that. I'm sure there are more creative approaches to elastic supply.
Obviously new money going to the miners is a horrible idea compared to new money going to politically-connected pockets and TBTF banks. Yeah. We didn't think of that. Miners will just sit on their new money and do nothing with it. In no way will they have any pressure to spend the new money before it enters the market and prices adjust to the escalated money supply. They definitely won't lend their new money or reinvest it in any way either. And nobody will raise new capital to compete with the miners getting the fresh new money during economic expansions. We need the central authority to handle it all for our own benefit. Come back with some common sense.

You're missing the finer points. Making your "mark" is often customary when, for example, the person is illiterate, unable to sign, or in the case of credit card receipts, just feels like scribbling something resembling a signature.
There is more to forming a contract than mere ink on paper.
The elements of a contract include
1) Offer
2) _Unconditioned_ acceptance 
2) Consideration 
Signing "Refused" or "No thanks" would not be considered acceptance by any magistrate. 
You can also modify the contract and sign it (by striking out parts of the contract or adding your own terms), and then you are back to step 1, the offer, and the other party who originally presented the agreement has the onus to accept (and sign) it.

Thanks, Paul Krugman's reddit account.

If the secret service decides to follow the chain and finds you, you're fucked. I wouldn't be surprised if they went so far to threaten paper terrorism charges.

They didn't raise dollars. They raised BTC and holding it shows projects confidence in the crypto economy. If they had chosen Euros they would be nearly equally in the hole.

Yeah, what kind of idiot thinks $100,000,000.00 is a lot of money! Who could make anything with less than $500,000,000.00!

What he's saying is not that Counterparty lacks a consensus mechanism, but that the security of it's consensus does not grow in proportion with bitcoin. It depends on the much smaller subset of nodes running Counterparty.

Sounds like disinfo. Why would they drop 100 mil into mining hardware?
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:23:47
Nice one.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:28:55
No, you pay to use the API.

No, you do the DDOS using the Tor network.
You know, that's actually quite a brilliant way to map Tor.
DDOS the target with a pulse from all of your nodes, and if you control enough nodes to have one close or adjacent to the target, the nodes you control will indicate their network distance to the target node by the measurement of the pulse being routed through that particular node. Then you can build a heat map of where the target is in Tor space, and then whichever node is the 'hottest' from the pulse, whichever real IP address it forwarded the pulse traffic to is the suspect target node.

Except for, you know, funding.

You reduced global demand for RMB, which lowers the aggregate purchasing power (value) of the currency. The issuers of RMB won't be pleased with that.

Unsubscribing until you return to an uncensored policy. Only off-topic or posts with extremely foul content have grounds for moderation in this open forum.

In his defense, I do not believe he is suggesting that bitcoin trading = money laundering, but that trading bitcoin in volume has a footprint similar to money laundering, so steps to avoid money laundering red flags would also be steps to avoid false flags from legitimate bitcoin trading.

It looks like the_promise_ to pay bitcoin is the security alleged. That they trying to classify that as a debt instrument (security), measured in legal tender $$. 
I don't think bitcoin itself should be classified as a security however, so far legally just 'value'.

It is illegal to _require_ anything other than US dollars for fulfillment of a debt. You may _accept_ anything you like.

You do realize that a primary objective of the Fed is to maintain full employment nationwide?
You might want to consider the implications of that policy.

For the most part it is HTML5 based, so the source for the web service is closed.
The design for enhanced security features includes client-side software though, which will be open sourced for transparency purposes, although it is not planned for release with the first beta.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:43:22
You're right, my apologies. Now that I think of it, all it would take is a request to an IP-routed server with a posted user/session id, and they not only have your IP address, but a link to your identity on the site.
@_date: 2013-09-26 18:09:24
I am working on a Dropbox-like service with enhanced security and plans to build Bitcoin as the initial payment mechanism. For anyone interested, I can provide more info and invite you to the beta release.

Except, the state lacks the means to seize BTC like they can seize USD. Unless they are able to link them to a personal identity, the BTC are safe, otherwise the person faces prison anyways.

Here's a network graph:
    0.       [    target.onion    ]   
            /           |          \
    1. [NSA A]-----[anon node]    [NSA node B]
         |    \          \          |
    2. [NSA C] [anon]--[NSA D]---[NSA E]
                           /  \    |
    3.               [NSA F]   [NSA G]
All nodes know the IP addresses of their adjacent nodes, but they do not know if one of their adjacent nodes is the attack target node.
Each NSA node simultaneously sends a packet to the hidden.onion node. The packets will route through other nodes (in any order) until they reach the destination node. 
The sum of the pulse traffic going through target-adjacent nodes must = the sum of the initial pulse traffic generated, assuming no packet loss AND no cycles in the route.
From that axiom, you can deduce that an increased level of detected pulse traffic on a node correlates with an increased probability that the node is adjacent to the target node.
If you take the highest probability nodes from that result, and find that they all share a common neighbor, there is your suspect for the target node. Since the suspect is a neighbor of a controlled node, you also have it's IPv4 address.

This is the law they are claiming jurisdiction under:
[15 USC § 77b - Definitions](




@_date: 2013-07-24 03:02:15


The bigger worry is the government asserting the _de facto_ presumption in the eyes of the public that bitcoin represents a legal 'security' or 'currency'. IMO fraud is a given, but the case would establish precedent for applying new statutory definitions and rules. 
Here is the district court filing:
[SEC v. Shavers]( 


1. This case involves fraudulent offers and sales of *securities* by Shavers and 
BTCST, a Bitcoin-denominated Ponzi scheme founded and operated by Shavers.

How about the 'law' of supply and demand


For an instant, perhaps. But the rest of the market would have to agree with them for any sustained change in value.
@_date: 2013-01-30 04:04:03
Wrong question. Is bitcoin a currency? Legally speaking, it is not. See the paper by Yale law student Ruben Grinberg.
@_date: 2013-10-02 03:32:16
Not really, if it increased use of better forms of currency.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:11:03
Well, they aren't going to get any IP addresses, considering it's an onion node.
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:53:43
I believe he is referring to the general lawlessness of the government. The nation of men we have, rather than the nation of law we were designed to have.
