You are responsible for figuring out how much you owe, what forms to file, etc. If you do nothing the first notice you'll get is when they come after you for tax evasion.
This sounds a little harsh but it is the way it works. You owe income taxes on cryptos you mine or are paid, and you owe capital gains tax on any gains you realize by selling, minus the losses you made on other sales or trades. Hopefully you can connect with someone with experience in this in your area.

I've wondering for a while - are generation/coinbase transactions an exception to the no address reuse rule? 
Edit: genuinely curious because I can't see why they would be an exception but then how should I submit work to eligius? Or is the minimum payout threshold + dumping to other addresses immediately the solution to that?

Discernment of effective censorship is one of those times to remember that absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence - it is *censorship* after all ;)
Unless you mean out-of-band evidence has been sought and not found in which case I defer.

Also, you need to be filing taxes each year you earn money - the taxes taken out of past paychecks may have been too much or too little, and the IRS expects you to settle up or apply for the refund. They won't refund you automatically if you've overpaid or bill you if you've underpaid -- it's all on you to figure out.

Yeah, that's totally the idea. I figure it must have been looked at before (by satoshi, if no one else) - but haven't seen it come up during the current spam/block size discussion.

So in the world gasoline is a major thing are people just going to accept the price per gallon is a random number that changes day to day?
The fact the price can change with factors totally out of the drivers' control and are not in any way predictable (over the timeframes vehicle financing covers) seems like a really large problem. Are people just supposed to accept that the cost of driving can randomly change?

Fair argument. Gasoline's ubiquity and perceived necessity does increase acceptance of price volatility.

luke-jr's "most likely" can be quantified --   for a present-conditions example -- if appropriate for the conversation. 
If you meant people laugh at &lt;100% service guarantees for "things like this" I still have to disagree.

Less facile response: Yes, as long as user-facing tools make the fee calculation easy and transparent and users are given clear, reasonable default choices for delay versus price. 
It's informative to consider uber's surge pricing by analogy. Surge pricing's primary purpose isn't to boost supply, but to spread demand peaks out over time.
Of course, uber supply _does_ increase with consistent surge pricing, because drivers learn to expect higher income at certain times and are more likely to work then, and because more of the population will elect to drive if expected earnings are higher. 
uber's strength lies in combining short term demand control with reducing the friction and time constants for supply response -- for example, offering easy-approval leasing programs with no fixed term, taking care of permitting paperwork for drivers, etc. The second half of this equation is what bitcoin is learning right now.

Right - adopt a mentality of service levels: express, priority, standard, bulk (corresponding to expected confirmation waits of 1, 2, 5, n blocks at the 95% confidence level based on historical trends) and pay according to your needs. This is quite similar to the mail/freight industry's pricing model.

Sure, but why let Craig Wright do the installation? Now you've got a prop brought in by an assistant, which CW handles after unsealing but before verification.
Edit: And wait a minute - Gavin seems to be talking about the _signing_ laptop here. This doesn't make any sense at all - you don't need to care if the signing laptop is clean or not, only the verifying one. Or am I just totally misunderstanding his quote?
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:11:16
Look at this from Gavin's comment that VB was following up on, emphasis mine:


In his comments to Wired, Gavin says CW's administrative assistant bought the laptop, and in his comments here he says CW installed software on that laptop. No proof of malfeasance there but it does little to inspire confidence...

This isn't hidden somewhere on an obscure part of their website, either; it's in a prime spot on their Points program landing page:
And - bitcoin is listed under the "Easy" column and directly compared with CC and PayPal, which look like bad deals in comparison!
Way to go Gyft on actually putting some marketing effort into promoting bitcoin usage at your site. 
I'll just leave this here: Vendor discounts are one example of the feedback mechanisms that make it possible for a nascent, highly deflationary currency to outcompete an established inflationary currency in gaining transaction market share. This is only possible during the adoption phase, however, when deflation is accelerated by much, much higher economic growth than in the total economy. During this phase the wealth effect for holders of the nascent currency can lead to short-term consumption despite an anticipation of greater future value. ("btc up 100%?
