There are a lot of people who now got burned by btc, meaning they are no longer willing buyers. We are now on the other side of this mountain, watch out below.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:31:48
Well it kinda is..
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:17:42
There were far more frequent recessions and bank runs and they lasted longer when we were on the gold standard and there was no FED. FDR, the greatest president in US History, understood that, and that's why we got off the gold standard. You are brainwashed, not the people who actually understand history.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:40:17
Plenty more who want to jump in? Really, where is your evidence of this? I see evidence against it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:03:44

Blockchain is not a technological revolution, tbh
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:34:15
This generation will make huge changes, but not through crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:24:40
So you actually made a little money investing in a bubble bc you were too stupid to know any better, then, rather than investing intelligently, you blow it on an overpriced gaming PC. You can't make this shit up. Its the reason most people are poor. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:33:58
Minimum wage was higher on a relative basis in the 1960's, so was median income. You aren't comparing apples to apples. Don't blame the effects of income inequality on fiat currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:37:19
Just because the FED is a central bank, doesn't mean they are "centrally" managing our economy.  I posted the link and the history is clear. FED and no gold standard = fewer and shorter recessions. Its history.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:20:08
no moron its worth 100
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:38:39
Again you are blaming fiat currency for the effects of income inequality. Not the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:05:33
bc you can no longer think rationally. youre emotionally invested. btw, that chart is flat out misleading. Think about how many hours must have been worked in 1947 to buy a tv vs today. Use common sense people.

What does this even mean? "no one controls it". You do understand that almost all currencies are allowed to float and aren't pegged to a standard.

BC Bitcoin is a scam being pushed by brokers et al
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:33:17

There are plenty of pharma stocks that have gone up 20 to 50 percent overnight. that is a greater roi per unit time than btc. bitboys are morons

Can you arrogant douches stop pretending you are saving the world with bitcoin. There are a million other more worthy causes.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:49:46
You people are nuts. Bitcoin in the grand scheme of inventions ranks very very low on the impact scale. Bitcoin isn't the internet, its not amazon, its not even drones, its just a new all digital way to move and store value. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:08:31
I'm going to caution you against coming up with over the top conspiracies to explain something as simple as an asset bubble. The China bans were simply triggers, they are exposing fairer BTC VALUE in the market auction, not causing it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:58:39
I think bit hodlers should stop handing out financial advice.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:11:43
What is the motivation at this point for more people to buy? If you are a end of timer, you already own bit coin. If you are looking to get rich quick, you probably don't have much money to begin with and can't afford to lose more. 
 
For a digital product that doesn't trade on any real fundamentals, doesn't earn anything, doesn't provide a meaningful service, good luck finding new investors/speculators.

Doesn't matter about market depth, how much of that is spoofed? How much slippage are you going to give up getting in and out? It's not the sp500 futures market, its bitcoin. Even a single million dollar order will move the market considerably.
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:24:44
Sounds like you need a new brokerage.   I can  move money in and out of my accounts in seconds. 
Plus you are giving up the ability to invest in the most liquid, fair, regulated market in the world to trade digital tokens...? thats just dumb
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:30:05
Sad when even Chinese government understands how these fake currencies are a scam, but not the US Govt.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:12:10
Not to rain on your parade, but the bitcoin bubble is childs play compared to almost every other bubble in human history.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:20:58
No one is trying to ban Bitcoin in America because its not a threat to anything despite the illusions of grandeur from bitbros.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:51:34
probably it ill just stay 2-5k for decades and become a minor currency
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:52:12
Now fiat currency caused the Great Recession.. OK
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:54:13
If you're smart you will learn from this. There is no easy money. People spend years learning how to trade, how to invest, they have seen bubbles, amazing run ups, and crashes. Imagine for a second how familiar this all looks to someone trying to warn young investors who thought they were going to get rich buying btc. 
The sooner you realize how hard it is to make $, the better off you will be.
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:59:43
Make millions?? No way. There isn't enough liquidity, they would drive the market up too fast to get in at the bottom with that quantity. Just like the drove price down in the first place.
Bitcoin is in a downtrend, you didn't think your imaginary coins were going to just keep going up forever did you? Welcome to the real world, looks like youre going to have to get a job now bitboys
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:53:51
China was the lion share of new demand. Where is this new demand going to come from? Further dilution from mining will lower prices.

Tell us what extraordinary change have you made from the basement of your mom's house? I voted for Obama, 21 million people have healthcare right now.

Hey dummy,  300 million is NOTHING, the Emini futures markets trade hundreds of billions daily.The post says millions (plural). So lets say we are only using 5 million that is 5/300 roughly ,1.5% which a large percent in only 1 trade. We weren't talking about spacing your trades out over weeks. Get educated. pay attention.You are an amateur idiot, and you could learn a lot from the pros.
