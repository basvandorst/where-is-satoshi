Hahaha! Theft from who? The government produces nothing! Everything the government makes comes from OUR labor not the other way around!

I guess since it's debt and it's their "money", I suppose they can restrict what you purchase with it. Different if it was a bank and it was your own money, I guess. Although banks aren't much better which is why I've been working my way out of their system as well...

The security vs quantitative easing gives it intrinsic value...

Not sure why anyone believes the overly sensationalist drama queen media at all...

Taxation is theft!

Addresses are not tied to SSNs and they never will be. But more importantly, it's dumb to just roll over and give them money just because they say so just so they can bail out a bunch of rich bankers that screwed up. It's time to use leverage to make them convince us why we should still be paying them 30-50% of our money that they just go off and waste. WE are the cause of government bloat because we give them so much damn money. It's time to tighten their belt for them!

Man government really sucks for crypto... So glad that bitcoin has a permissionless aspect to it....  Meltem does make me melt when she talks tho...

I like DASH.  Only about 10% tho.

We're still in a place where it's doable.  Especially if the up and downs continue.  I treat it like it's a savings account.  Whenever I get extra money, I throw it in.  Even $5 (through Cash app).  I don't put any money into stocks or mutuals anymore.  Just Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:33:53
Make sure you keep your promise to yourself. I've got a buddy still butthurt from the 20k crash who didn't stack during the downturn. Now all he does is rock in his seat and bash crypto all day...
@_date: 2019-07-18 12:46:28
It's game over for buyers every other month.  Hope that helps....

In my opinion, he was looking to get rich quick and when that didn't happen he got mad about it.  I told him the whole time you have to have a steel gut to watch the crypto market and it will pay off if you take all emotion out of it.  I guess he didn't believe it.
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:01:08
A lot of people get stuck on owning a whole bitcoin but as the value increases it won't matter.  Even 0.1 bitcoin will be very valuable.  Also, ideally in the future, bitcoin will be valued in bitcoin/satoshis so those will be the only numbers that matter.  At a high valuation, 3 satoshis will be buying you a jug of milk.  Don't get hung up on owning a whole coin, just keep stacking sats!

While something shoddy is going on with that situation, I was able to get back in after a reset and a reinstall of the firmware. Yes it's dogshit UX but you are able to get in after those steps.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:02:01
Ah I see but then I don't think that matches up with the 50k bitcoin millionaires.  I'm not sure if any one individual action owns a million bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-15 00:58:50
Now we know what he owns...
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:35:43
If they convert to cash, the bitcoin gets put back into the pool.  Also, bitcoins are fractional.  If bitcoin goes up to $5 million for instance, that could be 105 millions splitting a bitcoin into 5 and so on and so forth.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:07:34
Yeah that's too much rigamarole for my liking.  I hate to say it but I'm sticking with coinbase.  That's not the only reason but I just closed my account today.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:51:49
Haha!  Right?
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:50:57
I think the point of bitcoin is to be able to use it outside of those tedious systems and have free exchange without the blessing of some large centralized authorities.  The fact that Fortune 500 won't support it is irrelevant.  The real challenge is getting THE PEOPLE to use it as a medium of exchange amongst each other.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:42:50
I always considered technical analysis on any coins a misapplication.  The trends are meaningless if bitcoin is truly a currency.  The best you're going to get is price history in a graph.
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:23:47
By the way KYC is nonsense.  The government KNOWS who the money launderers are and they aren't dealing with $3,000 one time transactions!  Most are working WITH the government themselves!
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:22:11
It's a scam 100% because they don't tell you this BEFORE you deposit.  I've steered away from ShitBTC for a long time now...
@_date: 2019-10-16 00:59:24
I'm glad he was able to articulate his points so clearly!
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:38:36
Taxation is theft... And stupid...
@_date: 2019-10-14 15:12:49
I'm just amazed that this ardent statist is doing anything remotely crypto!
@_date: 2019-10-11 21:37:59
Nah.... they just uglified the UI...
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:41:50
Probably so but I'll dollar average when it goes down. I'm holding bags but I evened out by gradually accumulating fractions at sub $4,000... I could be wrong but I don't see it making it all the way down that far this time...
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:01:09
Turning it black market will make it MORE valuable than less!
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:48:55
What a loser!
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:32:45
Man that sucks.  I wish there were some bigger DEXs out there.  Bitcoin is gettable but it would be better to have a source with more liquidity...
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:00:00
Why? Because he missed the boat?
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:25:37
ShitBTC is the worst!
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:49:06
Not at all!

Private keys in a safe or safety deposit box?

Most "dumps" are short lived...

Yeah that article is nonsense.  There is no way Hong Kong protestors NOT wanting to be rounded up are using this app!

The government because it lessens their ability to steal at will...

All it takes is one gateway on the mesh network really...
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:30:50
Tomato tomato... I'm actually for all forms of tax evasion anyway... even if it is euphemistically called "tax avoidance".  The taxation is the immoral part of the equation, not the "evasion".
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:48:27
Come on, guys!  Those bombs aren't going to pay for themselves!
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:59:12
Isn't that grand? One of the largest tax evaders is helping the government catch "tax evaders". Go figure....
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:04:18
So funny how many bitcoiners love taxes. Why not stick with fiat?
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:02:52
They need our money to bomb brown children caught in conflicts that have nothing to do with us!
