Clearly I'm kidding. But I'm speaking of regulation on the FinCEN, AML/KYC levels. I do believe anti-money laundering rules should be implemented. I just don't think that running it through a centralized entity is the solution or modifying the code for this reason. 
But to answer one of your questions(SFW): 
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:28:56
Not at all. Coordination is not a word used to exclusively describe any of what you've mentioned. I don't think you've paid attention to the english language.
You've have directly insinuated: Tyrannies, monarchies and the worst forms of government are coordinated. Even if they were coordinated that has no bearing on the fact that the US government should be coordinated. Coordination and dictatorship and otherwise are not synonyms. 'Basically', you are saying they are.

They = a bunch of people. The person publicly responsible for the accident = 1. To say that EVERYONE in the USMS is mentally capable and only ONE person is not would be foolish. Are there lots of bright people in the government as a whole? Certainly. Per capita, how many bright people are in a crypto business vs say your post office or hell, even the USMS? I know where I place my bet.

In other words, idiots were put in charge of facilitating this process on some level. My point is that more idiots will be regulating Bitcoin most likely. I'm not interested in that happening.
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:45:03
Disclosing / mis handling private information? Hmm. I can't think of any small errors in code or credit card or banking security anywhere.... Oh wait!

The reason Bitcoin was avoided was because Facebook had banned other Bitcoin apps before. So to give it the best chances of being approved Bitcoin was omitted. There is Bitcoin, Litecoin and other coin love there for sure. But getting past the approval hurdles were the most important first steps.
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:13:00
I agree with you. And this reinforces my point. I don't want an altcoin to cater to any regulation.
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:32:30
Please read the title, which says, "Could". That does not say did. Its obviously a worry that I have that whoever does eventually regulate the industry, if and when that happens, will not do it properly. Are you saying it will be regulated properly if and when that does happen? You are not worried in the slightest that regulation will hamper at the minimum some aspect of crypto currency? If not, then you are a troll. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2014-06-20 05:48:00
With all due respect, are you trying to insinuate that the USMS has only one paper pusher? If we went and took a tally of people who are at the USMS, would you honestly wager that a majority of them are qualified for crypto related work? If I told you that i'm not deducing this conclusion from this single data point, would I still be overgeneralizing? If my wife cheated on me but I couldn't prove it, is it still cheating? You are pushing an angle which can be rebut many ways. Sometimes its just best to let it happen my friend. This is not my first rodeo with various levels of government. FTC, FCC even. You'd think the FCC is full of smart people. Believe me, thats not quite the case in its entirety by a long shot.

People are using credit cards because its adoption is already 'widespread'. Spending dollars is already widespread. While I agree that tools could be implemented to make the fractions 'invisible' and simpler to use, getting it 'widespread' first before those tools will ever get the chance to make someone's life easier may be difficult. I hate the decimals myself, personally.
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:49:20
Government is not efficient, mismanaged on many levels and they don't know their arm from their leg in far too many cases which is another reason to be self regulated. I appreciate your opinion, and my post will be edited to highlights the USMS as that is who I'm directly referring. I've sent thousands and thousands of emails and never once have I ever forgotten to place an email in BCC instead of CC when necessary. 
With cryptos, there is little or no room for mistake. The first chance they touch crypto on this scale publicly and they mess it up. The end.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:49:15
The 'state' regulates all of those industries. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:38:44
Very good point, although I wish lost funds or assets upon no one.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:33:28
Perhaps by stopping your Food Stamps. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:42:43
The government SHOULD be a coordinated 'thing'. Pretty silly that you think it shouldn't be.
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:26:59
They are there to put the safety measures in place. No matter how many rules you have, there are going to be mistakes. A few frauds in the crypto world and people are clamoring for regulation. There are SOO many frauds in the traditional banking space today even with regulation. Yes I'm aware that the scales here are different but my point is, you can never prevent frauds in their entirety. I am not against regulation, I am against improper regulation which is what I'm worried about. I am fine with no regulation as well. Too many people are worked up over their bitcoin being worth 40k a pop and need regulation to make that happen. This is the wrong reason to want regulation.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:53:46
I don't hate the government. I pay more taxes than your average Joe. I'm not exactly happy about that, but I am willing. I do not however like the idea of the 'government' or whatever body it will be regulating how I can spend, trade and use my Bitcoin etc. If my son has a matchbox car and he wants to trade it for a set of fucking pogs, I want to be able to do that without asking anyones permission. The end.
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:59:30
Any fuck ups by any government sector for any reason is simply more shit on my plate. I've seen enough to have zero tolerance and this point.
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:34:07
Well this is exactly what I'm worried about. Perhaps they will require a change to the codebase which makes it more identifiable/traceable and some altcoin will adhere to these rules and Bitcoin will have to become black/grey market. This is just a terrible side effect of regulation, although extreme, its the basis of my post. I'm simply concerned of the rules/regulation that will be enforced, if and when they do become enforced. I don't see why people disagree with me and are standing up for the government. They just want to see regulation for the sake of their bitcoin becoming worth more. Sad.

The point would be, who put this person who knows nil in that job? Does that sound like a smart move, to delegate responsibilities to those with no understanding of what they are doing or dealing with? Was it this secretaries job to appoint herself to this duty, as in she assigned herself to this task? She made the decision to make herself available to respond to potential bidders? Thats just not true. Even if it was, someone put her in that position of power. Who is that someone? Thats right, in your analogy that would be Burger King, not Apple. Cya.

I don't believe the document, but as someone who would hold a percentage of money offline, you must put it back if someone withdraws from their account. With a cold wallet, you inherently aren't keeping every user's funds readily available to spend. So when people look at their balance, they see the funds in their hot wallet as well as, invisibly to them, funds that are not available to them in the cold wallet. If they withdraw more from their hot wallet balance than is there, Gox would HAVE to make a deposit into an address under the users account in the hot wallet, (Addresses are assigned to accounts inside of bitcoind with the 'setaccount' command-Source:  so that the withdrawal could occur. Gox can't reject this withdrawal unless they can prove there is fraud, hence the malleability claim. How is the cold wallet empty? It slowly eroded away at them. Thats what this article, fake or not is trying to insinuate. Now, why would anyone wait 7 years, well maybe it took them a while to notice the fraud due to massive profits, profits that have been issued to stakeholders of the company and now we have a huge disparity between liability and assets. Perhaps they couldn't cease trading due to this security hole otherwise risk their companies position and reputation by admitting a security flaw. Or perhaps the claim that the wallet is empty is false.

They use the word puppet for good reason. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:28:16
Same here, I find it funny although I have dogecoin. Admittedly I've sold some doge in the millions for drk a few weeks ago just in time to see it sky rocket, but I still have over a million in a wallet I won't sell until its worth nothing or worth a lot.

Bitcoin is probably working already right now. But for the approval process it was omitted. Keep in mind this tipping platform has been around for months. Quick coin is a rehash of an old bitcoin app for facebook which sends payments directly to other people, ala payment service. It got banned. Spinning up a new coin on the FB tip platform is pretty much as simple as syncing the block chain.
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:06:44
Hmm. So what utility does the US or Canadian Dollar have over the Euro or the Dinar or vice versa?
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:59:03
An additional point, is if 1 satoshi becomes worth too much, it will be literally impossible to use bitcoin for smaller transactions. Unless a huge change is made in the way bitcoin operates, and you'd be dealing and spending in .0000000000000001 bitcoins to the 16th decimal. That alone in my opinion provides utility to other coins. I think you're a bit biased, but thats fine :)

Exchanges should not be savings accounts. So you are precisely right. Exchange, and move your money off. A bad example but an example nonetheless, go to the airport. Change your funds for pesos at the booth. Then ask them to hold your money while you check out the shops.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:46:56
No, it would not. Everyone would flip out and start picketing them. Here, we have everyone defending the government because they think that regulation will make them rich. Silly sheep. You ARE NO BETTER THAN THE POLITICIANS.
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:56:50
Precisely. Nobody can tell me that ineptness is contained within the USMS. Go to the post office, those old ladies, thats who I picture they have put in charge of responding to these emails. This is obiously an extreme example, but they are not skilled workers in the crypto space. People dealing with anything crypto absolutely should be.
@_date: 2014-06-20 05:03:05
Please do. If I stoop to the stupidity level required to disclose the names of potential investors of anything which obviously should be private, you should blame the person that hired me. However I've been a small business owner for over a decade so you'd just be blaming me.
Doing anything right or regulating a crypto currency? You are talking about something entirely different, so herp derp in your own thread. Its clear the government, at least the USMS is full of paper pushers. You sound like one, lol.
@_date: 2014-02-01 19:02:57
1 dollar is a big stretch. But in 50-100 years when everyone here is dead and the value of the dollar has inflated, why not? The 'top' coin may yet to be created. Look at Blackberry. Smartphone King, errr..
