implying you can choose which countrie's citizen you can be. LOL.

neutral to other state but not its citizens.

yes, both, santa and society are just ideas, not a real thing, unlike individual.
@_date: 2014-12-31 15:08:01
the irony is that THEY CAN. They CAN take your stuff, either you like it or not. And state and all the rich fucks do it on regular bases. The funny thing is that you do not see it.

no need to agree with everyone to be left alone. I don't agree with you but yet I don't want to pass a law to force you act as I wish. I let you live as you want, and only require same from you.
Democracy is about forcing the minority of society to act how majority wants, thus 51 percent tyranny. You get it now?


why would I want to go into such a hassle over some piece of paper? Why can't I just be left alone from your "constitution"? 


this is simply not true. If I disagree with your majoritarian consitution I will go to jail for acting according to my principles. 


yet there is none. Show me where it says that every person is free to associate with whoever he wants and act according to his principles. Show me :)


every country where your worshiped "democracy" is. You said yourself, "I can vote". I am 49 percent, I vote against, yet I am forced to be a slave to 51 because they had more votes. This is democracy. You seem to still not get it. 2 plus 2 equal 4, not 5.

jews should have left too... I mean, it is their fault for being gased in chambers!

Why would someone want to be shot? People are sent to jail, it is enough. I would rather choose a jail myself than get shot.

I think reality is the best source to your imaginary alternative. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:43:29
your analogy doesn't work. Cells make a monolith structure called human being who can act. Society doesn't act, only individuals do. And it is not a monolith. Guess some people just can't understand simple things.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:13:14


then what happens if 49 percent want to pass a different law nullifying the previous one? Can they do it? Can a one person do it? If this isn't slavery then WHAT happens if I simply don't want to submit to the 51 percent rulership?
You are done because you saw that democracy is basically a tyranny of majority (aka 51 percent) and that scared you. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 21:28:31
:) it's all subjective duuuuuude
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:13:16
democratic state doesn't equal that whatever decides your "majority" is moral or/and legitimate.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:06:27
hahaha wow when people go full retard it is fun just read their ramblings and justifications for their enslavement
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:11:57
it has nothing to do with that. Human is seperate being unlike society. Society doesn't have a brain. I don't know how else I can explain that to you. You either get it or don't.
@_date: 2014-11-16 08:02:16


me not being able to chose other things than a majority is the definition of infringing on individual rights. Democracy has nothing to do with "individual rights".
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:45:34
oh shit, using sarcasm to avoid making a rational argument, I can't respond to that. You got me.
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:44:48
if you can not see a difference between a concept (forest) and an entity (tree) then you surely do not know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:18:45


yes, you just proved yourself to be a tyrant, one of the 51 percent. Seeing a trend now?


so if two wolves and a sheep vote what's for dinner, sheep can not complain right?


I can't tell if you are a moron when I several times just SHOWED you how majority decides what's best for minority without its consent and yet it is somehow not a tyranny for you. Maybe you live in an opposite world, where war is peace and ignorance is strength? You yourself said that you wouldn't allow me anything that your worshiped constitution says.
Constitution is useless piece of paper.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:05:19
instead of making short answer you give me history lesson of what the "law" is.

QFT 
Given a choice between choosing how their own money is spent, and choosing a politician to spend their money for them, rational people will always choose the former.
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:37:40


you make no sense. I am not denying herd mentality or something like that. It is not about psychology of a group, but what actually IS society and what it IS NOT.
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:45:32
fuck I am arguing with nihilist. It is like arguing with moral subjectivists. Useless. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 05:25:27
the people have chosen? Which people? So you think majority can decide what's best for minority? Oh, well, I guess then germans chose to gas the juice and US should have never intervened into the war because it was german choice to make. Might makes right guise.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:35:06
So all your arguments where rebutted and the only thing you can say is that you didn't like them and you see it pointless? Well, happy living in your delusion that whatever 51 percent decides isn't tyranny after I even gave you a simple even dumb kid could understand example about two wolves and a sheep. It is like you don't want to understand my position. 
However, I am happy you haven't used usual trump card in such debates known as "love it or leave it". 
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:38:07


prevents what? The tyranny? Are you kidding? Constitution is a document by 51 percent, aka tyranny of majority. So it is still 49 percent of people are slaves to the 51 percent's constitution. What if I don't agree with "constitution"? Am I allowed not to endorse it? It is you who doesn't have a clue, because you repeat the same nonsense everytime and can't understand the simple concept of being free to associate with whoever you see fit. Now society is literally forced to be slaves to the 51 percent of people who chose what they like and won't let 49 percent to live as they wish.
@_date: 2014-06-07 11:47:30
so wait, there are something more, not just individuals? Like secret organizm like society? Or a group? Where can I talk to it? I am sure it is a monolith super being and not just a bunch of people.
@_date: 2014-06-08 10:41:08
and individual is acting monolith being. Society isn't an organism, it doesn't have shared consciousness, it isn't sci-fiction, so stop trolling with your cell analogy because you know I am right.

groups do not make decisions, just people. Stop believing in santa.
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:16:03
Society is just a label for a group of individuals, like forest is a group of trees, but you can not see forest as an entity, only trees. Same with society.
@_date: 2014-07-09 11:10:17


problem is that if 49 percent disagrees with 51 percent, the law still gets passed on and 49 percent become literally the slaves to 51 percent. That's how all modern democracies work.

Google KNOWS people use their search engine to download torrents, PC and other "illegal" stuff, so is google liable according to your logic, for violating copyright and other nonsense imaginary laws? Where is the proof that he made Silk Road for drugs anyway?

Hi, I am brigade from r/ancap
No, you are naive, because you imagine all people are stupid but if you give certain people all the power to control other people then they become somehow not stupid and trustworthy. This is naivety. What ancaps propose is personal responsibility. For your actions.
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:36:32


projecting much? Replies are rational arguments to your nonsensical assertions and logical fallacies, like my quote above.
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:38:25
The government can not incriminate itself for the government is both, the judge and the juror. It is literally above the law. It makes the law.
