Good idea, it may motivate more developers to answer questions.

It's different from a technical view. While in practice, you would be required to have 'extra data' to spend a transactions in both solutions.

Trezor offers API support and is open source, these are the major differences I think. 
Here is a comparison chart:

Fee on 10 BTC is only 0.02 BTC on btc-e. Paymium has a fee of 0.59%.  Depending on the opportunity, it could pay off but you would need enough volume.

afaik yes, still a large number of randomness.

The sites owner controls your bitcoins. If you want to store large amounts consider hardware wallets or cold storage.

The program uses Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme:
I agree, it is a simple operation but cool :-) I think the author of the software (vbuterin) chose the Shamir scheme because by splitting the key an attacker would know parts of the original private key with each private key found. With this scheme an attacker would theoretically not know anything about the original private key if he/she has a few derrived keys. You are correct, the weakest point is the reassemly.

If you are connected to the internet then chances are it is send somewhere. The type of virus you mention is a keylogger, they come in both software and hardware forms. At best get a live disc and generate while being offline.

To receive BTC all you need to have is a bitcoin address. Maybe this is what you are looking for :   (use at your own risk, I didn't program this)
An alternative you may like is to put advertisements on your site and use streaming "for free". This is long term, while the other is short term.

I did not upvote or downvote this post. 
Isn't using two URLs not somewhat similar to 2FA ?  
Related: Currently there is a proposal to let users control the private keys, and thus private keys would never be on a webserver. You can read more about that here   or here

similar but less detailed :-P

Bitcoin ATM or a trusted exchange.

Inside coinbase you can make a transaction to another bitcoin address, which could be a hardware wallet or paper wallet.

the brainwallet? the password is never transmitted over the line. you can alternatively set your private key in the code. only the transaction is transmitted.
