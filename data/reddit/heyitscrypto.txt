Sounds like you invested more than you can afford to lose.

Do you have a source for your claim of "50% of current transactions are illegal in nature"? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:31:23
Millions of people buying fractions of BTC is an increase in demand. So, yes they can.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:41:36
I call bullshit. Let's see the receipts.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:41:38
I'm in the US, so I'm not sure. Kraken might be a good choice. Bitfinex maybe.

Let's not forget they signed the New York backroom agreement and supported the segwit2x fork.

You need to sign up to an exchange such as Bittrex or Gemini to get into the alt game. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:48:38
Uuummm... Where did the Bitcoin go?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:28:42
What a fucking douchebag. Internet FTW!

And the terms of services that says we're ok with them doing whatever they see fit.

And they also don't care if you call it BTC, ltc or eth they want a cut of all your gains. Crypto to crypto they want their cut of the action. 
And they do care where your money is. Especially if it's technically in another country.

So then you paid a total of $25 in fees to move your funds between third parties that charged processing fees.
It's misleading of you to say "I just paid a $25 (transfer) fee".

I'm no tax expert by any means but I read up. Sounds to me like it hasn't been clarified by the IRS yet. 
And it looks like section 1031 now only applies to real estate after this new tax law.
Thanks buddy.

Zoom out

So how much BTC has moved since the fork? I imagine a large chunk of BTC is not active. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:45:25
Blockchain.info (the .com site is scam site) is not a hardware wallet but a web based wallet. Coinbase would be a better option than blockchain. Research the Ledger nano and the Trezor hardware wallets. Both are good long term storage options for Bitcoin.

The tilt of the B logo on the dudes sweater makes it look like BCH as well.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:50:37
You can't brute force guess the pin. After three wrong guesses the Ledger resets itself. You would then need your 24 word seed which they give you when you initially set up the device. These 24 words are what need to be securely backed up. You can add your own 25th word to secure the seed words they generate.
Hardware  designed to securely store your cryptocurrency is the best option.

So if you just alter the data you can see a trend? Kewl!
Come on man that's over 50% of the data set you want to exclude.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:03:10
Look at how they handle Bitcoin cash fork. Any one have their coinbase BCH yet? I would say they define short term as within the fiscal quarter.

HODL is the second mantra. Don't invest more than you can lose is the first. 
Good luck to you and your family.

Yeah take this week, price is up over ten percent. The fee with a linked bank account is only 1.5% and locks it in at the current (albeit slightly inflated) price. Worth it to me.

It's called snitching/ratting in your first scenario vs swatting in the latter.
