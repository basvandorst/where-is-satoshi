they also require a formal request to use the API now ... i hate the idea that for using public software you would need to go through an approval process. defeats the whole purpose.. but i will again take a look

essentially the only important thing is that when you create content and get paid for it that you can cash out within a few days. and this is happening. so all the other arguments to make a site really big are not that important. I have been active on steemit now for almost 24 hours straight and the content i come across is highly relevant and better than reddit. plus there is no downvoting. which i think is really good because a lot of people just downvote because they are frustrated in life.
