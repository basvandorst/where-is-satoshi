I tried the gbp exchange out but the volume for the past 24hrs was about 1.5btc compared to 3000btc in the usd pair. Just lots of people raising and cancelling orders from what I could make out and actual transactions few and far between. I should point out I am very very new to the world of trading and so I don't know if this really matters but I was hoping to practice somewhere a little busier...

Yes, my initial impression was poor, but that was the fault of the borrowers. I left it a while and dipped a toe back in and, so far so good. BTC JAM itself recommend diversification of 1btc per 100 investments and I'd be inclined to say that was savvy advice. I would also be sure to read the propositions rather than auto invest.

Remittences market is quite often quoted as being one of the areas for bitcoin and I am trying to get my head around;
-overseas worker earns local currency
-Assuming it is unbanked, that worker can go to W.U. with cash and the recipient can collect cash at correlating office.
Opposed to:
-worker recieves cash
-exchanges to bitcoins using ATM or local bitcoins (cost associated)
-similar exchange required by recipient ( unless bitcoins are widely accepted in that area!

I imagine that this is an already very competitive  market and that companies already facilitating remittance services are on the lowest margins. For bitcoin to edge in, would everyone wishing to utilise the cheaper alternative (bitcoin) be required to buy, send and hold bitcoins or is there a way that these existing companies use bitcoin to their advantage?

I agree to a certain extent. The whole "print a paper wallet for friends and family" notion struck me a desperation, but this would add legitimacy to those people who hear about Bitcoin but believe to be some underground nefarious cult like movement akin to anonymous and alike...when people see more  household brands accepting and embracing Bitcoin as a new technology it may ease their level of comfort and start considering it with validity.

But it does have to be on Apple platform? I wasn't referring to Apple being opposed to a Bitcoin app per se but more your involvement with bitcoin, but yeah, the reality is that I wanted an app made, you made it and there was nothing relating to Bitcoin other than that our contract was paid using bitcoins then there is no real reason for Apple to either know or care. My main point was that the crowd are becoming somewhat hostile toward Apple recently in retaliation.
Anyway, I probably shouldn't waste anymore of your time, unfortunately I don't have some wonder app idea...

Thanks for that! I am currently studying accountancy and the idea has crossed my mind that by the time I have completed studying that automated, digitally transferred, triple entry accounting will eradicate alot of the need for the data inputting aspects of this industry. However, on a personal level (i.e.selfish) I am interested in pursuing the management/ cost accounting route and as this is more concerned with interpretting outcomes and using that information to advise how best to proceed, this still has a very human element that is safe (for now) from the developments in Bitcoin....

I think trolls are merely mischievous, where as your comments are thoughtful, passionate and rational a troll will counter your comments with automatic gain say for the explicit intention of getting a rise. It's baiting and bating!......
They are impervious to your attempts at shaming or ridicule because they are in no way emotionally attached to the content for which they attack you and your level of your displeasure is the scoring system. Reddit, despite being fantastic gives ground to this "sport" with no fear of recourse...The only defence is to muster self control and spoil their attempts by simply disregarding their comments completely....

Agreed. Having read posts in comment sections relating to bitcoin articles in various media outlets, it is remarkable how willing people are when it comes to being told how to feel about bitcoin.....ponzi, tulips, pyramid etc. but it is not suprising given the bombardment of pushed sentiment.

I'll say it.....cos some tit will only say it otherwise.......more people selling than buying.......ho ho ho. (such wit). Clearly you are asking what has influenced more selling than buying?.....and what with endorsements from the giant Microsoft you would have thought that mission moon was a goer but as I'm sure some other bright spark will point out (they usually do) Microsoft accepting bitcoins via bitpay means more bitcoins being liquidated ergo more selling and so short term outlook is downward pressure.

All money is digital nowadays, no one questions it because it has followed and evolutionary path. It started with bartering physical goods, then became gold coins, then gold backed currency and then (trust backed?) Currency.....now money resides in systems that belong to banks and gets transferred from one screen to another. Banks collectively hold huge sums of 'our' money and as a result are all powerful and rich as a result of gambling with 'our' money. Banks have just become irrelevant and unecessary. It may take time to filter down into everyone's consciousness, but it will because it is the logical next step!

Gold remains a popular choice as a store of value making it a tradeable commodity or asset and as I understand a couple of u.s. states affirm gold and silver as legal tender..... 
I'm no expert but this is what (i think) i have learned and am happy to stand corrected.....(however that is not an invitation for fellow redditors to shout 'twat' at me)

Bitcoin by definition makes the services that banks currently provide obsolete and as much as they innovate transfer and holding services, the control of fiat ultimately lays in their hands, centralising a form of value. Bitcoin is decentralised and therefore a different beast altogether. Banks recreating a Bitcoin like product would be akin to e-gold which failed for that very reason. Surely banks would be better concentrating their efforts in obtaining a healthy proportion of bitcoins and lending if they want a piece of the action, with smart contracts they could operate very cost efficiently. 
I'll admit that I may be out of my depth here, I may have missed important factors and am open to corrections....if I was that clever, I'd be very wealthy.......and I'm not......perhaps either of those two things.....
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:39:44
Who knows?......For quick ROI, it's risky. My opinion (and I imagine there is a lot of support in the sub) is that long term there is great promise (or is it hope?).  If you think you'd like in, probably a good time to buy a small amount t and familiarise with how to obtain bitcoins, where to store etc.... because if this goes off how I imagine it will, it will happen within a short space of time (post SR price went from $35 to $1200 within??? a week with the steepest incline occurring within 48hrs).
Treat it like gambling, only bet what you can afford to lose....treat it as a loss until you cash out......(or don't cash out, because you don't need to and it is ubiquitous as any other form of currency)

I think bitcoins will work alongside fiat for quite some time but a market will establish itself as price increases.

1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,1024,2048......I used to work in a casino. They have table limits for a reason. Learning how to play blackjack and applying the same method gives you a better edge. If you have $2048 to gamble after having lost £2047 (11 losing hands) to win $1 for 12 hands play then you are probably not the sort of player that plays to win $1! Raise the stake, raise the risk....potentially hit table max before returning stake.....There is a reason that casinos have been making vast sums of cash for hundreds of years.

Banks in the U.K. are a lot slower these days to extend credit to even conventional businesses, both start ups and existing customers. Wannabe mortgage applicants are having to jump through hoops. Banks themselves are being throttled and losing the competitive edge as a result of regulations imposed to counter their own bad practises. 
The news that a new business in a new industry with no way of providing any assurance for forecasts is being rejected by these behemoths bloated and constricted by their own greed, is no surprise at all.
I am glad that you are now able to move forward and run with the baton.....Good Luck!

@_date: 2014-12-11 13:21:53
If you acquired bitcoins because there is now a use for you, then buy bitcoins, spend bitcoins....repeat. ... Yes as always this will inevitably put downward pressure on the short term price but long term it adds legitimacy and make Bitcoin a viable currency. Which fulfils one of its many potentials.....
If, like many here, you believe that as more and more companies begin to accept and more and more consumers use Bitcoin then it will become useful and attain a purpose ergo it's inherent value as in people 'believe' in it, which in turn means that it is in higher demand ergo price rise, then by all means buy and 'hold' some too.....

Expedia accepting bitcoin and transferring funds into dollar means more sell orders. Assuming people buy to replace, the price will go up again. More companies doing this cycle will result in overall higher price than at present and the volatility decreases as the the upswings counteract the down with a gradual push up until the whatever number of companies will eventually operate acceptance of bitcoin.

Thanks Albert, I really appreciate the time you have taken to lighten the mood. Bitcoin needs this test to see if it is up to the challenge, it was never going to be a free ride. It is still in development and only time will tell how good it really is, whether it will be allowed to fulfil its potential and whether it is strong enough to remain 'good' rather than distorted or squashed....
Thats what I reckon anyway.....but that could just be a load of old bollocks....

What's going to be obsolete? Miners? Mining? Presumably miners are going to be relevant until at least 2140. In which time the anticipation is that bitcoins become more valuable and so the rewards for mining/hashing increase?After all the bitcoins are mined then all the transactions taking place on the network have to be hashed and the miners fee will be the reward.... these are genuine questions, I am not trying to be cocky and wonder if I am misunderstanding something.

I know. It seems like they are playing a game as to 'how far can they take the piss', I guess with balance sheets akin to that of the gdp of small countries they can do whatever the fuck they feel like and whilst we are at it 'fuck you mr e oss'.
In saying all this though, it has taken me nearly a year and a half of observing bitcoin, thinking about it and deconstructing, in my mind, how the abstract concept of money works appreciate why bitcoin represents an improved challenger...
I understand the concern of onlookers and newbies that you don't 'own' anything when you buy into bitcoin but find it funny that with the system they currently pertain to is promises, pretty pieces of paper and digits on a screen. Presumably it is just a mindset that has evolved from the days where one had physical assets (denoted by precious metal) deposited in vaults in exchange for tokens of assurance and that this method had continued from generation to generation being the accepted way, with propsed alternatives being deemed folly, ponzi and alike.

I speak as another non techie lurker, albeit for quite some time now and the conclusion that I come to is that this bitcoin movement is still very young and not yet sanitised for general usage amongst the wider public. Inthe same way as the internet was in the 90's a bewildering place that many did not see it's real uses that we see more so now with wide use of facebook/paypal/ebay on smartphones by non nerds who wouldn't really consider themselves to be using the internet. I see a few more layers being added and in some respects infrastructure making use of bitcoin protocol that advertising would be wasted as a activist movement shouting about something that the non initiated see as irrelevant or too confusing to bother with.

If nothing else, Bitcoin has made me consider the philosophy and question "what is money". Conservative chancellor tentatively allowing, i.e. not blocking, burgeoning Bitcoin industry is all that is required for Bitcoin to potentially gather pace, however I didn't sense a great deal of appetite for private money in this debate but more so , " how do we address regulation surrounding banking processes "....hints on reducing fractional reserve or enforcing new restrictions on how and who was to receive 'new money'/ loans and that a small amount of inflation is a good thing.....Hopefully this will grace a little time for all the additional benefits of Bitcoin and blockchain to prevail........we shall see

What is the real motivation for these people, who can transfer their money, pay for things online, send money to friends (venmo, paym etc).....etc, etc. to use Bitcoin?

Hi Thank you....that is very kind. I have 2x 2012 1btc casascius coins, but as I have mentioned in response to some of the other replies here I have felt reassured by other people's desire to obtain these coins. Shit, who knows, maybe death or glory but for what I paid for them I would feel sick as a pig to part with them only for them to be precious items in the future. This exposure to Bitcoin by way of having a stake in it has motivated a lot of learning into areas that would have otherwise remained hidden to me, from politics, the nature of money, trading, business and more and by keeping that stake maintains my active interest in learning more...

I think I understand. So it does not so much as 'generate' a new address as opposed to bagging a potential formation of alphanumeric combination that is connected to my wallet? But principally if someone who I have received funds from in the past assumes my previous address and as a surprise, sends funds......if I no longer have access to that address......it's gone!..?

Yes, another post that I saw that featured this quote is what inspired my line of questioning. The reason I ask is because despite lurking around bitcoin forums for nearly 3 years I think it is fairly safe to assume I am your typical layperson and still have difficulties grasping the technical nature of most issues featured in this sub. Throughout my course of experimenting I have tried hive, airbitz, mycelium, pheeva, etc. etc. and I don't think it is unfair to assume that one would not wish to keep all of these wallets active. I, thankfully am not aware of having lost funds as a result but it could quite easily happen and if, what most people hope will occur and more laypeople enter the bitcoin space that this issue be considered..

All true yes, but the fact is that the heads of states who have imposed these conditions upon Greece represent taxpayers in their own countries that have parted with money that they didn't want to part with, to support the dream of yesteryears leaders of a European project that could rival existing and emerging contemporary super powers. Greece has jeopardised its position and the whole project for far too long, Greece should never have been allowed to join and should not have been allowed to continue to be a part of the Eurozone. The only way forward from the shambolic state in which Europe finds itself in today was to either leave the eurozone (which neither Greece nor the rest of Europe desire as it will be a big blow for the ideal and the markets will react badly which could bring about a demise even sooner) or to offer assistance with some kind of collateral. Its clear that the Greeks have been pissing around and now it has to stop unless everyone is to get r right royally fucked up the arse!

I have used bitbargain numerous times and can report only good experiences. You can do a bank transfer or PAYM. Seeing that it is your first time might I suggest you experiment with a small order so as to gain experience. Be sure to transfer any funds out of the bitbargain wallet as they will charge interest on funds held there and I'll go further to recommend Mycellium wallet.

Ha, I love the idea of smuggling bacon and cheese, it's got to be done.......it's like midnight express. 
There is no limitation to where in the world maybe as long as it has an address and that address may be many miles from an expat shop. 
I appreciate that Tesco brand lemonade is not the most compelling test case that I could have presented but I meant more generally that expat shops tend to off Heinz beans, Marmite, cadburys etc whereas if you had one of those unexplainable tastes ("Don't ask me why I like it, I just do")......then I can pop in the shop and send it out. Equally if you are living in Australia and your partner has a brithday coming up, you may think......I know, I'll get them one of those cakes that they really like.....

If it reaches a bigger market and reaches its full saturation point, wherever that may be, only then will we see its potential stability.

prices need to fluctuate for speculators to make money, if you hold a large amount of bitcoin you can destabilise the price by selling, riding the wave as other panic sell and then gobble up some coins cheaper than that of the ones that you sold.......buy up enough and you may see a rally at which point.........you can sell a few. Stand back and see if anything happens organically, if not.......do it again......

Don't be sorry, you are demolishing my dreams here. It was an idea that I thought would be helpful as well as offering people who wished to spend bitcoin and opportunity to do so. It would serve my interest in as much as when I went to the supermarket I would buy a few extra items and be able to have a regular bitcoin saving fund whilst negating fees associated with bitcoin acquisition. Admittedly £2 jars of Branston pickle for £10 sounds extortionate, but not as much as the £30 equivalent. There are websites operating which presumably means there is demand and its not always expats that may use such a service, people who used live in the UK generally, people who have British friends etc are other potential customers that spring to mind.

Bit of a tenuous link to hidden costs of accepting cash as being the cost to physically manufacture bank notes. Not something that would be a direct cost to a retailers accounts. Although banking fees and travelling to and from banks with large amounts of cash does present situations to consider.
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:11:54
Ha just read my comment back....that was meant to read "you are NOT demolishing my dreams here....." 
Anyway that said, my motive for proposing this service was to attain bitcoins at a steady rate without normal associated costs. My thoughts were that if I was to pop a few extra items in the trolley when I did my weekly shop then my shopping would be marginally subsidised. In addition to this, I'd be contributing something the the bitcoin community that as a non coding/ non techie in general have been racking my brain as to how to get involved.
I may consider a simple blog style website offering my service with the option to pay via paypal or something like that and offer discounts for bitcoin. 
The prices that britishcornerstore charge are ridiculous, the postage costs exploitive and the products are limited to what they have on the website (you can suggest products, but presumably they will check the demand and decide if it is viable) surely there has to be a space for me in there?

Why would the paying in bitcoin be the hard sell part? The very high p&amp;p fees on the britishcornershop website would still be preferably avoided, no? Like I say this was kind of a 'shower thought', my research into alternatives is limited.

I see your point. But the scale of what I was proposing means that if you particular penchant was Tesco shop brand lemonade, I doubt that ex pat shops around the world are likely to stock it. As a personal shopper I could buy whatever you asked for (within reason). 
Also, as an example, Britishcornershop charge, for say a 360g jar of branston pickle ; £2.09 + £39.99 p&amp;p. If you buy 4 jars total price would be the £8.36 + £49.99 p&amp;p. Now, there is no price adjustment for buying a bigger jar, there is no opportunity to take advantage of store promotions and for the same shipment (i.e) up to 2 kg via royal mail 5-7days service the postage would cost £12.95 and the branston pickle itself from asda, 2x720g jars = £3.90.
British corner stores = 8.36+49.99
My service = 3.9+12.95 + packaging +10%
I'll admit there are limitations to 2kg before prices ramp up as far as I can see at quick glance....

You borrow them, at an agreed interest rate, you sell them if you think price is heading down, you re purchase if the price goes down and give them back (with the interest) and pocket the profit.

Oh okay. So whereas at present I use a debit or credit card and the retailer pays to receive the funds, using this "service" I have to pay for the privilege to pay. In fact using Bitpay or just transferring money with most other wallets I only incur a miner fee......the idea of paying 2% contradicts any other experience that I have had when making purchase except for that of a charge for using a credit card sometimes or a fee for using a cash machine at a petrol station, perhaps.

"Each transaction that you process using our service is subject to a transaction fee. Our current transaction fees are: 1% of the transaction amount for sales and 2% of the transaction amount for purchases."
Does this actually mean that each time that I buy or sell something in exchange for bitcoin that it costs ME?

I think people, quite broadly, are losing faith in the system of government. However institutions backed by governments and vice versa are powerful and can get things done. I think most people are apathetic, do not want to be anarchistic for fear of complication and accept that convenience comes at the price of privacy. Bitcoin is not solely about value transfer but that is what people, if they know anything about Bitcoin, is its primary function.
 The Bitcoin space has changed so much in the shirt time I have been familiar with it, I am still trying to understand it all what with not being from a tech background. When I first became familiar with Bitcoin in 2012 it had an underground feel to it, cult like but in this short time, there has been regulations proposed, finance ministers embracing and Wall street interest. I don't think Bitcoin will face bans but I do think they will try and tame it and train it.

I listened to an interesting podcast from NPR, Planet money. They gave a brief insight as to how 3 trillion was locked away in the banks and those banks are paid 1% interest for......just sitting on it. The idea being is that the FED magic up money, buy....in this case mortgage bonds although traditionally they buy treasury bonds....and debit the banks with the newly printed money....
I confess that I don't fully understand how this lubricates an economy and am still enjoying learning the complexities of a monetary system. But the idea, as I understand is that normally quantitive easing pumps more money into the economy, the purchasing power is reduced thereby offer an incentive for people to part with their money and the economy is kick started into people spending, people making and selling, businesses growing and paying taxes la la la...
How giving banks newly minted money to hold in exchange for toxic debt that caused the meltdown 8 years ago, paying them money to sit on it until a time whereby they take it back and tra-la...everything is fixed??
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:40:22
Ok, that's all I needed to know. I had mistakenly read it as incurring a fee for using the bitcoins in my wallet to make a purchase. Not, as you have made clear that purchasing bitcoins using their service. I thought it seemed strange and it was a genuine question.

I have a few stag do's to attend this year and one of the bones of contention seems to be gathering the money from everyone for there share of accommodation etc. So if there was a fund that could have a link at the bottom of an email or whatever that people went to and contributed their share then I could see that as being useful. I don't know many people who use bitcoin....yet but it seems like a real world case that would be solved with this method. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:56:40
No....that ain't gonna work is it. However, there are expenditures that are wholly necessary, there are expenditures that are motivated by desire and then there are expenditures that are for investment purposes. Art, antiques, land/property, gold/jewellery......some of which in the last category are also desirable or even necessary.....a home, a wedding ring, a lovely picture. Seems though, that a large chunk of the last category would be the only one affected....even as I type this I am reconsidering each aspect.....property and land are also finite resource and likely to simply retain  a certain "price" and not go down under a deflationary money supply system... Maybe I should read the damn article....then I could stop flapping about, trying to figure it out from scratch........
@_date: 2015-10-26 12:38:51
I'll be damned if I am going to drag my through an article that opens with a title that basically equates to jibberish...
@_date: 2015-10-25 18:36:54
That maybe the thinking, but the interest that they are being paid is to literally sit on the money. So it doesn't touch their balance sheet as far as I could make out from the podcast. Here in the UK the banks are required to make more stringent requirements for money lending. ..so they are not even using it to "sure" up their accounts and lend it out....they are, to my mind, getting paid to nurse some cash......I don't know why this is beneficial?
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:07:29
Devils advocate here, but isn't the argument; Inflation - buy now because price is rising opposed to deflation - wait for as long as possible because it will get cheaper (as will everything else)
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:47:36
True, don't aspire to be the richest person in the graveyard. People who hang on to money seem to do so, even when inflation is prevelant.
@_date: 2015-03-05 11:25:08
Not true. When the automobile was invented people were cautious and sometimes scared of these horseless carts. Cars were complicated to drive and at first were only able to travel at very low speed. Roads that had been built with horses in mind were bumpy and combined with the very poor suspension, the ride was nauseating. Cars were required to travel slowly and have people waving a flag as it travelled to alert everyone to its presence. I can't imagine that more than a small number of people, probably regarded as eccentrics saw any future for cars at the time at which they first became a rare sight!
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:46:35
Yes, this is a great point. One of the biggest things I love about Bitcoin is that it has really motivated me to consider and to learn new things. I would have unlikely ever given deflation true consideration before. Your message arrived in line with my thought that the desire to buy, for example, a new release games console is unlikely to be affected by the fact that by merely retaining the money required to purchase it in hope of more purchasing power in the future.

Agreed! Bitcoin seems to offer "another" option. Competition to the status quo, money can now be a commodity in itself and the best or preferred option can prevail. bitcoins were unlikely to come along and everyone just instantly change. bitcoins offers an alternative way to measure value and like other measuring systems, like weights ie; imperial, metric etc. some will stick to one and others will adopt another......like the perfectly good example of ac and dc!

In about april of this year I sold a few 0.1 btc and 0.01 btc via ebay/paypal and got 'scammed' for 0.2 out of 1.0btc. Paypal cover you only for physical transactions and sending screenshots of blockchain and wallet transactions is no help. I'm afraid to say it sounds like you may have to notch this one down to experience and learn the lesson of only ever gamble what you can afford to lose. But in saying that, you should attempt a cordial exchange in hope that they are not experienced with bitcoin wallets and that you may be able to assist them. Good luck.

What is your purpose for continually knocking bitcoin, you clearly follow it very closely. I'm not saying you are wrong to do so, you may guess right for all I know or for all anyone knows....just seems strange that you hang around here everyday, only ever spouting negative 'opinions', other than some attention, I can't fathom your intention. There are clearly many other people that are enthusiastic/optimistic about bitcoin evolution and dare I say have vested interest, but at least that explains their motivation....
