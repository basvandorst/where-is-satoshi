Never go "all in" on any single asset.  If you keep rolling dice with no hedge, eventually you lose everything you've made.  Not saying BTC's going down, just saying "all in" on anything is a bad investment strategy.

@_date: 2018-03-15 09:46:20
Actually, it is trading that propels the price further down. Manipulators are rampant, and ownership is centralized, but ultimately if you anticipate the market correctly, you are selling just before a breakout and buying just above a breakdown. this means that whichever way the trends point, that's the way the market continues. Traders reinforce market momentum until a breakout actually occurs. With the market moving down right now, good trading will inevitably push the price lower. That is especially true if you are shorting

tyvm.  So, he talks about negative interest rates as a way to incentive spending money, but doesn't an inflationary currency do the same thing? Also, wouldn't negative interest rates also disincentivize willingness to loan money (not that that is all bad lol 2008 cough')

Sentiment is the market. If the price gets pushed down too far too fast, it will fall farther and possibly stay down, regardless of fundamentals. Current levels are well known, 8.3 where it just bounced from, 7.2, 6.8, 6, etc. on down. The thing is, in order to get a real bounce, you need total panic in one direction, followed by panic in both, AND it has to be concentrated in order to reach critical mass. Everyone complains about the Mt. Gox guy crashing the market, but NO ONE ever mentions that it was probably his panic selling at the bottom, causing insane volumes, that gave crypto the mass to pop up far enough to gain more mass and more traction, enough to look like and then (thus) become a partial recovery. With it bouncing all the way down like it is now, it may not ever gain enough traction to get trend-breaking bounce. This is called a bear market, and it is exacerbated and perpetuated by the way traders trade it, namely by buying major supports but then selling at a lower high each time there's a bounce. Eventually most people despair and move on, false bounce after false bounce, until it flat-lines and volitility and volume disappear. Then even the traders move on. Only then can sentiment begin to turn positive again. But still, I'm buying every dip, lol. Crypto for life. Bear market is just a chance for new tech to overtake btc and then the world.

They don't quite have the power to do that, tho they do do it on a small scale, daily swings to some degree when thing work out. The things are, when talking about whales, they have a lot of volume to move, and there is more than one of them. They fight and try to trick each other, just as they all try to trick us.

I don't really mind the article's premise, but this is just atrocious: "For the month of March, that $8,000 level has proven to be a key battleground on the trading front, having fallen below it several times since February. Technical analysis suggested that a price drop was potentially in the cards,". Literally some of the most meaningless garbage I've ever seen written. In fact, enough so that I lol'ed. Every price that BTC has crossed multiple times is by that definition a battleground. And TA suggesting that it was possible for the price to drop was just absolutely the most useful thing I've ever heard

@_date: 2018-03-11 07:29:46
It's true. As an investment, decentralized cryptocurrency still has an extremely worthwhile risk-to-reward ratio, enough to put some real net worth in long-term.  Risking 2% for a possible gain of 10000% is worth it as long as there is greater than a 1/5000 chance of that happening, especially considering the additional value as a hedge against fiat collapse.  I mean, crypto is bearing right now, and that might continue for 2 days or 2 weeks or 2 months or 2 years, but when it ends and goes back up, there is a reasonable chance it will be as other assets fall, possibly dramatically.

Everything you do, literally everything, is investing/gambling, on the opportunity cost of your time and money at the very least. Selling at the top and buying at the bottom is actually providing a market service, namely efficiency. Traders feed off volatility, and therefore reduce it, and thus they are paid by the market. The "investor" that bought the top and sold the bottom 'ahem' mt.Gox guy 'ahem', was making the market less efficient, trying to increase volatility (knowingly or unknowingly), and so had to pay and then got burned.

in case this is real, guess I'll say be thankful that was only 10k. 10k can fixed with hard work. And you learned the number one lesson of investing, gambling, life: bankroll management.  Anyway, you got lucky, because crypto is 100% guaranteed to go back up; could be a day or a month or years, but it will.  Keep your eyes and ears open.  It will probably still center on BTC, but if the recovery takes long enough, other things might turn out to be an even better investment.  Probably not tho...

@_date: 2018-03-15 08:10:26
that's not how a bear market works. Sentiment and charts drive traders, and they drive the price down. Eventually hodlers see better opportunities for their money elsewhere, over the opportunity cost of leaving it in btc, and they leave as well. eventually the price flattens out, sentiment flattens out, and traders leave. then the market begins real recovery

If a moron like me did it, lots of people did, obviously, and it bounced of the 300 day.

To be fair, that usually happens. However, the big problem comes when you lock in the loss. With btc and some basic TA, there is a good chance your bet can still make good if you have enough patience. At least, that is what I try to avoid. I always wait for my stop-buy to be hit, then sell low on the pull back, then rebuy back at my original stop. That way I am guaranteed the loss. Of course, if you are shorting you want to do that the other way around.

I'm same boat. If you are small time like that, the key is to be in as low as possible. Look for the big drops, you can smell them. Pull out before hand, then stick it back in. lol. And pay a lot of attention to TA and news, as no one remembers that btc has fundamentals in a crash, they just panic sell on TA. Right now the levels to watch close are 8.9, 8-8.4, 7.2-7.5, and 6.8. If it drops below 6.8, we've broken the 300-day MA, and there's a good chance of a bear market. If you are looking for quick one-time profit, buy around a bounce-level and sell early

overvalued where it was, but not necessarily where it is.  And it is important to note that tulips and the above bubbles only burst once. Bitcoin has done it a bunch in the last 10 years, with 40% corrections now hardly even being noticable. It is something different.

@_date: 2018-02-22 20:33:09
Yah, like 50K. But, 11.8 was always going to be resistance. The whale just smartly fed the panic. Even LOL'ed the recovery at 11111 if you look at the graph (or were watching like an owl like me). When we panic sell, it is into his limit buys. Fucker.

snark much lol. If the tea is too bitter, stop following the market. Speculation is the only reason BTC is where it is. It will be worth this much and more EVENTUALLY, but it is not now. We stop, you lose 90% and wait for years for the market to recover. Also traders raise market efficiency here. As you said, one person sells and another buys; every transaction is two sided, with the price point only reflective of consensus, widely negotiated price. But it is all dynamic, just like every market. If you have to, you can look at it this way: without the constant trading, the rises and falls would actually be even more severe, because there would be tremendous build ups of pressure, and then we really would have a bubble. Also, jsut to be fair, daytraders who trade too much do get smoked

@_date: 2018-03-09 07:39:34
word. On the log chart and based on the last bull high, 1K seems reasonable. However, if there is any kind of momentum, it could go lower. logarithmically, from 20K to 5K suggests to be a bear bottom at 1K, but a possible over shoot to as little as 200 or even 50. Doubt it would recover from that. Something else would take its place
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:55:11
I know, right.  Part of the value of the dollar as a medium of exchange is how much it sucks: if you don't dump into something else (something that will probably drive the economy, like investment or purchase), you lose value everyday, both through inflation and opportunity cost.

Agree with his stuff, but have to say there's some good price signals too, like double and triple taps, the tendency to test a new threshold when one is broken (even after a bounce), and how crypto has a real tendency to panic sell through major threshoholds and then immediately rebound (whale panic). Good example might be the drop through 6 to 5.5K in the cashening, then a double tap and immediate rebound to above 6K, at which a cascade of panic buyers drove it up further (though that was greatly propelled by the rumor of futures trading).  The question in dips is, will it end in a panic sell and rebound, or will it be rounded/flat bottom plateau.  Generally I'd say the former, though this might be a special case with the 66% drop.  Might candle down a couple times over the next couple weeks, 7.5, 6, 5.5, 5, and then round just after 5 before coming back. people need a minute to regain faith and then panic buy when it has sunk so far
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:29:35
Bitcoin dips on good news and bad rumors, and vice versa. Also, futures and shorts. Also, whales taking profit and manipulating. Luckily, they are generally predictable if you pay attention. Pay attention. Either grow some balls and trade out the dips, or grow some balls and HODL

Wish for a dip like 6K, with that sharp down and up. Without it, the market will continue to bear for weeks if not months, until exhaustion
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:42:52
next touch would be just above 4500, and if that happens there's a good chance it's going lower and bearing for months ahead. This one was a doozy, but mainly because of the meteoric rise. Though it doesn't look it at a glance, still bouncing off the averages
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:26:20
There are only three reasons to ever sell:
1. You need the money for a purchase
2. You believe bitcoin has reached its ATH and will never go higher.
3. You are looking for a better deal and have strong indicators you are right, AKA trading. Either you sell with the hope of rebuying at a cheaper price, or you invest in altcoins hoping to make a bigger profit than you would with bitcoin. If this third option is your path, it is better than 1 or 2, but good luck beating the market longterm.
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:01:38
lol, no, but $1K maybe
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:25:13
Dunno. Tech undermined pretty much everything except finance. Besides, the ideal is bitcoin existing alongside fiat as competition, though neither side would have you believe that. Longterm, I want a second Gold, that fluctuates relatively independently of other asset classes
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:46:23
Good question.  Are consumerism and growth in the way we've been fed it really that good for us?  Definitely not for most people or the planet in general.  
Still, though, in terms of just our economy, it does seem to me that spending and investing are both superior to saving, and esp. to cold storage hod'l'ing, where the currency isn't even being loaned out (or invested / loaned out by the exchange/bank with whom it is invested).  I'm just wondering, I guess, as many have that I've seen recently, if the very nature of the speculation inhibits its ability to be correct speculation?  I mean, I am not spending my coin.  I never would unless I had too, and not because it's not accepted by vendors, but because it is too valuable as a hod'l.

I love crypto, despite the trollish title. And I don't expect this to be as much of an issue once prices stabilize. I'm still new to this, and I just haven't seen this particular nuance argued much.  I understand the arguments about gov't's not being able to regulate the economy as effectively, or about bubbles, or about pow vs pos, but they don't fundamentally undermine the very point of cryptocurrency: actually using it.

But that's what I'm wondering: Doesn't the current speculation limit transaction, the value of transaction, and thus the value of bitcoin as a transactional currency, as opposed to a store of speculative value?
And of course, people will still spend when they need to, but will they spend when they don't?  I won't.  The money I would spend on entertainment or investment in securities (the sellers of which then generally use the cash themselves rather than holding it), I am instead using to buy crypto because of its extremely high speculative value.  I and my money are not contributing to the economy the way we otherwise would be if I wasn't hod'l'ing crypto.

the question always is, will others follow suit
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:21:53
dunno if its to that point yet. Unless they margin traded or got in at the very top, they should still have most of their investmetn remaining. lol, tho if they mortgaged their house, they might be pissed

Yah, I keep expecting all the good news to overwhelm the negative sentiment, especially since most of the bad news is extremely questionable anyway. Sometimes I wonder if the best thing for crypto would be for it to be made fully illegal. Instantaneously all the possible bad news would be on the table, and the market would drop and then bottom out. Literally, there would be no more bad news or even sentiment to FUD on. People would invest everything they have in it and then hodl crypto the way Americans hodl guns. Nothing increases popularity like banning something, lol.

Unless he's trading, in which he should sell some at the tops. Or rational, in which case he should watch for signs when something is overtaking bitcoin, if that ever happens.
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:39:57
ditto! Got out last night before the major manipulation and climb, and missed the whole thing from 10.1 on up. Was literally on the edge of calling it and buying in just now at 10.4 with a stop at 10.25. On Gdax, so wouldn't have gotten super rekt, but still... lol timing, can be bad, can be good, and never know which
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:48:58
Not only that, someone fcked up on margin and now set 7500 BTC to try to push the price down further. Someone's getting assassinated tonight, lol. What is that, like 40mil?
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:57:58
yah, it's been manipulation the whole time, since the fall at 11.8 at least. haven't you been watching?
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:32:39
his stuff about secular cycles is interesting, but doesn't really hold water here, as bitcoin is just one currency in the cryptomarket, and as the market is just starting. Accelerated as everything is in this space, that still seems unlikely. What is much more likely is the trough in a normal 'shortterm' bear market, where we go up in a couple waves back to 13K but then fall down next month to 5K, and to 1K eventually.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:18:02
"it goes to 10 and then back to 3. compared to that, this is nothing"
Don't get me wrong, I'm in it, but this was literally that: 20K to 6K is exactly the same ratio. That those in power or PR can't do basic math scares me
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:59:16
is that too trollish? should I delete the fake 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:45:09
People don't usually dump crypto because it doesn't have enough speculative value longterm.  They trade out a dip in hopes of buying in at lower price.  Sure, people panic sell, and one of these times when there's real news driving it it will crash the market and bitcoin will no longer be such a hot speculative investment (lol, though that's debatable), but until then the money in it does nothing except drive higher prices and more energy consumption in mining it.  In a way, it a perfect piece of purified capitalistic speculation: it pulls money from the productive economy, while producing nothing itself. lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:53:11
Absolutely, and that is the longterm point of crypto: you are paid in crypto, you buy in crypto, and crypto is relatively stable price-wise against things like usd (or cpi, for that matter).  But short-term, I get paid in dollars and I am going to use them to buy more crypto, both because usd sucks as a store of value and because crypto is going up way faster than the value of almost anything else. 
In crypto, not buying a chair today means having enough to buy 2 chairs ia month from now.  In dollars, not buying a chair now probably means only having enough for 0.999 chairs a month from now. Now, obviously I'm not accounting for the depreciation of the chair, but neither am I for the value that month of a chair bring to me, not the use of my money in other ventures after it has passed on from me.
