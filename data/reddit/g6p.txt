Yes, KeePass does do that. It has an auto-submit feature just like the other password managers.
Thankfully, this feature can be turned off in all the password managers that have the auto-submit feature. From the source you posted:

My favorite part about your post is how you make an absurd statement and then go on to provide a source, to supposedly support said statement, that completely contradicts it.
OP, you can use 1Password. The only thing btcner's link says you should consider NOT doing is having 1Password auto-submit your login information because phishing sites could "trick" it and other password managers (Including KeePass!) into submitting your passwords where you don't want them submitted.

Is this tech similar to what Wuala was based on?

Correct, but who is ultimately responsible for the goods? The merchant chose USPS, not the consumer. The consumer shouldn't be responsible for fighting it out with USPS, the merchant should.

They do now, but when the client originally came out you donated some of your HD to the "swarm" and bits of data were distributed throughout the network. In return, you got a certain amount of storage space based on the amount you donate multiplied by some number that was based on the time your HD space was accessible by the network.

On the other hand, chargebacks can be a great consumer protection.
Allow me to play Devil's advocate.
I just ordered a decently expensive object a few months ago and the company decided to ship the object USPS (Always a mistake). They purchased tracking and it shows the item was delivered to my house, only I wasn't there at the time. I live in the shady part of a big city and the USPS branch is even shadier (They don't leave notices - they just send packages back after sitting in their branch for a few weeks without any attempt to deliver). So maybe they left it out in the open in broad daylight, or maybe they never actually delivered it at all.
Without chargebacks I would've taken the hit for a product I never received. 
The company who delivers the product should be responsible for talking to USPS to determine what happened and why the product was not successfully delivered to the customer, not the customer who never received it.

I wouldn't be so sure about "guaranteed" - bitcoin is a disruptive piece of decentralized computing that just might have in it the seeds necessary to bring institutions antagonistic to a socioeconomically equal society to their knees. Being interested in such a tool doesn't necessarily imply belief that capitalism is the optimal economic model, which is the impression I get from many of the more vociferous users of bitcoin.
Off-topic edit: I'd like to clarify for a few of the other commenters that it is rare to find individuals who follow the anarchist (aka libertarian socialist/anarcho-communist/syndicalist) tradition who are purely anti-hierarchy, if what you mean by hierarchy is authority. There is justified authority and unjustified authority, and the former might imply some natural hierarchy simply by means of differences in knowledge, skill, etc... This is something that should be fostered. The reason anarchists do not believe capitalism is the best path is that those with capital will always seek to create a state in some form in order to protect their wealth. Anarchists believe this is inevitable, and thus capitalism can never lead to a world without unjustified authority or a coercive state in some form.

I used both - Capital One to just put some money in my bitfloor account for use when needed (no fee, but takes 3 days) and BoA if I need it right away (small fee)

1. You mention Localtill, does this mean you're having problems only with the Localtill deposit mechanism? If so, you should mention that in your title, as there are two other ways to deposit (CapitalOne360 and wire transfer) that fellow Redditors could be using that might be completely bug-free at the moment.
2. You say "peoples" - could you link to other people having this problem so us Redditors can get an idea if this is an isolated incident or something more systemic?
FWIW I deposited into BoA via Localtill yesterday at around 11 AM EST and had the money in my account within 15 minutes.

As of this moment bitcoin is most certainly pegged to fiat currency; ignoring the importance of this exchange price is simply to ignore reality. Until supply chains providing goods for sale in bitcoin expand to include every step from the raw materials to the end consumer bitcoin's value will remain partially pegged to fiat currency.

Maria Bustillos is an amazing writer - I was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the byline. I went ahead and sent her a DM on Twitter asking her if she had a wallet we could send some BTC to. Received this message back:

If you used CapitalOne360 I'd check your account with them. I did a LocalTill and a CapitalOne360 deposit on the same day - the LocalTill deposit went through in less than 15 minutes and I just realized today that the CapitalOne360 deposit was reversed by Capital One. I'm still unsure why that happened.

Wikipedia is arguably the most important website on the Internet. It also happens to rely on donations to function.
Every day on we see another person or organization being shut out of their bank accounts for transactions with bitcoin businesses. Do we honestly expect the most important wealth of knowledge in the history of the world to risk its very existence on the ability to take bitcoin donations?
When they think it is safe for them to do so, it will happen. Until then, just give through BitPay. If you want to sit on your high horse with the rest of the bitcoin condescension crew, be my guest, but you'll be in the minority and the rest of us will be supporting a foundation that makes history every day.

I haven't gotten back to it - the test wallet in question has about $0.04 worth of BTC on it. I'll grab the address and post it here so you (or anybody else) can see if it decrypts with the password I provided.
And yes, I used the same browser for encrypting and decrypting.

My name is bitfloor customer A and I use Reddit. Yesterday I made a transfer of funds from my CapitalOne360 account to bitfloor. Lo and behold I go to and see a thread titled "WARNING: Do not send money to Bitfloor" and I become worried. It turns out, there just might be a problem with LocalTill, but thanks to spodie_odee having more interest in in fearmongering than informative titles I started calling/e-mailing/tweeting Bitfloor endlessly to find out if my money is safe. As a result, everybody else that might actually be having a problem has to wait that much longer for a response.
EDIT: As an aside - no, you didn't pay Bitfloor to perform a service. Bitfloor doesn't take a dime of your money from the Localtill transfer. Localtill does. So, in fact, Localtill is who you paid for a service and by your logic you should be complaining about/to them.

I just realized this happened to me. The deposit was "picked up" quite some time ago but was subsequently reversed by CapialOne. It still shows up as a pending deposits on bitfloor, but has been completely reversed on CapitalOne's end.

From what I understand the fee is between 1-4% and they verify your deposit based on this exact amount, so some people keep making LocalTill deposit requests until they get 1% fee and delete the rest.

Dropbox is fine even if it's not on a truecrypt volume. Your wallet itself is behind a large private key, your Dropbox account should be behind a large password (kept in a program like 1Password, which itself should have a large password) and two-factor authentication. Even if somebody got access to your Dropbox account (which means they have your Dropbox account name/password, your phone, and the code that is needed to access your locked phone) and deleted your wallet, you can recover files that have been deleted with no problem once you regain access.

With respect to the first statement, I can only consider "you can never delete it" as a plus. As for the second, that's probably true, but that's just about true for everything, so I'm not sure it's a valid point. Like I said above, you'd have to jump through so many technical and physical hoops to get access to my wallet that I'm not sure it's conceivably possible, and I take exactly 0 extraordinary precautions.

Are there currently any limits on selling, or just purchasing?
