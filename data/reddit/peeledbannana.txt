We all go though that. I actually managed to lose about 60 percent of my initial investment by being too schizophrenic and panicking every time the price moved against me. Thankfully I managed to make it back by keeping my cool and now I'm slightly in the green. Investing and trading is a great way to build your character, imo.

Oh, you meant to compensate for the inflation. Makes sense, but I don’t know if the mined coins will have an immediate effect on the price, I doubt miners will start selling them immediately.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:57:30
Where did you get that from?
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:55:21
Unless they are a miner, there’s nothing they can do to accelerate the transaction (and even then, it’s debatable how much they could help). It’s a scam.

Head and shoulders forming, Bitcoin is crashing. My totally rigorous and definitely not made up TA says so.
(I'm being sarcastic, in reference to all the "pros" from a few weeks ago who were talking about the head and shoulders pattern Bitcoin was in after the drop from $20k to $10k.)

This is a good one, I'm going to remember it for next time someone brings up H&amp;S. 
Btw, in case you missed my comment in this thread, I was being sarcastic. ��

The very high Bitcoin transaction fees make decentralized exchanges very unattractive, unfortunately. I wish it wasn't this way. The technical limitation could potentially be fixed though, but another disadvantage that they have, which I think is fundamental and cannot be fixed, is that they don't offer leveraged trading.

Man, you shouldn't have reminded me about HL3. :( Now I'm going to have to go check the Steam forums to see if there were any more leaks in 2017.

It's not clear what you're asking. Are you asking about margin trading?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:57:40
Multiple keys wouldn't help you save money on fees. The fees have to be paid every time, regardless of what address you send them to. Btw, after you create your wallet and transfer the coins you can use blockchain.info to check your balance. For example, here's the wallet of someone with a shit-ton of coins:

Bitcoin has been going straight up for about a month now. It started to become really risky, because it made people euphoric and when the market would eventually fall and you didn't know how bad people would panic, you didn't really have any good idea of where it would stop. Now that the market did fall, two good things are happening:
- a new base price for Bitcoin is forming, meaning you can have a more reasonable idea of what the coin is valued at, and
- a lot of "weak hands" are exiting, meaning the new base price is being held by people with a bit more patience.
A piece of advice for the future: don’t buy when the price approaches a round number. In absence of any real fundamentals, there tends to be a lot of psychological resistance around those levels.

Can you imagine being this poor sucker? I'm rooting for him to find it now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:45:06
Just because Bitcoin is going to probably be a big part of our lives in the future that doesn't mean it's in the near future. At the moment this space is full of people who got into Bitcoin because they want to make money and the value is way above its utility. I fully expect Bitcoin to have the same trajectory that gold has had since the 1980s: significant crash after people got too excited, then a slow recovery.

Again, if someone is short then someone else has to be long, so why wouldn't it even out?

@_date: 2017-12-02 15:13:13
Some of psychological effects can have real-world consequences in the future. The more high profile players get involved with Bitcoin, the more people will see Bitcoin as an actual asset rather than just a toy. At some point Bitcoin can have enough credibility that average people will feel comfortable using it, allowing entrepreneurs to build business around it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:49:09
Bitcoin is not untraceable or anonymous it's pseudonymous, meaning your identity is not directly associated with any Bitcoin address. However, given that all Bitcoin transactions are public, your identity can be inferred from your wallet's activity.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:36:05
That’s exactly the point that this guy is making. He’s encouraging people to think for themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:52:11
1) If you want to have multiple addresses, then in the most simple setup, yes, you will need a new private key for each address. There is a cryptographic algorithm that generates a new public-private key pair from a single master key, but I don't know of any wallets that implement it.
2) More addresses means greater security because if you lose the private key to one of them you won't compromise all your Bitcoins. On the other hand, it is a lot more cumbersome to deal with multiple addresses. Your call.
3) To be clear, the Bitcoins are never on your computer or in your hardware wallet. It is on the network (in the "cloud"). All you have in your computer is a private key that can you use to "prove" that you are the owner of the coins. But to get back to your question, if you can use the cold storage to make transactions on a different computer, then that means your private key was successfully copied to the storage and you can delete it from your computer.
3a/b). I would argue that it is. Technically, all you need to keep safe is your private key, because you can use that to generate your public address. But if you don't know how to do it, it's better to just store both the private and public keys somewhere safe. A piece of paper is fine as long as you keep it safe.

At least in the short term it's only going to be a psychological signal, you are right.

I'm not sure this is a good meme. It implies that this is the highest it can go.

Interesting. Anything that would help us give credibility to this?

I used to be on Bitfinex, which is great from a technical point of view: very fast, high volume, a lot of order types and many currency pairs. However I wouldn't recommend Bitfinex because they are unregulated and seem to be involved in some fraudulent activity regarding Tethers, and I don't want to have to worry about me not being able to withdraw my money if shit goes south.
Right now I'm on Kraken. They offer 5:1 leverage and they are based in California, meaning you can be assured that they are properly regulated. On the other hand, they suck from a technical point of view: really bad infrastructure (you sometimes have to place orders multiple times because they don't get registered the first time), poor user interface, and only very basic order types (market and limit).
If I were you I would look into Trading 212 and Plus500 as well, since they are well regulated.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:56
If your ambitions are based on uninformed people piling in you're not going to go very far.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:01:18
I'm not using it, but I still wanted to get out of Bitfinex because if USDT turns out to be a scam there's a good chance that Bitfinex will crash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:17:58
Pff, one time I lost $2000 in 30 minutes (not in Bitcoin). The irony is that I wasn’t even wrong about the trend, but I lost money because I underestimated how high the volatility would be. I was doing margin trading and had to bail out before the liquidation price was reached. Trading can really train you to control your emotions.

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:26:28
You know what I meant.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:54:55
Also, look a bit into the exchange to see if they are reliable. Bitfinex, for example, might be the largest exchange and with the most liquidity, but it's unregulated and they seem to be involved in some fraudulent stuff. Right now I'm using Kraken, which is not ideal because it only has market and limit orders, and their infrastructure kind of sucks. The upside is that they are based in California, and being in the US you can have a higher degree of certainty that they are properly regulated.

"Mai Fujimoto ... started investing in Bitcoin back in the year 2011 when Bitcoin’s price was roughly around $10, a price that has jumped more than 500% since."
More like 500 times, not 500 percent. I guess it was too unbelievable so they thought it must have been a mistake and corrected it. ��

Because that would be stupid if you think one month from now Bitcoin is going to be 20% more valuable. Basically, everything you buy would be 20% more expensive if you pay with Bitcoin. In oder for something to be usable as a currency it has to have a very high level of stability, which Bitcoin does not have.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:53:35
Are you talking about this one? 
BTC had just reached an ATH and when that happens there tends to be a sell-off. Nothing special.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:09:47
Definitely. BCH and BTC are not that different technologically, at least not from a fundamental point of view. If BCH comes up with some groundbreaking innovation it'd be rather easy for BTC to implement it as well.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:40:20
Gold is a good store of value because its price is very stable and its value is not given by any government (all cultures value gold and they have been doing so for millennia). On the other hand, gold is a terrible medium of exchange: it's heavy and cannot be used for billions of small transactions all over the globe.
The same argument can be made for Bitcoin. BTC has very slow transaction times and we don't know if it's possible to fix them. On the other hand, being decentralized means that its value is given by a social contract and not by a government, meaning it cannot be easily taken away.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:04:08
Given how shady the people behind BCH are, it's very hard for me to say. Maybe BCH is going to have a good reputation again in the future, so I don't want to say that I'll never be interested in it. At the same time, the bar is so high for me right now that it's hard to even imagine what it would take trust BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:29:21
So we've reached the point when statesmen take Bitcoin seriously enough to try to make arguments against it. This is great news.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:43:20
That's really not a lot of money. If you lose it then no big deal, but on the other hand the potential gains are much greater. I wouldn't hesitate at all.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:00:25
The bank probably wouldn't consider Bitcoin a safe collateral, and they would be right. You're probably going to make a loan over a fairly long period of time and the bank's going to want to be fairly certain that your collateral's still going to be worth as much in a few years (or a few decades, depending on how big the loan is). 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:04:06
*Cautious* is the word I would use. The growth that Bitcoin has seen this past summer is scary so I'm going to manage my risks carefully, but that doesn't mean I'm going to stay out of the game.

@_date: 2017-11-21 00:19:12
IOTA and Ethereum are two that I keep my eyes on. Both are technologically different from Bitcoin and from each other so they have potential to grow without having to fight with Bitcoin. More importantly, they both have some good people behind them.
In short, the Ethereum network can be used to create decentralized contracts, giving the potential for some interesting financial instruments or companies to be built on top of it. IOTA offers zero-fee transactions and it's built for massive scalability. The intent is to make it *the* medium of exchange for micro-transactions on the IOT.

Statistically, it would take more than the lifetime of a human to mine one block with consumer hardware. That's slightly over your threshold of five to six months, I would say.

I live in the Netherlands as well. I'm currently using Bitfinex, but other good options are Trading 212 and Plus500.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:01:42
I believe it will at some point in 2018. It might go somewhere in the $3,000 to $4,000 range, after which it will slowly start to build up again and sometime in the future explode to highs that today you would find ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:41:26
Really weird things are happening these days. Bitfinex was also down for a couple of minutes an hour or so ago.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:14:19
There are two options that I can see. Either someone is trying to manipulate the market and push the price of Bitcoin up, or they have a lot of money that they want to invest into Bitcoin and they are doing cost averaging (buy in small chunks over a period of time, to minimize the risk).
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:46:05
I would go for one of the more traditional exchanges, such as Trading 212 or Plus500.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:41:33
With consumer hardware you'll, on average, manage to mine a block every few hundred years. I'm not exaggerating.

One of the most corrupt countries there is doesn't like Bitcoin. I guess that's a good reason to get into Bitcoin.

Curious about this as well.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:53:30
I started with Kraken but I found that a lot of errors were happening and I would have to submit an order multiple times before it was accepted — very frustrating when you want to react quickly to a price change.
Right now I'm using Bitfinex, which is great because it has a lot of coins that you can trade and I've never had any network or technical issues with it. That being said, I'm not very confident in Bitfinex. In September a few accounts were hacked and they lost their coins. Instead of paying for their own mistake, Bitfinex decided to spread the losses and debited everyone else's accounts to cover the lost coins.
Now I'm looking for a US based exchange. They are much more regulated and they inspire a lot more confidence, in my opinion. The problem is that not a lot of US exchanges support my home country.
All this being said, if your intent is to buy and hold, then the exchange doesn't matter that much. This is because you should withdraw your coins from the exchange and store them in your wallet, which offers maximum security.
**Edit:** I'm also considering one of the more traditional exchanges such as Trading212 or Plus500.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:18:14
Man, that sucks. ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:28:08
I don't see Bitcoin ever becoming a medium of exchange. It's just way too slow for that and the problem seems to be at a fundamental level. If Bitcoin is to survive for the long haul it needs to become a *stable* store of value; that means we'll have to be happy with what we have (a great *decentralized* store of value) and say goodbye to the constant growth. If the value keeps going up forever it's just bound to crash at some point.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:45:51
It doesn't matter that the coins are not lost. It's obvious that the intent is to mislead and the app should be down voted based solely on that.
