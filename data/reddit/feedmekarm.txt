Maybe a reason for why tether is dropping? Just a thought

Using buyers versus sellers is the same as using demand versus supply. By cutting some of the sellers coins in half we make it harder for them to react to demand from the buyers. If the demand stays the same you wouldn’t see much price change until there is an increase from the buyers which then, in turn, makes the price to increase.

True! How do you think that will effect demand?

Right, the new supply of bitcoin being created is the reward from mining. Correct?

I agree in part. Since supply will be more inelastic, Demand will actually only have to increase less for it to still have the same amount of affect as it did before. And if we assume a portion of the minors will switch from mining to purchasing and the exchange, that could be the demand that I’m talking about that could increase the price.

Not necessarily. During recessions people invest in assets like gold. If you were to think of bitcoin as “digital gold” then it would be the opposite of your train of thought.

So I sort of disagree.  Reducing the supply rate does not necessarily mean prices will increase if people are buying at regular intervals such as monthly purchases. There is no shift in demand and only a chance in elasticity of supply. But if demand were to increase, the price would increase at a higher rate. This is all under the assumption that the price isn’t already baked into this theory.
