Some people view bitcoin as a good investment to make more fiat but viewing it as a plan b for fiat is definitely the more logical and revolutionary

death, taxes and bitcoin adoption

this just shows that bitcoin as a market is still wheening itself slowly from the current system, it's early days buddy but it will be great down the line :)

I even think you're understating it, I can't talk to anyone about cryptos without sounding like an uber nerd wacko but here everyone gets it so perfectly that it makes me feel cool in the best way possible aka moral values represented by maths. 
I mean I don't see anyone who wants to control everyone using bitcoin and the fact you cant is another reason big corporations are underestimating it so grossly

the same way sliced bread did, mild convenience, but as this convenience becomes less valuable the price difference will go down

The slavery described in this quote is more related to QE and the transference of buying power from the many to the few not any military suppression

This should hopefully fuel those of us who feel that at times, guh maybe i'm just a conspiracy lover/optimist. Cryptos aren't like that, aka lets just be happy yo

This should be the crypto anthem

what's the biggest one?
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:30:53
definitely keeping an eye on this, it seems more and more common for people to be taking on these bitcoin pushing projects on their own and I think this is a good thing, good luck!
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:17:29
Keep in mind that you have to compare this to yourself doing this not in your native language, great vid, GO BITCOIN!

Is this not the best thing bitcoin could hope for? how can they not see this? I reckon they have some pretty clever good people in that organisation that convince the idiots at the top to do these counterproductive claims that will destroy mastercard
 they are the unsung heroes
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:43:18
They have created a system where all power is controlled by the market, and because they controlled the market they were happy, but bitcoin is part of the market, and it can only be controlled by everyone, they can only outright remove the power of the market but that removes their own power, they have already lost, checkit matey.

This is great, people are like how can I invest in cryptos with no money or skills, this is one way.

Same! i think it's about how if all banks were actually like this then there would be a lot less motivation behind blockchain in use for currency, but they aren't, so there is.

This is so mind boggling and an exact example of what the future will be like: irony beyond comprehension 
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:06:25
you just made a big step in your understanding of bitcoin brother, cherish it +10 doge
@_date: 2014-11-24 13:16:34
YES! I personally feel that investing in bitcoin simply to profit from it's rising dolla price is counter productive in some ways and that the best investments at the moment is in its acceptance through the world aka educating your peers about the potentials of crypto currency and the block chain, some people see bitcoin and then stop when really it's just the beginning 
@_date: 2014-12-13 19:33:59
Yeah you can't live your life thinking what if, ESPECIALLY with bitcoin, i know a tonne of guys that held off during the big pump of whenevs, the point is that bitcoin is meant to lead to a situation where investing first will not get you the huge advantage that early investment does in the current economy, 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-18 12:47:45
This not only was inevitable but awesome and a sign that we are slowly being saved by eachother/cooperation, it was never about the profit!
@_date: 2015-01-02 13:57:31
It only makes sense that the banking types would want to absorb bitcoin into their reach  and the fact gox died is a testament to the strength of bitcoin, go wildcats!

I shan't deny that the detective picture drew me in
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:06:46
thats fine, you shouldn't judge what you you hear by who said it anyway you should research the ideas behind what was said instead, but yeh i getchya keep sharp! +5
