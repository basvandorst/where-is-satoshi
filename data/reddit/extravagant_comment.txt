.2% if you are making a $1000 transaction. if you were buying a $15 game it would be 11%. if you were buying a $1 coffee it would be 65%.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:19:19
I meant as a percentage of money spent. it can never exceed 100%. if you spend $2.93 total for the coffee, 65% of it is the transaction fee.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:49:00
Yes, I hold bitcoin core because I hope to get a good return on investment. But for actually spending it, either Ethereum and BCH have lower fees and nearly instantaneous transaction times.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:23:41
it's way too volatile to store value. no one knows if bitcoin core will even be worth $1000 10 years from now. or $5000. maybe also $100,000. it's not a store of value, it's a gamble.

is anyone actually buying that Libra is anything more than Facebook credits?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:31:55
0.0001% of the population owning 99% of all bitcoin does not scream "decentralization" to me.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:42:10
they'd have to already have 100 btc, and give it to himself.

something tells me laszlo is still a crypto multi millionaire. a guy who tosses ten thousand of something at a pizza probably has a lot more than ten thousand to begin with.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:31:42
**Pizza for dollars?**
I'll pay $1,809,175,000 for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day.  I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.  You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for $1,809,175,000 where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!
I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that.  I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.
If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.

There are many things I don't like in this article. The first one being of course the author's completely transparent intentions of just making easy money with bitcoin instead of actually believing in the system. if we just hoard and hoard and never use it, how is it a currency and not a glorified pet rock? or should we should just wait for the market to hit the trillions and only then start spending? but how will we know we're there? also:


excuse my french but that is just retarded. bitcoin has never been *less* convenient. the fees are in the tens of dollars, transaction times can take 10+ hours, at any given time there are 100,000+ pending transactions clogging up the blocks.
If bitcoin means nothing more that hoarding it and convincing more and more people to also buy and hoard it, then it *is* a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:45:23
more like Igoto Lotamoni am I right

posts like these is why I didn't buy at 1k. then at 8k. then at 10k.
I DON'T WANNA BUY THE ALL TIME HIGH BUT THEY ARE NOTHING **BUT** ALL TIME HIGHS

if a benevolent entity started mining like crazy for free, would it solve the problem?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:13:38
so the bitcoin are never moving from Kraken to my wallet, they just move from Kraken to the company's channel and they give me a spending credit? that's terrifying.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:33:15
well, maybe not in the early years. but if you are using to get daily coffee you are losing half of it in transaction fees
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:47:22


that's difficult to believe when a minuscule percentage of people holds almost all of Bitcoin. it's a currency that is even less evenly distributed than fiat. besides, with the prices being so speculative, only the rich can afford it atm.

I will never not laugh at "spam the memepool"

if it had steadily increased from 10k to 14.8k everyone would be happy, but the spike to 19k had everyone scared

you're right I have one too many zeroes, but instead of fixing it I'll just wait a few months and it will be right again

not a bad idea to hoard small-ish amounts on an exchange to avoid transfer fees, and only move them to a wallet when balance is high enough
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:57:47
we can always create more airplanes, unlike bitcoins which is a limited supply.

NOT label them Jan-10, Jan-11 etc ?
@_date: 2019-08-16 00:21:11
No worries. A better titling would be "August 15 through the years", and each individual point would be labeled "2010", "2011", "2012", etc.
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:12:07
how do these work? there is just a secret key on the back?
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:19:34


~~That is not how to interpret this data at all. the "98.17%" figure says nothing about being profitable if you hodled. That number is only applicable if you DIDN'T hodl, that is if you bought on any given day AND sold at the end of that same day. that is called day trading, and is much harder to pull off that this graph would have you believe.~~
nvm I read it completely wrong
@_date: 2019-06-09 20:07:52
I don't like this because social medias are garbage that we are now stuck with.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:15:35


I just don't see this happening. So many people are biting themselves for not buying the 3k dip, if it comes back down even close to that there will be a lot of buyers.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:59:18
why is 21 a special number?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:36:18
with most online fees that wouldn't even yield a profit

it weighs 22 pounds in hundred bills, less than gold but not by that much.
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:46:01
Only if you mess up. If you actually catch it, it leads to a totally rad ninja move, and also now you have a knife.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:12:20
there is also the insane idea that some alt coins offer an alternative to compensate bitcoin's tech related limitations such as anonymity, transaction times and transaction fees. I don't think it's unrealistic that 10 years from now we will have wallets sophisticated enough to manage different cryptos and we will be able to choose which to use in our daily lives. Mortgage payment? Bitcoin. Candy bar from a distributor? Ethereum. Tipping the street performer? Dogecoin.

Fuckin way she goes, boys. Sometime she goes, sometimes she doesn't.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:08:00
because when 9 altcoins tank, one randomly soars. for most people it's a losing bet but some skilled traders with inside info know how to juggle alts to make a profit.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:21:22
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:13:59
but all of that is useless when no irl vendors accepts it as payment. the technology is there but infighting between holders of different cryptos is holding everything back.

When u missed buying the dip but it keeps on dipping 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:17:57
how does that work, can you just show them on your phone that you send the payment, or do they actually wait for the transaction to go through before they serve you? in my experience that can take up to two hours.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:42:29
23.9% make between 50-100k ? why are they highlighting what seems like the minority?
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:11:11
I don't like these examples. all of the mentioned companies are just third parties who take a cut out of a crowd sourced service. being the corporate giants that they are, they also stomp the competition.
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:07:41
hopefully one day they are mainstream enough that competition will proliferate and they will have to cut the fees down
