Are you kidding?? This was a clear attack from BTC to BCH! Take a few BTC pumps from miracle over year millionaires (come on, you put in 1000usd in around 2011 and now you're rich???). Just move those funds to the competition and shake it off then go back even bigger.

Anyone know if coinomi will support the new fork?? I think they will since they got on with Bitcoin Cash and all the Ethereum child tokens..

I'm sure they can. From using an ATM near me, all you need is an email address, I think a phone number and your cell phone with a wallet app for the ATM to scan and send the BTC...or some have the option of printing out the BTC like a paper wallet.

So he either deleted the pee-pee part of the bet...or that's a photoshopped screen.

Dude, you can go on play store (if it's Android) and look at the history of previously installed apps on your phone...even if you don't have them installed now. Hopefully you still have your same Google account from way back then....maybe you'll find whatever wallet you were using, or get some idea of what you had and be able to reopen it.

Why does it have those dates? If it's really Bitcoin Cash shouldn't it have started sooner, rather than a whole year ago?

A modern American democracy where everyone fights and bashes each other. Hope it works out in the end.

I'm sure you're fucking with us. So I hope you don't ask for Hangouts because I'll want some too. How the hell can you lose that much? Haven't you heard how much we fucking hate "short" "day" traders? Especially with Bitcoin s fees...jeesus.
