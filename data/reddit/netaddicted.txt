The thing with these debates is that nobody ever mentions what their requirements for a currency are.
For instance, he mentions the fixed amount of bitcoins as an advantage. That doesn't make sense on its down, without saying what function you think is most important for a currency, and how a fixed amount helps with that.
Currency is used as a store of value, as a medium of exchange, as a toolbox for governments to influence their economies (exchange rates, money supply, regulation).
Which are most important is a matter of opinion. But If you want to that currency X is the best, you should als state your preferences.

I was taught about fiat money in Dutch high school. Some money has intrinsic value (like gold), other money (fiat money) is purely based on trust.
The dollar and Bitcoin are both examples of fiat money.

Fractional reserve banking started with gold coins, which couldn't be created either.

Care to explain why? I don't see any particular reason why fractional reserve banking with bitcoin wouldn't be possible.

And  even if you do understand those things, you van stil pref er government-regulated currencies over Bitcoin.

They could do it the same way they do now: if your money is in a bank account, you don't have it anymore and they can lend it out. All you have is an IOU in the form of a bank statement. Because you can still at any moment get your money back (as long as not too many people try at the same time), the IOU is almost as liquid as cash, therefore it counts as money, therefore money has been created.
All of that work with Bitcoin. What doesn't is a central bank saving a bank from a bank run by printing new cash, and als people probably have less incentive to use bank accounts for bitcoin. Although gettin a bit of insurance against theft and a bit of interest is still possible.
The important thing to remember is that it's not the money loaned out that's created, it's the "money" in the bank accounts.

Or a combination of continuous refinancing, plus some inflation. Had been mostly working for most countries for ages.
Shouting "oh no, how will it be paid back" is alarmist, government debt isn't paid back and nobody expects it to be. Why would they ever do that?

We don't know if parachutes work, they never had a proper double-blind test.

Nope, reading and own no bitcoin.

Some day one of these banks is going to start fractional reserve banking with bitcoins and everybody in this sub will be angry.

Bank runs are rare, I guess it would fail if that were to happen. Or if it's a big international bank doing it, finance the losses from other parts of the bank, just like how they would deal with losses in other currencies. Getting bailed out is a pretty last resort option.
