We're currently looking at 100 min blocks (just over 14 blocks per day) if the signalling hash rate leaves and even longer if the price drops to the point that mining is unprofitable for those that stay. 
Basically massive hash rate drop combined with a large price drop is self reinforcing. Lower price reduces the hashrate, lower hashrate reduces the price, and the perfect recipe for ever increasing block times that may just never make it to a difficulty adjustment.

@_date: 2017-08-18 17:51:40
Okay but HYPOTHETICALLY, if SW2X completely takes over Bitcoin, there would be no damage to their customers/users. Since that is the goal, that is their mindset. 
No replay protection is basically a step in the direction of all-or-nothing. SW2X has no interest in being a stable minority alt coin.

Yeah, but I'm saying if you want to actually attack Bitcoin and it has a low hash power, you wouldn't block transaction, you would reorg transactions. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:58:04
That doesn't answer the original question 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:54:59
Yeah or use locktime on the faster chain as long as the block time difference is big enough but you still need to get a transaction into both chains during the difference  to guarantee no replay.

@_date: 2017-08-17 08:11:19
1/10 transaction throughput and less security means you need more confirmations for anything valuable like exchange deposits to avoid double spending from a reorg attack. Expect 2 days for the 30 confirmations necessary to trust a transaction and high fees to move money anywhere securely. That's assuming a random miner interested in increasing the value of SW2X doesn't just selfish mine empty blocks all day on the legacy chain, in which case there will be zero transaction throughput.
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:37:52
Via a hard fork? With a rollout window of less than a year? That kind of defeats the point of the legacy chain. It's biggest advantage is that they get the apathetic users who do nothing by default because they didn't change anything. 
If given the choice to upgrade to new difficulty adjustment or new block size I think most people would pick new block size.
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:00:53
93:7 hash rate ratio doesn't take much to 51% attack the small guy. It would be a 1 min slow down per block. And they will actually get to a difficulty adjustment in a few weeks whereas legacy chain is looking at several months assuming it doesn't lose any value. Years if the hash rate drops significantly.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:59:03
Basically everyone's answer is that the miners won't do what they say they will. Nobody has addressed the OPs question.
What really matters is whether BTC can keep its value with 100 min block times. If it can then great, it will be a shitty month or two to get to a difficulty drop. But if the price drops then the profitability drops and without any hope for a difficulty adjustment within a month it has the potential to cascade into even lower hashrate.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:07:44
Does anyone have any idea what the tax treatment for BCC cost basis would be?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:44:59
Unreliable? yes, dangerous? not as long as you control both ends of the transaction. 
If the hash rate goes the way it's predicted and SW2X has double the throughput there should be a pretty huge fee difference. If users stay with Bitcoin and post relatively few transactions to SW2X that difference will be even greater.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:21:47
Sounds pretty snarky to me. But hey there's no law against being snarky and calling other people put on it at the same time.

A hardfork rolled out with only a few months deployment window? That sounds awfully risky and kind of defeats the purpose of refusing to hard fork in the first place.

You need a transaction fee that is high enough it will get included in BTC2 but not high enough to get into BTC1 chain. After that you can move the same coins on BTC1 chain with a higher transaction fee and they will be split forever. 
If the transaction fees of both chains is similar, it would be very hard to do, but hopefully the 2X block size and hash rate drop will make a sizeable fee gap.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:19:30
Another method to split coins would be to mix the inputs with a post-fork coin base transaction. It's possible that miners on either chain could offer this as a service. Basically you send them mixed coins and they send you back an equivalent value from a coin base input on the chain you want. Those users could then offer the same mixing service to other people. If a transaction can show ties to a post-fork coinbase it's guaranteed replay proof.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:30:58
Because you want physical cash you can hand people and credit cards that you can swipe and thousands of small value transactions every second.

He made a baseless claim that there wasn't support here. I don't like being spoken for by loudmouth fanatics.
I support it because it had hash rate support and it is the most likely successful branch. I'm not an idealogue or an absolutist. Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum. It only works because people agree to use it. So I am happy to go where the people go. 
It's pretty obvious that a 90% hash rate drop will kill the old chain and a 2X transaction limit will not do any serious damage to the new chain.

The only situation that ends well for SW1X is if a significant chunk of miners back down. If miners do what they say they'll do and Core does what it says it will do, then the legacy chain gets demolished. A small fraction of the NYA mining power can just sit on the legacy chain and selfish mine empty blocks. At that point it's just a question of whether everyone moves to SW2X or just leaves because there will be no more transactions happening on the legacy chain
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:19:12
It's currently signalling at 93%, look at Kraken, they want 20 confirmations on BCH because they know how easy it is to reorg a minority chain. 20 confirmations at 100 min blocks is about one and a half days. The miners that stay with BTC need to wait over a week to move mining rewards on top of that if they want to sell to cover electricity or rent.

I think it's unlikely that the mempools will be kept separate. Anyone in the world can relay transactions across both chains and it really only takes one person to mix the two mempools.
So with that in mind, splitting coins will require a RBF tx with a fee just right so that it will confirm on SW2X but not BTC. After confirming on SW2X the same input can be replaced on BTC chain with a higher fee. Or if you want to assume that fee will never confirm (say it's 0 fee) it could just be left to languish.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:47:52
It will be trivially easy to replay transactions on the chain with lower fees. Easy enough that I would just assume it will happen by default.  Replaying to the higher fee chain is still possible but less likely. Once the coins are split (two irreconcilable transactions confirmed deep on separate chains, then there is basically no more risk of a replay in either direction.

Replay attack isn't really a network attack or anything. If you don't care what happens on other chains you can ignore it completely. 
Basically any transaction is still valid on BTC and SW2X even though they will have different non-compatible blockchains. What this means is that if you have coins before the fork and you send them to someone on the BTC network. It's very likely that transaction will show up on SW2X as well and those coins will also move on the SW2X network even if you didn't want them to. 
It's less likely for transactions to replay the other way though because the fees on a SW2X transaction probably won't make it into the BTC chain. SW2X has double the transaction space and will probably have more hash power (faster blocks). 
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:14:28
10X slower blocks means slower confirmations AND fewer transactions per day. It sounds pretty fatal to me. Any major price drop makes it unprofitable for the remaining miners, which can lead to even less hashrate. Add on that exchanges/merchants would likely want to increase their confirmation limit to reduce exposure to reorg attacks on the low hash rate and the whole system seems a lot less useful. 
I think that the miners won't be wasting any money because the money will all happily follow them. And even if they are losing money, they can get difficulty drops in a reasonable amount of time whereas the original chain won't.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:49:43
I thought avoiding a hard fork was the whole reason for the split in the first place. And in particular avoiding hasty short timeline hard forks.

Node consensus doesn't matter when each block take 2 hours and any large miner can reorganize the chain at will. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:57:26
As long as they are eventually successful, it's only deferred money not lost money.
I see no way for Bitcoin to hold its same value with 100 min blocks and a major split which means Bitcoin will become unprofitable and stay that way for a long long long time until the difficulty adjusts due to charity mining.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:02:08
Why are they obligated to implement replay protection? It seems to me that if you seriously want your fork to be Bitcoin, replay protection is the last thing you'd want.

You need a log scale in the y axis to make this kind of extrapolation 
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:22:12
Storing value is chain agnostic. You can just leave them there and they're on both chains. To some extent transactions are also chain agnostic.
To split coins you're going to need to split the difference in transaction fees between the two chains to make sure it gets into SW2X and not legacy. And it's only once the coins are split that people can choose wether to recognize them as one coin or the other.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:29:19
If you want to be THE default Bitcoin why would you implement replay protection? BCH realized that they were always going to be a minority so they did it to protect themselves. SW2X is gunning to be the majority chain. Basically no replay makes a
minority chain more likely to fail.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:13:49
They won't be losing any income if everyone values SW2X above SW1X. And I don't see SW1X holding much value with a 2 hour block time and less than 1/10th of the hashpower. It would basically destroy the blockchain security model since any largish miner could return to reorg the chain as they please in order to drive down the price of SW1X.

Splitting bitcoin from SW2X is going to be a lot harder than BCH. Basically you have to craft an RBF transaction with enough fees to get confirmed on SW2X chain but not enough to confirm on legacy chain. Then before that transaction gets picked up on the legacy chain you replace it with a higher fee transaction. If RBF didn't exist it would take waaay longer.
If you don't do this, your transactions can keep popping up on both chains.

What blockchain really needs to be useful is an agnostic proof of work protocol. Basically a way to say this data has this much proof of work on top of it without caring about what the data is or who is doing the work. So it needs to be compatible with Merkle tree structures so that everyone can pile their data hashes together.
Then any arbitrary block chain can start injecting hashes into Bitcoin transactions or other SHA256 coins to gain the immutability of a massive POW network without having to pay for all of that computing or worry about what specifically is going on in Bitcoin. All they need is the proof of work.

Time stamping existed long before blockchain. In fact Bitcoin's "timestamp server" (blockchain wasn't in the white paper) was taken from a 1991 timestamping scheme. 
Either way none of these work without a POW consensus. And you can't separate POW neatly from Bitcoin. The same way you can separate blockchain. So it seems like you are using blockchain technology to just mean Bitcoin technology.
