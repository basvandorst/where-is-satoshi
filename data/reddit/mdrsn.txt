if i remember correctly, this is something like Modern Monetary theory - which basically does just that.  Gov prints money directly to achieve full employment (i.e. fill the balloon to its max size).  but there are still worries how to keep that balloon from further expanding.  really doesnt solve the full problem ... still a shitty engine.

I understand if this kind of position is offered at Microsoft or Dell or any company that is large enough to have the corporate bureaucracy to deal with a low wage person providing the first line of defense against fraud ... (I actually believe that even Apple requires their lowest paid workers in U.S. to do a bit more than say 'yes' or 'no') ...
BUT Gox is not the kind of large corporation type - it occupies a small office space in a crowded Tokyo office, having (from what I read about 22 staff to verify thousands of people worldwide) .... I'd think that would want bright and best people for this job.  Not advertising for it creates a  shitty PR image (which is clear you care nothing about).
Perhaps we can change the situation - and imagine that you *just* found out about bitcoin, and want to get in on it ... and you scanned/photographed your information and sent it in.  And I, as a chu-hai-drinking-scumbag, thought that your scanner resolution or perhaps, 'pixelation' or maybe your scan in general - looked 'kind of funny' ... I flag your record for review, and move on.  no email ... no confirmation, ...  And here you are in the dark, wondering whether you were approved, not seeing your name move in the queue, no email, no response.  And I truly hope that you will raise a "what the fuck" with the customer support ... unless of course they have scumbags working in THAT department as well - and flag your issue as "in progress ... follow-up next week"  Oh well ...  
TL;DR: You have a reputation to uphold, don't hire scumbags.

yea, been seeing a lot of negative news about the coin lately ("the" being bitcoin, not lite coin ) 
although i do hear that it is coming to gox :)
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:31:15
heroes or no heroes, you can keep or close your account on Gox.  No one is stopping you.  Gox is not a hero nor is Coinlab.  BTC is a global currency, and the lawsuit between the two companies about "rights" or "customer" is a bunch of bullshit ... this is simply an example how technology empowers and revolutionizes conventional financial markets, yet two companies that have the biggest footprints in this shit, cant come together and agree on shit ... 
next point, where is btc-e on this?  I will have to consult the trollbox on this one.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:21:23
agreed.  Gox should have not signed the contract to being with.  However, it is hard to say what "exclusive access" is when it comes to BTC.  I can be registered on Gox from any country ... 
@_date: 2013-07-08 12:58:05
yes ... "please allow 1-2 business days for official communication ... unless BITCOIN"

hmmm ... you might be right ... I've also never seen anyone else use the "trillion dollar get out of jail" coin ... 
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:43:10
same thing happened to me - but it was completely my fault (leaving the api key in one of the config files that ended up in an early version of the web app on github).  their message was "thanks for the coffee" as the (small) amount of BTC was transferred and immediately mixed.
my question for coinbase: why cannot you do the same thing as BTC-E does - NO WITHDRAWALS ARE ALLOWED UNTIL CONFIRMED VIA EMAIL.  I think that is a pretty safe feature (assuming that your email password is never leaked out).
@_date: 2013-01-27 11:40:15

what you would have is pre-hashed transactions ... Mt. Gox does that as a redeem code - the coins are subtracted from your account as soon as you make a redeemable code.  Whether they are added instantly to someone claiming the transaction - I am not sure (maybe someone can test that?)   {I don't know enough about transaction types, but I believe it is called a "green" transaction, where it only counts 1 confirmation from a "trusted" source to fully verify your payment ... and 6+ confirmations will come later if they really need to verify} 
but what you would end up doing is pre-hashing from your phone the price you are willing to pay - then when it comes " time to do the "beep beep transfer your QR code dance" ... the only thing you would have to wait for would be the tax (or any difference between your pre-hashed amount and the real cost) ...
(since I live in Japan) you end up paying EXACTLY for what you are expecting ... where $1.05 means literally $1.05 and not $1.05 + tax ... [living in Japan, all you have to do is add everything you  bought without the sales tax since it is already included] ... in a restaurant - that would make sense since someone can wait for 10 minutes while your account clears (don't see that case for McDonalds though) ... but for a restaurant like McDondalds - if McWhatever costs $6.50 - expect to pre-hash 6.50 and not 6.50+tax ... otherwise ,.... please stand to the side while we wait to process your  transaction :)

Originally I thought they were somewhere else in Tokyo, but I noticed that they switched their bank from SMBC to Mizuho (Shibuya Branch, which is the same branch as mine) ... so I checked out their address where you can physically send documents to ... turned out it was very close ....

there are a lot of opinions on this thread ... you should call the bank
"IMO" or "IMHO" ... 
as in "in my opinion, i'm in control of my bank" ... 
i'm sure someone might come up with a more cooler name, like "international monetary organization" or something lame like that ...

hashcat anyone? if at all possible to port hashcat to a mining rig (or worse, a cloud of rigs) .. .bad things will happen
(note, i am not a linux pro, nor would i know how to write code to make hashcat compatible with an asic)
what asic / gpu rigs + hashcat look like to me  -  is having a cup of coffee on one side of the table, and sugar on the other.  then there will always be someone who says "its too far, you will never be able to have sugar in your coffee ... " then another someone comes along and brings the sugar to put in the coffee ... then the world changes ... :::sigh ... then we get a more expensive cup of coffee .. ahem ... sha 512 ...

TL;DR: (I'm going to put that on the top because) ::::sigh, reading this piece of news is very disappointing ... 
OK, lets get started,
Fuck you piece of shit Peter ... way to show that human greediness can prevail above all else.  Yes it is a service for customers ... yes I understand your purpose in 
It is my goal for CoinLab that we provide fundamental infrastructure to minimize these risks for everyone in our space, and I do mean everyone
(Source  May 2) 
Ok fine ... yes there are plenty of pitfalls as you explain it:
Bitcoiners have, on average, lost more money due to technology difficulties, frozen / lost banking relationships and shady characters like pirateat40 than due to any part of Bitcoin's fundamental economics. (Source  May 2nd)
This is not about America, Japan, or the rest of the world.  It is very simple in my opinion - there is a fundamental world-wide technology that emerges that gives everyone with a computer a chance to "claim their stake" on the internet, and for whatever reason, you think this is a reason to sue.  Yes there are plenty of shady characters on the internet (surprise???) but that is a choice that everyone will have to DEAL with because the nature of the decentralized BTC.   For a technology that has not fully reached the ears of professional accountants, investors, and the mindset of a lot of people in US (or Worldwide) you decide that it is up to no one else but YOU to play the "good guy" to protect the investors from "pirateat40" or other individuals.  OK, so what are you suing about .. .???
WHAT THE FUCK COULD POSSIBLY BE THERE FOR YOU????  Maybe investors are going to flock to you for some fuckin reason because you protected their investments?  (wait, BTC is decentralized you cant do that anyway).  If perateat40 is going to get a new username to fu/ck people over again?  you going to stop him/her?  probably not....  maybe mail your investors to not trade with shady individuals?
what else?  perhaps it is providing a "good" service to your clients ... OK ... fine... go ahead and provide the service to your clients ... in that respect, what is this lawsuit about?  USA?  Canada?  because you have the "rights" to usa and canada as outlined by some contract?
Anything else?  "exclusive" rights to trading in Canada and US ??? really?  Way to put labels on a global system.   Putting a label on a label-less phenomenon is EXACTLY THE REASON I'M STARING AT AN 11-MONTH LOW on the BTC prices.  In my opinion, it is like saying "anyone who wants to use a wheel in north america - register here" ... I think you bring shame to innovation and open-mindedness in general.
BTC is a world-wide phenomenon - there is no such thing as "usa" or "Canada" ... so even if you do win your lawsuit about the breach of contract ... I think it is a real shame that Gox entered in the contract with you in the first place. 
Yet again, I am sitting here, reading news about "new technology" CEOs (or whoever you fuckers are that hold high positions in you respective companies) bitching and squabbling among each other about who is right and who is wrong.  What is really nauseating is that how both of you divide up the "territories" ... like you are some sort of gang in East {insert name of your nearest biggest city here}
I truly hope that everyone in the world will accept bitcoin as method of payment (throw in litecoin as well in there) and as soon as everyone will value any good/service out there in terms of virtual currency, I truly hope that both of you can suck my dick!!!   (but only after the dollar standard is abandoned, until then, please do NOT suck my dick, and just know that I'm disappointed in your actions).  
TL;RDR; (too long Really didn't read) quit squabbling, stop suing for stupid shit, and try to provide BTC services as a worldwide phenomenon instead of dividing it by countries.
