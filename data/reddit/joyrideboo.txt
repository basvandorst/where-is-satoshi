Sell high Buy low.
the only way 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:03:50
Sadly I still doubt general population will get behind it. ( eventually tho more and more will cave in quick edit)
I work in a restaurant business and I literally hear customers engaging themselves in a small talk of bitcoin completely clueless about the technology and only seeing the monetary value of it. 
And when I ask them do you have any ? And how did you hear about it. And they all reply with no, they won't get it because CNBC told them it's volatility and that it will crash.

you are apart of something that's great.
im happy that you're happy 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:37:46
In the same boat as you.
My gut instinct is telling me to sell, the same one that told me to buy out of the blue at 9200$.
If it gets to 15, I'm definitely selling.
And then from then we see what happens.Nobody knows what CBOE/CME investments will do to the current state of the coin...
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:53:00
terrible idea.
if you been here long enough don't invest what you can't afford to lose...
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:59
OP don't forget... a few weeks back when BTC went up to 11 and then dropped to 9 some people actually panic sold their investment that they bought at 10.5k 
don't be too hard on yourself lil man! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:22:53
that's what i just said...You said you do know that Japan ...
and i quoted asian markets for the exact reasons.
reading comprehension is difficult when you're at 15k high 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:46:20

I was about to go off on you for buying a car with BTC because I saw the title and clicked the pic...
And then I just bursted out laughing when I read the entire thing. You are clever clever man! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:55:41
some people live paycheck to paycheck and have no way of even investing 200$ into bitcoin for any type of return.
You are living a life that is considered luxury for some.
People man..people
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:29:53
so much cringe...is this what turning into now?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:44:30
I suggest taking out profits and hiring a math tutor for your future sake. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:29:29
200k, give it away to @_date: 2017-12-07 09:10:43

@_date: 2017-12-07 08:50:48

@_date: 2017-12-07 08:37:09
dont do me like that boy, im trying to make a little buck. and buy back in;/
why you gotta make me stay 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:03:03
fuck coinbase is raking in some serious fucking cash...they don't give a shit if bitcoin rises or crashes anymore. They made a fucking fortune being the middle man. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:56:48
Can we start taking bids on OP's girlfriend?
1.57 BITCOIN starting bid.
I take 10% fee.
Do I have any takers? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:03:49
Got a dozen LTC or so. I diversified.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:39:35
I saw exact same comment at 10 k...when someone said it will hit 15k. 
BITCEPTION

"thats not money! get out !"
I love him so much. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:20:31
HOLD ON TO YOUR FUCKING BUTTS!
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:43:24
Bro you can't think about it in this negative way...You lose some you win some that's the mentality behind everything.
Ask yourself one question?
One day a major world event happens, THE ENTIRE INTERNET goes down and it's gone forever what do you have left? Your family, and your health and your will to strive for something better.
You knew exactly what you were getting yourself into and your story is going to be a great example and a lesson for everyone to carry on with caution. Do NOT beat yourself over it. If you need anyone to talk to reach out to any of us.
I will drive to you, talk some sense into your ass slap you up a little bit to get you to wake up to LIFE. This is a beautiful chance a loss is a loss but man moving on is way more glorifying !
WERE WITH YOU MAN. Do not leave this world behind for something so irrelevant 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:23:34
INSIDE TRADING!
15k PARTY ! WOOOOOOO! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:56:09

@_date: 2017-12-16 20:21:05
only selling just to buy backin again when it drops. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:15:02
hes going to dream FOMO 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:10:10
if people made money off bitcoin nobody will truly retire..they will go by simple formula of &gt;20% investment 
they will continue buying into bitcoin while living grand 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:59:22
Maybe a huge drop...maybe this is true value?
Ever since the huge public exposure of its value...A LOT and I mean alot of people have been investing into it.
you gotta realize one thing my boy, all logic goes aside when you're talking about CRYPTO market. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:30:52
from technical side can anyone explain how massive this actually is? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:05:58
when you read "bloodiest" in an article discussing investments, it's a good bet that it's a scare tactic for giants that have millions invested into this just so they can profit more by people dumping. 
HODL and just don't give a fuck.
you put in the amount that you're not scared to lose, so now they can fuck off.
Crypto will prevail, if not bitcoin something else.
they can fuck off with this clickbait bullshit articles. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:04:53
private keys you can import them into wallets. 
do not show that to anyone. good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:27:49
not yet...but were about to fuck it UP !
work in 5 hours !
but i wanted to stay up to witness 15k! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:44:00
Didn't know this. seconding this
fucking mental 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:46:14
People realizing that 19k buyins are still a fucking goldmine...
Guess were waiting until 50k is the next norm. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:03:15
how long does the wait time usually take to transfer from Exodus wallet to coinbase? I remember transfering from GDAX to my Exodus literally took 17 hours for first confirmation. SO i'm assuming it's the same process? by the time the confs go through it might drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:31:12
after going around and wasting my energy explaining about it, nobody seemed to care and just say "i have better things to put my money into. or ill check it out"
but thats about it, nice way of them telling you to frig off.
it's fine tho. it's fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:42:39
how do you have 5000$ but you don't know how to do basic steps in math?
I understand calculus issues, or even algebra some people struggle with...but basic 1st grade math. come on brovacho
what do you do? sell devils lettuce? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:00:02
trigger finger too slippery 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:58:43
I'm holding quite the amount, and I have no bills atm.
I just want to sell so I can buy back in again with the same amount when prices drop.  Just so I can have more of the bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:55:09
one rule we don't reveal how much you or i have in the currency. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:58:55
Pro tip if you want to live a longer healthier life stick far far away from Norwegian salmon. 
It's highly contaminated and mass produced in a really bad crammed environment for the fish if one gets sick they all get sick. 
Too many chemicals and pills pumped into them. 
But do continue to invest into Bitcoin by all means
@_date: 2019-03-17 23:03:41
You know it's comedic I never thought about it like that...I wonder how much money I actually did shoot to shit because of ATM fees and my bank not being near when I needed quick cash...
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:04:26
yep put 1500$ in today.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:46:00
is there any sensible reason to actually invest this low?
I don't have a single bitcoin, but even investing 500$ the bitcoin won't rise for me to make back my money unless it doubles in size...
anyone have a say in this? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:19:04
same with me went in on bitcoin at 9k, when the price fell.
7 days wait time for me with bankaccount.
i was stingy with the fees...its unreal amount. 
So i went with bankaccount 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:32
yes but bitcoin is already established, do you really think its going to continue increasing at such a rapid pace?
that's what my fuss is with it...I'm looking for sensible investment. 500$ is not going to give me anything over year/2years. 
i missed the big boom, even when the bitcoin was 1000$ that would be great time to invest into it..but now its at 11k  is there really a point?
for a minimal gain.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:18
What ever happens from this point happens.
Money is locked away and going for the long run.
If we make it, we make it.
But this is my first step into dipping my feet into the coin world. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:20:01
bought in today 1500$ @ 9995 
should I continue adding value if it drops lower? say to 8k? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:05
Honestly I continue this trend of saying no and no to bit currency but i'm going to take a wild leap and just do it.
I'm gonna do 750$ in bitcoin
500$ in Ethereum 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:37
that's what i mean. 
to see any major gains like say get my 500$ doubled the bitcoin itself would have to double...
Which is not that great of a investment for only 500$.... 
@_date: 2019-04-13 02:37:57
We just bought Mercedes with cellphone inside the car...
And we're about to be taken over by iPhones on Bluetooth ...
Rip Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:20:33
Should of given her that value in bitcoins and put the Bitcoin wallet address inside a cheap ring ..
Rings are so old fashioned and need to die off . Has no value and people spend so much money on wedding and ring it could be literally deposit for a house instead .
