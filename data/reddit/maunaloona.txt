That means the value of that asteroid (if we assume there's nothing on it but gold) is pretty much the current value of the 6B ounces of gold, or about 7.2 trillion dollars. 
Of course you probably wouldn't bring it all back as the more you mine the more the diminishing returns kick in and at some point it might be more expensive to ship the gold back than what it can be sold for. However, it's possible that point won't be reached until you've  brought back a hundred times the 6B ounces we own today.

Let's first be clear on what you advocate. And please correct me if my understanding of your position is in any way inaccurate. You believe that a group of people should have a monopoly on regulating what business owners can and can't put in the food they sell to the customers. To fund its operation the regulating monopoly extracts money from people in a geographical area over which the regulating monopoly claims ownership. If a person refuses to be robbed in such a way, the regulating monopoly fines that person further. If the person still refuses the regulating monopoly sends armed men to his house and throws him in a cage. If the person attempts to defend himself he is likely to be shot and killed. Virtually everyone knows that this will happen if they do not hand over their money, so few people resist. This is how the operation of the regulating monopoly is funded. If a business owner does not agree with the regulating monopoly's edicts and puts ingredients into food which the regulating monopoly disapproves of, the regulating monopoly fines the business owner and threatens to shut down the business. If the business owner does not comply the regulating monopoly sends armed men to throw the business owner in a cage. If the business owner attempts to defend himself he will be likely shot and killed.
Furthermore you believe that this is the ONLY way things can be done -- that a system of voluntary interaction cannot bring about a better outcome for the consumer.
The system that Stef advocates is one of voluntary interaction. If a business is known for misleading or fraudulent advertising or for poisoning their customers then customers are free not to buy goods from such a business. If people care about having information for making an informed decision about where they want to eat there will be agencies offering such a service. Such agencies would give ratings to other businesses based on complaints from customers, resolution of such complaints, secret shoppers, food testing, and inspection of the premises such as food preparatory areas. It goes without saying that a food business refusing an inspection would not be viewed positively by a customer. If a customer is harmed by bad food or fraudulent advertising of course he can seek restitution through courts. 


How well does your statist system address this scenario? What if it was a 90 year old crazy dude who wanted to kill himself so he sneaks poison into burgers while being employed by McDonald's?

Note that this only affects the *tracking* of transactions by making it look like a particular transaction hash does not exist, and inducing the sender to resend it (essentially making them send the payment twice). Again, this does not affect the integrity of the bitcoin network, it merely makes it more difficult to track transactions which you've issued especially when you're dealing with high volume of transactions such as Mt.Gox.

Sure. Check out [this video]( by Walter Block where he talks about free market environmentalism. 
As for food safety regulation, how well does the government do the job?  I used to work in the food industry and we would get an inspection maybe once every few years. We'd get ample warning ahead of time so we could resolve any non-compliance issues and be free to run the place however we wanted the rest of the time. And even if there were severe problems during the inspection the place would not be shut down. The inspectors would come back half a year later to make sure we corrected the problems.  The ratings given by such inspections carry no weight with me. On the other hand if I saw multiple yelp reviews which said the restaurant staff didn't wash their hands after visiting the restroom or touched customer food with their bare hands, I would definitely avoid such a place.

The way Gox has transaction tracking implemented right now is unreliable. This "bug" has been known for almost three years and yet Gox didn't have the competence to implement it correctly.

I think you're greatly oversimplifying the issue. Right now something really wonderful is happening to the world. Look at the last twenty years. We have technologies like the internet to communicate and spread our ideas faster than ever before. 3D printing, drones (for industrial use), self driving cars, bitcoin. Countless breakthroughs made across almost all fields of science. And that's merely the technological change. I would argue that cultural change is happening even faster. Parenting is undergoing a change with child abuse on the decline, resulting in healthier, happier and more intelligent kids. Violent crime down 60%. Third world nations are climbing out of poverty at an astounding rate. Religiosity has seen a bigger decrease than ever before in history. Taboos which long kept societies static are finally fading away. The common man is just starting to see the anti-rational memes of communism, feminism, cultural marxism and catastrophic global warming for the joke they are. Being constantly bombarded by new ideas people are becoming more rational and are starting to question the biggest taboo of all, which is the state. At this point the state is not only unnecessary, it is harmful to society. Just like slavery disappeared from most of the world in 19th century for economic reasons so will the state in the 21st. Unlike the french revolution it won't be a violent transition but will fade away with a whimper.

I don't think anyone is "blindly trusting them". People who are planning to buy the ASICs know their risks -- they're sending off their money to a somewhat anonymous company using an irreversible transaction. Couple that together with miners having zero resale value if bitcoin tanks are the two reasons I won't be ordering one.
Having said that, here's how I see things:
 - They don't want to deal with Paypal and I don't blame them. It causes too many headaches.
 - They're in a position to charge way more for the ASICs. It's very strange that they don't.
 - Possibly they're exaggerating the stats of their ASICs to produce exposure, hype and controversy. It's what happened with their FPGAs, whether intentional or not.
 - If they were to run away with the money, it would be inconsistent with how scammers operate. In vast majority of cases, either it's a full on scam, or the company is legit. This has to do with different skillsets required -- if the person has the skills to produce a good product like the butterfly labs FPGAs, they're likely to want to expand their operation instead of using it as a starting step for a bigger scam.
 - I don't understand why they're offering the trade-in option for the FPGAs. Either they want people to keep buying their FPGAs in the interim or their profit margins are huge, or they think they'll make more money from ASICs that way. Or a combination of all three.
To sum it up, it's more likely their claims are exaggerated than them being a scam.

While the 51% attacks is the most obvious, there are other probably easier ways of disrupting the bitcoin network by a dedicated attacker with a lot of resources. 
If you DDOS the major pools you might need only 5% hashing power instead of 50%. To pull off the 50% attack. Possible fix is if most miners have a chain of failover pools which ends in solitary mining if all pools are down.
Transaction spam seems like a good candidate for an attack. If a site like satoshidice can adversely affect the network, imagine what a dedicated attacker can do. I understand that transaction fees are there for this reason. You'd need to use higher transaction fees than the spammer for your transactions to get through.

ATI and nvidia have different strategies. ATI has more shaders while nvidia squeezes out gaming performance in other ways. That's reason 
Reason  is the ROT instruction. ATI hardware has it, which allows for significant speedups since Bitcoin mining relies heavily on it. Don't quote me on this, but I think it's something like 50% speed increase just from this.
Those two things add up to a speed increase by a factor of 2 or 3 when it comes to mining.

Unless a weakness in SHA 256 is discovered, it will be safe from ever being cracked by conventional computers through brute force.
Quantum computers are still a *very* long way from being viable. And even if we do get quantum computers, they're not magic. Some things they're not any better at than classical computers. I don't know if this applies to SHA 256.

At their core bitcoin clients implement the bitcoin protocol. Sending, receiving, and retransmitting. Any features on top of that do not affect the bitcoin network. It is not necessary to update your bitcoin client -- even the earlier versions are fully functional. The extra features are just gravy. (Though the recent versions fix some potential DoS exploits, so it's a good idea to upgrade). The official bitcoin client is open source, so if there's any 'corruption', it's all visible possibly including who committed those changes on Github. Gavin has bitcoin's best interests in mind and he's been doing a good job. If for some reason the official clients stops meeting the needs of users they can always switch to a third party client. 
51% attacks are interesting but would require considerable computing power. Current hash rate is 11 terahashes/s. My three 5850s give me about 1 gigahash/s, so you would need 16500 of such cards or the equivalent to get your 50%. Such setup would require 3 megawatts of power. I believe such a system would be more powerful than the most powerful supercomputers in the world. Such resources do exist, but they are expensive. Someone would need a pretty good reason to disrupt bitcoin in such a way. When you're dealing with such scales, it all comes down to money. Could they make money directly by disrupting the blockchain in such a way? Possibly. I don't know. More likely they would do it to protect their interests, such as if banks or governments felt threatened by bitcoin they might employ such methods to try to disrupt it. Until bitcoin gains a much wider audience, this is still a possibility.

Yep, it's risky. I'm assuming he waited until there were as few orders between the then current price and $9.5 to buy them all out. You definitely don't go into this kind of thing blindly and expect it to work. What if there was another big player who saw what you were trying to do and countered your orders? You might lose, big time.
Also, some say a third of maybe even half of all orders on Mt.Gox are bots. It's possible he saw a way of making money off those bots.

We had lots of deflation in the 1880s and 1890s and it was *great*. Prices everywhere were going down and the money people had could buy more and more. I don't know how you can say that deflation is "terrible for the economy". It's not. It might be bad for banks, but it's great for everyone else.

I can't see how they could be, at least if they're bitcoin-only. While all these bitcoin shops are going up, there is pretty good evidence that bitcoin economy isn't growing nearly as fast. I think the places where bitcoin will excel is where traditional currencies fail, such as micro transactions -- poker sites, gambling, in-game currency/item trading and illegal goods. These should be the primary areas of focus.

Let's say you're right and bitcoin enters a deflationary spiral. What will be the end point at which such a spiral stabilizes? 


Let's say I borrow 100 bitcoins and promise to pay back 110 a year from now. Why is that a problem? The lender is better off than hoarding the coins, assuming he is satisfied with the risk of loaning them to me. Both parties benefit because I get to use the bitcoins for a year and he gains 10 more bitcoins in a year.

The official bitcoin client is still being developed and new features are being added.
From what I understand, the bitcoin protocol has no such thing as an 'account'. It only deals with addresses. The bitcoin client combines a set of addresses and treats them as one account by summing their balances and using them seamlessly for outgoing transactions.
There would be some utility in being able to switch between accounts, but, I'm guessing, there has been too little demand for it so far for it to make it into the official client.

Very good point about it becoming the new government. I was actually thinking something along these lines except in a more optimistic direction. I'm almost certain the existing government will fail to protect people from such protection rackets. People will start pooling together money to defend themselves from the protection racket. This will not be cheap, and as a parallel private defense structure emerges, the government one withers as it's proven to be ineffective. Eventually the government will shrink altogether and a free society would emerge. I know that last statement is a huge jump which is hard to justify, but I want to believe that a free society can come about, and that cryptography and bitcoin will be the catalyst to make it happen.

Exchanges are not part of the bitcoin network. They operate independently of one another and the network. All they do is pair up buyers and sellers together. If one exchange has a rest period, the other exchanges would be happy to take on the load. And anyway, people can trade bitcoins for money at any time regardless of what the exchanges are doing.

Funny, I was just thinking the opposite. Is the whole bitcoin economy really worth 60 million USD? Where's the support for it? Other than Silk Road and the exchanges, I don't see bitcoin used to any significant degree. Sure, there are shops that accept bitcoins, but the volume is low. This is an unpopular opinion here, but I don't see why bitcoin can't go from $6 to $0.6 or lower.

I'm not sure how you can talk about fundamentals when such a large part of bitcoin is speculation.

A huge theft would attract attention no matter where it's sent. Later it could then be laundered, for example, through satoshidice or any of the other mixing services. If the thief has the technical know-how to automatically send wallet contents to their bitcoin address, they will do it.

Let's say there's a mining pool which pays double per share than anyone else. How long until such a pool has more than 50% of miners? A month? Half a year? I'm sure some people won't participate because they will see that the pool is up to no good, but pretty much everyone else will switch. At 50% network hashrate it would cost $700,000 per month to run this pool. Once they have 50% of miners + a safe margin, they can do anything they want with the network.

Yep, risks will remain as long as there is a meatspace component, although some risks can be eliminated with cryptography and bitcoin. 
Take a company specializing in assassinations, for example. One person, let's say the owner, would manage the online site, would negotiate with customers, hire hitmen, and give them jobs. The customer, the owner, and the assassins are just some addresses on the onion network (or equivalent).
The communication and payment can be made secure, at least theoretically. Out of the three (assassins, owner and customer), the owner is actually the safest and completely safe. 
The customer leaks information by providing a target. If for whatever reason he wants to assassinate his business rival or his neighbor, suspicion might fall on him. Still, the customer remains anonymous as long as his bitcoins cannot be linked to him. The customer also minimizes his risk by making sure the assassination company has a good reputation.
The hitmen take the biggest risk. Both their employer and the customer can set them up. They can minimize their risk of a bad employer by only working for those with a good online reputation. But I doubt much can be done to eliminate the risk of a bad customer, leading the assassin into an FBI sting. Good assassins will take the utmost precautions to protect themselves from harm. They might observe their target for weeks before making their move. Bad ones will get caught while good ones will get better with experience.

I think it encourages users to spam creation of addresses until they get the firstbits they want. If someone knows better why, then I'm all ears.

It's likely the computer was part of a botnet, sold, then had a miner installed by the buyer.
If they were incompetent you might find their login and password in the mining script. You could go in and redirect their mining to you, or shut it down. Very unlikely though. Most likely they're mining on Eligius, which doesn't require a login or a password. If they're using Eligius I can report them and maybe shut them down, at least temporarily.

That last theft resulted from a combination of things, none of which should have been allowed to happen:
 - Using API key as the password elsewhere
 - Not changing LastPass password after the hack
 - Not using two factor authentication for withdrawal from Mt. Gox
 - Continuing to store a large amount of bitcoins at Mt. Gox after Bitcoinca went offline. They should have been in cold storage.
As a casual bitcoin user, this seems unacceptable.

It will be a long time before that happens. The number of bitcoins approaches ~21mil asymptotically. It will not reach the max in your lifetime.

blockchain.info has ip addresses of nodes which relayed transactions. An attacker could harvest those ips, thousands of them, then try a slew of common attacks on each one. There are tools to automate this. Even if the success rate is 1 in 1000, he could steal dozens or hundreds of wallets. I see my IP in the database a dozen or so times already. I keep my system up to date, but who knows what kind of unpatched attacks are out there.

You wouldn't need to wait for difficulty to drop. Here's the scenario I was imagining:
DDOS all the major pool to take out a large chunk of the competition.
Now you need significantly less power for the 51% attack.  
Since you're the 51%, you can do all sorts of voodoo with the blockchain.  Your blockchain will be accepted as the main one by bitcoin clients. Note that you're producing blocks much slower than 6 per hour that you'd normally get.
There might be a caveat though -- once you stop DDOSing or the targets find a way to work around the DDOS, they might go back and fix the blockchain, invalidating the blockchain the attacker built.

Scalability problems are already starting to show. According to some, SatoshiDice is polluting the blockchain by 'spamming' transactions. It increases the total block chain size, increases the size of each block (leading to slower block propagation), and increases the number of orphaned blocks. Some estimates put SatoshiDice transactions at something like 10-20% of the whole blockchain. And that's just one site. What's to stop ten or a hundred more of those sites from popping up in the future? Where will bitcoin be then? These issues need to be addressed, and fast.

He just bought a bunch of bitcoins, moving the price up. When people see the price going up, they put up buy orders. Once pirate sees enough buy orders on the market to make him money, he sells, bringing the market price to original levels.

By that logic spending your bitcoins on anything will make the bitcoin price go down. I think that's too simplistic of a view. Built into that price is a valuation of how bitcoin will perform in the long term, that is, the chance of it going mainstream. And a bigger bitcoin economy will drive that valuation up.

Very interesting. So assuming all the math is solid (which is still being worked on), the current engineering barrier to such a *quantum* money scheme is keeping the qbits from decohering.
Also, if I understand correctly, the whole thing relies on keeping some information, such as the subspaces A and A^T private. If someone were to get this information either through force, a security breach or social engineering, the whole thing falls apart. Such a central point of failure is very unsettling even if such quantum money becomes possible.

I hear it costs around $300 for a 10k botnet. Assuming only CPU mining at 5 MH/s per box, that's 50 GH/s. That's 167 MHash/$, about ten times cheaper than video card mining plus to electricity costs. Even if the uptime on those systems isn't 100%, it's still a great deal. How long would it take to make back that $300? Days? Less than a week for sure. Even when ASIC miners show up, botnet mining will still be competitive.
Also that 5 MH/s/computer estimate might be too low because some computers have video cards.

It's fairly simple to model the exponential increase in total network hashing power, the difficulty comes in getting the parameters right. This is a simple geometric progression and has a closed form solution. 
C = Power costs per day. In other words, (Watts/1000)x(Cost per KWh)x24.
B = How much the rig earns per day. (The units can be dollars or bitcoins or whatever else you want, as long as both B and C have the same units)
P = How many days it takes for the difficulty to go up. Anyone know exactly how this is determined?
R = Difficulty multiplier for each difficulty increase. If difficulty goes up 50%, this will be 1.5.
How much money can we expect to make after N days if the above variables remain constant?
    Profit(N) = P*B*(1 - 1/R^(N/P))/(1 - 1/R) - C*N
If you differentiate that with respect to N and set it equal to 0 you can find the exact break-even point.

What allows you to spend a bitcoin is its private key, a 256 bit number looking something like this:
There's also the public key, which is the address derived from the private key where bitcoins could be sent.
How it works is this: Bitcoin software generates a private key and from that it calculates the public key. That's your receiving address. Then you give that address to someone and they send bitcoins to it. Now only the person who has the private key can redeem them (that's you).
If you wanted to backup all your bitcoins you could send them all to one address and then memorize or write down your private key.
We can go a step farther and create a passphrase under which your bitcoins would be stored. Could be something which is easy to remember for you but no one else would know. Hash that string with SHA-256 and use the output as a private key. Generate your public key from that and send all your bitcoins there. Now you can access those bitcoins using the passphrase or if you were to share it with someone they would gain access to those bitcoins too.

If I ever had enough bitcoins to worry about having them stolen or having to backup wallet.dat the following setup would be ideal:
* Have two wallets. Think of one as a checking account the other one as a savings account. 
* The 'checking' wallets would only have as much BTC as you need daily or enough to last several days.
* If you earn more bitcoins than you sell, you could send BTC to your savings account as often as you like.
* To use the 'savings' wallet you'd have a USB flash drive with a linux distro that you would boot from. Maybe one of those security oriented distros. Obviously everything would be encrypted so even if someone got a hold of it they couldn't steal your bitcoins.  From there you'd have a way to easily encrypt and backup wallet.dat to several places on the internet as well as local media, update backups, etc, all with a simple script.
I think that's the way to go if you have a lot of bitcoins and want to protect them.

I think at this point it's too early to speculate as to who controls the funds. Mark's actions so far have been consistent with him having control of the funds. 
If the money was in the hands of hackers, and we're talking about *all* of Mt.Gox user accounts being cleaned out, Mark's recent actions would not make much sense.
Btw, I think him consolidating the funds on the 12th shows that that was when he first became aware of gaping security holes in his system and possibly moved the money away from Mt.Gox, leaving just enough to have the trading going.
Around that time he had numerous reports of users getting hacked, which he blamed on their weak passwords.

As far as exponential trends go, I can say one thing about them with complete certainty: They work until they don't.
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:46:28
First, required reading regarding recent developments: 
From what I can piece together (at least the most likely explanation) is that no account had 500k BTC. The attacker compromised a random account and edited a value in the database to give himself those bitcoins. Prior to this every BTC at MtGox was backed by an actual bitcoin. Now there's 500k more 'virtual' bitcoins that aren't backed by anything. 
If this is the case, undoing all those trades is the only sane option. Whether Kevin deserves to keep them doesn't even enter into it.
And if the trades weren't undone? Can you imagine what would happen when the trading re-opens? With an extra 500k BTC not backed by anything floating around in there (And I assume that's a sizeable chunk of all bitcoins at MtGox), there would be a rush to get BTC out of there. The last ones to try to get their bitcoins out would not be able to do so as there would be no bitcoins left to withdraw.
Again, this explanation is speculative based on my (rather incomplete) understanding of how MtGox works, and I welcome corrections if there's a flaw in my logic.

At current difficulty you can get 0.09 BTC/day on that card, which gets you $1.485/day @ $16.5/BTC. 
The max power draw of the card is 250 watts. At $0.1/KWH thats $0.6/day.
So your profit is at least $0.885/day. Probably more because your card won't be using all 250 watts. To get a more accurate estimate you need to measure the power draw while it's crunching.
OP's question is whether the possible decreased lifetime is worth that $0.885/day. It's not a bad question. If I had to guess I'd say that as long as you don't overvolt the card there isn't a significant decrease in the lifetime of solid state electronics, at least it shouldn't be reduced below its useful lifetime of 3-7 years. 
Having said that, the common failure point for video cards is their fans, but as long as you don't mind replacing/repairing and/or cleaning the fan you should be fine.

Right now the estimate is an increase of 13.8%. Even if the increase is 13.8% every 10 days, we're still talking about it being unprofitable to run pretty much any mining hardware in about 150 days.
In reality what will happen is most of the low end miners (and all nvidia miners) will drop off and will be replaced by more dedicated high end ati miners. The increase in difficulty will decrease with each jump, down to 10% then 5%. At what point it will stop growing is anyone's guess.
@_date: 2011-07-24 14:46:55
At this point the difficulty is going up very slowly and bitcoin price is holding steady. Good cards can pay for themselves in about 30-45 days and a system can pay for itself in maybe 3 months.

I really think that bitcoin has the potential to be even more stable than gold. Unlike gold, bitcoins have no use other than as a medium of exchange. Also unlike gold, we have a total cap on the number of bitcoins mined, and we also know the rate at which they're mined.
@_date: 2011-06-29 09:47:32


Seriously? Looks like a cookiecutter design with a stock photo.
As far as using them as a bank, since there's no FDIC insurance for bitcoins, the site would need to be around for at least a few years and have a good reputation for me to even consider using it. I'd rather encrypt my wallet.dat and store it in multiple locations. It's the bitcoin equivalent of storing cash in your mattress, but we don't have too many options at this point.
@_date: 2011-06-21 14:18:36
It's important to make a distinction here between 'real' bitcoins that are traded in the bitcoin pool and 'virtual' bitcoins that are used for transactions within an exchange. Without fractional reserve banking every 'virtual' bitcoin is backed by a 'real' one.
Suppose I own an exchange. I see bitcoins come in and out as they are sold and bought for cash, but my bitcoin pool never dips below 90%. I might say, well, those 90% of bitcoins are sitting there not being used at all. Let's say I make a special account and give it those bitcoins. But I don't move anything around, I just conjure up those 90% and add them to the pool of 'virtual' bitcoins. If I'm careful I can loan out those 90% that I just conjured up and earn interest on it -- there's nothing wrong with earning interest on bitcoins, it works just as with any other currency. In ancient times this was done with gold -- yes, fractional reserve banking using gold -- there was no FDIC and obviously you couldn't print gold, but it worked nevertheless.
So, now I loaned out 90% of my bitcoins, and they're real bitcoins taken out of my bitcoin pool, so I only have 10% left backing everything. That's not a problem as long as everyone doesn't try to withdraw more than those 10%, or if I have a way of getting the bitcoins I loaned back quickly enough.
And if not? Well, those are the risks inherent in fractiona reserve banking.

So far everyone said that very few bitcoins were actually withdrawn from MtGox (Although I think we only have the owner of MtGox's word to go on at this point, hmm..). But you claim the attacker managed to cash out. Do you have anything to base this on other than a hunch?

Even a 60 day escrow would not prevent all fraud. A reversal could happen much longer than 60 days from the date of the transaction. 
The bank account holder has 60 days from the day he receives his bank statement to dispute the charge. From that point the bank could request more information from the account holder and could extend the process another 60 days. 
Let's add it up:
* Up to 30 days to receive bank statement.
* 60 days to file a dispute.
* Potentially there's another 60 day extension.
So in theory a transaction could be reversed up to 150 days from when it was made.

Bitcoin is still in its infancy and volatility is to be expected and will decrease significantly in a few years as trading volume goes up and faith in the bitcoin system strengthens.
Events like those that happened at Mt.Gox are likely to happen again, and will only strengthen the faith in the bitcoin system as it remains largely unaffected. Give it a few years and the bitcoin system will prove that it has the potential to be the most stable currency in existence.
As bitcoins become more mainstream there will grow a demand for a place to store them safely and securely. Online bitcoin banks will form, offering a safe place to store them. Eventually storing thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins on your home computer will seem as crazy, if not more so, as storing them in cash in your mattress. 
How will these bitcoin banks be regulated and what laws should they follow to ensure the security of deposits? Will they do fractional reserve lending, like real banks, and thus expand the bitcoin money supply? How can we prevent the Mt.Gox fiasco and hold the banks accountable? These are all interesting questions.
Currently new bitcoins being mined increases the money supply causing inflationary forces. On the other hand new people are joining the bitcoin economy which causes deflationary forces, raising the value of each bitcoin. Within a year or two, possibly less, as the number of bitcoins reaches the 21 million cap, inflationary forces from bitcoin mining will become negligible. Deflationary forces, such as loss of bitcoins through hard drive crashes, will dominate.
Has there ever been a currency not subject to expansion of money supply or other inflationary forces? What impact will bitcoins have on global economy if they become widely used? What will it mean when I can send money to Nigeria just as easily (and essentially for free) as within the United States? How will huge corporations react when their business models become obsolete in light of the new bitcoin economy? Will they embrace bitcoin and develop new revenue models, or fight to have bitcoins outlawed?
All interesting questions, and I can't wait to to see the answers to them.

There is still something that doesn't add up. What he needs to do is to:

 2. Prove that the $54 million was spent on research that qualified for the tax refund
He needs to do this to stay out of prison. What he is trying to do is:
 - Prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto

It's an act of desperation. The tax man is after him for claiming a $54 million dollar tax rebate and the only out he sees is to proclaim himself Satoshi Nakamoto. It looks desperate because it is. If I was in his shoes I'd be doing anything I could to stay out of prison as well, no matter how small a chance it had of succeeding.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:32:16
He's probably hoping to scam money out of investors somehow by claiming he is Satoshi. He'll use the BBC and other news articles as "proof".

I agree completely. Even if he signs a message with the genesis block it wouldn't completely prove that he is Satoshi, **and he hasn't even done that.** There's nothing to discuss. He's a fraud.

And journalists are (at least in some sense) incentivized to NOT do their own verification of the claims. If they turn out to be false then they don't have a story, at least not a good one. "X claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto" is a juicy story. "X claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto but the evidence he presented isn't valid" isn't.

@_date: 2016-05-02 10:03:41
Yep. If Satoshi wanted to weigh in, he could've signed the message to remove any ambiguity about its source. He didn't, so the likely explanation is that it came from a hacked account (or maybe was spoofed somehow).

I'll just leave this here.

I've read The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch that pushes that idea. His only argument in support of the many worlds interpretation is that it's more aesthetically pleasing. Unless the explanation offers us new insights (new physics) I'll remain skeptical of any such explanations.

What sells me on the Nick Szabo theory isn't his knowledge of cryptography or computer science, but his wide range of interests in economics and politics. While there are others with equally impressive cryptography and computer science credentials, he stands out as the only one with libertarian views and interests that match Satoshi's.
For the same reason I dismissed Craig Wright as Satoshi. For me no other proof was needed that CW was a fake.

The blog post seems to have been crafted with plausible deniability in mind. He could later say that he never claimed the message was supposed to prove he is Satoshi -- he used it as an example!

@_date: 2016-05-04 04:29:08
There's no evidence this guy was anywhere near bitcoins in the early days. I find it amusing why anyone here believes a word he says. He probably bought or is trying to buy the private key to an early bitcoin block -- maybe from Hal Finney's widow.
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:48:35
You don't seem to understand the position he is in. He scammed the Australian government for $54 million dollars and now the ATO is on his heels. The UK is also looking into arresting him. The whole thing was a gambit that had little chance of working. 
It's hard for you, someone who probably has low time preference, to understand how someone like him thinks, who has high time preference.
@_date: 2016-05-03 04:28:47
Curious about what you mean by  In what way do you think Satoshi should have helped? I'm pretty sure Hal was pretty well off financially, so money would not have helped with his disease.

Satoshi has no been heard from since he disappeared in 2010. Any messages claiming to have come from him had little to no credibility.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:12:16
Using words such as "reasonable doubt" implies the source of that belief doesn't stem from a cryptographic verification but from some other source, such as a feeling or a gut instinct. Those can be very convincing!

I don't agree. I value the free exchange of information more highly than the possibility that someone gets wrongly accused. I value free speech highly.

@_date: 2016-05-04 10:43:49
Ah, then CW's intention all along was to unite the Bitcoin community by falsely claiming to be SN.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:41:25
Which is not the kind of proof I'm willing to accept.
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:18:01
He has to prove to ATO not only that the 54 million in R&amp;D investment was real but that it was actually spent on research. Convincing the ATF that he's Satoshi is not enough. I'm not quite sure what his endgame is. The whole thing smells of desperation.
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:19:00
My take is that both Matonis and Gavin were duped by Craig. No hacking involved.

Fast forward a few years when CW is on trial for tax fraud. The people in the jury won't be technical people -- they'll be everyday folks who might have heard of the "creator of bitcoin" from the magazines but not of the debunking of those claims. All it would take is one of the jury to be "bamboozled" by his friendly looks, previous media bias, or his plausible-sounding story about ATO having no understanding of bitcoin and he might walk away scott free.

The inflation rate due to mining will drop from about 8% to about 4% per year and everyone knows that it will happen and when.

Nothing outside of a formal system of logic can be proved with certainty and no one but a madman requires or expects that level of proof. *Evidence* is what matters and the bar for proof is different for each individual. So far all I've seen of CW and all the "evidence" he presented indicates that he is a con artist and a criminal. To convince me that he is SN the evidence he presents would have to be extraordinary to reconcile his actions and behavior belonging to the same person as Satoshi Nakamoto.
That is not to say that I would dismiss any evidence he presents. Quite the contrary. Movement of coins will give us more information than we currently have. Hypotheses would be advanced and tested for consistency with our understanding of reality and more questions asked.

Right. If such an attack ever came close to being even theoretically profitable then I would be very worried about the future of bitcoin. Decreasing block rewards, if not replaced by transaction fees, bring such an attack closer and closer to being profitable.
But destroying bitcoin itself has value to certain interests such as certain financial sectors or governments even if they don't manage to directly make a profit from the 51% attack. Two factors increase the probability of such an attack:
 - The growing popularity of bitcoin, thus being a bigger threat to their interests
 - Decreasing costs of such an attack through block reward halving.
One doesn't have to buy enough hardware to do 51% of total network hashing power -- there are several ways of reducing the hardware requirements (and costs) many fold:
 - DDOSing popular mining pools
 - Starting your own mining pool and paying out over-unity in mining rewards.
Of course these methods would be employed in combination with using your own mining hardware.

I don't think you have a clear understanding of either how bitcoin works, or how such a change can be implemented.
The change will only be made if there is support from the bitcoin community. That is, the devs will make sure that most people do want the protocol changes to be made prior to implementing them.
It will be announced months, if not years in advance. The announcement will look like: 
"Starting from block n we will be adding an extra m decimal places to bitcoin. Make sure to upgrade by then or your client will stay on the old blockchain."
It doesn't matter what changes are made to the bitcoin protocol as long as the majority of miners and nodes switch over. It could switch over to a whole new type of cryptocurrency. Even if the above change required "a whole new protocol", as you put it (which is not the case here), it can still be done.
I do not understand what you mean by "you need to be backwards compatible." By definition any change which causes a blockchain split is not backwards compatible.
Also, you do not need to get consensus from all the miners. Majority will suffice. It would be a good idea to get the vast majority to agree to such changes as you would not want the old block chain to stick around.

If BFL had half the network hashrate they could mine $63,000 worth of bitcoins per day.  Avoiding a potential 51% attack would be the perfect excuse for them to delay shipments of ASICs even more while they do extensive "burn-in tests" which collect them $63k per day.

Bitcoin is a novel combination of technologies which already existed: Public key cryptography and distributed computing. There's little reason why bitcoin couldn't have been conceived in 2004 or 1999. I think Satoshi was someone who was well familiar with cryptography who thought to himself, "Why is bitcoin not a thing yet?" and went on to make it. You know how when you have an idea and you think to yourself "what if..." and then you put it into practice and it works? This is how I see bitcoin being born.

@_date: 2013-03-07 20:07:09
Exactly. Those transactions will carry over until they are included in a block.
Eventually this implementation will run into problems. For example, if there are more transactions than can be included in a block. Some will carry over to the next block, but by the time the next block is generated, there are even more transactions left-over. This seems problematic as there is no way to either cancel a transaction or increase its fee. You'd have an increasing number of unconfirmed transactions floating around in the blockchain. I don't even know how unconfirmed transactions are stored. If you set the transaction fee too low, you would have to pay a miner to specifically include your transaction if you ever want it to go through.

Oh, no. Non-asics won't be profitable at all unless your power costs are free. And even if you get free power, your cards might depreciate faster than you can mine with them.
What I was wondering is how profitable it will be for ASIC miners, say, by August of this year. It's purely a function of the number of ASICs BFL and their competitors ship and keep for themselves to mine.
@_date: 2013-01-15 16:54:00


Of course it does. The price of the hardware needed to do a 51% attack is an upper bound on the security of the network. 


Difficulty scales linearly with the network hashrate. If difficulty goes down, so does the hashrate, which makes it cheaper to do a 51% attack, which makes the network less secure. 


If a single attacker buys enough hardware for a 51% attack the number of non-colluding participants is irrelevant.

Yep, this is another way the devs could alter the reference client or even the bitcoin protocol itself. It would make the transaction costs more visible and bitcoin will no longer be able to market itself as having "really low or no transaction fees". That's assuming the bitcoin developers still have control over the protocol -- if people don't like their changes they will use an alternative client. The blockchain will split and I'm not sure what will happen afterwards. Will both blockchains coexist independently, or will one of them die out as all the users migrate to the winning one?
The way bitcoin is currently set up is to hide the massive ($43,469/day) cost for keeping it secure. I just want people to be aware that it's costing people real money to keep the network secure -- it's not magically created out of thin air.

I'm not sure what you mean by "should". Without a government there won't be anyone to force their "shoulds" on others. 
Land exists in one of two states: Either it is owned by someone or it isn't. If it's owned by someone they will try to either maintain the value of their land or even seek to improve it. If it isn't owned and has value, such as resources on the land or the land itself, then it will be claimed. Soon enough all land with any value will belong to someone.

Hash rate is the effect, not the cause. What determines the network hash rate is a number of factors, the two main ones being the price of bitcoin and technological advancements in bitcoin mining.
In other words, if you see a doubling of bitcoin price, you will also see a similar effect on the network hashrate after a certain period of lag time. If you see a doubling in hash rate, a number of things could have caused it. In this case the increased hash rate is mainly caused by ASIC technology coming to the market.

Was going to submit it, but here it was already. Have an upvote. The more I think about it, the more Doug Casey's position makes sense. Here's what he said right before the first great bitcoin bubble:
Doug Casey on bitcoin (June 22nd, 2011):
“L: Do they have value in themselves?
Doug: There’s the rub; I don’t see that they do. Bitcoins are just an electronic abstraction. They can’t be used for anything else, nor are they made of something that can be used for anything else. They are like one of those knots in a string that disappear if you pull hard enough on the ends of the string. They are not backed by anything at all. Like government fiat currencies, they are a con game, functioning only as long as people have confidence in them, regardless of whether that confidence is well placed or not.
I’ve always said that the dollar is an “I owe you nothing,” and that the euro is a “Who owes you nothing.” With Bitcoins – which no individual can be held accountable for and which have no value in themselves – I’d have to say they are a “No one owes you anything.” It was inevitable, therefore, that the scheme would collapse… at least in its present form.
Their main value seems to have been as a speculative medium. Worse, actually, in that they are – or were – based on finding a “greater fool” to pass them on to, for something of value. The bubble in Bitcoins is, however, just one of many to come as people try to get out of paper currencies in the years to come. With the bubble that arose in tulip bulbs in 17th century Holland, you might at least have wound up with a flower. This time, people just got stung. The message is clear: Get used to bubbles, as governments print up more and more fiat money.
Bitcoin reminds me of the so-called “barter currencies” people tried to start in the U.S. some time ago, supposedly trading units of “barter.” People traded chits, where a barber might charge ten for a haircut, and a lawyer 100 for an hour of counsel. But they were just another paper currency, based on confidence. And, when you’re dealing with total strangers, confidence is hard to come by…”

Everything you claim is flat out wrong.
Let's assume bitcoin is as deflationary as you claim. In fact, it's so good that everyone starts using it. No one in their right mind would use a fiat currency instead of bitcoin because it would devalue too fast.
Now you have a whole economy running on bitcoin. All transactions, loans, etc are done in bitcoin. People pay goods for bitcoins and use bitcoins to buy other goods. 
What's more, because bitcoin deflates so fast (according to you), now all the other currencies are relatively worthless. Everyone who uses bitcoins can live like kings because the exchange rate is so favorable.

I'm not sure what you're trying to prove here. You would also get infinity as the answer if you apply your model. An increase from zero to a positive number is an increase of infinite %. There is no finite number that can be multiplied by zero to get a positive number.
You're saying that my math is wrong when my number simply means something different than yours. Mine divides the % increase by number of days while yours uses a daily compound.

The world of no privacy would be an interesting one as well. While online interactions can be secured cryptographically, and will be done so more and more in the future, meatspace interactions can offer no such protection. Imagine having access (for a fee) to a network of insect-size drones with video cameras, millions, if not billions of them all around the world. Imagine such drones covering every piece of the planet, with all the video being combined and stored as a 3d model of the earth, going back in time to when the system first went up. Need to catch a criminal or prove that the other person caused a car accident? No problem, simply pay the access fee. Suspect your wife of cheating? That's not a problem either. If by then a state exists then such a system will fall into its hands, creating a world worse than anything imagined in 1984.

You're saying you could make money by investing in other cryptocurrencies, but you altruistically don't for the greater good of Bitcoin. Uhuh.




Friend, I don't ignore it. I'm convinced that what you fear will come to pass. One day the great bitcoin exodus will begin as people migrate to another cryptocurrency, whether it's litecoin or something else. Now, this doesn't mean that bitcoin will lose its  spot, but when the migration happens its price will tank while the price of the other currency will rise. It will be a self-reinforcing loop. For this reason I see using bitcoin as a store of value a huge gamble.


Hardly. You're mistaking me for some leftie who is envious of other people's success. The early adopters had the foresight to invest in bitcoin early on. It was a gamble and it paid off. I could have bought bitcoin at $2 but I didn't. That was my choice. Right or wrong, it wasn't a risk I was willing to take at that time.


But you don't for altruistic reasons? I find that hard to believe. I think you're simply unwilling to take the risk.

Yet another thing I have to trust them on. Why is it that the only thing I hear from ripple is "trust us! trust us! trust us! trust us!"?


Oh, it's their XRP and they can do with it as they wish. Our concern is what they might do with it in the future. They could issue 10x or 100x the current XRP and inflate everyone else's XRP essentially to zero.

Simply put, the fees aren't mandatory.  You don't have to include a fee, and a bitcoin node does not have to relay your transaction, and a miner does not have to put your transaction into a block.
If bitcoin goes up in price making the default transaction fee too large, the devs will modify the client to decrease the minimum fee. This already happened at least once. Ultimately it's up to the people who run the nodes and the miners who determine which transaction fees are too small.

I think you will find it quite difficult to spend bitcoins without revealing your identity or at least potentially identifying information. Any physical good you order has to be shipped to a physical address.

If your bitcoins are dirty it becomes very difficult to spend them safely. It's much easier to launder the bitcoins first through a mixing service.

You can have two currencies, an in-game currency and a crypto currency with an in-game exchange.

Isn't every MMO pay to win in some sense (even though there's no winning condition)? For example, if I had enough money I could quit my job and play the game full time. I could pay others to level my character while I sleep. I could also buy in-game gold and items with real money.
Having an in-game exchange like I proposed above would legitimize it and make it available to all players. It would spread money from the people who have it to those who don't, making everyone better off. 
If you make it illegal, you restrict it to the black market. In the black market there's a higher chance of getting scammed. But now it's accessible to only some of the players and not everyone. That seems unfair to a lot of the people.
If you legitimize the exchange then money will flow from those who are willing to spend it on the game to those who have more time than money, such as kids, students, or those in third world countries. Those people can then spend that money on in-game items leading to a more equal opportunity for everyone.

When you make an investment you evaluate the risk vs reward. It's a *voluntary* exchange. You hand over your money in hope of getting more of it back.

Here is the mining process: The miner looks at transactions and picks the ones he wants to include in the next block. **The cost to the miner of including a transaction in a block is very small, although non-zero.** This is the key point that you don't seem to understand. Including transactions which have a fee is like accepting free money for the miner. The cost of finding the next block is a fixed cost, with random variation, based on the current difficulty. It is not affected by the number of transactions in the next block.  A rational miner will either mine and include all profit-making transactions or not mine at all if it's unprofitable to do so. 
The miners have very little say in what the transaction fees will be in the next block -- this is determined by two factors: The number of transactions made and the average fee per transaction. The miner's only choice is whether to accept the money or not.

What makes you think bitcoin users are not afraid? Have you looked at this subreddit? Any time an alternative cryptocurrency is even mentioned it gets downvoted into oblivion. This is fear and hate at its purest.
For example, here's my comment which is currently at +7|-10:


This is in response to bitcoin raising the default minimum output size from 1 Satoshi to 5340 Satoshis.  All I said is that if bitcoin isn't competitive with other cryptocurrencies then maybe it's time to switch.
You are, of course, correct. The single biggest threat to bitcoin is other cryptocurrencies. Personally I have no attachment to bitcoin. If Litecoin proves to be better I can use BTC-E.com to convert all my coins at a 0.2% fee. It's trivially easy.

There's one exception -- If mining when there are no transaction fees is unprofitable due to power costs.

One thing that would be prevalent in a free society is information, both its gathering and distributing (selling). For example, there would be companies which aggregate information and sell it to those who want it. Those companies would want to know if some corporation isn't paying their employees. Just like the credit score today, corporations could be rated on a similar scale on a wide variety of attributes. If a corporation gets a reputation for not paying its employees it will have trouble attracting workers, and will be forced to increase how much they pay in order to compensate for the risk of them not paying out. 
In the long run it would be more profitable to pay everyone on time. Acquiring a bad reputation would be costly, just like getting a loan with a bad credit score is very costly.
Of course there will also be courts and insurance companies as described by another poster in the thread.

Excellent question, but sadly downvoted.
The question you should be asking is "will transaction fees grow faster than block reward halvings in order to keep the network hashrate from falling?"
If network processing power gets too low it would allow an attacker to double spend with impunity. That would be the death of bitcoin.
Currently it costs about $2000 per hour to pay for our current level of mining. The payout will halve to $1000 per hour in four years -- split among all the miners, of course. Will the popularity of bitcoin rise enough to replace the lost $1000/hour? If not, then network hash rate will drop.
Currently all transaction fees are earning $16/hour -- that's split among all the miners.
How popular does bitcoin have to get in four years to replace that $1000/hour with transaction fees? Does anyone know the fee structure based on the number of transactions in each block?

It's possible they needed the capital from pre-orders to develop the ASICs. 
It is strange though. If it costs them, say, $500 to build and ship each ASIC and they are getting $1500 for them, and they shipped 300 ASICs, that's $300k in their pocket instantly.
However, if they used the ASICs for mining for themselves they would roughly match the network hash rate of 20 THash/sec. That means they would be getting, on average, every other block. They would make that $300K in 8 days, and that's not even counting the extra BTC they would get before the difficulty adjusts.

A voluntarily funded police force is possible, but the service wouldn't be provided by the government, it would be provided by a corporation, or most likely several competing corporations.

Because of bitcoin the demand (and thus the price) of such zero day exploits will go up, which means more people will be looking for them.




Credit cards numbers are sold for a few dollars each on the black market. That's a small fraction of what can be extracted from them. The act of extracting usable money out of credit cards and bank accounts is very costly.




That's exactly my point -- they will all be exploited to gain access to bitcoins, giving us a more secure internet in the long run.




I'm not sure of the point you are trying to make. We seem to be in agreement here. A smart hacker would exploit all of these addresses at once, making it a *very* visible event after which the bug will be fixed. In a sense these hackers are being paid to find bugs in cryptographic and security systems.




I'm not sure what you mean by this. Could you elaborate?

I tried it back when it was called Entropia Project 8-10 years ago. It really was fascinating, but it was obvious what the game was:
 - Like you said, the whole thing is like a giant casino. Every action has some costs, like equipment getting damaged or needing to buy supplies. It's designed to have a negative EV regardless of how efficient you are, how high your skills are or what equipment you have.
 - Therefore, unless there is a flaw in their design, you will lose money in the long term.
 - Therefore, the only way to make money is off of other players.
What this means is the more you play, the more money you lose, just like a real casino. As someone who likes making money this dynamic did not appeal to me at all. Due to game currency being ties to the dollar, the player market was highly competitive. If you're good you could make money, but
 - After a while trading will get repetitive and boring. And if repetitive is boring is your thing,
 - Get a minimum wage job which makes way more money

Correction: Transaction price will go up until it reaches market equilibrium. Even if it settles on transaction price above that of paypal, this cannot be uncompetitive with PayPal *because people would actually be paying it.*  I'm curious to see how much more people would pay in transaction fees for bitcoin than they would for paypal -- that would show just how uncompetitive paypal is.

The alternative, if you can call it that, is to leave the blocksize as is and let the market determine the transaction fees.

Miners will reject transactions which have no fee or too small a fee. Miners obviously can't profit from transactions which include no fee, but more importantly there is a certain cost to adding transactions into the block. If that cost is higher than the transaction fee, a miner who seeks to maximize his income will not include that transaction in a block. The reasoning of why including transactions into a block costs the miner money is too subtle to go into here. I'll call this the law of rational miner:
 A rational miner will reject all transactions below a certain profitability threshold of BTC/KB. 
Of course this doesn't stop things like the free relay network from existing, they are simply making less money than they could be.

What you say is true enough. The government is a tool used by the majority to impose its will on the minority using violence as the means to do it. Your examples of government outlawing or regulating gambling, homosexuality and drug use are good examples of imposition of such violence. All three of those things are not crimes by any reasonable definition of a crime -- there is no victim. Gambling and homosexuality are transactions or interactions between two consenting adults, and illegal drug use is illegal even as a solitary activity. 
That much is clear. What you failed to demonstrate, or failed to even make an argument, is that such imposition of "morals" by the majority on the minority through violence benefits society as a whole. 
I believe in peaceful coexistence through voluntary, mutually beneficial transactions. A world where we don't have to point guns at each other as a means of collecting taxes to get things done. A monopoly of force, that is, the government, has no place in such a world.

When all transaction space in a block is used up, your transaction does not get included. When the block size limit is reached and there are more transactions than can be included in each block, some transactions, such as ones made with zero fees, will either never confirm or will take an exceedingly long time to confirm.
This will trigger a transaction fee race. Due to limited number of transactions, the fee has to be sufficiently high so as to get the transaction included in a block, but not to high, so as to not overpay.
Once the fees are sufficiently high, alternative cryptocurrencies will look attractive as they do not have such transaction fees and pay for the security of the network with block rewards.
@_date: 2013-01-27 15:47:00
Some miners include all transactions in a block regardless of the fee. You have to wait for those miners to find a block and process your transaction.
As for how long it can be stuck in limbo, I have no idea. Indefinitely? I don't know -- maybe there's something in the protocol which prevents it from hanging around without being confirmed for too long.

CPU - unimportant. One of my mining machines is a Pentium 4. You probably never even heard of it.
HARD DRIVE - Not needed. Install windows on a 8 or 16 GB thumb drive and boot off of it.
POWER SUPPLY - High efficiency rating to save on power costs, and make sure it's big enough to have 20-30% power to spare as they tend to get inefficient when nearing 100%.
COOLING - Cards do a good enough job of cooling themselves. I have a few computers laying on their side with the cards sticking out. Never had a problem with cooling.
RAM - Enough RAM to boot windows.
MOTHERBOARD - You need one.
The general principle is you want to minimize the cost of the rig and the cost of running it (minimize power consumption).

If they are constantly changing what is and isn't an acceptable transaction, then you can't call bitcoin decentralized. They will keep having to tweak what they consider a "too small" transaction as bitcoin price changes. 
Wasn't the whole point of bitcoin was that no one controlled it? That it had a mechanism for dealing with spammy transactions? That it relied on the market to make it work?
If bitcoin can't deal with the problem in a decentralized way then maybe it's time to switch to a different cryptocurrency.

Upper limit of bitcoin network security depends solely on the amount of hardware dedicated to mining. Currently the cost of that hardware is 25BTC per 10 minutes, which is what the bitcoin network rewards. If an attacker is willing to spend more money to attack the network, there is nothing which can stop him. 25 BTC/10 minutes is peanuts even for some of the smallest countries.
The only way to ward off against this attack is to pay miners more. How do you pay miners more? If you leave the blocksize cap at 1MB, sooner or later we will run against that cap. People will be forced to pay more and more in transaction fees to use bitcoin. This will bring in more money to miners, giving us better network security.
Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum. If bitcoin fees ever become significant users will flock to other cryptocurrencies such as litecoin, which has small fees. 
There is no way out of this mess for bitcoin without forking the blockchain.

BFL is pretty clever. Even if they don't have a product and never did, they could refund all the purchases today and make a pretty penny.

So they have a way out. They can process all the refunds and blame some unnamed manufacturer in Taiwain for failing to deliver. They won't look like a scam, but like an unfortunate business venture which failed to break into the tough ASIC market.

If you think people holding bitcoins aren't the ones paying for the block rewards through inflation tax, then please explain who is.


A percentage of what? The $10.75 figure is pure arithmetic: Dividing the average block reward over the number of transactions. One interpretation of the number is the cost per transaction to maintain the current level of network security.


Miners will include transactions if it's profitable to include them. There is very little cost to the miner to include a transaction in a block. As such, miners will include transactions even with small fees. To reject them is to leave money to the next miner who will gladly pick them up.


1-2% is based on transaction fees currently collected by miners. It's about 0.5BTC per block, or 1/50th of the reward for finding a new block.


Then what determines the hashrate? According to you, if the reward per block was suddenly removed, miners would leave then new ones would come in and the hashrate would stay the same. Miners would be mining for free. This needs no response.


The way transaction fees are currently implemented does nothing of the sort. Please explain the mechanism by which you think such regulation would happen.

Wages are sticky because it's difficult to fire employees or pay them less due to government regulation. Minimum wage is also a large factor in wage stickiness.
But let's assume you're right about wage stickiness. If we go from no inflation to deflation we are likely to stickiness in wages. But what happens if the same rate of deflation continues? Deflation will be taken for granted and well understood by the average person. They'll know their paycheck gets them more and more each year even if it doesn't go up in nominal value. If inflation is high employers might even cut wages. It might even become an industry standard that wages are reduced by 5% each year.

It's not obvious, but each transaction processed by the miner carries a certain cost. The more transactions the miner includes in a block, the longer it takes for the block to propagate through the network, increasing the chances of an orphaned block (which means the miner gets nothing). 
Statistically there is a profitability threshold. If the transaction fee is less than the threshold a profit-seeking miner will not include it.

"same level of security" means $20 million worth of hardware.
The incentives are not there to mine at a loss. Even if it was to their benefit to secure the network at a significant cost to themselves, everyone would benefit from it, including their competitors. Since their competitors do not incur the mining cost, the ones doing the mining would not be able to compete.

I addressed that point at the end of my post. While ASICs will increase the hashrate/$ miners are willing to work for, a potential attacker will have access to the same hardware as the miners. The hashrate is not a good measure of security as it varies with the level of technology. A more invariant measure of security is the amount of money paid to the miners. A potential attacker would have to spend a comparable amount of money to compete.

Satoshi's foresight is admirable. He used a pseudonym from the start and went to great lengths to conceal his identity. Did he not spend his bitcoins because he thinks they will go up in price even more, or is it to protect his own identity?

Most people also don't know how to fix their car, their toilet or their teeth. That doesn't mean they go without a car, or without a toilet, or have rotting teeth. They hire professionals to do it for them. If there's demand for a service and people are willing to pay money for it, the market will provide the service.


I don't understand how you can think that. When the government provides a service it suffers from the problem of tragedy of the commons. It's in everyone's self-interest to exploit the common resource of service to its fullest without regard to cost to others or any sustainability considerations. If it's a resource, it quickly depletes as you've seen with ocean fish stocks. If it's a service, the price of the service goes up because its usage is not moderated by the cost to the individual. On the other hand if the individual incurs a cost based on usage, they tend to moderate its usage because they have a limited supply of money.

Some of us do not distinguish insider trading from any other kind of trading. That is, we don't consider it to be a bad thing. It's merely someone trading on information they have and others don't, which sends price signals to everyone else about an upcoming correction, and helps stabilize the price.
Having said that, I do not think bitcoin devs have any information which might be considered insider knowledge. Though as you point out, they do have the power to influence the price of bitcoins because of their status in the community and access to the warning system through the bitcoin client. It might seem unfair to you that they might profit from knowing what they're going to do before they do it, but there is no way around this. From what I understand bitcoin developers do not get paid -- they are volunteers. If bitcoin developers manage to make money from it, that's all the better as far as I'm concerned, as long as they do not abuse their position.

Here are the pros of mining for me:
 - Free heating. Really nice to come home to a warm place.
 - I use the 7950 for gaming. A card that pays for itself.
 - And, of course, money.
 - I used to run minecraft and l4d2 servers on my dedicated mining computers. Free as far as the power bill goes.
 - Maintenance. Had a fan stop working on one of them which I had to replace. Also sometimes cgminer stops working, but this is fairly rare.
 - Is it a fire hazard to have three computers running while away? What if the power supply blows?
 - Noise. Though I live on a busy street so it gets drowned out by the noise coming from outside.
 - It's a hassle having to upvolt again for gaming, and back down when mining. Also overclocking has to be done manually after reboot.
 - When/If ASICs come out I will not be profitable.
 - Heat, in the summer.
If you want to get into mining, buy a 7970. It's the most efficient as far as power consumption goes and downvolts well. And of course great for gaming.

Winny was simply an anonymous P2P sharing tool. Arresting him is like arresting Bram Cohen, the inventor of bittorrent.


Tor is used for that too, as well as encryption software such as PGP and GPG. Should we be arresting developers of all encryption software because they are "aiding and abetting" the distribution of child pornography?


"Could have been using"? For all I know you "could have been using" your computer to distribute child pornography, too. I think we should arrest you as well.


It doesn't matter if the inventor did anything wrong or broke any laws. They arrest him to "send a message" to discourage others from writing such software. Or they're simply lashing out to show the rest of the world that they're "tough on copyright infringement". Winny creator was cleared of all charges after **five years** of courts.

You conflate society with the government. They are two distinct entities with opposing interests.
I do agree with your latter point. If the government dislikes bitcoin, or I suppose it would be more accurate to say if any of the large entrenched interests dislike bitcoin, then government will act against it. It will pervert the interpretation of current laws to make it illegal, or it will make new laws. 
Kim Dotcom is a good example of "legality" not being a roadblock for the government.
Of course, even if the government (**a** government) makes bitcoin illegal, such an edict is likely to be ineffective.

Good stuff, professor. I never looked at it quite that way before. Not sure why you're getting downvoted so much.
Here's what Hal Finney wrote back in 2009:


becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the
total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all
the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.


time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million
to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim,
are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...

No, it can't.
