That’s a great salary but assuming you are in the US you may want to double check your Roth IRA contributions with an accountant. I believe unmarried folks making more than $135k are not legally allowed to use Roth IRAs but traditional IRAs are still fair game. 
I ran into the same problem and there are certain forms your brokerage can provide you to handle this type of thing.

So now we need a “To everyone rushing back into fiat, we welcome you back.”

Audi A8 has reached level 3 autonomy. Not even Tesla has done such a thing yet. Also there are plenty of cars with adaptive cruise control + auto steer in the Mercedes lineup. 
And that's not to hate on Tesla, I have one myself.

I remember when Chilly the Polar Bear dropped from $1800 to $180, people thought it was finally bottomed out and had a solid investment on their hands...

Yep, because the post I was responding to definitely mentioned the decentralized frictionless prowess of brick and mortar during times of war.

The ability to sell / transfer for goods is valuable. You're not spending now but you value the ability to spend later on to purchase goods, services, or currency. However, we currently have alternative spending options, which Bitcoin has not supplanted to any material degree.
Bitcoin currently has value in USD (although dwindling) because market participants clearly see opportunities to spend in the future.

There are certain undeniable similarities. How does a physical asset appreciate by 1000% percent within a year and then drop by 3000% two years later? How does a digital asset do the same? You can have both utility in conjunction with volatility.

The comparison really isn’t silly at all when you look at context of the original thread. Beanie babies had little to no change in utility while the price sky-rocketed and then crashed. 
Bitcoin’s utility as both a digital currency as well as a store of value has remained consistent while the price has gone up 1000% and then crashed to as low as 30% of its ATH. 
It’s pointless to talk about utility when an asset is that volatile.

It would be  in volatility.

No, a 401K is a retirement plan typically offered through an employer (or your own business if you're self-employed). Wages are sent into the fund BEFORE taxes are taken out of one's paycheck, thus MORE money to generate interest from. Annual contribution limits are $17.5K if I remember correctly. You're profits are taxed once you reach retirement age and start withdrawing (you take a loan out from your own 401K rather than a bank for certain things like home purchase).
A Roth IRA is funded with AFTER-tax dollars (money in your bank account, assuming you're not a drug lord, etc..) And the annual limit is $5K for most people, $6K if you're older and playing catchup I think. Either way, the main benefit of a Roth IRA over just opening a mutual fund is your gains are tax free if you withdraw at retirement.

But in most cases, aren't businesses just instantly transacting crypto to fiat directly using a third party processor? So what you spend in crypto is immediately being sold and thus, lowering the price.

Thanks, looks promising.

If the value of BTC is likely to be higher down the road, then again, why not just pay for the purchase using cash? By paying for BTC, then replacing your BTC with fiat money, you're most likely paying a premium to the retailer, and then paying an exchange or third party another premium for the conversion of fiat to BTC.
You're right that people somewhere down the line DO need to spend BTC for goods/services in order to grow the currency, but there's a bit of game theory involved how much the individual will sacrifice for the good of the collective.

Do you have any examples of sites like this? Most vendors charge a premium if you pay in BTC compared to Paypal/Credit.

More like paying people to keep up with the cost of automation.  Human labor’s value is going to continue to decline

Does the risk of miner centralization in China go away if hypothetically Jihan is 100% out of the picture?
The US currently only mines roughly less than 5% of all Bitcoins mined.  Isn't it always more cost efficient for a low cost of living country with cheap electricity to do the mining as opposed to guys in the US running rigs?
