It is. The point is you owe capital gains tax regardless.
As far as the IRS is concerned trading your bitcoin for goods is no different than trading your bitcoin for cash.

Except in 08 we had deflation, and have had unusually low inflation ever since.
Obviously there is always a chance of hyperinflation, but that chance is about as close to zero as possible.

Bitcoin investors are amateur investors. Nobody is doing fundamental analysis or pricing things in.
The halving will likely result in another pump when its closer, that's just how bitcoin works. Granted I suspect bitcoin will probably be much lower by the time that happens.
@_date: 2019-07-31 08:03:19
It really wouldnt.
Imagine taking out a loan of a million bitcoin 10 years ago to buy a home, and now your home is only worth 20 bitcoin.... but you still owe a million bitcoin to the bank.
When you have a rapidly deflating currency nobody spends/invests money, economic activity grinds to a halt.
@_date: 2019-07-31 08:37:52
The problem is one person's spending is another person's income. So when you stop spending, someone else stops earning. And you cant save money when you have no income.
The sole purpose of currency is to facilitate trade, people hoarding it is counterproductive.

A "solid foothold" is not a real thing. Its actually quite a bearish signal, means its setting up for a move lower. See the $6000 "solid foothold" in 2018 for reference.
That being said it does kinda look like its setting up a falling wedge which IS a bullish pattern. But that still means a pullback to mid to low 8k over the next 1-2 weeks before the breakout.

The problem is no sane investor is going to look at this current chart and the technical indicators, and see anything other than a bubble about to burst.
Its like the market wanted to go out of its way to prove it was a bubble right before futures launched, just in case there was any doubt.

I mean thats like 99.9% of people investing their first time. They find a growth story, read about it, convince themselves its a smart investment then ultimately decide to invest in it.
Alot of the "i knew it all along stuff" just sounds like nonsense to me. For instance, why exactly did you predict a bull market 3-5 years out? And if you were expecting 3-5 years before you would see a return on your investment... why didnt you invest your money  in something else that would produce a return in the interim? That seems like a thing, most knowledgeable investors would do. Afterall the stock market was in the midst of a raging bull market at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:25:04
I doubt people on this forum have enough bitcoin to move the market. Even if they did, people should sell if they want, its their money. Bitcoin has a $230 billion market cap, not sure why everyone here seems to treat it like some penny stock pump and dump.

Because in order to demonstrate something isnt luck, you have to demonstrate it is repeatable.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:25:10
Here is the problem though. I assume most of the early investing around bitcoin was based around its usefulness as a currency. However despite the scaling issues, and its future as a currency being highly questionable at this point... the price is still rising in a parabolic fashion.
Anyone who claims they predicted this outcome, I am VERY dubious of. Because to me, it seems quite unpredictable.
@_date: 2018-05-30 00:03:44
I mean the whole wicks thing is stupid. Nobody would trade off wicks.
But its not like building bots that can outperform humans is some simple task. It wasn't until last year that a computer program managed to outperform humans at the game Go.
Humans can be quite good at complex strategy and prediction.
EDIT: Maybe a better example would be driving, something human teenagers have been capable of for decades, but computers are just learning to do now. But I think if the process of developing self driving cars was as easy as hooking up a camera to a computer and downloading a drivers education book, we probably would have had them a long time ago. Im no AI expert but I think programming bots to do things humans can do is a little more complex than you make it seem.
Because if you just upload a chart pattern to a computer, sure you can program it to look for that EXACT pattern. But chart patterns never match EXACTLY. So now you have to program a computer that can think for itself and make judgements on whether or not the current pattern is similar enough to the uploaded pattern.... and that im pretty sure is really difficult to accomplish. After all im pretty sure this is the principle captchas are based on. You take a pattern, distort it a little bit, all of a sudden bots cant see it but humans still can.

The underlying cause that's bad for the rest of the world is the US dollar is collapsing. Its a global economy, the US is the largest trading partner for most of the world. If your largest trading partner can no longer afford your goods, that's really bad for business. Massive bankruptcies isn't an unforeseen consequence, its pretty much guaranteed. Plus a lot of US debt is owned by foreign countries.
I don't think a scenario exists where the US dollar collapses without being catastrophic for the global economy.

My angle is that I understand trading. You see the price move due to some whale activity and assume some nefarious conspiracy. I see someone that got a bad fill.
Most whales probably wish they could enter and exit positions without influencing price. Its a bug, not a feature.

Yes just buy an index fund, since you don't really seem to know what you are doing, probably not a good idea to start stock picking. You aren't buying shares, it would be prohibitively expensive to buy shares of every company in the S&amp;P. Basically you and a bunch of other people are pooling your money together and then the fund goes out and buys stocks on your behalf to make that possible.

When it comes to trading the size of your stack is actually a huge detriment. Every seller needs a buyer and vice versa to absorb their transaction. The bigger your position the harder it is to move in and out of trades. If I want to sell 10k worth of bitcoin at current prices I can do that instantly, if I want to sell 10 million worth at current prices, its much harder to find buyers and I will have to slowly unwind my position and hope the price doesnt keep dropping on me in the process.
When it comes to trading, less money is actually better.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:09:38
Probably because they know you have little to no investing experience but are exhibiting extreme confidence.
Thats the telltale sign of a crazy person.
Does your girlfriend know how to ride a dirt bike? If not, imagine she came up to you and insisted she could jump the grand canyon. You would probably think she is crazy, because her level of experience riding a dirt bike in no way justifies her level of confidence in riding a dirt bike.
Thats basically what you are doing except with investing. And frankly they are probably right.
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:36:18
Anybody could be selling. The top 10% of bitcoin holders are by nature going to be the people who do the most buying. Because if you are a top holder of bitcoin, and you decide to sell all your bitcoin... you are no longer a top holder of bitcoin.
Seems like a mostly useless stat, that will always skew positive. Would make a lot more sense if it went by overall account value instead of bitcoin holdings.
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:27:11
This pump is weird even by bitcoin standards. It's never safe to assume anything but probably even less so this time around.
I suspect people may be less willing to chase this rally given the unusual setup, but only time will tell.

Predicting that far into the future is probably worthless, but I think its pretty difficult to be enthusiastic about the current chart.
@_date: 2019-10-18 19:25:05
Because you are looking at the situation with the benefit of hindsight. If at the time your friend you went to college with was telling you to put all your money into some asset you have never heard of that had recently lost a significant portion of its value, and you knew he had absolutely zero investing experience.
You probably would have been quite skeptical of his advice, and rightly so.

Im confused, are major cryptocurrencies not functionally identical to bitcoin? What is it that bitcoin does that no other cryptocurrency can replicate?
And it does seem investors care about block weight, as the market clearly reacted to the fork being called off.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:45:24


Right but bitcoin in particular doesn't have any unique features does it? It can function as a currency or store of value, which seems like a baseline for all cryptocurrency. From a functional standpoint it does seem to be interchangeable with just about any other major crypto.
Other than the fact that bitcoin is currently benefitting from first mover advantage and name recognition. I don't see any reason some other cryptocurrency cant come along and take its market share.


Everything you described seems accurate but its also based on the technical particulars. In that bitcoin's technical development is prioritizing a small group of enthusiasts concerned with decentralization instead of mass market concerns of transaction fees and speed. (at least this is my understanding of the situation)
Ultimately investors are speculating on which cryptocurrency will  find mainstream success. Technical details are an important aspect of that.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:24:36
I mean I have a basic understanding of TA. Granted someone calling 5600 as a bottom ahead of time, makes me think they just got lucky. It was a strong support and certainly an area to watch. But I think most TA people were actually expecting it to goto around the 5100 range.. probably based on RSI.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:46:53
It is true and lots of people do make serious money trading based on technical analysis.
EDIT: Afterall, I assume you buy bitcoin because you predict the price will go up? And you are probably using historical data to make that prediction. Which is afterall just an extremely rudimentary form of technical analysis. If you truly believe price movements are completely random and in no way predictable, then you might as well put your money in a savings account where you are guaranteed a return as investing in bitcoin is no better than betting on a coin flip.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:16:57
Because they have concocted this little story they tell each other, where bitcoin is invulnerable, will be worth a million dollars a coin, and wallstreet and businesses are at their mercy. If you believe negative consequences dont exist, then there is no reason to consider them.

By reading the charts. Traders made a ton of money on BCH, those charts were clear as day the entire time. Right before the dump it went parabolic and slapped you across the face with an obvious sell signal. Was probably the easiest money most traders have ever made. Unfortunately GDAX doesnt let me trade it. Quite salty.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:25:55
Ive been watching bitcoin for a couple months now and I have no idea whats going on. I feel like this is all bot trading or something. A decent amount of volume, but nobody is using limit orders on gdax,  when normally there are a always a ton of limit orders because people don't want to pay exchange fees.
Market is hella weird right now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:51:17
Both BTC and BCH are consolidating. Trends could continue or reverse but there is no obvious indicator either way as far as I can tell.
Far too early to celebrate.

Yes, but people have to eat, so you have to spend money regardless. The question then becomes, do you want your spending money appreciating or depreciating when not in use?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:40
No, because you are only paying taxes on your profit, not the total amount and you are going to have to pay taxes on that income at some point. It may be a lower rate but it wont be 0%.

Ok, but what if demand for bitcoin goes down? Then you lose, no? 
In order for you to always win, demand for bitcoin would have to increase indefinitely. How do you know for a fact demand for bitcoin will increase indefinitely?

It doesn't work like that around here. 
Basically what ive gathered from this forum is that you should never sell because you cant predict the markets.

You should really not rely on this place for anything resembling rational decision making.

How would a deflationary currency help wealth inequality? If the people who have all the money just earn more money for doing nothing, that would logically make it worse. Whereas inflationary currency, they are forced to spend, loan it out and invest it if they want to maintain their wealth.
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:36:35
Well I mean not hodling is also what caused the price to go up. If nobody ever sold bitcoins, the price would never change. Ultimately the problem is a lack of buyers to bid the price up.
Also I'm not sure where you got that statistic about traders but it seems far fetched. Just doing some googling I pulled up a statistic that 40% of day traders quit within the first month. But that's way less than 99% and I would imagine most quit after a few bad trades rather than blowing up their account.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:02:22
Yes but who is wealthier. A poor person earning a paycheck in inflationary income. Or an unemployed person nobody will hire because the rich are unwilling to part with their deflating currency?
This is ultimately the problem, jobs and businesses require credit/investment. If you make credit/investment more difficult to obtain because money is deflationary. There will be a lot less jobs and businesses. It reduces the opportunity to earn money for people who do not already have it. Thus increasing wealth inequality.
I mean just look at bitcoin. Guy paid however many thousands bitcoin for a pizza. If he knew bitcoin would be worth what it is today would he have still bought that pizza? Probably not. And if enough people stop buying pizzas, then it no longer makes sense to pay employees to make pizzas.
The factor you don't seem to be considering is unemployment. A deflationary currency doesn't do you a lot of good if you have no income.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:02:26
See but nobody is born with currency. You have to convince someone who already has it to give it to you. If currency just appreciates in value. then people will be more reluctant to part with it. It rewards hoarding wealth. And if you reward hoarding wealth then the wealthy stand to benefit disproportionately as a result.

So you think investors who cant stomach a 5% dip in the stock market, are going to find safety in bitcoin? Are we talking about the same bitcoin thats currently crashing to earth's core, or is there another bitcoin I dont know about?
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:53:09
Glad someone's talking sense. Been extremely difficult to gauge the impact of this China news on the market, as the general consensus among crypto websites and forums is that its either fake news, no big deal or even good for crypto. Just buy more, get rich etc.
I sold my position because I'm new to crypto, not familiar with the market.. and figured it would be smarter to ride this out on the sidelines, since I couldn't formulate a realistic assessment of the situation with all the unbridled optimism in the crypto world. Turns out my weak hands did me a favor.
But I'm not new to investing overall, so I at least have general investing knowledge to help weed out the nonsense and minimize my losses. But I feel bad for people with no investing experience trying to make heads or tails of the crypto markets.
Like you said a lot of the chatter is oddly reminiscent of a pump and dump... but bitcoin is way too big to actually pump, so I don't really understand the point of it all.

Is that normal? I just assumed there was way too much volume to be just regular joes moving the price like that. Like there had to be alot of big money buying it up.

But I dont know enough about the market to know if exchanges even operate that way.

Interesting, only briefly looked into Elliot wave. How likely do you think the 5th wave below 3000 is? As I assume the likelihood is based off how well the previous waves fit the model.

You cant predict how low it will drop. That's the point. Don't try to catch the absolute bottom because you will get burned more times than not.
Wait until it stabilizes for a bit and starts trending upward. You may not get the absolute best price, but more often than not you will get a better price than trying to guess the bottom.

Yea but it just seems weird that there is a big sell of on worries that the chinese exchanges might be getting banned... then once those worries are confirmed all of a sudden the price surges. It seems... counterintuitive.
Thats why I was wondering if there was some sort of good news I didnt know about. Or some factor I wasnt considering, like maybe chinese exchanges started buying up coin to cover their impending withdrawals. Or maybe its just common for the price to shoot straight up for no specific reason? etc.
Im new to bitcoin, so im just trying to understand these markets. Was hoping someone whos been around the block could clear things up. I have a little investing experience in the stock market, and ive just never seen anything surge like that on bad news before.

Technically thats actually a bad sign, sentiment is a contrarian indicator. Markets tend to bottom once everyone has given up hope and all the weak hands have been shaken out.
@_date: 2019-09-25 03:11:06
But new investors have the weakest of all hands, the fact that new investors are buying this dip is bearish. The first time I bought bitcoin was on a dip and then sold for a loss because it just kept on dipping. When your friends panic sell, that will be your bullish signal.
Additionally bitcoin being an established brand also is not really bullish. The best time to invest in coke or microsoft, was before they were established brands.

I guess the question is why do you assume people arent proftting off day trading? If someone has been day trading for a living over a long time period, chances are they are beating the market or they wouldnt bother.
When you bring your car to the mechanic, do you assume hes losing money by fixing cars? Or do you assume the reason hes fixing cars for a living is because hes making money doing it?
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:57:15
Panic selling is a normal thing that occurs in markets. People freak out when they are losing money. Panic buying however is much more abnormal.
Usually its a short squeeze, where shorts are freaking out they are losing money. But this seems like one helluva short squeeze, especially considering its pretty difficult to short bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:04:45
Thats now how it works, alot of day trading strategies dont scale. Every seller needs a buyer and vice versa. For instance if you want to sell 10 bitcoin immediately, you probably can at or near current market value. However if you want to sell 1,000 bitcoin immediately, you will drive down the price of bitcoin in the process and errode or eliminate your profits from that trade.
Thats why day traders are usually joe schmoes not working with huge amounts of capital. You can make a good living day trading, but the larger the position size, the less effective it becomes.
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:33:48
Just going off GDAX order book. If you were to market sell 1000 bitcoin right now, it would plunge the price by $160... whereas if you market sold 10 bitcoin, it would drop the price by $6. Ergo, the smaller position would have a much higher average selling price than the larger position. Now lets say you are trying to scalp a $100 move. You probably walk away with about $994 if you were trading 10 bitcoin. Whereas if you were trading 1000 bitcoin the same trade would be a $60,000 loss. (EDIT: BTW this is assuming similar slippage on the buy, and that the average price of the trade is the median price, plus not taking into account trading fees etc. The point isnt to give an exact example but simply to demonstrate how larger position sizes errode profits, marketcap be damned.)
And day traders dont just make money on the upside, they also make money on the downside by shorting. Its arguably much easier to make money during a bear market as panic selling is alot quicker and more decisive.
And day traders typically manage a single position at a time. So if a hedge fund wanted to day trade 100 different securities to solve the scaling problem, they would have to hire 100 different day traders. And why would the day traders work for them in the first place? You would have to pay them less than they are currently making in order to turn a profit.
Im mainly an investor, but I use knowledge of trading to better manage my positions. The difference is I undertstand markets and trading, whereas you obviously dont. And yes there are plenty of successful day traders, just like there are plenty of successful doctors.. but I cant produce 10 years of a professional day traders tax return any easier than I can produce 10 years of a professional doctor's tax return. You obviously know this, and are making impossible requests because you realize you lack the knowledge to rebut the things im saying, yet for whatever reason despite this lack of knowledge, you are still confident in your opinion.

Well my parents grew up in a rich neighborhood, so they knew professional traders. My girlfriend's best friend's father also makes his living trading.
There are people on youtube like Ross from warrior trading that shows all his trades and he handedly beats the market. Hell the IRS has a special distinction and different rules for filing capital gains/losses specifically for professional traders.
Why do you assume these people dont exist? Simply because you dont know any? There are millions of different professions on the planet, for 99.9% of them I dont personally know anybody. Ive heard a tree surgeon is a thing, never met a tree surgeon, dont even know what they do. That doesnt mean there arent people making a living as tree surgeons though.
I mean just google professional day trader, im sure you can find a boatload of names.
