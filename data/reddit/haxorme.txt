I don't represent them but just wanted to share, looks like a very cool job!

very interesting so far sir.
a few recommendations:
Tell us what type of creep does what? Im assuming the destroyer is an air unit however it seems unbalanced that you would weak build air towers from the start of the game for a massively strong air unit later on.
I assume upgrades of towers are in progress?
Can you tell us about your security measures?
Otherwise, great idea. I have thought a few times about skill based btc wager games, and this is one that is pretty secure against any kind of botting, for now. example BTC chess.
