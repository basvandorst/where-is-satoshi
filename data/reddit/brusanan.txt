The use is that they get to turn themselves into a bank and use trendy buzzwords like "cryptocurrency" and "blockchain" to advertise their bank to people who don't really understand what those things are.

You're just describing more middleman platforms. All of those would cost money to develop and maintain. They will never be free, because no service can operate at a loss forever.

You're not out that money until you sell at a loss.
Which you will probably do, because you are clearly an idiot.

Last election is exactly how we can be sure. The DNC's nominee is chosen purely through nepotism, and they actively sabotage any candidate who might get in the way of that.

There is an interview with him about this, and he spends half of it just passive-aggressively talking about how he's going to tank bitcoins value by dumping $5 billion worth. The whole thing just comes off as an attempt to shake the public's faith in BTC. He's all talk.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:33:11
This is why anyone who insists BTC is for criminals is full of shit. When you use BTC for crime, it can always be traced back to you. Most criminals use cash, because it's the best way for a transaction to remain untraceable.
It's weird to me that they are calling this the largest child exploitation site takedown ever. It seems small compared to some of the other takedowns that have been reported over the last few years, in terms of number of arrests and children saved. Also, they don't mention the actual number of users, or how much money the site actually made.
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:45:05
No, it doesn't defeat the purpose of bitcoin. This is how bitcoin works, by design. Once you deanonymize a wallet you can trace every transaction the owner has ever made.
Essentially, if you want to commit crime using bitcoin, you are creating a paper trail that will never go away. So don't do that.

You did it wrong, OP. You're supposed to promise to eat your dick if it doesn't hit $50,000 by EOY.

That's the point. That's the main strength BTC has over fiat currencies.

Only people who don't know any better. What's the point in getting everything for free if everything you have sucks as a result of it?

OP, out of curiosity, how much did you originally spend on this BTC?

Upvoting so OP sees. That's a free $40k worth of some scam shitcoin that you can sell immediately.

How exactly is that different than fiat currency?
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:49:57
These guys seem to have a ton of shills giving them positive reviews on review sites. All of the reviews follow the same format, worded slightly differently, in broken English ([I am happy with this service][They have a "modern" interface][Their fees are very low][Don't trust those calling it a scam] etc.).
If you want to hurt them, run to those sites and warn off potential victims. Upvote other reviews calling them out, and downvote the shills.

Posting a Stonetoss comic is an invitation for a mob of SJWs to come in and declare their moral superiority.  
"Oh look, a random comic about Bitcoin, without any watermarkings. That is mildly amusing, and I can relate to it as a fan of Bitcoin."  
"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE DON'T YOU KNOW LAUGHING AT A JOKE THAT A NAZI MADE MAKES YOU A NAZI!?"  
EDIT: Edited because there weren't enough E's.
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:12:34
It's a random comic about Bitcoin, with no watermark. The only people here who know or care who Stonetoss is are the ones slithering in to bitch and moan about him.
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:01:38
It isn't?

Most of the people calling bitcoin worthless for being so "cheap" right now have less than the value of a single bitcoin in their bank account.

This isn't "people identifying who made a comic and expressing their distaste for the artist". This is a toxic mob of vote brigaders swooping in to shit up a subreddit that is in no way related to their political agenda. This is a bunch of people visiting r/Bitcoin for their very first time to make posts like "Oh, well I guess all supporters of Bitcoin are Nazis, now". And then tomorrow we will see a WSJ article with the same headline.
When you see a random funny image on the internet, you shouldn't be expected to track down its creator and analyze their political and ideological beliefs in order to decide if it's morally acceptable for you to laugh or not.
