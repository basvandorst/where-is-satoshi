Started  in 2014, today the first central bank licensed crypto exchange in the country. We almost shut down more than once, mostly because banks kept shutting us down once they discovered we were a bitcoin company. I was part of the technical working group that wrote the new regulations with the central bank, allowing us and others to legally exchange crypto today. 
Got an investment from Kakao Talk in 2016. 50 employees now and growing fast. Today, banks are tripping over themselves to work with us.
We dont have it hard now, nope, but it was definitely a struggle.

It is still the early days. Also, this isnt a get rich quick scheme, and your doubled "investment" could lose half or more of that value overnight. Like i said over and over again, the price of one BTC is not where its value comes from. Understand the technology, and you'll stop looking at the exchange rate :)

Will ot hold its value over time? As long as it keeps chugging every ten minutes, it just keeps adding to its value, so yes, it probably will. It does one thing and does it well, no more, no less :)

Bitcoin set out to do one thing and one thing alone: as a proposed solution to the double spending problem, using a peer to peer network.
Whatever the market decides to tack on to it as a "value proposition" has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It's open, free, nobody owns it, and purely voluntary.
99.999% uptime 10 years, still uncensorable transactions, still never been double spent even without a trusted third party. It's still doing what it set out to do. 
Let people decide what Bitcoin is for them. If you don't like it, dont use it. Nobody is ever forced to run the network. If it fails, and it could, that would be if everyone decides to stop running it.

It's a localbitcoins account, so sadly, you're right. All I have now is the transaction hash from transferring it out of there to my own wallet. 
I can't prove it for sure unless I move the funds again and sign the transaction but yeah, too much effort. You don't have to believe it and I don't need you to, but it is great that you are skeptical! 
If you check number of confirmations, it totally shows hat the time I posted this and the time I sent it out is almost the same ;)
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:13:36
Hey man, don't worry, that's normal. I went through the same thing after the 2013 crash. I had just started my bitcoin startup in the Philippines then, and we watched Bitcoin fall from $1200 down to $190 in a slow and painful bleedout from Jan 2014 to Jan 2015. By Jan 2016, Mike Hearn, one of the top core developers of Bitcoin who worked directly with Satoshi himself, went out in public and declared Bitcoin a failed experiment and said he sold all his Bitcoin. 
Right now Bitcoin is at $6000+ which is INSANE. But like Andreas says, the price of Bitcoin is the least interesting thing about it! Even us veterans never expected this, this soon. I've laid out a lot of my thoughts on Medium, if you're interested in reading more! 
Here's an article I wrote early this year:

And if it is not decentralized, it is worthless. They're better off sticking to the old school ways.  
If it **IS** decentralized and will rely on miners, all a mining pool with enough hashing power has to do is point their miners at this "new" blockchain worth trillions and go to town with it. 
The incentive to be honest gets thrown out the window.

Other than the growth of the online community from less than 500 to 3500 in a few months (not including many other groups such as cryptominers PH, Coinpal, Bitcoin Miners) merchant adoption has been promising as well. 
Over 120 merchants now accept bitcoin online, as well as several brick and mortar restaurants/coffee shops including a small but growing fast food chain. Online shopping site metrodeal and cashcashpinoy also accepting Bitcoin, plus one of the biggest clothing brands (BENCH) accept it for their online shop. 
Bitcoin startups are also growing in number, which is always a great sign. As far as I know today, there is our company [Satoshi Citadel Industries]( [Buybitcoin.ph]( [Coins.ph]( [mBTC.ph]( [Coinxchange]( Coinpay, and some upcoming ones that havent made any big splashes yet but are definitely ready to dive in.

Right now the only way to do that is to have a bank account connected to coinbase and do it directly from there (there is an option to log in via coinbase). So fiat in the bank buy btc with coinbase and then send to rebit and we switch it out to fiat again here into the hands of the recipient. This will probably work with Circle as well. 
To make it seem like it is fiat to fiat to the customer is our end goal, of course.

It is not YET better to use Bitcoin than cold hard cash or even most online transactions. Did you use the internet in the early 90s? It was clumsy, expensive, slow, and out of reach for most people. Bitcoin is in that stage right now. It IS in essence better in every way, but the technology needs to evolve some more. Wait for the new tech and apps that are coming out. It won't take more than a couple of years.
Just imagine if we could invent money for the first time today, in 2014, instead of hundreds of years BC, like we did historically, do you think we would still use metal coins and paper sheets?
A dollar in 1971 (the year they turned fiat and was no longer backed by gold) is now only worth 17 cents. 83% of the value gone in less than one generation. People have been ignorant about money for too long, and Bitcoin is changing this. 
But only time will really tell. In its essence though, it is far far superior to fiat currency.

Interesting that you brought up Filipino boat makers in the typhoon stricken area of Tacloban. My friend started a project that builds boats for the fishermen of Tacloban and has gotten over 300 boat donations that costs $115 each.

It is there *in the world bank website*. I don't see anything in Xoom or WU saying "we charge 2% off the exchange rate", what you see is "Pay only 4.99!". 
I get it, you refuse to understand. Rebit charges 1% to remit 1000 pesos internationally. This is not possible with ANY service in the world. Do you want to use 2GO as a local remittance option? If you do, we will do it for you for free. You pay THEM the 120.  Maybe 2GO should charge less. Too bad Rebit is 4 months old and does not have hundreds of remitrance centers to use. With the many, many transactions we have processed though, none so far have used 2GO. There are many other options. Why would you choose the worst one? To prove a stupid point maybe. So yes, if you choose that option, you pay that much. 
What if I do EXACTLY what you are doing and [choose the worst option]( using, say, Western Union US to PH,it says on the world bank website that the sender pays 14.62% on a $200 remittance.  There are worse ones but I used your favorite company.

hi! If you check out the site, there is a real time calculator of any fees you might incur in the process. For bank deposits it is usually zero, and the 1%rebit fee that is charged to the sender (the BTC you will need to send will be 1% more than the peso amount).
You can actually try the process out without actually committing to send anything, just to get a feel for it. Let me know if you have anymore questions!

It is an unfair comparison because I am talking about potential. The Philippines has a tiny bitcoin community first of all, amd most of the donations were local. 
I'm talking about a potential future where sending $1 or 1 mBTC from anywhere in the world is possible for millions of people, instantly and reliably, with smart bitcoin contracts that will automate the allocation of funds based on a predetermined algorithm and will be fully transparent for everyone to see where the money goes, down to the last bit. We're talking about raising millions in seconds, and transporting those funds to where they are needed instantly.

Collecting tips? Never asked for them, don't need them, will be donating everything. 
What's your obsession with Coinmap? Not all bitcoin accepting businesses are on Coinmap. What if I told you that *gasp* Coinmap is not that important to us over here? Don't get me wrong, we love Coinmap, but there are more important things to focus on that *getting on coinmap*... things like making sure our service is perfect. 
You can see their address if you just googled Wingman, Acacia Estates, &gt;Philippines.

I absolutely agree with you on this. Elegant is one of the best words I can think of to describe what Satoshi did. He practically solved the 35 year old "double spending problem" in computer science by making it more beneficial to help the network than to try to cheat it.
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:56:17
It's a great analogy. I just used it a while ago while explaining Bitcoin to a friend. It shows how the value of money is simply an agreement between two parties and not the actual piece of paper or metal coin (except maybe precious metal coins.)

We have a side by side comparison with Xoom on the site. Xoom charges a flat fee of $4.99 for transactions up to $2,999. What they don't tell you is that they have a 2.55% mark up on the USD to peso exchange rate. We did the math and up to a certain amount, Rebit.ph is definitely cheaper. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 19:12:11
Here's the [rate comparison](
We don't sell Bitcoin, we only buy it. We buy it at market rate (based on the spot price according to the best average rate at the time) and have a 1% fee. EDIT: and then we remit the fiat to the person in the Philippines nominated by the seller. You can argue about the spreads, but here's something we have been able to do with Rebit.ph that is IMPOSSIBLE with anything else:
We can take *international* remittances as low as P1000 ($22) and still only charge 1%. That's 22 cents. Try sending anything below $100 with western union and prepare to pay $10 plus a hit on the exchange rate.

Yeah and the $30 million that Bitpay got wasn't real? How about the rest of the VC money? The eBay CEO was lying when he said they were looking at Bitcoin closely? How about the thousands of people developing apps and infrastructure? 
Heck, me and my partners have spent and will be spending a whole lot of money for our 4 month old startup and its upcoming verticals in the next year or two all the way over here in the Philippines. A third world country!
When the Internet was 7 years old it had about three million users worldwide. Bitcoin has about 2 million right now. In 2-3 years, one of us will be right. Today, there is insufficient data for a meaningful answer, but we can use the data we have now to extrapolate what we think could happen.

You know how much dogecoin I got? **ZERO**. Not a single dogecoiner came to say hi. And they are ALWAYS around. Tipping, commenting. For some reason, none showed up on that post. It made it to the top of r/bitcoin too. Way to contribute when it matters.

Why are you so angry? A dollar a day considered wealthy? Nowhere in the world is that considered wealthy. That's below the world poverty line. Here in the Philippines, more than 50 million people live on a dollar a day, and no matter how poor they are, nobody considers that wealthy. "Been in communities"... how vague can you get.

I posted something similar to your post. It isn't just the antagonism for bitcoin from dogecoin that got to me but the self-importance they give to themselves for growing the subreddit faster and being more "fun" and not too serious. They act like they arent taking it seriously but if you look at the dogecoin subreddit, there is a crazy zealous vibe that they really believe dogecoin will surpass bitcoin and be worth a lot more than it is (to the moon!). 
I even saw a post of a guy who said he sold his 7 BTC for doge because he got disillusioned by this subreddit. What the actual fuck right? You make you financial decisions based on subreddit activity? 
Building economies is a serious business. Building value is serious business. There's so much more to the world than reddit and they have no idea.

Hey man, posting personal info might not be a good idea here?
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:52:07
With your logic of picking a random amount of time (six months) to determine the success or failure of Bitcoin, I can also pick a random amount of time (say, ONE year) and say Bitcoin has been a success. 
Why is six months an important amount of time? Why not one year? Because it suits your agenda. 
The most objective way to go about this is to get the price of one Bitcoin since it started having a price and compare that to the last price as of today. You can't  just pick a random segment in time that suits your desired outcome. Because you can do that for every other stock or asset that is volatile and get the figures that reflect your position.

Dogecoin is funding charities? The Jamaican bobsled team? Roger Ver donated 1000 bitcoins to FEE.org last year. A million dollars. What's your point?

Wait for the press release from the Philippine red cross and compare the amount of BTC vs pesos then. Meanwhile, do something productive. You're a CEO for chrissakes.

If you bought for $20, you would probably have sold at $100. Or after it crashed from $266 to $50 overnight, maybe you would have cut your losses. With your logic you can also say you shouldve bought amazon and apple stock, maybe silver and gold as well. 
Hindsight is always 20/20, but nobody knows that the future holds. Security matters are only scary if you take it out of your hands and trust others with your money, and the whole point of crypto is "you are your own bank". 
The Bitcoin cryptography itself on the other hand, is more secure than anything in the universe. Literally you would need to break the [known laws of the universe]( to even just COUNT to 2^256. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:26:26
What problem? Being too serious? I take my work seriously. I have been involved in projects that created hundreds of jobs for people who had none. I am currently working HARD to make Bitcoin accessible to people who will never have a chance to own a credit card or even open a bank account. Why would you feel bad for me?

@_date: 2014-12-05 01:25:43


Yes. From 3% to 1% that was basically what happened. We are a young inexperienced  startup and learned on the fly. Is there something wrong with that?


At 1%, we already beat any kind of traditional remittance companies at the most common use cases. We're quickly learning ways to maximize efficiency. We're getting feedback from our customers and learning. THis is the reason we are once again adjusting our rates even lower. It's called competition. In the meantime, I just got an alert for a P1000 ($22) remittance. They paid P10, or 22 cents. Please show me anything like that with any other company existing today. This is our competitive advantage. 


Between the four largest remittance corridors (US, CA, UAE, SG) [according to the World Bank,]( the average is currently 4.1%. For amounts lower than $200, the most common use case, it is more like 6%+.

Yes you are right. This is why we want to empower entrepreneurs, no matter how small, because in the middle of all this poverty they are the ones actively doing something about it. You can't uplift those who don't want to be uplifted and see poverty as a reality they can't escape. There is a lot of brainwashing in the massess here to keep them poor and voting for their favorite politicians who give them the most dole outs.
We're identifying those who refuse to do that and find ways to help themselves.

The business model does not work like that. Utlity companies do not need to endorse bills payment companies, and they usually don't due to exposure to liability.

I just realized you are right. Traditional remittance rakes in their money by exchanging USD to PHP more than the actualy remittance fee. We make profit by trading out BTC to PHP or USD more than the actual remittance fee. The difference is we don't let the users eat this cost but rather trade it on the free market.
Fundamentally though, we are still different technology wise.

Oh yes that middle driver seat was awesome! And yes, the fact that they still race it against a Bugatti Veyron to "test" the Bugatti is a testament to its engineering. Can you believe that the last one was produced in 1998, 16 years ago?
It is quite rare (the CS. )It is the only one recognized in the GT/CS registry. There are two more supposedly, but that's it. 
As for the McLaren MP4-12C, someone got caught smuggling one in one of the ports here, it was sitting inside a 40-foot container! I am pretty sure no one owns one here. Luxury tax makes exotic cars cost 300% more here, yet you see a lot of Ferraris and Lambos anyway.

Not any amount. You can use [Xoom to send up to $2,999]( and pay only $5.00, yes, but their exchange rate is padded by around 2.0-2.5%. 
You're right though, for certain amounts and certain services, it is cheaper to use other means. The ones who cannot access these services are the ones Bitcoin remittance providers are targeting. 
[According to the world bank]( the average cost of sending money to the Philippines this year is at 5.75%, and worldwide it is 7.9%, which is an all time low. Even at 3% for services like Bitpesa, it is still cheaper.

I agree with your point about Bitcoin's real value as a P2P solution. That is what I see as the end result when this technology achieves mass adoption.
I disagree with your point about Rebit not helping us get any closer to that. I believe we are driving new users to use Bitcoin right now, and making people see the technology in a positive, constructive light. We're working on things like targeted remittance where senders can directly  purchase goods and services, pay bills and other things, or send money as it is needed, using Bitcoin, doing it programmatically or automatically. 
We do see ourselves as a transitional service that will pave the way for what Bitcoin can truly achieve. I personally don't see pure P2P bitcoin adoption happening anytime within the next decade, at least here in the Philippines. 
Using Bitcoin opens up new markets  like sub $100 remittances previously infeasible for traditional methdds. There is a lot of  room for innovation and development in the space.

You're talking about [Bunny Baker]( and [Mr. Delicious.]( I posted those as well. Bunny Baker is a Facebook-based mom-and-pop shop that delivers cakes and pastries all over Manila. Mr. Delicious sells artisanal sundries in a weekend market for one day a week. Both of them are my friends and now are part of our growing network of Bitcoin accepting merchants just like Wingman. They were the first merchants to accept Bitcoin in the Philippines.
I could hardly consider them "brick-and-mortar" because by definition, it should be an establishment in a permanent location, preferably with a foundation, walls, and a roof. Usually with city business permits and stuff like that.
I can assure you, you will not find a single establishment here today officially accepting Bitcoin with a sign on the door that says "bitcoin accepted here" othee than wingman, but that isnt going to be the case for long as we enable more merchants and establishments all over Manila and the Philippines.

Most online sales here are done on social media, like instagram and facebook, and payments are done physically via meetups or visiting a specific bank. We believe Bitcoin can empower the little guys who cannot afford to accept credit card payments or paypal and even give some of them a chance to open up to a broader global market. 
We're still in beta stages right now and testing our systems with a few merchants. We hope to have hundreds, if not thousands of local merchants and services accepting Bitcoin before 2014 ends, so anyone can buy quality locally made products and services and visit the Philippines  and be confident that they can use Bitcoin anywhere  :)

I think you should not mix up "market price" with "value". The price of bitcoin on an exchange and the value of bitcoin and the bitcoin protocol are two different things. 
Millions and millions of dollars of capital funding, investments in infrastructure, time, manpower, effort, computing power, hardware, practical applications, and much much more are being added to the total value of the Bitcoin ecosystem every single day.

@_date: 2014-02-17 09:54:00
Yes I understand this too, but not a lot of people do, especially the average person (average in terms of understanding money and finance). Even just printing a paper wallet with your private key on it makes it tangible, just like a bank note. Since the value lies in the private key and it is on that paper wallet, technically that paper wallet is now a tangible asset of value. 
Explaining Bitcoin really ends up with explaining the concept of money itself and the many layers of abstraction surrounding it.

To say there is "virtually nothing else" implies that you know the future for certain, and is very closed-minded. Maybe there is nothing else as of today, but Bitcoin is in its infancy and the technology needs to be developed further. It won't happen anytime soon.

Third only to China with $70 Billion/year and India with $60 Billion/year. The Philippines, with 1/10th the population of those countries, receives over $25 Billion a year in remittances. It is a prime candidate for Bitcoin to get adopted in a big way.

The plan is to develop Rebit as a platform that won't earn on the remittances itself and find other revenue models by using the bitcoin ecosystem. We're developing  things like targetted rebittances wherein the sender not only can send money, but directly pay bills, shop for groceries and medicine, and make sure the money is spent where it is supposed to be spent.

Marc Andreessen said some great stuff about it in comparison to the internet when they were pitching netscape to companies. 
"When we started Netscape, we went around to a half-dozen media companies. Every one of them told us this internet thing will never amount to anything. They basically said, "Fuck off, there's no market here." We went around and met with all the telecom companies, and said we need high-speed connections because this dial-up thing isn't going to cut it. Only one, MCI, agreed with us. All the others said, "Fuck off, this thing is not for real, nothing is going to happen with this thing."
We went to retailers and talked about e-commerce, and they were like "there's nobody to buy anything. Why would you put e-commerce online if there's no shoppers? Plus don't you know you can't trust the internet? You can't put your credit card number on it."
We went to the payment companies, to Visa and MasterCard. They said "What do you mean, there's no shoppers, there's nothing to buy, who gives a shit?" So they told us to fuck off.
It was a very comprehensive "this can't possibly work."

Right now we can only imagine the future apps that will be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol, so I can only assume people will develop (some are actually in the process of developing) better applications for the technology. Certain internet applications like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and the like would have been unimaginable in 1993 too. 
One application is Smart contracts. From the wiki: "A distributed contract is a method of using Bitcoin to form agreements with people via the block chain. Contracts don't make anything possible that was previously impossible, but rather, they allow you to solve common problems in a way that minimizes trust. Minimal trust often makes things more convenient by allowing human judgements to be taken out of the loop, thus allowing for complete automation."
From something I read from CNN money:
"The most speculative and long-range potential functions of peer-to-peer finance and smart contracts are forms of what's known as "Smart Property." Smart contracts are agreements enforced not by law, but by hardware or software that would "fully embed in property the contractual terms which deal with it." Telecommunications combined with the Bitcoin blockchain presents more intriguing possibilities -- for example, cars able to read the blockchain could disable themselves if a loan payment wasn't made on time. Mike Hearn, one of the main developers of the Bitcoin architecture alongside the mysterious Nakamoto, has said that any implementation of the concept is at least a decade away because of the need for hardware upgrades on physical goods.
The functions that advocates say could be automated through the Bitcoin network seem nearly endless, including peer-to-peer investment funds, Kickstarter-like crowdfunding, binding arbitrations, and even non-financial transactions such as naming rights management and encrypted communication. And all could be executed without a cut for intermediaries. Bitcoin partisans, from developers down to rank-and-file users, often seem to revel in the idea that they are threatening the control and profits of Wall Street institutions, who they see as rent-seeking fat cats. If it were limited to the loss of fees on payments and transfers, bitcoin's threat to existing financial institutions would still be substantial."

It depends on the amounts. Using Bitcoin saves a lot of money for small amounts like nothing above $200. The bigger the amounts, the less the savings, but ultimately sending using Bitcoin is cheaper no matter what.
I am not sure if we have any Fil-Norwegian users as of now, but if they have access to cheap Bitcoin, it will definitely cheaper and can be received the same day.

Great play on words. I feel the same way.
In response, I am working on a Bitcoin startup company in my own country. I am spreading adoption to users and merchants alike. As simple as asking all business establishments you patronize if they accept bitcoin will plant that seed in their minds, and they will remember you when the time comes to do so. 
The technology is so much more than just currency. Just make sure people hear about it. Adoption and acceptance is what builds the network, the community. 
After all, without the network, the community, Bitcoin is just a source code.

Subreddit is a gauge of adoption? You should get out more. It is not. R/bitcoin is actually considered a joke by most people, and echo chamber for religiously positive news and a place to NOT discuss pros and cons. Once in a while, yes, there are great discussions. 
There is such a thing as bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org, with more members for a longer time and actual real discussion with the people involved with Bitcoin. 
You guys are trying to make it sound like a competition, but isn't. $10 billion and $54 Million is not. Yet you honestly seem to believe that Bitcoin won't be number one forever and that yes, admit it, Dogecoin will surpass it. 
How about we bet 1 BTC that Bitcoin will still be number one after 2 years? Just for fun?

If you run the Bitcoin client on your computer, you are a node in the network and you get a vote. There is a core development team who are experts in the Bitcoin code and want to improve it/ look for bugs, but any change they make has to be agreed upon by all nodes. 
We are actually in [Bitcoin v.09]( today. When a new update is agreed upon, everyone downloads the new update. Bitcoin is software, a protocol, and there are bugs and fixes that are bound to happen, and the network will do its best to keep everything in tip top shape by making adjustments for the good of the network agreed upon by the network.
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:26:56
We actually have about 30 more in the pipeline, and growing. It actually takes about a week on the average to close down a merchant. Lots of hard work, but we have a amazing team. So far they do "get it" and think it is cool. Some are skeptical but that's normal.

We give it away. Basically, we made a social media bitcoin faucet. You can earn 600 satoshis per like up to 50 likes a day, and even .05 mbtc for every user you refer that verifies their account. We're trying to get users to be familiar with Bitcoin without the intimidating "tech" factor.

If Rebit succeeds and gets just 2% of the entire Philippine remittance industry to use Bitcoin, that's 500 million dollars in annual revenues based on  last year's remittance numbers. At 10%, affiliates could earn five million dollars annually, for basically pointing people towards our direction once, and getting them to sign up and use the service.

@_date: 2014-12-09 16:35:33
Why would Rebit need to send Bitcoin to recipients? People can do that purely peer to peer. They don't need us. Our business is "send money to the Philippines". 
Anyone can send Bitcoin to anyone, no need for a third party. Converting it to pesos is the hard part.
Right now our other business  has over 200 merchants, nothing significant, and theyre all in Manila. The Philippines has 7000 islands and 100 million people, and 99% of the country wont have bitcoin accepting merchants. Hodling is not an option because of volatility, maybe for richer people yes, but most Filipinos live on $200 a month.
If you buy pesos with Bitcoin, you will end up with Rebit anyway because we guarantee the best exchange rate in the market.

Hi! I agree with you about Rebit.ph being a game changer in the remittance space. The fact that we can use the system to allow people to remit at low as $22.00 and still only pay 1% for in *international* remittance is absolutely impossible with any other system.  Once people understand this, the shift will be fast.
I am more optimistic about Bitcoin's other uses though. Our other [ventures]( tackle most of the mainstream uses of Bitcoin and we even found a way to integrate it with social media. I think more innovation is coming and with the advent of the Internet of Things, Bitcoin is the only thing that makes sense.

Those are not our partners, they are our competitors/ companies that do Bitcoin business in the same space. We are about 1-2 years behind most countries in terms of adoption, and only this year are we seeing news articles of drug busts using bitcoin transactions (ala silk road). So as a parallel, north america is basically over that aspect of Bitcoin. Our company bitmarket.ph will not compete with those exchanges for now. How about you wait and see before making sweeping judgements about how we will do our business?
You obviously don't go anywhere except Manila, so of course you won't meet anyonr outside Manila who knows about Bitcoin. There is a thriving community on Facebook of almost 2000 members, and Bitcoin communities in Visayas and Mindanao. We are having a Bitcoin meet up in May in Manila and are expecting 100+ people, and we are doing it in a restaurant that accepts Bitcoin through our company. 
We have also raised thousands of dollars for charity using bitcoin, and we haven't even really begun aggressively marketing this.
We are working on solutions. We know the problems you so intelligently pointed out. We are talking to the right people and forging partnerships and ventures to create more services and products for Bitcoin.
We have been at work for about only 4 months. We just started. You're right, it will take a while before we catch up, but we have the means, the right people, and the will to do it.

Are they still accepting Bitcoin? If I go there, will they take it?

Yes, they do, at least here in the Philippines. These are people without bank accounts, not homeless or jobless people living in the mountains. They have jobs, they live in the city, they have families and homes.
The Philippines is a country of 100 million people.  Internet penetration is at around 35 to 40%. Acccording to a recent study, 1 out of 4 Fiilipinos now own a smartphone. Literacy is at about 97.5% here. In the capital region of Metro Manila, a highly urban and commercialized area, the population is around 21 million. So yes, they have internet, electricity, and a smartphone or access to a computer.  
Yet less than 5% of people have credit cards, and even less have  deposit accounts. E-commerce is almost non-existent.

No. The core devs have been working non-stop from as early as 2010. There was no growth prior. When I started learning about Bitcoin, the Market could be moved by someone sneezing. It could have been destroyed by anyone with just enough money or power. Even Satoshi himself discouraged wikileaks from using it early on because he was scared it would attract too much attention.

Western union and moneygram have a stranglehold on that market right now. An "exchange" with a 10 point spread might not be any much better but at least it is moving forward. The answer is in getting the people to understand and use bitcoin on their own somehow.

It is pretty simple actually. If you have P1,000 worth of BTC (about $23~), just go to the Rebit.ph website and input P1000. There will be a computation for you on the side in real time. 
If you choose any of the banking options, meaning we will deposit the pesos directly into your nominated person's bank account (there are 19 banks to choose from), the total will be P1,010. 
You can actually go to the site and try it out without really sending anything. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 05:30:38
It is happening at a predetermined rate so they know it will end in 2140. The incentive is if Bitcoin is still around by that time, transaction fees will be considerably bigger than the block reward because of widespread adoption of bitcoins. Millions and millions of transactions per block will be an incentive to keep contributing processing power.

We understand that the margins are very small for now, because the volume is very small as well. The thing is, we're trying to disrupt a $25 billion a year remittance industry. This year alone from January to July, the Philippines took in $15 billion in remittances. If we can get even a fraction of that to move to using Bitcoin, it should be worth it to passively sign people up to use the service (one time thing) and passively earn money on the side. 
Also, we have an option for institutional affiliates to sign up (as companies/ organizations) and get 20% of the revenue. Now if you were an exchange in, say, the US,, where there are millions of Filipino workers, and become the go-to point of sale for people to buy bitcoin, you make money on that side as well. You earn from the exchange (usually 1% like coinbase) and then earn an extra % on the revenues of your Rebit affiliate. 
We're technically still in beta, and these things can change too. We'll find out what works and adjust accordingly. Believe me, we have thought about this a lot and wish we could offer more incentives, but with Bitcoin, the point is to make remittance cost a lot less. :)

Just like what the world wide web did for communication and media. It will take a while, but probably much faster than the decade or so it took for the internet and WWW to become an essential for almost every household in developed and even developing countries.
In the Philippines, [less than 50,000]( people have actual bank deposit accounts. The population is about 100 million. Yet 40 million have internet and 100+ million have mobile phones. Bitcoin can be massive if it plays out right.

Bitcoins are the only currency accepted in the Bitcoin payment network. They are produced by the network by miners verifying and securing the transactions, as an incentive to do the work. This gives it an initial "value". 
The market exchange price is really just white noise happening in the background. If Bitcoin goes to zero, it means a fundamental and unfixable flaw has been discovered in the protocol, which means yes, it would die. Something would probably replace it. 
This cannot be uninvented. It is out there, and it cannot be stopped. The internet has been trying to find a native currency the last 2 decades, and Nakamoto figured it out.

Not just the rates, but the amounts. Most Filipinos working abroad send less than $200 at a time, which explains that "sweet spot" the most remittance companies use when increasing fees.
One company here charges a $12 for anything below $120. That's just plain predatory. With Bitcoin, using Rebit.ph,they can send $120 and only pay$ 3.60.

This is very true. Rebit.ph, at its core, is really just a Bitcoin selling site. We buy your bitcoins at the best rate possible and exchange it to pesos at the best exchange rate possible too. The 3% fee is basically there so that we can keep running our business and provide the best service possible.

It is more about looking ahead. Do you think that the value of a trustless, distributed, impossible to counterfeit, and decentralized electronic value transfer system is going to be worthless to future generations? Then Sell. 
The price of one bitcoin right now hardly matters except to day traders. The utility of Bitcoin has not changed. No major flaw has been found in the system. The infrastructure being built right now wont mature until a few more years from now. 
Unless you're gonna go hungry if you don't sell your 2BTC, Might be better to just forget it and come back a year later.

Mining is processing and verifying and securing transactions. The whole "solving complex math puzzles" is very misleading. It is a dumbed down explanation. The miners are responsible for the transactions being verified, the miner or pool of miners who "win" the lottery aspect are the ones who get the coins.

Thanks for the kind words! One of the founders of Rebit here. 
We're cheaper for most use cases, especially $200 and below. We have been adjusting our pricing in the last 5 months or so of operation and from 3% we are now down to max 1% and even less for bigger amounts. 
We're growing fast. We're barely 6 months in and exceeding all our targets and expectations, with no marketing or promotion. I cant publish actual numbers but we are growing month on month by more than 50% in volume, and [recently hit big milestone]( by doing as much volume in one day as we did in our first month.
We're still learning and adjusting and growing the business. There is an AMAZING team behind it who make it work. Hopefully we can scale to a bigger level soon!

I don't understand how it works? And you do? 
No that's not *exactly how it works*, that's how *you think it works.* You're making claims yet you have no hard data to back it up. 
Reddit does NOT represent a broad cross section of society, unless you are American. Even in the US, only [6% of ONLINE ADULTS]( (not the population) use Reddit, and most are young adult males. That is not a representative sample of society. 
Reddit has about 69 million users, active or not, and that is .01% of the world's population. That is not exactly how it works buddy. I live in a country of 100 million people, and I can tell you with confidence that the number of Reddit users here are next to nothing. r/philippines has 5,500 users, that's it. 
The reason we take this seriously is that it is real money, real jobs at stake, real companies we are forming, real people we are working with. We are very passionate about it, and you can take that as being "serious", but that's what adults do. 
You say you don't give a shit yet here you are in r/bitcoin, taking potshots. "You already lost." What the hell does that mean?
Your statement that the only reason Bitcoin is  is because it is popular and not because it is superior is so stupid it hurts. I don't know about your background in programming, if you have any at all, or background in economics or business or anything, but hundreds, if not thousands of the greatest minds of computer science today has peer reviewed the source code of Bitcoin and can only say it is pure genius. It is not a popularity contest. If Bitcoin was flawed, it would be long gone. Five years is an eternity for any business to last, much less something that has never been done before in the history of the world. 
Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, who has put $50 million in Bitcoin startups, [made a bet]( with Felix Salmon that by 2019, five years from now, 10% of Americans will be using Bitcoin.

Who wants to tip with Bitcoin? Check my history. My last few bitcointips were at least $28. I have given away  more than 1 bitcoin just the last month or so to spread the word to actual people who want to start using it. Heck i even tip dogecoins, and i have thousands of that. 
Just by saying "Bitcoin is expensive" shows how much you don't understand it yet. I can buy $10 worth of bitcoin, and $10 worth of dogecoin. They are the same price. That $10 will buy you the same thing in the real world.
You keep bringing up r/bitcoin yet I keep telling you that subreddits mean nothing. I'll repeat that, take away the subreddits, and what do you have? Bitcoin has 200 billion dollars in capital investments worldwide, a $10 billion market cap, 35,000 merchants, and tens of millions of dollars in VC funding, and millions of people using it. 
To each his/her own i guess. If you really believe in something, no amount of reasoning will change your mind, and I am not here to change anyone's mind.

To add, the reason it is called a block chain is that every ten minutes, the Bitcoin software creates a block of x-number of verified transactions, and the miners who get to "prove" this gets the reward. This block then gets added to the previous block of "true" transactions, connected to the one before that, and the one before that, all the way back to the genesis block, validating the "chain of blocks" as a true record of history. I hope that made sense! ;) The block chain is simply a ledger of all bitcoin transactions.

Bitcoin is not just about "investing". Actually, it was not designed for investing at all. It was designed as a payment network, and people can actually use it without "investing".  If my friend across the world wanted to, say, borrow money from me instantly, I could buy bitcoins with my cash and send him bitcoins instead of wiring money to him. It doesnt mean I am an investor.

If you send 1000 via REBIT, you pay 1010, yup! The other fees are not our fees. It is there as an option, for everyone to see. Was that hidden? Are we 2go pay? Did Rebit make money off of that? Nope.
Nothing is hidden. We don't claim you "only pay $4.99" then rip you off at the exchange rate. If you don't want to use it, nobody is forcing you. 
Is it hard to understand that those are *not* our fees? Do you need me to explain some more?

Very interesting to hear how totally different people from far corners of the world can have similar thoughts and ideas about something. I guess it is the nature of this technology and how once you start to understand it, it pulls you in.

*In first world countries, yes.* but the rest of the world, like here in the Philippines, only the privileged few have access to payment systems like credit cards, debit cards, paypal, or whatnot. 95% or more do not even own a bank account. 
Small merchants selling stuff online do it informally, meaning to pay them you would have to physically go to a bank, deposit money, and send a photo of your deposit slip as proof. 
Billions of people all over the world have many incentives to use Bitcoin both as consumers and as merchants.

Hi Bruce! One of the founders of [REBIT.PH]( here, a [Rebittance]( company out of Manila, Philippines. We've been running for 6 months now and have gained a lot of traction in the US and southeast asian markets.
We have been keen on expanding our network to the middle east, where 2 million Filipinos work as contract workers. Are there any reputable bitcoin exchanges that can serve as on-ramps for bitcoin remittance to the Philippines? We have the last mile totally covered here and recipients basically get pesos in a few hours and pay only 1%. We'd love to explore how we can partner up with a local Bitcoin company there and help our countrymen save some money on remittances!
As you likely know, the PH is the 3rd largest recipient of remittances in the world at ~$26 Billion annually, with 10 million Filipinos spread out all over the world. Two million of them are in Saudi, UAE, and Qatar, and they send home at least $2 Billion a year.
Great work in the bitcoin community, really admire your passion. I still remember when you posted your house for sale here a year ago!

Right now it is too early to say anything, and we are still basically in beta stages. Maybe in the next couple of months we will have some numbers but it is still too small now. 
We just went for it. We have a poster in our office that became our unofficial business philosophy: Ready, fire, aim :)
Just tonight I ate in Silk Road and the waiters told me they had another Bitcoin customer today. It's a good sign. 
Edit: About the funding, we are fully self funded for now. We understand that there won't be a lot of revenue in the beginning and are prepared for it. We are also currently working on new projects that we believe will be more focused on making revenue. Bitmarket.ph is really our way of introducing Bitcoin and ourselves into the ecosystem.

Coindesk? What are you reading?

What we did not see is the early, early, early stages of google and facebook meaning when the VC's were just putting money in and they were not publicly traded companies yet. The time when they were tiny with 20 employees and begging for funding. 
The thing about bitcoin is that the public gets to be a part of THAT stage as well, which is where we actually really are right now. This is venture capitalists territory and everyone who gets in this early gets a stake in that. 
Another thing is the adoption curve is much much faster now than when google and FB came out because there were no smartphones back then. When the time comes for Bitcoin to go mainstream, it will be  FAST.
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:00:48

[123 Billion dollars flow out of the US to the rest of the world]( The thing is, remittance also includes companies sending payroll or operation liquidity to their offices in other countries, including third world countries.
I agree with you that the speed and scale at which it will happen is unpredictable, but the title of your post is a huge claim that I will have to disagree with: third world countries like the Philippines, where credit card penetration is 3% and remittance averages 6-9%, the use case is too great to ignore.
I think you are underestimating the ability of people to adapt and learn new things. They'll find a way, both the service providers and customers.

We just started a company that aims to educate and empower small online merchants and entrepreneurs by introducing them to Bitcoin. It is a grassroots movement to spread Bitcoin adoption among the locals. 
With regards to remittances, we believe that that will come with adoption. There is no "remittance business" with Bitcoin. People will naturally learn that they don't need western union or moneygram and that they will save a lot of money by directly sending to their loved ones. 
The more places accept Bitcoin, the less the need to convert to fiat. It's a long term project for sure, but we believe in the technology and think that it will really change things for the better, especially for the tens of millions of unbanked people here. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:54:57
I've honestly gone past the "price" obsession with Bitcoin and am going more for the Value and utility, meaning building businesses and helping user and merchant adoption in my home country instead of day-trading bitcoins or hoarding them for speculation.

We would love to see the link where you can pay **only 13.8%** to send P1000 via western union so we can adjust our comparison rates on the site. We would gladly update any wrong information to reflect the correct rates.


If you checked the options at the Rebit website, you will see *nineteen* banks where you can choose to send your international remittance to the Philippines and not be charged anything. You can send P1000 ($23~), pay P10 (23 cents), and get your money in your bank account in the same banking day. We've done it many many times now, for many different people. What do you mean, *we don't even provide such a service?*


why are you falsely stating what people will pay on the send page? For example:
You claim it "starts at" 5-8 PHP to pick up cash from a pawnshop, yet when I select pawnshop the fees are 40-50 PHP. When I check LBC, which you claim "starts at 59 PHP", when the fee is actually 80 PHP.
I suggest you try using it before knocking it down. Throughout the entire process of sending BTC to REBIT for rebittance to the Philippines, your cost is computed automatically right beside the page. Everything is there for you to see, it is completely and 100% transparent. "Starts at" is a perfectly acceptable term, and in no way a misrepresentation. The fees for the domestic remittance part are not our fees. These people pay the same fees to send money from within the Philippines. Before you hit send, you will know how much you have to pay, there is no deception here. 


-I'm sorry, we are a small startup company and cannot afford 24/7 operations. If you don't want to use our service, we completely understand. Comparing us to a multi-billion dollar company is a little unfair at this point. We are *two months* old. One day we hope we can staff ourselves to operate 24/7 too/


Yes, Bitcoin is cheaper for **international remittance**, just like what  said on my post. I challenge you to input *ANY* amount in the Rebit page and choose a bank payout option. You will **always** only pay 1%. Try doing that with Western Union. 
Send P1000 ($23~) via REBIT, choose bank deposit option, get money within same banking day. Cost: P1,010. Choose pawnshop payout near you: cost P1,060.  
Send P1000 ($23~) via WU, pickup in a WU outlet of choice. cost: P1,138.

Satoshi didn't expect Philantrophic miners but if a 51% attack happens, Bitcoin suffers a blow that could cripple it or even kill it, therefore rendering your entire investment useless from that time forward. All that money down the drain. That's the incentive to be honest I think.

If you took the time to actually look at how it works, you would not have made that assumption. The Bitcoin isn't exchanged to Peso up until the moment you redeem them and they get sent to your wallet. 
The P1,000 will always be P1,000, so *when* you redeem the Bitcoin will determine how much Bitcoin you get.

End to end Bitcoin remittance (cash in - cash out) is already happening in the HK to Philippines remittance corridor via  and  Companies like Align Commerce are already doing value transfers for institutions with a cash in - cash out solution, and the sender and receiver won't even know they are using Bitcoin.
Pretty big statement you made there, without any knowledge of what people on the ground are actually doing to make [Rebittance]( a reality. We're working ur asses off and are doing actual work right now that allows money to be sent to the Philippines at a 1% cost instead of the typica 6-9%. 
Filipinos, of which more than 10 million are working abroad, speak english as a second language. If english speaking is your argument, then it is invalid. Now if you are  saying they won't adopt Bitcoin NOW, I'll give you that. It will take some time, I say several years, before Bitcoin can even tap into the 500 billion dollar remittance market significantly.

So I take it that you have considered or tried Bitcoin remittance and deemed it too ineffective? If so, then I can respect your opinion. But for our many customers who use us regularly, they tell us about how much they save and how efficient our service has been for them and that they are satisfied. They are growing in number too. I guess for bigger users like you, it wouldn't make sense. For the senders who send us sub-$100 regularly, it matters.
We're small, we're young, we're trying hard to deliver and make it work.   And your last statement is something we all agree on: we work so that one day, our service becomes obsolete. That's when we know we've done our job. This is the reason why we also have a [payment processor,]( a [bills payment service]( a [prepaid bitcoin card business]( and an [orderbook exchange]( and even a [social media app for bitcoin]( Rebit is just one key element in the bitcoin value chain we hope to establish.

To answer your question, we at Rebit.ph are drawing up plans for a long term education and information campaign for OFWs, starting with small focus groups and Filipino organizations abroad. There are major plans and changes to our marketing and implementation as we speak. 
We just realized that this model of a "cheaper money transfer" isn't what Bitcoin was meant to do. It was meant to do what the internet did to telephone companies and media. Because of this, even Rebit.ph is going to go through some major changes soon.
To address your other point, we *are* working together and harmoniously with every other *Filipino* Bitcoin company here. We plan on working together to spread bitcoin adoption and use to Filipinos because we are Filipinos ourselves and are in this for the long haul, and not to make a quick buck.

Because there are MILLIONS of merchants in emerging markets who **cannot afford to accept credit cards at all.**
Merchant who have a great product or service yet cannot do e-commerce because of the barriers of entry. Do you know how much volume of sales you need to even be allowed to accept credit cards? Bitcoin solves this. At no cost.
Many countries in emerging markets are banned from Paypal as well just because they are in a certain country. If you look at the Bitcoin payment system from a global perspective, it is a whole different picture. There are services that take away the risk of volatility by exchanging the BTC into Fiat at the point of exchange. This eliminates risk on the merchant side.

The Bitcoin Protocol is not a "thing" that anyone can own. A protocol is a set of rules that is followed by a system, in this case, a computer program, the Bitcoin client. 
Right now, if I am not mistaken, we are not even in version 1.0 even after 5 years (we are in v.09 I think). The Bitcoin protocol is governed by the consensus of all miners, meaning any kind of change in the protocol must be agreed upon by everybody. 
It is decentralized. There is no "head" to chop off. Instead, every node in the network owns and is part of the whole thing. If one computer is left in the world running the Bitcoin client, it would still work. 
You are correct, the utility of Bitcoin's payment networks has massive potential and value. The thing is, the payment network accepts only one form of currency: bitcoins. This is why bitcoins also have value.

I receive SMS alerts for the donation address for Aislinn, and so far it has received two donations of .012 and .02 BTC. This is the stuff about Bitcoin that gives me goosebumps of the good kind... I mean, someone somewhere in the world, out of the goodness of their hearts, decided to send $5 or $10 to another person across the world who they think might need it more.
For me, this is amazing in so many ways. The potential of this technology to do good just boggles my mind. Thank you, kind madam or sir who sent those small amounts of Bitcoin. They DO matter.

"Without community, Bitcoin is just a source code."
That's some awesome stuff right there. 
I feel the same way. My worldview has changed considerably and I never actually thought that something would ever stimulate my mind again as much as my previous successful and unsuccesful business endeavors. After 33 years of living, life was kind of getting boring. Then I got BIT... by the Bitcoin bug. 
You biology analogy is brilliant. I love how the Bitcoin network grows in a positive feedback loop and that every single breakthrough and brilliant new idea helps every other node in the network. Every development increases the value of the entire network. And now I realize that these "nodes" are actual PEOPLE, and that we are all in this together.

I've gone from obsessively checking the exchange rate every day to finally "getting" what Bitcoin means, and now to actually finding like-minded people and starting one of the first startup Bitcoin companies in this side of the Pacific. 
It took me a while to understand that "Vires in Numeris" or "Strength in Numbers" actually mean two things: Strength in numbers, meaning people, and numbers meaning math and cryptography.

Exactly. The current fiat model isn't exactly the best example of "owning" value. You end up really just holding a piece of paper that says "this is backed by the governement so it has value".
It has been months of non-stop absorption of information, and the intellectual exercise that Bitcoin and the whole space gives me is nothing short of amazing. I am in my thirties and never thought that I would be intellectually stimulated again like I was when I was in college, or working a new job, or even when I was building a new business. This is such a breath of fresh air in terms of mental stimulation and that alone for me is worth the whole ride.

Wow this is an eye-opener. As much as I would like to believe in social media and Reddit as a great example of a free market for information dissemination, this tells me otherwise. 
"Trust and verify based on behavior rather than based on hearsay." And really, what is a traditional media but hearsay? I have paid many a journalist here in my home country to print favorable articles for previous businesses I was involved with, and know how media (at least here) are mostly in the pockets of the rich and powerful. 
This is one of the reasons I am in awe of the blockchain and what it represents. A true trustless system, trust by computation and proof-of-work and nothing else.

Satoshi Nakamoto had an elegant solution.
"The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth." - Satoshi Nakamoto
Basically, if you had enough computing power to overtake the network, all you could really do is allow double spending and/or prevent transactions from being confirmed. If you use this same computing power to just MINE the bitcoin yourself, it will be more profitable for you.

The truth is, Bitcoin has been dropping and rising in price for the last 3 years. What you see is called volatility. Look at a [3 year chart]( and you see that from the moment 1 bitcoin had a dollar equivalent in 2010, the direction has been going up steadily. If you look at a [short-term 60-day chart]( it goes wildly up and down. 
"Crashes" are mainly due to speculation in the markets (exchanges are NOT what Bitcoin is all about) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the media (basically, bad news). When it goes up, usually it means that good news is coming up, or new markets emerge (like china did). The thing is, on the long term scale, the price has been consistently going up,  in a really good correlation with the increase in adoption (merhcants accepting and bitcoin addresses being created. 
We don't know how far it will go down, or how much longer. Nobody does. If anybody knew then they would practically be fortune tellers and they should be billionaires by now. One thing has been consistent up to this point though, and that is that the long term charts show an upward trajectory. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:02:59
A positive feedback loop is basically "A" produces more of "B" which in turn produces more of "A". 
S it could be anything such as if people want Bitcoin it will make the value go up which in turn will make more people want Bitcoin and so on and so forth.
It could be negative too, depending on the context. Bank runs are positive feedback loops.

Five years after the internet was invented, nobody knew what the hell it was. TCP/IP came in 1982, and so did SMTP (email), and was followed in 1983 by DNS. The INTERNET was invented in the 60s'. The modern version of it was in use by the early 80s'.
More than 12 years later in 1995, the internet only had 16 million users worldwide. The internet took quite a while before reaching exponential growth. 
Now if you still don't think the Bitcoin is like the internet, don't take the word of a random stranger on reddit and maybe read what [the inventor of the web browser]( has to say about that. 
Because that's *exactly* how he describes Bitcoin today.

That's been my strategy since the beginning. Started buying at $250, and bought every month on the first week of the month, sometimes more than once a month if I have more fiat. Buy, hold, spend, tip, buy again. Everytime I spend BTC, I make sure to buy as soon as possible too. 
It has been a pretty good strategy so far, even with all the major swings I have sat through.
I just see no point in saving money in fiat anymore. I see this as a part of my long term savings.

Everything you said was damn accurate. It is even worse than it sounds. I had a $100 that I wanted to quickly exchange into pesos in a major bank and end having to show TWO government ID's with photo, filling up two forms, and taking 20 minutes before I got my pesos. 
If you have to go to the bank, prepare to be there for at least half an hour lining up. We're ages behind the rest of the world.

Who said it isn't growing? How much was a Bitcoin 1 year ago? It was Sub-$100. Two years? In 2012, Bitcoin peaked at $13. Bitpay had just hit 1,000 merchants in 2012, compared to 35,000 today. In 2011, Bitcoin peaked at TWO DOLLARS. In 2010, somebody bought two Papa John's  pizzas for *10,000 bitcoins*.
Dell? Dish? Overstock? Newegg? 
Want to  start with Venture capital money pouring into Bitcoin today compared to a year ago? In the 1st quarter of 2014, VC money was more than the last 4 years combined. Hundreds of millions of dollars. Xapo just got $40 Million in funding.
What are you talking when you say "stopping Bitcoin's growth"? You want it to grow *right now*? That won't happen, that's ridiculous. Five years is nothing in any business.

You really have to understand that Bitcoin and the blockchain are inseparable. Without Bitcoin, nothing will incentivize the miners to keep securing the network. The blockchain is a product of Bitcoin and not the other way around. Bitcoin IS what Satoshi invented.

Although I love tipping, I suggest you do it privately or only to those who are open minded about it. It can cause some backlash if done improperly,  like giving 10 cents and such. Make it count, make it matter. Give a top quality comment and make the tip an afterthought, not the focus. 
Most people don't like it when people start "preaching a gospel" to them ;)

If Bitcoin is still around in 2140, it would be safe to assume that it also has worldwide adoption and thus have millions and millions of transactions each day. Transaction fees will be so big that the block reward will not even be relevant since it is being cut in half every four years.

We are really thankful to the Reddit Bitcoin community for shining through once again with a generous amount of donations for a worthy cause and helping the Philippine Bitcoin community. It might seem like a small amount but it takes much longer than a few days to raise that kind of money in a place like the Philippines, if you don't have the right connections. 
Here is a link to the original post last week:

You forgot the exchange rate padding. 
Currently, [Xoom's exchange rate of USD to PHP is $1 = P43.65.]( Rebit uses $1 = P44.95. That's a difference of 2.97%. 
Using your example of $5000, if you use Xoom, you pay $5.00 PLUS your recipient eats a $148.5 exchange rate hit. They get, in pesos, **P218,250.** 
If you use Rebit.ph, via Coinbase, the total fees of for BTC to USD and BTC to PHP is 2%. At our exchange rate (no padding), they get $5000 and sender pays $100 total fees, so the net amount is **P220,255** for a savings of P2,005 or about $45.00. 
You also pay $5 to $6 USD for bank fees/ debit/credit card fees on the sender side. I didn't bother to include these in the computation. They only show up at thee very end of the sending form on Xoom's website. 
Tell me which is better.
@_date: 2014-02-23 04:51:59
To be honest I just thought you were being an ass. Internet forums leave something to be desired when it comes to conveying subtleties in communication between people. You are right, I did do that on purpose. I was thinking a little humor would get the post some mileage, because otherwise it would just get buried. But looking at the title, there was nothing that wasn't truthful about it, no deception, except for any preconceived notions about boats and bitcoins by individuals.
I thought you were actually saying I was misleading people and in a malicious way. Apparently I was wrong. Peace!

What part of decentralized and peer-to-peer is hard to understand? Bitcoin does not need banks or wall street. 
Bitcoin related businesses, on the other hand, will need them. And the countries who will regulate these tightly will see none of them. The companies will just operate in friendlier countries. They'll make it illegal? Just like downloading movies and music? They seem to be pretty successful with that. Not.
I am damn disappointed with this development as I was kind of hoping that Circle was going to be a great company for Bitcoin.

The Philippines is a huge emerging market that we believe has the potential to adopt Bitcoin in a big way due to many factors. One example is our remittance industry, which is the third biggest in the world at around $26 Billion annually. Bitcoin can disrupt this market and save a lot of Filipinos working abroad a lot of money in fees.

I don't believe in "convincing" people. Convince them to what? "Like" bitcoin? Believe in it? Invest in it? It sounds too much like evangelism to try to convince others. 
I personally am very open and vocal about it and if people see and ask, I **explain** it to them with a pretty much scientific explanation of hard facts. I show my enthusiasm and admiration of the technology and what it stands for, but I will never try to tell someone to "go on board."
I like to see it as similar to facts, like scientific facts. You don't need to convince people about facts. Facts are facts. It doesn't matter if you believe it or not. 
Bitcoin is a technology that is also an idea whose time has come, and it will continue to grow and blossom into a full blown "technological tour de force" (in the words of Bill Gates) even you don't "believe" in it.

Thanks to your inspiring talks and simple yet easy-to-relate-to approach, I have learned a lot about the power of this technology and its massive potential, and now I am taking it upon myself to get this message across to as many people as possible.

We have previous business experience with other different businesses so that helps a lot. Also, we are very, very familiar with the business environment locally so that is a big plus. 
Bitcoin is a totally new kind of animal though, so the best part is that there are no precedents and that other than a couple of really successful companies like Bitpay,  you are free to make your own template.

Host country: USA
Home country: Philippines
URL of company: [Coinbase.com]( and [Rebit.ph](
Amount sent in host currency: $250 USD = .6766 on coinbase, PLUS the Rebit fee of 1% which is $2.50, for a **total of $252.50.** 
Amount received in home currency: $250 or **P11,156**
Total cost: It cost the sender 1% for the USD to BTC conversion on Coinbase, and then from Coinbase to Rebit, another 1%, **for a total of $5.00 USD.** 
Process followed: Rebit has Coinbase integration and you can actually send directly from your coinbase account connected to your bank account to Rebit, and then from the Rebit interface choose the receivers bank account in Manila where they will receive the money in Pesos (no BTC to Peso exchange rate fee for Rebit). 
This is a great challenge. Although it has been tackled several times extensively before, it won't hurt to revisit it again. I've been in many discussions where comparisons were made and all things being equal, Bitcoin remittance, or [Rebittance]( will win (by a small margin) in the most common use-cases. And in specific cases like sending small amounts, Rebittance tears western union a new one every single time. 
The thing here to really consider with this example is, we're comparing a a multi-billion dollar global behemoth to a 6-month old Bitcoin startup out of the Philippines using a 5-year old technology, *and the fight is already almost even, with a slight edge going to the underdog*. The only reason WU isn't charging an arm and a leg right now is because they have scaled to a point where they can drive their margins down and still be profitable enough to make their stockholders happy. 
The best part is that Bitcoin remittance services like us aren't just going to stop with what we are doing at present. We are actually working to drive our costs lower, make our rates better (better than 1%!), and ultimately make Bitcoin invisible to both the sender and receiver. 
Just so you know, I am one of the founders of [Rebit.ph](

I'll make sure the Rebit team sees this, this is something that really makes our day:) Thanks!

I was wondering why you answered like this and then I saw your username and realized you ARE Andreas Antonopolous!
I am a huge fan of your work in the Bitcoin community and use your talks and podcasts to learn more and more about Bitcoin. I am from the Philippines and we stand to gain a lot from Bitcoin adoption since we have the 3rd largest remittance market in the world. I am working with some great people in the Bitcoin community here and we are building the grassroots foundation for Bitcoin in the country. 
Maybe one day we can invite you over to the Philippines! :)

The right way to do the conversion is to get the Coinbase USD to BTC conversion and then BTC to PHP conversion of Rebit. Right now CB is .6658 BTC for $250 USD, and then when you input .6658 on Rebit it comes out to P11,207 (as of this posting). There is a P28 peso difference with direct USD to PHP rates, so if you add that to the cost then the total cost will be $5.63. 


No, it isn't an unfair advantage. The cost of getting a money transmitter license in the Philippines and getting all the proper regulation in place won't change the fact that Bitcoin can send money as if it was information, and do it practically free. We are actually actively pursuing compliance and preparing for proper regulation, and are in the process of applying for the proper licenses in our industry. As a tiny startup, this is going to take some time, but we're going to get there. We can get the same licenses, the same regulatory compliance, and operate a similar business while still being a lot more affordable than traditional remittance. 
The real unfair advantage (in favor of Bitcoin) here is the technology behind Bitcoin versus the technology that Western Union is currently using. Right now, Bitcoin remittance is clunky and costs way more than what is possible to achieve with the technology, but that is changing *very* fast. Traditional remittance have had decades to optimize their services and are still struggling to get global remittance costs down to 5%. Bitcoin does this better *right now*, at its current state. Imagine when we get to streamline and optimize Bitcoin remittance, and believe me, we are working hard to get there as soon as possible.

What are you doing here then, tipping away pennies at people who just lost thousands of dollars? Unrelated subreddit? I see SO MANY dogetips in this thread right now. 
I just made an observation, and it is true. Not *one* doge tip in that thread, in a subreddit infested by doge tippers. That's the truth. Do I buy your reasoning that not a single dogecoiner saw the top post in r/bitcoin yesterday? Don't think so.

You are obviously ignorant about the technology behind the currency, or you could be trolling. Bitcoin is a *peer-to-peer electronic cash* **system** , according to its creator. It is a payment network. A decentralized consensus network that eliminated the traditional need for a trusted third party. It just so happens to have a currency of its own, something that cannot be counterfeited or used twice.
Maybe learn something first before making arguments?
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:01:30

We are actually working on the SG-PH remittance corridor as we speak, working on ways to make it as cheap and easy as possible. In higher amounts yes, Rebit is not as competitive, but the average remittance is around $200 and below, so the use case is still very strong for rebittance.

But the problem is we are talking about real money. It can't be too easy if you are storing thousands of dollars or more into something. MP3 can be "stolen and you would hot care because they are not worth anything. I believe it has to be as simple as creating an electronic banking account. You STILL need a certain level of safety and security measures.
I HOPE they invent something that will make it as simple as possible though,without sacrificing security.

We aren't operating at a loss with 1% because in a business like this, revenue can be generated through other channels. We have also been operating in a long term bear market, but have still managed to grow anyway. In a bull market, we can grow even faster. 
When a customer sends 1  BTC to the Philippines, we lock the price in at the moment of the trade and they have 3 hours to complete the transaction. There is always a risk with volatility, especially if the price suddenly jumps wildly, but so far it hasn't been too much of an issue.

I'll tell you how. In 2010, the first real world bitcoin transaction happened when a guy wanted to buy [2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins.](
This became the basis for putting a real world value on what a bitcoin is worth in terms of dollars. The pizzas cost roughly $50 and so there you have it: 10,000 bitcoins cost $50.
A man doing his thesis on encryption also [bought 5,000 bitcoins for about $26]( forgot about them, then later found his wallet file in the last quarter of 2013. 5000 bitcoins were worth $850,000 by then. 
These things set the precedents for what people are willing to pay for bitcoins. Supply and demand in a pure free market will determine it from there.

Basically it is like asking to buy a different currency. Bitcoin is in its simplest form, money. Best way to get Bitcoin is to earn it by selling a product or service. Then there are exchanges, simplest one being localbitcoins.com. ALWAYS use escrow. It is pretty simple.

@_date: 2014-02-03 18:12:42
I just read a great [article]( on Bitcoin Volatility and price stability. 
Here's an excerpt:
"This brings up the question of what a good price for Bitcoin would be. When will Bitcoin stabilize? It should become less volatile as it becomes more widely adopted because it will be harder for local events and individual people to affect the price very much, right?
Not necessarily. Although perhaps we will see less wild daily swings, I think Bitcoin is unlikely ever to attain anything like a stable price. If Bitcoin’s price were stable, this would mean that it had achieved an equilibrium with the other currencies. There would have to be some sweet spot at which there is exactly the right balance of bitcoins and dollars. When Bitcoin’s price went a little bit too high, people would start to sell for dollars, and when it went a little bit too low, people would buy more bitcoins.
To anyone who thinks this is possible, I ask why would any equilibrium happen? What would it possibly mean for Bitcoin’s price to be too high? Unlike just about anything else, a higher price for Bitcoin does not reduce its usefulness one bit. One simply trades in smaller amounts of it. In fact, a higher price makes Bitcoin more useful because a higher price indicates that more people want to buy, which means that Bitcoin’s liquidity grows, which makes it more useful as a currency.
Therefore, I would suggest that we should never expect an equilibrium between bitcoins and dollars or any other currencies. Instead, Bitcoin should show a pattern of hypermonetization. It will become more and more valuable at a faster and faster rate in terms of other currencies. Its price chart should show an asymptotic increase that approaches infinity after a finite time.
Bitcoin may stabilize in terms of real goods, but I see no reason to think that it will stabilize in terms of other currencies. Once Bitcoin starts killing the other currencies, it will still be volatile, and this will still be an indication of its success."

The value of crypto currency has nothing to do with the price on an exchange. Its utility is the same, its technology is the same,  the invention does not change if it is $100 or $1000 or $10000. Yes a higher price means more widespread uses but you need to get over this obsession with the price to really understand how important this invention is to humanity.

Hi! First of all, where did you get that Rebit takes 2-3 days? It takes 2-3 hours on the average. 
Have you factored in the exchange rate for your $1000? **At the [Western Union website]( your $1000 will become P44,125** (plus you have to deduct $2.99 or P132 from that) at the time of this posting. **Rebit's rate at the time of this posting is P44,670**. If you deduct the fee you of P403 you paid , it would come out to a total of P44,267. No more pawnshop fees need to be paid since Rebit charges zero for Bank deposits. 
**P44,267 with Rebit** (in 2-3 hours) vs **43,993 with Western Union** (in 2-3 days).
The reason we can compete is that fewer than 1% of users of Western Union have the luxury of doing bank to bank transfers to themselves and send amounts equal to half a years salary to most of  them. 
The average amount remitted to the Philippines is ~$200. Do your comparison there and see why we can compete. 
Better yet, try sending $50 from the US to the Philippines.

I actually agree with you in terms of Applepay actually being a great step towards getting people used to paying for things using a smartphone or device.
I just made the comparison of Bitcoin and ApplePay because, well, I felt like I needed to make that comparison from a different point of view (the third world perspective). 
I actually think that if Bitcoin succeeds, it can even be used by Apple as a payment option. And like my title says, I found it amusing that this "new" thing uses credit card technology which really is very terrible as an internet  payment technology.

I love this. Whenever I thought about payroll in bitcoin I always thought in the context of the traditional sense but instead of Fiat, it would be Bitcoin.

You're wrong. Without people working their assess off to develop bitcoin core, working tirelessly to create new innovative products and services, speak about and represent bitcoin in a positive way, lobbying with governments to not stilfe the growth of the technology, Bitcoin would not have made it this far.

She did *have* to send it in USD so she actually got hit by the PHP to USD too. Sending money out of the PH is a lot more expensive than sending it in, because the central bank discourages capital flight out of the country.
Those things you gave as examples are not even options for most people here. Here, if you try to withdraw money from your own bank using a different branch, you have to pay about $2.20. It is ridiculous. 
Maybe you live in America (or any first world country) where Bitcoin is this curious new technology that nobody really needs. It's not the same for most of the rest of the world.

*An idea has entered my consciousness and infected my thoughts, an idea so potent, so wide reaching that it consumes my waking hours and I know I'm not alone.*
*The past few months have felt like a blur. Surely this bug will spread to others. Man's ancient problem with communication once stood as an insurmountable barrier to true globalization. But upon two generals bewilderment, the solution lay in the mist along with the enemy armies of the Byzantine empire.*
*Today, a workaround has been found and its implications are immediate and will remain with humanity until its eventual demise. It took until the 21st century, via the blossoming of the greatest tool in uniting the globe; the internet, for a masked ingenuity to deliver a radical social experiment. In layman's terms, the bitcoin network allows for a user to send digital information securely to another person, no other parties needed.*
*The advent of such an idea affirms the notion that we are indeed experiencing a shift in the tiers of civilization. Failing the emergence of a critical bug in the protocol, humans can now rely on a digital token to exchange value, in a form that would have made Aristotle proud. Centuries from now this network, or some variant, will represent humankind's digital persona; our actions, our faith, our instincts.*
*The network's complexity will be immense and it's durability will be essential to our survival as a species. Great sci-fi poets such as Asimov envisioned a global network that is an infallible representation of man's common ideals. And in 2009, the foundation for Asimov's dream may have been realized.*
*But lately, I've obsessed over it as if it were my existential duty to build on the network in some way. Like an infant drawn to the new texture of an object that has just entered their awareness, I am drawn to bitcoin. I had no idea I'd experience such awe in my life again. Though I'll happily accept the opportunity to contribute to the prosperity of this global organism.* 
*Long ago, humans grappled with the rawest concepts of money and the result allowed for an expansion of civilization. Now we have to adapt again. It may not seem like a critical invention at this moment, but technology has the odd tendency of revealing it's necessity to a select few who pay attention first.*
*Slam my conviction if you want, but it will remain unwavered in the absence of a better solution.*
*Now to find the solution to what ails me. How do I leave my mark, my value on this network of the people before it takes a less malleable shape? I am not the first, nor the last to be captivated by the possibilities.*

The main business of Rebit in a nutshell is that we buy bitcoins from people, and pay them in fiat. They assign this fiat to a nominee, and we deliver the fiat to them within a few hours. 
Revenue comes from exchanging the Bitcoin back to fiat at a profit through our liquidation channels. Either our other bitcoin businesses, trading through exchanges, or from selling to regular buyers on our Bitcoin selling site  Rinse, repeat.
You really cant compare it to traditional remittance. Fees are unneccesary here.

I gave the example of our other services as one of the ways in which we make use of our bitcoin. Basically Rebit is a place to sell your bitcoin at great rates. You can Rebit to yourself if you want to convert Bitcoin to cash. We have the best rate in the country, guaranteed. Probably one of the best in the world. Our other businesses sell bitcoin at a higher price, so there's no BS in that.
You're right though, the focus of a 7 month old company like us is to build our business, expand the user base, create a demand, and provide a great service. We can't focus on profit at this stage. No business should. If we fail, we fail. If we succeed, we succeed. We're gonna do our best to succeed of course.

There are lots of ways and opportunities to monetize Bitcoin, and we learned this in the last 7 months or so of operating several Bitcoin businesses at the same time. We're taking this knowledge and using it to drive down our costs as low as we possibly can while still building a viable business. 
Rebit.ph is just one of the services under [Satoshi Citadel Industries]( a Universal Bitcoin startup running multiple services like a payment processor, prepaid bitcoin cards, and even an order-book exchange.

That's exactly where we are heading, actually. We're already doing it with Bitspark.io in Hong Kong, one of the biggest remittance markets that send money to the Philippines.
The Filipino workers there just give fiat to Bitspark, which is then sent to Rebit and converted to fiat again and delivered to the recipient directly. Bitcoin is essentially invisible to the users. 
With Coinbase, we also integrated with their site so that you can do an instant buy from your USD bank account connected to coinbase and send that money directly to Rebit. 
We've figured out the the "last mile" in the Philippines, now the hard part is getting these on-ramps in different countries to establish themselves as the "first mile" for the service.

Hi! Sorry about that! Thanks for the warning. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:59:39
We at Rebit lock the conversion rate from Bitcoin to Pesos/fiat *at the moment the transaction is made*. It says it right there on the site. The recipient doesn't even know Bitcoin was used.
As a business, you start from scratch and build a reputation for service and trustworthiness. You also go through a whole lot of trouble to actually set it up, hire people, get customers, etc. We don't force people to use the service.
There are no guarantees except the fact that we go to jail and lose our reputations in our community if we decide to do something stupid. I know scammers are everywhere and it is good to be vigilant and ask questions. Only time will tell, I guess.

How? Where? Person A sends BTC worth 1000 pesos to Person B's bank account via Rebit. Person B receives 1000 pesos in their bank account. There is literally no other way for person B to get more pesos for BTC except through Rebit. Where's the fee?
Rebit *guarantees* the best rate in the Philippines for buying bitcoins. Even if the sender sent their BTC directly to the recipient, theyll end up selling it to us for fiat because we have the best rate.
Is it really that hard to understand?

The Philippines has 11 million of its 100 million population living and working abroad, sending home $26 Billion annually (last year's number, and it is growing). The third biggest in the world next to China and India (who have billions of citizens). Remittances account for 11% of our entire GDP. 
We receive 70 million dollars a day in remittances. Bitcoin remittance IS a niche though, seven months old to be exact. We just started, but of course hope to tap into this "little" market.
Right now we are bootstrapping, and are making these decisions based on how we have been running the business the past 7 months. Revenue was pretty tiny even at 1%, but the arbitrage opportunities we get from our other businesses allow us to increase the margin 2 or 3-fold. The decision to remove the 1% was just to capture a bigger market share in a highly competitive market. 


We are not monetizing yet, we are just grabbing market share and racking up user base. BUT we also make a little profit on arbitrage opportunities presented by our business. I hope that satisfies your curiosity at last.

I didn't mean to come off as dismissive, my apologies. 
We have a [comparison page]( on Rebit.ph which shows our fees and rates, which we believe is 100% transparent. All we will ever charge is 3%. We use the best rate for USD to BTC and the best rate (yahoo finance) for USD to PHP. 
We also put up  for a comparison of all available rates in the Philippines. If coins.ph is cheaper according to your computations, I won't argue with that. When I did the math yesterday, I was pretty sure we were a fraction less expensive. 
It would be up to you to choose which service to use. Thanks for the kind words. :)

We're focused on inward remittance to the Philippines, which is in itself the 3rd biggest in the world at $26 Billion a year and growing, but yes, we are building partnerships with Bitcoin companies in the major remittance corridors to the PH like Hong Kong, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada, and the US.  
We've already established one in Hong Kong with Bitspark.io, and are actively working on the others as we speak. Hopefully by the end of 2015 we would have locked down all the major corridors and help our fellowmen save money when they send it home :)

From our end we have not enabled any merchants in Cebu just yet. I don't know if any are individually accepting Bitcoin (Some probably do). Expansion plans include Cebu of course.

[Less than 50,000 Filipinos]( have deposit accounts. Even a lot less have checking accounts or credit cards.  
Our population is close to one hundred million people. Western Union has a huge monopoly (there is moneygram but they are not as big) in remittances over here, and they charge obscene amounts. 
That's a great plan for Bitcoin remittance! Maybe we can work on something together once we decide to tackle the issue. Our goal right now is an awareness campaign first. People have to know about Bitcoin and the only way to do that is through a grassroots campaign which will take some time.

The company that onboards these merchants is called Bitmarket.ph, which we started in May of 2014 and of which I am a co-founder. We've been working hard the past year just getting merchants and services on board and have about 250 total as of today (most of them informal online merchants that sell stuff on Facebook, which was the whole purpose Bitmarket to begin with). 
I recently posted a [map of the merchants in Manila where you can physically spend Bitcoins.]( 
So funny, the buttcoiners absolutely hate me for promoting a company I helped build, in a country which I was born and raised, in a bitcoin forum where I am allowed to do so. They're really an amazing bunch of guys and I love that they hate what I do! :)

I am really in no position to divulge business information about our company at this point in time of our growth, especially without the consent of my other partners and founders.
We're barely 7 months old and still figuring things out. We've gone from 3% (not competitive) to 1% (competitive but only at certain amounts) to now zero fees (definitley competitive, more attractive, and more honest.) We don't need to charge a fee, because bitcoin is so easy to move from point A to point B.
What are our plans for the near future? We share this information to parties that need the information, like investors. Why should we share it with the general public? We have competition too. Why should we give anthing away?
Nobody here is entitled to any information, especially sensitive business information.
When the time is right you'll see all the info you want. Or we fail and fold. We're a business, and we're under no illusion that we're bulletproof. We're doing our best to provide a great service and build a solid business, that's our focus.

Traditional remittance is a system of accounting and debt. Bitcoin sends the *actual* money across borders, which is unprecedented. It's like teleportable gold.

Absolutely wrong. If you had any idea about how Bitspark works, they are an on-ramp for fiat in HK that accepts fiat and sends Bitcoin to [Rebit.ph]( in the Philippines, who then off-ramps fiat directly into the hands of recipients.
Cost, complexity, and time spent in acquiring Bitcoin is absolutely irrelevant to the equation.

Say you are mining Bitcoins solo. It is really like betting on a lottery with a single ticket, one with an infinitesimally small chance of winning. You have a chance, but it is practically impossible. 
Mining boils down to a digital lottery that is weighted based on the amount of computing power you are contributing to the network. The more power you have the better your chances are to win the lottery.

I grew up and live in the Philippines in a city with 21,000 people per sq.km, one of the poorest in Manila, and have interfaced and interacted with these people all my life.
You'd be surprised how someone who earns $200 a month also has a smartphone, uses social media, and finds the idea of Bitcoin very interesting.
When you talk about those who just want "food and water for the week", well, there are a lot of them here too. I see them walking the streets everyday, begging, scrounging for food in the garbage. Of course they won't find any use for Bitcoin.

That's awesome. I am one of the founders of  and the guys over at Coins.ph are good friends of ours (albeit we are competitors, the bitcoin industry works on a "positive feedback loop" and every success for a competitor ends up being shared among everyone in the industry. It's a a beautiful thing, if you ask me!). 
We've know this fact for quite some time now and even considering the cost of acquiring bitcoins, Bitcoin remittance (or what we like to call [Rebittance]( always beats the likes of WU in sending sweet-spot small amounts. I've had detailed discussions and analyses with many people here on r/bitcoin, hell, even some heated ones with known buttcoin trolls, but it is hard to argue with cold hard numbers.
Not only that, you are right, the speed and efficiency is also a big factor. At Rebit, we have an average turnaround time of about *one hour*, more or less. We're constantly striving to get better at what we do too, making it faster and smoother for the customer. The best part? Coins.ph and Rebit.ph and other companies like us have *only just begun*.

Bitcoin is the name of the protocol. "Block Chain" is just a play on words when a solved block is added to the longest chain of previous blocks. 
There is no "blockchain" in Satoshi's whitepaper. Without Bitcoin there is nothing to put in blocks and create a chain. You cant explain the blockchain without Bitcoin.
Your description is accurate too, although it only explains one facet of the Bitcoin protocol.

Merchants accepting bitcoin do not need a license. The exchange where they convert it to fiat will be the one who needs to get a license. 
In our conversations with the central bank, they are very aware that there is now way they can try to regulate p2p bitcoin transactions. They instead chose to focus on the entry and exit points of BTC to fiat and vice versa.
If merchant decides to keep the BTC, their stance is do it at your own risk but we wont try to regulate that.

@_date: 2016-01-15 03:25:44
That's OK, sounds like an exaggeration but it is not. 
The transaction itself actually took less time. The payout option chosen (Cash pickup via Cebuana Lhuillier) is why it was so fast - we are [officially partnered with them]( and are connected into their system, making the process almost instant. 
It took 15 minutes because we had to walk out of the office and pickup the money down the street. You can try it yourself, just ind someone in the PH to pick up the 6 bucks :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:27:11
We at  takes care of this on the spot for our customers. Your recipients never even interact with Bitcoin at all. They get the cash in their bank accounts, or delivered to their nearest remittance outlet (local pawnshops like cebuana lhuillier or Palawan express) which number in the tens of thousands and can be found anywhere in the country.
In terms of spending Bitcoin, [Bitmarket.ph]( have enabled 200+ merchants and counting. Mostly in Manila for brick and mortar places, but also a lot of online informal merchants selling things on facebook and the like.

This is really what people are having trouble grasping, especially in the money transfer industry - We want people sending small amounts frequently instead of the usual "send x amount and only pay this small fee" model. 
It's really going to be a paradigm shift. Bitcoin enables these "impossible" transactions and does it elegantly.

OK. Sending $200 on Rebit.ph right now (11:33 am Phil. time) and choosing this same cash pickup option will cost 0.49893200 BTC, and the recipient will receive P9,538. Google shows that USD to PHP is 1 =47.85, making $200 equal P9,570.
The total cost would be 1% for acquiring Bitcoin via Coinbase or Circle, and then 2.4% more or less for the 3rd party fee, so about 3.4%. 
That should be right :)
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:47:26
Hi, great to see more people getting into the rebittance industry :) I am one of the co-founders of  and we have been doing this for a while now.
One flaw i see is for places like the Philippines (where I am from) is that most people do not have a bank account to receive those funds. With Rebit, our most used payout option are the non-bank channels. If you can address this issue especially for the bigger corridors like the PH (3rd biggest in the world annually), that would be big plus for you. 
Best of luck!

The community is pretty active. Adoption is great because us and our main competitor are really working hard to make things happen. Even the central bank is looking at BTC as something good.

Great video!
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:04:06
Pretty simple and good.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:00:15
This is pretty good! Instead of a central authority proving you have the balance to transfer, the network will just check it on the public ledger. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:58:14
Blockstream is the shiznit. Meanwhile, some assholes want to maximze mining profits in the short term and risk the network's integrity so they can buy starbucks with Bitcoin.

Exactly what I was thinking when I read you comment! Wences is really great at this.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:22:40
The point was to get someone's attention enough to make them want to learn more. My example was exactly what I answered to the same question and the person was completely satisfied with the answer.


You just lost your listener there. "Watches everything"? "Rules" are followed? It's very very vague.
I cant even count how many bitcoin talks ive done to a.very diverse range of people, and it really helps to be simple and use direct analogies.
Saying bitcoin is like real coins when you transfer from person to person makes no sense, actually. Can you transfer a real coin on the internet?
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:24:23
This is the right mindset. I started buying at 200 in 2013, bought all the way up, then down, rinse repeat. Still buying now, using it as money, saving some. Dips are awesome for buying more with my shitty fiat. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:01:43
Man this made me laugh out loud, especially with this drop just earlier.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:36:24
Oh sorry if I wasnt clear. I was talking from the viewpoint of a listener who has no idea what crypto is, not trying to get you to answer the questions. I didnt need you to answer because I wasnt asking a question.
I know how what those things mean. I know what everything you said means. But the random guy at the elevator doesnt. 
"Your ignorance is clear." Uh, sure man. No need to go Ad Hominem on me buddy. I could care less about your explanation, I just wanted to give away some bitcoins, like ive done a million times before.
Of course I can copy it many times. I can only spend it once, but to say it cannot be copied is totally false. We are trying to explain to a stranger in an elevator, not trying to sound smarter than we actually are. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:00:43

The composure this guy has is pretty awesome.I did a live interview on Bloomberg TV (local) here in the Philippines and it was all about Bitcoin, and I don't even remember what I answered until I watched it all over again. I even kind of fumbled it a bit by mentioning the finex hack when they didnt even ask about it! Live TV can be quite nerve wracking, and he handled it like a boss.

Just on a piece of paper, 12 words. The wallet recovered and made a new one but it didnt have the BTC. Thing is, he didnt use imported addresses so it should be there.

First of all, it is not impossible for something like Bitcoin being banned in China to happen. But is it probable? No. It is actually highly improbable. 
China is largely misunderstood especially in the west (the US to be exact). I personally know some top people in the big chinese exchanges, and they are really just business as usual. They know that these growing pains are necessary to prepare the industry for the near future and the long term play. Their government is not at all hostile to them, in fact, they welcome them to look into their business so they can get legitimacy. 
There is a lot going on behind the scenes, work being done, smart and well-resourced people coming together to make it all work. China will play a big role in the development of Bitcoin in the years to come. 
The price of Bitcoin is the least interesting thing about it.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:05:29
It is a good start, yes. But how? Why?
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:36:27
Unused. The old addresses still contain the BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:20:56
Yes and you were right, I had a wrong understanding of this aspect and gladly appreciate the knowledge. Thanks!

Organic adoption of any tech is when people actually USE it becomes an integral part of their day to day lives. Not due to hype, not due to mania. 
For example, the multi billion dollar online gambling affiliate business is starting to adopt bitcoin. Bovada, one of the biggest online gambling sites, recently forced their affiliate marketers to accept their commissions in Bitcoin, just because wiring money every month was less efficient and more expensive..
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:03:12
Yes, this. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:52:56
Wow. Sorry to hear that. We are not connected to them in any way.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:57:31
Do you know that for it to go to 10k, the market cap would have to go to 150 or so Billion dollars? And for 100k, 1.5 Trillion? Where is that money going to come from? 
I am a long time hodler and run a bitcoin startup plus I totally believe 10k and 100k are not impossible, but only in a time frame of 5-10 more years. 
EDIT: Was wrong about market capitalization. Thanks for the correction.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:52:14
It is already happening in China with WeChat. It isn't Bitcoin, but the idea is the same.

We had this made in early 2014 and it has been hanging on our office wall ever since. More relevant than ever today!
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:54:21
Hey man, I think we have a winner here. I like your answer because the analogy would make it easy for anyone to "understand" or at least grasp the concept. Nobody knows how email or VOIP really works, but they get that it does, and if BTC works similarly, anyone can get the concept. It also touches on the "no middlemen" narrative, which is important because it is a reason why people would actually want to use it versus traditional methods. 
So yeah, since we don't have changetip anymore, please give me your Bitcoin address so I can send .01 BTC your way! Cheers!
@_date: 2016-11-27 11:40:48
Hey sorry didnt catch this. It isnt out ATM, but if you need to exchange BTC for cash, try Rebit.ph. You can choose yourself as the recipient and pick up the cash from our office or any of the remittance outlets all over manila.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:54:11
Nah, a friend sent it to me. Would like to reach out to the owners and enable them to accpet BTC though!

Dont worry, a lot of us working on the space dont really care much about this arguing and just keep on growing our bitcoin businesses!
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:35:24
I am just saying that there is a lot to be desired from your answer. Look at it again, from the point of view of someone who know zero things about monetary policy or economics or technology. It makes no sense. 
How can you transfer bitcoin "like a real coin"? It is nothing like transferring a real coin. I can't physically hand over a Bitcoin to you, right? And you can't send a coin over the internet, right? 
When you say autonomous network watches everything, what do you mean? And what rules do you think are being followed? 
Also, you are wrong about "cannot be copied". You can copy Bitcoin as many times as you want, that's why we have altcoins. I can also make copies of the Bitcoins I hold.  
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:34:40
We invented that term!

Kakaotalk actually invested in our Bitcoin startup. They also just got an internet banking license. I was in South Korea a month ago amd the bitcoin remittance industry there is really picking up steam, with companies like Sentbe, Payphil, etc gaining a lot of traction. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:07:56
Great job! Really awesome to see more services similar to ours (Rebit.ph) thriving in the market. When we started it in 2014, it was a real uphill battle, especially with the price taking a nosedive and Bitcoin's integrity being questioned.
2016 showed us that it can thrive and gain real traction, with record transaction volumes month on month! Looking forward to seeing the Rebittance industry explode in 2017!

A bunch of scammers launched and ran it. Roger Ver, Craig Wright, Calvin Ayre, Jihan Wu. It was a cash grab, sold at the top by those in the know, now it's at all time lows and has almost no transactions/empty blocks, hash rate that is like a tiny % of Bitcoin's, and development that's a fraction of what Bitcoin has. 
BCash also claims it is the real bitcoin, and deceives people that are new. Many have sent real bitcoins to bcash addresses and lost them forever, or bought bcash thinking they bought real BTC but then find out later that it is a worthless knockoff. 
It's so scammy that the scammers themselves had a falling out, and now we have the dumpster fire that is Bitcoin SV, an even worse version of Bcash. It's like a knock off of a knock off. They are both trivially easy to destroy with a fraction of Bitcoin's hashrate, but miners wont even bother as there is more money to be made just using the hash power to mine Bitcoin.

Bitcoin? From online poker players who wanted to sell it for cash to my friend. It was early 2013 and my friend kept telling me about it. Price was $30. Saw it go to $266 then crash to $50. Didnt touch it til october, then when I learned enough and understood it I bought my first 1.5 BTC for P15,000 ($290) in total.

Mining costs a lot. The money you will spend on electricity, hardware that will be obsolete in a few months,  and other things associated with mining to get a small amount of BTC is better just spent buying BTC directly.

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:06:55
No, it literally cannot become Bitcoin.
Bcash is a currency? Does anyome actually use Bcash? We process millions of dollars of Bitcoin remittances each month. Absolutely nobody uses Bcash.
If one day people want to use Bcash more than BTC, as a business we will probably accomodate them, but we won't start calling Bcash Bitcoin. It makes absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:34:38
Was able to dump the last few BCHs I had... at $2,500! First damn time I timed a sell that perfectly. Dumped minutes after. Now holding a few extra BTCs for ZERO cost! Cheapest Bitcoins I ever got, and I bought my first 1.5 BTC for $295 ;) 
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:27:09
You'll be buying 1 satoshi for 1 cent at that price.  100 sats = $1
Believe me, the thought of people buying Bitcoin at even just $1,000 was not too long ago seemed like a pipe dream. When Bitcoin hit $1, it made headlines. They were declaring it dead when it dropped from $30 to $2, and a popular tech publication saying it will probably never hit that high of a price again.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:24:36

We process millions of dollars in transactions for thousand of overseas Filipino workers abroad sending money home through Rebit.ph and our on-ramp partners abroad.
Guess what? They don't have to know about Bitcoin, and so do their receivers, yet they still save a lot on fees compared to Wester Union or banks.
These people couldnt care less about Bitcoin in the same way they dont care about the SWIFT network. They just want to send money home cheaply

The fact that people try to scam bitcoin out of others means it has value. There are gold scams, lottery scams, dollar scams, and the like. *People* scam other people. The medium doesnt matter. Since bitcoin is new, there are a lot of people taking advantage, just like the email scams of the 90s.

Nobody needs to liquidate all their assets to prove their wealth. If someone owned a considerable amount of Bitcoins, then it forms a % of their total net worth. Yes, Bitcoin is now seen as a viable asset class by some. 
Thats why people only take out investments or sell assets as needed, yet are still wealthy. Some rich people dont even hold much cash. In Bitcoin, you dont have to cash out to realize its value.
Disclaimer: I run a Bitcoin company out of the Philippines and process millions of dollars in monthly transactions on our bitcoin remittance platform Rebit.ph. A lot of people "cash out" all the time - we have processed single 7-figure USD transactions, yet most are sub $500 on the average.

Think of it as playing part in a global social experiment, something that could potentially do for finance what the internet did for media and communication. 
I am sorry to say but it is not a get-rich-quick scheme. A few billion dollars have been invested in Bitcoin startup companies in the last 2 years, more so than the internet itself in 1995, so it is quite a serious development. People who bought cheap domain names in the early internet days got rich too, but that was just after the fact that it would turn out valuable in the future. 
If bitcoins  jump up in value again (in 2009, 1,300 bitcoins cost $1.00, today ONE bitcoin costs $290 or so) then it's just a bonus.

The five other services were bitmarket.ph, coinage.ph, prepaidbitcoin.ph, bitstars.ph, and bills.ninja. We've since focused all of them into Bitmarket, Rebit, buybitcoin.ph, and upcoming bitbit.cash.
The fees were keeping us from being truly competitive across the board. The bigger the remittance, the more it was cheaper to just use another traditional service. Revenue is earned via the trading desk, where we trade the incoming BTC out for a small.margin.

I saw ONE newspaper article of a college drug dealer getting caught in a big private university selling ecstacy for bitcoins, that was it. That was about 18 months ago or so. 
Ponzi, well, there seems to be a prevalence of Multi level pyramid schemes here and abroad targeting ignorant Filipinos to "invest" money in their company which will then use that to buy bitcoins and somehow make it earn 30% every 3 months or something. I'm afraid these fuckers might affect the image of Bitcoin to the general public in the long term.

It simply uses a [cryptographic hash function]( to convert the data into a small file that can be included in a bitcoin transaction. 
Let's say you have a land title or contract that is several hundred pages. Using a cryptographic hash function, you convert this into a string of random characters that is only a few KB in size, and add this information in the bitcoin transaction (there is space in a bitcoin transaction to sign a message in every transaction).
By doing the transfer, you timestamp the document in an immutable ledger.

Number three is still a possibility. Maybe it will be unintentional on their part but if they pull off heavy regulations or something similar, it will be hard for us to adapt.
Bitcoin cant be classified into something, because it is a class of its own. The governments need to understand this. We're having a dialogue with the PH Central Bank right now and luckily they seem to be open minded about things.

You can choose Cebuana Lhuillier or similar options as the pay out method and the recipent will be able to pickup Philippine pesos in any of the tens of thousands of their outlets in the PH.
They are almost in every street in any region or province. The recipient doesnt have to worry about exchanging the BTC anymore.

Depends on what you mean by many. There are quite a few bitcoin addresses with millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. We know this because the bitcoin blockchain (the public ledger) can be seen by all online.

I am from the Philippines and co-founded a Bitcoin startup that helps people send money to the Philippines from other countries using Bitcoin technology. We've been in business for a year now, have gotten a few hundred thousand dollars in investments, and have decent revenue for a year old tech startup. 
There are companies that started in 2012 or so (like Coinbase in the US) that are now worth around $400 Billion and hundreds of others in different stages of development all over the world using Bitcoin as a platform for services and products, just like the internet was used as a platform by companies like Youtube, Google, Amazon, Ebay, etc in the early 90s. 
There are a lot of people making money in the Bitcoin space today. I know some successful traders who buy and sell bitcoin for a living and make a lot of money. Then there are people who also lose money. It's like a Foreign exchange currency market.

It is a technology, and currency is the first application. 
Bitcoin is what money would look like if we invented it today instead of thousands of years ago. 
It has all the properties of gold (it is scarce and fungible) and fiat money (it is easy to transport and transfer and divide into units), yet it does all of these things in a more superior way. 
There is no central authority or company or people controlling its supply, its distribution, and its existence. This is what separates it from all other forms of currency. 
As a technology, it is almost as important as the internet itself, according to some of the brightest minds in the tech industry. If you want to save or invest a portion of your savings into Bitcoin, it is just like buying gold, silver, stocks, etc. You aren't really *spending*, you're just saving your money in a different form. 
Here's a great article from Marc Andreessen, the guy who invented the modern web browser, that talks about *[why bitcoin matters]( Fairly easy read, but well  articulated :) 
Also, here's a [short but great video about the potential of the technology behind Bitcoin.](

A miner is a person or group/company that runs Bitcoin software and uses the computing power of their mining hardware (CPU power) to collect, verify, and secure 10-minute blocks of bitcoin transactions. The miner who gets to do it first in that 10 minute time span gets to add this block to a chain of blocks going back to the first ever bitcoin transaction, which in turn gives them a reward of newly created bitcoins (12.5 BTC) plus all the transaction fees for that block. This has been going on non stop since 2009 - every 10 minutes, new blocks are added. 24/7. 
Miners are the ones writing on the bitcoin accounting ledger (blockchain) and keeping it secure/making sure the chain keeps going. This is all running on automated software. 
They get new bitcoins as a reward for this "service" they provide.

Bitcoin can be used in centralized ways. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it is open, free, and has no preference on how it is used. And people can **choose** however which way they would like to use it.
The moment you tell other people how they *should* use a technology, how *your* way is the right way, how using it a certain way is bad, well then it is no different from a government telling us what to do.

But you have fiat to exchange so yes, why bother. What if you lose your wallet, or run out of fiat, or dont want to carry large sums of fiat around but need to a large sum of pesos?
It depends on your needs really. Nobody is forcing anyone to use the service. This is about converting bitcoin to pesos, not fiat to pesos. It doesnt make sense to compare them this way.

There are no middlemen between us and our partners in Korea, so yes, we are using Bitcoin the way it was intended to be used. Just so happens that it is not our end users using it yet. 
"Be your own bank" is not going to happen anytime soon over here. Most people here in the Philippines don't even have bank accounts or any concept of proper banking. Out of 100 million people, less than 3% have credit cards. Cash is absolutely king here and in similar developing markets. 
.1% of a $30 billion market is $30 Million, and coming from doing $20,000 in our first month back in 2014, I consider that a success, yes.

If you can't see how permissionless, borderless, and uncensorable digital value transfer are a step forward in the evolution of how humans transact with each other, then it is pointless and we can agree to disagree.
The great thing about Bitcoin is it is a voluntary network and nobody is ever forced to use it. No other modern from of money has this feature. 
We are building infrastructure right now. My [startup in the Philippines]( has processed tens of millions of dollars of cheap remittances using BTC for four years now, at half the cost of the global average. We hope to make a difference using the technology that Bitcoin enables, that's all.

That isn't how markets work. A trillion dollar market cap doesn't mean there is a trillion dollars in Bitcoin. It only means that the last average price someone was willing to pay for Bitcoin at an exchnage was, say at 17M coins, was about $60,000. Market caps flow lose billions in value when only millions trade on exchanges.
That's why you see shitcoins with Billions in market cap. They don't have Billions invested in them.

No. Satoshi made laid it out there plain and simple in the main abstract of the Bitcoin white paper. Bitcoin solved a previously unsolvable problem called the double spending problem.
"We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU proof-of-worker. As long as a majority of CPU proof-of-worker is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Electronic cash SYSTEM. 
Not "a peer to peer electronic cash".
Bitcoin is not just the currency. It is the p2p network, hash-based proof-of-work, and the distributed ledger. Those three are what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin. The software actually only recognizes satoshis as a unit of account. There isn't even a real "bitcoin" unit.

Satoshi made laid it out there plain and simple in the main abstract of the Bitcoin white paper. Bitcoin solved a previously unsolvable problem called the double spending problem.
In the computer science world, it was thought impossible to have distributed consensus without a trusted third party. This is why, before Bitcoin, there has never been a successful digital value transfer mechanism that was also peer to peer.

Bitcoin has no ideals or opinions, people do. It's a technology, open source at that, meaning anyone can do whatever the hell they want with it and it isn't wrong.
Bitcoin has no core values. It is a tool. A hammer can be used to build, or can be used to destroy. HOLD speculators are as valid a bitcoin user as anti-banking ideologies. 
Last but not the least, this subreddit is not Bitcoin. It's one small window into the whole ecosystem. People can choose not to participate here, there are many forums for technical discussions and anti banking ideologies.

It's really the way the message was delivered. All of the information here was already available then, but the talk just wrapped up all up nicely and it just clicked in my head.
Back then, the market was tiny and a random Subway sandwich joint accepting Bitcoin was actually front page news. I watched China sneeze and drop the price 40% in a couple of hours. There were many criticism and not much to prop up the idea of Bitcoin except for this future vision of a decentralized financial world. There wasnt much of a startup ecosystem, no other cryptos that had any kind of real value (price) and no "blockchain" craze from financial institutions.
Today there is absolutely no doubt about the future success of cryptocurrencies and the technology behind it.

Each individual remitter goes to our on-ramp partner, gives them fiat, and then these partners send us BTC, which we convert back to fiat and deliver to the recipients. They send BTC with every transaction using a vendor partner dashboard we provide them. Sometimes they use the vendor credit option and send us a big chunk of BTC in advance, which costs the same as any btc transaction so it doesnt take days to clear and won't get held by the banks for some reason (this happens a lot). It is still cheaper because it is between us and them only, and less hassles. We can confidently pay out on our side because there is no way they can reverse the settlement.

The Philippines receives so much money in remittances every year that there are more than 10,000 pawnshops/remittance centers all over the entire country, even in the remote islands. We deliver to any of them, all the receiver has to do is show up with a valid ID and claim their cash.  We deliver to banks if they have bank accounts.

Buttcoiners are neccessary. They keep us honest, keep us grounded, and keep us motivated to prove them wrong.
These guys have gone so far as to make fake accounts similar to mine and go over my account and troll my non-bitcoin posts too. I don't really mind, as long as no lines are crossed. Pretty funny sometimes actually. I see it as parody or comedy.

It took a while for it to sink in for me, and I've been doing this for over a year now. 
The reason nobody can freeze or confiscate Bitcoin is that it is an asset/commodity/currency that isn't also someone's liability at the same time. Unlike everything else we have today, assets or even money is always under the care of a third party, be it the government, a company, or a financial institution. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:16:08
The network can only process 7-10 transactions per second because of the 1MB block size limit (I might be wrong, correct me if I am). To put that into perspective, VISA can process 4,000 transactions PER SECOND.

Great map. I'm from the Philippines, and a founder of SCI (Rebit, Bitmarket, etc) and if you guys tried reaching out to other homegrown bitcoin companies maybe you could have gotten more data.

The Bitcoin "elevator pitch". The best way to do it, and I've done it a million times, is to say Bitcoin is money 2.0, a native payment system for the internet, only possible today because of the combination of smart phone technology and widespread internet availability. 
It's a new kind of money that anyone, anywhere in the world can use without permission, anytime. 
It's like email or messaging, but instead of sending information, we can now send information with an attached value i.e. money. 
If we were given the task of inventing money TODAY, would we choose metal coins and paper sheets? Or something digital?

Look I am not trying to antagonize you in any way, in fact, I appreciate the discussion. 
Yes, Rebit.ph has been up and running for about 10 months now and is our most successful service. It is growing faster than we expected and actually faster than we can handle at times. I agree with you that international remittance is the low-hanging fruit for Bitcoin, especially for a country like ours whose GDP is 10% from remittances. 
You say "only" 39% has access to the net. That's 39 million people. The Philippines also has the fastest growing smartphone market in Asia, with 25% already owning one as of 2014 and growing fast with the advent of $30 smartphones. It is a recipe for a huge change. 
In the PH, there is a huge informal marketplace built on facebook and instagram, where people sell goods and services using those platforms. They get paid using a "pony express" method of buyers actually going to the bank and taking a photo of their deposit slip and sending this to the merchant before the sale can be consummated. 
If only there was a reliable digital currency they could use that was free to access and had no prerequisites and minimum required volumes. We're enabling this right now with  Most of our 200+ merchants are these little guys, and they get really excited when they do get a Bitcoin payment, no matter how infrequent. 
I say short sighted because we are looking at years down the road, building actual usable services that will, for now, have very few users. Yet we have this vision that down the road, Bitcoin will develop and become easier to use and gain mainstream acceptance. 
I didnt mean it in a dergatory way. I was just making an observation.

In 1986, the Philippines had what is now called the [People Power Revolution]( a bloodless revolution that toppled a ruthless dictator of 30 years. 
Not a shot was fired. People took to the streets and faced tanks and guns. The military took the side of the people, and the dictator fled. 
This is why when we started our Bitcoin startup here in the PH, we called bitcoin "The "People Power" of Money". It IS a revolution of sorts.

It is because you are very short sighted and look at Bitcoin today and think this is what it will still look like in 5 to 10 years. 
We are one company and we are already building products and services that will be very useful and wont even need to mention the word bitcoin, yet use the technology under the hood. 
We've built Rebit.ph which uses bitcoin for remittances, for example. The instant settlement of bitcoin allows us to do international transfers of previously impossible amounts like $25 from bank to bank (fiat to btc to fiat) and make it cost 1% or less to the customer.
We're working and building. It's not all rhetoric.

At least 25 different brick and mortar merchants in the capital, plus about 200 online merchants. Users? Very small group of people. Receivers of Bitcoin remittances don't even know Bitcoin was used since we convert it to cash immediately for them. 
We established the Bitcoin organization of the Philippines with the SEC, a non profit dedicated to developing the industry here.

Exchanging traditional currency electronically is very different from transmitting a unique digital unit of account with an assigned value without a clearing house, or bank, or any other third party involved.
Nobody owes anyone anything after the transaction is complete. There is no consolidation or balancing the sheets after the fact. It happens as the transaction happens, as if cash was handed from one person to another. You can't do this with regular money. 
I could be wrong, and if I am, I would welcome any corrections.

At least one study calculates the cost of fraud at [$190 Billion]( 
You have to understand where I am coming from. Living in a country like the Philippines where none of the financial luxuries you take for granted are readily available, Bitcoin presents an amazing alternative. I didnt know there were prepaid paypal cards, never heard of them and they will probably never sell them here. Online banking for free? Wow! Lucky. Here, you have to pay couple of bucks just to withdraw your own money from the same bank if it is in a different branch. Most of the time, you actually LINE UP at a bank to withdraw or deposit money.
It might sound over the top to you, but i wrote that sincerely and expressed what I felt honestly. All the payment systems you mentioned will never be accessed by 95% of the people here in my home country, yet Bitcoin can bridge that huge gap and allow anybody to use it without permission or prerequisites. 
Out of 100 million, there are less than 3 million people here with a credit card/debit card/ access to proper banking. How will they access all those services you mentioned?
This is my perspective, but I understand yours as well. It seems my enthusiam about this is something that could be hard to comprehend from your perspective, and that's fine with me.

Yes. We have been running a bitcoin startup out of the Philippines since 2014. 
So what was your point? 
The system eliminates the need to use trusted third parties. The ledger is completely verifiable and duplicable and if you decide that you don't trust it, you can check for yourself, OR, if it still doesn't satisfy you, you can leave the network anytime you want.  
Bitcoin is not only trustless, it is also voluntary. No one is ever forced to use it. A user can choose to trust the system, sure, if you want to play semantics. But the same user, if they decided to verify for themselves, is free to do so like everybody else. 
EDIT: added stuff
@_date: 2015-09-08 06:37:39
Well, I and a few other friends decided to start our own little bitcoin business around January of 2014. The result of that was [Bitmarket.ph]( From there it all just happened so fast that within a few months, we had [Rebit.ph]( and a slew of other bitcoin services like [Prepaidbitcoin.ph]( Bitstars.ph (now in hibernation mode), Bills.ninja (now absorbed into Rebit) and some other stuff we tried out. We've recently included [Buybitcoin.ph]( into the fold too.
Today we've streamlined everything and run our business as [Satoshi Citadel Industries]( The business is growing fast and so are our eye bags and white hairs ;)
The bitcoin business is not for the faint of heart!
We chose Bitcoin because we think the technology is perfect for a country like ours, The Philippines. 100 Million people, less than 10% are banked, only 3% credit card penetration, yet it is the fastest growing smartphone market in Asia (30% today, expected 50% by 2016) with $27 billion dollars in inward remittances sent to the country last year alone, plus domestic remittances from City to provinces exceeding $40 Billion annually.

They keep forgetting to add "Bitcoin", as in Bitcoin Blockchain Technology.

I have to agree with you on this. Maybe I am lucky to be on the inside and actually see what is happening in the industry from a closer point of view. There is a lot of progress in the way Bitcoin is seen by people and financial institutions  but we are far from real mainstream acceptance and adoption. I think it will take another several years to gain some real traction, unless someone comes up with a killer app (much like the web browser for the internet) that lets everyone use it effortlessly.

There is no such thing as bitcoin "the currency". Bitcoin is the name of the technology, and also the name of the value token used in the transaction network. 
 
The Blockchain is simply a bunch of bitcoin transactions formed into ten-minute blocks and added to the history of the network to prove its validity. 
There is no "blockchain technology". It's a buzzword. Bitcoin IS the technology. 
"Currency" is the first and most practical *application* of the technology.

The wild swings are because it is really early days. BTC is in the process of price discovery, and it is the first purely freely traded asset/commodity/currency that is decentralized and global. The total worth of all Bitcoins is about $35 billion *only*, compared to gold which is $8 Trillion,yet even gold has swung from $2000 to $1200 not too long ago. 
Look at Bitcoin as a technology and it suddenly makes more sense. The tokens used in the network are limited to 21 million, and the value of these tokens directly affect the amount of commerce the network can do.

Hi, I mean no disrespect but most of what you said is totally wrong. 
The byzantine general's problem asks how to achieve consensus when parties cannot be trusted. The "problem" has nothing to do with the "digital" part. 


This is so wrong. I'm not attacking you, I implore you to consider the fact that you might be wrong. Those companies are NOT an example of decentralized. They are all centralized third parties. Decentralization is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority. 
In a decentralized system, it was known to be impossible to achieve consensus. Decentralization IS the problem. Digital replication has nothing to do with it. Digital replication was NOT removed by Bitcoin. You can make as many copies of one bitcoin as you want - it is *double spending* that it eliminated - through *proof of work.*


Oh my.. No. Absolutely wrong again. Mining **creates** proof of work. Mining is the use of computing power to **prove** you did the work to find a block. The scarcity part is hard-coded in the protocol and 21 million is just an arbitrary number chosen by Satoshi.
I'm sorry, I just came across this and could not help but respond. Please try to check my answers or ask some. Crypto experts. I run one of the biggest bitcoin startups in the Philippines and have given countless talks about bitcoin to a wide audience. You are wrong.

Here's my two cents. 
Monetary Sovereignty: Bitcoin offers monetary sovereignty. It is hard to overstate the value of this. To own money free from government control (much like gold, but you can hardly use gold as money anymore) is a great value to society in general. To be able to transact with anyone, anywhere, anytime, without permission, is very valuable.
Censorship resistance: You cannot tamper with the Blockchain. It is a global shared source of truth. It's like there is a notary present in every transaction.
Borderless: There has never been a globally accepted currency/ value transfer protocol that doesn't recognize borders. 
Interoperable: Every bitcoin wallet or service in the world is interoperable. This has tremendous value. Technology is usually closed source and exclusive. Bitcoin has changed that paradigm. 
Trust Cost Minimization: The cost of trust is high. Bitcoin removes the need for trust between transacting parties, therefore creating more value for the parties involved. 
As for the price of one bitcoin compared to the US dollar, that's not "value", that's price. Price discovery is determined by the free market. The market decides how much they want to pay for one bitcoin, much like how it works for a barrel of oil, an ounce of gold, or a foreign currency. Why is gold valuable? There is actually less of a reason for it to be valuable than there is for bitcoin.

The $27 billion dollar remittance industry has attracted a thriving bitcoin industry here. There are several companies and players here that have enabled hundreds of merchants to accept Bitcoin and turned almost every bank and pawnshop into a Bitcoin ATM for cashing out.

Yes in many cases it can be more expensive that just using normal transfer methods, but there are also many examples where it is cheaper. It depends on the infrastructure and services available in the receiving end, as well as the amounts involved. 
I do agree with you though, and we have stated this before as a company - we will know we have succeeded once our service becomes obsolete, meaning people just use Bitcoin without needing to exchange to fiat.

Correct me f I am wrong but mining does not "Create" Bitcoins. Mining provides proof-of-work that makes the miner eligible to take transaction fees AND a chance to WIN the block reward, which today is 25 Bitcoins.
The system was designed to produce a block reward every ten minutes, no matter the hashing power or number of miners or whatever other factor. By design, a fixed and predetermined amount of Bitcoins are created by the system as a reward for miners. 
The miners don't create anything.

Apologies in advance for the buttcoiners who will brigade this post and call you a shill. They gotta do what they gotta do.
I am one of the founders of the Bitcoin startup behind Rebit and we're always glad to hear stories like yours. We definitely beat WU or any traditional remittance service especially with small amounts. If you could hook your family up with a basic bank account, then it would cost you 0% to send it straight into their account using Rebit. 
I'll PM you my email so you can have a direct line to us. We'd love to hear any feedback or suggestions. Cheers mate!
Edit: It would cost you 0% on the our side, but still cost you 2% on the Aus side from the purchase of BTC. Still saves you more than 50% in fees though :)

Well, I worked right beside the author for the last 18 months so I kind of know what he is talking about. Everything he said is true, but it talks about Bitcoin as it exists today and not what it can be, and we believe will scale to become, when the time is right. We are currently piggybacking on the existing infrastructure so that we can grow. It works, but it could be better.
We've always known from the beginning (and I can be quoted on this) that our ultimate goal with Rebit is to make ourselves obsolete, preferable by our own selves as well. We're busy building the next stage of what we believe the future of bitcoin remittance will be, and none of it involves kiosks or cash reserves or anything that resembles a western union.
I do disagree with the blanket statement but I think it was more of a catchy title to get readers :) people DO find it cheaper, and it is why we have grown 100-fold in the last 18 months.

Also, the Philippines has a unique infrastructure for local remittance: over 10 million Filipinos (out of the 100 million population) work abroad. They send home $27 Billion a year. Because of this, there are companies that do nothing but serve as cash pickup centers / pawnshops, and number in the tens of thousands. 
[You literally cannot see the Philippine land mass on google maps just by checking out ONE BRAND of pawnshop/remittance center.]( And there are 3 major competing brands nationwide. 
There are literally more places to pickup your cash in the entire 7,100 islands that make up the Philippines than there are banks, ATMs, even convenience stores, or anything else. They are *EVERYWHERE*. We use this network to payout to anyone, even those without a bank account.

Hi, I'm from Rebit.ph, Bitspark's off-ramp partner in the Philippines. What they do is basically offer a cheaper remittance service alternative to customers (in our case, Filipino migrant workers) and use Bitcoin to settle with us over at Rebit in the Philippines, where we instantly convert the BTC to Pesos and deliver the money either via bank deposit or cash pickup centers. 
Turnaround time is usually within a couple of hours, and they can send amounts as small as $22 at a time and not get raped by fees.

Why not? This is a service that can potentially save remitters *Billions* of dollars annually, and it works *right now*, even with Bitcoin in its infancy. Bitcoin has 3 million users, tops, and is so volatile that it loses as much as 20% in a day or more. We need more time for it to be really viable as a daily currency. 


Agree 100%. But the reality is, that's  several years down the line. We like to say as a company that the day we know we are successful is the day we become obsolete. 


Agree again, 100%. This is why out startup not only established Rebit.ph, we also own and operate [the Bitpay of the Philippines]( with 250 merchants and counting, a [Bills payment service]( a [Prepaid Bitcoin card service]( and even the first [Bitcoin Order book exchange]( in the PH. 


We actually envision and are working on this, but it takes a lot of time and effort. I think it will take at least five years or so to have any decent penetration in a market like the Philippines where only 3% of the 100 million population use credit cards or have a bank account. 
Right now, people will find services like Rebit useful. Bitcoin in and of itself is not useful to your average Filipino who earns $12 a day to support a family of four. 
But I get what you are saying too, and agree with you on those points.
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:11:54

Yeah, I was being polite and he accused us of being scammers. Kind of got to me, because we take pride in the work we do and the services we provide. And he is so hilariously clueless about what he is talking about that I thought maybe if he saw that many people told him he was actually wrong, he might learn something. Sadly, the guy believes in alternative facts so yeah, kinda hopeless.

Seems like we think alike! That's actually what we are working on right now as we speak, not just for Australia, but for every major corridor for remittance to the PH. 
If you were not already aware, we are employing that strategy with the Hong Kong -&gt; PH market with Bitspark.io, with them as the on-ramp and us handling the off-ramp for fiat. We basically use Bitcoin purely as a value transfer protocol and the receiver (and in cases like HK, even the sender) doesn't even have to know anything about Bitcoin. The service doesn't even have to be owned by us or formally partner with us- they can provide the on-ramp and use Rebit as an off-ramp as it is. We even provide them with vendor tools and their own dashboard to make it easy, as well as a robust API to work with.
We have been communicating with some Australian Bitcoin companies and are working on it. I'll make sure to update you on those developments. Cheers!

@_date: 2015-02-04 00:42:55
Hi! One of the founders of Rebit here. Thank you for the kind words. we absolutely appreciate feedback like this :)
If you ever run into any problems with the service, PM me anytime. Cheers!

The pawnshops are literally everywhere in the Philippines. They look like little convenience stores usually with a western union or other money remittance services plus bills payment and the like. You will just need a valid ID (passport etc) and input your exact name as it appears on the ID when you fill out your Rebit.
If you're going to Boracay (beautiful place!) I suggest you choose the Palawan Pawnshop payout option in the Rebit site. Checking it out now, $1000 usd on Rebit will get you P44,186 and have a fee of P380 or ~0.9%. That's it. 
The Palawan Pawnshop branch can be found right smack in the middle of the island in a [popular place called D'Mall.]( You can't miss that area, you'll probably eat there and buy stuff there too. In case something goes wrong and Palawan Pawnshop isnt open, the other options also have branches in the island as well.
I'll sens you a PM and give you my email address just in case. Cheers!
EDIT: $1000 will cost 4.38310000 BTC in Rebit as of this writing.

Yep, as soon as I read his comment I sold everything ive been holding since 2013. Closed my 5 year old bitcoin remittance startup and told 50 employees to go home, and returned the crypto exchange license given by our central bank. Told the bitcoin and blockchain associations in the Philippines to pack up. Told Unionbank to return the bitcoin ATM they just lainched. Called Fidelity and told them to stop their bitcoin offering, called HTC to tell them to stop making their next phone bitcoin compatible, called CME to stop offering bitcoin futures. Called Jack Dorsey to shut down Cash App and Square Crypto. probably many more i forget but yeah, we are dead.
I mean, it is game over.
Oh wait, it's 2019? LOL. Thought it was 2014, coz this is the same shit from back then. Funny thing is, everyone who says bitcoin is dead will die first, bitcoin will outlive them all.

Most merchants wil not accept bitcoin unless you guarantee them instant exchange to fiat. That's the reality right now. They have bills and overhead amd salaries and costs that need fiat. The volatility of bitcoin makes it bad to hold for most businesses. 
this is why we need to close the loop.

1 BTC at $4000 is more the annual minimum wage in the Philippines. Three years before that, at $300, it was the monthly wage. When I started in 2013, 1 BTC was only $30. 
The next three years will be very interesting indeed.

Sure, virtual shops. But you can also buy and sell peer to peer online. A lot of ecommerce here in the Philippines happens through Facebook or Instagram P2P because of the lack of credit card access.

He actually said that it demystified a lot of things, making eveything more accessible, more connected even. They had no idea what was in store, but you can see that it absolutely excited (and terrified) him to have this tool or technology that will change everything we knew about transfering information/messages and media.
The internet connects and also polarizes. It's the best of both worlds. That's the beauty of it.

Why not 200 BTC? 
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:42:22
Absolutely. When $1K came, Bitcoin was $15 at the start of that year. It was too insane. After it crashed, we were thinking 10k was coming... in 2021 earliest, and that was a pipe dream. By 2016 Bitcoin was still around $400-ish. 2017, $10K?! No way.
But here we are, with a $3K "bottom". Everyone is expecting something big after the halving, but I am sure Bitcoin will surprise us once again.

It is a slot in a ledger. The private key is what you own, to access the ledger. To be able to transfer ownership to another party, you need to be able to use this key. 
Fiat works kind of the same way. The paper sheets or metal coins are just certificates/ promissory notes for the government's ledger on who owes what to who, for the ultimate end of paying it back to the government via taxes. This is why we have receipts and records of everything we do with fiat (ideally) and anything  unreported or hidden is considered illegal. It's all just a giant ledger.

The service is  We have a license from our central bank to use bitcoin as a money-transfer mechanism and in effect allowing us to exchange BTC to fiat. Most of our clients are B2B, with a smaller % being regular users sending money to people via BTC (the recipient gets Philippine pesos).
WU has so much dominance in remittances that their market share is bigger than all the others combined. Their physical presence is unmatched. Other remittance companies hate WU even. I think theyll only be threatened if facebook or other mainstream digital messaging apps start going for it hard.
The startup is Satoshi Citadel Industries or  There are several other startups competing with us too.

I am from Manila Philippines and yes, there are very few of actively into bitcoins here, but we are certainly moving in the right direction. Filipino overseas worker's remittances exceed $15 BILLION a year if I remember correctly.

I can't wait to see Bitcoin take over western union and moneygram over here.

There was no such thing as a "blockchain". Blocks of Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically chained in sequence as an immutable record of the history of all transactions in the network. Satoshi invented Bitcoin, the block chain is just one part of it.
Contrary to all the "what is blockchain" videos, it is not the underlying technology behind Bitcoin - It is a by-product of the Bitcoin protocol.

The most common question people ask would be: What is the "value" of bitcoin? It seems like it isn't "real". Why does it have a price like it does? It doesn't "exist".

It isn't going to "replace the dollar." 
First of all, the dollar is only worth something in the USA. Go to a foreign country and no store will accept your dollars, they are worthless to them. You have to go to an exchange, and change up your dollars to the local currency. 
Also, the federal reserve note not backed by gold is less than 50 years old. Money itself is thousands of years old, and bitcoin IS a kind of money. So the concept that backs bitcoin as money is the same one that backs dollars or gold as "money". 
Back to my point. For bitcoin to be successful, it only needs to get a small slice of the share of the [50 trillion dollars]( worth  economy of the world. 
If bitcoin can get 2% of this market, meaning have a market capitalization of $1 Trillion dollars, each bitcoin will be worth $100,000 more or less.

We are witnessing the BIRTH of a technology that the world has never seen before. Infrastructue will be shit for now as people get better at it. It will be clunky, slow, inefficient. 
Remember dial-up internet? When someone called your house, you lost your connection. Ten minutes to load a page more? $2/ hour charge internet shops, so you can chat on mIRC or chatropolis? How about being scammed on email before spam protection? Holy shit phisihing sites were all over the place. NOBODY wanted to put their real name or information to buy anything online out of fear. It took years to take off. In 1998, an uncle of mine wanted to GIVE my brother a Nokia 5110 Cell Phone as a gift, and my brother said "who the hell needs a celphone? i have my pager."
This thing is still in the womb, we are just feeling it kicking inside. When the water breaks, and the baby comes out big and healthy, THEN we will know. This will happen IF or when mainstream acceptance comes and the infrastructure becomes more seamless, so that even grandma can use it. Hopefully sooner than later, but it will happen. 
It will take time. 19 years ago, in 1994, Katie Couric and couple of other guys on [NBC's Today Show]( asked, "What IS this "internet" anyway?" Yet today, 19 years later, we cannot even imagine life without the internet, the smartphone, and everything else "that wasn't gonna work", like this "expert" [Clifford Stoll]( predicted.

What's worth it? Buying bitcoin to make a quick buck? Or as a long term investment? Or to be part of a revolutionary new technology?
Do you have savings in a bank? Is it "worth it" with the non-existent interest rates and high inflation?
To answer your question, in my opinion it is absolutely worth it to be a part of this whole thing. Bitcoin is not just some kind of thing you buy and then crossing your fingers hoping it doesnt crash and hoping it goes up in value. 
It's goal is to be a part of our everyday lives in the role of currency, a store of value, a means of exchange, and a technology that has the potential to change and shift the power of money back to the people instead of a select few. Freedom to transact with anyone, anywhere in the world, any time, with no middleman. 
Who wouldn't want to be part of that? :)

There are risks though. On friday, I stupidly did a small transaction for .51 BTC and the guy gave me a sweet deal (supposedly only worth .45) so I took his word and got his full name and bank details to deposit the cash. As soon as I made the the deposit and he confirmed, the last I heard from him was "Ok, transferring the BTC in a minute..." and then his numbers could not be reached anymore. And this was right when banks were about to close. Until now, he's gone. 
Be careful and never accept it when they can't escrow the bitcoin.

Over-under is used when betting on a number, like "over-under three days on hitting $1254." One picks over, one picks under.
You're asking for the odds on something happening, like "it pops after it hits $1254."I don't know the odds but I'd take a friendly bet on 1:1 odds that bitcoin will keep rising after it passes $1254. You can bet against.

Meanwhile, in Italy: 


“In Italy the purchase, use and acceptance of virtual currency must be considered lawful activity: the parties are free to transact in amounts not expressed in legal tender.”
The January 30 Notice on virtual currencies also contains an analysis of the guidance published by the EBA, and agrees with the EBA’s recommendation that financial institutions should avoid buying or investing in virtual currencies until a formal legal framework has been established. This means the Central Bank will not ban regulated institutions from dealing in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, but advises them to wait until formal regulations are announced.
The Notice allows financial institutions regulated by the Bank of Italy to do business with any virtual currency companies, provided that they respect existing AML/KYC requirements for account holders and warn them about the risks involved.

Satoshi Nakamoto actually did not invent anything new, as all the pieces have been lying around for years and years before his paper, yet nobody has been able to solve the puzzle the eay he did. Double spending, the need for a third party, etc. Cryptopurrency has been around longer, but the **blockchain** IS the innovation. 
Tell me, what has the world seen before that can be compared to bitcoin and the blockchain? Give me an example of pre-2008 electronic cash system that is 100% peer-to-peer with no trusted third party.

That has actually been part of our roadmap from the beginning.
We call it "Targeted Remittance". There is a real problem of misappropriation of funds coming from remittances, where instead of using it for intended purposes, it goes to alcohol, gambling, a mistress, etc. Ideally, with Bitcoin, it will be really easy to just pay for all the utilities and necessities from anywhere in the world, anytime. You only need to send the needed amount of actual cash, and even do it in real time as it is needed. 
Just today, with Rebit, we just turned on our Bills payment and Cellphone credits options. You can now pay for any kind of bill in the Philippines and load credit on your any mobile phone provider using bitcoin.

How can it be inflationary when it increases in value the more people buy and use it? One of bitcoin's most basic properties is that it is deflationary. 
They can print 100 trillion dollars if they wanted to. They even talked about making a trillion dollar coin to "save" the US economy from collapsing. You can't make more than 21 million bitcoins.

Since you keep saying imagine, then I can use your logic and say "Imagine if WalMart accepted bitcoins, and their suppliers accepted bitcoins as well, and they only needed to "cash out" partially for taxation purposes. Or since we are just imagining things, why not say "Imagine the government accepted bitcoinas payment for taxes?"
Imagine Walmart cashing out 10 billion, and then imagine market support for 10 Billion is there, with millions of people buying the available bitcoin, since bitcoin is so scarce?

Yes but I think the beauty of BTC is that it can evolve, and will evolve. Whatever the competition comes up with, BTC can adapt. It isn't one entity that can fail. For it to fail, everyone involved has to be a part of the failure. It's success is the same, and it is in the best interest of everyone involved to make it succeed.
But yes I agree with you that the bitcoin we see now and the cryptocurrency of the future (which i believe will still be dominated by BTC) will be like comparing an old car-plugged mobile phone that weighs 10lbs to today's newest smartphones.

Bitcoin is evolving. As fas as I know, we are in Bitcoin version 0.9. If there is a unanimous consensus among the miners to make a change to bitcoin for the better, then it will be implemented and we will have Bitcoin 1.0. As time goes by, we will see changes and most probably for the better, since no change can occur unless everyone agrees to it. If "something better" comes out, Bitcoin, I believe due to its being open-source and adaptable, will just adjust and improve as well, making it well ahead of any "new" competition. It will take a major flaw in the Bitcoin protocol to get people to move to another cryptocurrency.

You can buy $1.00 worth of bitcoin, which is 1 mBTC. Buy what you can afford comfortably. If you want to buy gold, you're not required to buy one whole bar right? Same logic.
Put it this way, if you have $500 under your matress, the value of that money decreases over time. If you buy $500 worth of bitcoin (528.7 mBTC) right now, it can potentially double, triple, quadruple in value over time. For bitcoin to be a viable worldwide currency, it needs to be worth 100 times what it is today, and based on what is happening now, that is actually a likely scenario if adoption rates of its use goes well.

The comparison says that you can't look at the technology in its infancy and say "Yes! This is the future!" because there is so much room to grow and change and evolve into what it will be, say, 10 years from now. 
Right now it is clunky, clumsy, and hard to explain. An average person will get confused, just like I couldn't really use computers in high school until windows came out. The thing is, this time, the adoption rate will be much faster. Ease of use will come in 1-2 years instead of a decade. Looking at bitcoin NOW, of course you can make a case against it. 
I'm talking about supporting it now because I believe it will be part of the future of our society, cryptocurrency. It is actually almost 5 years old, so it took half a decade of growing oains and obscurity to reach this point. Give it another 5 years, and then we can actually have better conversation. Right now it is an *emerging* technology, the blockchain and it's uses have barely been tapped. 
All bitcoin needs to do is get 1.5% of the world's $70 TRILLION economy, and it will be worth $100,000 each. That's a little over a trillion dollar market cap. Right now we are 13% on the way there. Bitcoin only need to be ten times better than it is today to reach this. It isnt some pipe dream, it is very very possible.
Only time will tell though. My position is, I can sit and watch this, or participate actively. I want to be part of it. At worse I will lose some money that I can actually live without but  I will gain knowledge and experience, or it will succeed and I'll succeed along with it.

Just because it is not a corporation it doesn't mean it won't have value. We can imagine it to be "autonomous, unmanned corporation" but why limit ourselves to that frame of mind? I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that, but the truth is, we cannot classify it yet because it is the first time we have seen anything like it. One thing is for sure, it is not a company or one entity, and it would be confusing to classify it as such.
The [Wedbush research paper]( on Bitcoin defines it quite well: 
-As a disruptive payment network technology
-**An alternative, uncorrelated asset class.**
-A safe haven currency.
I put the emphasis on the second one because it shows that right now, it is hard to define under which asset class it belongs. It might actually belong to a class of its own.

I'm sure you know that there are dozens of other "coins" out there right now that have all these properties you just listed. The cryptocurrency market cap is about $12B, and almost $11B is BTC, the rest of these "easier, faster, etc" coins share the remaining amount. 
Why isn't everyone moving to Litecoin? It's easier to mine, it will have 87 millioninstead of 21, etc etc. the reason is because it has no inherent advantage over bitcoin.

"Does not recover" from what, exactly? 
Do you know what happened in April 2013? And what happened in 2012? And 2011? Look at the 30-day chart and then the 6-month chart, and then the 2 year chart, and then compare it to the chart you showed.
Bitcoin crashed so hard so many times in the last 3 years, yet here we are. 30 days ago I was buying bitcoin at $253. That was exactly one month ago, Nov.6. Now we dip below 1,000 for a few days and we are breaking "trends"? 
Three weeks ago me and my friends were dreaming about the $1000 bitcoin party for 2014. Yet here we are.
My answer is that this has no implications for the long term, and my thoughts are that There is no such as "bitcoin closes" because it is open 24/7.
Two major down days in a row? How about two years down in a row?

Points taken. I'm new to this and only started buying at $250, which was about 3 weeks ago or less. I try to learn as much as I can everyday and discussions like this help a lot.
As with keeping all the bitcoins in one wallet, I'm guilty, but only up until tomorrow when I transfer most of them to cold storage, after buying a few more.
Needless to say, I am an optimist regarding bitcoin and I see the potential and the elegance of the actual technology but I also understand that the "craze" that is going on right now has a lot of negative implications as well.

You just can't tell people to keep their money *anywhere*. People will put their money where they want it. Pretty sad interest rates on savings accounts for the average guy, and if you keep your money under your matress, it just loses its value more and more each day. Money can be lost to a stock market crash, a bank run, a bank robbery, a theft, etc. 
Yes it has a lot of fundamental flaws today. Give it time. E-commerce and even email used to be unsafe in the early days when people did not know what malware was or how to use proper safety measures against all kinds of malicious individuals.

There are 30+ other crypto currencies today. SEXcoin is one of them. Start buying! 
Kidding aside, some offer different services, some offer unique services, some try to be like bitcoin, but they ALL come from the same source, the open source software that is the original bitcoin. Competition is good. Bitcoin does not have to be the ONLY currency to be succesful. If BTC can get even only 1/6th of the market capitalization of gold, it will already be worth $100,000 EACH.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:51:28
What is the basis of your conclusion that "a new coin can get popular really fast?" Maybe give examples of these better features? Easier mining is already here, Litecoin is easier to mine and so is every other crypto currency out there, and there are around 30 of them. Wy is this an advantage over bitcoin? Can you elaborate?
Bitcoin, as it is now, was at least four years in the making, plus more years of trial and error before it was pieced together so elegantly by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is also open source software, and we are in bitcoin 0.9 right now. We haven't even seen bitcoin 1.0. Thing thing evolves, and is evolving as we speak. it won't be sleeping when a new competitor shows up. Right now it is so ahead of the pack that it is highly unlikely that something will take over in the near future.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:51:04
Yes, localbitcoins.com! You can buy in small amounts. I barely had $3,000 to my name just like you but I have a good steady income, and in Nov.6 I trusted my gut and a friend who already owned 45 btc from buying since march, and bought my first 1.4 Btc,(at $250)  and then 09 btc, .45 btc, and several more times, in different increments and different prices.
You can start of even with just $1! You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin. Buy mBTC, which is about a dollar each.
What I did was I set a target amount in dollars (say 2,000) that I was willing to put in over a set amount of time. Being very optimistic at the time (1 bitcoin was $253) I envisioned this amount to become multiplied by 10, and I would have been extremely happy. Less than a month later, my X amount has more than doubled and I am STILL buying bitcoins in small increments with what I can soare even at these prices.

@_date: 2013-11-25 16:05:13
They're **mining** bitcoins, not creating money. It requires time and effort, a lot of energy as well. What the value will be is out of their control. Miners are actually having a hard time making a profit. The rate of block creation is approximately constant over time and halves every four years, plus increases in difficulty to keep the pace the same. 
On the other hand, the federal government actually considered creating a **Trillion dollar coin** to bail the US out of its economic disaster. Out of nothing, they can print a trillion dollars in one day. They can print money as much as they want as long as they want.

I think the exchanges can handle that.

Well, according to your previous posts, you said you're hoping for crash because you have 0.8-ish bitcoin. You keep some of the 0.8 in a few paper wallets? 
Thanks for admitting your analogy was "not ideal". Saying that if you memorize your email address and password means you have a "brain inbox" does not make any sense at all. I wasnt trying to make a rebuttal, I was merely stating a fact. AND please don't say ad hominem or whatever, because i said it *sounds* stupid, and not attacking you as a person. 
I stand by how I understand it, and I am not an expert and only have a few (a little more than 10) bitcoins myself. By creating an offline wallet/ brain wallet, the bitcoin now exists *outside* the network. Maybe that's too basic and you can argue on technicalities but for all intents and purposes, yes I think it means you are storing it in a way that it does not exist in the network until you decide to use it again.

Yeah. I never said I think that way. 
The market cap of gold is $8 trillion. The world economy is about $70 trillion. Bitcoin can get 1% of this and be worth more than $50,000. It will never replace the USD, or the euro, or gold. It only need to get a nice little chunk of that market to be worth a lot lot more.

It's a stretch for me too, but I believe the rewards far outweigh the risks at this point! I dropped in at $240 per btc using some money I saved on the side, and that money, instead of sitting in the bank earning next to nothing has grown to be worth $350 per btc in such a short span of time. So im trickling in whatever funds I can slowly but surely! At any price right now, it is still early!

Ok. If you want to send someone a reddit tip, you must have a bitcoin wallet on reddit. When you accepted the tip I gave you, you automatically have a reddit wallet address that you will see in one of your message in your inbox from the bitcointip bot.
Fund that address by sending money from your wallet from, say, blockchain.onfo or coinbase, and send money to the reddit wallet address. Once that wallet is funded, you can tip as much as you want from there by replying DIRECTLY to the person you want to give a tip to this EXACTLY this way ---&gt; **+(amount of bitcoin) verify** by typing verify, you will receive a message that verifies the tip to the public.
I hope that helped. Feel free to ask if you still need help.
EDIT: I just have to add that after you use the reddit tip, you cant use it again right away. It has an anti-spam filter and will ignore your next tips if you do it too fast.

Hey man, Pinoy here. I live in Manila. I have been scammed once in localbitcoins by user Mrayblitz. It was a small amount, but I was stupid and did not use the escrow service that localbitcoins provide. I trusted him and deposited money and poof he was gone. Trusted and good sellers are Ctan, Mangsweeney, and Runar. 
Use the ESCROW service! You place an order, localbitcoins hold on to the BTC for you, and will not release it until the trade is confirmed by both parties. Also, try the Bitcoin PH facebook page, there ae sellers there but for smaller amounts. 
Make sure you use escrow, that's the best advice I can give.

You can withdraw the bitcoins here to your other wallets which exists say, in coinbase, or blockchain.info, or other sites that offer wallet services. It is as simple as sending an email, but you are sending **actual money**. 
People tip others for excellents posts, great comments, funny stuff, or to give to charity, or to buy someone a beer! Like this! 
+1 beer verify
Your next beer should be on me :) remember, I'm from the Philippines. and I'm buying you a beer. This is just a small demonstration of the power of bitcoin!
Now Imagine this for remittances, for money transfers, for wiring money to other countries. I sent you a few dollars, but I can send a million dollars (if i had it!) *in the exact same way!*
I watched your show today and am looking forward to seeing you learn and understand this technology, this innovation. I am sure you will learn to appreciate it as much as we do, and can imagine a world where this actually works. It is clunky and messy and complicated right now, just like the internet was in 1993. We will outgrow this stage very fast as people have a very sharp adoption curve for new tech nowadays.
Good luck and I will be watching your show with eager anticipation! Good on you for reaching out to reddit and getting your feet wet here.
My name is Miguel, just so you know. I am a real person, from across the world. ;)
EDIT: I think the bitcointip bot's spamming defense worked because i just gave you a tip, and then gave you another one here. Let me try again ok? Let know if you get it!

I can agree with your statement, but we are talking about only the next 3-5 years, and bitcoin has gained so much momentum that it will be hard to unseat as THE world's digital currency for maybe a little while. Remember, it isn't the Bitcoin itself that is valuable, it is the blockchain that is what makes it a game-changer.
And yes those things I said are "ifs" and conservatively optimistic.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:49:12
1% of the world's wealth captured by bitcoin would make it have a market capitalization of $700 billion. Not just as currency, but as a store of value and many other things the bitcoin protocol is capable of being and doing. 
$700 billion would make it worth 70 times more what it is worth today. So that comes out to about $63,000 per BTC. 
Highly unlikely in the very near future but not impossible in say, the next 10-20 years.

Talk about foresight! He got into a heated argument with someone who said that bitcoins are used by non-productive members of society and for illegal activites. This was his response.


Eventually productive members of society will just reject your rules and stop accepting your bullshit money.
Oh sure, you can try to coerce us back into participation through violence. You can send your jackbooted thugs after us to collect your legally mandated "share" of our labor. But that only works for so long before we want freedom so badly we will fucking kill you in self defense. That's called a revolution, and it's starting.
Bitcoin allows men to simply work, to transact with whomever we please on whatever terms we choose, and to save the product of our labor. Nobody can take it by debasement or by seizing it through taxation. It's over for you, and your hegemony, and your tyranny. Your cherished bankers and legislators, your currency, your rules and regulations... it is all over for you. DIAF, statist.

I love that they are relatively inexpensive but still awesome, and way better than drinking cheap beer or rum any time. Best one I have had so far was when a friend coming from abroad brought home a bottle of Macallan 25. Maybe i'll have some scotch tonight, it is Friday here after all :)

Technically yes.Some print it on aluminum plates. The most amazing thing about bitcoin is that you can store it SOLELY in your brain, if you can memorize all the necessary data. It is called a [Brain Wallet](
"A brainwallet refers to the concept of storing Bitcoins in one's own mind by memorization of a passphrase. As long as the passphrase is not recorded anywhere, the Bitcoins can be thought of as existing nowhere except in the mind of the holder. If a brainwallet is forgotten or the person dies or is permanently incapacitated, the Bitcoins are lost forever."
THAT is kind of mind-blowing for me. The bitcoin does notexist anywhere else, online or offline, except in your brain!
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:31:46
Haha! Well, if they're worth a million, that's a $10,000 tip right there! 
But seriously, that's how easy it is to start. You don't HAVE to buy "one bitcoin". Now, quite possibly watch that dollar turn into 2, 3, or more in the near future. A dollar equivalent now that can possibly have more purchasing power in the near future because it isn't a dollar anymore. 
This isn't something you "join" like a club. It's simply something you'll (possibly) be using in your daily life in the coming years. I'm a believer, obviously, and yes I do think that because that dollar will be worth more (even just double that), that is a powerful thing. Your Dollar in your wallet will NEVER double in value.

Seriously? Knowing someone will pay $839 for something, but you can buy it for $1, you would say no? That does not make any logical sense at all.
Also, why would I sell you a bitcoin (or anything else for that matter) if it was worth nothing to you? A dollar is worthless in a country that does not accept dollars, you will still have to go to a money changer and exchange it for whatever they use as currency. Does that mean your dollars are worthless? Anything is "worth" only what another person is willing to pay for it.

If only one person had 1 BTC each and it was worth 1 Million, then that means there will be 21 million new millionaires in the world. But this is not the case, because the number of actual owners of 1 BTC or more are estimated in the hundreds of thousands (correct me if I am wrong). 
Today, there is an estimated number of 12 million people who have at least $1 million in the world. Not a lot but it is at an all time high. If a million bitcoin owners with 1 btc or more become millionaires, it isnt as big as it seems compared to the global economy.

The people who want your bitcoin won't be the ones to deserve it. If a person wants to truly give, they give without conditions or expectation. This is why you are not really "giving" anything. You are putting a carrot on a stick and making people do things you want them to do for your own selfish reasons. 
When I say "selfish"' it does not mean anything negative. We are all selfish. Even those who give their entire being to the service of others get satisfaction and fulfillment for their actions. We do things because it serves us a purpose. 
Now there are people who do this unconsciously, and there are people who do this with purpose. Most people *react*, few people *create*. you are trying to make people react to your "carrot" of one bitcoin, and they do. 
I wouldn't want to receive your so called gift. Money is nothing. It's a concept that all our lives we were taught was a requirement for happiness. As a result, most people's lives are spent chasing something they don't even understand. 
Just keep your bitcoin. Seriously, use it for something you think is good. Stop using it as a tool to control others.

Guys, don't bother going to the site, he probably just wants the reddit traffic on his obscure blog.
"You don't have a choice, and it simply does not matter what some liberal college professor taught you in your state sanctioned economics curriculum. Eventually productive members of society will just reject your rules and stop accepting your bullshit money. 
Oh sure, you can try to coerce us back into participation through violence. You can send your jackbooted thugs after us to collect your legally mandated "share" of our labor. But that only works for so long before we want freedom so badly we will fucking kill you in self defense. That's called a revolution, and it's starting. 
Bitcoin allows men to simply work, to transact with whomever we please on whatever terms we choose, and to save the product of our labor. Nobody can take it by debasement or by seizing it through taxation. It's over for you, and your hegemony, and your tyranny. Your cherished bankers and legislators, your currency, your rules and regulations... it is all over for you. DIAF, statist." - from the Reddit user who sold all his gold for 13,500 bitcoins in 2012.

I never even entertained the idea of brain wallets, because basically I was told to stay away from them, and this post actually confused me. I understand that the passphrase was "guessed" and upon checking, he can see how many coins are in there... But how why does he have access to it? No other passwords or authentication needed? I thought brain wallets were suppsoed to be "off the network" so it can't be stolen?

I guess Berlin is a huge city and it is only in the [Kreuzberg District]( where bitcoin is widely accepted, according to this article on a couple who traveled for 100 days around the world relying solely on bitcoin. 
I get where you are coming from and everything you are saying are based on current facts. But surely you have to also admit that there is a good possibility that it can become mainstream, like a lot of people like Ben Bernanke or Richard Branson believe it will. 
You don't see a future where bitcoin could possibly be an alternative form of payment all over the world? 
I guess only time will tell if we are right or wrong :)

He is basically saying it is primarily used for illegal activities, and it's worth is tied to chinese money laundering. He is still bashing bitcoin, but safely making it look like he didn't, so he has deniability when he is proven wrong. What a coward. 
A sample of his crap:
"The same argument applies to the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin. If I'm buying weed online, what do I care if others are hoarding it, or if the price has gone up five times in the last day? So long as at the current price, the seller and me are able to come to a mutually agreeable price when translated back into U.S. dollars, the price rise just isn't that big of an impediment. In fact, the price rise might actually be helpful (more on this later).
"Even if you don't think drugs, online gambling, and other illegal activity is enough to sustain a "currency," the same principle applied above could apply to something more important: money laundering or circumventing capital controls."

If it was MY OWN $10,000, I'd easily go for it. Sadly, I have only been able to put in $2,000 of my own (which has almost tripled in the last few weeks!) I believe in bitcoin's potential 100%, but I will never tell someone else to put their money in based only on what they heard from me, especially if their goal is an easy "double up" on their investment. 
That being said, I'll have about $10k in it before the year ends, a comfortably small amount for me and big enough so that if it reaches even 10% of the heights the optimists say, I'll be happily enjoying the profits!

You're wrong. Haven't you heard of cold storage or offline wallets? You are essentially taking your bitcoin data out of the network. The blockchain is a record of **transactions** of bitcoin, not a storage for bitcoins.  
[In plain english.]( A “cold” storage system is powered-down, stopped, **offline**. To this end what we really mean when we say “cold storage” is that we’re storing Bitcoins somewhere that’s **not connected to the Bitcoin network or, in most cases, even connected to the internet or even on a computer at all.**
I'm no expert, but comparing your bitcoin wallet to you emaiil address is kind of stupid. "Brain inbox"? LOL.
Bitcoins can exist **offline**, or in others words, NOT in the network.

No. 
And here's a good [link]( on why. 
And by the time we have quantum computers, bitcoin should have exploded into the mainstream by then. I'm pretty sure there won't be any functional mainstream quantum computers for your everyday household in the next five, ten , or twenty years.

It "only" needs to climb 100x to reach $100k. $1 Trillion+ market cap. The world economy is about 70 trillion. Bitcoin "Only" needs to take less than 1.5% of that to reach $1 trillion. Highly unlikely in the near near future, but not as impossible as it seems. Right now, there 7 million existing wallets. 001% of the world. This is a tiny tiny economy/industry right now but the potential is enormous in all aspects of society. 
I say it is possible for bitcoin to grow 100x more and not a delusion. 
I could be wrong, but only time will tell!

I agree with most of what you said, except the time frame. The internet as we know it took 20 years to reach this point where people who lose their internet connection for a few hours go nuts. Most people can't imagine life without a smartphone, yet the iPhone is only SIX years old. 
Right now you are correct, bitcoin is not "there" yet, but these steps it is taking are in the right direction. It is too early and there are many factors that can contribute to either its downfall or triumph, but I really do not believe it will take 20 to 30 years. Technological advancement is growing faster and faster, and so will adoption of new technology as well. 
I say five years from now, we will know for certain if cryptocurrency is here to stay. And dare I say not two years from now, the adoption of bitcoin will be ten-fold of what it is today. But that's just me :)

Nobody knows what's gonna happen! That's what makes it exciting :) 
But some people can be reasonably and confidently certain about an outcome based on the information at hand, be it a positive outcome or a negative one. I believe personally that bitcoin is going to be a real game-changer, much like how the internet changed communication and commerce all over the world. 
Several thousand early adopters became millionaires, and a lot of people also lost out on the dotcom bubble, but today, everyone is benefiting from the internet even down to the average guy who never "made money" from it but uses it to communicate with friends and family worldwide instantly.
I believe there will be winners and losers in the world of cryptocurrency but the long long term outlook is that the benefits of this technology will go well beyond "profits". Seamless peer to peer transactions using the internet without the need of a third party is an idea whose time has come, and we are witnessing its birth! 
**TL;DR** To the Moon! (or potato!)

That would be great! You can check out the facebook page for updates. if you do want to send the BTC, you can just send it here on reddit and I will exchange it to cash right away for my friend's cause. What do you choose to name your boat? 
As of now, I believe over 101 boats have been pledged and they have started building them. The exact amount is actually 5,000 pesos, which is about $115 USD, so it would be .115 btc at todays exchange.  
Thank you so much. This act of kindness and generosity will be a gift that will keep giving and will change one family's life for the better.
Do you know the story of the man throwing stranded starfish back into the ocean? Thousands of starfish were washed ashore and one man was walking down the beach, throwing them back one at a time. Another man said "Why are you throwing them back? There are too many of them. You cannot possibly make a difference!" to which the other man replied, as he threw another starfish back into the water,
"I made a difference to *that one.*"
