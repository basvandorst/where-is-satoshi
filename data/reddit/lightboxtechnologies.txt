Shipping to canada from bitcoinstore is crazy too, and varies by the day. Last time I checked my cart ($2200) they wanted $1400 for shipping. The same items in the same cart to the same address was $440 shipping a week earlier. I think their shipping module is busted for anything outside USA

No, as suggested its best to get your own wallet, either an online "e-wallet" or your own local wallet (bitcoin.org).
Once you have a wallet address, go to  and fill out the BUY form, entering your wallet address to send the coins to, and your email address.  When you complete teh form it will email you instructions on how to deposit cash at a td branch (it will give you our branch/account numbers and account holder details).  Once you deposit the cash, we will send the coins directly to your wallet.  Once you have them in your wallet, you can send exactly the amount the seller wants to them, and keep the remainder for your next purchase.

[Disclaimer: I run the site] -- thanks for posting about it!
You are completely correct, when you buy UNITS of the HIM fund, there is no implied or otherwise contractual ownership of part of the legal entity.  Its more like a Mutual Fund, 
when you buy UNITS of a mutual fund - you allow the fund manager to do whatever he/she see's fit with the money being managed, you get no  voting rights about what the manage should spend the money on.
when you buy STOCKS of a company - you do get certain legal rights, such as voting rights at the AGM, etc
With all things Bitcoin, we operate on reputation and trust.  If we didn't do what we say we are going to do, we wont be around long -- The Bitcoin community chastises people/companies/organization very quickly.  By partnering with a long time trusted and reputable exchange (cavirtex) we hope to leverage that to build trust (in both directions)

Actually it doesn't. It escrow's the fee based on what you enter (so the system knows you can cover the fee, IF the entire trade executes at your limit price), but it only charges the fee based on what the actual trade price is, then returns the remaining fee back to you I there is some leftover from the total escrow amount.

Havelock will be paying the full sale value per share. 0.35btc/share on havelock. (Remember havelock SDICE shares represent 100 actual shares)
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:15:05
The article clearly got a few things wrong. There was no freezing of accounts, RBC/TD gave the money in the accounts to the owners, and closed the accounts. the volume on virtex is also wrong. The licensing might be an issue, but only because the Canadian government hasn't given any guidance as to what the licensing requirements are. Compliance is easy if the requirements are known, but until Canada (fintrac) releases something similar to the fincen announcement in the states to clarify their position, the requirements for licensing will be a moving target with nobody knowing the answers.... Canadianbitcoins and Cavirtex are both doing the best they can to figure out those requirements and preemptively follow suggestions from lawyers on how the regulatory landscape might end up in the future. 
@_date: 2013-01-19 02:00:37
Buying SDICE through havelock is one of the simplest and cheapest ways. Our SDICE units are also convertible to mpex shares upon request, so if we close shop for whatever reason (not that we're going to!) your shares are still available to you.

Fair enough :) Actually we do guarantee a return, just not by value or percentage of investment, we guarantee a percentage of what we mine. We guarantee approximately 50% of what we generate be paid out as dividends... i guess its an approximate guarantee, so maybe "guarantee" isn't quite the right term.
I'd actually argue that, if you invested with HIM 6 months ago, and ASIC's came out 5 months ago, you'd be doing quite well, because we'd already have ASIC's mining as well.  Because we only pay out ~50% of what we generate, the rest gets saved for reinvestment in the fund itself, to generate more revenue per share without having to issue new units to cover more capital investment, and thus, not diluting the dividend per share. With BFL's trade-in policy, our current HIM investors actually hold (part of the) ASIC's already. (599/1299 ~= 46%). So investing with us 6 months ago in FPGA technology, was also an investment in ASICs.
That said, we don't obviously have $30000 worth of retained earnings ready for reinvestment in ASIC, but  So when they are actually delivered and sitting on my desk ready to mine, we will be issuing some new units of the fund to purchase the ASICs from our pre-order investors.

We've been developing secure web applications for years, sqli, xss, etc are considerations for every site we develop. For other clients we are often dealing with personal and students private information, so security is of utmost importance.
Our servers themselves are owned by us, not in some shared/rented/vps environment, and we manage the security if them as we'll. I'm a Linux junkie, haven't had a windows install since 1999. Most our services are segregated on different servers, or separate VMs, and finally (but maybe most importantly) we employ a hot/cold wallet system whereby no more than 20% (usually 10-15%) of customers bitcoins are stored in an offline paper cold wallet locked in a safety deposit box at our bank. We are a small business so, no we do not have a specialized IT security person in staff, but at any other large business I could be 'that guy'. Our code is all reviewed internally before being pushed live and I would welcome a review by an outside firm, should we be able to find one that's willing to work for a few bitcoins :)

Actually HIM didn't invest much at all in GPUs. The 28 FPGA's we have are still chugging along nicely, already 100% cost recovered (thanks to ASIC delays) and we have over $30000 of ASIC equipment on order. And why wouldn't we be perfectly honest? It's simple to do the math, we have financial statements on the website.

Let me know of you're interested in listing this on Havelock Investments. I've followed religiously since it started.
