Says the guy who told us that Amazon will start accepting bitcoin in December 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:01


Just did.

What are Drivechains/Sidechains in details? and what's the ETA?

BTCPayServer &gt; BitPay/Coinbase/CoinPayments.
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:40:36
no BTC payment option?
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:05:43
If they only did this earlier, maybe we wouldn't have a dead wallet.. (Multibit HD)
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:58:38
I believe its possible to run your own node or channel or whatever the name is? how can we do that at this point?
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:59:28
Well said.
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:48:10


Not even LN? I doubt it.

I have asked them If the development of Trezor 1 will continue before and they said yes. I'd recommend withdrawing your funds as soon as possible from Coinbase and stick with Trezor 1 order cause the Model T will take some time.

CoinAtmRadar have all ATMs in the world.

For those who want access the K.im demo: 
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:46:15


It's open source so you can run it locally and offline, I believe It's safe.
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:55:54




I see. thanks man
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:10:24
Plans for Trezor too?
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:02:39
Where could someone buy this shirt?
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:32:31
ATMs are not allowed, that's why.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:35:37
Is there is any ETA or source code for this?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:28:45
He got the money from this giveaway and decided to invest intno bitcoin. It's not a misleading title;
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:20:12
It's being accepting bitcoins since years now. lol
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:47:58
I still don't get it. Is MimbleWimble going to be another crypto or built on bitcoin? If yes (for the second), is this supposed to bring anonymity like Monero?
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:08:09
I thought it was going to be released in May?
@_date: 2018-02-25 08:29:01


He is the co owner though, theymos should be able to bring it back I guess?
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:25:20
Exciting times ahead. I'm the only one who no longer about the price? (or at least care less)
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:36:29


How 20 employees will handle support tickets from hundreds of thousands of users?
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:17:02
Is this available on desktop yet? I believe It's cross-platform?
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:06:01
Fair enough. thanks
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:00:32


@_date: 2018-04-06 19:17:05


I can only see 3 icons on the site?
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:09:31
Decentralized internet is more then likely a reference to 'MaidSafe'.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:47:10


It's meant for companies and not individuals. Ledger Blue don't target the same users as Ledger Nano S that's for sure. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:48:24
Hmm? 


@_date: 2017-07-21 06:45:33
and from this I understand that 1st is a non-event date? UASF won't take place at all?
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:37:35
Feel free to downvote this but what's the difference between BIP91 and SegWit2x? is it the same thing as BIP148 = UASF?
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:38:16
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:58:48
If we have mining pools that support UASF, how come we have zero hashing power? I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:12:03


Just because It's running the latest version of bitcoin core, doesn't mean It's supporting UASF, does it? the number I'm talking about is available on UASF.co
