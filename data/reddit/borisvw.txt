I’d rather not haha, didn’t knew hardware wallets were so important. I must learn a lot i guess

Like I mentioned, I’m not waiting on comments like you’re a noob or ‘just dont’. If you are not ready to give a 17 year old guy, who obviously is new to this, some advice, just don’t comment.

So holding it would be better for me instead of trading on sites like +500? I don’t have the intention to watch the shares everyday and anticipate on them. I just want to store them, watch them rise in value and eventually sell them.

So you think that’d be the best option for me rather than invest on a stock site like +500? I’m sorry if you don’t understand me, I’m not from England or a English speaking country.

The video I saw was on National television, but he just acted weird. Even if I wouldn’t have seen it I would still be interested in buying some bitcoins. Now that you know this, are you also convinced I should stay out of the Bitcoin ‘business’?

Who or where the fuck else should I ask it? On or something ??

Is a hardware wallet a must? Is a online wallet not enough?

Thanks a lot! There is also a Bitcoin ATM in my neighbourhood, is it cheaper to buy my coins there or is it just as cheap as buying it online? And which online wallet would you recommend, Coinbase?
