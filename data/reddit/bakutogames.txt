What an idiot why would you not store your money in a offline cold wallet using a pc that has never been connected to the internet for safety. 
Sorry for your loss.  
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:57:07
You forgot you also need to store the key in a vault.  Oh and make many copies Incase of fire 
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:28:19
Wait you finally acknowledge that the concept as implementation are flawed sweet. 
Btc was cool but it's just like religion now.  No one wants to make progress and innovate because "satoshi said"

So pay at the start of the meal and maybe your payment will post before you leave? What if you want to order something extra? You need to know everything you want when you sit down so the one hour+ transaction can post.  
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:53:29
Just because it is stupid does not mean that they can't legally do it.
At any time is some on in DC sees a positive outcome for doing so the situation will change overnight.
Using BTC for this seems like asking for yet another bubble and another burst and putting BTC in the eyes of the older generation as 'drug money'
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:57:01
Also point out in cases of fraud where the store did everything correct the card company usually eats the cost.
  
Additionally it is against most creditcard company's TOS to even check id. The signature and the accepted transaction are all they need.  
@_date: 2014-06-12 05:49:26
I did my first btc transacting about a week ago and it was very simple...
I was like wow I didn't have to give this stranger my cc# then it hit me... If he didn't ship I'm fucked and if I did give him my credit card and he stole it I am protected from the fraud anyways.
  
I like the idea and mining has been fun but I can't see using it for anything other then sending money to other nations... Day to day transactions online no real point to it... Transactions in person such a hassle...
I get decentralized blablabla... But eventually the system needed for it to be used like cash or credit will essentially centralize it.
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:53:31
What's funny is it looks like they gave into yelp as now they have one legit negative review hidden (way to specific to be fake) and two that used to e hidden are now on the main page despite then being fake reviews from the investor and the new owners girlfriend....    
The old bad reviews were from outside the licence area from customers no one heard of(now gone from both main page and "not recommended")... considering we billed after the service and it was a monthly service we knew who every single customer was..
Also every month we told them not interested yet every month they called..     So lets for a second assume you are correct in the workings of their black box system and know for a fact that the algorithm used does not change based on advertisement status.. something is very broken at yelp...  Idk what yelp does but when the system is so broken that it looks like fraud.  It most likely is.
Next you are going to tell me facebook doesnt change a post 'reach' based on being a former advertiser or not ( ill give you a hint your post get hidden  like crazy if you look at pre-ad charts vs post ad)

Like a true bitcoiner you did some top level market research right there.
Have an upvote.
@_date: 2014-12-01 05:05:05
Wait... how are you out money?
You either had the money sitting in paypal and the charge was reversed bringing you to $0 or you already withdrew the money making your account $0 and then went into the negative when the charge back happened. 
It looks like you already took out or spent most of that money.

I get it they are now part of the bitcoin circle jerk. 
They dont help bad business that pay but they do hurt good ones that dont. There is no magic delete button there is just separate weighting algorithms for advertisers vs non advertisers.

You do understand that "you all" is a group and not an individual right?

I used to have to deal with all your snowbirds every damn winter.. Not one was pleasant and every one thought they were a special little snowflake who should take priority over the thousands of other pricks down for the winter who were too fucking stupid to set appointments to have internet hooked up prior to coming and shocked when same hour service wasn't possible. Every danm install half the time was spent being yelled at by other Canadians bitching about "why can't you do it now".... Snowbirds suck please keep them..

This is really good for bitcoin long term adoption!
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:28:57
They offer to hide bad reviews (some from made up customers ) (Edit this is never directly said but heavily implied while talking about their advertising program .... they are the digital BBB.. )for a fee.  If you do not pay this advertising fee they hide all good reviews and remove any star rating given from them while pushing bad reviews to the very top.
They will call you every month trying to get money out of you by "helping you improve your online presence"
I used to have to deal with these shitbags.    We had no bad reviews until we refused their service...also as we worked with people on a monthly basis we knew what reviews were bs by the name.
What's funny is I see that they are out right denying this now... Yet still have the small little print area of "not recommended reviews"  essential removing them from viewers eyes... ATLEAST now you don't have to login to read them..
@_date: 2014-04-16 23:21:29
Guess what no one thinks about cash anymore. 
What makes headlines for the people you should care about are the btc /drug/unstable and its always poorly reported.
Heres the deal. The people you need to care about are not on this subreddit. Everyone here is already part of the BTC circle jerk where anything good about BTC is upvoted.  And aynthing bad no matter how well supported is downvoted to hell. You need to get people involved that are not already. You need to get the old lady across the street educated. 
  
  
If you dont educate them the news will.. Guess what the headline wont be "BTC being accepted for pot in Colorado"  It will be " BTC being used to smuggle funds and drugs"

My point is the company still are not really accepting bitcoin.  There is 0 reason not to accept a bitpay transfer.. its essentially the same as having a third party do a currency conversion for a foreigner 
@_date: 2014-09-17 10:17:18
Proof or I'm calling bs.
Charge backs are for disputes with merchants in most cases. In fraud cases as this would be usualy the ccc eats it. You did what you were supposed to do. Customer never attempted return.

True but once again btc has become drug money to the people who actually pass the laws...
@_date: 2014-06-12 07:25:37
So it's a hassle until it's automated and still required the input of a third party that will most likely charge a fee.

@_date: 2014-09-17 17:37:45
And fraud atleast with visa and MasterCard is usually covered by the processor unless you failed to keep records or "knowingly" accepted a fraudulent transaction. I have never had to pay for a fraud claim and have had several bull shit charge backs over the years and most charge backs for disputes were easy to win.

Ok yeah and comcast tells the truth as well.
Unless they had a lawsuit against them since last year nothing has changed.   As I said.  Fake customers magically gave us bad reviews shortly after turning down promotions with them and all real customers were moved to "not recommended reviews"
The BBB  is basically the same thing.
If you are going to try and read up on something maybe avoid a biased source.

It's a first-hand experience I don't know what kind of proof you're asking for to prove that they're doing something shady I have no way of knowing what the hell they're actually doing in the back room all I know is their final result
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:41:39
Any time a merchant "accepts" coin it puts a downward force on the market because they are not accepting the coin they are just instantly selling it off for fiat

Ok I am talking real card processors not paypal or square swipe bs. 
I have dealt with card processors via Bank of America for years and have never had to pay for a case of fraud if we had the receipt. 
I don't know what crap service you used. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:31:00
Nope that's an alt coin or a fork. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:30:45
No that's just an altcoin going by the same name. Aka a fork 
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:55:53

@_date: 2015-05-05 00:12:00

@_date: 2015-05-15 01:31:25
Why pick a lock when the window is wide open.   Path of least resistance says hack the infrastructure around Bitcoin.  
The dollar bill has not been hacked yet either (yeah that makes no sense) but that does not mean it was never stolen 
@_date: 2015-05-15 13:45:40
My only agenda is to better btc.  And right now treats it like a danm religion and ignores any and all flaws.  
 I was comparing it to the dollar bill which is rather high praise.  
 But let's cover the downside bit coin now double spend   Change being converted into miner fees.  The size of the block chain    The amount of electricity it takes to power the bit coin network  
 It was an interesting experiment but if you treat it like a religion nothing will get better. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:27:09
Because bit coin is inefficient and a data hog 
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:08:01
You mean a currency that does not use massive bandwidth or emits massive amounts of greenhouse gas all to send a few cents? Sounds like a plan.
@_date: 2016-03-20 15:29:21
I doubt they give a shit about Bitcoin or see it as more then trading Pokemon cards in middle school

Yep I have seen that before.  Nice and simple
I'm not using steam however I am using itch.io and it's strictly for my own games (for now).   I also only use one confirm as I don't care about doublespend /whatever since it isn't costing me anything (just the time to manually prestock the db with keys.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:48:18
Hate to say it but bitcoin is crime/fraud/scam heaven.  I trust Bitcoin I do not trust services that popup around it. Anything that offers to store my balance or worse yet convert to usd and have access to my bank account just isn't going to happen
I don't expect many if any btc transactions as even the big stores have issues with getting people to stop treating these as stock and start usin them as actual money.
Any coins I do get will stay as btc and used to pay any coders/artist freelancers I hire and are willing to accept btc.  
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:57:48
None.   But it is looking like I may just roll with this 
My original idea was to store a bunch of adresses and just reuse them (after each transaction is finished or failed for several days) and then just check blockchain.info with a get request of those addresses several times per hour however that URL I linked looks like it would achieve the same result without me having to do constant get request.         
As far as store front it will be simple.  Just a buy in btc button with will take user email and show the btc address to send to.   Once good response is retrieved from API or what ever I will just fire off an email with the game key
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:02:03
I pay 0 for both.    What shitty bank do you have that charges you for a card?
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:05:16
Sounds a lot like what I'm working on for my backend.   To bad it seems demand for this stuff kinda dried up otherwise I would love to try and make merchant Bitcoin services a good little side job 
@_date: 2015-09-05 13:18:32
Wait so they would rather pay a fee to buy it a fee to send it and a risk of devaluation over just paying a small tax?
@_date: 2015-04-22 11:49:14
Well I am using blockchain.info so a third party is involved.  But sure when I get home I'll post it
However the sample code they have on their site and the sample the have on github are both great (git hub one is a little more complex with confirmation page etc etc)
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:39:58
I thought Bitcoin was money not an investment.    
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:25:40
I will look into this ones API when I get home.  Thanks
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:28:22
Considering in USD it runs on a pay what you want (with a min price) If a user wants to send more it wont be turned down
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:49:59
Said I do not wish to use any one else's services.   Looking for a way to get block chain info via php or other server side method but without running a node or wallet on the server
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:59:28
Well I am using their payment API.  I guess I could do a failover and then fully explore the block my self and use a round robin on the addresses (like I originally planned because it sounded fun to try) but that is much more work and more bandwidth used
@_date: 2015-04-18 16:25:19

So it looks like a weighted system taht reduces earning based on time in pool and raises to normal as time goes on? is that correct? 
If so I do not really see an issue. This script I made is for use on common use pc's for people who couldent decide on what to mine.  Was not really intended for a 24/7 production rig  these machines would have short times in the pool anyways. 
Now if some one could not decide and was leaving the pc on 24/7 they could change the time frame between switches to a day  or what ever
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:41:04
Let me know if its clear enough. 
should be really easy to set up and easy to add more onto it if you feel inclined. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:16:45
Its really simple.... as long as you are admin and have no spaces in your username or filespath leading to it.     Literally all it does is switch between four programs using .batch commands 
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:40:08
Nope? care to enlighten me? 
Anyways if you can launch it from a .batch you can use this its just a script
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:51:46
First thought as well,
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:51:12
It should work with any program that can be started via batch file. 
I am cleaning it up now and adding comments. Will post download ASAP
