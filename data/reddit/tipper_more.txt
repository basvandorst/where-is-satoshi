The features you speak of should be integrated into the upcoming release of [SocialX]( If they can send tips to Facebook and Youtube users without a tipbot, why not domains as well?

Not to ruin any surprises, but as we transition into adulthood it becomes our responsibility to embody the spirit of santa. Just as those have done before us, it us up to us to send gifts and holiday cheer. We cannot expect one fat man, however jolly or automated he may be, to take care of everyone at the same time. Unless of course your religion says so, in which case it must be true. 
Create a campaign, not a bot.

A simple transaction, peer-to-peer, was free from corporate oversight for a number of years. Then Changetip, Circle, Coinbase, and others appeared. Now praise of them so often hears. Their puppets send tips funded by investor monies; Upvote, downvote, and leave out the honey. Buying puppets and trolls and changetipping cheer will bring a million new changetippers by this time next year. 
Government oversees all stuff down to the what on your bit. Did you declare a capital gain on the sale of it yet? When you acquired this security, how much did you pay? You sold it for dollars, for how much, on what day?  Record it on your Schedule D. It's due on the fifteenth. That's April, not May.

We can expect the mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies to be a long process. In an effort to speed up this process we can choose to focus development on implementations that provide the greatest appeal for outside investment funding. Decentralization, while a superior motive, is not enough to initially lure most business and governments out of archaic methods of record keeping and exchange. That being said, it would be great for you to educate the world in regards to how we can benefit by developing blockchain technologies. What specific implementations will provide enough benefit to influence immediate adoption?  While we all run around creating small projects that most people don't yet understand, what big projects can we develop together that will truly make the world a better place?
Not everyone is happy about large companies throwing around tens of millions of dollars and hiring ex-corporate bigwigs to sit upon the board of new Blockchain 2.0 companies. Using their power to influence governments to adopt whatever legislation best suits their corporate goals. Using the money of investors to fund a tipping army or to pay the trolls. Monopolizing or dominating certain blockchain implementations. How can the industry best defend itself from this style of corporate domination? Are such concerns warranted? Does it stifle the competition and provide a barrier for entry?

The sock puppets are so embedded into Reddit now that they appear to us as elders. Experienced. Wise. Respected. We shun new users as trolls, when the true trolls already have us surrounded. The biggest tipper leads the way. +beer RDD

Most current tipping is processed by bots. 
By entering a command like: " +beer RDD " or " $0.01 " the bot transfers the tip. The recipient often must register for bot by sending some sort of response, " +accept ," for example. Upon registration the recipient can use the funds within the bot, or withdrawal to an outside wallet.

Reddcoin plans to deprecate tipbots and integrate tipping directly into the wallets. Verified social network identities (ex: Keybase) will be stored in the blockchain. +champagne
