So car titles are not currently run on ETH, but smart contracts in theory could.  Let's say you assigned the public wallet ID to an asset, you could do this with a physical tag, or engraving or no physical tag.  Inside of a smart contract you can designate and customize a lot of functions.  So in the case of a car title.  Right now the state controls the ownership of a car.  If you and I want to transfer ownership of your car to me, we would need some sort of bill of sale, then on your title you would fill out the sale information and sign.  I would then go to the DMV, have them process the sale of the car, print up a new title and pay taxes.  If your car title was held on ETH, and keeping the government in the car title transaction.  You would open the public wallet ID associate with your car by plugging in your private key.  Much like any crypto wallet this would give you control over this asset.  You could then send the title to my wallet.  The government would be notified by the smart contract and apply a counter signature, or private key, to the one your entered, authorizing their permission for you to transfer your car to me.  Once that happens, your title would be in my wallet, and owned by me. 
Sorry if I made this too simple, but I am just trying to relay this info without getting too deep into the woods.

Think of it as business rules, in theory you could eliminate large portions of labor intensive work at a company.  You could create automated accounting systems, purchasing.  Smart contracts can be used to represent an assets ownership, like a car title or house title.  It can be used to run logistical systems and disease surveillance.  It is the biggest jump in processor potential since the internet, and it’s not just about currencies and ICOs.

The amount of requests I have been getting off linkedin from financial advisers looking to understand crypto currenies so they can offer them this vehicle, is crazy.  I have a big network and have had 3 inquiries in the past week, and have a call setup for Monday.  For us, its no problem to buy bitcoin or any other crypto and put it on a wallet and hold, or spend.  For your 60 year old parents or grandparents that have really real amounts of money but no tech skills, its not so easy.  Many people dont deal with their own finances at all, so buying bitcoin is way outside of their wheelhouse.
There is a large market out there of people who want in, but need an easier on ramp than dealing with it all themselves.

Until we have another split and coinbase holds her hundreds of dollars worth of some shitcoin hostage while she loses out on cashing in on those, or holding them or whatever she wants to do with them...  Looking to November for more splits.

Right now bitcoin is the center point for all Altcoins, unfortunately we dont know how this looks when all the major economies of the world start to convert over to cryptocurrencies.  For all we know the US and EU pass major regs against non state sponsored crypto, while that would likely not kill bitcoin, it would harm its current and future value.  That all said I think bitcoin works really well as a reserve currency once it is scaled, but we will see. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:39:52
You need to buy bitcoin before you can buy most other cryptos.  So if Xcoin takes off, there will be a massive pass through bitcoin, which will then have prices rise, volume rise and there for moon.  Yes there is better tech out there, but they are testing grounds at this point, the good tech will flow to bitcoin, the less good or bad will stay with the altcoin.  Also most altcoins, even though many will argue, can not deal with the volume that bitcoin deals with.  Tech for 100k people is a lot different then what you need to service millions and eventually billions.

I agree but at the same time, past performance is not guarantee of future success.  If bitcoin failed tomorrow I would be devastated, so I mean I am on this boat too, but to say its unkillable is not true.  Be reasoned and rational, at this point it seems healthier than it has been in a few months, but who knows what the future holds.  Bitcoin might be around for a hundred million years, but might be worth nearly nothing.  We just don't know, don't delude yourself into thinking you're on a rocket ship sailing through the sky when you're really just playing Kerbal...

I think you kind of missed the point of post.  What they are saying is that if new value of USDT was $10m a day, as in $10m cash was being used to buy USDT each day.  You are still conflating what they are saying with the idea that each trade is the same as an initial coinbase increase trade.   Does that make more sense?  I will try again if you are still having difficulty.

Just wanted to address the Greece fixed money vs free float.  Nothing is stopping a country from Greece to create its own currency based on something much like the Ethereum ERC20 tokens.  This would be tantamount to the gold standard, but allowing for inflation and deflation of their currency depending on what was needed.  Crypto does not need to work only on bitcoin, bitcoin can be used at the "peg", or part of a basket of currencies.  A crypto country like Greece is less of an issue to a Euro Greece. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:12:55
They say this yet it took over 4 hours to get a confirmation with BCC when I used it like a month ago.  So with all your theory my actual experience has been considerably different.  My bitcoin transaction, when I am buying stuff is confirmed pretty quickly.  When I am moving from one wallet to another outside the bitpay paradigm, it is usually confirmed within a couple hours max, if not less.
Honestly your "not really" is just in theory because the actual is working much different.  Not sure if you are just listening to to much FUD and not actually using crypto or if you are a troll who spouts bullshit just because they think they are smarter than other people.

I don't see that happening.  The risk associated with them choosing the wrong chain is huge.  LIkely 2x will not be wroth enough to keep large mining farms online.  Worst case... Mining reacts in a similar way as it did to BCH, once the writing is on the wall, they do what they did with BCH and normalize back into BTC.  May be it will be a little worse since there will be 3 chains, but my guess would be 2x fade about as quickly as BTG.

just want to throw out my two cents.  I move bitcoin around a decent amount and have never paid more than a $5 fee, and that was to move a lot.  My experience is usually having a fee which I consider to be acceptable for the value of what I am moving.  I used bitcoin cash, specifically moved it a couple times then sold it, the transaction times took as long as bitcoin and it costs the same in transaction fees.  
As for timing... I can stand to wait. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:22:16
not long, once the coins are in the exchange it will take minutes to off load.

Fake news, recently I moved a decent amount of btc, I paid $4.50 in fees and had it moved and multiple confirmations in like 2 hours.  When I did the same wiTh BCH the fee was marginally less and took 8 hours for enough confirmations to appear in Poloniex...
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:19:55
$20?  I just moved like $10k coins and it cost under $5.  I am sure that is not much of a difference to an ultra poor Venezuelan but its my truth.

IMO that is not what a person who understands Ethereum would say.  Smart contracts and becoming a blockdrive is the best use case.  Uggg... 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:10:42
Interestingly enough I agree with you on a bunch of points.  I think that a larger block size is something that will and should happen with bitcoin.  I think SegWit is a good addition, but I agree that implementation leaves a bit of an open question.  That said I think the community would be crazy to reject the current 2 mb proposal, as it would force a split and also possibly activate miners to take the SegWit coins just like you suggested.
Furthermore I think the argument that a 2 or 4 mb block would centralize nodes is crazy.  I have said it before but if you are running a node and can't afford to double or quadruple your hard drive space then you are not really invested in bitcoin, but you are attempting to control its future.
I personally think that BCC would be a shit show, and would fall in price rapidly and we would likely have an ETH vs ETC situation.  I also think a split would hurt bitcoins price like crazy, it would be very very painful, but I think there are a lot of interested parties that realize this and would like to avoid that outcome.
My biggest worry right now, is the approval of Alphabet's options trading platform will bump up activity so high that we will need to have a whole new scaling debate even before the 2mb blocks are implemented.
Its a strange time in this wonderful world.  Hopefully the loudest screamers will calm down, and get some more perspective.  To the moon good sir! 
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:19:29
lol dude it has SegWit already up and running, and the full real version of it at that, so yea it has a huge advancement over bitcoin.  Not to mention that litecoin has always meant to be silver to bitcoin's gold. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:55:00
While I think the ICO market has created a huge bubble, at their base they are all Dapps that plan to add some sort of functionality to the crypto space.  Its going to take time from the point of raising money until you start to see results, or failures.  Ethereum IMO is all about Dapps.  Right now I am working on two Dapps for my company specifically for the Federal government.  So shit be changing. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:13:06
Yes of course.  People have billions of dollars of value on the network, do you think Vitalik is the only one who is developing on Ethereum.  I can give you proof that it would go on... Look at Ethereum Classic, Expanse or any of the off shoots of Ethereum.  Of course it would go on.  
Don't feel so threatened there is enough space in the crypto market for there to be many players.  Bitcoin can not and should not fill every need and use case of digital assets.  Calm down and revel in the wonders that is the new world order. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:45:03
I agree, I love a lot of cryptos, I even like ETC, but not a fan of ETH.  Centralization and the eventual collapse of the ICOs is a huge issue that seems to get glossed over in all these articles I read about ETH being bigger than bitcoin, and smart money is pulling out of BTC and buy ETH with your 401k... ETH is dangerous and the uninformed are flocking to it so a couple DAO supporters can make a lot more money than they already have... Seems like BitcoinPlus right now. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:21:07
To say that BCC is the same as CLAM is disingenuous.  I am not saying that  BCC is in any way a good idea, but a lot of people support it, even if you and I don't.  There will be value for the BCC coin, it might be relatively worthless right now, but its being created incase the 2mb block is not supported after November.  If we don't see a blocksize growth we will see people that are pissed and start to develop for, and use BCC, so we will see the value of the coin rise.  Yes coinbase probably does not need to do anything at this point in terms of functionality, but to ignore the possibility that they could have value is not really productive.  
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:26:45
I mean I am not panicking, do I seem like I am panicking (Sounds of a paper shredded in the background)... All is fine here, stop looking at me!!! 
JK JK... I am not worried, I have done nothing but buy this wonderful dip!  That said if the scaling issue leads to a split in bitcoin let's not pretend that it would not result in a major devaluation on both forks that would take years to recover.  Most people don't have a risk tolerance to accept that possibility especially as it moves closer to d day.  These are what we call weak hands, which I am sure you know.  Bitcoin is functioning, and I love it, that said I have had issues with buying items and having hung transactions.  Right now I have about $484 of bitcoin tied up with bitpay and newegg on an order that was not filled because the price of bitcoin changed 75 cents before they could confirm.  It does not make me hate bitcoin but it does make me realize there are some issues with network speed, which sucks.  BTW both bitpay and newegg are dragging their feet and laying off responsibility to refund me on each other, which is also a huge issue, but I can't blame bitcoin for that.
Any how, yes people will panic, and they have every right to do so until we clear this hurdle.  I'm just hodling over here and hoping for the best. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:48:21
I dont think you understand the technology or what is being built on it at this point.  There is so much development happening, not just on the protocol but on Dapps and smart contracts that are transforming the business world.  I think that Ethereum is here to stay, but agree its not a store of value.  The thing is the stuff on it is valuable and it is transformative.
That said you did say its your opinion so I respect that you have enough forethought to even have an informed opinion.
Cheers and happy friday!

They were the same dudes saying blockchain not bitcoin is the big technology and bitcoin will fail.  They are the same dudes at the conferences trying to push their new blockchain technology that is essentially just a public/private key generator connected to centralized databases, asking for $50k a month for what essentially amounts to a fancy password generator (Looking at you Gem). 
All I am really trying to say is these dudes are as big of a joke as they were when they were stealing millions from grandparents and new home owners in 2006 - 2009, now they are just trying to figure out a new way to steal from a new set of people.

Just going to put this out there as an SW supporter and someone who thinks EC and big blocks are risky.
BCC while weak does have supporters, but a lot of detractors.  There are people who have sizable holdings in BTC who would want to see the BCC value crash and would be willing to offer up BCC on exchanges for ulta low values, hoping to drive BCC into oblivion.
If this is true, and that is a big if, the price of BCC would plummet the second it becomes available, but after a couple days/weeks the price would start to rise again.
If you are not in the first group of people selling BCC and getting some amount of value, holding makes the most sense, not hodling.  Wait for the price to recover and hit its real equilibrium and sell.
What is the right price?  How do you know when it has hit bottom?  When the price roughly matches the hashing power.  So if 3% of the hashing power from BTC is on the BCC network, I would likely say that BCC is worth about 3% of BTC.
This analysis may be wrong, I might not be taking some things into account, but since I dont plan to sell at 12:00:00:001 tonight, I am just going to wait and see what the hashing power does.  
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:50:13
Wait you are saying you want BCC?  If that is the case and you have time, can you let me know why you would prefer it?  This is not meant in any way to critize you, I just want to understand your perspective. 
Thanks!
