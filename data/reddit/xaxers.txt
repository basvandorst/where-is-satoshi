I'm sorry you do not know what war and sanctions both mean, but sanctions are certainly not war.

This is completely false.
The number of preventable deaths during the 1990s (not 1991, when Albright was Secretary of State) was *total* 500,000, and that number was due to *sanctions*, not war.  And, incidentally, those excess deaths came in areas that the UN was *not* allowed to deliver critical supplies, but instead in the areas where Hussein remained in control.  


This is completely false as well.  Jesus Christ.

Actually, they were further in the mainland.  In Kwangtung, no, but that was because their army there was just lost.


This was not at all on their minds, when the Soviets did enter, it was a shock to them, and not because it meant that an invasion of the home islands was going to happen sooner.  It did mean that there was no chance for a negotiated surrender (even though the Allies had made it clear that there was none already) through a neutral party.


The military leaders, who were calling the actual shots, thought that forcing an invasion in the home islands would force the US to negotiate better terms.

Plenty of people at the time in Britain thought it was just that.  This incident was the first time anyone in Britain really gave pause as to what the military was doing to prosecute the war against the Nazis.
