They are indeed tradeoffs, but some allow significantly better privacy at minimal cost. Even CT alone to hide transaction amounts in Bitcoin would be a huge improvement, and would at the bare minimum make mixing strategies (and the lightning network privacy enhancements) more effective.

Private enough for who though? It's weird how the system is only private enough for the experts who are willing to attempt complicated guides. The Bitcoin privacy wiki recommends solo mining funds. Good luck with that.
Indeed nothing is perfect, but I think saying "Bitcoin can be private" is more optimistic than practical. Bitcoin's privacy benefits are only achievable by the extremely experienced. And as long as efficiency is given priority, privacy will never get the attention it deserves. There needs to be a more reasonable balance.

Bitcoin is a decentralized network open to anyone. That's one of its biggest strengths. Expecting everyone to be experts at privacy or even fully understand the implications of what they are doing is a dangerous assumption in my opinion.
We can blame users for not understanding the difference between using HTTP and HTTPS all we want, but the bigger impacts will be caused by actually getting services (Bitcoin network) to update to provide these features without end users thinking about it.

I completely agree. I am skeptical about ZCash, but the underlying technology still seems to be a step in the right direction.

Not a hoax. We made the flyer, not them. It's supposed to be a joke.

There are two ways the paper looked at how to link transactions. These are:
1. Zero mixin inputs, where transactions are sent with only their own input and not selecting others from the blockchain. Since early 2016, these transactions are no longer permitted on the Monero network; all transactions must select at least 2 other inputs. Thus, this is no longer an issue at all.
2. Temporal analysis, where they see which other inputs are selected and try to guess which is the real one. This is still a concern, and it is being better addressed in the Monero hardfork in September 2017. The paper states that with the latest transactions, they can guess the correct input in a ringsize 5 transaction (mixin 4) about 40% of the time.
Thus the conclusion that "80% are linkable" is itself misleading since this includes a ton of transactions that are either old or irrelevant. It includes all old transactions where a mixin of 0 was used, and it includes transactions such as pool payouts where literally no one cares if it is unlinkable or not since pools publish payment history anyway. Regarding the second point, pool payouts were the majority of Monero's transactions in its early history when a mixin of 0 was allowed, so it not all that surprising that a large proportion of transactions are linkable among the *total history*. [A participant who helped write the paper acknowledges this]( For real transactions, we speculate this amount is much lower.
**A better conclusion is that among all *new* transactions, you can try and guess the correct input 40% of the time (with 5 inputs), but you still do not know with absolute certainty.**

I think most people overlook this most important benefit of privacy: fungibility.
Unfortunately, attacks and theft happen. The WannaCry ransomware attack was widespread, where the attackers encrypted machines and demanded payment in Bitcoin to decrypt them.
Everyone can see exactly what coins are in this address. Thus, every time you receive Bitcoin, YOU are responsible for verifying that you do not accept WannaCry money. Exchanges already use services to audit incoming funds based on regulatory pressures.
Suppose you receive payment of 0.1 BTC for a completely legal sale. You then deposit this money from your mobile wallet to your exchange. You better believe that you will have an immediate visit from the police.

I'm not quite sure what you're arguing. You're completely mixing up the effect of inputs and outputs.
Monero absolutely takes advantage of the aggregation property. For a normal transaction with 2 outputs, it uses the aggregation property to a small extent. For transactions going to multiple people, including exchange withdraws, mining pool payouts, or other batch payments, the effect is very large. Some of these transactions have 20 outputs or more.
I never claimed bulletproofs have anything to do with ringsize. Afaik, these are completely independent. This is on the input side of the transaction.

[Since the paper was published, the Monero official clients have selected the majority of the inputs from the last 1.8 days.](
Re: Bulletproofs
Bulletproofs are big for both CoinJoin and CryptoNote. They reduce transactions sizes significantly.
Your math regarding the increasing blockchain size is respectfully ridiculous. [It reminds me of this xkcd]( With the current *inefficient* system without Bulletproofs, etc., the blockchain grew by 20GB. No, hard drive storage doesn't double each year, but increasing by 30GB a year isn't insanely unrealistic. Again, I'm not dismissing your concerns, I'm just saying your approach to discussing it is misleading.

Bulletproofs reduce the Monero transaction sizes from 13kB to 2.5kB, with proportionally greater savings for multi-output. Pretty significant savings.
Notes: 
Bulletproofs benefit anything that uses confidential transactions.
