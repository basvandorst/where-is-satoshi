Tom has consistently made correct calls on big inflection points to buy or sell over the past couple of years. On top of that his price targets have been conservative because he bases his predictions on big slowdowns in bitcoin user base growth. This dude is smart and at least has some track record of being right more often than wrong.

I don’t think your plan is going to fly.
There is a strong argument to be made that crypto/crypto trades aren’t like kind. Each token operates within its own ecosystem and can’t be directly swapped with each other (the nascent atomic swap technology notwithstanding). Sure they’re traded in the same exchanges but so are stocks, but you must pay capital gains tax on bartered stock for stock sales. Gold and silver are sold in the same shops and are both precious metals, but you must pay capital gains tax on a gold for silver swap based on current USD spot price.
Plus, the IRS has every reason to interpret the existing rules broadly and in their favor. It’s not worth the risk. The IRS brought down Al Capone, I don’t think they’ll have a problem grabbing you by the ball hairs when the time comes.

Need help installing the new lightning desktop app on Ubuntu. I just finished downloading the blockchain on bitcoin core software and confirmed it’s accepting incoming connections through the Bitnodes webpage. I downloaded the Lightning Desktop App Appimage and source.tar.gz from the lightning labs github but not sure where to go from there. When I try to open the Appimage it asks me to select an application to open it with. I’m a Linux newbie and can’t seem to find a detailed guide for this online like there were for the bitcoin full node.

The target of the current bubble is somewhere between 40k and 110k, if we follow the same 20-&gt;200-&gt;90-&gt;1200 pattern we saw in 2013. This is a bear trap, if so.

If your investment time horizon is long (5+ years) it doesn’t matter much whether you DCA, drop it all in at once or wait  for a price drop. If you insist on waiting for a price drop, buy after a +30% pullback, knowing it may drop more (up to 90% in fact) before it ever reaches a new high from when you bought in. 
My educated guess is that we are in the first or second inning of a new bull market and I wouldn’t wait long for a “deal”.  Go in planning to hold for at least several years.

If obtaining bitcoin for a long hold/wealth preservation buy a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet from the manufacturer website (not a 3rd party) and keep two copies of your recovery seeds in geographically separate, but secure, locations. Do not keep your bitcoin on an exchange for any extended period of time.

Are crypto to crypto trades (btc for eth, for example) subject to capital gains tax on their fair market values in the US?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:52:02
100% agree that we are approaching bear trap now. Hopefully we get a run towards 30k before another return to 10 or 15k. Real bubble begins in the next 3 months in the push to 50-100k with “return to normal” (I.e. the mega dump towards prolonged sub 10k prices) late next year. Legislative action to suppress bitcoin by a major western government could provoke this dramatic bubble pop. We ain’t seen nothin yet.

But aren’t you “spending” your crypto to buy another crypto asset? Keep in mind the IRS has already ruled that bartering gold coins for silver coins is not “like kind”, even though they’re both precious metals. Likewise just because your trade was with two distinct cryptocurrencies, if they exist in completely different ecosystems and don’t interact with each other, why would they be considered like kind property?
The recently passed tax bill only explicitly made it clear that crypto for crypto trades are not like kind going forward. But that does not mean they were like kind trades in the past. The rules in this area are vague and it would be prudent to expect the IRS to interpret them in a way that they receive the most tax.
The bottom line in the US is if you make money, the tax man will get his cut one way or another, even with crypto to crypto exchanges and even if you never converted back to fiat or USDT.  It will be very interesting to see how they deal with the people who’ve made significant amounts of money over the past year and aren’t reporting their shit. 
Be careful folks!!

Yes, of course this will happen. But it’s a cycle that bitcoin has been through 4 times before. It will “crash” to a low that was higher than the previous high.  Didn’t anyone see the recently recirculated ultrasarc video about....this one time....bitcoin spiked....and then it CRASSSHED...to the previous bubble’s highs. This rinse and repeat will continue for a decade or more until it changes the landscape of finance and banking. 
I believe the target for the top of the current bubble is between 40 and 100k...and then it’ll CRASSSSH....
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:27:51
Is this not the case already???
Previous tax law has already ruled that you must pay capital gains tax on the fair market value, if applicable, when you barter swap a gold coin for a silver coin.  The IRS is going to gratuitously ass rape any crypto traders that have been doing this and not paying capital gains tax because crypto to crypto trades are not “like kind”. They already have their hands in the coinbase cookie jar and will make very public examples out of some big time traders before too long. This is why the long term buy and hold strategy is good in this area.
Bottom line is if you are making capital gains on any crypto to crypto trades it would be highly prudent to report them and err on the side of paying more tax than you should. Otherwise spend your money now on an industrial size container of butthole vaseline.

For now, we are living in relative halcyon times. The next time a centralized banking/financial entity gets busted for gross negligence approaching the scale of 2008, bitcoin will be ready and waiting for the increased demand. 
I think it says a lot that bitcoin has been successful while the legacy banking system is currently working pretty well. But we’re all aware of the underlying cracks in the foundation. The time will come when those cracks lead to another crisis one day. The infrastructure of the bitcoin economy has grown such that the appropriate onramps are in place for big money to enter when the rest of the market is tanking.

Every person that has acquired bitcoin and held for at least 3 or 4 years became more wealthy than they were before.

What kind of processing power and RAM do you need for a setup like that? I have an old desktop I got around 2008 that I’ve been wanting to use for a BTC and/or lightning node. I think it’s around 1-1.5 ghz with 1-2 gb of RAM. It only has a 250 GB hard drive so I was going to slap a 1 tb USB drive on it to hold the blockchain.
Does that sound feasible?
