I'm actually surprised to hear so much negativity around this subject. To be honest I feel like there are places where bitcoin could make a change now. Take Cuba for example. A country where access to money and ownership of anything is extremely limited. Imagine those family members who made it to the US being able to send their poor relatives btc whereby it could be exchanged in country and used for goods. Or if those people could buy and sell to each other using btc bypassing the current two currency system the socialist government has imposed. I think in some cases we're being very short sighted in the fact that there are some areas of the world where bitcoin could work now, if the people were educated on how it could benefit them, and the risks associated with holding it. 
That being said, I am concerned about what it means that only the ultra wealthy own the majority of the coin at this time and over the next 100 years. It will likely have to change hands many times for it to trickle down, but as many have said, it should deflate, not inflate as time goes on.

I agree. The only time the alts go up is when the bitcoin price remains steady. As soon as there is a fork, or the price of bitcoin goes up. Those alts get dumped fast and lose more than 30% vs BTC. I think Golem is probably one of the few coins that has a big announcement coming out with Brass soon. The rest of them have no use cases yet. 
If you want more BTC in the long run, it's best to be very choosy with your alt endevors.

If someone had invested $50 in Lykke in October 2016 when they did their ICO at $0.05, they'd have gotten 1000 tokens/shares which would now be worth $270. 
If they had invested that same $50 in BTC in October 2016 they'd now have roughly $800. 
Recently Lykke also moved from a completely decentralized exchange to a semi-decentralized exchange. They said this was temporary, but there is no telling when it would go back to decentralized. 
All I'm saying is, I'm not sure it's worth being bullish on Lykke. Maybe this Switzerland news will be good for Lykke.  Maybe Lykke is the big project Switzerland talks about in the first paragraph. I don't know. 
Alpereum.ch certainly didn't fair well in the end.

It is "open, public, neutral, borderless, and sensorship resistant." Anyone who doesn't value those things will certainly not see Bitcoins value.
This is the response to people who say this. I agree with OP. People and the media often say Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and isn't backed by anything. Best to educate them rather than talk price.

"This would entail that all nodes on the Lightning Network know only from which directly connected node a transaction came – and to which directly connected node it must be sent"
If the second last node/hub for a transaction was my node/hub, would the recipient of the transaction or previous connection node/hub in squence know any information about my node/hub that would expose details about its physical location whereby they could seek it/me out and expose my anonymity or destroy my hub? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:14:43
I've heard this rhetoric before many times. Calling out Andreas like this is just ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:26:16
Lightning Network isn't the only build that is taking time. Golem was hoping to release brass much earlier and it ended taking them a lot longer to work through some unforeseen difficulties as well. They too would rather get things right before just rolling crap out that would cost them more in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:33:48
As I mention below...Doing lighting without segwit removes useful features as heard here at 4:45
Increasing block size comes at the expense of security is what I am understanding. If there are more groups getting paid...ie miners, node operators, hub operators, the network will be more decentralized and more secure. There has to be incentive for these groups and that comes in the form of fees. Fees don't have to be huge off chain and there will be competition keeping them down. With most micro transactions being held off chain, fees will come down on chain as well. It does make sense. But OP has clearly posted something here that is of great concern to anyone that thinks big blocks is the easy answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:23:28
I think Andreas said competition within the market would bring node/hub fees down. The way I understand it is if the the block sizes are kept small, then more people could run nodes world wide, and someone in the world is going to price fees below the next guy to get the work...so to say. So if tons of these networks exist and you can teleport all over the place, it would be incredible.

I haven't heard popular media figures saying much about what kind, if any second layer solutions are being considered for BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:25:33
The simple solution is not often the correct solution in life. I think OP does a nice job of bringing up this fact. The repetitive nature of what Roger Ver says, along with the obvious short term non-technical easy to understand fix is certainly drawing in the masses. BCH may be a good short term investment strategy and useful for now, but its usefulness will soon run its course, it's deficiencies exposed, and eventually be abandoned. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:44
I read the chapter on LN in Andreas' book 2nd edition and I got the impression LN could be more private. One thing I heard in this interview with Elizabeth was that rather than opening up lanes to get where you need to go, LN would allow transporting to where you need to be. That seems better if it works as stated.

From a purely nontechnical standpoint it would seem that way. It's unfortunately not the truth. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:13:35
I find most of what's on both of the subs propaganda and memes. I've gathered most of my info on bitcoin from reading Andreas' 2nd edition book, watching interview videos from both sides (most recently a dollar vigilante interview but others more often then his) and reading additional technical articles...some of which admittedly goes over my head. I don't agree with everything everyone says on either side...but I feel I'm starting to grasp the basics and I'm choosing to side with BTC. This thread being one of the first I have even commented in with anything remotely useful to contribute, thanks to the OP bringing up something other than propaganda or a meme.

Sounds not as hard, but there seems to be a lot of waiting. What if I'm in a rush at work and it's a new vendor that I haven't set a LN contract up with yet? Of course, this is all assuming they know what the heck they are doing too. Most people still don't even use Bitcoin on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:52:29
If nodes/hubs can remain hidden/anonymous with LN (or something developed in time that competes with LN) and people can bypass large corporately funded nodes/hubs via small private ones; then bitcoin will still be decentralized and very private. Regulations surrounding Bitcoin will not matter, and will not be stopped. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:41:35
I think it's pretty amazing to see this all playing out. It demonstrates how a fork of this magnitude requires a massive amount of support and carries with it real financial risk to the parties involved. 
I also think it's amazing strategy by those who are manipulating btc by suppressing it in this bear market, bringing the market share back up past 50% and reducing the investor support on other coins. When they decide to let BTC rise big again, it is going to be something amazing to watch.

I used to get excited talking about Bitcoin starting in 2013 and going into 2016. The talks were basic, and I could understand Andreas and other people talking about the subject for the most part. 
Following the forks, and the massive price increase and then drops, the topics of interest started to become technical to a point it started going over my head. Now things are so confusing with BIP this and that I have no idea what is really happening. I felt like I used to have an opinion on things. Now I don't and I feel somewhat distant from the meaningful discussions and more so stuck with meams and anti roger or whoever else type topics. 
How can I get back into some of the technical side of things without getting lost in high end coding topics that are over my head?

Quebec claims enormous equalization payments from the rest of the Canada by skewing much of their finances to look more and more like a have not province. One of the ways they have done this is by charging people/businesses so little for their hydro that it makes it look like the province isn't making any money.

Won't the Venezuelans just end up pegging the bitcoin to the cost of the bolivar? Like, if it costs 1,500 bolivares on the black market to buy eggs, would those who have eggs then not just charge people 0.0000026 btc? And if the bolivare continues to inflate, then the price in satoshi's would go up as well no?

For example, I look at a place like Cuba and outside of it not having good internet infrastructure, I see it being a prime place where Bitcoin could have the perceived value it needs to act as a currency. Plus many people with family state side, and tourists coming to and from the country with regularity; it could present opportunity for them to make transfers, bank themselves, exchange for their own currency, trade with others;  rather than be confined to the rations their own government hands out to them. With time hopefully the price stabilizes, or trends up so things improve over time for those using bitcoin as currency.

@_date: 2017-10-21 16:10:07
Sure, but I do recall one of his videos last year where he said Bitcoin will probably need a compromise where there is a block size increase and off scale transaction capability. That is not a quote, because I'm just remembering it. So it might be wrong. I gathered from him the segwit addition plus a small block size increase would be good. What this S2X thing is I don't even know. I just don't have the time or technical understanding to figure it out on my own. I want the unbanked to have opportunity and I don't want anyone's liberty to be taken away...but I don't know what to support in this debate to make that happen.

Yes I am serious. I laugh at Craigs opening arguments often now too, because I have heard them so many times. Really it is a fast paced route to making the points he needs to make during short debate times which he can then elaborate on.  Robert Bellahs book is probably the best at defending the naturalist ideas, but guys like Sam Harris don't even understand their own world view to this extent, and wouldn't be able to hold court with someone like William Lane Craig. The debates between Richard Dawkins and William Lane Craig will go down in history as some of the best.

They would have to be held down by something. Cuba is exposed to hurricanes. Also, Cuba experiences a number of power outages. 
This type of strategy could work with help from Cuban people themselves. Cubans use a lot of flash drives to get 'the package' and this would be a great way to distribute anything with a 'how to' or 'read me' file. 
Getting all of this into the country would be quite challenging. A collaborative effort would be paramount. I hope someone like yourself is successful in this. I don't have the tech savy to figure it out. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:53:03
Have you been to a hotel in Cuba that has free 'stable' wifi that doesn't cost over $200+ per night? I can't seem to find one. Even if you could get users benefiting from that node, the bandwidth problem alone would become the major issue I would think. 
And even if you did, most cubans can't even get these apps on their phones, let alone if they've even heard about it. What would they even use to buy the bitcoin unless tourists were willing to buy their cuban convertible peso, or national for bitcoin. 
It all seems quite far fetched.

I just did my first transaction with an atm earlier this month with blockchain.info. I thought I read something out there that said I could get the private keys from blockchain. Anyway, this was the reason I chose not to use coinbase but it looks like my brief research was flawed. My plan was to save up 1BTC and then transfer onto one of these offline hardware devices to lock away in my safe. How will I go about doing this now? If I choose to transfer to another wallet (AirBitz) perhaps it would be better now when I have less BTC so I'm not paying transfer fees on a larger amount come move time.

I have copied my phrase down and put it in my home safe. In security preferences I used request spending password and have copied that down and hid it in another spot in case I forget. 
Do you guys have any other recommendations for me in setting up this wallet? What's is the enable coinbase, glidera services options?
