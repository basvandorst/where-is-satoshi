I have friends that are well off enough where money is pointless they invest in buildings etc anything to be remembered.

The best way I can think of is follow the dollar or any other world currency's rise to power. I think undercutting loans etc with no interest and easy to obtain credit on Bitcoin could quickly make it popular anywhere once they have it they can spend it.

When you are already as rich as they are that young the only thing you want is to be remembered its the one thing money can't really buy but does help with.

Wow thanks I've never received bitcoin before. I might start doing this in other sub Reddit to get more people interested.

I agree it could easily fail and easily be a success only time will tell no theory or idea will set it in stone.

Anyone using a service like put.to I like the idea of having my torrents in the cloud and no software on my PC.

Short answer: You want physical gold and silver nothing has held value for thousands of years like they have. Bitcoin could grow with the fall of the US dollar if people go to it however it could fall too to a new currency. I think a 70/30 split metals to bitcoin is good but that can be adjusted to your risk level.

The numbers identify the bank and what type of account so its easy to block them.
