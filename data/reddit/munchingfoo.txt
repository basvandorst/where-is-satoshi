The UK has had a public sector pay freeze since 2010. It's now at the point where some degree qualified nurses are earning just over minimum wage. In the last 20 years of my career I have seen a huge gap open up in UK pay vs US and at the same time the pound has weakened against the dollar. It's not good at all over here.

Why would you try to reverse engineer and jury rigg a broken crypto currency when there are newly designed coins that don't have any of these ridiculous pitfalls?

Probably 0%. You're effectively gambling with borrowed money, even if the initial spend wasn't to buy crypto. In this situation I would realise your gains in crypto and pay off your debts. Make a plan to repay the rest of your debts and once you break even then start investing again with a broad portfolio.

Not necessarily. If the prosecutor feels that this was the proceeds of crime than they can sell it and return the value to the public purse.

That's not money, it just paper. Money is an intangible description we assign to a tangible object. When we no longer choose to assign it that description it immediately ceases to be money.

Can you give some indication of how secure your previous password was please? Length of password? Dictionary word? Used on other sites?  
  
Do you save your Reddit password in your browser or do you type it in or use a password manager?
  
If it was a strong password it suggests a vulnerability within Reddit somewhere which would be worrying.

I wouldn't worry about the location of the IP addresses meaning anything. If they were genuinely the IPs used to access your account then it's likely that they were proxy zombies.

So, if my original assessment is accurate, as the price drops past $3500 the market gets flooded with buy orders at $3500. This means that people with lower price buy orders or people with sell orders priced low to dump get priced out of the market. This causes a momentary flat price. The people trying to gamble and "time the market" then panic buy because they think they've hit the bottom. This causes the price to shoot up as demand outstrips supply. Then eventually the triggered buy orders run out and the market timers have got their coins so everything returns to normal and the price drops again. This all happens really quickly with bitcoin because everyone is watching it like crazy and it's relatively easy to buy and sell.  
  
I should add, you never really get a flat price. What happens is the price shoots below $3500 then shoots back up because of the buy orders. This little spike triggers the panic buying.

I love the implied personification of market events. Who is they? I don't think there's some kind of mysterious force at play here.

I think your point 3 makes your other points moot. If people have successfully used distributed denial of service against miners, such that they had to take action to defend themselves, then this is evidence that some form of denial of service with the resources of a nation state could wipe out some mining pools.  So I suppose the next questions are: how have mining pools beefed up their defences, what would it take to take them offline and are the resources required to do this within the cost appetite of a nation state actor like China. My gut feeling is yes, but I prefer evidence rather than conjecture.

Okay then I think we agree.  
  
I think the one major deviation between my thoughts and crypto currency investors is that I think government banks will take control and peg a new crypto currency to their existing currency and every single one of these decentralised systems will become worthless. But that really is just my opinion with very little solid evidence to back it up. It's why I don't own any crypto currency at present though.  
  
I think the best bet at the moment is likely to be investing in a crypto currency developer if they float if the tech takes your fancy.

If world of war craft deleted all of your special items you would be losing cash value but there's no way you could take blizzard to court over it and win. Bitcoin is exactly the same in today's laws, which will likely change as bitcoin, or another ICO, becomes accepted by the establishment

If someone robs a million from your bank the national law enforcement will conduct a huge investigation. If someone steals your 1m value paper wallet they'll say, "what?".

You have literally ignored ever one of my relevant arguments with a three word sound bite. If this is the sum total of your investment strategy oversight then I wish you lots of luck on your gamble, because that's what it is if you don't have specific counters to the negatives of an investment.

Your link to the second Life case centres around intellectual property for which you already have protections in almost every developed country. Bitcoin is not your intellectual property.  
  
I agree that digital assets will "become a reality" but we are far from that position and everyone should treat their bitcoin with as much personal safety measures as they can afford.

Did you read this before posting it? So if coinbase closes your USD wallet whilst it still has a balance you are covered.. If it closes you bitcoin wallet and takes all the BTC you are only covered in a tiny number of countries who recognize digital currency. They can literally take everything from you and there's nothing you can do. That's why the big holders have external wallets.

If someone robs you of a piece of paper at gun point then of course the police will investigate. But unless you never intend to get that paper wallet out of your bank vault ever again then it's highly unlikely that someone is going to frog march you into a secure facility whilst holding a gun to have to get it. For a million cash equivalent in bitcoin a thief can afford to spend years of surveillance watching you just to pick exactly the right time to pounce.  
  
For example, the first place I'd look is Reddit. Look for all of the people that claim to be a bitcoin millionaire (this has almost certainly already happened). Now also cross check against people that say they deposit monthly after their paycheck comes in. Okay, now you have a shortlist of really plausible targets. Time to work out their real identities. For a million payoff that will be very easy.  You want to filter by country, but for a million you can afford a bit of international travel. Now I sit and watch the chosen person in real life. Perhaps sit outside his house using the WPA 2 vulnerability to check his routine. From months of observation it will become apparent when the target is most vulnerable. If it's a paper wallet, I don't really have to do anything that clever. Just check the window when he has it in his possession and see where to strike. After another couple of months I'm ready. Then I go and steal a piece of paper. That's it. I probably don't even have to use violence, but if I would do I will ensure it's minimal to avoid escalating the offence.  
  
From there I immediately transfer to another wallet and disappear. Now I can do whatever I want in slow time.  
  
Chances of owner getting their money back: nil.  
  
Chances of me getting arrested: slim to none.  
  
There are very few scenarios where this goes bad for the offender. If it all looks a little difficult then I'd just move to the next target on my list.  
  
So how can I protect myself against this? Only post with month long throwaway accounts unlinked to other things that identify you. Register those accounts with one  time email addresses
 Use a VPN to connect to Reddit. Never tell anyone you have a million in bitcoin and never tell anyone "how secure you are" because you do X. Security by obscurity is the best form of security in this case.

How does bitcoin scale transactions when everyone in the world uses it for every transaction? Doesn't it become computationally infeasible? Who mines the bitcoins and checks transactions when the complexity causes the energy/equipment price cost benefit analysis to be negative?  Will transaction fees rise to supplement mining income? Low transaction fees is one of the most commonly touted positives of bitcoin. 
  
I love crypto currency and it's definitely the future but I can't fathom how bitcoin scales this far on its current tech.  
  
Furthermore, 80% of bitcoin is currently owned. How do you convince the 99% of the population that they need bitcoin when a tiny fraction of the population will own all of the wealth from the outset (I appreciate the irony)? Bitcoin or another crypto currency will exist but to extrapolate all global money supply and say bitcoin will take the entire global currency market share is completely delusional.

That thief? Albert Einstein.  
  
 A source or two would be incredibly helpful in this instance.  
  
Your first sentence suggests uncertainty but your last proclaims absolute certainty. I can only find one source relating to a court ruling that in game items have real world and therefore removal of those items from another person is theft. This occurred in the Netherlands so if you are Dutch, open the champagne, otherwise you'll be waiting for your own country to [change their laws]( and in the mean time coinbase can do whatever they want.

What is your background? Are you a specialist in cryptography and cryptographic algorithms? Have you managed large scale IT service management programs? Have you done any calculations regarding power consumption required to use bitcoin for every real world transaction?  
  
I have a PhD in cryptographic algorithms, I work with cryptography every day, I manage global information system infrastructure as my job, and I'm soon to be a chartered electrical engineer. I wouldn't claim to be an expert on crypto currencies but I think it's a fair guess that I'm better informed of potential blockers to large scale infrastructure projects than the majority of users here.  
  
Remember that my post was in reply to someone that said **bitcoin**, and bitcoin alone, would take over the entire world's financial system. Even if you ultimately think that crypto currencies or similar will take over all real world transactions (as I do), why would it be bitcoin over the other ICOs with new and improved technology? I imagine that ultimately each government or trading block will run its own crypto version of its real world currencies in the future. I wouldn't put a probability on it but it's far higher than bitcoin being the sole unit of exchange in the entire world, as was claimed.  
  
I'll leave you with this as food for thought: bitcoin's blockchain technology is not quantum safe. The first quantum safe blockchain algorithm has just been announced. Should we all buy that instead?  
    
We are currently in a similar position that the dot-com bubble found itself in. Hundreds of options and only a couple will survive the test of time. The OP made the claim that only one winner would emerge and it would be bitcoin. I think he is deluded on two counts. One that bitcoin will survive the innevitable bubble burst (it might, but it's no more than a guess at the moment). And two that when it survives it will be the only crypto currency that does.  Even if you subscribe to the former the probability of the later also being true is next to nothing.  And that's before we've even considered how we rest power from the FIAT monopolies of today.  
  
Tulips are great. Tulips are a good investment. The Netherlands still sells tulips. But if this was 1637 you'd be seeing the same types of people spout the same garbage with no basis in facts. Sure, buy tulips, but don't think you are going to get a 40000% ROI as the original poster claimed about bitcoin. Anyone who thinks that is deluded.

There was a very short lived rally around about the time this was posted. Price rose very sharply for a couple of hours then continued on its downward trend. I suspect the price hit a popular automatic buy trigger (maybe $3500?) Which caused the price to jump, then when these orders fell away normal business resumed. I've seen $3500 listed on quite a few posts here as a bottom price so it wouldn't surprise me if lots of people placed $3500 purchase orders.

You're wrong in one sense in that if the united world governments did decide to adopt this currency as an international medium of exchange then you could be assured that they would implement protection methods and legal frameworks.  
  
You're right because the above is never going to happen on any sane planet in this galaxy.

These people are all crazy. Reserve currency or complete liquidation alike. Do they seriously expect that one day the federal reserve will turn around and say to all the hodlers: "we didn't get in on the bitcoin craze so we've lucked out. Here's $3.3m dollars per bit coin for your trouble. Thanks for having the foresight"?  
  
No what they'll do, if they want crypto currency, is start another crypto currency backed by the federal reserve and bitcoin will be relatively worthless.  
  
Bit coin has no USP. Anyone can create a crypto currency and one backed by governments is far more likely to garner massive public support.  
  
Sure, have fun now, make some cash, actually use the bloody currency or all you are doing is contributing to an artificial bubble and there is **never** a case in history where that ends well.

I'm pretty sure that market manipulation of bitcoin is not insider trading because insider trading is related to regulated stocks and other securities. Bitcoin is wholly unregulated. As far as the law is concerned today, bitcoin is no different than limited edition magic swords in world of Warcraft.

I dabble in corporate governance and legal and policy frameworks as part of my job. I understand exactly what regulated company means. It means it abides by a certain set of regulations. Unless you know exactly which regulations those are it means absolutely nothing. Unless you know which regulations apply in your legal part of your specific country then it means absolutely nothing.  Furthermore, a lot of your regulation protections disappear when a company ceases to be a company.  
  
Saying a company is regulated means the squared sum of fuck all. Saying that bitcoin is a regulated asset and all exchanges meet a minimum framework agreed by all G20 governments with individuals being held responsible for corporate crimes means something, but of course isn't true at all.
