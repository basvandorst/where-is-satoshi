The point of Bitcoin is to transfer easily between wallets, so I assume yes this would be easy to do, transfer between wallets from different exchanges and bitcoin buying/selling platforms like coinbase.

I am no expert, but I heard blockchain.info wallet can import private keys that are encrypted easily and then just send the btc to a bitcoin qt wallet.  Just a work-around suggestion.

I am having trouble with this one too. add two numbers together and skip two places and the sum is in that 5th location is the pattern I initially saw.    example    
    3+4 skip two places to 5th location = 7    
    4+1 skip two places to next location = 5    
    1+2 skip two places to next location = 3    
    that's where it falls apart    
    2+7 != 5

It doesn't have to all math either, I saw one sequence that was in alphabetical order if you wrote out the numbers.  I don't get this problem.

My account says "Buys and sells are currently paused. Please try again in a few minutes."

Also missed is that bitcoin is stored in the cloud or on a computer.  They missed that the private key can be stored offline on a piece of paper.

You can use bitaddress.org or coinbase has an "Print paper wallet" in Settings--&gt;Integrations.  The address on bitaddress.org is generated inside the browser and not over the internet (is what I understand).
Edit: Read this comment:

I thought they said you can cancel the order up until it goes through.  That's the way I read it.

Make sure you have 2 factor authentication on localbitcoin.com.  Or to be crazy safe, send your btc to a single "cold storage" wallet (offline wallet so no one can steal your private key by hacking into your computer or login) that you can make on bitaddress.org.
