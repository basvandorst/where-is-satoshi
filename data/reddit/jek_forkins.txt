Let ideas be discussed freely. If the opposition must be silenced to have your way, ask yourself why that is.

Yes, but your fork will not be "bitcoin" in the sense that no one else will agree your chain is the most valid one. However, users have every incentive to support the chain with the most computational power behind it.

Why doesn't Blockstream go make their own altcoin instead of hijacking the bitcoin network to develop their corporate products?

Bitcoin's current throughput limit was just fine with the hardware and network infrastructure of *8 years ago*. Do you believe that these things have not improved since then? That the network is incapable of handling more bandwidth?

The Chinese miners all kept up their end of the agreement. Core did not. Now the miners are pissed at Core.

Just because I'm using a new account doesn't mean I'm new to Bitcoin. I was using Bitcoin before you "proved" that it could never work.

"leave the rest of us alone"? That's exactly what he did. He's implying that those not running Core are not part of Bitcoin.

What is a bigger change of the rules? 
* Changing an anti-spam bandwidth cap that was introduced as a temporary measure 6 years ago? (Block size increase)
* Fundamentally re-structuring what a bitcoin transaction looks like, creating a parallel blockchain, and requiring all bitcoin applications to spend their own developer time refactoring their code to be able to handle the complex new format? (Segwit)

Enough hand waving and appeals to authority. The issues are not so complex that only members of Bitcoin Core possess the unique knowledge of them. If something simply can't be explained in an understandable way, it's probably bullshit.

FIBRE is a centralized network maintained by Blockstream. You guys seriously don't get bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-12 19:15:35
Correction: Only miners can decide to fork. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 19:12:25
But it's operated by Blockstream. Just because the code is open source doesn't make it decentralized.

Blockstream's main business is to build permissioned sidechains on top of bitcoin. They benefit from a congested bitcoin network, as this drives usage to other blockchains. 
I keep hearing from Core, "if you don't like what we're doing, go make an altcoin!"... if Core doesn't like what Bitcoin is, why don't they go make all their shiny widgets as an altcoin instead of co-opting an eight year old financial network to build their stuff on top of? [Building on top of it is fine, the point being that they are attempting to fundamentally alter what bitcoin is so that their products will work.]
Whether this is what is happening or not is not clear, but that they are in a position to do so should be worrisome to anyone who believes decentralization is a core tenet of bitcoin.

They were mining the classic blocks before the agreement, and stopped after it was signed.

You are trying to frame users exercising their free choice of which software to run as an attack. This is false.
@_date: 2016-10-12 19:13:47
So who gets to play central banker in bitcoin and decide which transactions are "worthy" or not?
@_date: 2016-10-23 22:44:03
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:31:54
Does that invalidate the argument I just made?
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:02:48
Please explain who gets to decide what a bitcoin user is. Apparently you think you have that authority.
