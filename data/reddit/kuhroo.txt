Thank you!

Check out BitWallet. I've been using it for a few weeks and it works perfectly. By far the best option in the App Store.

Thank you, kind person!

Clearing Safari cookies and data also wipes the wallet, FYI.  It might be kind of self-explanatory, but worth the warning! I did it accidentally on my iPad, but it was an empty wallet.

It launched breadwallet for me

I second this idea. Also, allow for sweeping of BIP38 keys.

There's no "fees," but they charge a few percent higher than some of the other exchanges (Coinbase, etc).

I'm not sure it would be compatible with any other apps/services. That's why I would only use a wallet such as this for spending in small amounts. Leave the bulk of your coins in cold storage, but keep smaller amounts in apps like this for easy spending.

Search the App Store. There's already a couple of them. BitWallet and Coinpocket. Make it happen.

It's not only available on iTunes. You can find it on Stitcher Radio or directly from the RSS feed (

Did you include a miner fee? If not, that will definitely cause a delay but will eventually get confirmed.

Recently recorded a podcast all about Bitcoin. Trying to get the word out there! I have almost convinced my wife to start accepting Bitcoin at her salon. Baby steps.

Any news on the app launch? My wife owns a hair salon and I'm trying to find an easy way for her to accept Bitcoin as payment.

Well I'll keep my eye out for it! Hopefully you can get it approved soon. Good luck!

One just recently launched. Seems to work perfectly!

Tell your iPhone friends to get BitWallet. Definitely the best option in the App Store. The one you are referencing requires you to sign in to your blockchain.info account. Big no-no as far as I am concerned. BitWallet on the other hand, very solid.

I second this. Don't know why people aren't talking more about it. The send feature is a little crippled, but still useable. Overall, super clean app that more people should know about.

You can send from the app, but you have to paste the transaction directly to blockchain from Safari. The app makes it really easy. This is my new go-to wallet.

My buddy and I have been recording a podcast for the past year or so hitting all sorts of topics. Recently, I have really been getting into Bitcoin and all the possibilities I see coming out of this technology. Naturally, I wanted to discuss the topic on our show and our last two episodes have been Bitcoin-heavy. My partner went from ultra-skeptic (as you will hear in the first episode) to setting up a Coinbase account and installing a hot wallet on his phone after the second. More people need to just learn about this technology, hence why I am posting here. Check out the episodes and let me know what you think! You can either click the iTunes link above or simply search for The Bottom Line Cast on iTunes or Stitcher Radio. To the moon!

Couldn't agree more. Still waiting for that "killer" app that does everything, which I think this could be.  But, BitWallet is in the lead for me at the moment.

I've only used a credit card linked to Paypal, but those charges come through like regular charges.
