Thanks dude i spent all night reading and watching broker platforms. and i came to the conclusion to go with , kraken , too bad they having a 404 problem so I couldn’t activate my account.
Do you think kraken is a good option? I went with it cause of sepay and i live in europe . 
And thanks for putting up with me :d 
Iam happy that i know / understand a bit what holding is and going to do .
