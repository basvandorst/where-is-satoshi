What happens if you take a loan from the network and don't pay it back?

I'm not here to join a cult or anything. I am in this to make money. What could be more important than that?

This community is a very special place.

I've been trading forex for several years, so talk to someone who cares.
I know what high risk trading is. I stated that I am using very high risk. No risk, no money.

Wouldn't you, I don't know... maybe consider doing what the most successful people are doing?
I mean, if your goal is to make a profit, and not to worship an algorithm.

You effectively can't. Brokers do not want your account in the negative and will do everything possible to prevent that from happening. It's technically possible to go negative, but it's so incredibly unlikely. Especially on an asset that is traded 24/7/365.
In fact, it is so unlikely that you might as well not even take it into consideration. Turning $22 into $2000 is FAR more likely than turning $22 into -$1000 or even -$0.01. We all deal with risk every day, and you are not being logical. Either you don't have any experience with how leverage and margin work, or you do, and you're being intentionally obtuse.
What a rediculous debate.

How dare you discuss selling the sacred coin. You are now sentenced to running mining algorithms on your phone for 30 days and 30 nights.

I get it now. This sub is the cult of bitcoin, not a place to discuss trading strategy. I mean, why would you ever sell? SACRILEGE!

Prop firms that trade crypto are using leverage and get no bailouts. Your argument is absurd. Banks make calculated decisions. I promise you that they are not making business decisions with the hope that they have to get bailed out down the road.

About to withdraw another $1k in profits today. From an initial deposit of $200.
I'll be crying all the way to the bank my dude.

Currency exchanges will not go away when bitcoin hits 10k, 100k, or 1000k. Currency will always be traded against assets, whether it's bitcoin, gold, oil, USD, whatever.
Currency doesn't disappear. It has value. That value goes up and down. If I capture the bitcoin growth in USD, my account has now increased proportionally, or rather at 500x the rate of bitcoin due to my leverage.
So if bitcoin hits 100k, and my account is in USD, that's fine because my account is now worth 10 million from bitcoin growth.
You are effectively betting that fiat like USD is going to be worth zero overnight. OR at least that's your reasoning for owning bitcoin. That is a far riskier bet than simply using leverage.

Whats the point of trading bitcoin on an offshore broker, held in encrypted wallets overseas, if I have to report my income?!
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:51:20
...? I meant in the context of crypto markets and investing. Jesus dude, climb down from your white horse.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:37:33
Those currencies still have a specific value. You're actually making my point for me. If someone from those countries had bought bitcoin, they would not suffer from the inflation. The value of their account increases.

You sell at 18 or 18.5 and you buy again once it breaks through the high. Also, learn to trade. You are basically trading FX or a commodity, so treat it like such and learn charts.

I think youre looking for a broker, not an exchange. I use Hugosway. I was cautious at first, but they have been great with support.

I've already withdrawn 500% of what I deposited, ya dork. Go back to lurking.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:46:56
Yeah, I'm not claiming to be a genius. Buying bitcoin dips is the easiest money ever. You can enter a trade with confidence like no other. That's why you'd be a fool to use no leverage.
