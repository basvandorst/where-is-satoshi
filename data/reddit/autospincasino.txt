Anyone thinking it's shaping up to claw back to last week previous highs in the blink of an eye is in for a rude awakening. Good luck with that!

As long as it will take you to be phised or some other seemingly retarded move that will clean your wallet dry.

Dunno.  You're telling the story.

Grow up you bunch of whinging pussies. So, you got in at the wrong time and have seen 25% wiped off the price. If you had accomplished even 10 minutes understanding the possibilities you would have been well aware its a fucking coin toss each day with this easily manipulated shit. No one thats been around in 2014/15 era has one ounce of pity for you numbslulls. Battle hardened warriors that we are having dealt with 75% down swings which make the past 24 hours merely a blip on the radar. The whales see the rise, mop up on the fall and rinse and repeat.

Well done to the OP for at least using BTC for its intended purpose I.e goods and services. The buy and hold brigade seemingly think it's as simple as parking the bus and collecting on go.
 Theyll be in for a rude shock soon when the actual users of bitcoin who used it as it was intended abandon it in favor of what looks to be  btc cash and monero at this stage. The TX fees have now made BTC redundant. It isn't sporting good stores or restaurants that bitcoins usage was built on.
Should be interesting to see the next 3-6 months play out.

Yep, by gambling money that you couldn't afford to lose. Learn from that and move on.

Maybe it's that eggnog talking? More fantasy than a lord of the rings book in those walls of text.

0 AD - 6/2017 AD -Buy at whatever, transfer straight, get high! Rinse and repeat.
6/2017 AD - ?/2??? AD - Buy at whatever, transfer with an anal prolapse inducing fee that you pay for, get high whilst still not being able to sit down thanks to a ridiculous TX fee. Adios

You can cardless cash me a series of transactions to the aud equivalent and ill reciprocate with the equivalent BTC ;)

Did you buy your bitcoin at aliexpress? Super good prices,  anywhere from $2-3 per coin. Hows these idiots paying up to $19,998 more in price!

So a common man devised and designed bitcoin. With that in mind, I guess that redefines the 100% of us here into the borderline retarded group now. Woot!

Before you dive in mate as others have said it has its issues. I totally expect it to drop further personally. Blockchain tech can be easily replicated and one very important matter that seemingly all the MSM and the large majority here either decide to ignore or are willfully ignorant of is that BTC transactions have been near totally driven by the illicit drug trade. For it to be of any purpose it simply has to be transacted in exchange for goods and services. I dont see any of these new buy and hold adopters discussing the fact they also need to use it for it to grow other wise its near useless if everyone just holds. 
BTC is now at stage where it's use for the illicit market has run its course, the TX fees required are way to large for what makes up the average illicit sale of around $200. Combined with any washing services TX fees its now redundant. 
You want to make money in the immediate future? With bitcoincash and monero seemingly shaping up as the new preferred choice for the dark markets, that's where you'll see the larger and faster price rises. 
You can thank me later;)

All im saying is that it took nearly the whole year but congratulations on winning 'The Most Shamefull And Downright Embarrassing Post' for season 2017. 
You got lucky with a price rise, nothing more and nothing less. Dont fool yourself that you know anything about trading. 
You gambled and you lost. Suck it up like a man, have some self respect  and move on.

Grab a bottle of lube and hit the local hot spots buddy. It's the only honourable way out of your predicament. Just remember to whisper 'no homo' before teeing off.
