You're quite beautiful but why pay any btc, when we can get everything on the net for free?
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:30:14
Lol that's classic.
@_date: 2019-11-23 02:56:36
You make a good pitch.

Doubtful. I know a handful of docs and they are all own a ton of bitcoin. In fact two of them bought way back in 2015. As if they weren't rich enough. Highly paid doctors have a lot of extra money to throw at investments and do so quite often. At least that's been my experience with them.

I don't have threads about people being surprised. Not even sure what you're talking about.

Everyone too busy drying their eyes and looking for a hug.

No need to read the article now.

For 95% of the alts out there, I don't think they'll ever moon again, regardless of what Bitcoin does. Sure, they will go up, but we're never going to see those 10000x gains again we saw in 2017. That was a one-shot deal, kind of like the beginning of the dot-com boom. You were either on it or your missed it. Now all you can hope for is that your day trading skills are up to par so you can continually build your stacks.

"It seems around Christmas..." 
It seems or it does? Which is it? You know we have historical data for BTC right? Quick check on coinmarketcap would actually tell you what happens every year around Christmas. But hey, let's not be bothered by facts. Lol

Why does it have to be a competition between stocks and coins? That's dumb.
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:04:35
That is hilarious, creative, and awesome. Well done sir.
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:27:28
LMAO +1 for you sir

She reminds me of Ricky Bobby's wife.

Lol this sub cracks me up. If you can't trade for profit in a manipulated market, why trade it at all? Move to stocks where things are less manipulated and there's no Tether bullshit to deal with.
