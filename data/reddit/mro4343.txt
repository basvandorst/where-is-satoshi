Do you understand what a market is? It is individuals and groups of individuals needing goods and services (never going away), and other individuals and groups of individuals producing those good and services (never going away until perfect robotics and unlimited energy), and then exchanging with each other (never going away until everyone personally owns perfect robots, unlimited energy, and elemental transmutation). 
There are two kinds of markets: free and not free. Not free = coercive. 
Edit: sentence fragment.

I coerced that  $5 in bitcoin from you, because I had the sandwich and I'm white /s

You're anti free market because it's coercive?

Watch the video u/Halfhand84 posted under my first comment, it is anti-markets.
I happen to agree with your larger point: the current form of capitalism is very crony.

I watched the video, thanks for the resource. My issues with it would be:
Democratic rule is tyrannical/coercive, particularly in the workplace.
Without markets, you don't know what goods and services are needed, or what value to assign them.
All goods and services will consume more resources and be more scarce when you do away with specialists' ability to focus on their area of expertise.
Hypothetically, even with an overall culture in favor of such a system, there would be some who will dissent: who only want to work in their area of expertise or who can't get the goods and services they want with the income they have. What happens with these people? Are they arrested? Are they quietly done away with? You can't have this system without a coercive force similar to police. 
TL;DR: you can't have this utopia without coercion. Free markets are the least coercive option.
