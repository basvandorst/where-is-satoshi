It's a free web app. Hopefully some kind people will donate so I will never have to introduce ads on it. :)

Hello again,
I just updated Mercury and added some new features that you guys may like. First of all, since the beginning there is **no** registration required and none of your entered data gets saved on any server, everything you enter stays on your device in your local storage (HTML5 Web Storage). Mercury shows profits, allocation and historical performance – for one position, a single portfolio or your total portfolio. For now Mercury works best on a mobile device added to the home screen. In the future I will be focusing on optimizing the desktop version.
**Sync your portfolio with your exchange wallet**
– With Mercury you can connect your account to your Bittrex, GDAX, Binance, Poloniex, Bitfinex, HitBTC, Liqui.io, Livecoin and Cryptopia exchange wallet (API key needed) and sync your balances to your portfolio – no more time-consuming manual entries.
**No registration, no database**
– Mercury works completely without any server-sided databases or any registration. Everything you enter is saved as HTML5 Web Storage (local storage) on your device.
**Keep track of your profits**
– Enter your total cost of your total portfolio or on a coin basis to keep track of your profits easily.
**Find out about other crypto currencies**
– In the new "Prices" view you can see the current prices of all supported currencies and check their historical performance.
**Multi-currency support**
– Mercury currently supports USD, EUR, CHF, GBP, CAD, AUD, JPY, HKD and CNY.
Feel free to check it out here:  and let me know what you think! 
You can check out a demo video here:

Due to number and currency formating with the library I use the symbols need to be different, so I hope you and your friends are happy with A$ too! :) Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:47:08
Oh shit my bad! Totally forgot you guys! Will push an update for AUD in a minute!
* Do you aussies prefer $ or A$ as currency symbol? :)

The new update will support:
- Multiple exchange wallets such as Bittrex, GDAX, Binance, Livecoin etc.
- A price view which shows you current prices and infos on coins you don't have.
- Multi currency support has been added - check your value in your own currency.
**And still, none of your entered data will be saved server side and no registration needed!**

Sorry, but I don't understand. I don't save anything related to you on my servers. Everything stays on your phone. It only shows you the price of a crypto currency multiplied by the value you entered. Or what's the issue?
I really don't understand how you come up with that. I stated in the release post that you don't have to register or that anything gets saved on a database.

Hey guys, I wanted to show you my personal web app called Mercury.
It's a crypto currency portfolio tracking mobile web app that shows profits, allocation and historical performance - for one position, a single portfolio or your total portfolio (if you have setup two portfolios). It works as web app on your mobile device, so you can just add it to your home screen and start from there.

**Privacy is key - No registration, no database**
Mercury works completely without any server-sided databases or any registration. Everything you enter is saved as HTML5 Web Storage (localStorage) on your device.
**Simple Bittrex sync**
With Mercury you can connect your account to your Bittrex Wallet (API key needed) and sync your Bittrex balances to your portfolio – no more time-consuming manual entries.
Mercury currently supports USD, BTC EUR, CHF, GBP, CAD, JPY, HKD and CNY.
**Data from CryptoCompare**
Mercury uses data provided from CryptoCompare and supports over 30 currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, NEO, Monero and many more!
**Free of charge**
For now Mercury is completely free. 
Please keep in mind that this is a private project and things might break. The web app is currently optimized for mobile devices, at a later stage I'll optimize the desktop and tablet views. If you encounter any bugs or have issues, feel free to comment here or pm me - I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible!
I hope you guys like it! :) ...and that my server does not get hit to nirvana.

Thank you! :)

I'm not sure why he says it's about trust since it stores nothing on the server except the prices for the coins, everything else stays on your phone.
Yes, it basically is a blockfolio variant just with multiple portfolios and the option to sync your balances from bittrex.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:56:44
Thanks! Currently there are some over 30 different alts already built in.
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:19:38
It does only import your balances, not your trades.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:55:46
Yes, exactly!
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:58:59
If I find the time (and money) to spare to add more exchanges I'll do that. Which exchange in particular you would like to have?
Hmm, that might be an interesting idea. I'll look into that if I find out how to do that.

As in the post and on the website stated, it saves your data on your phone in your web storage (HTML5 localStorage) and uses this data to show your portfolio - nothing is stored server-sided. Something like a cookie. Does that make sense?
