How did someone steal your wallet? Trojan?

I'm with you. Bitcoin is not perfect, but its a far step forward to fiat currencies and the problems that come with them. The power of  Bitcoin gives us more freedom, and control that just can't and won't be provided by out current system. I am not anti-government, but tired of putting the power in banks and large corporations who get to make the rules.

I've been sending suggestions for a while via the support system, but they seem to go unnoticed. I've also referred quite a few new customers to VOS, however half of them have thrown up their hands because it takes weeks to get verified. Support doesn't respond for at least 24-48 hours via email, and get very rude on the phone which turns off customers.

Fuck paypal and anything resembling it.

Ebay and Paypal will decline over the next few years as sellers find new alternatives. Competitors will appear, embrace cryptocurrency and everyone wins. In fact, this is the exact project I am working on!

Nice - finally a place I can use my coins :)

It amazes me at all of the people who do not understand the concept of Bitcoin. Don't keep your coins in the exchange people, unless you are performing a transaction. Pull them out and keep them in your own wallet. Better yet, keep the bulk in cold storage until you absolutely need them. Simple!

This muthafuckin' guy right here. I'll be waiting...

If you must insist on photocopying your wallet keys, follow at least 2 of these 3 rules:
1) Unplug the copy machine.
2) Set the copier on fire.
3) Set the Bitcoins on fire.
Then you can be sure you are safe.

You put your bitcoins in the microwave. That way, and latent radiation is burned off.

Who Satoshi actually is relevant - not to Bitcoin but of human interest. If he doesn't want to be identified we all should be respecting that. He started a revolution that may one day change world economics and the way we conduct business. That's why we want to know and meet him, he may still have more to offer in terms of solving Bitcoin's problems. If not, so be it. The rest of us will fix it.

This is huge news, I'm glad I am Canadian at this point! VoS still has to improve in some areas, but I'm glad I stuck with em.
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:37:53
Can you share some details on how you created it? Looks great!

If things don't work out with any of these guys, you may give me a ring.
