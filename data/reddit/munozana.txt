Bitcoin related art that can be sold for bitcoin. This the invitation that I sent to some artists:
Calling all artists interested in Bitcoin and all crypto-currencies!
On the last Tuesday of every month, 20Mission*  host the largest Bitcoin meetup in San Francisco with around 200 people attending.
This event it's happening on Tuesday, February 25th and  we are looking for artists interested in making pieces that express your thoughts on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple, and to  imagine how the world would change with the new and upcoming financial innovation technologies!
Join us for a night of Bitcoin experts, aficionados  and industry leaders in which your pieces of art will transport us to the future to re imagine  our current financial system.
The pieces will be up  for one month and they  will be a great  inspiration for  our Bitcoin HackFest, a Bitcoin hackathon happening on March 1st and 2nd.
The pieces will be for sale and can be paid with dollars or Bitcoins.
If you are interested in participating, please drop a line to ana for more information.
