It's not the same as just brute forcing the private key, it's much much easier (even with the added image processing).
When you're brute forcing a key you must guess a full key, and if it doesn't work all you learn is that you guessed the wrong key.
With a blurred image, you guess a key and learn not only if it's wrong but also a rough idea of where it's wrong (non-matching pixels). In the extreme case you can guess one or two letters at a time with a good enough image, resulting in 58*keylength instead of 58^keylength .
This is because brute forcing a key is done with with no prior information, whereas here even a blurry image provides you with a huge amount of information.

There's two issues here. First: people might worry that the app creator (you) can use the seed maliciously. Second: people might not think the seed will be safely stored.
No matter how you solve the second problem, you'll never attract people who aren't willing to share their seed with the app creator ever (a good practice). I'll be waiting for a version that allows MPK input instead.

The current bitcoin protocol stores transaction amounts as integer values with a value of 1 corresponding to 10nBTC (satoshi is a silly name for a unit). While third party developers are free to store it as a floating point value, doing so would be a mistake for many reasons.
For any app following the same protocol as the reference client, nothing would change except how the values are displayed.
I know not everyone follows these rules though, but it would be nice.

Carrying a USD balance only makes sense at an exchange. Coinbase is not an exchange. I'm not sure why people don't understand this. If you're trying to use coinbase like mtgox or bitstamp, you're gonna have a bad time.
See [this]( post for a longer explanation.

Unfortunately increased difficulty also encourages people to form giant pools like BTCGuild. Last I checked, the top two pools controlled roughly half of the total network hashing power. If they got a bit bigger and colluded to manipulate the blockchain, things could get bad (though it's possible that if they tried, all their miners would just move to honest pools).

Did he just stop talking and process the deposit? He might have just been making small talk while working... Also bitcoins aren't illegal but it's not unheard of for a bank to refuse deposits to an account you don't own.

Dealing with small or large numbers written long-form is just hard in general because there are so many characters. Scientific notation (2.12e-9) is much better but also not practical for everyone. I think nanoBTC / nBTC and the various other SI prefixes will work fine in the future.

You should get the USD amount they show you when you click "sell" but I don't use coinbase to sell BTC so I can't confirm this. I've only bought BTC with USD (and things with BTC) and only on coinbase so I can't compare them to other sites. Their verification process is a pain if you've had multiple addresses in the past and/or don't have much of a credit history. That's not really their problem though.

You can't infinitely divide bitcoins though. The smallest unit is 1e-8 btc.

This isn't coinbase talking. Please read the linked post, it really has a better explanation.
Carrying a balance is useful when you want to be able to quickly trade back/forth between USD/BTC. Coinbase is not designed to (nor do they claim to) offer these services. Coinbase is more like a bitcoin store.
Trying to carry a USD balance and perform frequent trades on coinbase is like going down to your local currency exchanger and trying to play the USD/JPY market. It just doesn't make sense, you'd use an exchange platform to do that (like bitstamp, bitfinex, mtgox etc...).

If you use a wallet like electrum or multibit, you aren't required to download the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:31:55
For the latter to happen we would need either a new computing paradigm or a  flawed crypto implementation (this is unfortunately more common than one would like but you're not really guessing in that case). Brute-force guessing a private key corresponding to a given public key is just so absurdly unlikely the numbers are hard to express in a way that makes it clear how unlikely it really is. You can read about it on the wiki if you're curious.

Their website is surprisingly browser-specific. On my iPhone, since their app can't support bitcoin, I have to use their site on safari. It doesn't work on iOS chrome even though android chrome works fine.

Not as the current protocol is designed, no. You get out of it what you put in, security wise. More computational power used means more is required to break the blockchain, and more computational power means more electricity. If the coins were mined using less electricity, they would be by definition less secure.

Is it saying they're out of stock or just that you have to wait til Friday to receive the coins? If you aren't doing an instant buy then you need to wait til Friday to receive them regardless.

Getting USD into BTC-e can take a long time. International wires are slow and not cheap. The minimum international wire fee is $15 so you'd need to make a big purchase to offset that. Then you'd have to hope that by the time said big purchase goes through the price hasn't equalized or the fees will kill you.

I haven't even gotten it to *ask* me a question yet :/ I've had 7 different addresses over the past 10 years and have paid income taxes to 3 different states. Furthermore some of those were apartments and there's no field for apartment number or other address components.
Now that there's the instant 1btc option, I've given up on getting verified (after a week of trying every day).
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:25:23
You (or perhaps someone else if your private keys weren't secure) must've spent some BTC in the last 10 weeks. Your wallet only saw the balance back then and thus showed you a higher number.
When the qt client finishes downloading the most recent blocks, it should show you an accurate balance.
As to where the coins actually went, you'd have to look for other transactions from addresses you control. You can find these on blockchain.info too.
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:13:33
Right, I see I didn't think the question through enough. Good point :p
Related one though: if things equalize at a point with far fewer miners, it seems like this would concentrate the mining power into smaller and smaller groups of people (which is bad).

What's stopping someone with your password from logging in, changing the password, then verifying with their own valid information before taking the coins?
Of course the hacker's personal info is now in mtgox but all the records show is someone who knew the password for the account logged in and entered valid personal information. As far as mtgox is concerned, this person is the true account owner and you're just some guy who accidentally sent them some BTC.

Er... is the account less than 30 days old? And you're asking why the "account is older than 30 days" part isn't done yet?
On the site it says as one of the steps, "Buy some bitcoin and wait at least 30 days."
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:33:13
This is only one interpretation of "fiat currency." If you consider "fiat currency" to mean money with no intrinsic value (I do), then bitcoin IS fiat currency just like the dollar. This is not a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:15:43
Besides sending them to an address whose private key you destroyed, you can also send them in any transaction with a script that simply returns false. This transaction is provably unspendable and effectively destroys the bitcoins involved. No one will ever be able to spend them without performing some kind of successful attack on the network to modify the blockchain.
Of course if you perform such an attack on the network, bitcoins immediately become worthless (if you're detected).
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:04:18
Silly question, but did you copy/paste the address from bitaddress, or did you do something like write it down or copy it by hand?
If you did copy/paste it from bitaddress, I would say it's a bug but otherwise it's clearly a typo. The address encoding contains a checksum that will fail to match if the address is mistyped.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:09:12
It's not possible to do so reliably without using a coinbase-provided service like their website or mobile app.
You could add all of your coinbase receiving addresses to a watch-only wallet but coinbase is free to (and does) move your btc around between addresses just like real banks do. That's why the only reliable indicator is their own services.
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:46:46
Sounds like you did everything fine, he was just a sketchy customer. The person with cash *needs* to go first because of the nature of bitcoin. If he hands over the cash and you refuse to send, he can grab it back, call the cops etc... If you send him the BTC and he leaves, you can only hope LBC's escrow service works out in your favor (having never used LBC I'm not sure how it can work for cash transactions, how do you prove that they did / didn't hand over the payment?).
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:33:38
Some (most?) banks have a limit on the size and amount of ACH transfers you can make in a month or week (coinbase uses ACH transfers to move money to/from your bank acct). My limit is $6,000/wk unless I call them up and request that they increase it. Doing so requires some paperwork so I'm guessing you haven't done this.
Even if you have over $7k, the transfer will likely be rejected by your bank unless they have very generous limits.

Coinbase purchases use bank transfers, and if the transfer doesn't go through (say because you don't have enough money to cover it), they could be out a lot of money. The wait is roughly the time that it takes for the transfer to take place (+/- a day or less).
They do offer instant purchases if you verify your account and add a credit card.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:19:49
They might, but if the pool distributed their ill-gotten gains amongst the miners then they would have an incentive to stay proportional to how much messing around they were able to accomplish. I'm curious if this is a real flaw or I'm misunderstanding something in the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:07:13


Not quite. If you purchase 2btc now for $1100 ($550/btc) and then the price doubles to $1100/btc on Friday, they aren't going to charge you $2200. They'll just purchase 1btc with the same money you sent earlier for 2. They'll take the USD amount you spent originally and buy as many BTC as they can with Friday's prices.

**PRO TIPS!**
Read about split-key vanity mining here:  and here:  and don't accept a vanity address from anyone who doesn't use this method to generate the address. If you just accept any old vanity keypair from some guy online, you risk having any coins sent to your vanity address stolen.

Having a single receiving address doesn't seem like a problem to me. It's not like you can really purchase the sub anonymously anyway since the store has security cameras (unless there's a different reason it's a problem?).
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:53:03
If I remove the last few invalid characters from the link you pasted, it shows an address that has a pending transaction of 1.2BTC made with no transaction fee. I'm assuming you bought some BTC recently and this is the transaction for it.
You can see the estimated time to confirmation is 36hrs now, but this is just an estimate and can go up/down. Transactions with no fee can take a significant time (days) to get the first confirmation.
For a HW wallet: wipe the laptop and install a clean OS and bitcoin client. Never connect it to the internet (you can read about how to sign transactions without an internet connection), and back up at least the wallet.dat file regularly to another, safe hard drive.
You won't be able to properly view the wallet balance offline (this is fine). You can add any of the addresses in the wallet to a "watch-only" wallet on another internet-connected machine (blockchain.info's web wallet also supports this among others) to view the balance without exposing the laptop.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:49:47
My intuition is that you are wrong in this example but I can't point to anything (helpful I know :/).
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:58:02
Yes, you need to complete at least one BTC purchase, verify your account (click the button on their site, good luck) and add a valid credit card. You can then buy 1btc/week instantly, up to 10/week instant after you've waited 30 days.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:38:37
It's not like LBC where you send money and get BTC. You need to link your bank account before even starting to buy on coinbase. They *take* the money via ACH transfer as soon as you make the purchase (though the transfer takes up to 3 days, they do you a favor and buy the BTC immediately if they're able).
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:13:04
You lose privacy but otherwise no, it is OK. You need to be careful about where the change goes if you don't spend the whole balance in the wallet though. By default, the reference client will make a new address for the change, but you can disable this (losing privacy).

There is no such thing as a legacy system in this context, only one which stores bitcoin amounts incorrectly (they should not be stored as floating point values).

What I'm talking about has nothing to do with the exchange rate between BTC and any other currency. I meant the BTC transaction fees attached to every transaction. The question holds even if you pretend no other currencies besides bitcoin exist.
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:26:51
Ah I see, well then the question is moot as if bitcoin becomes popular enough that it persists until all the new coins are mined, the USD value could very well be high enough to compensate.

With the increases in hashing power and difficulty, you will spend more on the device than it is capable of mining before becoming obsolete (thus losing money). If the difficulty continues to steadily increase, the miner you buy now could be useless in a few months. You really have to spend tons to make your investment back.

You could reverse bitcoin transactions the same way you reverse cash ones (with a receipt). Merchants could even sign a digital receipt with private keys. If this isn't sufficient, then the same laws would outlaw cash as well.

It's not like banks have everything to lose and nothing to gain from BTC. People will always need a safe place to store their money, and paper wallets / cold storage are just not safe and simple enough for the average user. There's no reason existing banks can't become safe places to store your BTC private keys *and* USD.

Coinbase is not an exchange. Every time you buy or sell, it initiates an ACH transfer from/to your bank. These transfers can (and usually do) take at least 3 business days. The coins will generally appear about 30mins after the scheduled time listed in the transaction history.

Anyone who wants to offer vanity addresses as a service really needs to look up split-key vanity mining. Just generating the key pair and offering them both is entirely unsafe for the recipient (not criticizing you just pointing this out).
There's also a pool for this thing already (vanity pool) because 4-character alphanumeric prefixes are trivial but the longer ones get absurdly hard very fast. For example, I can generate a 1hape... address in about 20s on my 5yr old GPU, but my full username would take roughly 15 years to have a 50% chance of finding it on my machine by itself. ASICs won't work either because the hashing used to obtain an address from a public key is not plain SHA256 (it's sha256 and ripemd160).
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:03:01
It's really just logical. If people can buy a game for $60 in the US, I would expect that I could buy the same game in say Japan for ~¥6,000. Of course things have their prices in BTC match their USD value, if they didn't people would resell them until the price moved to adjust.
If you can buy a product with two currencies then (in an efficient market) the price in those two currencies should be equivalent based on exchange rate.
