banks are NOT ALLOWED, and people ARE ALLOWED. yes, people allowed to trade BTC as virtual goods  
Their assessments have revealed that bitcoin seems like a legitimate currency  again, just virtual goods can't label a product or service.

if you can't exchange a product or service use bitcoin, why I will invest a serials of digital number?

你同事都是白痴！不能流通 不能用来作为计价交换商品和服务，比特币就没有了支撑，你把比特币当商品买回去用来做什么？没有作为货币或替代货币的支撑，你买的比特币能涨价吗？剩下的就是一堆0和1的数字了。

thank you for your reply. yes, no one response. I know people will skeptical. Is there some way to guarantee the trade?
some items if you buy it from China you only pay 1/10 of the price in euro or us. I had investigated the delivery price. it's reasonable, for example, if you delivery 0.5kg from shanghai to US only pay less than 200CNY, only use few days or maybe just 48 hours. If some one want to try, I can pay it first, while you receive your package, then pay me.(of course only less value items)
even I charge 20% the total price you can save at least 50% for the things you buy. And I can give you advise for buying things from taobao; bargain for you; check the quality;pack for safety.
