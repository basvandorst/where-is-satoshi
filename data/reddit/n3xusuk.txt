It's true, I fit the graph to make the point. But this illustration also works when looking at a year or two worth of data.
I don't think we're crashing back down to $400, but $1600 is looking possible. We're in a text book bubble. 
My point is, this is a risky time, even more so than normal.  I've been burnt on cryptos a few times, and just wanted to advise caution.
If it keeps on going, bounces past $2700, I'll eat my hat.

Same :)

 is decent, but I don't think you're gonna get an account setup in time.  There will be another bubble in the future, next time ;)
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:50:00
Yup, agree with all that. Just need to wait a bit for the dust to settle.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:31:39
  ;)
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:10:27
Nicely timed ;)

Yeah, fair shout.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:09:01
Yeah, $1800 is looking about right, that would bring it back to the mean.  There is the despair stage though, were it could briefly drop lower.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:25:36
Think we might be hitting fear already...  
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:30:31
For those asking, $1800 would put us back near the mean.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:41:49
From there, we ride the waves back up to the next bubble, all things being well :)  
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:27:58
Yeah, I saw. Glad this got through to the top today though, people need to be aware.  I'd rather people not get burnt.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:22:52
Agree with all that. I believe one can be both though, and try make a decent living along the way :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:51:08
Yup, it's happening quick.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:55:59
And it will again. Just after some corrections, before continuing along the mean.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:14:07
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:17:50
Yup, feeling that...
