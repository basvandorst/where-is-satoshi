Do you know what timezone that the WhaleCalls bot is in?

The Twitter,
It looks like they're dealing in Dollars but the timezones are Hong Kong.

You should Google this. There is a LND process (software package) and it's other implementations that allow your computer to be visible on the Lightning Network.

Any site that has a BCash ticker is part of his media "empire", CoinTelegraph for example.

They're coming back from the Moon on a Spaceship at the moment, so they'll see the comment after that.

I remember watching the Joe Rogan podcasts from 2014 (Jan, Apr, Dec) when Andreas. Andreas must've been deep in debt back then. September 2016 he appeared again, likely getting better financially.

With the Paper Wallet, you can use Blockfolio, to monitor the price.
The bitcoin.com wallet is terrible on Android, I can toast marshmallows on my phone.

Forks happen when there is a software upgrade, or an ideological difference. BCash -&gt; Bigger Blocks, Bitcoin Gold -&gt; Decentralised mining with a different non-ASIC algorithm.
You can reclaim the new coins if you have access to a Private Key, hence the paper wallet or hardware wallet requirement.
According to Andreas: None of the coins are actually worth anything, it's the belief, the authority, that provides the value. Bitcoin has the greatest minds in crypto involved in its development.
Take all the YouTube comments with a grain of salt, the Hardware Wallet maker, might've paid this Channel for some promotional work. Jurisdictions, like the UK, require the channels to put "Paid Content/Promotion/Partnership" and "AD" in their videos. Look up Global Cycling Network's channel and you'll see the "AD" in the video thumbnails.

Sorry boys, I didn't listen to HODL.
I tried to Swim with Sharks, now I need to Dance with the Devil.

I have a tweet from around the same time, "BitCoin at €3, this is crazy", I didn't buy it then. Some guy retweeted it around late-October of this year.
I had to do the calculation, had I invested €600 back then, I'd be a Millionaire by late-October 2017.
I also have a terrible tweet from 2012 about Andy Carroll being a better signing for Liverpool than Sergio Aguero would be for Man. City. It got picked up in mid-2016 and I was getting slated in Quote Tweets for weeks.

When there is a software upgrade needed, or when there is an ideological divide. A Fork will occour. It happens on a specific block, and you the hodler will get an equal amount of each coin, if you are in possession of your Private Key at the time of the fork.
Bitcoin forked into Bitcoin and BCash, people who held Bitcoin on the time of the block got an equal amount of BCash. 
A Paper Wallet, gives you control of the private key. A site like Coinbase will credit your account, if they support the fork, as they don't give you access to your Private Keys.

Andreas also has books, you can get them on Audible too.

I had a similar tweet from early 2011, where I said that it was madness that BTC was at €3.

Looks like BitCoin Jesus got saved.
Charlie Lee and Rodger Ver's BTC vs. B2X Bet, in this tweet, is no longer valid.

Reddit needs a RemindMe Bot for BitCoin Prices.
Example: RemindMe BTC 100000

I feel that these "Vehicle Coin Charts" memes are a way of blowing off steam from the recent worring news, BGold, 2X, Flippening.
