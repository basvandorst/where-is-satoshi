Well, you can actually switch to English. I have bought some Bitcoin for my mom with such machine. Everything went smoothly. Moreover, if a person doesn’t have a wallet, it creates a new one with public and private key on the peace of paper.

Well, in Alza you can buy literally anything with bitcoin. You can find 10 bitcoin ATMs form General Bytes in metro stations like Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádraží. But you can also find ATMs from Bitcomat and WBTCB and more. Regarding this machine I’ve seen many in so called “Trafika”. I have been to Prague and other cities recently.
