Can we add this to the sidebar as a community rule?

I don't understand what this means, sorry.  Happy to have an honest convo with you about it, but it seems like your brigade of friends is very polarized on this topic

Thanks! The fact that I have -200 downvotes and everyone "disagreeing"^* with me has +200 votes pretty much told me that, but I wouldn't have cared/bothered to find the actual thread.  Hilarious as usual with these types.
\* This is especially funny because I'm not a Peterson fan. Just have actually taken the time to try to understand what he has to say. I actually state in my original post that I don't agree with him on any of it... Yet the brigades still attack lmao

milquetoast is kinda sexist, tbh

Why do you say this?  I've heard a lot of bad things about Peterson, and I certainly don't agree with him on a lot, but have you actually taken the time to listen to what he says as opposed to the strawmen created by his haters?
**Edit:**  Wow, [the haters who create the strawmen I mentioned]( above have teamed up to downvote me and (maybe) prevent my voice from being heard rather than refuting anything I've said (which was nothing, tbh... just asked a legit question) with anything resembling an actual argument.  lmao totally supports my original statement tbh.  Especially funny because I personally disagree with Peterson, I just want to see everyone get a fair shake, and I often see his views misrepresented.
