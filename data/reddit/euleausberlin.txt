Millions of poor voters (the sheep) and a few rich voters (the wolves). By buying corrupt politicians and media the wolves make sure that they get even richer, eating a few sheep on the way.
Yet the sheep keep voting for the wolves. A basic democracy (i.e. the people get to vote on every law change) could change this, truly independent media has to become a big thing first though.


I hate how this mantra is used so much. It demonizes democracy and is simply wrong, as there are more sheep than wolves.

Was downvoted last time I asked/stated this:
How hard would it be for e.g. the NSA or CIA to develop and manufacture a shitload of fast ASICs and 51+% Bitcoin? Sure it would cost a few billion $, which is not that much in the budget of gov agencies. This website calculates 51% cost at under 2 billion $:
That means Bitcoin needs way more hashpower before it can be secure of gov attacks. Keep that in mind when investing. Altcoins with complicated algos may prove more secure in the future, but then again you can make ASICs for anything.

But they (Valve) recommended users to buy zeevex cards to reload their steam balance. And now all of a sudden you can't do that anymore. Either Valve or zeevex are at fault, and if only morally.

Lesson learnt for sure. It was so convenient to use zeevex, I hope they change their mind again, but it seems most people just don't care about this. Also I have to wonder if it's even legal for them to do it.

The difference is, Paypal won't refund you if you sold a virtual item, i.e. an item you cannot hold it in your hand, like Steam gifts or bitcoins. Bullshit, I know.

As some of you may know, you can buy zeevex cards with bitcoins, e.g. on gyft.com. These cards could be redeemed for Steam wallet codes at zeevex.com, until two days ago. 
There's a post on this sub that states Valve forced zeevex to stop carrying Steam cards: 
Is that true? This sucks massively for me, still got 90$ on a zeevex card I cannot reddem on the item I want (Steam). I could buy EA money with it though, not that I'd want that, but I could...
 (does no more exist)
Also note that there are quite a few other btc -&gt; steamcard sites, why didn't you go after them but after zeevex, which is at least a real company? Also it was extremely convenient, bitcoin to steam wallet in less than a minute.
So Valve, please do one of the following things:
Accept bitcoin directly in Steam
Accept zeevex cards directly in Steam to charge up the balance
Allow zeevex to carry Steam wallet codes again
TL;DR: I just wanted to throw 50+$ at Steam but they forced a wallet code reseller to stop and now I'm forced to buy EA money or other useless stuff. Thanks Valve! :/
edit: Just found this, Steam advertising for zeevex cards directly in Steam: 
Looks like they simply changed their mind.

To be eligible for Seller Protection, you'll need to meet each of the following requirements:
    You must send the item to the shipping address on the Transaction Details page.
    You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner.
    The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped.
    (Example: a DVD is eligible but an MP3 file is not)
    Your primary residence, as listed in your PayPal account, must be in the United States.
    We recommend that you ship the item within 7 days of receipt of payment. 
    Or, if the payment is for pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, it must be shipped within the timeframe 
    specified in your item listing.
A paper wallet would be eligible, a bitcoin wouldn't be.

This ultimately shows that if a government/agency/bank/illuminati wants to destroy bitcoin, they could pull it off. Sure it would cost a few billions, not much in the budget of CIA or NSA e.g..
Quarkcoin ftw btw.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:52:35
Just think about how easy it would be for e.g. the NSA. A few billions into ASIC development and manfucturing and bam 98% attack! :D
IMO multi-algorithm coins are the future. Quark was a bit unfair to late adopters, Qubits seems to do it right.
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:50:22
Yeah but noone is going to sell you 5000 3TH miners, you'd have to develop and manufacture the ASICs yourself.

That is a dangerous mindset, as adoption of several altcoins is growing quickly. It's unlikely imo that Bitcoin will keep it's current status of *the* internet currency, instead it will be *an* internet currency. Which is a great thing and will lead to more innovation.
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:10:21
From my understanding, which might be wrong as I don't care enough to look into this too deeply, only authorized 2nd layer "nodes" and services will be able to pass transactions along to the real blockchain. Of course they won't do it for free.
It seems obvious that the loudest proponents of segwit will host such services and get rich(er) with the fees.
As I said I might be wrong, but that's my general understanding and the core team hasn't done much to correct that.
You attacking me as a propagandist from just proves how shitty the debate has become, any critique or even non-understanding is attacked as propaganda and fud. Almost like a cult. Check my history, never posted there.
People have lots of questions yet all you can do is attack them as "being against Bitcoin", which is bullshit. Educate people instead of attacking them.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:06:43
I don't want to be educated here. There needs to be a campaign educating the public, preferably without technical mumbo-jumbo.
Misinformation is spreading because people neither want to nor have the time to "look into it deeply".
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:22:31
Frankly SegWit is centralized bullshit that only increases profit for a few people.
edit: Seems I was wrong about what SegWit is. I blame the devs for only releasing technical mumbo-jumbo the normal user doesn't understand, making it easy for misinformation too spread.
The community being hostile to anyone who dares to not agree or even understand doesn't make it better in any way. Thanks to anyone who genuinely wants to educate instead of berate.

WTF?! In my opinion even transactions worth 5 cents should be possible without a too high fee, anytime. Calling those spam simply shuts out a huge part of the world population.
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:35:06
Are you always this salty?
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:11:57
That's a whole lot of mumbo-jumbo the non-technical user won't understand, especially those whose first language isn't English. I guess that's where most of the frustration comes from.
This point:


wasn't communicated nearly loudly enough btw, my understanding was that the blocksize wouldn't increase at all and any transactions beyond 1MB would have to go through the 2nd layer services everyone seems to be so keen on.
One thing it doesn't explain is why those 2nd layer services are necessary or a good thing in the first place. It also fails to explain what a segregated witness is.
So maybe a sticky "SegWit for Dummies" would help.
I still would prefer simply raising the blocksize limit to 2, 4 or 10MB, maybe make it dynamic like in other Cryptocoins. The possible longer verification times are a shitty argument considering Moore's law.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:09:37


And here I thought higher hashrate = higher security...
Moore's law is obviously valid when it comes to bitcoin mining, what has China got to do with it? Does Moore's law make electricity magically cheaper? Aren't the scamming US companies back in the day at fault for chinese companies getting a higher share of the pie?
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:36:40
And that just sounds like bullshit to anyone with an understanding of Moore's law.

Just the opinion of a small bitcoiner who doesn't own thousands of $ in BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:23:33
Time for segwit proponents to make clear to the public what segwit actually is. So far only users who know everything about how bitcoin works are able to learn what it is, because the info we get is highly technical, which the majority of bitcoin **users** isn't able to understand easily.

I first started with a 5770 but was too impatient to keep it running, getting a bitcoin took almost 5 days!
Later I discovered Litecoin and the Altcoin craze, mined 500,000 Quarkcoins while the interest was low (price was at 40-100 satoshis) and sold almost all at around 300. A week later the price was at 25000, I'd have had 150 btc, back then ~180,000€. Luckily was able to rescue a few stuck transactions (p2pool miners will know that problem), so I got 3btc or so out of it after all.

But to receive the money both persons need a bank account (which costs money each month). I doubt you can send money instantly to accounts of a different UK bank, not to mention weekends and holidays. Also international bank transfers are quite expensive and can take up to 7 days. Government agencies look at each transaction.
Bitcoin just has too many advantages, the banking sector won't be able to withstand it without changing drastically, which might happen, but even then bitcoin will be a big player in the industry.
