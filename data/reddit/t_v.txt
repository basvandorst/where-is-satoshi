i don't get the vibe that the decision makers at walmart that are in charge of making decisions about companies like eGifter are too concerned with customer experiences like that

certainly a possibility. i'm also just throwing out huge speculation. :-)

go download amazon or ebay apps and try buying something...
apple only requires a cut of purchases that extend the application itself.

regarding your actual question, a google search says that you can do so in their iOS app.
as far as what's probably easier goes, you can flat out buy cards for other people at their site/apps and all that jazz.

good point about the book being used outside as well (duh) but i think we're already "there" regarding other possibilities... i.e. purchasing digital gift cards from the amazon ios app and whatever things along those lines on ebay and such. 
the other side of this is that amazon is a competitor to apple in that regard so naturally there is a seriously fine line that the two are playing with. theres also other implications with eBooks and actual ownership and garbage there that likely makes apple pay closer attention.
here's a fun one:
11.13: "Apps that link to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the App, such as a "buy" button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book, will be rejected"
eGifter and these companies aren't providing mechanisms for purchases to be used in the app, they're purchases to be used WITH the app... hahaha.
the simple fact of the matter is that we won't have eGifter or Gyft or any of these companies around in iOS if this payment thing becomes a problem... there simply isn't that kind of margin in these cards. my take on it is that they all play with single digit numbers.

my take on the guidelines is that IAP integration is required for all purchases that directly extend the application, not just because they're 'digital goods'. I don't think theres any 'getting around' apple here.
think of it like amazon... you can make all the purchases you like on there (digital or physical) up until you get to the point of looking to purchase an ebook for consumption on your kindle iOS app... that they stop you from being able to do to avoid splitting revenue with apple.
the closest applicable point is 11.2:
"Apps utilizing a system other than the In-App Purchase API (IAP) to purchase content, functionality, or services in an App will be rejected"
i don't feel that a digital gift card (that isnt used solely in the app, it is also on your account on all the egifter web/mobile platforms) falls under any of those 3 categories.

actually it goes a lot higher. they have this insiders thing that if you pay $10 a year (first year free) you get MUCH higher discounts on a lot(not all) of the cards.
