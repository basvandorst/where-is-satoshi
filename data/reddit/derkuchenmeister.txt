Mpesa isn't a crypto back currency system, it came out 10 years ago or so. Also this wasn't my post I've completed some of my thesis work around these topics so I'm aware of both Mpesa and bitwala

Parts of Africa currently use Mpesa which  is a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone

If you look into it he accepted a plea from the German authorities that brought the case against him so that he could return to living a normal life

Kinda feels like because western nations have such well established financial systems that adoption of bitcoin doesn't provide enough benefits. Feels like Bitcoin is going to first have to take off in nations where the financial systems are not as secure or widely available. It feels like this may be the first technology where adoption in developed nations is slower than developing nations. That's all assuming Internet to those nations becomes well established in the coming year or two. Obviously this is just speculation but people from those countries have more reasons to use bitcoin that directly benefit their lives.

Haha i have spent 86% of my net worth on bitcoin, but realistically my full faith is with the tech behind it. If it fails I just hope my hyper awareness of the area helps me recover a small portion

What if you paid via some Internet method of payment? I mean what if you paid paypal for example to someone where it is easy to get and they send it to you?

I'm willing to lose everything over this. the old system is not better, I finally get to live by principles that can not be changed by a central authority. I trust computer science more than suits rigging forex markets. I will go down with the ship because it feels morally more correct than giving money to banks. Facts of life like this  I'm with gandhi, I want to be the change I want to see in the world.

I'm not looking to recoup losses if bitcoin fails, just be there to get in on the ground floor of the coin that comes after it

This is a bit misleading. This is only one part of what defines a good currency. A good currency satisfies 3 aspects,  unit of account,  store of value and medium of exchange. Bitcoin as a store of value is still in a a stage of uncertainty.  The listed positives of bitcoin are all part of a unit of account.

I wish I could place put options on paycoin

I see what you mean, I shared because I thought that one explained it clearly. I like the one you linked better, stuff is  confusing

"In economics, the monetary base (also base money, money base, high-powered money, reserve money, outside money, central bank money or, in the UK, narrow money) in a country is defined as the portion of a commercial banks' reserves that consist of the commercial bank's accounts with its central bank plus the total"

We have a lot to thank for from core, they've done a lot to make sure bitcoin doesn't fall apart or hastily add changes that threaten the future. But the moderation on this sub has been overzealous.... we don't need more censorship these days

Code does not equal law, just because someone signs doesnt mean they are satoshi and the opposite can also be true.

They can seize your bitcoin as well...

Hey im in new jersey and the site is blocked for me, anyone know if this applies to NJ as well? Im central nj and far enough way from NY
@_date: 2017-04-18 15:33:54
There is also bitpay
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:13:46
Still more then where it's accepted in nj. Plus most of my time was spent in kreuzberg, which is the hub as far as I am aware 
@_date: 2015-04-18 15:12:00
God I miss berlin. Would love to come back to it now that bitcoin is so prevalent there 
@_date: 2016-10-05 21:18:18
Boo blockstream
@_date: 2016-10-06 08:30:22
Well I'd venture a guess that I have a different thought regarding blockstream then you. Which in a universe of just you and I shows that certainly, I think for myself

Any chance he would be interested in starting a company similar to that of western union, but with bitcoin and obviously cheaper for the customer? I'd love to work with someone who knows the location 
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:18:04
This may very well be fake but he brings up a good point, is capital gains the only tax one needs to worry about?

Anyone know how I could use popcorn time without worry of getting another email from my cable provider? Used it one time and instantly got an email. I'm on pc

Keep up the excellent work! Would love to invest in it if that ever becomes an option!
