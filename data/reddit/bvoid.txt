You got i all backwards. There is a big difference between a computer being ON and a computer running at 100% CPU. 
Well, you must be trolling. So I'll leave it here. Please be trolling.

No. It's exactly 244139.48158254.

But I do not see any withdraw options for people in Europe? MtGox got my IBAN and SWITF and made a deposit. Can I do that at TradeHill?

Please turn it off. You will make LESS than 10 cents a per 24 hours of non-stop mining (on deepbit) and your computer uses way more power with a CPU at 100%. Your are loosing money and wasting energi.

Oh, then I'm sorry. But you computer uses little electricity when ON and not doing any work. When it works at 100% CPU it uses way more power.
I'm very sure it uses more power than the 10 cents per day (and that is high; it's more like 3 cents per 24 hour). So you are actually using more money on power than you're getting bitcoins.
In a week you will have 0.01 bitcoin that you will be able to sell for 25 cents. Is that worth the extra power comsumption you think?
EDIT: My graphics card 6950 makes 325000 khash/s. That is a bit more than your 700 khash/s. So please reconsider leaving it on.

Do you have more than 0.01 BTC on you account? Have you made 3 payments the last 24 hours?
@_date: 2011-06-15 14:17:15
I'm not sure you understand Bitcoin.

But what about all the information you put on reddit? Your personal videos on youtube showing your family? Is that not worse than someone knowing an abitrary Bitcoin address with NO attached identity other than your nickname on reddit?
The worst privacy concern you have is in fact your reddit username that easily leads to twitter, youtube and the names of your closest family.
Not trying to be a creep, you just need to keep things on proportion.

Still not worth it. What is your hash rate?

Those are all pretty bad. Sorry.
