Lengthy article but well written. Bitpay is a centralized visa. Its the VISA of bitcoin. I send 2 bitcoin to this person in south wales and they send me what I was promised. I dont need VISA. A company like BitPay doesnt help the merchants understand the underlying technology. The execs worked in banking with the federal reserve. They catalog private information of merchants and customers. I dont understand why companies like this and coinbase are supported and defended when theyre clearly conformed to the traditional model, far removed from the disruptive decentralized model. Im very ignorant and kind of dumb, but whats the appeal? How is Bitpay more good then bad?

Satoshi stated early on that mining would become centralized to farms of machines. This is no issue, its right on track friend. Spending my bitcoin is satisfying. The vast majority of US dollars are held by a small group, very disproportianate to the population. What exactly are you trying to say? Can you not see the implications of the bitcoin system? "The flow of funds is being supplied by cybercrimes"  makes you sound uninformed to me. Im glad your here.

Read some [papers]( and see if its something you can get behind. Bitcoin used to be at $30, then crashed down to $6...... just saying, take control.

Dont accept it. Dont use Bitpay. A fluctuation in price isnt a big deal month to month for me, however, if I have 50,000,000 USD invested thats now worth 33,000,000.... you see where im going. Accept it if you believe in it, but I wouldnt if I didnt believe in it.

Yes, this is the best option as the original owner might not even bother checking this wallet anymore if its been compromised. No sense in send bitcoin to a dead address.

Agreed. r/bitcoin enjoys the circle jerk thinking of bitpay as theyve done something magical. Ill send you ten thousand bitcoin, you receieve it, frictionless. I send you ten thousand bitcoin through bitpay, WOAH, were gonna have to halt this transaction, regulatory instruments now prevent us from blah blah, upgrade your account however to business basic to raise paywalls to receive your money, as you said its ONLY three hundred dollars for the first month. But say this, and get downvoted to hell by twelve year olds, who watched the st petersburg bowl bitpay ads who are enjoying their circle jerk. -213 points for me

Posts continually get removed. Threads deleted or removed from the front page. For people who believe in decentralization, there sure isnt alot of it around here. Other accounts of mine have been banned for reasons I dont find worthy of it e.g. stating privacy policies from the coinbase website. 
For one, I think calming down is necessary.  I dont support XT. I believe it was Satoshi who wrote that post just two hours after Mikes announcement on the mailing list.
I do appreciate all the moderators efforts seeing as this is a voluntary gig on reddit.

Peter Todds latest contribution to the dev mailing list is evidence to the contrary.

Lol fuck bitpay

The core protocol cannot be "hacked" the network is distributed. A users wallet can be hacked, because all you have is an alpha numeric key which tells the network which satoshis belong to your key. If she has bigger things going on, which she probably does, just let it go for now.
