Bitwala. A number of cards like Bitwala do not convert on the fly. Instead you top-up the card with Bitcoin which they immediately convert to FIAT. So I'm loosing FIAT rather than Bitcoin. Bitwala emailed me with a link to a PDF form to download, fill in, then send on to Wavecrest. And there is the first problem. PDF not editable, you have to print off &amp; fill in manually, then scan &amp; email to Wavecrest. I do not posses a printer. So I have just emailed Wavecrest to ask them what I can do. I'm not expecting a reply.

Oh you are a happy boy. May be you should use the other shitcoin :-)
I have made a number of transactions over the past few days. Got into the very next block for roughly $7.50. Your also have segwit as an option I believe. I'm fed-up with hearing bullshit from people who obviously support the other shitcoin. If you don;t like btc move along, use something else. Merry Xmas :-D
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:15:32
It's being handicapped because of spam caused by followers of another coin. There is very little wrong with the Bitcoin protocol. We also have lightning to look forward too which will speed things up dramatically. Also RSK is on the way. I do agree that the fees should be a lot smaller, but don't blame the protocol or Core, blame the spammers, their the reason it's high. They are doing it to try &amp; make people like you use the other shitcoin.

To answer your question " what is IMMO? "
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:22:26
If you have a better idea I would be more than happy to hear about it. There is not a hope in hells chance of getting 95% consensus for segwit. Yet it is needed. Core have previously stated that a 2mb block increase is on the cards, but segwit needs to be implemented first. Miners just want things all their own way. It's their way or no way, without compromise. Without segwit no LN. So in point of fact miners are cutting their nose off to spite their face.
@_date: 2017-02-12 10:28:07
Not sure about that. Maybe one of the core devs could chip in to answer that question as I would like to know as well. This strategy would effect the btc price. Newly mined coins would increase supply, so would naturally apply downward pressure on the price. If no one sells though we would not be impacted, as price would recover once segwit has been adopted.
@_date: 2017-02-13 08:25:42
Yes people could do this, it's another hoop to jump through though. If all segwit supporters did this, would it not also grind the network down to a halt. I say this because the small number of segwit supporting miners might not be able to process all of the transactions. Personally I'm up for doing anything that gets us out of this ridiculous dead lock.
@_date: 2017-02-12 11:02:29
It's true that a lot of segwit support would be required, my guess would be at least 50% of btc users. Unless big blockers are prepared to keep buying all the freshly mined coins every 10 minutes the result would be the same. Miners would not make enough profit to pay their bills &amp; stay in business. It's a gamble, but it might force their hand.
EDIT: I'm also in favor of bigger blocks, but we have to start somewhere.
@_date: 2017-02-12 10:08:37
If people need to sell btc to put food on the table, then they have invested to much money in btc. But to answer your point. Yes, effectively a strike on transactions. Miners would not be able to hold out for long as their electricity bills are huge. It would also effect other businesses within the economy, who would then also apply pressure on the miners to adopt segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:27:50
If a Bitcoin ETF gets approved, in know way does this automatically mean that wall street are going to pile in on day one or any day after that. I would be very surprised if they did, but equally very happy if they did.
PS: Not trying to FUD. I'm a long term hodler &amp; have been buying for the past 3 years.
@_date: 2017-02-12 09:49:17
You are missing the point. I mean freeze transactions. If no one is buying or selling then the miners can not make any money because they would not be able to sell their newly mined coins. Therefore adopt segwit so people will buy their coins or go bust.
@_date: 2017-02-12 10:40:22
Actually thinking about it a hard fork would make no difference. If we continue not to buy or sell any coins the end result would be the same. Miners would go out of business.
@_date: 2017-02-12 11:53:08
Yes greed is always an issue. However, you can only buy/sell if there are market makers. If no one is buying or selling, they can't make anything. No doubt there would still be people buying &amp; selling, not everyone one would be prepared to strike. I can't help but think that it would make things difficult for day traders though. Their best option would be to just short the market, which again would hurt the miners. Cheap coins results in the same thing. Miners do not make enough profit to stay in business. A strike, if done correctly could be check-mate.
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:28:32
Really. Perhaps you could explain why governments have fallen in the past. They only have power for as long as the people say they have power. As soon as the people have had enough of their government pushing them around they are toppled. A government can not function without the co-operation of the people. They same is true for bitcoin. You can have as many miners as you like, if no one or very few are using bitcoin the miners will go the same way as bad governments have in the past.

Yes you would have to wait for some confirmations to take place. It's all automated though once you have put the exchange in motion. Just leave everything running &amp; go watch some tv. I actually left the house for a while, came back to everything being completed &amp; btc in my wallet.

no, it was a contract error at their end. they are aware of this &amp; have stated that they will be sending the coins over manually, but as yet they have not done so. just after that error they took a number of coins offline so obviously had a serious error their end. the coins are back online but I still have not heard back from them.

@_date: 2017-08-07 07:30:09
From my experience it would appear that there is some readjustment at least to the down side if the price falls, not sure what would happen if the price rises. The price I was originally offered did change slightly to the down side once the exchange had taken place. Their FAQ states that they charge 0.5%. They work they same as shapeshift, so they try to get the best rate off of the exchanges, then add a small fee for themselves. Hope this helps!

Switching to another provider is something I am considering. Just thought I'd see whats going on with coinbase. Seems strange, I can only assume that they have lost their UK banking partner for some reason. Thanks for sharing info will consider Bitwala, also been thinking about Xapo.

Yeah when I started a few years back a used Bittylicious. It's a good reliable basic service. I wanted something a little more slick. Moved to Circle, stopped using them when they stopped btc support, moved to coinbase &amp; coinbase just seem to be having lots of problems, Will probably move to either bitwala or xapo. Getting fed-up with switching, but I guess thats how it goes :-)

I'm not sure why chrome could be causing this issue, but at this stage it would look to be the culprit. If so then my apologies for raising concerns.

Yeah. I have, and I always will be a supporter of the core team. I do wish though that they would change the POW algo. That would save a lot of fucking about by doing so. These large miners are really just mining for FIAT because they cash out most of their BTC. Bring mining back into peoples homes, that's what I say. I'd happily fire up my old PC again for that.

Thanks for your time &amp; conversation!
I hope you do not think that I'm trying to promote alts because I'm not. I have and always will be a core supporter. Just interested in understanding Bitcoins internals a bit better. When people stare at a problem for as long as Core has you sometimes overlook simpler solutions. It's also possible that through trying to overcome complex problems you just end up making them even more complex, which in turn can lead to unreliable software and/or hardware. Kind of like you can't see the wood for the tree's. Anyway thanks again for your help &amp; conversation. Have a great day!

Could not wait so I've read it already. So, if I understand correctly, if the block time were to be reduced, the Auditors would have a great deal of difficulty keeping up with their work. In affect creating a backlog, which would suggest that the greater the block time, the less issues there are likely to be processing transactions. Would that be correct?

I guess that's a possibility. Thanks for the reply!

ok now I understand. So is it the particular POW algo that's at fault here. I ask because quite a few alts use significantly shorter block time intervals. Do they get around this issue by simply using a different algo?

Thanks for this. I have looked at some of this info previously &amp; I'm not sure if HMRC actually know what they are talking about. I've also watched an internal video from HMRC which I found on youtube, specifically about crypto trading. I know that within some of this info they stated that crypto to crypto trades were a taxable event. However speaking to one of there technical advisors today he actually agreed with me that it would not be. At least initally from a taxable profit point of view. If anything trading for example btc to eth would initially go down as a small loss because of the fees charged by the exchanges. It's all ridiculous. I'll just do what I think is right and leave it at that. By applying the same tax rules to crypto trading as they do stock trading, their basically trying to put a square peg into a round hole.

So how do you determine the value of that extra btc after the trade has been made and would the amount of tax you pay on that trade change over time as the value of btc changes? If the taxble value chages over time based on the value of btc then I guess I would need to just put as profit for now the amount of extra btc, then at the end of the tax year calculate that amount of btc profit into fiat?

Prior to reading your comment I've just had a long chat with the tax man here in the UK. Basically any profit is taxable regardless, so using a stablecoin is still a taxable event. You are right about tax obligations remaining the same. What ever the btc profit at the point of trade stays the same regardless of the btc price in the future. Working out taxes in going to be a complete pain in the ass. Traders also have to take into account exchange fees, plus work out what fees they had to pay in order to move btc around in the first place. How the hell a day trader or high frequency trader will deal with this I do not know. It's giving me a bloody headache.
