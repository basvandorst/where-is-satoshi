Really? You can't think of a single thing in the entire world that *won't* be revolutionised by Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:31:10
I'm as uninformed as you.
@_date: 2014-08-26 23:43:30
For one thing, it's not going to revolutionise trading in countries with no electricity or technology.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:03:49
Mod, not admin.
@_date: 2014-08-27 02:42:15
That was bad wording on my part. I meant areas.
@_date: 2014-06-11 04:16:56
That's the joke, yeah.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:04:43
He's not an admin, he's a mod.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:59:01
Yes it fucking is.
@_date: 2014-08-26 23:58:31
Some people don't even trade with physical currency. They won't adopt Bitcoin anytime soon, even with hardware wallets.
Either way, there are still loads of things that won't be revolutionised by Bitcoin. It might revolutionise *trading* in general, but a lot of industries won't be impacted at all.

Appreciate the help, but I just checked and javascript is enabled.
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:18:25
Thanks :)

I'm a New Zealander, I'm assuming Bitstamp will be all good?
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:43:55
Is there an equally reliable and cost effective service?
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:39:26
haaaa you got me
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:42:06
You realise that that's the customer service/support number, right? You'll just be complaining to the wrong person.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:27:49
Ah, ok then.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:00:53
Why would anyone use the service then?
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:32:50
I don't think it can, but then there's no real accessible filesystem on iOS. If you jailbreak it's very easy to set up a kind of My Documents folder and share over bluetooth but you can't on stock iOS unless it's built into the specific app designed to view or edit the filetype.

Apple won't even notice that you aren't giving them money. They don't give a shit. Good luck 'showing them what the Bitcoin community is made of'.

What happens if someone finds your reddit password and gifts themself all your bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:37:37
Alien Blue does the same, but it works much more smoothly and seamlessly. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:35:19
Oh no! How will Apple survive when hundreds, literally *hundreds* of people stop purchasing their products?
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:32:21
That's nice of you! I suppose I'll have to set up a wallet now :)

When most people say they're going to boycott something, they follow through until it's inconvenient and then forget about it. I highly doubt that Apple will change its mind about this issue because of this post.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:43:14
Oh, I didn't realise you could have multiple wallets. Ignore me.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:20:17
I didn't say they would?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:15:32
There are loads of apps in the App Store that will allow you to send images. You can send other types of files (presentations, mp3s, etc) with Airdrop if you have a more recent device.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:38:14


Yes you can...
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:39:20
So brave.
