I just bought the ledger as well..  took me a few minutes to setup.  But once you connect the ledger to your PC - then the wallet comes up and tells you to unlock it - you need to press both buttons on the ledger when you’re under the Bitcoin icon - this will unlock it.  When the wallet opens - you’ll be able to get a receive address which you put in the send field on coinbase.  You don’t transfer directly gdax to walllet.  You withdraw Bitcoin from gdax to coinbase btc wallet.  Then from coinbase you send btc to the receive address on your ledger.

Like I did - sold at 16.5 and gobbled up $5k worth at $13.9k..   I love it!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:30:21

I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 10 years ago (im 42 now).  I had surgery initially to remove 12 inches if my small intestines, and started Remicade afterwards.  I have been in deep remision for over 9 years now. I get Remicade drip every 8 weeks for the rest of my life or until there is a cure.  Without insurance, it would cost around $6000 / session.  With insurance, it comes out to about $900, and Remistart, a program to help Remicade patients with their costs, takes care of about 80% of those costs.   You should look into something like that for the medicine she is on if available.

Seriously.. what the fuck!   everyone who got screwed will only feel better when everyone else get's screwed??  Fuck that!!

I realize that BTC will go up to $30K, $40K and beyond...  i really just wanted my initial investment out.   I will have no regret!  I have already accepted that selling 1 btc will mean a loss of lots at some point.. but i have another 1 and some ltc.. and just gonna let it ride!!  
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:14:22
I should have said - when it dipped to $18.5k. - to me - that’s a freakin steal right now.. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:47
i don't know shit about futures.. but not only and i hodling my current bitcoins, but going to gobble up more if it does DIP!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:45:25
People who are saying it's going to crash are just bitter that they didn't invest early..  There will be dips, we all know that...
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:11:20
Think BIG!!    $20K - $30K - $40K per bitcoin!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:39:58
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:46:08
Thanks for letting us know you want a crash to happen so you feel better.

Point 1 - yes, it will most certainly go above $17K again.  When, maybe in the next week, maybe before or after a dip, not sure.    Point 2 -  if you are so worried about $100 when buying BTC, maybe playing around with BTC is not for you.  Only invest what you can afford to lose when it comes to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:06:05
I pumped another $7500 in at $18.3k and I consider it a steal!!!!  
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:46:51
Better call -1800Bitcoin.  They can help you.   Just Kidding - I have no idea.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:00:49
excellent point!

Since my initial investment.. i have been staring at the screen watching the prices..  ya know, being really unproductive at work.  Most of it was gut, and then i started using gdax with limit orders. This REALLY helped as i could put sell limits for overnight when i was asleep.  It would dip, my purchase would go through and it would be back up to where it was before I went to sleep.  Also at work, i would watch it dip a few hundred, then go back up a few hundred.  As I said, I got pretty luck (very lucky) with timing.  I truly believe it will go up, WAY UP.. but i wanted my initial investment back.  Today, I pulled the trigger.  Yes, I will probably be missing out on profits, but I really feel better knowing that when i look at my account now, it's pure profits.   I really hope everyone does well!!

I dont understand what "hold" is.  Did you mean "HODL"?  :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:30:49
I agree that it will hit $20K no doubt.. not sure by 12/16...  it may peak then dip, but sustained may take a LITTLE longer..  it WILL hit $20K though!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:56:07
Hey never too late to buy in - i got in at $8K and i am so glad i did...
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:57:00
That's pretty much the way i look at it.  Look.  I KNOW I could have not sold it, and in a month, it may double.  I made my wife happy by taking my initial investment out, and now I watch my profits grow. Happy Wife, Happy Life  :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:13:27
What do you want me to do?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:42:43
DOESN'T MATTER... BUY and HODL!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:26:57
Good for you buddy!!  It really does feel good.  Hope the BEST for you!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:43:35
GO rub one out.. by the time you're done, it will be back to up $19.5K  :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:26:48
All i can say is, I was asking the same question at $8K.. and i bought in after speaking to someone who KNOWS what they are talking about.   I bought in and am glad I did.   I believe (or my friend does as well as many others) that bitcoin will go to $25K, $30K and beyond eventually.    Be prepared for dips and don't panic sell.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:23:33
Damn right that was the PERFECT time to buy!!!!   As Fat Joe says "I'm all the way UP"  :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:57
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:26:29
AH, i think i knew that but i was questioning whether if i invested 17.5K and took out 17.5K, do i still pay taxes?  Oh well.. i cant complain.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:03:33
I have a question.  If you knew back then what you know now, you would have held the BTC and not sold or bought other items, because the value increased so much.  So why would you ever buy something with the BTC now, if you believe the value will go up in the future?
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:04:11
This is exactly what I have been doing - many times a day.. I sell high , then rebuy lower (maybe only $200 swing in BTC value)for the same amount of $$ as the sale gaining about .01 BTC per trade.. it’s all about increasing my BTC balance.  You have to be patient though. Don’t get spooked when it shoots up a little - wait for inevitable decrease for your buy to be filled..   I went from 3.8 BTC to 4.8 BTC in about 1 month this way.  When it shoots up high - I will sell just enough to cover taxes..  rinse and repeat!    Yeah baby!!  The best part about it is you can do it at anytime .. hodling is great.. but chipping away at small sells and buys will increase your BTC balance during the slow times!!

Good luck on that.....
