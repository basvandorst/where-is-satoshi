Just to clarify it does NOT say "Bitcoin barely accepted anymore" in dutch.
It says "Bitcoin still accepted hardly anywhere".
Overall the article shows a very high level of ignorance and lack of knowledge as we have come to expect from governments.
It actually says "the software" can't be trusted because there is no certification and therefore the integrity of transactions can't be guaranteed.

I am unable to login with my encrypted mnemonic passphrase.
Unecrypted works but when trying the encrypted one the app says its invalid.
But is does work in the chrome app so it is valid.
