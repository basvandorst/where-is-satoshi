Buying and waiting. Becoming wealthy is no longer depending on luck or corruption. It's just time. When bitcoin reached 1usd did it stop in increasing in value? Why should it stop at 100k? Why at 1 Million. Why should it stop? People will not stopping to lose their coins. Bitcoin is the rarest asset on earth. You don't know how much gold is in the ground. You don't know how much oil is in the ground. You know nothing. But you know there are 21m btc. Buy now. Never regret. Live like a poor man, save btc. Buy things you need. Not things you want. Things you need must be cheap. Things you want must be expensive. Rethink your attitude towards your consumption. Stop buying things you don't need. Buy bitcoin, rent everything else. No house. Rent a flat. Buy a car. Just in case you have to leave the country. Put all your saving in btc. Live poor with everything you need. No worries, happy life. Bitcoin and God is all you need.

They need 2 world wars to get in position where they are now, and all will be destroyed by some lines of code. 
Go ₿ 
Never listen to someone who says a single man can not change the world.
If you want to change the world there is no need to go voting. Do it. Maybe Nakamoto Satoshi never went voting once and he changed the game.

With Bigger blocks blockchain would become to fast too big

Maybe it's an atm which accepts 0 conf transaction. 
Seems like they send the bitcoins to an atm with a low fee. Cashed out. And made a new transaction with higher fees to themself.
They shouldn't accept 0conf deposits. It's so easy to cheat with that. They should wait for at least 1 confirmation to let the money out.
Lesson learned

No it's not. Bit if you have a slow computer like a rbp3B+ torrenting the chain is a good option. Like the raspiblitz also does torrenting blockchain. If you sync with bitcoin core it would need weeks. And many nodes do not want to connect to you because they don't serve archival nodes which are way behind
