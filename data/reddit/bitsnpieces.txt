Pull your head in, fuck face. I don't tell you how to organise the credit cards and 'arrogant assholes anonymous' membership cards in your scabby fiat currency wallet.
Anyway - thankyou for your valuable and informative contribution :/

I'd like to announce a shipping date too. 
However, it's completely arbitrary, will most likely change, and just like BFL it means absolutely nothing!
@_date: 2013-03-22 05:59:20
hahaha! Totally picturing you sitting there munching on a taco... "you ain't from round here are ya boy?!"
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:53:28
I got in at $12AUD, then i got in again at $15, $20, $30, $40... Today ima get me some at $55. hopefully. 
cant. stop. buying. bitcoin

WOW! Who is that ignorant wanker scoffing his box off in the background?
He's not even being skeptical, just pessimistic!
I wonder if he'd still be such a cocky prick if a few of us showed him the balance in our mtgox accounts!
As an aussie, i'm glad this sort of bullshit doesn't make it to our TV screens.

spendbitcoins.com worked great for me in the early days (11AUD/btc), but they charge 10% fee - so the $1.10 fee was almost negligible.
Now you'll be paying an extra 10% of the wildly fluctuating prices. Which is not negligible.
You will get your coins within a couple of hours though - which beats joining the massive Mt.Gox queue at the moment.
Depends how badly you want to get in...
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:12:54
Yeah good point. Back in the day when btc was virtually worthless it must have been an almost common occurence.
Bet those people are spewin' now! (not to mention the guy that ate (todays value) a $640,000 pizza!)
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:40:49
It makes perfect sense actually. Blockchain wallet allows you to archive any old addresses, then sweep the private keys to another active address within your wallet. In this case, the value was so low (less than AUD0.000000001) that it wouldn't allow allow it. 
Anyway - I'm not here to justify myself, I'm asking a question...
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:46:19
*Yeah, we're...*
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:24:49
It's so hard to tell mate... 
That would be premature speculation, and we all know how embarrassing that can be.
Especially when everyone on reddit is watching.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:19:08
Well said, my thoughts exactly.
But alas, given how much money Mt.Gox would have made in the last 24hours on all those micro-transactions - I have a feeling we would be bashing our heads against a wall trying to get them to implement it...
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:33:30
it means nothing cos you drew a green line on it?
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:03:42
Logically and realistically, No, they can't.
The core of the bitcoin algorithm doesn't (and never will) change. That is the whole point.
Think about this, would you spend 5 million dollars on shares knowing they were only worth 1 million dollars, just so you could claim monopoly? 
I think you're misunderstanding the concept of btc. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:48:52
FFS. Really? See the 'search' bar? This question has been asked and answered DOZENS of times. This sub is turning to a steaming pile of rhetorical blabber.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:44:25
Good call. Did you manage to pick any up at around the $60 mark?
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:40:27
Is there somewhere you can view 'deceased' wallets and their value? Had a look on blockchain and couldn't see anything obvious.
Would be interesting to see the cumulative value of coins that have been wiped out of circulation.

Sweet baby jesus!
You are a horrible man, and i love you for it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:34:41
Wouldn't it make more sense that Mt.Gox put a restriction on the time between trades, rather than the value?
Something like 5 minutes would do it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:36:07
Why are all the 'parties' that you believe could mount a response to this scenario, synonymous with criminal and underworld activity?
Net nerds, crypto-enthusiasts and redditors would surely have a greater combined knowledge and influence on the bitcoin network, than 'la famiglia' adopting it at a whim.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:10:11
Luckily, I already have more than enough btc that i don't need to buy anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:13:52
news.com.au is confused about journalism in general. I used to keep screen captures of their incorrect spelling, bad grammar, and incorrect facts, but gave up after a week because you can find an error in EVERY one of their articles. abc.net.au/news all the way
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:38:15
How about getting someone who is fluent in English to proof read these releases, before release?
My grammar nazi brain almost exploded.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:02:41
If you want you can go and mine right now with CPUs, GPUs or FPGAs, but your influence on the networks hashing power would be minute and un-rewarding (meaning it would cost more to mine than you you would see in profit, ie: you would end up with net loss)
The whole point of bitcoin is to have an algorithm that adjust difficulty accordingly so that no single person or entity can control the network...
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:40:35
Good point.
10 lots of $0.1 fees is the same as one $1.0 fee.
The volume is what would have had them last smiling night.
I'd like to see a time restriction between trades, that'll iron out those annoying micro transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:46:34
Saw that on gumtree this morning.
Good luck to your mate! (although he's aiming at a very niche market - People that want to live in Australind, AND people who know how bitcoin works)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:35:48
Have you far decided even we us them purple monkey dishwasher?
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:36:37
news.com.au isn't really news - At best, it's a bunch of speculative information compiled with terrible grammar by a bunch of amateurs that call themselves journailsts.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:49:04
Nothing. It means absolutely nothing. Just like most things published on news.com.au

At work. Pretending to work. Trading.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:12:21
Nope, mines fine... 
Luckily for me, i even forgot about an old buy order for 20btc at $101AUD.
I woke up quite happy this morning.
But that doesn't help you. Sorry.
@_date: 2013-03-21 07:27:32
yeah, i agree with that... but, WHERE do they go? 
The fractions of bitcoins still exist, and cannot be destroyed.
Hypothetically, Imagine in fiat currency if I got a dollar coin and melted it down and turned it into an earring. The gold coin still exists, just not in a usable/tradeable form.
