Rumors and fear of regulation from China, it seems.

Haha can do!

Serves them right, though. Coinbase needs to pay attention to the white hat hackers with good intention.

Considering many counties transaction fees are higher, and the value of their currency may inflate exponentially more than the dollar many of us are use to, yes.

I've been talking to my 10 year old brother about Bitcoin since I've gotten into it a couple months ago. He is fascinated by the idea and always wants to hear what I'm doing with it.

Or just a Satoshi. I think we should stop referencing Dorian, even if he is Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:17:54
Maybe because of DISH, maybe because of some investors. Either way, I'm glad I started mining.
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:50:48
Buy coins and miners.
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:02:23
Yeah send some my way!
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:24:49
Exactly what I was thinking.

I've been using this app for a while now and love it. The Pocket Casts developers have a good sense of humor as well.
@_date: 2014-04-23 13:46:43
mBTC and uBTC works for me. I get that some people wont understand the universal principle around "milli" and "micro" units, but it's not that hard.

I feel good about mining on Eclipse now, it's not even in the top. Lets get people off this pool. Eclipse is a good alternative and has been more profitable for me than Slush.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:34:12
It doesn't matter, you're thinking in the context of right now, and not what may happen in a week or month. There's no way in hell I'll stop mining. 
PS, I'm running an AntMiner S1. Made $25 the past two days, not too shabby. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:20:32
El oh el you can send any of your BTC my way if you want to, I don't mind. If you have any.
@_date: 2014-04-23 20:44:47
No you're right, and yes people have ridiculously high amounts of money in Bitcoin's. What you need to know is that this is the most revolutionary system of transactions in history, and it won't hurt your computer. Granted, you probably still don't want to waste all that computer power for others gain. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:19:38
I use Mycelium as my main mobile wallet client, but it desperately needs a UI overhaul. Bitcoin Wallet has excellent design, but lacks some major features I need.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:43:17
I still don't see how this is possible. There has to he misinformation somewhere. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:10:36
You have done a good deed. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:20:06
Multisig transactions require a third (or more) party to sign a transaction before it is final. Therefore somebody could be in the middle to ensure that both parties received what they were suppose to and can release the funds once this is verified.

Apple Pay will be a temporary win that will inspire merchants to accept all NFC payments. From there, Google Wallet will take over due to Android market share. Finally, this will get people use to paying with their phone which will make bitcoin seem much less foreign.
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:27:00
I'll gladly take your BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:23:21
Nobody is being forced, but if people are afraid they will lose their investment, they will probably sell.
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:15:32
Very nice!
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:19:40
I've got 4 running myself. :)
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:05:28
That is nice, and easily managing multiple addresses is also great, but the design is horrid in my opinion. It's hard for me to recommend Bitcoin Wallet because of these features, but I always do due to it's quality design.
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:46:42
Yes, first off, utilizing Android's Navigation drawer is much more pleasing to the eye than swiping tabs. Second, the buttons and interface elements done seem very Android-ish at all. If you want to keep the design that way, that's fine, but at least use the Android keyboard for entering in prices. Third, straight up copy the interface for sending funds from Bitcoin Wallet. I hate to say it like that, but they have it down. It looks like Android, it looks beautiful, and it's intuitive. I don't like not being able to change my sending address once I select one. Currently I have to back out to the main view, reclick send and pick the correct address. I can continue if you want?
In fact, I just found the source on github. I think I'm going to take a stab at some of the design elements here soon.
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:57:46
Thank you for this. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:06:13
This still does not explain how he has MORE Bitcoin's than he started with. I'm extremely curious as to how this happened.
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:37:42
I have been using Electrum and it's currently my main wallet. However, I did start that wallet by importing my private key from Multibit, so I assume it's not protected by my seed. A big concern of mine is switching to different wallet clients. While I may not be doing many transactions right now, it would be nice to be able to simply move over my private keys when I want to check out a new wallet. I understand that it would be easier to just move my funds to the wallet created with the new client, but I still would like to import my private key if possible. Would this be completely impractical when using a deterministic wallet like Electrum where my funds are so broken up into change addresses? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:36:39
Can't wait to get my hands on one of these. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:34:23
If that knife was potentially worth more than I put in, I'd take my chances. More risk, more reward.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:43:07
I'll keep mining and not give a f*ck. Thank you very much. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:53:00
Pro pro tip: don't use Windows.
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:33:24
Then is seems logical to back this file up, but is it easily transferrable to other wallet clients?
@_date: 2014-04-24 00:29:10
Thanks for the info, I think what I may actually do is use one of my Electrum addresses for my phone and then I can easily manage the funds inside Electrum. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:11:20
Thanks for the link, I'll definitely be reading it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:07:38
While I am all for helping the Bitcoin economy, this seems like a minor and temporary solution. Sure, many people would get excited and some would get very involved, but I believe most would either spend their little BTC or forget about it, causing only a minor surge that will get peoples hopes up. The technology is real and effective, and I believe the natural growth will be enough to sustain itself.
@_date: 2014-04-06 19:00:32
That only happens the first time. After that it should take second to sync to the network.

Compliments of Gyft and Burger King.

You have to realize that your computer will be running at 100% the entire time it mines. If you run that for hours on end you will surely damage the processor (if you're CPU mining) over a period of time. Why not sell the laptop and use the cash to buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:01:52
Thanks for the info, you've been very informative. I'll continue to use Electrum and play with all of this stuff. I just figure it's better for me to completely understand how this all works rather than assume. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:07:12
All you need to know. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 13:50:38
Hmmm well I haven't invested thousands, but I have invested a few hundred into some S1's. If you buy at the right time you can make your money back, and I have. And I'll continue to reinvest. Advising people to NOT support the network in the most inefficient way because of your own loss is pretty ignorant.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:02:30
Mining is the backbone of the network. It by far verifies more transactions than your computer can do, which helps the network be more sustainable and secure. Mining hardware will increasingly become less profitable, but that's the name of the game. I can buy an AntMiner S1 right now, pay it off in about a month, and then it's profit, despite the difficulty rate increasing. I buy a second one in a month, and then half a month later I can buy another, which gets paid off in a month. From there I have three miners, which will get me enough money to buy another in days. I'm still in the hole from the last miner bought, but that will still be paid off in a month or so and from there I have 600 Gh/s making some cash everyday. Not profitable? Then you're doing it wrong.

Multisig transactions with an open arbitrator market is solution.
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:08:31
Multibit is a good cold storage wallet that's secure. Even Blockchain.info can have issues as we've seen of late, though it's not nearly as insecure as an exchange.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:05:17
I would. We don't know the future, so these posts are pretty pointless, but chances are the price will go up. On top of that, if you believe that Bitcoin, or Bitcoin based technology, is the future, then you should be buying. It will only further help the Bitcoin economy and help it become more valuable.
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:19:42
I have 4 AntMiner S1's, all of which I bought pretty cheap (~$230). I have been mining since the end of February and in total put in ~$600 of my own money and now make about $900 a month at today's difficulty and exchange rate.

So, who's going to make the strawberry scented unicorn far coin?
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:17:04
Agreed, I love the wallet but how are people suppose to take this seriously?
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:15:11
They control 45% of that pools hashing power, but technically if the pool gets over 50% and the miners don't leave, they have full control. Yes, if everyone (or many) left once the pool got over 50% then it wouldn't be an issue, but chances are, they won't.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:37:50
Agreed, ponzi doesn't even make sense in this context. People can be so quick to label something they don't understand, as something they don't understand. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 04:11:35
This seems like a lot, but the great thing about Bitcoin is the transaction fee will stay the same even for higher amounts. It is kind of annoying to pay a $0.07 fee for such a low amount, but moving $200 would still cost about $0.07.
