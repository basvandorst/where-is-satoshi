It was just for the convenient petty transactions, luckily.
However they actually have a really easy way to removed crypto, just not USD.

I'm sure you've bought more since 2010, which lowers the roi

Please let us know if it's a scam or legitimate, and if it's legitimate... Why, haha.

Their countries would have fractions of the gdp of the developed world's btc per capita, just as they do now, so their price would be a fraction of a developed world. As they get to be equals in per capita, then they would become fixed in the developed world's prices? Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm just spitballing.

And Africa is a game changer for bitcoin, just need some Chinese help with infrastructure issues to speed up the process.

So it's decided, we tip genuine ideas and thought processes, no matter the location. Kind of bitcoin's point? Give freely as you wish to any user, in any sub.

I know a lot of people in those three stereotypes and I think the libertarian leaning people of those three stereotypes are more likely to own a gun and know how to operate than not. A junkie that hates the government would probably own a gun, a paranoid computer science geek that hates the government probably owns a gun, for example.

I don't particularly get your point, but I don't think you get the point of bitcoin. Upon success, it dissolves the Fed, eliminating any power the federal government has, because of a lack of money to sway any action. Sounds pretty anarchistic, because it is. I'd genuinely like you to peruse and filter past the disgruntled, fed-up-with-the-system posts (which are by no means violent or aggressive, generally following the Non-Aggression Principle) and look at the discussions and literature that is offered.

Unadulterated money transfers would be considered anarcho-capitalistic, free market capitalism, no government intervention. Take your pick, they're all the same. I'm sorry some punk ass kid that doesn't know what anarchy is gave you a bad taste, but it's no punk genre political theory, it's rooted heavily in philosophy.

Saw a couple tips on there, I think that's a great idea. People love free-to-them money.

How about we read them and politely correct any misconception or concerns they have, like some people are already doing.

I feel like it wouls be nicer if it was just a qr decal with maybe bitcoin accepted here.

You make it sound like bitcoin is a religion.
