There seems to be more
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:05:19
Looks interesting but the Trezor shills will take care of it.

**TRASH IT** It's impossible to know if the guts were replaced with evil hardware.

@_date: 2016-04-15 13:29:55
Thanks for the hardwork
@_date: 2016-04-15 14:23:18
That does
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:12:42
I swear, I really want to like this, but the "Bro" vibe is too much. You should re-make it, with a women, 30 year old, someone else that doesn't look like he comes from a frat house. Then It will go viral.

1000 bits
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:06:02
This could change EVERYTHING, I don't think most appreciate how fundamental this instruments are to politics and economy.
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:33:18
They should just ditch the troll they hired; Charlie.
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:59:53
Stop selling airbitz here, this is not what the OP was asking for. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 08:26:26
time to de-list Coinbase, it just keep on getting worst and a lot of ppl will get hurt

What happened to the other thread? 
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:03:07
I have to say, asking them to put in the terms of service the suggestions made on this post is fair.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:22:35
I will never die! Kidding, this is a great feature, but I think that legally this all gets settle by the original will.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:56:57
Circle and Coinbase are banks, you don't own the bitcoins in those systems.
@_date: 2014-12-10 12:51:13
That's very disingenuous, they are trying to create artificial barriers just like legacy financial institutions.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:54:35
Go away yet another SV company... 
There are already many offering what you have.
Could you please elaborate your background in security to support your claims?
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:00:36
Does Coinbase have an official stance/policy on this? What I mean is, do they have an official set of rules on how they lock money if you don't provide verification? I only ask, because I've read the same comments being raised before.
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:07:29
Where is the fix? 
I'm sure it would take less than a second to add a bitcoin address to the template.
@_date: 2014-12-21 07:10:01
Is this true? Major fuck up.
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:35:54
What a crapy idea, on top how do use a trezor on the go, say with your phone? or if you don't have anything nor computer nor a phone? And just want to pay your friend's bitcoin address??
@_date: 2014-10-20 02:05:39
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:32:03
Probably not, the Trezor guys have the tendency of going around bashing all the other products and services. When they can't even protect theirs against [basic hardware attacks]( 
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:48:09
This is so stupid, there is already a bunch of them offering easy APIs for Bitcoin development in a bunch of languages.
1. [Blockchain](
2. [Coinkite](
3. Coinbase
4. Chain
5. and the list goes on... 
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:42:29
I'm tired of this circle jerk, can you explain to them why your product is much better, I have to run out.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:06:17
Do you know the specifics?
@_date: 2015-05-11 11:51:25
Copay is full of bugs
@_date: 2015-05-12 22:11:50
1. Coinbase can still cancel your account, then you are stuck having to use recovery tools to deal with this option.
2. No privacy, coinbase is tracking everything you do. 
There is nothing wrong with using different services for different things.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:43:10
This is the stupidest argument I've ear heard to stay away fro a much better solution. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:23:01
Dup 
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:40:21
I much prefer Ledgers, they offer significant more security with real secure elements. Also cheaper, here is their last post about multisignature 
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:14:12
Are you really going to tell me that smart cards are not secure? 
Also their stack can be checked for provability, just go o their GitHub.
Your answer just shows how much of an amateur operation you are running. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:33:32
I'm really tired of u/MemoryDealers, bitcoin.com and their thugs.
@_date: 2016-03-11 02:19:23
All kinds of red flags here.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:06:59
You just having being around long enough, I still remember the $0.20 days. Up, down, sideways :)
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:02:02
How much of this is on P2SH?
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:58:35
Coinbase offers no privacy and tracks all your transactions, better stick with Electrum, Coinkite, GreenAddress, Breadwallet or Mycelium
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:21:45
Your exchange rate is wrong, should be 29/30,000,000 not 90
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:05:10
I'm with you there, they really are nothing more than "Network Payment Processors"
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:43:07
You could use Bitcore for that.
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:09:24
This guy is a myopic idiot. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:43:37
There is no privacy on Coinbase, but it's easy to buy. Just use a different wallet to keep your coins.
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:50:45
For which features?
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:37:25
On a Monday morning??
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:18:34
I'm my own bank!
@_date: 2016-07-15 13:32:26
Great t-shirt! Ordered.
@_date: 2016-07-15 19:00:19
**Stop whining and be your own bank.**
That's how freedom works, if you don't like the service use something else.
