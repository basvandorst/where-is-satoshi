I didn't see that, thanks. So basically if you don't care about s2x, nothing to worry about. If you do want to access your 2x coins though, you need to split them using their software. Right? Then you can use them independently.

I updated the parent post, which is specific to the Ledger. Do you have one?

How do you not get fucked in p2p transactions? I.e. "I'll give you $500 cash for your amount of bitcoins". So you wait for them to send to your BTC address and they wait for you to hand over the cash. What's to stop the seller from just cancelling the transaction after he gets his cash? 
Edit: I read about it, Localbitcoin's puts the seller bitcoin's in escrow. If they run off with your money, they can release the escrowed coins to you. Smart...I'll definitely use this. 
Is there a way to keep non-anonymous coins from Coinbase or something from also identifying anonymous coins you purchased at localbitcoins? I assume two separate wallets would be enough

Good to see you're a dick through and through and this wasn't an isolated incident. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 07:18:16
You're going to have to be willing to explain it if you want to change the mind of the people who matter...the uneducated masses whose understanding holds the key to Bitcoin's wide adoption and eventually its success. 
Sitting on your high horse, down voting this guy, and explicitly saying "I'm right and if you don't agree up t have time to explain it" makes you out to be the type of elitist hipster Bastard most people associate with this sort of thing. The idea that Bitcoin is so highfalutin and enigmatic as to be inexplicable to the masses will kill it. If you can't thoroughly explain in a few lines a rebuttal to this man's questions, and others like it, I would say you either don't know the subject as well as you think you do or you'd do well to be a bit more patient for the sake of something you seem to be passionate about.

Wait wait wait wait, you bought hardware that you don't physically own? You lease the hardware you bought from this company? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:55:04
Why was so much pumped in all at once?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:59:48
Dude, you didn't do anything wrong. Don't let the peanut gallery convince you otherwise.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:42:00
Then you don't PHYSICALLY own it. Do you know what physically means?
Given the reputation of these guys, I wouldn't expect that hardware when your lease is up.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:28:17
Can you tell me how this works? Did you buy the hardware...and THEN you pay for hosting services? Is it a rent to own kinda thing?
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:40:59
Pretty sure I woke up my neighbors laughing at this.
