Except, and this point is a little more important, the sites that people use to trade bitcoin could be shut down, or even refuse to trade bitcoin/etc anymore. Ofc plenty of sites will sinply move domains and avoid it, but if the accessibility is hurt i imagine the value of the coin will be hurt to some extent. This is ofc all theoretical, i doubt a federal ban is coming.

If you think the value of bitcoin isn't connected to being able to trade it in for other currencies(at least currently) via accessible websites then i don't know what to tell you. Even beyond that, how many services will accept an "illegal" currency, similar to banks refusing dispensaries money because of the current federal legality status. I'm not saying a ban will work, or that it would hurt bitcoin long term. I was just saying there was absolutely nothing stopping our federal government banning it. The war on drugs is clearly a failure yet look at how the federal government treats recreational substances.

Weed dispensaries also have a huge issue of banks refusing their money. I imagine some of the more popular sites would stop trading if the federal government could shut them down. That's why I'm not entirely sure you couldn't just ban bitcoin federally. Though i doubt that will happen.

I think it's important to notice that sites used to buy/sell bitcoin are a bit easy to deal with than torrenting sites, and some sites would probably stop selling/buying bitcoin if federally it wasn't recognized. And making it less accessible to the general public seems like it could hurt the coins value. Ofc the main question was why couldn't the federal government ban bitcoin if they felt like it, and so far the answer has been "they can but it won't do anything".

And as a reminder, the question was why couldn't the government just ban bitcoin if they felt like since you claimed they absolutely wouldn't. I'm not saying a ban would stop bitcoin, but i am saying some dinosaur in power could ban bitcoin because it threatens him in some way.

Not sure why you're making this an arguement. I was asking the op why he thought the us government couldn't just ban bitcoin, as dumb as it would be to attempt to. And you keep using your bitcoin valued at 11,000 this week, hopefully it stays there and doesn't drop back to 3k, or less. I have nothing against cryptocurrency, i just prefer stock currently, as it's all gambling in the long run.

So why exactly can't you ban a currency you already are regulating? Not trying to argue just curious what's stopping the federal government from deciding to ban something, regardless of how states regulate.
