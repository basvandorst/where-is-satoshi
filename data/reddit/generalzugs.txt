You can reread the withepaper, watch Toy Story and search blockchain for clues. Read wikipedia, study Elliptic-curve cryptography and what not. There might be some clues in there and might not. I don't have that much time on my hands, one simple "you don't have to do any of this" wouldn't give anything away.

He also said this is a marathon, not a sprint. I get it. Still, it would be nice to decrease number of paths one can take. If it stays like this, most people will just quit.

This definitely can be direction in which to pursue this thing, but, for some reason I don't think it is _that_ complicated. After all, it is hidden in PLAIN SIGHT. That leads me to believe that solution must be visible with eyes, not imaginary where you need to draw and calculate stuff..

In my interpretation this could mean direction. Go toward infinity symbol and beyond. But also, this is the Buzz Lightyear's catchphrase from Toy Story. Does Toy Story contain some extra clues? 
See, this is the problem. This puzzle more and more looks like wild goose chase. There is not even close direction in which way you can go, you can be stuck in completely different path thinking you are close, just waisting time. I think I will stop trying to solve this until OP decides to give us some real clues. 
I'm sure he thinks it is not that difficult, but that is because he knows the answer. For everyone who doesn't this can be a nightmare.
I remember once creating a couple of (what was for me) simple puzzles for my friends, no one was able to solve them. Even when I gave them a very big hint, almost a solution. They were analyzing them in the ways I would never think about, but none in the right way. This is the same situation.

This has been pointed out several times and only thing that could make sense from this transaction is time (maybe) when it was done. Though I have no idea (for now) what that time represents. If anything. 
This is very good puzzle. Hardest I have ever come across. Kudos to creators.

I tried thinking about this with my wife, as in pair. Didn't help :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:43:24
Think in pairs, not in paris.

Right. That is EXACTLY what I said.

Can the OP at least say (without giving too much away) if all we need to solve this is in the picture, or we have to look elsewhere? Too many things might be relevant here and by not jumping around (searching the blockchain or whitepaper or somewhere else) this would save us a lot of time.
If the "To triumph, one must look within." means exactly that, why so poetic? Just say so. Everything you need is in the picture. Thank you.

If you reverse it, 12121200 in base 3 converted to base 2 is 111111111111 . That's 12 ones. 12 units? 12 words? 12 pairs if you 'think in pairs'. It's also 4095 in base 10. +1 would be 4096, which is 2^12 , but IMO that is not why +1 is there. Although, 2^12 could mean 12 pairs (like 2 is a pair). IDK man, it could mean a lot of things.

I think it's just noise, just like "q" between 'transaction' and 'Nodes', lambda sign, letter "P", "=" sign, etc. Purpose of some of this elements is to fulfill artistic part of the image IMO. But, then there is a gap between party and hardware in top right corner. Does that mean something? 
This is becoming annoying. All these little things that might or might not mean something and without some non-cryptic hint I highly doubt anyone will solve this.
I like to think this is more of a puzzle like in the movie "Mercury Rising" with Bruce Willis and not some multi-mega-step puzzle like in "The Da Vinci Code". I'm probably wrong, though.
BTW, the clues themselves are difficult. If you have to decrypt a clue to find out what it means than it's not really a clue. It's another puzzle. Clue should be something like: it's white.
