OF COURSE it violates exactly what bitcoin was intended to be. Any miner would be crazy to adopt something like this.
Thanks for reading my post in that this whole thing came about as a DISCUSSION with someone and that I'm not crazy enough to actually build something...I was just trying to have an open discussion about the theory...no need for the harsh "good luck" comments.

Yup, I've bugged Kyle and Chris at south station many afternoons (hi guys) and I've purchased about $50 worth.
Very simple, held my QR (blockchain app) to the camera thing, inserted bills, pushed touchscreen, instant payment. They also had a stack of empty paper wallets (folded-private-key) for newcomers who didn't have their own wallets.
My only complaint was their exchange rate (which is continuously updated all day from some average of exchanges - don't know which) wasn't too great, probably about 3% higher than when I spot compared (using blockchain's market page, which is just bitstamp I think)...but I understand that they have to make a bit of a profit, cover hardware costs, etc.
overall, VERY positive and quick.
@_date: 2014-03-18 13:21:07
I assume that's because the BTC price was high. 
I haven't seen it any more than 2-3% higher than averaged market value. I usually check

They have a sign up that if you want to deposit more than $500USD, they need your identity information - when I talked with them about it, it was so they could "verify you weren't involved in terrorism funding or anything like that"
I assume they took a scan of your drivers license? I'm not sure, since I wasn't dealing in anywhere near that kind of money.
This was when they were staffing the ATM all day at South Station to answer questions and make sure things ran smoothly - I don't know how they enforce the $500 limit when it's unattended.
edit: to clarify, it was anonymous under $500

he said that in there, which I think invalidates his whole point. you can do whatever you want with a copy of the data, the rest of the network would have nothing to do with your client if you start to send weirdo transactions around.

@_date: 2015-01-10 14:55:50
I really have a hard time understanding why an exchange would cast their move to AWS as a good thing. 
Controlling your own hardware could at least be somewhat secure. Having the whole exchange on AWS, whew, I wonder how many top level Amazon engineers have unrestricted access? (I keep thinking of that Google super engineer who was caught reading people's gmail). 
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:07:11
why should OP not use web wallets? ever? or just for more than some arbitrary number of btc? &gt;2, maybe? 
if OP only had a laptop which they take to school and coffee shops, should they still run wallet client? how should they secure it?
how should OP secure their smartphone wallet?
if you sincerely believe in OP asking questions to enhance their knowledge about everything Bitcoin (see your lowbrow comments below), they're certainly not going to learn anything from this less than helpful post 
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:38:19
which could have been exactly what happened... 
@_date: 2015-01-06 01:24:02
Good for you for exploring options. and learning what you can. I've been involved for a couple of years, and it's been very interesting with a lot of very strong opinions (see this thread ;-) ) . 
If you're just planning on holding them, an offline paper wallet with bip38 password is your best bet. Send coins to it as you get them, and just let it accrue. The longer someone else holds your money the more of a chance something could happen to it (see bitstamp in the last 24 hours). 
Good luck with everything, and try not to let the cruel commentors of the Internet ruin your day.

He said nothing about storage. He was asking about risks, about an online wallet that is already established with some amount of btc in it.
What if he wanted to buy a nice $2000 couch on overstock?


Also, please refrain from jumping to personal insults and have an actual discussion about the topic. There is minimal risk in the amount of btc he wants to keep in a wallet, and the added benefit is that it's actually going to be spendable (and will enrich the market as a whole if he does spend it), and not trapped offline somewhere.
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:47:54
I didn't see you offering up any suggestions or alternatives to his *already established* blockchain.info wallet. I just see you came in here to throw around negative comments at everyone who gave an answer.
It's clear you're trolling against any type of web wallet. And i'm sorry I fed into your rage, hoping for an actual discussion.
Obviously OP doesn't even care, since they're not even replying, but our conversation will live on in here, and everyone can see that I'm the only one who gave some good suggestions (strong pw and 2FA) and you're the one who just called everything shit advice and offered none of your own.
what are **YOU** doing here, is the better question...because from all of your comments, you're seem to only be here to name-call, not enlighten me on my "astounding level of ignorance"

@_date: 2015-01-05 20:40:54
I fail to see the point of your analogy.
If you're saying that your money is "visible to everyone in a busy street" because it's on bc.info, ALL addresses and balances are visible on blockchain.info. I don't get what you're getting at.
And "thin glass" really implies "so easy to break into and steal". While not as secure as a BIP38 paper wallet in a bunker under a mountain, a strong password and 2-factor-authentication is certainly not thin glass.
Please refrain from spreading around this F.U.D. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:54:16
awesome, thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:43:38
I'll be downvoted for this, but I say as long as your password is secure and complex, and you make use of the 2-factor-authentication settings on blockchain.info, I don't see any issues.
(i have a little over 1btc in my wallet on there for spending money )
edit: just to add, large sums, I'd go for a more secure storage location offline, or between multiple third parties - I have had luck with the coinbase multisig vaults.)

How is that terrible advice? He wants to store some spending money. There's nothing wrong with BC.INFO if you take off your paranoia hat for a few moments.
He can't spend anything in a paper wallet hidden away somewhere, so what's the harm in it?
I everyone just secreted any amount of btc away in an offline wallet, we would have no market whatsoever.

@_date: 2016-12-18 19:45:45
yep, thanks, just remembered that it halved this year. 
that's an additional point: the reward halves on a schedule, so eventually once all bitcoin have been released, the profit for miners will shift to transaction fees rather than block rewards. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 17:39:41
All the math that the mining machines are doing are basically creating the next block in the block chain. Lemme see if I can ELI5:
A bunch of transactions come in on the network, this is people transferring bitcoin from one address to another ("spending" bitcoin). 
A mining node bundles some number of these transactions together**, then takes the signature of the current last block in the block chain plus the signature of the block they just assembled, and starts crunching numbers (hashing) in order to solve a mathematical problem creating a new signature. This is a tough problem, it takes a lot of computing power. 
Machines all over the world will be trying to solve this same kind of problem (with differing sets of transactions, but the same type of goal to "solve and attach the next block") 
once a machine does solve it, it sends out a confirmation to the network. all the other nodes verify the calculation, and now the block chain is one block longer. all of the transactions in the solved block are now confirmed by one block, and all nodes that were working on the same type of problem change the signature of the top block they were working on to this new block that was just solved, and then they start cranking away again trying to solve the next block. 
because each block contains the signature of the previous block, this creates a mathematically provable consistency of every transaction and every block that is completely unchangeable. 
the "reward" in this case is some bitcoin (currently 25) that every mining node adds (payable to itself) as a transaction to the block they're trying to solve. the first machine to solve the block gets that 25 bitcoin. in addition, the machine to solve the block gets to keep all miner fees on every transaction they bundled together. this is why transactions which contain higher fees generally get processed first - the miners want these fees. 
Hope this helps. 
** this pertains to a current hot topic for how "large" each block is, in case you've seen discussions on it.

@_date: 2015-07-23 12:53:54
While I respect your opinion, and could agree with it in some circumstances, it does not apply in this case at all... these girls are going through a LOT to learn bitcoin, and find a way to buy it anonymously. You can't expect someone to do that to every time they need to renew or post an ad (every couple days I think) 
the same reason you don't keep your money in the most stable currency on the world, and exchange it when you need it. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:14:32
I know your comment is a joke, but a serious answer is worth it.  I tell them about: 
 -  mycelium backup, keeping the 12 word backup secure 
 - how once someone sends you bitcoin, they can't take it back, can't steal it from you (most of them are nervous about giving me cash and me running away, I think) 
 - on what a wallet means (same analogy as real world cash wallet) and how to set a pin on their wallet. 
 -  on how to send bitcoin wallet to QR code using mycelium, and how it differs from the Local Trader transaction we just completed. 
 - on some major places that accept bitcoin, like gyft and overstock

@_date: 2015-07-15 00:53:33
Ah! Yes, the block filling test... I thought something was happening in the last hour, since mycelium wouldn't connect. 
If it's the same test that's been running for a while, what made your servers finally start to choke? I've been using it fine all week.

@_date: 2015-07-16 23:09:49
Thanks for responding - I read through that thread the other day, but wasn't aware there was still an ongoing problem. 
Funny thing, I've only had one real sale from my ads about 6 months ago (I'm in Boston) but in the last week has 4 "business women" from backpage contact me and try to arrange a sale, so trader being offline is just making that whole situation even more difficult for these new bitcoin refugees/potential converts. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:10:22

I didn't panic, I know my coins didn't actually go anywhere.. it was just a transaction history fetching problem. 
(and, you should really educate yourself a bit more, no offense intended, just some helpful advice. ,your comment really seemed that you thought your coins were missing... unless you see a transaction sending all of your bitcoin to some other address, they haven't "gone" anywhere)

I force stopped and reopened a few times, and now appear to have connected to a server that works (now I can get my transactions).

litecoin is scrypt-based mining, not SHA256 (like bitcoin). 
It takes a completely different algorithm to mine for blocks. So different, in fact, that Litecoin ASIC miners  (which is a generic term for any specialty circuit) don't eclipse CPU/GPU mining as much as in the bitcoin ecosystem.

@_date: 2017-05-19 02:22:17
(generalizing a LOT here, it was an "ELI5") 
Imagine it like a paper currency - you have some paper currency for some nation. 
There's some kind of second government that pops up in your nation, and they say they'll take Nation A's currency, but they'll also start making their own. You kinda have twice your currency, but not really, because if you spend them in one nation, you can't spend them in another. 
So, you just hang onto your currency. If either nation A or nation B prevails, they're still worth something.

Here's my issue: 
in order to sell BCC, I would have to import/spend my current cold storage balances in an exchange, and that would reveal my BTC private keys... 
edit: sorry, wasn't thinking straight - I guess I can just send a normal transaction, but on the BCC network, and liquidate to the BCC exchange. 
What's chilling, though, is couldn't a malicious exchange replay my transaction on BTC network (since it would be signed and verifiable against the "same" block chain)
