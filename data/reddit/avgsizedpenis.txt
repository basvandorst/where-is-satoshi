It was down for a while (was no longer an option on the drop down menu on their site) but it looks like it is back up again as it is appearing in the drop down menu. Maybe try again in a few minutes?

@_date: 2013-04-11 14:57:58
Damn that is horseshit, really wish there was a fast way to get USD-&gt;btc that was actually reliable. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:17:32
When you deposit into bitfloor is your deposit held in USD or do they immediately convert it into BTC?
