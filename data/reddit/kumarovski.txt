I wish there was a chart that showed how much they delete too? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:44:36
wrong, but good guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:53:54
Here's the CEO's twitter handle:  
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:52:02
hahahahahaha. 
Good point Vlad. This thread has made my day. I'd totally send you some dogecoin for that. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:58:12
what an unusual guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:58:31
What cryptocurrencies on the exchange do you like? 
What would you change about the platform if anything? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:04:26
nope. and it's not kraken.com either and not  either. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 05:12:38
hahahahahaha. that's awesome. i love reddit. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:09:31
Nope. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:19:30
They're pretty legit. I use them. I'm happy. I was just surprised they went with such a big banner. I was like 
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:21:51
major error. oops. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:04:31
nope. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:56:08
I don't even trust banks. Ever heard of the half a TRILLION dollar money laundering scheme of Wells Fargo? 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:47:59
What makes you doubt it? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:29:47
hahaha. no. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:17:50
nope. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:03:40
hahahahahahahahahaha. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:43:05
No NO NO. I'm trying to find out if a lot of my customers would actually be interested in paying via bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:26:59
This is why I stick to 
htp://kraken.com and 
 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:03:55
no. twitter's ahrefs profile looks absurd. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:09:32
this evening after 10 pm PST. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:48:10
Have you used them within the last 7 days? 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:37:50
I'm pretty sure they will release the API. They've done everything by the book so far, haven't they? 
I imagine they can't snap their fingers and just make it happen..... can they? 
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:30:16
correct, we have a credits system. Sorry, I was vague. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:44:43
Because they've got the AML cert. Take a look. If you can find me another exchange that's as easy and more certified, I'm all ears. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:09:21
nope. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:43:53
I bet they're doing it to get all the customers. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:00:03
This looks friggin absurd. 
I'm hoping Kraken and CoinMKT stay legit. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:38:02
hahahaha. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:44:42
hahahaha. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:03:46
It makes me wonder which is the biggest right now: 
The battle of the bitcoin exchanges. 
ButterCoin. 
Going to start buying a bunch of Dogecoin
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:31:56
yeah, there's so many haters for some reason. I didn't expect this to trend toward the top. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:48:05
Alright, guys it's Weebly. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:09:47
hahaha. what the f. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:09:19
nope. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 03:27:08
Alright, so now in the game are.....

I'd place my bets on coinmkt, but that's only because  I use it on the daily. 
Wonder if there's any longbets.com on this sort of thing? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:58:02
nope. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:09:37
nope. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:31:19
nope. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:02:31
the inside scoop. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:57:57
Exactly!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:27:49
hahahahahahaha. lmfao. well done, but no. I mean the website that the stats describe. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:25:25
Thank you sohhlz. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:04:43
hahaha. nope. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:13:00
Thanks for the good laugh. No seriously though, what's the 411 on these companies? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:17:40
not silkroad. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:56:55
They had so many security flaws both from a product development standpoint and more. 
This article just makes me happy I switched to Kraken, CoinMKT.com and a few of the other exchanges. 
Anybody else heard anything about ButterCoin? 
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:52:51
It seems to be working for me. 
If you contact their support they get back pretty quickly. 
PS: It helps a lot if you mention you're a redditor. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:26:45
I was hoping for something a little less humor pandering. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:43:41
The Cryptocurrency wars. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:04:05
it is a website. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:15:20
haha. I don't know if someone is trolling Travis, but  is the CEO's twitter handle. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:30:13
correct, we have a credits system. Sorry, I was vague. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:15:56
it's not. well it could be, but not intentionally. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:45:30
It might not be their CEO who manages the reddit. Just tweet to the CEO at 
I bet it's an intern who manages the reddit account. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:21:56
True, I was hoping to fish out any horror stories or see if there are any warnings about using their exchanges. 
Sorry for invading. :/ 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:16:59
good to know. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:31:10
nope. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:13:36
I use them regularly. 
I was hoping to get the inside scoop. No dice. 
I'm hoping they do some sort of epic promotion. 
You can also tweet directly to Travis, their CEO, at 
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:57:56
The answer isn't even bitcoin related. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:15:13
I'm sorry, I should have been more clear. 
The interest the CIO's both have is in the speed of bitcoin. Much of their financial structures are centered around the slowness of moving money. 
Bitcoin in the USA has a faster transaction speed. 
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:51:24
MT Gox for all 7 currencies? I like...
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:37:25
sorry. Argh. 
Bitcoin has a faster speed than most transactions of money in the USA. 
In Europe, credit cards and mobile payments make cash move quickly. 
In the USA, this can take a while. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:47:39
What's the difference between MtGox and this new site  (Is MT Gox not registered or something?) 
@_date: 2013-07-04 17:11:04
Thanks for clarifying. Sounds reasonable. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:00:37
 Can someone explain the technical difference between bitcoin and litecoin ELI5? 
@_date: 2013-09-09 22:02:46
Dopeness. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:44:00
I prefer them having systems in place for situations like these to keep my crypto currency safe. Even if it means delays. 
The most obvious examples of problems with other bitcoin systems are withdrawal problems with mt Gox, with btc-e, bad customer support with btc-e, withdrawal problems with kraken.
@_date: 2013-07-04 16:48:31
Interesting username. I was wondering if anyone else has walked through the royalty process? 
@_date: 2013-10-17 22:47:17
This is crazy wild. Are these transactions open?
