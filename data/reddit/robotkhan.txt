Ok. Don't panic.
Price dropping in Asia and whales are likely playing games to manipulate market. Watch and learn. if the volatility scares you. You shouldn't be in here, with any real $...
Right now this is microcrash and a minor correction. Likely not the real correction, but FUD and market games.
Welcome to the game. : )
dont buy.(never try to catch a falling knife)...let things level out. BTC futures being offered is a new thing.

Should blow past 19K cell wall and be at 19.5k before noon PST. Look at activity/price on Asian Exchanges. Large rally expected approx 3pm-4pm PST. Bears will attack hard monday with heavy shorting.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:52
exactly. this seems like a scam

my guess is that the rally is more market behavior between shifting back into BTC from other alts. Altscoins had a fast growth last week, now people are taking profits and shifting into BTC.
Current rally hasn't found a base yet. 
But what do I know, if I knew all of this for sure. I wouldn't be on reddit on a saturday.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:43:20
Your analysis was spot on...19.5 and then a drop after the bears start shorting...
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:28:22
yes. but Christmas/New Years is a very long time for social interaction. bump will be bigger and longer.

Prediction: The holidays will see
 an increase in BTC values.
Here is why: 1. most investors in BTC are younger.
                    2. Everyone's mom and grandpa know about Crypto thanks to current press.
                  3. During holiday dinners and parties people will talk about Crypto. more retail friends and family will join as the kid home from college shows them how to do it. (think about facebook when everyones mom discovered it).
                   4. The early short contracts will get crushed around the new year, causing more excitement. and more small bets...FOMO will kick in...(what if they are right, put a little in...because everyone has a coinbase account)....
                   40k by the superbowl...

Hacked Finance and Coin Telegraph are good. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:22:33
hard to call the max right now based on chart. This is a guess. 
25K this weekend settling at 23k. 
Let's connect tonight and see if I am wrong up or down.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:50:30
yes. if you can. but it will not get there today, base on current order book.

Check these out:
My Thesis: (I could be dead wrong. Let's see). These guys made money on Ripple and Litecoin. Rebalanced and moved back into BTC. (BTC was flat all week, while Ripple and LTC skyrocketed). Today these guys wwill wake up late afternoon US time and see BTC price  up 5%. They will dump more in.
I dont know where the new base price will be, maybe 19.5 or higher. Let's resume this talk in a few hours and see, if I reading this correct or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:02:54
Yeah - I think you have a point. The employees committed wire fraud. The executives who knew about it and the people who gave them info (part of the conspiracy)
Also committed a crime.
The big things is this is BS. It hurts all Crypto
What Coinbase pulls this BS.

open an account at TDF Ameritrade and short COE or CME options.
or if you are brave, go to poloniex -- deposit cash into a margin account and sell some BTC...if the price drops you are golden. If you get caught in a rally - you just paid up.
BTC will drop eventually, but when is anyone's guess right now. Too many variables.  People in the press are applying the model of stock market and bond market behavior to crypto. Those rules may not apply. Don't be foolish, but don't panic and be a wuss either. Good luck. Opportunities like this come along only so often in life...

Some of the cryptos will be long term winners, also some of the public blockchains will be long term winners (unless governments outlaw them). 
Right now, we are in a bubble like the dotcom bubble of the nineties. Also the real estate bubbles of the 80's, 90's and early 2000. Fortunes will be made (have been) and lost.
So finding the Google and Amazon equiv. are the play in the long run. You can also make money in the bubble, but you need to be careful.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:55:44
Four words for you: conspiracy to commit wire fraud 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:12:35
 I will doubt it will drop from this high. There will be a  slight correction Monday from this weekends high. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:36:11
i think you are watching the wrong time zone. Most bitcoin investors are in Asia. So it was lunch time, saturday AM in Japan and Korea. 
Retail investors are moving into market expecting a rally. Moving Alt Coin profits from this week (Ripple and Litecoin) back into Bitcoin.
Retail investors are driving the rally. Most of them in Asia.

I know it is against the philosophy of Hodl but stop losses are your friend. You keep some of the gains and you buy back in at the bottom...
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:35:12
So things played out sort of like i expected,  not exactly. it went to 19.7k and then found a grove and traded in a pattern for 24 hours.
the 3-4pm (8am in Japan) really did happen. It didnt breach 20,000 until later than I expected and didnt hold.
 Everyone wasting on CME. Depending on how CME rolls out and the price it could drive a rally either way. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:24:43
Great questions.
Haven't studied they first enough so don't know.
Criteria for the Google/AltaVista, etc is still too early. Depends on use case, public adoption, politics, etc...my plan is to learn and watch. goal is to find google in 1998 and Amazon in 1994.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:37:20
you. my guess is around 3:30 pst
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:11:53
to "short" right now on an exchange like Poloniex,  you are taking more right than buying a short option. 
If you are wrong on your short call, you can lose all of your investment. this can happen trading futures, but not as fast.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:15:46
Sorry! I thought you were being a troll. I'll edit my reply.
My main point is looking at the Sell Wall on Gdax against 19k, it isnt large enough to stop this rally at 19k. When Asia wakes up and sees that the US market is upover 5% from when they went to sleep the rally will extend. On Monday, (when the Wall Street press and haters start in, plus shorting, people will take profit.)
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:36:40
Profit taking.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:30:37
it started a few hours ago. this is what happenes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:09:34
It means GDAX and Roger took a ton of confidence out of the crypto market

people are buying BCC with BTC... hang on
