My guess: They will get sued to hell for this incompetence, they are done. Bankruptcy proceedings will be inevitable, if alone to avoid more serious legal consequences for those involved (i.e. jail time, for knowingly continue running an insolvent business). Legal battles and investigations for years, costs will eat up most assets before any of the thousands of customers even see a single Satoshi, you know the drill. Full Goxxing.

Hopium is a bad advisor and there is always the chance of Bitcoin ending up being the Napster here. If you are heavily invested and cannot afford to lose it all, stop gambling and cut your losses. In fact, you should've done so a lot earlier, you've had plenty of time.

So everyone and his mother has hopefully sold &gt;300 and is waiting for confirmation to buy back in. Now Robin Coin comes along, throwing cheap coins at people everywhere, thus sucking up all potential upward momentum. Where do you expect the next rally or even the next bounce to come from, when buyers are already satisfied? I don't mean to sound dramatic, it's just that supply &gt;&gt; demand here. New money will prove me wrong hopefully, but it would be nicer so see 10million buy the price back to 600s than simply vanish @ 300$.

I admit it is strange behaviour, selling this way on a single exchange. Then again, I don't know what prices you really can get off exchange for a position this size in a strong bear market, I suppose something between 70-90% of market price? Just guessing here. Maybe you are right with the scared holder theory. At least in my book there is not really much manipulating going on. The Wall sits there and waits to be eaten, only got pulled for an hour or so.

Zero fee exchanges see traders/bots realize even the tiniest of profits, whereas on exchanges that do charge trading fees those fees have a chilling effect on trade volume (you cannot enter and exit a position over and over again unless there is sufficient price movement to as a minimum cover those fees).
Whether or not bad intend is involved one cannot know for sure, but it's definitely comparing apples and oranges here. Volume is no useful metric to determine an exchanges market share. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:39:27
I am 100% certain Chinese exchange's zero fee policy got nothing to do with the massive distortion of trade volumes ;-)
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:16:58
Zoom out
@_date: 2016-06-10 19:17:18
I probably wasn't clear enough either: The fact that Chinese exchanges charge zero fees for trading whereas western exchanges do have fees leads to immense amounts of wash trades / zero sum bot trading which makes volume a completely useless indicator. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 09:18:32
Most western exchanges impose fees somewhere between ~0.1 and 0.2% per trade. Take 0.15% as an average. To make any profit you first have to buy and later sell at a higher price (doh!). So fees apply twice, and for any profitable trade price has to rise higher than 2x 0.15=0.3%. If you buy at $500 you cannot sell &lt;$501.5 without a loss.    Assume you trade 100 BTC each time, you will generate 200 BTC in volume. On a zero fee exchange however, you can buy at  $500 equivalent, sell $500.1, buy again at $500.05, sell again at $500.15, buy$500.14 etc. and still always make an (albeit very tiny) profit on each trade. Each buy or sell will generate another 100 BTC volume, possibly thousands in sum, but you would trade nowhere near that often if you had to pay fees for each trade. Comparing Chinese and western volumes is therefore completely meaningless, they are two very different animals.
Edit: Forgot to mention that with zero fees you can also buy and sell at the same price without any loss. And as having the most volume is kind of a big dick measuring contest among chinese exchanges they all try and inflate their "trade volume" artificially by selling coins to themselves over and over again to appear more important than the competition.

Pre halving bottom was $230, post halving bottom will be $460 plus change. The end. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:35:52
I must confess I didn't follow all fee models on different exchanges that closely. Last I checked at least maker fees were largely zero. In case of Okcoin there are/were different fees for mainland China and international customers in place.
@_date: 2016-06-05 19:50:49
2015 saw a lot of price action around the 230$ mark, but price didn't stay below that for very long on any occasion. My guess is that sell pressure below that level dropped because miners couldn't break even, thus it became cheaper to just buy than to mine. So post halving we should see most efficient miners operate at a loss somewhere below ~460$, for less efficient miners with higher energy costs that price will be way higher, of course.
Best guess for 2016/17: unless onchain or sidechain scaling gets implemented and gains widespread adoption within the next 6-12 months we might see the halving bubble take us to whatever may be the peak, only to drop back sub 500 by the end of the year when gravity &amp; reality sets in.

Not to piss on your parade, but your accessibility ratings don't seem even remotely accurate. For example Dortmund, a city of ~600k, is showing exactly 1 acceptance place for Bitcoin on coinmap.org. You can't even order a pizza for Bitcoin over here, how is that accessible? And seriously, calling a &lt;10% premium still practical takes a lot of idealism, in real life 99% of people tend to prefer the cheaper variant even if the margin is less than 1%.
Just saying. Remotely possible? Yes. Accessible or practical? Nope, come back in 5 years.

What I haven't really seen mentioned with all these lunar price predictions is the fact that if Bitcoin were truly to become the one dominant world currency (which we all hope it will some day!), then all other major currencies will fail. USD or EUR or JPY or CNY won't be able to maintain their 1-2% p.a. inflation targets - once they start to deviate to 5% or 10% p.a. and beyond things can go downhill very fast, very steep. Go ask Zimbabwe, Argentina or Venezuela.
I'm not arguing that it is impossible for 1 Bitcoin to reach $10mm USD, I'm saying when it does it will be meaningless because your unit of comparison will have become irrelevant.
We need something more reliable like a Satoshi per [BigMacIndex]( (someone more bored than me go code that) or a [LamboIndex]( to measure the true value appreciation of crypto.

To clarify: Despite my polemic rant up there I actually _WANT_ you to overcome these problems, Kraken.

I live in Germany and can use Coinbase just fine, at least last I checked which was a few months ago. You should try either [bitcoin.de]( as a mere marketplace or [Kraken.com]( if you want to do more frequent trading. Both have been around for 8+ years and have excellent reputations for not getting hacked. And don't \_EVER\_ leave funds sitting on any exchange, even not the most trusted ones. Not your private keys - not your coins.
deposit - trade - withdraw
deposit - trade - withdraw
deposit - trade - withdraw.
PM if you need any help getting set up with those two. And yes, validation will also be complicated with them, as with every other serious exchange these days, as they have to follow strict KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) rules.

We can agree that we clearly have divergent definitions of adoption.
Counting addresses doesn't do the trick, but simply adding up exchange user accounts doesn't really cut it either.
While the number of exchanges has grown over the past year merchant adoption is stalling at best, and what worth is it to the bitcoin eco system to have funds merely sit on exchanges without seeing them being used for any transactions?
And one thing to keep in mind: there are more than 2000 coins and tokens listed on coinmarketcap - what makes you so confident that new exchange user accounts were created to adopt only BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:56:31


I don't mean to piss on your parade, but these stats here paint a little different picture:
There are only 600-650k active addresses, down \~half a million from 12/2017 peak of 1.1 million.
There are only \~6.5 million BTC addresses worth &gt;$100, and thereof only \~2.1 million addresses worth &gt;$1000.
Adoption is a myth.
Comparison with this *'historic'* rich list chart from 2/2018 shows only very little change:
Lots of consolidation in the dust addresses (down 7%) happened, but the 0.01-0.1 range and the 0.1-1.0 range (where one would expect most new adopters who throw a couple hundred bucks into bitcoin to show up) only added 4% and 2% of new addresses respectively. Both ranges combined only grew by\~40k BTC (from 660k to 700k BTC) over the last 9 months. And that despite the fact that price is now lower than back then (on Feb 6th price reached the 6k low after the 20k peak).
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:26:13
That chart in logarithmic view gives a much clearer picture:
After each major peak you see hashrate form a plateau for the following year(s):
06/2011 peak -&gt; hash rate spend the next \~20 months in the \~10-25 Terahash range
12/2013 peak -&gt; hash rate levels out half a year later and stays for another 12 months in the \~200-500 Petahash range
12/2017 peak -&gt; hash rate levels out half a year later and stays for another 12? months in the 30-50? Exahash range?
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:27:00

No increased fees, they charge the usual 0.09€ per withdrawal. Might be tricky to get an account with Fidor from outside Germany though? Not sure if they offer international accounts.

I had been pondering that scenario (me= dead, coins=?) for a while, and finally got around to make the proper preparations for that day. Not that I expect to die anytime soon, but I sleep a lot better knowning that my family will have access to my "digital heritage" once I'm gone. This not only encompasses coins and cold wallets but also access to all online services I ever used, along with instructions on how to proceed with them (which accounts to delete, which data to backup / pass along to my children etc.). It really takes some time to think all of this through, thumbs up for Coinkite to facilitate the process.

Recheck if the address above matches the deposit address provided by the shop. If they are identical, you can prove with the links above that your deposits were sent to the right address. In case you didn't copy &amp; paste the address but typed it out instead, there is almost no chance that you mistyped it and still came up with a valid new address, as your wallet's address validator would not have accepted an address with an incorrect checksum.

It's not really a standard protocol I found somewhere and followed, most of it had to be handwritten myself. I started out with backing up a few cold wallet addresses just for my own use, and only in the process I realized I needed to somehow find a way to pass them along to my family in a secure way. I ended up with a kind of ever growing manual that tries to explain EVERYTHING related to my bitcoin activities in an ELI5 (well, more ELI20 actually) kind of way. Bitcoin, the protocol, the currency, encryption, mining, addresses, wallets, transactions, wallet security, passwords, two factor procedures of various services, how to handle exchanges along with screenshots, concept of cold storage, access to related email addresses and bank accounts - the list is literally endless and you write A LOT when you want to make sure your not so tech savvy family will understand all of it correctly. They  have an idea of how it works, but never took the time to learn the details (whereas I spent years on that hobby). This little “personal Bitcoin bible“ is stored in a secure location which for obvious reasons I will not reveal here and to which only my wife has access to - looks like in the end there is on last third party I have to trust after all ;-)

Closest thing to a main chart that I know of are sites like [bitcoinaverage.com]( or [data.bitcoinity.org](
Arbitrage is often slow between certain exchanges so local prices can differ wildly. The challenge when trying to condense data from multiple exchanges into a single chart lies in finding a reliable way to weigh each individual exchange against each other. You can't just add up prices and divide by number of exchanges, as trade volume is different for each exchange. You can't just weigh by trade volume alone either, since some exchanges offer margin and futures trading, others have high fees where others offer reduced fees or free trading to higher tiers etc, all of which greatly distorts volume. Remember zero fee chinese exchanges doing 99&amp; of global trading anyone?
If you know your way around in tradingview's scripting language you are welcome to experiment with my outdated script [here]( which was my mediocre attempt at creating some average price chart based on multiple exchanges, weighted by volume. I gave up on it long ago, for the aforementioned reasons, but I'm sure you can find similar scripts from others in their vast library.

There are numerous wallet solutions for different platforms out there. Make sure you do your own research and verify that the one you choose is legit and not malware infested. A good place to start would be here: [ No identification is needed to setup your own wallet.
Same goes for paperwallets, you should be even more paranoid. Never use any online service that offers to create paperwallets for you. Always make sure you download an open-source generator software from a trusted source and (depending on your grade of paranoia) ideally put it on an air-gapped PC with no internet connection, but there are better guides out there that explain it in more detail. I haven't done it in a while myself, so I won't recommend any paperwallet generators to you here I used in the past. Maybe others can point you to it.
Buying anonymously is probably done best in cash locally and usually comes at a premium. If [localbitcoins.com]( operates in your jurisdicition you may give them a try. Be careful when exchanging large sums in person with strangers though.

This is a common misconception. The amount of hashing power (i.e. number of active miners) only has a very limited influence on supply, because thanks to difficulty readjusting approximately every ~2weeks, the supply will automatically revert to its current 3,600 BTC daily average (1800 after the next halving in July 2016).

A blockchain notary service for example might operate with tiny amounts, yet keeping records indefinitely of a house sale might be of utmost importance.

Same here (Germany). Digital scans of ID documents are absolutely illegal, simple copies (preferrably black&amp;white / paper) are only allowed temporarily for identification purposes if no other identification is possible (i.e. if you are physically present, no copy of your ID document is ever needed), may not be stored permanently, must be clearly marked as  a copy, and obscuring of unneeded details is highly encouraged. Especially the imprinted card access number, which allows government institutions to access the stored biometric data.

*I do not believe it makes sense for nodes in 1, 10, or 100 years into the future to continue to dedicate data storage capacity to tracking an address holding only a few satoshis of bitcoin.*
This is where fundamentally disagree. If Bitcoin were reduced to its function as a currency, then I might even agree with you. Then to prune all the dust addresses with unspendable micro amounts in it or defining expiration dates for addresses might be a possible way to reduce blockchain size. However, there are many use cases where the transaction in itself is important while the transacted amount is completely irrelevant. If people find proof of existence or proof of ownership concepts useful and want to realize those ideas on top of the most secure blockchain on this planet, then this adds tremendous value to the network. Utility generates value. Taking that usefulness away by the restrictions you propose would just put another nail in bitcoins coffin. Requiring users to actively renew addresses will have a shilling effect where users will avoid micropayments alltogether, but since there is only scarcity of bitcoin blockspace, not blockspace in general all this will achieve is drive those use cases away to alternative blockchains.
*I do not believe it makes sense for nodes in 1, 10, or 100 years into the future to continue to dedicate data storage capacity to tracking an address holding only a few satoshis of bitcoin.*

There is of course also an altruistic component to be considered, as each miner helps further decentralize the process of mining. From that perspective, it is always “worth“ your effort, and much appreciated if you run a mining rig.

b) (Arguably) it was already priced in months ago. Remember last year, when the rocket left the $300 range for good? Yup, that was when you could notice the effect for the first time.
c) Market makers tend to play those naive expectations all the time ("Half supply = twice the price - I better buy!"), so I wouldn't be too surprised to see a massive sell-off the coming weeks instead of the moon rocket everyone expects.
tl;dr: I wouldn't hold my breath.

Buying a cold wallet is always a terrible idea. You have no way of knowing if the private key has been tempered with (copied), so anything you store in that wallet will be in jeopardy of being stolen.
Think of buying a used mail box where the seller did not hand over all the keys - yes, you can put mail in it, but the seller can show up any time and take it all out with his copy of the key.
Depending on the sum you want to store and your level of paranoia, the only save way to do this would be: use an audited open source cold wallet generator on an air gapped computer to generate a set of keys, then carve that key yourself into whatever physical object you want. Make sure the computer stays offline after you used it for key generation, or wipe it completely and thoroughly (delete all data permanently and set it up completely fresh - as I said, depends on your level of paranoia).

You should use margin trading to reduce your exposure to exchanges if you can though. Example: If you own 100 BTC, without leverage, you need to keep all of them on an exchange to be able to trade 100 BTC and run the risk that you lose 100% if an exchange closes doors. With 5:1 leverage, you can reduce that risk to 20 BTC and keep the majority of your coins in cold storage under your control.
That said, the temptation may be great to still keep all of your coins on the exchange and be allowed to trade 500 BTC instead of 100. THAT should be a no go, unless you really understand what you are doing.

I still have hope that someone somehow figures out a way to create a PoW algorithm which can harvest all those energy resources spent on securing the network and direct them to projects like seti folding or other distributed computing projects.

It is the fee charged for any position you open on margin.
Say you only have $200 and want to open a long position worth $1,000. You can do that on margin with a 5:1 leverage, i.e. you "borrow" money at a ratio of 5:1 (from Kraken in this case, other exchanges have more elaborate lending mechanisms) to then buy BTC with it.
The fee charged for this is that rollover fee, collected every 4hrs. For a $1,000 margin position that would be 0.01%x$1,000 = $0.10 per 4hrs, or $0.60 per day.

Fair point, but that same argument (“why change it, it's not a bug, it's a feature“) holds true for every other BIP ever submitted. Bitcoin is still a work in development, and as such improved upon constantly. I'm going out on a limb here and presume that increased anonymity to prevent an Orwellian dystopia come true if possible is something the majority of bitcoin users will very likely welcome. You are free to differ, of course.

Best analysis / guestimate I remember reading on the matter.
As for your second question: no need to deal with anything, BTC are highly divisible already, and if needed a protocol change could easily add even more decimal places. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 10:52:23
The ledger nano acts as a [deterministic wallet]( your wallet seed is just another (easier) way to remember your private keys. If you lose your nano and buy a new one and enter the same 24 key words, it will deduct the original keys based off that seed phrase, and you will have access to your funds again.
To further elaborate: It is by design that you cannot directly access the private keys stored inside a hardware wallet. They are not supposed to ever leave the device, that is what makes them so secure. 
So not your (keys|seed), not your coins, really.

Bitcoins promise never was that of a more equal distribution of wealth. Elimination of any trusted or not so trusted third parties, making transfer of wealth more efficient, censorship resistance and protection from government interference - those are the strengths you buy into. If you want socialism (in the best possible meaning of the word really) you are looking in the wrong place. I can see and share your concerns, a world where bitcoin has become the predominant store of wealth could end up being a very dark place, ironically. Much like the 70s ideal of globalization turned out to be a nightmare for the 2nd and 3rd world of today, financial freedom and liberty come with the burden of self responsibility which can be a nightmare too.

There is an equilibrium between difficulty and price, most visible at the bottom of each bear market. A halvening causes a massive imbalance to that equilibrium by cutting ~~the supply side~~ the rate of increase of supply (=block reward) in half. Either price has to double, or hash rate must go down by 50% as well to restore order - probably a mixture of both is going to happen. Last time the pricing in of the halvening well in advance led to a nice bull market. If bitcoin remains relevant enough chances are good that it will happen again.
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:57:53
Unless the aforementioned equilibrium is restored, mining costs will be too high to make a profit. But that won't stay that way for very long. Either miners are forced to shut down or switch to more profitable altcoins, or price increases.

Yet paradoxically income inequality is in fact increasing, not shrinking, thus creating more losers than winners as a result of globalization.
"Doing great" would be different. We are very far from the visions of those who propagated globalization as a means of world peace and prosperity 40 years ago. Globalization has NOT shifted the balance of power from the rich to the underprivileged. It just streamlined the processes of exploitation.

For the record I live in Germany and I really wish there was a 0% flat tax on all crypto gains, but I assure you that is a myth, my tax report says otherwise, it was &gt;40% on speculative gains. 0% only applies for assets held longer than a year.

Developed countries? Don't do it. Just .. don't. 
Tax evasion will get you into jail quickly, and sooner or later you *will* convert to fiat and you *will* have to declare where the money in your bank account came from. I predict many, many *smart* crypto tax evaders will get royally rekt once regulated exchanges get supoenaed into handing over trade data of their clients for the last couple of years to their country's tax authority. You don't want to be caught with your pants down when this crackdown happens, so get your documents in order.

1 BTC will neither make you incredibly poor nor filthy rich anytime soon, though as others mentioned the upside right now seems brighter than ever.

True, the seed phrase on a paper could be stolen, but so could a PK printed in plain text. That's why it is good practice to only have BIP38 encrypted PK printed on paper. But what stops you from doing the same with your pass phrase - encrypt it in any way you see fit? Or you learn some basic mnemonic techniques and memorize the damn thing, or hide it in a steganographic painting etc.
The point is: wallets for everyday use run on a PC or mobile device with an internet connection. Connections can be hacked, wallet.dat files can be stolen. If you open a wallet software on a compromised computer the PK could potentially be read from memory. But if the PK never leaves your hardware wallet *by design* and all that leaves the device are signed transactions, then there's nothing that can be read by any malware. Unless you find a way to get around the hardware security of your ledger.
The only other way to get that level of security would be an air-gapped machine where you sign transactions, then manually enter those transactions to an internet connected machine - very inconvenient for everyday use.

Keep them until the next altcoin season. The pattern is always the same: new investors learn about bitcoin first in the media after it has risen from the dead (again .. we are here now, or soon will be). They need a few weeks to do their research, set up accounts with exchanges etc., then they learn about the existence of altcoins and other tokens, and when the bitcoin bullrun loses steam they diversify into alts that they perceive cheaper, and finally the whole market goes altcoin shopping.
