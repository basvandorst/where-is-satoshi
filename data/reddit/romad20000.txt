Its not useless per say, but it is certainly FAR FAR from sufficient. This is a fairly standard test that an auditor would use, but it's only one test on one item in the balance sheet. A true audit would look at not only what was owed, but at the fiat accounts as well to insure that the company wasn't buying up coins as needed on the market. It would also focus on internal controls (this is going to be a huge area for bitcoin) things like making sure one person doesn't control the private key for all the funds, that personnel are properly trained, etc... It would also look at the security systems in place, I would imagine that these companies probably shouldn't be using the free trial of McAfee as sole protection. 
Now the interesting part is that all of this is mandated in the Bitlicense. The very things that could give legitimacy to bitcoin exchanges, are the things that exchanges are fighting against   
EDIT: And I'm constantly being reminded of Lehman et al. When they crashed the refrain was always "It was a liquidity crisis", But liquidity only becomes an issue when you are leveraged.

ABSO-FREAKING-LOUTY, the intelligent investor is awesome, and in fact its one of the books that made me want to become an accountant. However Security Analysis is much more detailed, and contains volumes more info. It's almost like the intelligent investor is saying "Okay here's what I do, here's why I do it, here's why you should, this is the basic idea behind my philosophy" and Security Analysis is like "Okay bitch you agree with what I said earlier, training wheels are off motherfucker, Here's how you invest, Here's how you value a company, Here's how to read a balance sheet, you see this bullshit income statement right here? This is how the big dogs will play you like a fool, but this is what to look out for. You see this company here, looks good right? Nah its crap, check out item X, now what do you think?" 
Now its tone is much nicer than described, but still its awesome. However it has a major draw back. It assumes the reader has some accounting knowledge, so if you're still new to financial statements you might find it a bit difficult to read. I have a degree in accounting and there were times that even I had to scratch my head and try to figure out what was going on, but it has been updated with prefaces to each chapter that provide a primer and certainly could help close that knowledge gap. Securtiy Analysis is still used as a textbook in MBA level finance classes, so like I said it might be hard to grasp and you may not be able to understand everything that's being talked about and you may have to take some REAL TIME getting through it, but  even if you only grasp 10% of the book your knowledge base will increase DRASTICALLY!    
Edit: Its a bit pricey too, like a said "used as a textbook" lol I think I picked mine up and B&amp;N for 59.95 and it came with an audio cd so I can listen to it in the car.

Meh possibly but even though the yuan my be pegged to the dollar people still denominate to it. As in I make a product and pay X yuan, sell the product for X yuan, and don't really care about (usually) the rate of inflation. Additionally from reading the article further he specifically blasts bitcoin as a store of value. Right now its trading for 500 but just 3 years ago it was trading for 1 dollar. So unless the adoption rate has matched the 500% increase in price, then the increase in price is simply speculation driven by expected value at some future point in time. In other words would a vendor hold bitcoins without the expectation of being able to convert to dollars? 
EDIT: its funny that bitpay exists because with a program like that the adoption rate is automatically slowed down, and I think its saying something when a business will not accept bitcoins without this support.

I haven't forgotten you, I'm battling the flu so it was an early bed time last night. This morning I saw your reply. My CPA is US issued so I mostly deal with GAAP and not IFRS. I do have one client on IFRS so it's not totally foreign to me, but I'm going through the regs now to make sure I don't tell you the wrong things. I know there are some differences in securities from GAAP to IFRS, IE: I think IFRS requires you to count the change in value in "operating income" and I know GAAP uses "Accumulated other comprehensive income gain and loss" on the B/S. Additionally I can't remember if IFRS allows use of whats called "fair value accounting". So once I get done reading I'll have an answer. Oh and I'm also making sure I'm up on the accounting software, I have never had a client use it (QB is normal, peachtree is a distant second).

you want my honest opinion as an accountant? My professional opinion using all my resources and acquired knowledge? The answer is..... Depends 
If the owner simply took the money and ran, assuming he can be caught in time, most likely you will get it back
If it was hacked, and coins stolen, its very unlikely, and since its unregulated the likelihood of a successful lawsuit is probably non existent.
Third and this is what I think happened (total guess and I could be way wrong) more then likely gox had customer funds lumped in with corporate funds, it was paying off debt and buying new assets with customer money, not corporate money, once the market started to stall and once the price started to fall GOX got into big trouble and realized it didn't have enough to pay back its depositors. In other words it became a classic ponzi, now I saw a balance sheet floating around (again its possible that its a fake) that indicated gox had 173 mil in liabilities, to 3 Mil in cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in short if this is true and gox goes to bankruptcy court you will probably split the 3 million between the other parties affected by a proportional share....
None of these scenarios is a good thing

No you can not write off your investment. As your losses are related to gambling, not too investment. However you can use any gambling losses to offset any gambling gains. A few other issues you are going to have is that all your trading profits are going to be taxed at the short term rate. So not only will you not get a break but you will also incur a tax. 
Any other questions please feel free to ask. I am an accountant, and depending on the exact circumstances you may or may not be able to claim anything.

I'm not a bitcoin fan, so I'll probably be called a troll. However, other than just a break even analysis, you need to be mindful of cash flow. Cash flow is so under rated but it's a big reason good companies go out of business. 
If the only thing you have is 5K and you are going all in on this machine, keep in mind that you are already in a dangerous spot. You will have fees, rents, repairs, insurance, taxes, etc... that will come about, and may come about, before you ever get your first dime out of the machine. 
and the first step is not a break even analysis, that's much later. Market research should be first, followed by an objective SWOT analysis, then analytics. Analytics are guesses and those guesses are only as good as the input you provide. Garbage in Garbage out.

Gee what was your first indicator...  the question is was this a theft ie he ran out with all the money in which case maybe you get it back. Or more than likely it was a ponzi and customer funds were intermixed with mtgox funds (highly fucking illegal in regular exchanges) in which case your money is gone never to be seen again. The worst part os that if this is a ponzi and you made money off gox, say like 6months ago, you will be court ordered to give that money back...lol oh and since gox files will be seized in the investigation and probably turned over to the IRS I would make sure you file your taxes properly

 If that document is true, it proves a couple of things. 1) Mt Gox conspired to defraud its depositors and 2) WHAT IN THE COCKSUCKING FUCK IS THAT "ASSETS/LIABILITIES" SANS EQUITY PAGE DOING THERE!!!! Seriously if an accountant put that together I would slap the monkey shit out of him. In NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM IS THAT SHIT ACCEPTABLE, not even as an internal memo. It honestly looks like a three year old drafted it. 


Shit just change it to "poor accounting" and that's fucking obvious from the face of it. In what crazy ass world would you honestly list yourself as a liability to yourself? So Mt Gox had 120K in coins, that got jacked. That's not a liability, it's a trading investment, AKA short term asset which should be revalued every balance sheet period and any gains or losses should go through the income statement. Fuck even listing it as "treasury stock" is closer then listing it as a liability. I mean really... Are we... what we are no longer reporting PPE, Prepaid Expenses, Prepaid insurance, Acc dep, AR/AP, accrued wages? "Nah just lump all that together, and call one "assets" and list a dollar amount, and call the other "liabilities" and just list another dollar amount, and you know what, fuck that equity shit, who needs RE and Paid in Capital, and common stock, etc... to hell with double sided entries, this is mt gox bitches... Plus that shits totally worthless, like anyone would actually want to see a balance sheet that balances!?!?!?"  Jeezussss.... I'm seriously hoping this is fake, there is honestly no way that can be a true doc... 
Sorry to keep ranting but I just found this thing and part of me is hopeing its real, because it will be the laughing stock of the accounting world for YEARS to come. 


Anyone have any idea what that means? Is Gox suggesting that through arbitrage it would be able to recover all the lost funds? 


So literally forming a conspiracy, engaging in insider trading, and all the while... what? telling the public everything is okay? HOLY FUCKING ENRON! 


So as if insider trading wasn't enough you're going to double down on stupid and admit you are running a ponzi scheme, IE using newly injected coins to pay off depositors?!?!? 
I'm seriously at a loss for words!?!?!? Seriously..... I've had clients do the stupidest shit alive IE try to capitalize coffee cups, try to avoid payroll taxes by "gifting money", but never in my life have I seen or heard about anything as batshit crazy as this, can someone please assure me this is a fake?!?! Because if this is real, then it proves Mt Gox shouldn't be trusted with a fucking quarter, or Magic Cards, let alone sharp objects....

You know its funny you bring the SEC into this.... Can you guess whats the first rule that SEC has regarding exchanges? Go ahead I bet you can... Check this out. 


directive to strengthen the financial responsibility requirements for broker-dealers that 
hold securities and cash for customers.
 In particular, Rule 15c3-3 is designed “to give 
more specific protection to customer funds and securities, in effect forbidding brokers 
and dealers from using customer assets to finance any part of their businesses unrelated to 
servicing securities customers; e.g., a firm is virtually precluded from using customer 
funds to buy securities for its own account.”
 To meet this objective, Rule 15c3-3 
requires a broker-dealer that maintains custody of customer securities and cash (a“carrying broker-dealer”) to take two primary steps to safeguard these assets. The steps 
are designed to protect customers
 by segregating their securities and cash from the 
broker-dealer’s proprietary business activities. If the broker-dealer fails financially, the 
securities and cash should be readily available to be returned to the customers. In 
addition, if the failed broker-dealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), the securities and cash would be 
isolated and readily identifiable as “customer property” and, consequently, available to be 
distributed to customers ahead of other creditors.10 
Hmmm.... Sounds like the SEC figured out Mt. Gox's plan was horrible back in 1970... 
Oh and before the Derp Derp, yeah what about blah blah blah.... Allow me to show you how this rule works PERFECTLY with MF Global. 


And what was the end result of this? 




OHHHHH!!!!!! Look at that shit 100%!!!! Financial regulations designed to protect depositors in the event a brokerage goes out of business, and what happens! They fucking work just as expected.... Now come on, someone please tell me again how exactly does bitcoin benefit from unregulated exchanges?

No worries man, I know regs can be scary shit, and 9/10 most people (even those involved in the business and sometimes even those writing the damn things) don't actually know "why" they are there. Sometimes there are no good reasons or justifiable reasons why regs are in there. But all in all having read the entire doc, I haven't found any. 
Actually that's not true. I think the "fingerprints" and "double pictures, not bigger than 2 by 2" is a little silly, and probably a touch too much (I'm not sure if banks and traders have to do this though?) I'm also not found of the passage you cited above. I think a company should be allowed to invest in anything, that is not traded on its exchange. I'm assuming this rule is intended so that recovery can be made assuming bankruptcy, but it does seem a touch heavy handed. But these are petty quibles in my book.

Pssh! How come you are the only person in the world who can't understand CPDO debt is primarily marketed to buy-and-hold investors who report accrual basis. I mean really, the investors in the CPDO's hold pro-rata shares in the NAV of the SPV less the present discounted value of the management fees. the SPV is invested exclusively in liquid CDS positions and cash, and so the NAV is easily calculated on a daily basis, the value of the CPDO notes at origination is below par and almost independent of the contractual coupon. A severe spike in spreads can trigger a cash out event, in one analysis based on scenarios in which a steady increase in spreads from 25bp at inception to 75bp after 4.75 years is followed by a sudden spike to 300bp.

I get you and that's why I'm not advocating the SEC to step in, but certainly a body that is knowledgeable,  that was trusted and respected within the community, that had open and transparent procedures for "giving its stamp of approval", would assist any investor in making the correct decision? No? Wouldn't it be nice to say, " hey bitcoin has this org and if they give it the good to go stamp then its probably a safe bet"? Doesn't that sound better then "good luck, hope you don't taken for a ride?"

Huge difference in those. Your liability to CC breach is capped, you are protected against that in more ways than one, furthermore the CC have insurance for this scenario, so they don't take the full hit (spreading risk is a good thing). Now what do I get if I send my 600 bitcoin to the wrong place?

Not from you maybe not, however you just proved what all of us know to be the case. In a macro (IE the world doesn't revolve around you) setting people will avoid spending on the thought that "Had I spent 100$ on bitcoin a couple years ago, I could have paid my entire college bill."
So maybe they hold off on getting the car repaired because it will be cheaper tomorrow, or maybe they hold off on getting a hair cut, or dental work. It doesn't mean people won't spend some, but they will spend less. The less they spend (as a whole) the faster the money increases in value, the faster it increases in value the less they spend. This is what is know as a feedback loop, and there are not may ways to stop it.

It's worthless... 
It contains practically no information. There is no assurance from an independent third party, indicating that these transactions have taken place, and that this budget is practicable. It does not report liabilities against the organization, related party transactions. It contains no information on the reliability of forward looking statements,or why unexpected variances might occur and from which activities. it makes no mention of key realtionships, or business risks.  It is not in the correct style or form (yes this matters). It contains no footnotes (specific accounting policies and procedures would be a start) , no MD&amp;A, or who is even in charge of the management and their qualifications, no comparative statements etc..

Let me offer you some better financial advice then "moon town population: you". Take it or leave it but I think I will stand on its own.
1) do you have savings? No I dont mean bitcoin, CD's, stocks, gold, etc..I mean can you live for 3 months MINIMUM, 6 months is preferably, and a 1 year if possible, and  can you access that cash tomorrow? If not then stop, and start here. Do this first and you will be amazed how much easier you will sleep at night. Bitcoin as a long term bet, does not help for a short term crisis. 
2) if yes, then you can consider investment. However I would knock out retirement, home, AAA bonds, Blue chips, Other muni bonds, mid cap stocks, other bonds, other stocks, precious medals, and then finally whatever is left over would be my spec account. And this is what is meant by the phase " don't invest more than you can afford to lose" spec is where bitcoin might come in. While It may "money you can afford to lose", I guarantee you the time lost on other slower but more productive assets, isnt. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:57:07
Why go all or nothing? How much do you need to live comfortably? Why not take a smarter road and say, "Hey if this bitcoin thing takes off, I'll get a really nice return, if it doesn't I'll still be okay". Trust me bitcoin is not the "LAST GREAT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY" If I believed that every time I heard it, then I would be selling: Amway, cutco, prepaid legal insurance, real estate, taking out ads in the paper, buying gold, buying collectors knifes, gone all in on Enron, WorldCom, I would also be working from home making a thousand a day... click here and I'll show you how, and oddly enough with that exact same advice I would have sold B&amp;N stock when the kindle came out, I would have sold Apple at 3.00 a share. More opportunities are already here, and more will be here tomorrow, and if you miss those just wait till the next go round. 
TLDR: The best baseball players are the ones that get a hit 100% of the time, not those who occasionally hit a home run.  
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:19:16
I won't cover what "the voice" has already pointed out, but I will add some different things. Here's the way it works (simplified). I show up to your business, look at the first item on the B/S (which is always cash) and say "Okay good your saying you have 100 in cash". From there the client signs a letter authorizing me to talk to the bank. I send the bank a confirmation letter in one of two ways. 
1) Client Z says he has 100 can you confirm. 
2) What was client Z's balance as of 12/31/20XX. 
Normally I choose the second option, as it provides a touch more reassurance. Now I know what your thinking "wouldn't this be easier with the blockchain" sure would. However that saves all of 1 minute of audit time and 49c in postage.
Now that's not all we do. Additionally I will look through the general ledger to look for suspicious transactions. Did someone record a debt to Cash and a Credit to an expense in an unexplained way? Has the company been doing bank recs daily, weekly, monthly? What is the internal control situation? Does one person do the rec, enter the payments, make JE's? If so then we could have an issue. 
Now keep in mind that's one account and only a few procedures, we still have other accounts that flow through to Cash Ie: AR, AP, Prepaid, PPE, S&amp;W etc... and those accounts get checked as well. 
Furthermore, if my work is shoddy it will be caught by my partners, if not them; then during peer review. Any firm worth its weight in pig shit goes through peer review (David Friehling did not). Matter of fact I'm sitting in a conference room right now, while another auditor from a different firm is combing our files, so naturally I'm bored. 
In short could the blockchain or blockchain like tech speed up an audit? Maybe. But the real time sinks in an audit have nothing to do with verifying balances. The real nastiest are internal controls, off balance sheet items, FUCKING PENSION DISCLOSURES (seriously these make me want to shove rusty nails up my dickhole, if you can speed these up with the blockchain, I will give you a BJ), and last and certainly not least, the most important item in any financial statement FOOTNOTES! So even if the blockchain could verify with 100% certainty (that would be welcomed with open arms in auditing) in 10 minutes. It might shave off 10% of the total audit.

Lol, man seriously?  Regulations are a response to a problem, sometimes they get it wrong, sometimes they are completely misguided. Like say SOX, but sometimes they are spot on. To blame those regulations (created in response to a lack of regs that allowed the problem), as being the problem that they are trying to prevent is at best asinine. Yeah regulatory compliance is not cheap, but somehow businesses still thrive, new industries are still created and markets still function efficiently. You don't seem to be hurting for capital, are you honestly saying that unregulated markets would have less fraud or that investors could identify fraud. In that case why did we have worldcom

I can keep going on and on and on and on and on, however one interesting thing to note, do you know what was the fatal flaw in all of these plans that eventually lead to the collapse? Investor confidence.... Once one investor went, "Hey ummm.... those numbers look like bullshit from here" each and every one of these fell, and the entire way down the cheerleaders were pumping up the masses while cashing out big time. So before you grab the pom poms and start brushing away a fundamental problem of bitcoin, you might want to consider those companies that where 1000's of times bigger than bitcoins, if they can fail so can bitcoin....

@_date: 2014-03-02 15:43:38


Sure does, but the problem is not necessarily fixed with bitcoin. Heres a scenario 
1) you have 1000000 and you know that every year it is going to be worth less and less, you can hold it, or risk it by investing in this solar company over here. In fact they are giving you a bond so if they do go bankrupt you are first in line to your money, they are offering you a 5% return every year. 
2) you have the same amount, you know that every year you currency will get more and more valuable, by around 1% or you can invest as above? 
Which do you choose? Is a 5% return worth enough to justify the added risk or is 1% risk free good enough? 
Now we see the problems, start ups have to offer better and better incentives to get the same amount and the repayment of that extra amount could crush the business before it starts. 
Also debt plays a huge role in all this. People are more willing to take risks especially if they know they will not be in the poor house for ever because of it. I would never put up 100% of my money to start a business as its completely crazy to do so. Then you talk about R&amp;D? Would you put up a million of your own money in the hopes that someone could figure out free energy? So by insuring that debt will be non existant, we would solve one problem to open others.

Not true, first off your making the assumption that coins were actually stolen. Now that's a possibility, and could be true but time will tell, additionally the books can be sound, but the coins still missing. Additionally the books could be correct but not be an accurate reflection of the companies financial position. I can only seem to find a income statement sans balance sheet, cash flow statement, and disclosures, however once, and if, those are ever made public it will allow me to tell you the full tale. My guess is something like this. Mt Gox didn't follow the SEC rules regarding segregation of funds, mainly because its not required to, it simply rolled all customer deposits with its operating income and overspent, that means gox had unfunded liabilities and when it realized that it could no longer pay, it stopped operations. The problem here is that gox is not regulated and if the above scenario is true, then it will be impossible to get a conviction, or seize any assets.

Your right and wrong at the same time. Merchants were not allowed to pass processing costs onto customers. It was part of the Visa Mc Amex agreements, and violations could result in a blacklisting. Footlocker sued and after a ton of years the courts said it was an anti trust violation, and this paved the way for the fees to be passed on to the customer. In bitcoin with "no fees" the merchant has no incentive to lower there profit. A 1-2% discount is not going to pull in droves of customers. The difference between 1.00 and .99 is not going to register in the minds of most people. So in essence the business will lose 1% of each bitcoin sale, and of those 99% would have bought regardless of thw discount. Now maybe that equation changes for high dollar goods, as 1000 vs 990 might pull people in, but the product has to be profitable at 990, otherwise your competitors will match you and your price advantage is gone, and youre back in the same boat

Greatest book ever, definitely not going to go over well here though
@_date: 2014-05-28 14:42:00
So.... Whats your plan? Here are somethings to think about (sorry for the delay I was on the shitty kindle last night) 
1) Why? Why are you investing? Are you looking to buy a car? If so how much time until you hope to meet that goal? Are you saving for retirement? kids college funds? Once you answer this question you should be well on your way to understanding what needs to take place. 
2) What is your financial position? Do you have at least 6+ months (1 year is preferable) salary in savings? Any other investments? The reason I ask is that investing is a long term game. If you are investing money that you may need in case of an emergency, YOU WILL FACE AN EMERGENCY! I guarantee it... You don't want to be forced to sell in a down market simply because you ran out of money and need to replace a flat tire. It's a lot like fighting a war. You would hate to abandon a winning front, because you forgot to insure supply lines were protected. 
3) What rate of return are you expecting? This goes back to question 1. If all you want is a nice return say 10%, 15%, then other financial instruments are probably better and less risky. If you are hoping for a 100%, 1000% etc... Then honestly I would say you are gambling (nothing wrong with gambling I'm a craps man myself) as those returns are not sustainable and in investing we look for slow steady returns. The reason is, compounding. Compounding allows you to invest less and grow more, with less risk. Think of it like this: You have a choice between two ball players, player A will always hit the ball, player B will either hit a homerun or strike out. Which do you want on your team?
4) What is your buy in point and your sell point? This is critical, buying high will kill a return before it can even get started. Also once you figure out those you will be able to avoid the waves. If you buy at 500 and are expecting a 20% return, then when it hits 600 you bail. If it goes to 1200 oh well you missed it, no bigge, happens all the time and more deals are available in other places, at other times. 
5) BE DISCIPLINED!!! This is the most important one. If you are not disciplined you will lose and lose big time!!!! A point of advice I give people when they go to the casino is don't take more than you want to play with. If you walk in with 100 and lose it on the first roll then leave! Don't try to win it back, just walk away. This is the hardest part for most people. They buy at 400 and see the price go to 500 and think "Great I'll let it ride" Price goes up to 600 and there beliefs are reaffirmed, and they keep going until the price crashes and they are left holding an empty sack. The worst are the ones who are also re-buying during the waves. 
Now like I said those are the basics, a few other questions you might want to ask.
How much do you know about investing? Can you read a balance sheet? P/L? etc... 
How much time can you spend with your investments and learning about them? None? all day and night? 
Once you answer those questions you will quickly see what needs to happen

Do you seriously want other people to tell you your investment strategy? The first step of any investment is: Have a plan.

see now we are on the same page lol. I can understand not giving full disclosure statements monthly as that would be UN GODLY expensive and probably a waste of time. Furthermore I would even be willing to accept just who the auditors are, what the scope is, and what regs there applying. I think those things alone could be a huge help to bitcoin. 


Right!?!?! I'm not sure if you're familiar with IDEA, but that program is BADASS, and it could very easily query that data it also accepts data from QB, PeachTree, Excel, CSV, and a few other lessor platforms, and any decent accounting software I ever come across at a minimum allows for TB export into CSV or EXCEL. I mean if you came to me and said Romad you will look at this company monthly, and you only have one billable hour, the VERY first thing I'm going to do is verify balances. If time permits I would probably move on to make sure no transfers went to personal accounts. 


No doubt, I know clients that don't check bank balances daily, and I have one client that only checks it monthly, (against our advice), however to think that you could do a bank rec consistently month after month after month, and not notice your are continually coming up millions short?!?!?! Is absurd and that's putting it kindly. It either means he had extremely piss poor internal controls and segregation of duties, a complete and utter fool who never should have been in charge of so much money, or a lying little shit who was worried about missing funds and instead of doing the right thing, and stopping, pulling his head out of his ass, and calling for help, he chose to keep pedaling the lies in the hopes that he could make the funds up.... somehow.

I know this is a dead thread, but wanted to see how long you looked at Bitcoinshop F/K/A TouchItTech F/K/A Hotel Management systems? I'm looking at the the 10K and the 10K/A (Never a good thing) for almost all years, same with 10Q 10Q/A. Along with the NT 10Q'a Also worth noting check out the SEC letters in regard to this company available here  That is by far some of the most appalling letters I have ever seen as a CPA


view” of the financial position of the company. Please confirm if the reference to a “true 
and fair view” has the same meaning as “presents fairly” and revise the opinions to 
replace this language so that the opinion paragraph follows the wording requirements of 
PCAOB Standards 
Really? That's day one stuff. Now on to the 10Q's which had to be restated because the company somehow "forgot" it had 600K in outstanding debt (approx 50% of total liabilities). Further more the company increased "trade receivables" by 103% with no "allowance for doubtful accounts"?  Furthermore its debt was converted to equity on January 31 and then it announces that its changed its name to the bitcoinshop at which point shares rocket to the moon. I think something smells here a little worse then "pump and dump" and I'm just wondering if you dug any deeper?

Because markets are irrational? Because the supply is outweighing the demand? Because Bitcoin was overvalued to begin with? Because the FBI is going to sell its holdings?

So no bitcoin then? All you're doing there is switching the fraud from customers and onto businesses. If people are bent on fraud they will find a way. All bitcoin offers is a way for them to conceal themselves. Chargebacks represent a small fraction of all CC expenses,  and almost everyone uses them daily and most never have a chargeback. Whereas almost no one uses bitcoins but in Mt Gox alone, you had 7% of the entire wealth wiped out over night. Thats not counting neobee, Bitcointia, BLF.
 So bitcoin has invented a problem and proposes solving this problem, by assisting the problem.  That's like getting another cancer to fight off the first cancer.

You can't be forced to testify in this country either, however if the government knows you have bitcoins or believes you have bitcoins then they can compel you to give up the keys, and if you don't they can hold you in contempt. This is probably one of those issues where the anonymity comes back to bite you in the hind end. I seriously doubt that any country in the entire world would be to enthusiastic about you disobeying a judges orders. So maybe you should come and join the real world, where things like this happen all the time.

from the store of value function, for example if the same cryptographic methods and

exactly what is in place today. Bitcoin advocates who benefit from Bitcoin 
appreciation argue strongly for its role as an asset, but the transactions technology 
is generic and efficient and less complicated than introducing an intermediate 
currency (Bitcoin) to facilitate USD to USD or USD to EUR transactions.

Yeah and usually the calc comes out as SHIT TON OF RISK/SHIT TON OF REWARD! What you will not see is little risk/ shit ton of reward, or shit ton risk/ little reward. VC's only operate in the first category and for good reason. They don't need every or most investments to pay off, they only need one out of the thousands and they are set to cover losses and make a hefty profit. 
If bitcoin happens to take off VC's will make a boatload, if it doesn't they have lost practically nothing. They don't care about the success or failure of bitcoin, they can about "filthy fiat money", and having enough of it to snort coke from a strippers asscrack on any day ending in "Y", from now till they die from an OD! If they could profit from bitcoins failures I have no doubt that they would pile money into that too.

Maybe if you understood securities laws, and why they were implemented in the first place then you would understand the SEC. For a long time "Voluntarily, honest exchange" was the norm, but after a number of people got ripped off from shady fuckers, people decided "hey maybe there is a better way." and big bang boom, blue sky laws were enacted, or you could spend another 50k figuring that out. My guess youll take the latter option. Even if your investors made a 20% return. Thats chump changes compared to the 300% plus return, the SEC made when in forced you to give the proceeds back. So in essence the evil gubment made your investors more money than you did. Aint that an ironic bitch?

Nothing in that document is more cumbersome than any other business in the same industry has to face.

I asked yesterday and you must have missed my post, What exactly are arguing against? What part of the regs do think pose such an "insurmountable burden".

Oh.... boy.... Okay what you just advocated was a classic pump and dump or a perfect explanation of the greater fool theory. Essentially this sub would be buying all the coins the miners are using. Therefore keeping the price higher than it would have been, in order to attract more people, in an effort to conceal the risks, so that you can then sell the coins you purchased at a profit. 
Why not just have miners stop mining if its not profitable, or why not have miners just hold coins instead of immediately dumping them. Could it be that miners realize how easy it is to make money and the ones protecting bitcoin the most, are the least likely to give a shit about it?

Here's the problem as I see it (an auditor, hate tax). A de minimus exemption for bond purchases is only a quarter of a point. That's freaking nothing. I seriously doubt the IRS would be more lenient with bitcoin. I think there should be some type of min but with bitcoin I'm just not sure how to do it. Plus with the tax code, the burden of proof is flipped, (IE you have to prove that you are entitled to the deduction) and this could cause other issues.  I'm just reading what you have posted, and haven't hit the paper yet, but I'm sure I'll find a few more problems.

You can have your son receive money upon your death on his 21st birthday without a lawyer and accountant? Please enlighten all of us. Set up a bank draft. Done! Boy you guys are masters at moving those goal posts. Your original comment was:


Bitcoin changes nothing about that aspect of it. If you're trying to say, "Bitcoin allows you to set up a transfer now for the future!" then great but there are still other issues it raises. What if my son dies before 21 but after me? How will you program the "if then statement?" Would the money just go to a dead wallet instead of my grandkids? Sounds like a shit system for twats. 


Question do you think robbers will stop robbing? Do you think its safer to just give a mugger your money or take a shot with him being a pussy? I can't wait for this answer. 


And the first post under it, IS YET ANOTHER PROBLEM! So once again bitcoin solves nothing and only adds to the problems.

Wait are you blaming US regs, which would allow you to have an exchange, for creating demand for unregulated exchanges? Matter of fact if you guys werent so rapidly against regs you would have adopted THE VERY FIRST RULE the SEC has, for segregation of funds. So regulations designed to protect you that you didn't follow of your own violation, those same regs are still somehow responsible. ....what the fuck kind of crazy twilight zone am I in.

No your right, taking a fee is fine like say 9.99 per trade or 10% of the value. But to take a portion of the "security" being traded would fall under "market manipulation" regs, it doesn't seem a lot but if gox is taking say 10 coins a day from "clipping", then they are artificial increasing the value of any coins left in circulation, after gox acquires enough coins it can start dumping them on the market, to decrease the price of coins. It just seems highly unusual that gox would take a fixed percentage from the seller and a fix amount of coin from the buyer? All exchanges, like etrade, Scotttrade, etc... make there money on those % fees. I know the two aren't comparable and if people know about it and they are cool with it fine, it just seems really odd to me?

No no no. They don't gain the rights that's the point. It's your card your name your money, if you accidentally send bitcoin to the wrong person it's there's and they can do as they please, unless you can force them to stop. Furthermore even if someone uses your card and all your info it can be fixed and stopped immediately. So again c.c. protection vs bitcoin. The comparison is fair as it relates to security features, and CC perceived short comings vs the benefits of bitcoin. However you're ignoring all the places where CC is vastly superior and highlighting a minor issue as a major flaw.

Well first off no, no it isn't. I'm not incredibly wealthy and I have all of those things. It took time and discipline. If you want to spec with your money before your taken care of, fine. If you can't wait to have this... fine. If this is the last time a paradigm will ever come around, fine. By all means, fufill all your wants. Just recognize it for what it is, a last ditch gamble. Sure some people will never achieve this, but it doesn't change my advice. If you make a dollar a year or 100 million a year, take care of those first, then you have money you can afford to lose. Until all of that is met you can't afford it.

YOU CAN!!! Lol in fact we do in the US, its called the NYSE!!! It sets its own regs, sends them to the SEC, who makes them available to the public for comment, once the comments are closed it sends it back to the NYSE with the comments and the SEC notes, from there NYSE looks it all over, sends the final draft to the SEC and bang done. The SEC is only there to protect the investors from NYSE making rules just to benefit itself. It acts a neutral third party, and that's what you guys are seriously lacking.

Or whatever? So let's face it you have no idea? where did you hear that? Mt. Gox? did you ever seen Mt. Gox issue an unqualified opinion from an independent auditor? Let me put it to you this way. Audits done every month would be non stop audits. It takes a week alone for most small to midsize companies of just field work, and the disclosures alone probably take a week. I seriously doubt the "Japan Finance Authority (or whatever)" was doing monthly audits of gox.

Careful with that intrinsic value word. Dollar bills by that definition have intrinsic value. Bitcoins value is based on what the market is willing to pay for it. 
Now as to the chart I'm honestly not sure what it shows other than a comparison to unique address (i'm assuming this is new?) vs Transactions to known addresses? (I'm assuming these are exchanges?) Now my understanding of this aspect is extremely small but if I have a coinbase account (I'm assuming that's one address right as they are a wallet service?) and then move my coins offline is that 2 unique addresses? As for the comparison if I'm reading this right 15,000 addresses / 40K transactions= 37.5% and today 69,000/1900000 36.3%? So how would a drop in transactions lead to an increase in the price?

My boss a 55 year old, non computer person was asking me about it? My friend who manages a local eatry was asking me about it. I heard two REALLY old farts in the lockerroom today talking about it. I would say the general public knows, and they all think its a scam (most of them have no idea, and don't care about the protocol, they think its fake internet money), the only news for bitcoin is usually bad news (which is somehow good news here) and that is off putting to the average user (the ones who in the end will make or break bitcoin). So the problem isn't one of people not knowing about it, its one of people having a bad impression of it.

Banks don't make money on Storage, Selling Commodities/currency, POS systems, they don't operate exchanges all of these are handled by companies that are not banks. 
The only one that banks could possible profit on would be storage, but since they can't lend out bitcoin's you would have to trust in the banks security/ IT departments, and the fees would be exceptionally high. I pay 50 dollars a year for a tiny box that sits in a big ass vault.

@_date: 2014-02-28 20:57:02


lol wat Da fuq is dat? I think my brain just fell out of my skull. Financials are not hard to comprehend, and lucky accountants are incredibly boring and we don't change much. So a Balance Sheet from 1940 looks pretty damn close to a balance sheet today, the hardest part is figuring out what those accounts actually mean. Where I would gain the advantage on you is on the little things. For instance if I know a company produces widgets and they have a 5% fail ratio, but occasionally around the end of the qtr the fail rate jumps to 8-9% I can guarantee I know exactly the accounting scam the company is running. 
Now where you would beat me (or should), is in analyzing certain company disclosures. For instance I'm currently holding X or US steel, now I know the steel market is disgustingly over saturated right now. Its why US steel only makes .10 for every dollar, that's tight margins. So if I was you I wouldn't worry so much about looking at things like Quick ratios, P/E, etc... (you need to atleast know what they are, but maybe not all the ins and outs) stick with what you know, so for example you might look at US steel and go "ah these bitches are wasting product because design plan b is diffi-q's and should be  prob-stat. (as you can tell I have no clue what I'm talking about here)" Now Security Analysis will help you with that.     
1) Sure I can give you that, however one thing that may cause that formula to flip is regulation, AMEX and VISA are regulated to the moon and back again, and this is a huge part of the cost. Additionally they exercise a quasi monopoly (this is where I think bitcoin can be valuable) which naturally causes for less competitive rates. If they feel threatened they will lower their rates, good for all of us. So just make sure you keep an eye on those big dogs, and be ready to re value point one if/when/ever the moment comes. 
2) Is a very good point and one I have considered. In fact if we use the market cap of all US stocks and Bonds we quickly figure out that its 38,000,000,000,000. So yeah.... 21,000,000 bitcoins replacing 38,000,000,000 (and that's just the US) means each bitcoin would be worth an absolute metric fuckton, I think that's an engineering term IDK... But in this case its like a willy wonka ever lasting gob stopper, you don't need more than one, and one is all you need. Now getting all US currency gone is not going to happen unless the US drops the legal tender laws, in favor of bitcoin, and my guess is that if Washington can't control it, that's probably not going to happen, however you're right the coin has a ton of room to move. The 21,000,000 is also assuming that no coins are lost! The DOJ seized 2Mil in the silk road raid IIRC and Mt Gox, assuming the guy just deleted them, and then all the REALLY early adopters who were able to mine thousands of coins when the value was basically zero and just deleted the wallets, I wouldn't be surprised to find out that over half the supply of bitcoin is gone to never be recovered


Like I said before just be careful, if you're getting into bitcoin at this stage and your theory is correct that bitcoin will gain even a modest share of the global market ~10% then with one coin you will be a millionaire, so you don't have to throw all in to win lol, risk v reward lol. The only thing that sucks about bitcoin is there is no way to really make a hedge, or short sale...:(

I get you're point, I understand what you're trying to say, yes the fraud that you are talking about does happen, yes it's a flaw that needs to be addressed, however it's a flaw that if exploited has a very easy process to fix the problems it causes.  In fact this flaw costs the merchants money which insures they put the proper protections in place to stop it, IE cameras over the CC machine. However these problems haven't hindered businesses accepting CC. Bitcoin offers a fix for this particular fraud, but opens one up to much bigger problems. So the risks do not out weigh the benefits, therefore CC is still superior.

Then your grasp on econ is shall we say...... rather weak? Inflation was at a pittance in those days, in fact if interest rates had increased it would have had the exact opposite affect (slowing down home loans). So no inflation was not the problem not by a long shot. 
 &gt;There will always be more money then there is investment opportunities... since when you invest you in essence create more capital through fractional reserve. 
Says who? Every single US dollar could be invested in microsoft, theres no law against that. However in this case microsoft would become prohibitively expense, meaning the ROI would drop rather quickly.  


as long as markets are irrational there will always be investment opportunities. I never would have guessed amazon, apple (1990) would be this successful today. So were those "investments that shouldn't have existed"? Furthermore if you told me Yahoo, BlockBuster and AOL would be replaced with FaceBook and Google I would have thought you were taking crazy pills. Unless you have a crystal ball that allows you to see into the future you will never know which investments are sound and which aren't. Hell circa 1999 Enron, WorldCom, and TYCO were a GREAT buy, that didn't turn out so well.


If you think you have done enough research fine! Be happy with what you have found. However I would suggest you go back to square one and remember that econ is not about "views" its about how people make choices. In some circumstances Libertarian views may hold true. In others Austrian, and in others Keynesian. However in no school of economics, worth its weight in turds, would acceptance of "one view" be considered the magic pill. Seriously Econ is some tough shit to learn and without a formal education (IE college) in AT LEAST Micro, Macro, and International Banking, you can't even begin to have a discussion about different theories. Studying on the internet is good and very useful and it can lead you to question what you know and hold true. However it can also lead you astray, and can lead to you being mislead by dubious sources, who have no qualms about taking advantage of your ignorance. If your seriously interested in Econ, take one of the free classes online,  learn the actual theories in a neutral environment from professionals.

And any intelligent employer will avoid it like the plague. There are numerous reasons for employers to have set paydays:
Proper record keeping, ex) employee forgot to clock in until half the shift was over, gets paid that night, claims 5 years later that they were never paid. 
Accounting: if you've never had to accrue payroll, then you will never know the joy of throwing a monitor through a window. In fact most companies that pay on the 1st and 15th, actually pay on the 15th and the last day to avoid this. 
Unclaimed property laws: as far as I know (not a lawyer), you're responsible to prove that you paid your employees,  not the other way around. So if an employee says "member that bitcoin thing, I lost my wallet and didnt get my paycheck" you the employer may be responsible. 
Cash flows: most employers don't have cash lying around for daily payrolls, in fact that practice taken to the extreme could bankrupt quite a few companies. 
Payroll itself: having done 1000's of audits I can say with 100% certainty that one phase you will never here from managers is "another payroll to process! SWEET"
Pay check to pay check employees:  Individuals who cant make it from one to the next are a fraud risk. If their not in charge of financial assets this might not be a problem. however my personal view is that this would only make the problem much worse, and I can see many people who would spend each days wages and end up on the street. In fact, I would have been one of those in the not to distant past.
Exchange rate risk: as an employee I wouldn't want it, especially if the price is decreasing. With a decreasing price we have a situation where employees paid daily will be paid less than those weekly, and inversely with a price increase. Not to mention depending "when" it's paid it will have an effect on total pay. This is a recipe for disaster on many fronts.
So while it sounds like having a daily paycheck would be awesome. I doubt it will happen on a large scale, and might even be a really bad thing.

If you raise your price by 4% you're a fool. Lets say you have 100k sales, accepting credit cards will allow you to make 100k more sales, but it costs 4k in processing fees. Your still better off accepting cards and the % of CC fees to sales is cut in half (in essence your cash customers are subsidizing CC). Its like advertising in this regard. Thats why the question is "will it bring you more business". If you are going to do 100k with or without CC then accepting CC would probably not work for you.

As a word of advice anytime something will "revolutionize", or "usher in a new age of accounting" it usually means "accounts will make more money". As to assertion that bitcoin will be revolutionary, I find a few issues. While it will certainly make verifying balances easier,  and it will certainly be easier to parse for information. Those two things alone only account for a very small percentage of audit engagements. The trouble comes from figuring out items like: intracompany sales, distributions to owners, asset control, off balance sheet items, revenue timing, recognition, etc... It also doesnt help in anyway with non cash estimates: depreciation, amortization,  goodwill impairment, and to further complicate matters brings with it massive internal control issues. So given all those issues we may see certain types of fraud declining (ie ponzi scheme,  false account balances) but we may have more frauds to replace it (inflated intracompany sales, improper revenue recognition etc..)

Is any bankruptcy proceeding normal? ever? Its generally considered something that should be avoided, and it each case is different, shit Enron still has workers.... working....  trying to wind down deals and recover customer money. No one ever said bankruptcy is supposed to be fast 


Judges don't just throw shit at dartboards to figure out who gets what there are clearly defined rules and regs for this. A primary rule that all brokerages are required to follow is  


securities and cash should be readily available to be returned to the customers. In 
addition, if the failed broker-dealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), the securities and cash would be 
isolated and readily identifiable as “customer property” and, consequently, available to be 
distributed to customers ahead of other creditors.
So its not hard for a judge to say "okay if you followed all the rules and went bust who gets priority, well obviously the deposits are up first because specific regs govern these and if followed would be paid back before bankruptcy" From there its based on a number of things but usually in the order I stipulated above. The reason is the expected risk, depositors should have a small guarantee that there money is not being co mingled, hince the SEC rule, creditors less so, and equity guys know they are going to get shit on. This is not uncommon.

These at the very least should be made available for public inspection, if they are not they are worthless. Even if the audit was just too check bank recs it would still take longer than a day, assuming the "auditors" weren't just walking in and going yep looks good. We're talking 350 mil dollars min, with literally thousands of transactions a day, even if you export your accounting files into IDEA, it would still take atleast a day to insure customer funds were properly segregated and that un authorized transactions took place, internal controls twice as long, I mean honeslty what where they "auditing", with being able to view the reports i guess well never find out.

no not at all. unless it's strictly kept as a hush hush drug deal type thing. Once businesses start taking it, once the general public starts taking it, you can bet the very next thing to follow will be regulations. Maybe not on the currency itself but certainly on the institutions accepting it. Furthermore you can have regs (not even laws) that will make it practically impossible for a business to accept it. For instance the FASB could say that bitcoins held have to be marked to market everyday, that would certainly drive up the cost of accepting them. Furthermore an accounting firm could decide that accepting bitcoins presents certain risks and require extra procedures to assess internal controls.

You don't need a special accounting software. Are you exclusive bitcoin? I can give you some ideas but I need to know a lot more about your business. Im assuming your not using bitpay et al.. right? Also you're receiving bitcoins, but what are you playing on doing with them? Holding or using asap to pay vendors (this is hugely important for classification). Are you an American company?

First of all not "companies" as most businesses are exempted from all of this. Secondly can you figure why it would be a bad idea for a company that controls the exchange, to also invest in the assets being traded  on the exchange? Does this sound like it might cause more then a few issues? Can you ever be sure that a company is not manipulating the exchange in its own favor? So yeah best business practices. 
Any other parts of the reg? Cause that only covers 200.8(B) there is a lot left to deal with? If that's the only problem you have then I would say that you should lobby to change that. Additionally its still enforceable and its not absurd, so your post is still more hyperbolic than fact.

Doesn't matter what you call them in bankruptcy the trustee, or judge will decide who gets what and when. The judge could very well decide employees are the first up, followed by secured creditors, followed by unsecured creditors,  and depositors get anything that is left over. Its unlikely it will play out this way, but it could. If a business is crazy enough to start liquidation of its assets, without the courts approval, the court could very will rescind its bankruptcy protection order.

Bitstamp: "So you're saying we should just hold onto coins in case "something" cough happens.... cough???? in order to make us rich? 
Buffett: No no I'm saying bitcoin is a total scam see, and I would never invest in it, but still you should totes consider crashing the price.... For.... Reasons....

You still haven't learned have you. As my dad said do your homework or you will get spanked. 


Now why would a bank call the CFTC and inform them about this? Oh that's right ITS THE FIRST RULE REGARDING DISCOUNT BROKERS. 


more specific protection to customer funds and securities, in effect forbidding brokers 
and dealers from using customer assets to finance any part of their businesses unrelated to 
servicing securities customers; e.g., a firm is virtually precluded from using customer 
funds to buy securities for its own account.”8
 To meet this objective, Rule 15c3-3 
requires a broker-dealer that maintains custody of customer securities and cash (a“carrying broker-dealer”) to take two primary steps to safeguard these assets. The steps 
are designed to protect customers9
 by segregating their securities and cash from the 
broker-dealer’s proprietary business activities. If the broker-dealer fails financially, the 
securities and cash should be readily available to be returned to the customers. In 
addition, if the failed broker-dealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), the securities and cash would be 
isolated and readily identifiable as “customer property” and, consequently, available to be 
distributed to customers ahead of other creditors.10) 
So regs said "hey assholes you are not allowed to do x" and completely different party said " Hey these assholes just did x, are you aware of this" The SEC "Tell them assholes stop, freeze all funds and open the doors cause we are on the way" and by doing this losses were mitigated, damages were contained and the depositors made whole. 
Apply to gox, the second a bank saw gox money, from the customers account into the personal account, the SEC would step in and say "Hey asshole, you see this? You can't do that shit dog" an immediate audit would begin and then depositors would get the money back. Now 100% is HIGHLY UNUSUAL, but 70%, 50% etc... thats still not bad.

Except for banks. From what I'm reading she seems like she wants to be a clearing house, and in that situation she needs control, centralization, and priority. So she may very well be looking to move in, boot everyone to bitcoin 2.0 and just use bitcoin 1.0 for her personal intra bank system. She doesn't have to cover developer costs, can probably make some rental agreement with the mining pools, that insures they have a consistent and steady revenue stream to keep them profitable and running (unlike the uncertainty of mining for a market price) and she can charge banks to use her network, for a much smaller amount that normal clearing and she bypasses all regs, as no money is transmitted.

Like I said, she doesn't want or need you. She wants her and her bank cronies. And as long as they can make money they don't care... They didn't care in 2000, or 2008. If she wants the blockchain to use as a bank to bank transfer system, then you are a liability, and she will get rid of you however she can. If she has to pay higher fees in the short term to prevent anyone else from processing transactions she will do it. If she has to build a mining farm she will do it. Her intentions are not to leave the blockchain unchanged. She doesn't care about the "vision" for bitcoin, she doesn't care about the unbanked, hell she doesn't even care about the price of a bitcoin. She wants this tech, why not create her own? That I don't know. I can guess, but I will assure you that it doesn't involve joe public.

Who says it has to be a BTC fee? Don't miners get to choose which transactions are included in the block? If its me I go to antpool and say "hey each time you include my zero fee transaction in your mined block I will give you 400" The pool owner gets to keep the fee + his share of the hashing reward, the members of the pool have no idea what happened, her transactions aren't discernible from normal zero fee transactions, she only needs a few satoshi.    
Basically, you do all the work, I get all the profit and no one can tell the difference.

No I'm saying that a business has to take things into consideration, and that opportunity is not what makes or breaks a business, but having some type of competitive advantage will. Yes maybe a business would have benefited from getting a domain name in the early 90's, and forgoing phone books, and maybe that might have paid off in the future. Or maybe a well run business could sit back and wait, let the others waste their resources figuring it out, and then come in a little later, learning from the mistakes of the pioneers! A business that goes into every venture because "OMG if we miss this we will be irrelevant" is a business that's bound to fail, and on the flip side a business that waits to long will do the same. 
A case in point Enron, no not the fraud aspect, but the Blockbuster deal to deliver streaming movies directly to your house that was in 2000 (very early), which wasn't done by netflix till 2007 (mighty late and if not done it would have bankrupted the company). The deal was a colossal cluster fuck, in no way would it have worked out at that point in time, but now it would be stupid to own a video service that doesn't stream movies (Ex Blockbuster)  


And he was FUCKING right, wasn't he!!!!

Who needs you or anyone else in the market to do business with? What if I bring in me and my own clients and pay a high tx fee and effectively stop any transaction that isn't mine from hitting a block. I don't even need it 24/7 I need it for 40 hours a week, and you can play after 5 once I close, but while I'm open its only me, cause I'm paying the highest fees. How attractive is bitcoin to a user now? Hell if you're a miner I'll even buyback the BTC fees from you for 5% over the market. 
Sure it costs me more in the short run, and the bitcoin arms race will continue, but at a point in time, it only becomes valuable for you to mine my blocks. My fees plus my 5% buyback will insure that. So the miners turn off at night. Now I own the network. Its mine, if I want a code change I'm going to get it. If you're a miner and you don't like it, take your ASIC's elsewhere, and call me when you go bust and I'll buy those ASIC's from you, for nickels, or stay and play ball and make some easy money. 
What exactly stops this from going down? Maybe the miners revolt in the beginning, sure that's possible, and I guess my plan would be fucked at this point. However what do you honestly feel in your heart is most miners prime concern: 1) profit 2) philosophy? One of those pays the bills. The way mining is right now, I know there margins are tight, and I know most of them have purchased new equipment that needs to see some type of financial return. Maybe it would cost to much, its expensive sure, at least in the short term, but if my bank to bank transfers can be done faster and cheaper than current clearing houses its a necessary price.

Would it matter? What if I buy out AntPool and the understanding is that I will pay out 700K per day based on hashrate. (I looked at blockchain.info and it appears they had 93 blocks * 25 coins * 300 price) That should keep most people in pool, as they will be making more mining for her than for anyone else. Hell from there she could flat out say if we get to 51% the payment goes to 27,000,000 paid out per day. Now I know that would cause miners to flock en masse to her pool. The only threat at that point is if bitcoin goes over 300 per coin, or if she can't get banks using the system fast enough. Seeing as how thats a 9 billion a year expense. You ain't funding that with VC money! Goldman Sachs estimated that bitcoin or blockchain like tech could save as much as 97 billion a year for financial firms. So she can still make a hefty profit, and save banks money, and insure miners are profitable, and ensure that the only mining arms race is the one to get her more hashrate, and her cost is only that 9 bil a year! That sounds like a good deal to me if I'm a miner, and ensuring that they mine 100% of all the blocks would increase everyone's profitability! Its a perfect play on people's greed. I'm thinking most big miners care more about a profit than they do about the principles of bitcoin, but who knows maybe thats flat out wrong.   
Like I said, I don't know her plans, and this is just rampant speculation.

@_date: 2015-03-11 15:13:54


Ah that's right. I was thinking about those mega farms in China and didn't separate that from mining pools.
So change up the scenario a bit. She makes a rental agreement with the larger pools, they hash for her and she pays them a set fee, insuring profitability, and reducing the risk associated with mining at the market rate. She now has priority for her transactions, but maybe she will let the little guys play when her business is slow. This could slow down the network, causing a hardfork, and now she is left in charge of bitcoin 1.0 and effectively evicted everyone to bitcoin 2.0. 
All this is just speculation, I have no clue what her plans are, but it is very clear she is not interested in the principles of bitcoin, she could careless about that. From what I read she wants to create a clearing house for intra bank transfers, and for that to be effective/ faster/ cheaper, she needs to have priority.  
@_date: 2015-03-11 13:43:47

You're right I don't, I'm not up on the techie details, I'm just going from my understanding. From the Wiki






Okay so from the wiki, under this scenario (she buys out 51% of mining hashrate) Could she not stop any transaction other than her's from getting confirmations? Would this not create a major problem with bitcoins? Also wouldn't see be able to effectively stop all other miners from mining making mining worthless? Now she has rendered the users (other than herself), and the miners (other than herself) useless? In this scenario, she could then use the blockchain, for her own personal gain (bank to bank) transfers, cut out everyone else from the system? It seems to me like right now is the perfect time to do this. She gains enough power that the cost to take the network back would be way to high, but the network is big enough to provide the security that she needs and the timing is perfect! Think about it, too early, and other miners can spin up operations, and take back control, too late and other miners become to cost prohibitive to take over. With the recent price drop, right now is perfect as most miners are probably just breaking even or maybe even operating at a loss. She gets a tested infrastructure, with name recognition, and can use it for bank to bank transfers, all for pretty cheap!   
Now I could be missing something, I'm not a techie and don't know all the details and that's why I'm here asking a serious question. She doesn't seem like the bitcoin type 


“There is a school of libertarian ‘visionaries’ who want to imagine a world without big banks, big governments,” said Ms Masters, who left JPMorgan last April. “That’s nice, but completely irrelevant to this business model. We don’t imagine a world in which big banks and big governments don’t exist.”
So it seems to me like she has an angle and a plan, that doesn't line up with bitcoins core!!!!

She doesn't need to worry about double spends. She will pay a higher fee for her transactions than anybody else thereby crippling private use. She will be the only one using the blockchain, and my guess is, she will start picking up mining pools as they go bust, after a certain point in time, she will own the entire thing. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:20:34
I have no idea, I don't know what her plan is. I doubt anyone will until its too late  She could be completely loopy and have dreams of super gluing all the bitcoins in the world together!? Maybe she is Satoshi, and is going to use those coins (that would be fucking hilarious by the way). Or maybe she will buy up enough market coins to pay the fees. Hell for all we know she might go to the major mining pools and pay them cash if they agree to always include her transactions with zero BTC fees? Honestly I don't know. I doubt she will be buying them up on the market as that will cost more, and I don't have a clue what she has in store, or if it will work. But she knows banks are weary of bitcoin because of things like Silkroad, and her plan is to use this for bank to bank transfers. I seriously doubt a bank is going to want to associate itself with something like that. Also she has to know that a double spend becomes more likely as the amount of money increases. So that tells me she has some plan to control the system, in some way shape or form. Surely she is aware of the risks or things like lost keys or sending something to the wrong address, which again could be fixed if she was in control. 
EDIT: Turns out her ex has been into bitcoin big time, and they started this thing over a year ago. Maybe they have been buying coins this whole time, and now they have enough, or maybe they won the marshals auction.

What is she trying to do? Here is a guess and I want you techie nerds to help me out here. What is to stop her from spamming the shit out of the blockchain with small transactions, but with higher fees than anyone else? Wouldn't this effectively mean that the blockchain is useless to private entities? From there she can simply buyout enough miners to get 51% and after that, she can do what ever she likes? She gets a free intrabank transfer system, and the infrastructure to boot, and all of that for dirt cheap!

If she is able to processes enough transactions, with high enough fees, she could render bitcoin worthless.

That is by far the worst of all possible ways to handle a high level resignation. You better take charge and make sure the narrative that the COMPANY wants is the first thing people hear. Right now people are free to believe whatever they want, and your lack of making a public statement (which you just made) doesn't help anything. 
Bigger companies plan these things out weeks/ months ahead of time, and they release the first statement of what is going on and why. 
EDIT: Since you have changed points one and two why not change point 3


Are you saying your CEO is going to be wearing two hats? CEO/CTO? That might be fine but I would seriously question which job he is spending the majority of his time with. A CEO/CFO might be acceptable in a small/mid size company, but it's certainly not preferable. Also if you have been planning this for two months how do you not have the replacement already decided? This is like step 2 of a resignation, so you can announce who is replacing whom at the same time.

Correct me if I'm understanding this wrong, but they are short about 2 Mil, and JUA gives them a non-interest loan of 1000 (~300K) BTC, in exchange for equity? Exactly how much equity and exactly when is this 1000 loan due? Exactly how much of BTER's own money are they going to be pouring into paying back customers? Do they even have any? 


So they are giving up 1/2 of gross revenue? and all of the net income? Are there expenses that low that they can afford to take a 50% cut on gross? If so that's impressive, but I probably wouldn't advertise that fact. 


What businesses? Seems like they should focus on making sure THIS business is done right first, and with what money? They obviously don't have any money to spend on new ventures, otherwise why not use that to pay back losses? 


So the plan is long term borrowing to pay off short term losses? That doesn't sound like its going to be successful. But hey weirder things have happened, like a loan for an insolvent company in exchange for equity (I'm still blown away by that one).

Peter schiff the master of the Soon^tm.
Price stability is a very good thing. Schiff is a shit head, 2% up every year is stable... 2% up, 3% down, flat, flat 3% up is not stable. The reason price stability is good is so that business and indivduals can plan. For example I'm currently auditing a company that builds massive fuck off oil rigs. From the time it gets a order (that alone takes a year or 2) til the time the rig is ready for use is around 4-6 years. This company would be crushed if the price of steel was 1.70 per lb, then 1.60 per lb, then 2.50 per lb. What they know is that (all things considered) steel will be 1.00 per lb yr1, 1.02 per lb the following, 1.04 the next and so on. They can insure that the contracts they are signing are profitable given the normal expectations. If prices were all over the place it would be a crap shoot as to how much these rigs would cost, and they would have to do it on a year to year basis. Exxon might not want the rig if steel is 1.10 per lb, because it might not be profitable at that point, additionally they might order a second rig if the price was 1.02 per lb. So stable prices help people make contracts, and help insure those contracts are profitable for all parties involved. This is especially true the longer/ more costly, the contract is. Small fluctuations on large contracts or over a long time, can be very very very costly. 
As an example, say I issue a 500,000 5% bond, interest paid semi annually, to yield 7% how much cash could I be reasonable expected to collect today?

Maybe your question is backwards? Why would overatock sell for a 35% diacount? Maybe they have a vested intrest in pimping bitcoin? Maybe B&amp;N is like "meh its a book and this is our markup"
@_date: 2015-02-11 17:20:06


So what.... Bitstamp is just able to print 5 mil? SOMEBODY lost money, maybe it was the company, maybe it was the sharehodlers but someone lost. 


I would say thats the fault of BTC24 for not making sure they were in full compliance, before embarking on their banking endeavors. 


And Bear Sterns and Lehman money was invested in MBS and CDO's not Fiat. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:07:12
Oh ouch, was it even in context or was that like the last thing he said as he was leaving. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:45:25
Or maybe he's just the same guy running the same con's and seeing bitcoin makes his eyes teary with joy at the thought of a fresh market to scam. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:00:10
I'll tell you like my HR person told me, when she helped me redo my resume. Show me, don't tell me! It's assumed that you can think critically (especially true if you're a professional) what you should do is  show a way in which you thought critically. For example: Designed a testing measure to insure that, company servers were not being used for illicit hosting. Now that doesn't sound like much from a computer tech guy, but as an auditor people take note of that (People think I'm a computer guru because I can use VBA.... yeah its sad I know). Plus this gives you and the interviewer something to talk about. 
Now I get it, for a little bio blurb that's not really going to cut it, but their has to be SOMETHING better, even nothing would be better.  
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:27:37
When I see the words "critical thinker" in someone's bio I'm genuinely vicariously embarrassed. Can you really think of nothing better? Might as well say "I'm a human" or "I can count". It's really fucking sad when "critical thinker" is on your CV.    
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:39:34
Nothing ever has anything to do with bitcoin apparently. Mt Gox...Nothing to see here. NEOBEE... Nope not bitcoin, BFL... Nah, BTC24... No, Bitcointia... No, BitStamp... Nope, Cointerra... No, KYC... N to O. 
But you know what. Its totally the fault of FIAT when BoA or JPM pulls its fucking stunts. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:41:19
They it will never be used. Can you imagine a vendor that would take bitcon and then have to wait 12-36 hours to get his money... Shit Visa is faster than that. Plus with a market cap of 2bil its not hard to manipulate. Shit one of my favorite stocks had 17bil go through just yesterday... And thats just one stock. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:22:32
No it doesn't, you can bury a vault full of cash somewhere in the world and its the same thing. 
Give us the money. 
No 
Fine stay here until you do
Civil contempt of court could land you in jail to perpetuity, and back. One way or another if you have it and they want it, they will get it. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:48:46
Funny someone said that about 171.00
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:27:11
No worries
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:23:46
Dude bitcon is in the press right now as the defacto currency for: Mobs, kiddy porn, drugs, tax evasion.... Save your breath and quite possibility your job. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:35:48
the volatility alone is destroying any credibility it had. I wouldn't be able to batch sales until the end of the night so even if I priced according to USD/BTC I would still be losing my shirt right now. If I was in a market with thin profit margins IE: Fast food, Clothing, etc.. I would be done for. 
Not to mention all the scams, theft etc... that is already out there. I can't think of one reason why a reputable business would want to engage with such a shady practice. 
I think its an awesome idea, and worth looking into. I just don't think this is the right one.  
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:43:12


And unfortunately that's exactly why bitcoin will never be more than a niche market. Deflating currency is really bad for debts
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:00:40
LOL yeah let me break out my codex of Japanese laws on underground currency. Face it, you fucked up and got sucked into this libertarian wet dream and you got burned because of it. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:31:04
then you don't want to answer questions like "How do you know about a currency that is used for drugs, kiddy porn and tax evasion" Do you? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:54:34
Probably not because going short requires a margin to operate, and you would be crazy to have bitcoin on margin
Edit options will be first
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:21:20
Oh, looks like bitcoin is going bye bye
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:10:25
I have not.... I also make my money slow and steady. I don't need to risk it all at a casino. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:29:31
No trust me no big firms are gambling client money on this.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:28:38
And BTC isn't money either...lol 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:46:55
Don't ask for financial advise on reddit. Thats rule number one/

never try to avenge a defeat with a victory... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:28:39


Just stop.... That's, that's just stupid on so many levels. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:34:44
can you link to that website, all the ones I'm finding are offline and I'm really loving the implosion
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:36:47
Which makes it totally useless to 99% of the people in the world. I'm not fucking around with this shit so some cleaver hacker can jack my shit. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:27:47
I'm with you... I've been laughing my ass off at this all week long. Fucking morons trying to run with the big boys. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:37:03
Oh that will be rich. An infinity divisiable currency with minimums....
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:11:15
Lol okay sport whatever you say
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:33:14
you can only claim gambling losses to the extent of winnings, and actually I'm not sure the IRS would let you claim it as a capital gains/loss but IDK.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:28:34
MTGOX is down and bit24 is looking like a scam
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:11:47
Maybe they should be governed by a board, and have a chairman nominated by the president? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:35:33
I see about all of those rules being broken here
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:02:34
BEST GODDAMN ARTICLE IVE EVER SEEN IN THIS SUB. Seriously. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:08:12
Dont catch a falling knife. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:39:35
Comparing bit coin to APPL? I think you're a tiny bit overrating this whole thing 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:36:46
I can agree with everything you said except everything after "I"  
EDIT: If your having such trouble with chargebacks stop doing such a  shitty job of running a business 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:11:39
that is awesome.... I love this panic right now.... people are literally losing their shit.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:20:46
ZERO faith, this is horrible and everyone should just get out while they still can; 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:12:12
Exactly... now your getting it. This is why governments don't have deflationary currency 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:19:48
Only to the extent of your gains 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:17:04
lol.... How about I'm a dumbass who bought an internet coin, that was unregulated, uncontrolled and traded through a shitty magic the gathering website... No, no, none of that... It MUST BE THE CIA.... Dumbass 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:56:46
So were into conspiracy theories now. How about a 1000% rise that had no underlying economic background suddenly gave way when no new buyers could be found.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:48:18
You should probably rethink your business strategy. Are you batching these things for sale or instantly? If your batching them then good luck getting the right price. Also whats your back up in case your computer shits out?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:24:47
Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:48:41
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:14:16
"High yield bonds"...lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:48:39
but...but....free markets man. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:06:45
Why would you spend your coins? And why does a legal merchant want to accept this
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:11:46
Yeah thats the spirit ban people who speak out against this horseshit. Why not ban the assholes who ran the price up. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:50:44
between 65 and 75 is not what we would call stable, thats a 13% swing... You really should look into other currencies to see how much they swing on a 5 year basis 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:58:48
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:05:52
That sucks sorry dude
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:02:06
Its not like those other times....gee where have I heard this before
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:16:50
drugs.... thats it
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:48:03
But...but...the fed
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:44:01
Yeah people who bought an unbacked unregulated currency for quick gains will all the sudden become rational. We call it a dead cat in the trading world. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:06:51
It will continue to fuel a sell off, look at those other markets crash and burn. I'm bids come in at 78 and getting filled
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:54:57
"Hey we need more market liquidity" 
"FUCK WTF ARE THESE HFTS DOING HERE!!!!!!"
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:50:45
cause people here don't know shit about shit, you might as well ask someone you meet on the street. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:32:25
That's another issue that I never even though about...
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:38:21
Yeah bubble round 2
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:15:18
Nope not at all. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:35:01
Lol "three hours around 60-70 is totally stable guys go for it" You guys should really learn something about stability. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:31:53
I wonder how many actual traders are here right now. I heard about this scam a week ago and the comedy here is priceless.... Spartans hold!!! HAHAHAHAHA I about shit myself... 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:08:53
Nope just a skeptic who sees this for what it is, a  bullshit pump and dump scheme. Hopefully I can keep one person from losing their shirt in this horseshit.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:08:33
You mean like a central authority that could inject money into the system to hold asset values.... where have I heard something like that?
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:37:36
Hmmm... thats funny, the only time I've ever heard of one is when some really scummy shit is going down. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:48:12
Since they just released their own version of bitcoin....no... There is a serious independence issue there. They are not audited as far as I can see, we have no idea what, or how many bitcoins they are holding... These are all rules that the normal markets use a for good reason. MTGOX makes its money off of transactions so starting panics and booms makes them rich and no outside independent parties have even bothered to look at them.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:47:48
LOLOLOLOLOL thats too funny. Yeah you got burned by and unregulated currency on an unregulated market not backed by a central authority and now you want to cry? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:13:24
Hey at least they convinced Congress to bail them out with your money. And at least they can run a fucking exchange unlike these monkeys trying to fuck a basket ball
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:28:37
Is anyone even sure that Mtgox is not artificially pumping the price? Do they get audited?  
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:35:47
Me and you both... I'm SOOOOOOO FUCKING BORED TODAY!!!! Quick someone find me some work. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:21:27
You got a POS system that can check people out in bit pay? We just spent 40K on ours. How do I keep my accountant from running off with all my anonymous money? How do I value it on a BS or P/L? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:37:51
What website is this
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:26:27
And....Its gone. That sucks sorry guys but these unregulated markets are prime for scammers. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:36:26
Best post ever in this fucking sub
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:19:58
What are the benefits for me as a merchant? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:36:28
HOLY SHIT!!!! Cash out get what you can and be done with this nonsense. Next time go talk to a financial planner. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:41:01
Wait okay its back...whew...I given it ten min 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:55:05
Ah thank you. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:52:47
Looks like a lot of people lost a lot of money. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:16:34
But that comes with a considerable cost and that makes visa/mc start to look like better options
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:23:43
Deflationary spirals cause people to not stop consuming and hoard cash because the risk free rate of return is so high. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:26:28
Gee an unregulated currency that's primarily traded on a *MAGIC:The Gathering* website....OMG who could have forseen this.... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:11:28
where are you getting this information. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:40:15
I'm bored at work, and I'm hoping other people will start avoiding this scam/
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:31:57
Yeah no one would go for that. If you tried that in any other market your ass would be roasted. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:05:50
This is the inherent problem with any fixed exchange. Its exactly why no country uses this model.  
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:52:29
Try to go to it
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:25:20
OHHHHH You said 149
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:45:35
Because this is not what stable currencies are supposed to do. They are supposed to stay stable
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:23:40
okay the housing market dropped 30% over 2 years and look what that did, and you see a 73% drop as a "setback" 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:47:03
Sooooo.....bubble number 2? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:04:44
Sounds like your friend knows his shit
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:14:23
Welcome to the real world. Ride the waves or clear the line and let the real traders do what we do best.     
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:17:54
you are barking up the wrong tree. I've been trying to get people here to see this for the past year, and to no avail. We haven't even factored in the nature of debt to deflationary currency yet, and to those who say "Pssh! debts the problem to begin with"... Wrong, just plain wrong... 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:58:56
Until they pop, and all it takes (especially with this small of a market), is a nasty rumor to get around
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:08:07
Not to mention the security risks hackers etc.... but you have nailed it. Until you have the infrastructure this wont work
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:43:28
Okay, whatever you say. To me it says "He he I got a shit load in bitcoins now I'm going to let the public know so that they get interested and I can safely jump ship" 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:43:13
No, its really not... The major exchanges have circuit breakers and the amounts are know and announced WAY in advance. With this exchange its just willy nilly, they can turn them off when they want turn them on when they want and for all you know they are filling there own orders first. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:57:49
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:53:09
Unregulated markets what did you expect 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:29:35
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:59:06
I love it here Ive haven't seen so much irrational thought in a long time..
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:53:05
Oh and they are chargeing you for the upgrade
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:56:07
that would be my advice. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:31:04
Wait 1% on my POS? is that gross or net? I get visa at 2%, so why would I want to get hit 1% on POS and 2% Visa, and how much do they charge to change it to USD and deposit it into my bank? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:42:10
It would be fiat backed by fiat, fiatception....
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:54:00
buy on value not on price. If you think its worth 200, fine buy until that point. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:53:16
And this is the exact attitude that will make uncle sam destory bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:39:03
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:52:04
And its back up
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:16:32
No...fuck no....run away from this fucking scam
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:24:29
Herro? oh you want to make an order prease! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:14:35
Lol forex trades 3trillion a day.... one billion...lol
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:47:45
Bitstamp is at 60, the low is 55 and the high is 98. who the shit knows
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:49:34
Very likely. Its worthless and people are just speculatively throwing money around like regards at a candy shop
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:47:38
Not really and the 1-2 from visa mc is because they have a Rep, and a shit load of consumer protection laws
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:37:59
And its down
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:53:44
Because: Irrational Exuberance... 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:04:54
Assuming they haven't cancelled in this wave
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:14:59
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:07:52
dude if you need a counter argument for why these two are completely different I can't help you. Okay one thing, can you please produce the B/S P/L for MtGox? Can you tell me who the top shareholders are? Can you produce an audited ISO 9000? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:17:01
Um yes it is. That's why I spend all day doing foreign currency translations and the price differences are extremely small
 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:57:06
...then you lose your shirt cause everyone realizes its just a scam except for the rabid libtards who don't know dick about shit...  
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:33:42
Enron looked the same, tulip bulbs. It never changes
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:06:47
No its worthless because 1BTC=1BTC and people simply assigned whatever value they wanted to it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:58:03
No... Bitcoin is unregulated (right now) and therefore it doesn't fall under the SEC act, but if it did then yeah you could file a report with the justice department and they would file criminal charges. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:41:17
WOW can we say delusional? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:59:52
Yeah and I want APPL to shoot back to 900.00 but it doesn't work that way. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:23:19
Okay so an international currency that has trading hours
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:21:05
So I was looking at volume history and it would appear bit 24 was the second largest tradeing site... how much money are we talking? Couple thousand or couple million
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:15:11
GOD!!!!! Look if you don't know how this works you really shouldn't be in an EXCHANGE!!!!!! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:42:10
SEC, FBI... etc. Investments have laws they have to follow. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:34:37
Yeah no, I'm not touching this shit ever. Clear out and be thankful you still have your shirt/. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:32:55
Or the fact that the press is presenting it as a tool for downloading kiddy porn and for people buying drugs and tax evasion. Talk about painting yourself with a big X for the IRS 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:41:11
Okay quick point, people like Kevin O'leary don't make a prediction like "Oh I'm buying X" Unless they have already secured a contact in X...  
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:18:24
Oh so now we want a regulated market...lol
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:13:35
It needs to stay put for months to years for big vendors to take it seriously 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:13:44
I'm sure he's not but its the nature of deflationary currency. Only 21mil will ever be in existence. So lets say I boot my comp and lose 500 coins to cyberspace, the value of the remaining coins will increase. Guys this is basic supply and demand econ here. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:40:12
At least I can go buy a burger today with my "fake" currency.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:04:37
You mean 1000% swings up followed by constant saings of 50% are not normal? ???? Well paint me skeptical but im going to need a source
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:12:05
that was yesterday, now comes the free fall 
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:15:03
Sounds like a classic kiting scheme unfortunately
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:09:50
Or maybe he just got in at the ground floor on the greater fool theory? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:05:15
The only things ive seen on it is how its used for kiddy pornography, drugs, tax evasion...
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:13:51
Okay, "Spartan" 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:42:55
Well in that case you better be willing to fork over a shit load of money. However remember the exchange is only as trustworthy as those running itl 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:42:14
but.... but.... the feds? and don't forget the JOOZZZZZZZ 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:20:24
Oh WOW.... Sell now everyone..
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:54:54
150? I'm watching them fly out the door at 80.00

Dude I'm a trader. I make my money on the rise and cashed out before this shit fest hit. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:42:41
No this does affect you, cause those people are throwing the entire system under the bus. It looks rickety and unstable and good luck getting vendors to accept this stuff .
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:27:56
Umm cause maybe I can convince one delusional person to be more rationally with their money. 


Why so you can echo chamber your way back to 250.00
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:00:38
Are you serious, seriously? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:12:13
Sure it does that's the nature of deflationary currencies. If someone lost a wallet containing 5Mil in bitcoins the value would shoot through the roof. 
And don't even get me started on deflationary currencies coupled with debt..,. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:44:24
Probably not. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:26:25
TOOT TOOT to zero we go.... 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:59
no its not, I'm absolutely sure that it costs you something to change your currency back and forth, not to mention all the security issues. IE some accountant running off with your untraceable money. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:27:25
It is a deflationary currency that does encourage hoarding. Why would you buy a car today if you could wait tomorrow and get the same car cheaper? There is a reason no country uses a fixed currency.   
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:07:56
Yeah those are objective opinions... "I mine bitcoin"
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:35:38
This is what people have been saying for years with a fixed currency, boom and bust. Bitcoin is nothing new. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:21:46
Tell that to those poor bastards who bought in north of one hundred
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:49:52
Oh no I already made my money on the run up and the bounce I'm off the table. As far as I'm concerned this thing can go the way of pokemon cards. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:41:04
Wait are you guys bitching about unregulated markets? Ah the irony 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:15:26
Wow so its worse than cash, and credit cards? Who is honestly buying into this? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:41:19
And its back offline
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:10:39
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:58:49
Sooooo. stop taking it.... Tell him his money is no good here and take the sign down. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:58:16
Its like watching a shitty boxing match lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:00:06
I'm watching the buys come in at 140 with the sells at 106.00 which is not a good sign, as some of those will turn around and immediately sell. A 24% instantaneous loss of 25% is hard to stomach.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:45:26
What? you have heard of the great depression right? or Tulip mania or the housing bubble? Yeah people panic sell all the time. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:44:53
then clear out while you can, count your loses and move on. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:59:03
Its the JOOZZZZ
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:13:49
This is not going to make it better. Only worse, if I was in I would dump as soon as they were back up/ 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:52:15
Beanie babies
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:59:26
Good point... 
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:42:49
??????????? Are you seriously? ????????? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:35:52
Didn't they just release there own currency? So in effect this would be expected. I think we are getting ready for the dead cat bounce
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:37:16
Yeah I'm well aware of the differences, but daily volume is a shit load smaller than market cap always will be
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:18:23
You lying little shit, thats about japan not bitcoins... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:57:42


Bingo, don't listen to fucktard libertarians who don't know shit about econ.. 
 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:51:42
And down
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:36:55
Seriously this shit has no value and yeah it can go down just as far as it went up. Sell now and get out with what you've got. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:19:02
Wait what... I'm agreeing with you. Just pointing out the HURR DURRR THERE NOT SMART attitude 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:12:54
No worries, but honestly there is really no reason to take it. If you want to support the community great. Do you think that rational will stand up with JP morgan, or Sears? They are in it to make money and the risks of them losing .50C on a speculate bet would kill there stock. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:23:09
This is the nature of fixed exchanges, boom and bust. Its all happened before and its happening again right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:25:54
Okay clearly you don't understand what we mean when we say regulated 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:53:09
Unless they were executing the buy orders and no sell orders. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:26:16
They will start confiscating assets that you are purchasing, and prosecute you for bankruptcy fraud. It would be really hard to explain where you got the money to buy a new car with no income. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:25:46
Who would have though a unregulated untraceable currency on an unregulated untraceable company might steal your shit...Wait for shocked face... 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:00:31
I would upload a code of kiddy porn into the string there by making it illegal to download
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:19:07
Okay those rich people are trying to figure out a way to short sell and make money. They don't give two shits about bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:00:38
Only if you want to lose that dollar.... lol did you really? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:49:36
Are you serious? Do I honestly have to explain fractional reserve banking to you?  
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:12:43
Looks like its up to me
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:02:58
The best was the guy yesterday saying that we needed some type of reserve to step in a buy up a bunch to help the price stabilize.... I seriously almost pissed myself from laughing at that one
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:20:58
I would get out...this is a very bad sign. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:38:38
Yeah fees will increase. As it gets bigger more and more severs/security are going to be needed, plus its going to start coming under regulatory fire. I don't think Visa and MC would sit back and watch either, 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:03:29
That sounds great but I usually pay around 1-2% and run VISA/MC and my customers trust them, they are easy to work with. I don't have to worry about the accounting department running off with all my money overnight and it being untraceable. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:22:03


I think you misspelled credit...
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:32:58
the people who bought in at &gt;50, they are making a return. You I presume are losing money. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:45:32
Okay, lol... 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:41:55
sounds like nonsense to me, good luck trying to explain that shit to grandma
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:21:27


Whatever you say warren buffett 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:46:52
DOW 36000 God I remember that book, and sadly people took it seriously
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:56:24
They didn't, check the metrics almost none of the money came from Cyprus but from americans  
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:06:17
400 Million....lol 
FOREX trades 3trillion a day.... lol
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:34:29
Yeah cause a 100,000 percent increase sounds feasible 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:02:52
For what? You being a jackass and buying into this scam
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:36:01
Hahahahahahahaha next you'll want a board of governors.... next you'll want a chairman appointed by the president....lol this is why we have a central bank retard 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:42:35
Dude can you seriously imagine if sony released its financials with the footnote, we lost money do to some new type of currency thing? The markets would literally flip the shit out. You dont make money by losing it 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:48:34
I don't have a boss. Ah freedom! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:11:53
What's the three year comparison, I bet its still pretty close. And sure as shit a lot closer than high 266 low 63
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:17:33
How about not putting your shit on the Internet in the first place
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:39:08
Wow buying high and selling low.... Gotta watch that bid/ask spread.... lol silly day traders/ 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:22:16
I'm watching the other websites crashing under the weight and hearing rumors of breachs in Btc-e.... Going down, get out while you can. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:04:09
You have legal recourse so long as the SEC, FBI etc... have jurisdiction, they don't have that in Bitcoin, which is what makes it so dangerous, and the reason no one is going to take it seriously. If they ever do gain the recourse then bitcoin becomes worthless as it will no longer be anonymous, and will have a shit ton of fees attached to it, so that the markets are in compliance. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:30:37
No because they sold at 260.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:42:26
because I aint got shit to do right now... I'm stuck at work and bored as shit so here I am to laugh. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:19:15
LOL its called the FDIC 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:48:43
I would be out, it will take a ton of time to recover to 170 if ever. Use it as a lesson. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:33:35
Sucks to be you, this is where the money is. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:23:24


The only way I as a vendor would be willing to accept bitcoin is the other way around. If I can sell those for 500 why would I sell them for 350 and hope the price increases?
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:35:28
Seriously???? That would be so awesome
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:12:04
I for one am worried about the deflationary nature of bitcoin can you speak to that?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:01:40
I was thinking stupid people with money
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:59:54
You obviously don't know how markets work...  
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:16:57
On its website 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:40:11
Omega guise pres Romney's in on bit coin hes got shit loads of money...right, guise
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:30:19
No it means you should count your losses and move on. Or hold your bitcoins until you have stock gains and then write them off 
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:19:03
Can we confirm if anyone has actually been contacted? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:48:43
A little bit complex. You have to send them id then transfer money
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:32:00
Maybe if you put it in meme form it will all be okay? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:07:51
Yeah and those 90's beanie babies are a great hold of value too right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:12
Why would I, a legit business owner want to accept a form of payment that is going to paint a target on my ass for the IRS? Why would I want to transact B2B in bitcoin (lets face it this is where is money is at) when cash works just fine? The only reason "anonymous" transactions are popular is because of people doing things that create a need for it to be "anonymous" (tax evasion, drugs, porn etc...) other than that its worthless to me and the risk is HUGE!!!! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:36:44
So now we want a regulated market....lol 
PS this is why the big boys have regulators. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:05:55
Good for you. Cut your losses and move on
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:54:16
Really? Before 2010? That's some bullshit. I had to wait a week to validate... lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:11:14
Good point, good currency is only as good as the exchange. If this shit was happening in any other financial market it would be doomed. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:36:06
Do you have any idea how much money ETFs throw around in the penny stocks???? Two bil market cap is shit
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:07:36
No I didn't lose anything, I know what this is and its silly.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:57:36
Yeah, okay... Whatever you need to tell yourself to make it hurt less 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:58:00
There is very little volume be careful
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:58:17
It cant this is the problem with fixed exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:00:56
I do not. I'm out.... If this thing is really going to take off there will still be a ton of money to be made later. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:56:22
Relatively? what are you talking about? Home values dropped 30% at there max, and you consider a 40-50% drop stable? are you mad? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:57:39
Looks like some one is cashing in big time.
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:35:19
Yeah they can and do prosecute bankruptcy fraud. All it takes is one tip, or one thing that seems outta place a bang, they're on to you. For example if you've had unexplained wire transfers or other sources of income, they will hammer you hard. Its one of the few areas of financial law that is actually policed
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:39:04
No I invest it smart, therefore inflation doesn't bother me and I have some legal recourse in the event of market manipulation.
