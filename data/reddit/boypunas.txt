how would they liquidate on BitMex? They are BTC settled.

I'm curious why would someone only include 1 transaction on a block. Do you know if that is done on purpose?

This is a really excellent Planet Money episode with regards to the recent fiat money control in India.
Worth a listen.

fiat wont go away...same as barter..gold,silver are still acceptable way of exchanging value until today.

we have broken a steep near term trend line..but long term uptrend is perfectly intact. This sell off is healthy and is quite needed for a more stable uptrend in price.

Verizon is definitely at fault here.

I have one word for you...greed. Bitcoin becomes the very thing we want to move away from.

the purpose of crypto currencies is to have these middle men extinct.

kinda weird..here you need to physically go to a service center to have your sim swapped. I'm actually thinking some sort of an inside job.

isn't the whole point of us going to the blockchain is to move out of centralized exchanges that hoard in billions and billions of dollars via fees? Given that they already have billions of money they still see the need to charge us with tremendous fees. Greed is always bad..doesn't matter who's hand it is in.
