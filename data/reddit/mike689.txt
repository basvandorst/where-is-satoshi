Well, it's a pending transaction I made today that is listed as supposed to go through today. Which I've never seen before from an instant transaction.

You aren't even reading what I'm writing... I came here to post what happened to me in the hopes that someone else would say "yes that is happening to me as well" so I could determine if it's an issue they have going on right now or not. I'm not looking for customer service. I'm not looking for anyone to solve anything for me. Jesus. Fucking. Christ.
I had the issue and was suggested to post about it here to see if it had happened to anyone else... Remind me not to come back to this sub ever again.

Starting to think that's what's gone on

Whoa... easy there tiger. I've never even posted in r/Bitcoin before and although I know Coinbase is a less than top tier company, it's one I've used because it's one of the few that will let me instantly buy them with debit (Yes I know there are others, I'm waiting to be verified on some of them so I can use them instead). So no, *I* myself have not been warned of anything since I don't lurk this sub...
Also I'm not asking anyone to "clean their mess". Just was wondering if it had happened to anyone else... jesus.

Thank you for that. Good to know not everyone in here is so quick to judge and tell people to leave.

I'm about to go test the card at the gas station on the way to work though, so I guess that will prove whether it's the card or Coinbase

I used the card yesterday to purchase bitcoins from Coinbase. Granted much smaller amounts, but still. It worked.

Worked fine at the gas station. Either it's an issue on Coinbase's side or.my bank is outting a stop on all somewhat high bitcoin transactions.
