EL5 Doesn't congress need to decide the legal status of Bitcoin first? And if it is now in fact "property", like software, does it fall under copyright law? And what about Microsoft? Do they owe ~huge~ taxes because of their Xbox Microsoft points program? That was a virtual currency.

When they ended the MSFT Points program did they give cash credit for remaining unspent points? I don't think I got mine. So technically that is a loss. Also I have seen people trade point cards in the past for all kinds of things in the same way people trade/exchange Bitcoins today. It might not have been authorized by MS but it did happen and still does with monthly membership cards (specifically the codes on the cards - think private keys). My real objection here is that the little guys (a.k.a. the miners) are going to bear the brunt of this new IRS decision while the large guys will skate away.
So, again, I wonder by today's IRS definition of "Virtual Currency" how doesn't Microsoft XBOX Points fall under that definition? And since that program was running in 2013 there should be tax implications. See:

"Q: How did Microsoft determine the amount of currency added to my Microsoft account?
A: To make this a seamless and positive experience for our customers, we have considered many factors to help ensure that the amount added to your Microsoft account is of equal or greater Xbox stores value than your Microsoft Points. The value of Microsoft Points in Xbox stores may not always be equivalent to retail price. Retail price is determined by the Retailer, whereas Xbox stores value reflects the value of Microsoft Points throughout Xbox stores."

I didn't see that type of distinction being made in today's IRS announcement. Why should it matter if it is in a 'closed' ecosystem or an 'open' one? You'll have a hard time convincing me that the IRS doesn't want its cut when anything of value is exchanged. After all World of Warcraft is a 'closed' ecosystem and yet the IRS wants to tax that.

Large banks are most likely putting pressure on emerging markets to avoid Bitcoin since a strong grassroots movement to the use the currency is the one of the biggest and most immediate threats to them. Watch for cut and paste statements like "bitcoin can become a tool for crimes like money laundering, drug trafficking, tax evasion, illegal payment" which carry the fingerprint of J.P. Morgan's earlier statements.
