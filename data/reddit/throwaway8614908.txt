They already rape your phone every time you go through customs, why stop there?

Chip needs contact to be read, but doesn't biometrics make your body your wallet? Face and fingerprints unlock your phone for tap and pay. Not trying to convince you, just don't see much difference.

Ppl be cray. Throwaway over Tor because don't dox me, bro. 
Even if you get the data you gotta decrypt it. Ain't nothing gonna protect my crypto from a circular saw attack. Fire that mfer up and I'll unlock my safe, give you the passcodes for my hardware wallet, PayPal you everything in my account AND draw you a bubble bath while I give your nasty ass a backrub. LMAO.

Proper prior planning doesn't leave you with a single point of failure, m'dude. Chip's not doing anything on it's own and if read they just get a PGP message.

You got it, symmetric. Memorable long af passphrase, entropy over 9000. ;)

That sounds like a terrible idea.

Chillax, g-pa. Wouldn't want to stress your ticker and buy yourself a pacemaker.
It also unlocks my door and logs me into my computer.

xNT. NFC enabled phone + NFC Tools. Transfer the string in .txt to storage media, use the app to write to the tag.
Hardest part is finding the sweet spot on your model of phone where the antenna picks up the chip.
