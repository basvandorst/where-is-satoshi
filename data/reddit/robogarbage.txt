They've shut down a couple access points - why haven't they shut down all of them?  That's my point. 
My point on the difference between 'underestimated' and 'hasn't realized potential' is that they don't need to nip it in the bud. They can always shit it down later if they want to.  It's not a genie that will get out of a bottle. A payment system can always be shut down later, if they want to.

Why don't these guys build a payment processing network that would be useful, rather than an ETF to park cash and take bitcoin out of circulation.  Oh I know why - because that would require technical skills, not just blue blooded contacts.
These guys show the difference between "investing" and parasitic speculation.  Investing means spending money on something useful that will produce something of value.  Parasitic speculation means looking for exciting things people are doing and buying a piece so you can take a free ride on their work.  Vacant neighborhood getting a few cafes and bars?  Buy a building and sit on it for a couple years.  Promising work in a biomed field?  Buy some patents that the researchers might need.  Bitcoins getting some traction?  Buy it up so you can sell it back to users for 100 times the price.

You don't need a real time USD exchange rate because if USD ever had a day as volatile as bitcoin's average day it would be the top headline on every news site.
Also, finance sites (i.e. sites dedicated to money) generally show a bunch of exchange rate and interest rate statistics.
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:46:36
So the ETF doesn't buy and sell, it issues and redeems shares to traders who buy and sell. How is that different?
Note that the basket size would suppress volatility a bit, until a whole basket is assembled. Then there would be a wild swing. So bigger baskets would actually make the volatility discontinuous and unpredictable. Even the level of volatility is volatile!
Guilty on not reading the prospectus.

Exactly right.  Most people who believe in bitcoin are already invested in it.  And some of them would transition from bitcoin to the ETF (if only to get capital gains treatment), putting selling pressure on bitcoin.
As people short the ETF, the ETF would be forced to sell bitcoin to keep its share price at the bitcoin price.  This would create a feedback loop.  The same thing could happen the other way of course.  It would be a huge opportunity for manipulation so the SEC is not likely to approve it.  But it would be a fun thing to watch.  Let's hope the SEC remembers that it's not a babysitter and decides to let boys be boys!

And Bitcoin has no vested interests...
That's why it kind of matters who Satoshi was. Cause millions of bitcoins have never been used. When they make a comeback they'll chop the value of Bitcoin in half (best case scenario - in reality only a small fraction of that number of coins coming on the market would crush the price). 
The vested interests are the ones who work so hard to promote Bitcoin. They're also the reason why, unlike most tech-related threads, there's no discussion on "how can we make the next version better?"  Bitcoiners would lose their investment if a new and improved version came along, so they down vote any discussion of alternatives and rant and rave about how any alternative is impossible, evil or some combination of the two.

It's been known for a while that this was coming sooner or later, so I would think anyone inclined to be shory is already short. 
I wonder if they considered selling them at market. Maybe they didn't want to implicitly endorse any of the exchanges - it would make it politically harder for the IRS or SEC or whoever to shut it down if the Feds also used it.

My original post is solid (except I would clarify that the crash wasn't caused by deflation, it was caused by a Minsky bubble, and the post-crash deflation is what caused the depression).

Would it be possible to set up a software-based collusion system?  Imagine if a huge pool of users credibly commit their bitcoin to the system for a certain period of time.  The system then uses its pool to manipulate the market in whatever way is most profitable.
I don't know how it would work.  But the problem most price colluders have is the prisoner's dilemma (and various variations of it).  This seems like something a blockchain could help with.
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:55:15
The blockchain can confirm transactions quicker and lower cost than a centralized system?  I didn't know that.  I thought it took a while and burned electricity (paid for by people buying bitcoin that is mined).  
@_date: 2014-10-27 06:34:42
I think sidechains are the future for bitcoin.  They'll make it possible to process transactions much quicker.  If they use direct matching (e.g. if they get a buy and sell order at the same time, they could just pair them rather than use an actual bitcoin) then that will be a huge boost to global average transaction velocity.  If they make it possible to use very short-term credit (e.g. for a few hours, maybe with USD collateral), the transaction velocity would be theoretically unlimited.
Using the monetary identity MV=PQ, if the velocity of bitcoins could be increased to an average of one transaction per day per bitcoin, the entire global GDP could be processed in bitcoin at a price of $18,000 per bitcoin.  If the velocity could only reach 0.1 times per day, that would mean a bitcoin price of $180,000 would be required to process all of the world's business.  If only 0.01 times is achievable, that would mean a bitcoin price of $1.8 million.
But the velocity is theoretically unlimited, and people are working to bring theory to reality.  Think on that.

You mention that bitcoin has advantages over gold - that's like saying highways have advantages over parking lots.  Of course they do - they're two different things.  Gold is a store of value.  Bitcoin is a transaction method.  Storing value in bitcoin is like parking your car on the highway, it's not a great parking spot and it interferes with the flow of traffic on the highway.
The biggest cause of volatility in bitcoin is the fact that a huge % of bitcoins are held by speculators/hoarders.  That pushes the price up, but everyone knows that the price could come crashing down at any time if some speculators decide to cash out.  That volatility undermines its usefulness in transactions.  If it's not useful for transactions (e.g. suppose a better system comes along) then it's worthless.
I think the bitcoin system has a big future ahead of it, but I don't think owning original bitcoins is a way to own a piece of it. I don't think there's any way to own a piece of the system, since it's open source.

Congratulations, you've figured out how to operate an economy free from the mechanisms carefully crafted over the years to encourage economic growth and dampen recessions/depressions.
If you can sit on bitcoin and get GDP growth, there is no need to invest in anything.  How would that be good for the economy??
Instead of using the term "saving", you should use the term "hoarding".  In the current economy, saving means putting your money in the bank so it can be lent out to people who will invest it.  You can spend it later (and if the bank goes bust, there's FDIC).  
If "saving" means hoarding, that means the money is taken out of circulation, so GDP goes down (mathematically, it has to).  That's how you end up with a situation where factories sit idle, the workers are outside doing nothing, warehouses are full of raw materials nobody can buy, and would-be customers of the factory aren't buying anything because they're unemployed too, all because the only people with any money are sitting in their mansions laughing, while the rest of the economy can't function because they don't have bitcoins to facilitate commerce.
I'm not doing any of this justice - you should read Krugman's stuff on this.  Or pretty much any economist in the world with any credibility outside of bitcoin circles.  I know Krugman isn't popular here, but if you're a True Believer your faith should be able to withstand him.
In the same vein, I'll happily read pro-bitcoin articles by any Nobel prize winner, successful business person or wealthy investor.  I don't think any such people have come out and said that buying bitcoin is a good investment (aside from the Winkelvoss twins of course), though quite a few are enthusiastic about the technology (I am too).
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:43:01
Most altcoins have failed because it's so easy to make a new altcoin. Why put money into an altcoin when 10 new ones will be made tomorrow. Bitcoin was the first and it initially had no competitors, so it was the first to gain traction and build a network effect. People could be reasonably confident that bitcoins would still be worth something later on. No altcoin has been able to achieve that. 
Bitcoin 2 could be backed by USD. Buy a bitcoin 2 and the money you pay goes into a trust, which will redeem the Bitcoin 2 on request (maybe only in $1 million blocks, to reduce admin costs and to give people an incentive to just sell them on the market rather than redeem). 
The mining problem could be solved through transaction fees. Alternatively, the currency could be inflationary on a controlled schedule. That would not be a problem for people who want to use it for transactions (if you want to store value, buy gold), especially if there's a way to automatically exchange Bitcoin 2 for USD on receipt. 
All of the advantages of Bitcoin that appeal to mainstream consumers would still exist in this system, but it would have price stability. This is nothing but a ledger - Bitcoin is nothing but a ledger, but with a built-in speculative investment. That investment paid off initially, which created a feedback loop of investment and price appreciation, which has made the price extremely volatile and prevented further adoption. That's why the price is so volatile, and it's the main reason many people (including regulators) see the whole thing as a Ponzi scheme.

Fair enough. I don't think it's a scam or that it was started as a way to get rich. But there are people who became extremely rich in Bitcoin who are in a delicate spot because they can't sell even 1% of their holdings without a huge market impact. I wish them well, but at the same time, I want to warn Bitcoin investors, many of whom do not realize the significance of the dormant bitcoins. Still waters run deep...
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:16:04
I meant that partially as a metaphor - the question isn't so much who invented Bitcoin, the question is who controls the uncirculated coins (50-80% of all coins in existence), or more to the point, what are their intentions? I assume they want to cash out but they haven't because demand and supply are precariously balanced at these price levels. A small increase in supply crashes the price, because there just aren't many marginal buyers. The fact that the prisoner's dilemma hasn't forced the issue tells me that it's a person or a coordinated group. 
I would think people who fret about whales with 30K sell walls would be concerned, since these mystery holders could do that 200 times in a row, but there's remarkably little discussion of that on here.

There's a difference between property and real property so it can't be a REIT, but that's OK because it wouldn't produce any income so there's no tax to avoid.  It might be a commodity pool, which is an entirely different can of worms.  
There's no reason why it can't be taxed/regulated like property, a security and a commodity all at the same time, while getting none of the benefits of any of those designations.  
For those reasons and others, setting up a bitcoin fund would be *very* hard.  And there's no sign of mainstream interest in investing in a bitcoin fund, even though there's a lot of interest in blockchain technology and in watching the bubble.
@_date: 2014-11-03 05:18:37
Blockchain technology today is where the internet was in the 90's.  The pioneering internet speculators bought up domain names like computers.com, shopping.com, real-estate.com etc.  Around 2000 the *weak hands* sold their domain names for a few million dollars but the smart ones held on.  And today those smart investors control the market the computers, shopping and real estate markets, respectively.
Edit: I just realized I didn't answer the question.  Look at what the smart money is doing - they're putting millions into sidechains, payment processors, and who knows what else.  They're putting *millions* into that, so the rest of their *billions* is presumably going straight into Bitcoin.  So their allocation is about 99%, so go with that.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:54:58

Tips could also be conditioned on the number of other tips received. That would be useful for crowdfunding situations where a certain amount is needed or else the project won't work.

But you don't have to trust a currency for very long, only long enough to process the transaction and move your value into something else (eg gold, USD, food). The transaction currency is just a transmission mechanism. Storing value in the transmission mechanism for a significant amount of time is risky because supply and demand for transmission capacity varies. The only way to stabilize the price is by letting supply vary.  Side chains and fractional banking will achieve this, and in doing so they'll let the air out of the Bitcoin bubble. That's why blockchain = great technology and Bitcoin = horrible investment.

This would be great if it worked at retail stores, when paying with cash.  That's where change is annoying, who cares about change on credit card purchases.
Maybe a cash register could print a code that could be scanned by a smartphone?  It seems to me that if it's a small amount security doesn't need to be as tight, the software running it could look for patterns e.g. to identify a cashier who's scamming the system.  Getting retailers to install a system would be easier said than done I know.

Good point, I didn't think of the backlash. Maybe a path to securing its future would be to encourage adoption by politically important groups like farmers.  At the same time, helping curb use by those that don't help the cause, like crowdsourcing tracking of flows to drug dealers, would help undermine a case for banning it. That suggestion wouldn't go down smoothly though...
@_date: 2014-11-14 05:02:38
It would be simpler to process transactions on a some-what centralized system (I trust banks, visa and the government enough) so the transaction fees could be very small.  For micropayments, high security wouldn't even be necessary, they could use statistical analysis to find abuse.
The revolution will be a new type of Paypal, with all advantages of bitcoin other than decentralization and anonymity.  Bitcoin will continue to exist, but with very little mainstream adoption.

That article may have been expressing the idea that if the real value of transactions in USD terms stays fairly constant then increasing the number of transactions will reduce the price per bitcoin. For example suppose you want to buy 100 bitcoin worth of stuff from me. You could buy 100 Bitcoin on exchange (pushing exchange rate up) and then send it or you could buy one Bitcoin and send it to me, I receive it and sell it for USD, you bug it back and send it to me again and repeat 98 more times. The second way has very little effect on the market price of bitcoin (except that somebody doing this might realize they can sell their other 99 bitcoin because they only need one).

One problem with this approach is that when a question has a pro-bitcoin answer there's no need to ask it, because people talk about it all the time. Only the hard questions are unanswered.  So a smart person asking questions is likely to appear biased against bitcoin (assuming they've done a bit of reading on the benefits). 
Also, there are a lot of people who are enthusiastic about blockchain technology but who think bitcoin is worth very little.  Are they the trolls to look out for?

Is it possible that neither bitcoin nor debt-based currency is a scam? Or that both are scams?  I don't see why it's one or the other. 
Also, it seems to me that not everyone that is anti-bitcoin thinks it's a scam. There are unwise investments that were conceived with nothing but the best intentions.   Intent is a tricky thing - you collected 56 cents for that comment. If you don't believe it, that makes you a paid shill. If you do believe it, you're not. But your intention has no bearing on whether what you said is logically valid...it's possible to be innocently wrong. It's possible that bitcoin will play out exactly like a Ponzi scheme, even though nobody intended that.

The reason they made it illegal to own gold was because at that time the USD was tied to gold.  The depression was caused by deflation, which gave people an incentive to hoard cash (and gold), which made the deflation worse.  That's one of the reasons why economists say running an economy on bitcoin is a horrible idea.
@_date: 2014-11-04 15:40:25
What people need to understand is that it's possible for bitcoin to be wildly successful, but bitcoin still be worth almost nothing. Side chains will allow recycling of coins for payments. A new altcoin could be backed by USD (or gold or whatever) and still get all the benefits of bitcoin (except total decentralization, but mainstream consumers don't care about that).
Look at domain names. How much is web.com worth today, compared to its value in 2000?  Did the internet not succeed?

If  is a reason, why haven't they started closing access points?  They could start strictly enforcing the money transmitting license requirement.  That would make it very hard for people in a country to start using it (or to their money out of it).  As for shutting down exchanges, remember that exchanges work best when they are bigger.  Two new exchanges opening for any one shut down would make the system less efficient, especially because it would be difficult to transmit money between the two (or to transmit money to an exchange in the first place).
On points  and  it's not so much that it's been underestimated, it's that the potential hasn't been realized.  If it gets big, they will treat it accordingly.
Personally I think only real threat from bitcoin is that it will enable ransomware scams (and worse - kidnappings for ransom).  The credit card system makes it possible to shut down these scams with relatively small losses.  With bitcoin it would be a free-for-all.

This would work for very simple organizations that only need to make yes/no decisions once in a while. "Should the mining company keep mining?", "Should the hosting company keep hosting?" etc.  With anything more complicated than that it would get very tricky.  
For example, owners could be given the options: "A: the company should not add new servers", "B: the company should hire Contractor X to add new servers", "C: the company should hire contractor Y to add new servers" etc.  Problem  what happens if Contractor X owns 51%? Problem  an informed decision would require a ton of research and analysis, which nobody would do unless it was their full time job.  A good solution would be to have professional directors manage the company, and give the owners that ability to vote out the directors if they want to.  That's exactly how regular corporations work...
There are corporations that do nothing but own assets.  Those could be a good application for something like this, but on the other hand the simple decisions they make are generally hard-coded into the organization's operating agreements (which can be changed if a certain % of shareholders demand it, but this pretty much never happens).
This system would be useful for governing a trading "syndicate" that pools together cash and bitcoin holdings and acts as a market maker/trader.  That would be a fascinating thing to see, but I expect it wouldn't end well.

To do this efficiently would require some degree of centralization (unless...sidechains?), but people would always have the option of staying decentralized and doing their transactions the slow old fashioned way, just like how you're free to pay your friend in gold instead of USD if you want to. 
The reason this approach is unpopular here is because it would allow a practically infinite number of transactions to be processed with a very small number of bitcoins. On one hand that makes each Bitcoin very powerful, but on the other hand, it makes 21 million start to look like a very big number...
