Being a programmer irl can truly suck at times so this picture isn't necessarily demeaning. Hobbies ftw!

Does the existence of the (new) middle man result in increased or decreased utility for consumers had he/it not come into being. 
I love how deeply organized peoples' thinking is on here.

Happy to see open discussion on Bitcoin in the US financial press. The Financial Times of London, on the other hand, is another story.

If only the world could continue with national currencies that lose value every year. What a great situation where wealthy people are pushed to fund the building of ugly condominiums to ensure preservation of capital and jobs for people to create copy-and-paste housing to hold families living copy-and-paste lives. 
Gawd forbid that wealthy people withhold their capital until something worthy comes along to invest in like life-extension technology or space migration. But I guess we're a little too focused on building and living in houses so we can keep up with inflation instead of thinking of things like that.
