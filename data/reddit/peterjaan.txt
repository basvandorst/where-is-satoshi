BTC is on track to reaching $60K to $250K by the end of the year. The market is highly volatile so it's very difficult to forecast with any certainty. It can touch $15K or $20K within a day, but it can also stay below these levels for 4-6 months.

So you're a gambler, and that's fine. You will either win big or lose it all (or both). I wish you good luck with your "investment"!
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:26:14
Agreed but is there a decentralized exchange with high enough volume?

Is this your BTC wallet address: "1NZvzpsYNCdhBP16EiDupmFsVKracoRaUM"? It's receiving 3.88226134 BTC from 171 addresses. It's possible that Kucoin is sending your withdrawal in chunks of 0.023 BTC . If you want to see how you are doing, go here: 
You can see that the fee will be sufficient because miner preference is high. I don't believe you can change the transaction in any way since it's not you who is sending the coins (it's Kucoin on your behalf).
The mempool is currently 56 MB ( suggesting that 56 blocks (at 1 MB per block) are waiting to be mined. If one block takes 10 minutes to confirm, it will take 560 minutes or over 9 hours to clear this backlog.
Your 171 transactions (25,266 bytes) might take 16 blocks (at 1,600 transaction per block) or 160 minutes to confirm.

Clickbait. The research is real but mining pools cannot do a 51% attack. Title is sensational.
OP I suggest you keep your politics out of here.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:52:04
Right. I have checked Bisq, it's very lightly used. EtherDelta for the ETH network is better in terms of volume but very difficult to use. Looking at BitShares now...
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:00:59
No one knows for sure. Increased volume will cause BTC to rise. Technical developments could eliminate most of the issues with adoption, leading to higher prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:12:50
Sounds like you don't believe in BTC. You should sell all your coins.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:43:05
I don't think you will achieve much by doing that. Contact support to find out what happened.

On track to $125K by year-end.
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:43:57
Great news
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:42:00
Not weeks... 160 minutes was my estimate, and maximum 560 minutes. 
I see that they are all 6+ confirmed now. Did you keep track of how long it took?
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:58:32
Bitcoin might well be at $100K by year end. I think it will cross $20K in three months.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:40:41
Why don't you ask support? I'm sure they had a reason to do this.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:59:13
Investing all your funds in a single asset (BTC) is very risky. It's much better to diversify as much as possible. It's enough to put $10K into the crypto market because it will be worth at least $100K in a year anyway. Within the crypto market, you need to hold at least 30 coins to reduce your risk to a reasonable level. Betting on a single coin is gambling.

The price per Bitcoin (not share) is $11,312. The change price is -$20 or down by $20 (i.e. it was $11,332).

Agree with Digital Gold and Cryptoassets, they are both great books. Haven't read the other two.

Are you seriously making a prediction based on 4 months of price and volume data?

USDT is designed to be always worth $1 US. If you want to have a cash or cash-equivalent component in your portfolio, holding USDT will achieve that (as long as the coin is stable). You can also transfer funds between exchanges using USDT without having to worry about fluctuating prices of coins. If you think the price of whatever coin will fall, you can sell it for USDT and buy it back when you believe prices are about to rise. These are some of the uses of USDT.
All this of course is hinging on the stability of USDT, so you should read up on this before investing in it.

So Robinhood is not a real exchange but an intermediary between users and exchanges. Do I hear "trusted third party?" Or is it fourth?

You are correct in your observation. However, the Sharpe ratio uses the rate of return and not the average absolute daily change (which is quoted in the article). Here are the real numbers for the Sharpe ratio ("annual" returns are for the 365 days ending on Dec 31; average risk-free return is assumed at 2%):
Risk-adjusted rate of return: 1368.90% - 2% = 1366.90%
Standard deviation: 4.99%
Sharpe ratio: 1366.90% / 4.99% = 274.20
Risk-adjusted rate of return: 121.89% - 2% = 119.89%
Standard deviation: 2.51%
Sharpe ratio: 119.89% / 2.51% = 47.70
Sharpe ratio by the year
2015: 9.03
2014: 15.27
2013: 760.01
2012: 37.55
2011: 157.33
Average SR (since Jul 2010): 160.52
It's hard to detect any sort of a trend even for these 7 data points (let alone the two points in the article). When the SR is charted daily, it is definitely trending up (exponentially) since Nov 2015.

This is a good proposal. You will need to take it to the BTC developer community to get any kind of traction.

The article states the opposite: "So much for Bitcoin shooting to the moon"

This is not true at all. If you want to use USDT (as an individual), you need to buy it in equivalent fiat or crypto currency. When you sell USDT, you get the equivalent fiat or crypto currency. It is not free. Bitfinex is a completely different issue.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:14:28
Well, then get to it, will you?
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:06:24
This is a useful piece of research. However, the title is ridiculous as it is based on two data points - hardly a "trend."
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:53:27
You might get a better response at  You will see there that Poloniex support is non-existent so it's not likely that your issue will be resolved. The recent acquisition by Circle is a glimmer of hope.

Boring (i.e. low volatility) is good in the investment world (unless of course you want to be day trading). It's been steadily increasing for the past 9 days so no complaints here.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:53:45
Sorry but that's just plain silly. People actually spend USD to buy USDT to buy BTC. Tether is simply a medium of exchange, not investment capital.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:38:28
When making any sort of a crypto chart, the price needs to be log scale. That's when you can see the trend. Linear charts are highly misleading.

I think there are already some other proposals in the works along the line of mBTC

Targeting institutional and high-value private clients
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:54:59
So the tether market might be unreal but that doesn't mean BTC or any other coin is created out of nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:25:08
Poloniex is not responding to support tickets, so if you are so certain that this will be resolved quickly, the only way that this will happen if you resolve it yourself.
