Thank you kind sir. It was a little confusing at first but I think I'm getting the hang of the whole thing. And now I know I'm good to go and able to spend and receive. Now this wallet is just one of many I could potentially own? There are other things I've seen like lightcoin I believe it's called. Are they the same or what?

That's even cooler

Thank you! I'm definitely understanding the whole thing now! I shall pass the tip forward. I think I will try to do a cash transfer somehow. Anyone suggest a easy, safe way to do it. The one through reddit whole set  up looks good. I wish I could use my bank though.

Ahh. So blockchain isn't my wallet? or is it?

I asked my brother and a good friend of mine that have some skill with drawing. I'm not sure they will but I figured it was worth a shot.

Awesome idea. That's a lot of money. You're a good person. I've just noticed it does indeed charge per transaction. Correct?

Where you refunded? they just posted something. log in

Now that really clears everything up. Thank you.

Damn. Sound awesome! I've just learned of bitcoin and the wallet available through the reddit bot. Now all I need to do is figure out a way to earn some coin. The whole idea of tipping people on here in so cool. It's like gold but better!
