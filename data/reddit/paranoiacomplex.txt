I agree that the point you're making is important, however you're acting like a child when you're informing them about it. Stop being confrontational and rude.








Calm your ass down dude

If you focus on the accounts that some lazy person made in a few moments before they try to convince people of an opinion, then you become more blind to the possibility that there are people who control many trustworthy accounts that can argue on behalf of an issue using personal stories and witty remarks.
In reality, you should be treating any comment with the same skepticism, regardless of their lack of karma or creation date

What? How corporately brainwashed are you? Do you own an apple t-shirt for every day of the week and did you glue to your tongue a shoe of someone working in Apple management? Stop acting like such a large corporation does ANYTHING based on any sort of ethical reasons.

It would be nice if there was some sort of tracker that kept tabs on businesses that accept bitcoins as payment. If I knew that there was a convenience store or supermarket by me that accepts it, then it would make my decision to invest in bitcoin a lot easier.
