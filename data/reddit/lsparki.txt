Can you link one of these pools? And where can I find password databases, hashed or unhashed? I have 100s of GPUs at disposal, so hashing power is no problem

Firstly, there are two ways to mine: ASIC and GPU (cpu mining is dead, we're not in 2012). ASICs consist of chips that are designed specifically for mining and are very efficient, with return of investment of ~4-5 months (for antminer S9). Some ASICs can mine bitcoin, but they are very loud at about 75db and stay very cool at 30 degrees. If you can isolate it, it's probably the best option. For ASIC mining you need to buy an ASIC (Antminer S9 is the best for mining bitcoin) and a PSU, it requires 6 (I think) 6-pin power connectors, bitmain(guys that make antminer) sells soldered PSUs, so you can plug it and start mining. They sell ASICs in batches and ship only after 2-3 months after you purchased it. After you get the ASIC, setup the pool(dunno how to do it for an ASIC, just google it). You'll also need ethernet Internet connection and that's it. 
Now gpu mining. You'll get your money back only in 8-10 months and they cannot mine bitcoin. But you can mine on Nicehash and get paid in BTC. It's very easy to setup, no pain with pools, miners not recognizing gpu, etc. List of stuff you need to buy: 
1. gpu, obviously
2. Motherboard (h81 pro BTC is probably the best one)
3. CPU (any Intel celeron is enough)
4. RAM (4 gb)
5. Risers if you don't have enough Pci-e x16 slots
6. PSU (100W * amount of GPUs + 200W for motherboard and cpu) * 2 = best wattage for your PSU

Technically you can use razer core or a cheaper alternative if your laptop has a thunderbolt port, but I don't know if it will reduce your hashrate. Just buy a cheap mobo, throw a cheap cpu, ram and a flash drive into it, add a very good PSU(500w for 1 1080 is enough) and you've got a rig! It's probably even cheaper than a good thunderbolt gpu connector. Btw 1080 is definitely not the best gpu for mining. If you want to mine specifically bitcoin, get an ASIC, GPU is useless for ASIC-mineable coins, and payback period for an ASIC is just 4-5 months. If you can't afford an ASIC, buy a gtx1080ti, it's very good at mining zcash or a vega56 with flashed vega64 bios for ethereum. If you want to know how much exactly will you mine, head over to cryptocompare.com or whattomine.com
