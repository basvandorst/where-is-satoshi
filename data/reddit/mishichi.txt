Your usual TA-based prediction says : IF BITCOIN GOES UP IT WILL GO UP EVEN MORE UNLESS IT GETS REJECTED AAND IF IT GOES DOWN IT WILL GO DOWN MORE UNTIL THE BOUNCE

Look up the volume on Bitmex and OkEx ... Ok, Bitmex's volume is essentially the perpetual swap but I wouldn't say the derivative market is "order of magnitude" smaller.

Don't misunderstand. I don't know your friend but I'm pretty sure he is only doing this as a part of a diversification process. He is already wealthy and simply allocated a very tiny amount of his investment portfolio into crypto. That doesn't mean he was right to buy at this price : that means it doesn't matter if he isn't. He doesn't care about losing 75% because he only bought just in case it goes X100 in case of some sort of economic crisis or another insane bubble run. The money he is really counting on comes from whatever activity already got him rich.

When it goes up : "Wish I could get a good entry"
When it finally dips : "Dunno man, what if it dips more ?"

I don't think it's Chardonnay, the bottle isn't the the typical Burgundy shape and the color seems to be too gold. I'd bet on a sweet wine.
