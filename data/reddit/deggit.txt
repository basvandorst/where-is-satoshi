Yeah my friend once showed me one of those roof jumping videos.
"Doesn't that look cool?" she asked.
"Because he survived," I answered.
These subreddits are full of the Parkour Fallacy. Some guy quintupled his money in 1 month by getting in on altcoin that was about to be shilled. Great job, you stuck the landing, upload yourself to YouTube. The people who missed the other rooftop are of course nowhere to be found.

um, autistic ancap/libertarians *started* bitcoin

article from 2011: ["Why the new bitcoin is a favorite of libertarian hipsters"](
your history is exactly wrong, bitcoin used to be *only* popular with libertarian communities *and then* spread to other communities &amp; the mainstream around 2012-2016

Compare to the velocity of a good old fiat dollar. It's been used so many times, yours probably still has cocaine on it. [This is not a joke](

So you don't use it as a medium of exchange, you don't use it to buy stuff, you don't even bother to have custody of it, you acknowledge most people who have it are technically incompetent to understand it, and you're telling me that it's worth $9000

Someone hands me a bitcoin, says it's cryptocurrency
MAAAAAN! This isn't money! This is a piece of code
SO I THREW IT ON THE GROUUUUUND

Are you saying that Bitpay never holds reserves of BTC, but the moment you pay them BTC they turn around and advertise them for sale into USD?
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:12:37
Bitcoin isn't a money until you can purchase goods and services directly with bitcoin.
On the day that you can walk into a store and pay bitcoins to the store owner and he'll take them and give you a product, on that day, bitcoin is a successful money.
The network of buyers and sellers that accept bitcoin directly constitutes the 'bitcoin economy.'
The **real bitcoin economy** is magnitudes smaller than advertised. The truth is that most bitcoin-accepting sellers are either selling something illegal, or they are themselves bitcoin speculators/investors and use their business as a way to accumulate BTC as a commodity.
The **false bitcoin economy** is all the merchants who say "We accept Bitcoin!" when what they really mean is "You just go ahead and give your BTC to Bitpay, and we'll take (Bitpay's) cold hard dollars please." This economy is unsustainable because Bitpay can only make a profit if BTC constantly appreciates against the dollar. Bitpay is a currency exchange speculator except one of the things they're speculating on isn't even widely used as a real currency.
Good luck buying a Lambo with BTC. You'll never do it. You can buy a Lambo with $, Euros, yen, but you'll never buy it with BTC because the Lambo dealer has no use for them.
Please understand that **I am for** BTC being used as a currency if you guys can make it happen. However posts about "Oh look, my BTC holdings can nearly afford a Lambo" just make you all look like idiots. Currently, BTC can only be used to buy dollars.

So even Bitpay doesn't want to hold BTC? *scratches head*
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:44:14
It's possible I misunderstand Bitpay's business model. But my understanding is that they take your BTC, and pay USD to the merchant.
Superficially this doesn't look different from any other currency exchange (such as if I started a currency exchange for USD:EUR).
At any point in time, Bitpay is holding large reserves of dollars and bitcoins. At any point, I am holding large reserves of dollars and euros. Looks identical right?
 The difference is that for me, whether my holdings are predominantly USD or predominantly EUR at any point, doesn't really matter. Either way I can use my money to buy goods. 
However, BTC cannot buy goods. Even most of Bitpay's own merchant clients do NOT WANT to be paid in BTC, they accept USD only.
Thus, the BTC part of Bitpay's holdings are long term useless. They cannot buy goods and services. So Bitpay needs to constantly be selling off the BTC they are collecting from customers, back into USD that can actually pay bills, employee salaries, etc.
If BTC appreciates vs the dollar, they do this at a profit (a VERY large profit, over the past year).
If BTC were to deflate vs the dollar they would do this at a loss and quickly go out of business.
That's my understanding....
If "BTC stabilizes against the dollar" then Bitpay could possibly have a business model just from charging fees. But wouldn't this devolve into Bitpay = Paypal 2.0? I mean in charging the same amount of fees, etc.

Welcome to Reddit, Peggy Noonan

So it's a measure of money velocity basically?
Isn't high money velocity (low bitcoin days) good if you want bitcoin to be a currency? But it seems like a lot of users here are fearing a "whale sell." Seems like they're thinking of BTC more as a commodity than currency....
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:34:55


This continues to avoid the real point... 
Questions about the dollar's stability, incarnation as a debt instrument, propensity to inflation, question of inherent value, etc. are irrelevant (although I agree with some of what you're saying)
the relevant issue is that dollars can buy goods and services, but bitcoins cannot. 
Even if Amazon accepted Bitpay tomorrow, this would not enlarge the true bitcoin economy one bit because you still can't use bitcoins to buy books (or any other Amazon product). You can only give bitcoins to a currency exchange operator who will give you dollars to buy books. That currency exchange operator **can only** do business as long as bitcoins will be worth even more dollars tomorrow.

Bitcoin already is fiat, it's not a commodity-backed currency.
But your story is a great illustration of the advantage of *government-instituted* fiat currencies. The government forces everyone to accept dollars as legal tender.


USD isn't part of the **Chinese** economy, certainly! except through FX. This is okay. CNY is the money of the Chinese economy and USD is the money of the American economy. Each of these economies is worth trillions of dollars in economic activity, and each money is backed by the government of its respective economy.
Bitcoin is the money of the 'bitcoin economy'. The 'bitcoin economy' doesn't have a market cap of $2b or anywhere near it. 
The number of merchants who actually accept bitcoin (not bitpay) and are selling legal products (not drugs) and accept BTC payments as a currency (not an investment in a commodity) is virtually nil. This is the true bitcoin economy. I doubt it has a value greater than several million dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:15:43


And every new Bitpay/Coinbase client is worth an article falsely stating that "X is now accepting Bitcoins!" not true. 
Find me a list of the companies brave enough to *actually accept Bitcoins in payment.* Gonna be a much smaller list. That list represents the real 'fundamentals' of Bitcoin.

For the record, I'm for the legalization of most illegal drugs, so I'm not saying "Bitcoin is for drugs! YEAYAAGRH!" in some kind of pejorative, Nancy Reagan way.
