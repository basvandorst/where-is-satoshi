The value of Bitcoin is a Bitcoin, backed by all the nations of Earth, which is backed by the largest economy in the entire universe.

Statement Regarding BTC Withdrawal Delays
Tokyo - JAPAN - February 07, 2014
Dear MtGox Customers,
In our efforts to resolve the issue being encountered by various bitcoin withdrawals, it was determined that the increase in the flow of withdrawal requests has hindered our efforts on a technical level. To understand the issue thoroughly, the system needs to be in a static state.
In order for our team to resolve the withdrawal issue it is necessary for a temporarily pause on all withdrawal requests to obtain a clear technical view of the current processes.
We apologize for the sudden short notice. All bitcoin withdrawal requests will be on pause, and the withdrawals in the system will be returned to your MtGox wallet and can be reinitiated once the issue is resolved. The trading platform will perform as usual for the needs of our customers.   
Our team will resolve this problem as soon as possible and will provide an update on Monday, February 10, 2014 (JST).  
We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused, and thank you for your kind support and considerations.  
The MtGox Team

How much was the purchase cost for the ATM ? I live in Wooster, Ohio and would not mind setting one up over here.
@_date: 2014-09-02 01:38:06
Looks like a weird knock off of a Angry Birds pig
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:14:58
Then it comes back after all that refreshing.....
@_date: 2014-05-06 00:13:47
Sounds good to me. I just need to know how to make that odd looking "u".
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:14:20
Still down for me. :(

Up vote for Mr. Bean.

Using a mash up of things. The Banks are always "we must exist" and "we are here to serve you", and must get rid of the Bitcoin threat to their world.
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:11:28
Ok, now I want to see them putting it down in the meeting within Rivendell. All marked in the captions as Bankers. Of course each banker is trying to find a way to destroy the Bitcoin, and finally a banker has had enough(Gimli) and tries to axe it. It then breaks into more BlockChain enabled Coins! 
\*Everyone in the meeting stares in wonder\*
\*It is highly divisible
\*It goes beyond two decimal places
\*Appling Gimli's law axe did nothing!
We shall take it and denounce it to the shadows(Mordor). No one must believe in Bitcoin's.
@_date: 2012-07-12 17:46:30
yeah. Sorry.
Just this has been old news in some circles.
@_date: 2012-02-24 14:08:01
Https: brings up the message.
Http: show no connection at all.

Uses App folder instead of Whole Dropbox access.
Needs Curl to work
@_date: 2012-02-24 16:26:52
Seems to be working now.
@_date: 2012-04-20 12:16:14
I love the BlockChain.Info/wallet. It works very well and they are not stopping with just a web based client too. Import and Export options so you are never tied to them for good. Backups too, even to DropBox.Com
@_date: 2012-07-12 17:34:00
Where have you been ?
@_date: 2012-01-06 15:27:29
Nope. This is something I was going to build...someday. It was aimed at Bitcoin AND server AND Gaming.
 If just Bitcoin, you can likely do without the dual CPU setup.
@_date: 2012-03-08 19:02:09
I am demanding it.
However I lack a steady bitcoin supply.
Otherwise, yeah, I would use it.
@_date: 2012-01-06 15:03:43
I'll send this to you as a starter setup to play with.
@_date: 2012-01-09 17:25:35
Wow. You need a nice UV case.
@_date: 2012-04-20 13:25:46
Google Chrome should be able to translate it.
@_date: 2012-01-06 17:28:53
It was the only one that popped up that was both water cooled and single slot spacing.
@_date: 2012-01-06 15:08:40
You can put in more than one/two/three cards on this setup.
Check the motherboard specs and case slots.
@_date: 2012-04-20 13:29:30
There is a English link in the top right. Click it and then search for bitcoins in the search box.
Found this: 
@_date: 2012-01-06 15:31:32
The Video card is a GeForce GTX 590.
This shows some mining compares: 
The motherboard: Classified SR-2 : 
Supports 7 PCI-E 2.0 slots. That can hold a lot of video cards.
@_date: 2012-06-19 18:48:22
So something just like Prosper.Com. For BitCoins instead.
Prosper.Com also has people "borrowing" money and not paying it back. So, those borrowers automatically goto a collection agency to get the funds back. Can't do that with BitCoins, unless you ALSO start a collection agency for this too. But then to be labeled a "collection agency", we would have to conform to the rules setup for it. 
 That could be a big problem..
@_date: 2012-10-21 17:01:39
Got the same message. Nothing was transfered.
@_date: 2012-03-28 12:40:39
Anyone able to get this to work if you have multi-auth enabled ?
@_date: 2012-08-01 18:45:58
 When a EMP from a nuke fries all the computers and magnetic media, all the bitcoins will be wiped out along with the currency of choice(If Bitcoins get adopted).
Until then, yes, we will be losing Bitcoins over time. There may even be a tipping point when too many are lost and people are still charging high amounts of BTC because of it's relation to other currencies like the US $. What happens then ?
@_date: 2012-05-09 12:57:46
Where ?
I have only found two on a tor wiki.
@_date: 2012-05-02 12:04:42
Https://blockchain.info shows something sometimes. Http:// shows nothing.
@_date: 2012-01-09 21:38:34
You are going to have to show that off too!
@_date: 2012-06-27 19:39:37
Yes please do.
Some of us need a grid page showing the payment processors on what bitcoin sites.

Nothing will save them. The network will be down for 15+ years.
In short, you will have other things to worry about. If this happens in winter....

You have not seen the Wal-mart parking lots have you.

Are the above posters from bitspend ? :)
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:26:17
I'm hoping to find out if the address I'm sending to is valid before I send my coins to different places then back to the moneypak address. If it isn't, I'm going to have to contact the website owner to change it to a different address for my moneypak account.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:27:33
of late, yeah.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:32:36
Is this true ? They get stuck ? My understanding was that with enough network capacity, it will get picked up.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:26:24
Governments should govern. Instead of control and dictate.
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:39:26
It was a new address. 
It is working now. A Mt.Gox hiccup.
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:33:43
A newly created address worked fine for a test amount: 8faee81fd9d56f4c4775e041237c1c25bbbf069f44300ee0591750c4abfe1dab

Well, this looks perfectly useful. Save me some trouble making my own.

Anyone know the smallest nuke that could be used ? The one used in Japan was in the kilo range. Ones made/used today are mega. Put one of those high in the sky for emp effect and it may do a full half of the planet.
Need to dig up some data....

Support @  is just stuck saying "Hello, we're going to find you a support agent to chat with...".
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:38:24
It is now working fine. Just had to wait just like  said.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:26:10
Revive ? I keep seeing new things pop up. Not disappearing.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:23:46
A emp or other power surge(lightning) can wipe your offline drive. Paper can be stored for a hundred years or more.
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:37:18
Good question.
I say, "Legal tyranny".
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:34:23
*sigh*. I hope it does. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2013-02-13 23:21:51
I bought 2 bitcoins two days ago. Sorry.
