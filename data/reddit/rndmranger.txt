I wanted to know what settings were most profitable for mining on my PC (yes, I still do that), so I charted out some data. Turns out it looks as easy as using the lowest power target; thought you guys might be interested.
Specifically, this is a Asus Strix 980, and a Asus Strix 1070Ti

And Bitcoin has an inherent value in...

I think you missed the emphasis on *inherent*. Gold has value because of its luster and unique physical properties. The USD has value because we say so. That's the difference.

Yes. This is exactly what makes something fiat.

It has no inherent value, as opposed to a commodity like gold. This is what makes a fiat currency.

Gold has properties that give it practical application for use, such as being just about the best electrical conductor available (because of its resistance to oxidising). 
I'm not saying that art doesn't have value, or that the USD doesn't have value, I'm just describing *inherent* properties/value as I understand it. 
If everyone decided gold was ugly, and no longer wanted it for jewelry, it still has value as an electrical component/raw material. Paintings and dollars raw material value is their ability to generate a little heat and light for a short time.
