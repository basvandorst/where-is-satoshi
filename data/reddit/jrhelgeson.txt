Anyone else read this as “You must stop development of this crypto until we can figure out how to get a cut, or at least a sizable campaign contribution.”

It’s “Living *a* good life” vs. “Living *the* good life”  — there’s a difference.  Know the difference.

How do you report the Crypto though? IRS themselves has said it’s considered property, like a gemstone or anything else of value that you can own, 
The problem is that there is no clear guidance provided on how to treat this stuff. I read news accounts of people being arrested and charged with running a money transmission business for selling their crypto.  So are they declaring crypto=money?
I work in infosec. I have sold many thousands of $$ to companies that have been hit by crypto malware. I got into bitcoin because I knew customers would need it and the ransom would need to be paid in 24-72 hours, and it takes 7 days to purchase on Coinbase.  I have no clue how to report this stuff, and there has been no guidance provided on how to do so.  Even if your tax advisor that knows how to spell BTC, there’s still no guidance on how to report a transaction as one involving crypto.

Thanks for the heads up. I just bailed.

Why did the price stabilize right after the most recent update? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:52:02
All they'd do is create a hard fork. The original BTC would not be taken down.

We are not a democracy. We are a republic.

A representative republic is far different than "mob rules" democracy. In fact, it limits the power of the mobs.

Well, people get the leaders that they deserve.

Did you miss the part where he said they were very well educated?  It's the 'educated' that vote for socialism.  Or shall I say indoctrinated.

There is nothing to compare bitcoin to. The closest is Gold. Bitcoin isn't a company that can go out of business or get sold off. It doesn't have a CEO that can say something stupid or get involved in some scandal.  It's not a stock. 
At the dawn of computing, airline flights were processed using punch cards.  To this very day, the air travel system runs on that ancient foundation.  Everything from flight confirmation numbers to routing of planes still hearkens back to the punch card days.  My point being that bitcoin may be slow, but it is very stable and damn near impossible to change. In fact, it's stable because of the near impossibility to change it.

The internet changed the world. It too was complex. Paradigm shifts don't wait for you to be ready. They happen.

Bitcoin is a bubble the same way the internet is just a fad. 
There were people in the 90's who really thought it would all blow over.  When the .com boom went bust they were jubilant at finally being right.  
It's only happened repeatedly throughout history; electricity, internal combustion engine, powered flight - those all had detractors who saw them as just fads, hobbies, novelties. They failed to realize the new paradigm had forever changed the world.
