Ignoring the title, this person does provide some interesting information - please watch the video before jumping to conclusions.

It's more the idea that, rich people sometimes give a lot to "seem" like they care. If a bussiness with vats resources donates to a very public charity, they'll usually do so in a way that benefits the charity, but also preserves their profits. No CEO or high-ranking person would willing give up a huge bonus for a charity.
In terms of the Bible, all offerings to God are valuable - if the person offering has their heart in the right place.
As with all things, hidden agendas ruin the sincerity of charitable acts. The Biblical parable was just a way of saying, she didn't have any hidden agenda - she only donated what she could.

You also make a very valid point. And regarding the wiser people, of course they have - whether they're wiser or "wiser" we'll never know.
There are loads of stories in the Bible like this that don't make 100% these days, and some seem downright stupid... My dad always tells me to take the Bible with a bit of (I forget the exact phrasing, so don't judge my dad lol) salt, as in, consider the time frame in which it was likely written and the education levels of the general target audience.
Personally I like to think that a lot of the stories that don't make sense have simply been "edited" down to the point of only carrying across the message, but accidentally leaving out the logic...
Thank you for your very decent reply :)
Edit: Decent meaning, you didn't try to start an argument or something. (English is not my first language)
