You're right, Bitcoin is not anonymous, but it is pseudonymous.
Think lurking on reddit, your username is your pseudonym, your activities can be been by the public, but no one knows that it's you. (of course except the NSA and CIA)
The more you interact using this pseudonym the more history you will generate, hence more data to be able to track you down in real life.
That's just an example. Hence the reason why you shouldn't re-use your addresses if you want to preserve your anonymity.

I think this is something that is deeply embedded to our **education system**. Whatever the authorities says, goes.
Even when we're doing our research for dissertation paper, everything that you write needs to be referred from books, statistics, journals, articles. We don't produce original opinions anymore, it kills the critical thinking part of our brain.
Hence, we tend to want authorities to tell us how to value things, because we have someone to blame if is doesn't come through. If they tell us something has value, i.e. US Dollar, then it has value right? the authorities are not going to lie to us right? Right?

1. buy bitcoins from localbitcoins.
2. withdraw bitcoins directly to your friends wallet.
Entire process takes 30 minutes tops yo.
But then again, localbitcoins is a centralized service as well. so fuck.
You already bought bitcoins some time ago, mostly through your dedicated DCA strategy, now you can just send it to your friend at 1 sat/byte, takes less than 24 hours to confirm.
Moral of the story, buy bitcoin regularly.

1971 + 27 = 1998
USD survived way past the avg lifespan of a fiat currency, let's see how long they can sustain this designed-to-fail debt based system.
Give it a 54 year lifespan, which is double the avg. 
1971 + 54 = 2025
The end is near, keep hodling.
PS: For those who as wondering why I take 1971 as the start of the timeline, because this : "The USD has been around for a long time but it has only been a fiat currency since 1971. Before that its value was tied to a certain amount of gold so it was actually backed by something." - u/HedgeTheRisk

It's within their rights to garnish your account to recover the payments that you owe, it is your fault after all for not paying off or dispute the fine in totality.
Letting a fine just sit there isn't really a good idea, especially if the court has awarded the state to claim the amount owed + interest, it can balloon up to a huge sum of money.

It's good to test it out just to be sure. I've had experiences whereby people lost their phone, only to find out that they couldn't restore their seed phrase on another device, reason being that they copied down the wrong phrase.

The  "don't cheat or you lose all your money" feature is good as a safeguard, but it also acts as a double edged sword as the network doesn't recognize this as a human error. I think this is a common occurrence and maybe the LN devs can put a safeguard towards this 'feature'. It's bound to repeat itself, eventually.

Absolutely right, MyCellium's fee structure is meant for the average user's transaction to be confirmed within the next block or two with high PROBABILITY. Not letting the user have a slim shot at getting the transaction confirmed within the next 6 blocks. 
OP was lucky to have the transaction confirmed that quickly considering his sat/kb fee.

This is probably a good warning if you are somewhat technical or well versed in this sort of thing. But for the average person, this will be a disaster.

you're right, absolutely fucking right. I agree with your statement.
But, I am an supporter of bitcoin as a payment system, but it requires a 2nd layer to assist in payments, which is the lightning network.
The lightning network, just like any network, will have a network effect when more people are using it. That is the beauty, we might see bitcoin with low fees in the near future. 
how soon? maybe a couple of years.

If you are not an avid saver and unable to save much from your paycheck. I'd suggest you pay off your debt and hodl the remaining bitcoins. 6% interest will double your debt in about 12 years if left unpaid. 
However if you are the frugal type, keep your coins and let it grow. Work hard and pay off that debt. You can pay it off within 2 years no problem, 48k is a little over 2k a month for 24 months.

One more thing, I'm not doubting bitcoin as a decentralized asset, it's just that those are some powerful people that you're dealing with, rich and smart as well. I'm all for lightning network! it's a risk that bitcoin will take, we'll see where this will take us.

"To remain listed long-term, the company’s value would have to remain above $35 million for at least 10 days."
If only they had an ICO, it'll definitely be worth more than that. There's no need to be listed on NASDAQ to be mainstream.

Unfortunately those companies that want to accept bitcoin fall into the trap of using BitPay as their payment processor.

Get your infos straight, it's been like this since forever. This is due to security issues, fair distribution to all ATM users and what not.
If you want to withdraw everything in **cash** you can still do so by visiting your bank during business hours.
Shit only gets real if banks limit your daily withdrawal to X amount when you walk in, not ATM machines.

If you don't HOLD it, you don't OWN it.
This old saying comes from precious metal owners.
Paper wallet is the safest type of storage after hardware wallet. But it's something that you generate yourself.
Save bitaddress.org and run it offline OR flip a coin 256 times (search that on youtube)

Is the Math correct here? Please do correct me if i'm wrong
Assume 32MB blocks every 10 minutes:
Hence, 32x144 = 4608 MB/day
365 days, 4608 x 365 = 1,681,920 MB or 1.68192 TeraBytes

Exactly, the entire world uses 21,776,088,770,300 kWh of electricity every year according to the link you provided. 
At the cheapest rate of $0.05 /kWh, it would be $1,088,804,400,000.00 (that's over $1 trillion) every year.
At the average rate of $0.10 /kWh, it would be  $2,177,608,900,000.00 (that's over $2 trillion) every year.
$4 billion a year is merely a drop in the ocean.

Soon there will be more decentralized escrow services with affordable fees for the average consumer. 
One of them would be PayFair, and no I'm not trying to get you to buy the coin, you don't need to buy the token to use the platform. This decentralized escrow platform will launch this April. Check out payfair.io it's currently in testnet stage.
Another would be FairX, built on top of the stellar network. Their mainnet is yet to launch, but I'm pretty sure it would be somewhere this year.
