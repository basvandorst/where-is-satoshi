Get ready to buy in the dip ��

This is so true, and true of more than money. Your brother lost a lot more than $50 million, in both money and life experiences.
I've had 2 close family members die of suicide in the last 2 years, and the worst part about it, after the funerals are done and the dust settles and we get through our survivor's guilt (or at least learn to recognize and live life in spite of it), is not knowing *why*. We want to have resolution and know why they chose to leave. In the case of my relatives, mental health problems were definitely the causes. I strongly believe that no person who is in their right mind can take their own life. People die of suicide, they don't commit it (at least not in their full minds or with their full capacity to make decisions). We may not always know the *why* in this life, but I believe we can see them again after we die and be given a clear view of their minds and their feelings and experiences.
Your brother died because his brain's life preserver malfunctioned. It's like his heart or his liver or his stomach failed, but it's harder for us to internalize because the problem was instead with the organ they used to express their souls and manifest their identities.
I hope you and your family can find peace and grow closer to each other and to your brother because of this tragedy. God bless you.

It would be less ambiguous to say $17k, or 1 mBTC. 1 Bitcoin ≠ $17...

I just did that today. I took my small profits from my month of holding to pay some unexpected bills, and I'll be back next month.

Nah, this sub is weird with or without the tolerance troll ��
It's great. I think people have to adopt a certain level of levity to handle the stress/excitement that comes with Bitcoin ownership.

Heck yeah I'm hodling. I bought at $7.1k. I haven't even hit 10x my investment yet ��

You mention buying stocks with Bitcoin in the video. Is there an exchange I can use to do that with a small amount ( &lt;0.01) of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:48:26
Seriously. And with absolutely no notice or roadmap. What are they doing?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:57:42
*a part
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:33:31
[Wikipedia (Wikimedia Foundation)]( is obviously something awesome that the whole world benefits from. I gave my $15 this year. I'm sure they could do a lot more with 1BTC ☺

Yes. The best time to buy is 6 years ago. The next best time is now.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:25:52
There we go. Finally an expert opinion ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:26
Psh this is *so* 2 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:08:30
I... What... You... You should choose your media better ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:23
You need dedicated hardware, or a share in a mining pool. You're looking at a significant money/time investment for either, so you'll want to do your due diligence and do your own research so you really know what you're getting into.
For a cryptocurrency you can mine in your average desktop computer, check out Ethereum. For consideration, I made about 0.05 ETH (worth ~$20 right now) by mining at night and during the workday for about 3 weeks. As always, do your research and know what you're getting into.
And if you find any other viable desktop coins, let me know :)

No the number of digits changed. That makes it a crash /s

Wow, you're a meany head. Go eat a Snickers.

How is that a Ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:34:17
Your post is just very confusing without context and reminds me of that sub.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:06:37
Because development time is much quicker if you can generify or even completely skip optimization.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:31:36
Oh, I see now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:56:34

r/SubredditSimulator ?
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:30:09
No, it's only for bots that use Markov chains to write posts emulating posts from specific other subreddits. Humans can't post.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:04:29
Dooble? Is that you?
