You can always just transfer USD into your USD wallet in coinbase (which is FDIC insured) and then buy BTC once the USD is in. This way a bitcoin purchase will be immediate.

The trezor comes sealed and in a box which can only be open by ripping it apart ��

Can’t comment on Ledger.
Personally I have a Trezor, it was easy to set up, the chrome
app works well and the support is really good. Had no issues with it thus far.

Just remember that each transfer costs a small fee. 
ELI5 - It’s like using your ATM card to withdraw (buy) dollars at a ATM and then moving the money it spit out into a wallet.

The purchase takes a while because your bank needs the time to process the withdrawal. The price of Bitcoin gets locked in when you buy it though. As far as storage, I use a hardware wallet called Trezor. Software wise I heard good things about Exodus. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:02:52
Though that USD to USD transfer will still take 5-7 days, like someone said the delay is on the banks end, but at least you don’t run the risk of your bitcoin being in limbo while the price fluctuates.

Anytime ��

If you get a Trezor or Ledger then no need for a new comp.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:42:26
Really depends how much you have, a hardware wallet is definitely a good investment as it gives you top tier security and it’s very easy to use compared to a paper wallet. A seed is a 24 word phase that will allow you to recover your Bitcoin in case the device is lost / stolen / breaks. Keep the seed on a piece of paper safely stored somewhere like a bank vault (safety deposit box).

Bitcoin is kinda like the original currency so when most people think of crypto they think Bitcoin. With its massive adoption rate it’s kinda the face of crypto. There are other more “scientific” reasons too but I think it’s kinda like what the Gameboy was to gaming.

buy (greens) sells (red) orders. From the chart it looks like there is a big amount of sell orders put up for 10k. Once bitcoin hits 10k those orders will execute.

I read the you need to upload the ID using their built in method using a webcam to photo the ID front and back.

If you “weed out all the posers”, who will be left to take it to 8,500? For the value to go up there has to be demand, if it drops to 3k it will signal to potential buyers that it’s not worth investing anymore. While you might believe in the idea behind Crypto a majority of other investors do not as for now Bitcoin is viewed more of as commodity and not an alternative to Fiat. Until governments start regulation and start to recognize Bitcoin, it’s just a hot commodity that’s in a bubble which can burst if Federal decides against it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:11:13
Oh so sounds like you’re good then. I would set the buyback price a little higher though. When the price jumps it will prob jump a little above 10k before it falls (if at all).
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:45:15
You can send Bitcoin directly to GDAX, sell it then withdraw to bank account. If you have a bank account linked to your coinbase it should be linked in GDAX too. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:09:58
I think it will dip and by a lot. 10k seems like a really round no. and i wouldn’t be surprised if there are a lot of sell orders set at 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:31:08
I think it’s safe to say that for most including me the answer would be savings account or stock market.

Honestly if you keep it a secret then you're setting yourself up for a cause to divorce. if you can keep 2mil a secret who knows what else you're keeping from her. On another note, sell enough to buy that house but keep it in a account. Take out a mortgage and use the money from said account to pay for it. Don't wait  30 years to pay it off tho. Pay the mortgage until your credit score gets to a nice place and if your state does not have prepayment penalty then pay off the house. You could also invest that money into something that will grow at a faster rate than your mortgage interest.
Or buy a Lambo, I'm not a financial advisor just a guy on Reddit.

You mean track bitcoin price or track your profit?
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:58:46
If you live in the US and you held it less than a year it will count as short term capital gain and simply get added to your yearly income. If you held it over a year then its considered long term capital gain and its taxed from 0 - 20% depending on your income tax bracket.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:40:56
Interesting question, I wanna say yes. I feel like a lot of people want to see 10k. Buyers and holders. Though i’d say it will have a hard time passing 10k for a
while. Might hit 10k then fall a bit once the sell
orders execute. Just my 10 cents.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:35:47
Just to clarify, “Instead of putting left over salary in savings account or the stock market it went into Bitcoin”

Use GDAX (part of coinbase), sell it then move the funds to a connected bank account. Open a coinbase account and send the money from the gaming site to the wallet on either coinbase or GDAX.
Or........just move it and keep the bitcoin lol and let it ride.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:16:24
You can follow Coinbase (the most popular US exchange) by either downloading the coinbase app which will allow you to see the current price or going to gdax.com and saving the site to your home screen which will make it a web app.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:07:37
I’d love if it stabilizes just slightly above 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:23:47
For now Bitcoin is a commodity and it will stay that way until there is some federal recognition and calm in volatility. As for now bitcoin is a good but unpredictable investment against Fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:30:18
Nah no worries. gdax.com, it’s another service run by coinbase. Gdax is more of a exchange where you get more flexibility when selling at lower fees. 
If you have a coinbase account you automatically have a GDAX account.

Oh I use an app called Delta. It allows me to input my BTC purchases and then it tells me how much % i’m up for each and the total profit from all purchases combined.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:00:52
Don’t forget that now you have to pay capital gains tax on your profit even if you re-invest that profit. Depending on how long you had it it can either be your tax bracket or 0-20%.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:58:50
Unfortunately i’m not sure as I have not sold bitcoin (prefer to buy and hold) but I know if you did it through coinbase the current fee is like $5 to sell $300 worth. GDAX should be much less. 
I recommend just reading into it a bit more but first move should be to move the Bitcoin you have right to
either GDAX or Coinbase. Once they are on either one, you can move them between coinbase and gdax without fees.

Just gotta read into WHY it's falling and whether or not those reasons could indicate a future rise. China put a halt of exchanges, if this is temp then prices will rise again.
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:03:19
Depends what type of sign in, some services like Mint use login data to access your transaction records. Login info isn't enough to steal money from an account.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:05:27
If it's anything like the USD wallet in coinbase then its FDIC insured so nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:42:58
This, If China does heavily regulate it I fear other countries will soon follow.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:29:50
Please don't do this, Bitcoin is and always will be quite volatile. Only invest money you are ok
with loosing.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:15:37
My fear is that with China banning, other countries will follow :/ 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:21:28
lol, Literally just read that as your comment came through. That's good news!
