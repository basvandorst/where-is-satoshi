If smart contracts on Counterparty become popular, do you foresee a problem with all nodes having to run and verify all smart contracts? If so, do you have any plans to scale the smart contracts system in the future to handle a large number of contracts?

It was serious in the sense that we asked people to participate and we continue to put a lot of effort into running the program.
But, yes, we have had fun along the way for sure.

Doing it all by hand didn't scale.  So we made the decision to build the tools.  In our estimation, the best way to build the tools (a multi-year process) was to form a company to fund it.
In a perfect world, all the tools would have already existed before we started LTBcoin.  But then we wouldn't have been able to learn what tools we needed.  So it was a chicken-and-egg problem.
Tokenly was built specifically to solve the problems we ran into while running the LTBcoin rewards program.

It's not a counterparty send after all.  I was using a very lax parser.
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:35:15
It's an invalid counterparty send.
[update] No its not.
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:32:11
The data encoded in the OP_RETURN is the following (invalid) Counterparty send:
    asset: A9972123589574319505 
    quantity: 72785929766.0235
This send is not valid because the OP_RETURN should have come after the recipient and instead it was the first output.
[update] This is not an attempted counterparty send at all.
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:34:44
Nope.  It's an invalid counterparty send transaction.
[Update] No its not. Red herring.

Disclaimer: I'm a volunteer at the LTB network and a co-founder of Tokenly.  Views expressed here are (obviously) my own.
LTBcoin was and is an experiment at its core.
The experiment is all about bootstrapping.  How do you take a willing but unfunded volunteer community and turn that into a self-sustaining profitable eco-system?
You could 1) go the traditional route and take venture capital funding.  But then you are obligated to your investors who want to see astronomical growth in a short time.
Or you could 2) follow a crowdfunding model where you presell a specific product.  But in this case, the product did not exist yet.
Or, you could 3) try something new.  
We chose to do number 3.  By distributing a currency we gave people a stake in the future of the LTB network.  The effort that people put in during the bootstrapping days gives them tokens that may have utility in the future as the network continues to grow.
Here is a micro-faq:
Was it a success?  LTBcoin is distributed over a 5 year timetable.  We have recently passed year 1.  This project/experiment is still continuing.  We founded Tokenly because we needed additional tools to properly carry out this experiment.  But developing these tools takes a non-trivial amount of time.  A goal was to learn, explore and grow together as a community.  In that sense, it has already been a success.   While we have already learned much, in my opinion the experiment is just beginning so it is too early to tell.
Did this work out perfectly?  No.  But we have learned and continue to learn along the way.
What is Tokenly?  Tokenly is a startup built to solve the problems we ran into when launching LTBcoin.  We found we needed a lot of software.  And that takes a lot of time to build.  We also thinkg that other people can benefit from these same tools.  So we started Tokenly.
Is there more coming?  Yes.  The network of podcasts continues to grow.  Tokenly is actively building new tools to further this community bootstrapping model.  We are just begnning year 2 of a 5 year journey.
