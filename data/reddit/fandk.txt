I guess you are talking about a certificate of some sorts. That means that you through your certificate own bitcoin indirectly - and you put your trust on the people issuing the certificate. On the top of my head are some pros and cons of owning by certificate:
* arguably more convenient if you already own an account of some sort on that exchange.
* you dont have to worry about security etc.
* you put your trust that someone else handles the security of the coins for you
* you can only trade on market open hours
* the issuer probably has a percentage fee on the certificate

Probably since there are a lot of legacy users here that are used to purchase and own them that way. Or that they want to be actual owners of bitcoin, as in being able to use them directly in transactions (which you obviously cant do with a certificate).
Also I guess some people dont trust a company to store their wealth for them. What happens if the issuer of the certificates gets hacked on their bitcoin, or go bankrupt for other reasons?

Well I believe that lots of people are actually using that to invest. Especially those that are new to bitcoin and only in it to make $$$

If we leave possible bitcoin crash aside for a moment - this was a really poor article. First half is awkwardly edgy against "smartphone millenials" for no reason whatsoever then followed by a paragraph saying:
" Looking at the chart is telling us Bitcoin will crash"
Hmm. Okay. Cool analysis bro

Index fund bubble? What do you mean? Since you dont even mention a specific market do you believe the stock market as a whole will crash and burn? Because that is what you are implying with your comment.
