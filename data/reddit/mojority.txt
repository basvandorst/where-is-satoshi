Whales are feasting on Crypto Krill this leg down.  I am thinking final low $4.5K by mid-October....But then, as I understand it, 80% of Crypto is held by Whales/Hedge funds.  So it is move over and let the big whales eat until they decide the time/math is right for the next Bull Run.

In any case, even with ETF approval, might a lot of those ETF investors short BTC?  I understand the broker companies make $'s on all trades, but I am thinking maybe a lot of the guidance from those funds may be to short BTC?  Those companies will be looking to make sure their accredited investor $'s don't end up as Crypto Krill.

IMHO, I think you are spot on with your assessment.  The only unknown is how the potential late September EFT approval may impact the current glide path to $4K.  EFT approval could be the Adrenalin injection to change the trajectory to Bull and recovery mode.  I think that's the tricky part to factor in.

Lot's of Crypto Krill out there.  Bottom feeders in the lower depths.

Such a waste in the unfortunate event Hodlers do not have a plan in place to will them to surviving family.  I have read recently of a DGPT coin.  Yes, we love privacy. But the concept seems like an unmet need for many.  I will have to research this coin.  More on Reddit page.

In theory, the Bitcoin Network will adjust the level of difficulty in mining blocks to keep miners solvent and incentivized.  Still, I am not sure how the math 'trickles down' to smaller players vs. the hash rate mills.  The level of difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks.  And based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block every10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took longer than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced. If they took less than two weeks, the difficulty is increased. The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find.

Agreed.  Uptick right on schedule as expected by many.
