Do you believe in Bitcoin? Ask your self, don't get any info from other, do your own research, if you can believe it, why not to invest, support it, if you don't believe it and scare for a 51%attack just leave it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:55:54
That will be nice. Haha.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:35:09
Don't trust anyone!!!
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:58:49
Hodl, believe, don't trust any sh!t news, get your self a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:17:14
Cryptocurrency is get trust by public, and a giant company share have a BOSS. Once BOSS run, the share you buy with million dollar will be 0. But trusted cryptocurrency (except ICO) they are have no boss and limited coin, so the value will increase with more ppl invest, unlikely the unlimited printing paper money.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:12:29
If you plan to hodl a long time, you can buy on any price. Buy keep in a cold storage or paper wallet than leave it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:12:15

@_date: 2017-11-20 10:23:21

@_date: 2017-10-23 12:11:35
You can generate the bitcoin address with private key at bitaddress.org n keep it offline but u need to confirm your computer have no any malware or other  virus or you also can download a software from github to generate the bitcoin address with offline ( you can just disconnect the wifi or your router) if you use online generate, make sure clean your history after generate and not to keep your private key at any device or computer that online, most ppl copy or print on a paper, so that we calling it as a paper wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-27 04:28:05
All online Wallet are not safe, u better get a hardware wallet or a paper wallet. And keep your private code.
