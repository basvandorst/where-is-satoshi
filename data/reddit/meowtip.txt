Well this post is getting brigaded by so the sorting makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:54:28
Not strong enough... get 75% of the exchanges and nodes, then you can probably claim to be "Bitcoin." However the chances of that happening are near zero.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:44:35
Holy shit you have that backwards. It isn't Core's job, it's the community's job. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:01:00
If the hardfork isn't contentious, then no. Otherwise, maybe. It depends on what the economic majority decides.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:30:38
It's a shame that the planned capacity increase is being actively blocked by a certain altcoin promoter, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:28:28
...while destroying Bitcoin's network stability as it hardforks constantly into chains with different blocksize limits causing people to lose money in chain reorgs. What a wonderful idea!
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:18:59
The SEC just clearly outlined why no cryptocurrency will get an ETF in the near or medium term. The nature of cryptocurrency is that unregulated exchanges dominate marketplace, and the SEC doesn't like that. It'll take years for Bitcoin's regulated exchanges to dominate the space. Maybe then the SEC will take another look.

"Swiss bank account in your pocket" is such an awesome description of Bitcoin. [Thanks Obama!](
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:39:26
Why? That's pants-on-head retarded.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:04:02
Probably none because they don't actually run bu nodes, they just signal for it using core.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:32:53
Even if 75% of the hashing power is spent on a chain that is considered invalid by 90% of the nodes? Come on, you're not thinking this through. If Coinbase's Core node doesn't like your chain, then hash power doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:08:35
Since Bitcoin is overwhelmingly composed of Core nodes and always has been, you are dead wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:06:19
He is also now a huge altcoin investor so his interests are no longer necessarily aligned with what's best for Bitcoin. He has completely lost any goodwill he had left.
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:38:49
No, because Cryptsy is a minor exchange for altcoins. It's irrelevant as far as the whole trading ecosystem goes.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:00:44
Nobody said "we need the ETF." It was always seen as a rocket boost, but it isn't necessary.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:35:51
A lot of people lost Ether, yes, mostly due to replay attacks. It was messy.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:42:11
Now this is a strange bot. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:31:27
And naivety.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:45:27
Such ridiculous logic isn't it? 
"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded." 
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:29:20
Sure! I think people would be highly motivated to defend against such an attack and there would be a surprisingly strong response by the community to install a client with a new POW. There's nothing like an attack to bring everyone together. It doesn't matter if we revert to GPU mining since I'm sure we would get the vast majority of GPU miners in an instant.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:08:24
I can't believe that free-market lovers like Erik Voorhees and Roger Ver have no problem with Jihan Wu, a single enormous miner, controlling the block size along with a few of his fellow big miners.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:52:16
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:59:36
The economic majority.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:05:32
Yep but it never actually sold Magic: The Gathering cards.
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:59:29
Yep Jihan Wu said "Fuck your mother if you want fuck"
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:37:09
The chain with the highest amount of PoW is definitive, but the chains in question have to go by the same consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:45:04
Yes I believe so. Money networks have particularly strong network effects, much stronger than your standard internet social network. Bitcoin's network effect is unbeatable at this point. It also has a huge advantage in terms of public awareness. Bitcoin gets mentioned in the financial news all the time, and it's even been discussed dozens of times in TV shows and movies. Basically Bitcoin is the standard bearer for cryptocurrency. 
That doesn't mean that it is 100% safe from competition, but people have been warning that other cryptocurrencies would be defeating Bitcoin for the last 8 years, and it just doesn't happen. 
I think that fees would have to be much, much higher for people to move *en masse* to another cryptocurrency, and even then it would be a case of "nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded."
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:05:14
But it was still a bullshit violation of the community promise, which was that you could run contracts that wouldn't be tampered with. "Code that can't care." "Contracts that can't stop."
The DAO bailout put the lie to those promises.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:20:21
You're dead wrong. The price has been rising steadily since the middle of last year when there was no talk of the ETF (or it was basically mostly ignored by everyone).
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:26:03
People have been using this form of mockery for every setback Bitcoin has suffered since the price was $0.50. And now the price is $1170 which was supposed to be impossible.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:01:35
He set it himself as a consensus rule! 
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:43:23
But SegWit can be activate risk-free and provides some immediate relief. It's strange that anyone would not want it just because further capacity increases will be required.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:28:53
Why do you think that they're automatically ignorant of economics? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:19:08
Miners are necessary to order transactions into blocks and to prevent double spending. Beyond that they aren't the masters of the system, that's just a strange and incorrect narrative by some woefully misinformed Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:47:55
Bitcoin has only forked once before, and the forked chain was abandoned. We're still on the original chain.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:34:20
It won't last long, but it will provide immediate relief. It's ready to go right now and the miners just have to activate it by signaling for it.
Unfortunately the biggest miner isn't actually interested in capacity increases so he decided instead to block it.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:31:13
PERL is awesome!
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:02:31
Only if it's contentious. Otherwise an ETF should just resolve to follow the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:24:38
Why would that surprise you? With this many subscribers, altcoins promoters would love to use this forum to advertise their own products. But this is a subreddit for the discussion of Bitcoin, not altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:02:10
Reddit isn't Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:15:22
Yeah... maybe 3+ years from now, at minimum.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:57:06
No, because "emergent consensus" will destroy the network. BU is a bad idea and they should feel bad about it.
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:14:04
I'm guessing that you're the "c-level exec" that he's referring to?
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:00:33
I have to say, I was on the side of a block increase. But the absolutely irrational anger and downvoting displayed by the pro XT people lately has given me pause. The arguments for taking it slow aren't as crazy as they sound once you actually look into them. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:33:10
What political errors have they made? 
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:08:55












Sounds like a reasonable concern. This is what made you write an inflammatory post?
@_date: 2015-08-20 07:20:29
I see this complaint often, which is understandable given the confusion and disinformation spread around here recently, and that is of course one of the many reasons why complex technical issues shouldn't be decided in the court of public opinion.  Here's a good explanation from Adam Back:








@_date: 2015-08-20 07:03:14
It also makes small miners less competitive because it is harder to compete with the big boys who have access to the best bandwidth and private block distribution networks.
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:15:15
Because a contentious one will.
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:20:50
BU has a small crew of unaccomplished nobodies. Compare that with the cypherpunks behind Core. And guys like Bram Cohen, creator of BitTorrent! These are heavy hitters. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:13:06
Problem is that the people controlling BU are untrustworthy. I'll never run that software. Giving them control of Bitcoin will kill it, the same way the Ethereum foundation is killing ETH, through bad and rash decision making.
