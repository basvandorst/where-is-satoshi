I still feel Doge is a great "entry level" introduction to cryptocurrency, with a smaller (and nicer) learning curve, so I think it has it's place alongside bitcoin.

The notion that tangible appreciation of content is a positive should be accepted. The amount given is less important than the act itself. It truly could promote a better internet experience for all.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:19:53
Just some free advice, so it's worth what you paid for it, but chasing ups and downs has lost many a man his holdings. If you support both currencies, you'll statistically be much better off holding them both. Trying to hit a peak in one to buy the other later can just as easily have you end up with half of what you started with. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:17:34
Because I believed in the cause, and felt that it held up under scrutiny. I was happy to help, and wish I could see the possible impact. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:13:17
What if I've *had* a Brazilian? :P
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:59:06
I think the ability to show support in a tangible way is a key development going forward. Good luck!

It will go over and under, but at 4 PM EST, I'm sensing $418 for some reason.
If I'm correct, I'll guess the lottery numbers next!
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:16:18
Correct. Like a faucet, it would have a fund the members could donate into, and then the sub would reward posts with upvote thresholds automatically at set times.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:12:17
Like a hammer to the back of the head!
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:18:17
So, are you going to edit the title to show the winner?
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:59:47
This message cannot be spread enough!
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:09:11
That's just wrong! You can never tip too much! Acceptance for all!
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:06:20
It's not the amount, I feel, but the intention behind it. Just acknowledging content in some tangible way makes the internet a more conductive environment for positive change. 
Upvotes are free, and they provide benefit to a community. Actual tangible currency, even in negligible amounts, only does that in a greater sense.
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:18:38
I figure if people fund their own sub's "faucet" they can make the reward for content they all appreciate however they want it to work. As big or as small as they wish, for what fits their needs. It would really allow a community to forge their own style of content based on what they want in a tangible way.
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:21:16
For the major subs, you're exactly right.
But for the small community subs... the ones with a few hundred members that most people don't know about, and that are built around specific community needs (such as Guild subs, or class/city subs), the ability to implement this into those heavily moderated and little used (by outside members) communities would be of great benefit.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:22:01
Those who feel the tipping is diluting the coin are failing to see the great interest and appeal it is bringing to this sub. Acceptance happens with small steps, and this is definitely one the community should embrace (but far from the only one).
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:15:29
Submitted. Hardly took a minute! Hope you share the results.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:08:12
The initial peak in activity was a bit of a fad, but the idea is still strong. It's just being pushed as a way to get new people interested and reward content, now that it seems integrated.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:25:54
I doubt early adopters will keep their entire stake as the price rises. Increasing value will see them sell off what they did invest and keep the rest for later return. In essence, rising price will likely spread out the coins more, not less.
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:09:23
Reddit Gold pays Reddit for the use of the site. Changetip is a way to "pay" the generator of content. Both are useful for a better internet, but serve different purposes.
Now, if you want to make it so that upvotes generate changetips at certain levels from donated funds like a faucet, I'm totally on board there!
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:17:50
Strangely enough, [I just posted this.](
Something in there that might spark an idea?
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:48:15
Thanks for the generosity to help people get started!
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:45:06
Any post, once it reaches a set limit initially. But, say, the highest post (not previously winning, or posted within, say, 24 hours) at a set time (every day @ 5 pm, every Sat, night) could work too.
It's a brainstorming wishlist, not a fully-fleshed out idea, so I'm seeing lots of ways this could work. Essentially anything that helps a community fund and reward its own faucet to promote content.
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:57:31
Congrats on the Grand Opening! Best of luck to you and yours!
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:07:30
Why not diversify? Both have their purpose and place in the crypto community, I think. Silver and Gold, to me.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:28:59
Have you heard? Tipping is back in style too! :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:06:40
Seems to be a lot of that going around. And here I was hoping that tipping would promote a better community and greater content. Still hoping it helps raise the level of discourse on the internet, like it has the potential to do.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:03:55
Having a currency that allows for an entry-level user to get their feet wet promotes further crypto use, so Doge is a large part of the puzzle, in my eyes, for acceptance. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:17:15
It is definitely the point of tipping in my eyes.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:00:38
Anything that promotes adoption and gets interest and impressions is a good thing!
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:03:55
What kind of things were you thinking?
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:27:55
This is exactly why I think tipping can be an integral part of mainstream acceptance and exposure. I hope the current trend continues and spreads.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:18:38
If I had to pay someone every time I was wrong...

The V Foundation, because it gives 100% directly to research, is a great organization if you want to see your full donation used for its intended purpose of cancer research. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 11:59:54
Same every time, but is it an IP anyone else has used, and is it to a country they might have issue with? VPN's are especially volatile for getting flagged after someone else uses it. That is the issue for some people, who have privacy settings, or even redirectors for things like Netflix set up.
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:42:42
Amazing looking site! I love the design. Wish I were the type that could give it a try, but my brains are already mush from raising 2 kids. Will gladly pass it along to some friends more inclined to offer potential answers! Good luck!
@_date: 2015-01-23 09:42:42
I have heard of similar locks, but usually due to the location of the account holder and rules related to what they are allowed to handle. Was your IP your own, or one that might have been used by another (say, from a VPN)? In those cases, customer service was slow in getting back, as they had to be escalated in the service tree due to regulations. In cases I know where an IP flag gave a false positive, it was resolved (though not as fast as they hoped). You'll just need to provide proof of residence.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:19:07
How many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
None, that's a hardware problem.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:55:50
VPN networks share their IP range with other users. Someone could have logged into Cryptsy with the same IP your VPN gave you from a country deemed against regulations, and it would cause that flag to transfer to you as well. You should relate that to Cryptsy, with proof of your location, in your service request.

Most sites and blogs run off of advertising. I'd much rather incentivize content I enjoy than have them scrape by on ads. Not only would they keep more, but they would be able to devote more time to the content. It makes a better internet! Like buying the tshirt with logo of a site you like, except they don't have to produce and mail the tangible good, and keep everything I wanted them to get.
Tipping on the internet is what could save it from the blog-spam for ad revenue it has become.

With their connection to Sports and the media outlets attached, getting the V Foundation for Cancer Research (100% of donations go to research) to accept Bitcoin would benefit both them and us.
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:11:31
Thanks for doing this!
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:54:59
Made my first Bitcoin charity donation. Hope it inspires others to accept crypto!
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:30:15
I keep contacting The V Foundation to try to get them to accept bitcoin. Since 100% goes to research, it's a great cause to contribute to, without worry of your donation not getting proper use.
