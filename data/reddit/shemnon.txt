SIGHASH_SINGLE betrays user privacy.  It ties that specific input to a specific output.  You would never see this in a proper coin join.
Perhaps the BIP can be updated with a "don't do that" section, rather than making exceptions for specific positions in the output.
"If any input script uses SIGHASH_SINGLE then deterministic ordering should not be applied.  Generally speaking SIGHASH_SINGLE should not be used when privacy or anonymity is desired.  Individuals receiving SIGHASH_SINGLE transactions should relay those coins to another address prior to use in any BIP-LI01 compliant transaction."

Everyone needs to do it properly because it only takes one loose thread on a sweater to unravel the whole thing.

If you are analyzing a CoinJoin in a vacuum, yes.  But any analysis in a vacuum is always fundameltally flawed.


In a vacuum, yes.  But you will notice that two of them are currently unspent and some of them went into other coin joins.  But that's not the best part.  If you are running the analysis "backwards" trying to identify where a payment came from, you will know which of the .39... entries are relevant.  None of the inputs share values.


You put too much trust in what people do with their money before and after they tumble it.  The way you have to treat tumbled coins to preserve such anonymity ruins the fungability. Perfectly tumbled coins may be untraceable, but they then are basically useless because of the way you have to treat them. 


That's my main point.  You may not crack many cases with blockchain data alone.  But when combined with off-chain data a theory that was just probable cause for a search warrant can become beyond a reasonable doubt real quick.










They didn't recover the BTC, they recovered the assets purchased with the BTC.  Like any financial crime it would work like a bankruptcy: they would liquidate the assets and repay the claimants.  But if your claim was that your escrow for a LSD sale was stolen, you're not going to get relief from the courts, in fact quite the opposite.

There are emergent phenomena such as Peel chain and input clustering that going through the effort to mask make the BTC non-fungible.


It's not quite impossible, just not casually decyperable.  Most CoinJoins are just a very large Sudoku problem.  And even when done right they can be defeated.

While there is output matching, there isn't enough input matching.  The easiest way to pick apart a join is to start from the end coins and work backwards.  (easiest isn kind of a misnomer, perhaps the term computationally feasible is better).
But since most mixers don't have a set of all possible input coin sizes in their inventory to add to a mix to add privacy not much can be done unless the main joiners standardize on a set of input coin sizes that everyone is w/in a small percentage of of when they mix.
That's why a single actor alone cannot fix it, it needs to be a protocol rule (like dark coin does) or a practice of the mixing cartels.
That, and they (or any mixer for any of the mixes you participate in) cannot be under legal subpoena to log and share their mixings.  There's the real problem.

Coinjoin sudoku shows the brokenness of the inputs and output sizes.  Basically if you are the only whale or only small guy in a transaction of whales or small guys correlation attacks are sure to work.
DarkCoin (an alt coin, not a bitcoin service) takes one of the better approaches i've seen to this.  Only certain amounts of coin can be mixed, something like 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0, and 1000.0, same with the outputs.  Basically it's the same as everyone throwing their stripper dollars in a basket, mixing it up, and then distributing the results.  I think they also have some rules about a minimum number of like coins.
So if there are three dollars in and three dollars out then the number of valid combinations is 6, Whereas with mixed values the number of solutions is often one.  This ruins the correlation.
Now consider an input of three tens, and an output of thirty ones.  Correlations from that transaction alone are all but impossible to do.  It's not until the recipients then spend those dollars that output correlation can be attempted, and possibly then full transactional correlation.  But that adds time to the mix and requires a spend of the output.
In short, SharedCoin is broken in ways that it is impossible for blockchain.info alone to fix.

There is no evidence, just a narrative structure that reinforces your preconceived notions that Mark is stealing your bitcoin.  The consolidation occurs several steps before the cold wallet configurations, with many more input sources, none of which have any connection to MtGox.  MtGox can be proven for 4K of this 267K coins you are counting, for about 2.5% of the sources.
Here are some more narratives:  The Winkelvii bough those coins along with a few others and are keeping them on BTC-e.  These tips were used to buy some rare model trains for Dorian's collection.  Perhaps Mark had to pay off the neighborhood bully who took his cat hostage.  Or maybe, just maybe, a large trader got tired of MtGox and their americash transfer problems, and took their holdings over to BTC-e.  Legitimately.  Perhaps their legit withdraw was the straw that broke the back of the MtGox bank run.  
There are no pieces of evidence to prove or disprove any of these narratives.

Storing the bit coin in smaller (5K) wallets is actually a sound cold storage approach, not a nefarious theft method.

He knows exactly where they are he just doesn't know what the private keys are, since it is almost certainly an automated system.  One fear is that the keys were destroyed.

With his deposit info we could get a transaction into Gox's hot wallet, and if we can match it up to the 2014 leak we could use that as a wedge to start picking apart more of the hot wallet.

For example, on the 1FBiC -&gt; 1B4AW step there were two other inputs and one other output you are ignoring.  That other output make a larger pile.  And the chain you are following goes from nearly 10K to over 45k, so 35k come form non proven sources.

Not enough information.  What was your deposit?  Amount/date/time?  Deposit address and TXID would be nice.
Likely your coin went into their cash register, and then when the next customer came and was owed cash out of the register they handed out the bills you just handed them.  Gox still owes you the BTC you deposited, but the specific deposit you gave them was paid out, in what is in all likelihood a letigimate withdraw.
But without your source deposit information this is all conjecture.

Basically all their transactions are first signed by them, and then signed by BitGo.  When BitGo is sent a transaction, they look at a list of rules they have, and if the transaction meets the rules it is signed and propagated. (Rules such as no more than so many BTC sent in an hour/day/week, never to certain addresses, only if the description field has 'please' and 'thank you', etc.)
Think of of it as a check with two signers.  One is the department head who makes the real decisions.  The other signature is the comptroller who makes sure the paperwork is in order, but makes no decisions.  Except BitGo is way faster than your finance department.

Laundering through fees is a possibility, but for an especially large TX like this one there is the risk that a dishonest miner might see the large TX, not accept the block, add it to their memory pool, and try and win an orphan race.
It's not very likely now but if one of those dishonest miners represented 10% to 33% of the hashing power then this becomes a real risk.  If they controlled 51% of the hashing power we would see our first real 51% attack.
It's unlikely now IMHO because the net gain would be for less than the price of an PS4 or an XBox, but if coins ever hit 10K or 10MM it's not out of the question.

That Slovenian article has the most details I've seen yet.  Particularly the part about the theft going down while the founder was on the plane to CES.
Was it negligence?  I don't think so.  If it was they would have lost all their cold storage and all of their hot wallet, rather then most of the hot wallet, which they saved some of it when they fully realized what had happened.
Based on this article and many others I've read and research I've done it is my opinion that they lost the private keys to the customers inbound addresses, likely because of a loss of the root HD key for that batch of wallets (which also explains why they were able to get at the change address).  
So they were no more negligent  than Target or Home Depot or Sony or any of the other mainstream realtors who lost all those credit card numbers.  Companies need to be 100% right on every attack, and a hacker only needs to be good or get lucky once.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:45:36
Clever "attack" sends from a 0.001 wallet, then sends negative billions to one wallet and billions to another, so it balances out.  But the error checking on nodes prevents negative outputs, so this never gets mined (or quickly orphaned if it does).  BlockChain is just not culling it themselves, or throwing it into a relayed but invalid pile.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:44:22
What I like most about this one is that there are 5 outputs with the same amount, 0.5BTC.  If those are the intended payments then those will be impossible to assign with probability &gt; 0.2 based on this transaction alone.
Now those change addresses on the other hand...  Make sure they don't rejoin with any of the source or target wallets, or all bets are off.  Same goes with the 0.5 outputs.
And if you are all paying 0.5 to the same entity... then it really doesn't matter.

It was meant as an overstatement and a jab at Target, Home Depot, et. al.  All of these vendors were PCI compliant, which is the level of security required to process credit cards and have insurance pay for your negligent acts as though they were not at fault.  And yet each one was totally pwned.
So while insurance will pay for the mistakes of Target et.al. (whose mistakes and negligance were worse) likely BitStamp couldn't find an insurance carrier to cover stuff like this and will just have to take the hit in profits.

Look up what a poisson distribution is.  The peak is at 10 minutes, but literally any amount of time (greater than zero) between blocks is possible with the right probability.
So the next time there is a 20 to 30 minute block we can then observe the number of people that understand the math, and then the number of people that are speculating that someone just took a petahash of hashers offline.

Another kink is they will likely want the idea to show merit in the long run.  So my bet is in 10-20 years it will go to David Chaum and Adam Back at the same time.  Chaum invented the blind signatures parts and Adam Back invented HashCash, which is the foundation for PoW.

This is the crux of the problem.  Most (all?) cryptocurrency anonymity schemes rely on the ability to hide in a crowd.  If only 5 people are using a scheme then that is a small enough number to consider all suspect for whatever purpose (law enforcement, competitive business intelligence, civil law suit).  But if it's 5 million, 5 thousand, or 500 then you hit a critical mass where it is effectively anonymous.
Hence the developers of the schemes have a motivation to force as many diverse kinds of people into using it as possible.  The only way to get a critical kind of diversity (the "I've got nothing to hide" crowd that is genuinely clean) is to build it into the protocols so they never have to think of turning it on.

The problem with transparency is competition.  The exchanges ultimately don't care if the government knows all their transaction details.  It's the competitor exchanges they need to keep secrets from.  
So a full transparency on the blockchain for a competitive exchange is actually a disadvantage unless everyone does it.  And when everyone does it there is a huge competitive advantage to be the first to offer the slightest bit of opaqueness.  It's prisoner's dilemma in an economic sense.
