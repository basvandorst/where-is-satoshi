Thanks so much for your reply, ahhh man. Wish it was 100% positive news but its definitely worth a shot.

Also, is it obvious that the address that received the coins is a BCH address? 
At the top it says Bitcoin Address....i'm hoping my mistake maybe isnt a mistake after all? I'm 90% sure it is, but gosh im trying everything I can

Part of me really wants to be angry because I looked around and saw how many other people got mixed up in this, and the other part wants to educate. How silly would I look if I did a slightly self-deprecating video in which I warned people to be very freaking careful when transferring their funds? Might get my Comp Sci degree snatched back, but God forbid someone loses millions because of copycats

I am so sorry dude...did you send it to their regular support email? I've had nothing but great experiences w/ Coinbase up to this point, but knowing how many support tickets they have I have no idea when/if they'd get back to me anyhow. Hope you didn't lose a large amount....even 1 cent is a lot lost tbh

Thank you for the heads up! And yeah I thought about that once I posted and was like wait a minute....it's still the same amount. Will look into other wallets ASAP!
