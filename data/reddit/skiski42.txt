A future is an agreement between a buyer and seller to make a trade at a future date at a fixed price. This is very common for commodities such as oil and corn. 
If someone thinks he can predict prices in the future better than the market, then he may buy or sell based off of that knowledge. Let's say that a barrel of oil is trading at $100 right now but futures are selling at $110 per barrel (the market thinks that barrels of oil will be up $10 between now and that date). The trader is confident that oil prices will be above $110 at the futures date, so he buys a future for 100 barrels at $11,000. When the futures date arrives, the seller is obligated to sell him 100 barrels at $110 (no matter what the current price is). If the trader is right, and a barrel is $115 on that date, the the trader just made $500 dollars because he bought $11,500 worth of oil for only $11,000. However if he is wrong and oil is down to $90 a barrel, then the trader just lost $2,000 because he bought $9,000 worth of oil for $11,000.
Buying futures with Bitcoin is going to be very interesting because of the volatility of Bitcoin. Imagine if someone asked you to predict Bitcoins price a month out.. it could be $8,000 or $80,000. However because there are no current tools to predict Bitcoin price. the wildly speculative Bitcoin futures market will likely be a key indicator that Bitcoin traders look at to predict price. Since most investors believe that the price will be going up, I have a feeling that Bitcoin futures will be trading much higher than todays value. People will likely start to buy more as they will see today's market for Bitcoin as undervalued since the futures are higher.

Rare doesn't equal valuable

What you're referring to is an "option" which is similar to a future but the buyer has the "option" to execute. You're obligated to pay the fee (premium) regardless of what happens.

I completely agree with you there. I don't think most of the people who are putting money into Bitcoin have a strong grasp on financial markets. "Investors" is a strong word for what is essentially gambling. 
My post isn't to say "this is why Bitcoin is the future". It is more "here is why I think Bitcoin futures are going to further inflate the current bubble"

For bitcoins, buying futures is essentially gambling on the future price. The majority of people buying Bitcoin futures will not be buying it to hold. 
If someone buys a future then they are making bet about the price on a certain date. If the price is higher than the price on the future then they win the bet and they get to collect the difference. If the price is below the price on the future the they lose the bet and they lose the difference.

It's like a roulette wheel because there is no asset behind it. All that people are doing is guessing supply/demand for a piece of code that doesn't do anything. At some point when the hype dies people are going to realize that they have their money tied up in something useless and they are going to run fast. 
The argument that it a "currency" is insane. Currency needs to be inflationary by design and there is no currency in the world that is more volatile than bitcoin. The only real "value" that bitcoin brings  is for keeping transactions private.

Be careful with any responses you get to this, not a single person here has any real idea what's going to happen with bitcoin prices. Many people believe it's going to the moon (and it might) but that is not based on any real information. 
Imagine bitcoin is a roulette wheel, when it lands on black it goes up, when it lands on red it goes down. A lot of people have been putting their money on black and they have been winning a lot. They believe they know discovered the secret to making money (bet on black). The issue is that their past successes have no indication of the future. Bitcoin may (will?) start landing on red eventually and those people are set to lose a lot of money if they keep betting on black.

The lack of assets behind crypto currencies is the biggest risk. When you buy a stock or a mutual fund you are buying a piece of a company which includes physical assets along with intellectual property. With bitcoin there is no asset that you are owning.
People on this sub will say that the USD or other fiat currency has no intrinsic value too since it's not backed by gold anymore, but that it not entirely true. There is an entire government body who's sole purpose is to regulate and protect the value of your dollars. That regulation and protection of your value and purchasing power is an asset. 
Remember beanie babies? The price of beanie babies skyrocketed in the late 90's. Wrote books about how much they would be worth 20 years later and how they were a smart investment. Now they are worth very little.. the big difference between beanie babies and a crypto coin is that a beanie baby still had value after the market crashes (kids can play with them or you can use them as a decoration) with crypto, if the price starts to crash then they are worth next to nothing.

It is "investing" in the same way that going to the casino and playing roulette is "investing"
