Which has been happening this year in Japan. Now wall street is getting in, and they want to use it to move money around internally. There's fear they just want to short and cash out, but when they're talking about using it, wrap it up. This is it.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:50:17

They also want to adopt it to move money around. So yes there is the possibility they want to short the shit out of it. It's unlikely because they want to use it for internal networks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:09
hahaha, right
im just trying not to throw up on the roller coaster, got in yesterday and now have to wait a week for it to officially arrive anyway
apparently that nearly 20k spike and crash within an hour was someone day trading 14440 btc, [they made 200mil](
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:21:00
they just did an update last night as well

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:37:41
seriously, im a majority ltc holder now, i just cant get myself to move it all into it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:34:58
yeah, when it crashes to 12 after hitting 15 and is at 20 next week
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:32:36
The hundreds of trades you watch flicking by on gdax are mostly sub 1 btc trades,with the occasional 2-3-4-5 btc trades. When there are hundreds or even thousands of people with sell orders placed at a certain price, and that guy comes along and buys them all at once with a massive amount, it spikes the price up of blowing through all those sell orders. On top of that day traders follow suit trying to get in on the sky rocket and turn around sell which is why over the course of an hour we saw it spike upwards of 20 and settle back into 16-17.
What they did was watch price spiking due to massive buys and they bought in. Buys kept happening and within an hour they sold at a higher enough price, that then there sell spiked the price way down and other people started selling as well on the way down.
Sort of like mass hysteria.

First started watching a year ago and may was my initial.. i should get in on this, of course not doing so.. then watching the 3 major corrections, at least i got in during the ride up around 13.5k, it went up 2k just in the time of verification/xfer etc from deciding at 11
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:49:17
Seriously, no one's gonna double up the dbz meme?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:56:26
I was amazed watching the 14.4 wall about 12 hours ago on gdax.
I've hit that utter fascination I'm not sure what to feel watching it right now.
I think I'm kinda indifferent in that my buy yesterday is locked in for a week until the xfer is validated.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:52:55
13.5, i went ltc though

someone in that thread theorized the winklevoss did a market timing on that 14440 buy/sell
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:54:52
its serious, about 60 of it sold so far

the flip side of this is, everyone was pushing people to send to your own wallet with your own key so you would get the bcash fork
however, coinbase credited peoples accounts with bcash for whatever bitcoin they owned at the fork, while no one else did
and also the obvious 8500 bcash price has been corrected

december 10th is the first wall street buy in
people are scrambling this week to get in before them
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:38:37
wall street btc futures starts monday, 3 or 4 more firms are gettign in over the next month
they want to create internal networks with it to move money around easier

I got in today.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:48:26
the x factor is the wall st firms wanting to create internal networks to move money around using bitcoin
i think theyre going to keep buying, while also betting on it because of this
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:07:03
Yeah there's been 3 20-30% dips this year. The first one took roughly 2-3 weeks to recover. The other 2 took less than 3 days.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:37:10
this might be an initial pump and dump though, however exacerbated by all the media attention so everyone else jumping on board though
if today hasnt interesting enough, i expect monday to probably crash big, but will depend on how many people decide to hold though
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:19:07
i have no shit left to lose :P
i was up about 66% monday from two weeks ago and now down 35% of that in the last two days :P
my only wish is i could get better info on bch vs btc instead of two extremely biased sides that seem to hate each other
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:16
The thing is they want to create their own internal networks to more easily move money around using it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:45:22
im watching it get eaten, not fast, but its down to 900
next hurdle 18k, briefly breached earlier today.. honestly my next alert is set for 20
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:02:27
this week is everyone jumping on board before wall street starts getting involved next week
ive watched this shit for a year now and im tired of kicking myself, id be worth more than half a mil if i just jumped in then, and im still thinking back to may at serious consideration.. at this point ive watched 3 20+% corrections

welcome to the club
i started looking last year at 5-800
seriously thought about may at 1800
finally decided monday at 11.2, [sitting here today buying in at 13.5](
seriously lost out on almost a grand because of a 24 hour delay because coinbase's app was buggy trying to verify payment method.. and they have initial weekly limits you can purchase

just a 15k bubble, nothing to see here

They put in the buy for 14440, basically buying thousands of transactions at once. But it registers as a 14440 buy.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:16:13

There's something extremely melodic about their language in song. The fastest we hear in the english language is rap like eminem, but even then its more like him speaking rather than singing.

part of me wants to see it crash, but only because im jealous i didnt invest in may at 1800, which was apparently the best time to invest for late to the party types
i thought maybe the 5k-3300 correction would keep going a bit...
fuck it ill just keep playing win for life scratch offs

You. You're what I should've done. I started to look last year around 500-800. In May I thought.. 1800 seems like a good idea to get in.
At this point I'll just keep playing scratch offs.

Let me rephrase that hypothetical for you.
Google stock was around $1000 a share in 2013, so you sell 2 shares and buy the $2000 tv.
Now its 940, so you think you paid 1860 for a 2k tv..
Only the difference is, 4 years ago no one knew bitcoin would jump $3000, or google would drop 60, so actually the guy paid 2,000 for the 2,000 tv.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:37:26
I had been following it for quite some time. I would've stayed through the 5k crash as well.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:51:04
i decided against investing 30k at 1800 5 months ago :P
i couldve turned 30k into over 100k in less than half a year
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:15:37
Here I am trying to get back to that investment decision a few months ago at 1800.
