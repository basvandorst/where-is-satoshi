Yes but you might be cheaper getting Revolut ( its a phone app/bank account.
Use the revolut account for transferring any money in or out of coinbase. It gives interbank rates on currency exchanges with local bank details. So you will get a USA bank account a British one a European one etc 25/26 different currencies with localised accounts.
Load it up with dollars exchange some for euros and transfer euros to your coinbase account then send it to gdax and you can trade in euros instead if the rate is more favourable.
Details on transferring from coinbase to Gdax.  
I do all my trading in euros as Im UK based and its the stronger currency, Euro transfers take max 1 business day unless bank holidays are a factor. Done hundreds of transfers without issue. Also remember to keep the volume low. Doing a 10k transfer will likely raise red flags for money laundering tax evasion etc so be smart about the amounts you move in single transactions/per month, or you account will get flagged and you will face delays.
Note the delays are the banks not coinbase 90% of the time.

Use their exchange GDAX on the daily, took 600 euro out on the 23rd as the banks were closed i got quoted the 28th for the transaction to complete completed on the 26th. Sounds like an issue specific to USD/american banks causing problems I expect.

though GDAX have region based trading so dollars might be your only option. That said revolut will likely be worth looking at as their transfer fees are cheap along with exchanges.
For example my bank charge £15 for standard and £25 for a rush. Where as revolut its like £0.15 per transfer.
