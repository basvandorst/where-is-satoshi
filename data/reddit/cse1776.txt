It's the speculation up to the halving that creates the interest then it will cool off. Up to the halving and after the halving the value spikes by itself because supply and demand take over.

Unless you're a professional trader looking at the right setup every hour of the day this is your destiny. Embrace it! We can't all be Full Time crypto traders! Define what you are and then stick with the plan. Day Trader-quit yoir job then learn TA and have a plan, Swing Trader- same, Position Trader- Ditto, Investor=buying all the time. Anything under the last ATH will make returns during this next insane Bullrun that's on the verge of commencing!!! I bought the top and bottom of every single move up last round and 10x'd my Fiat! To me now in Bitcoin I'm focused on 2040. We're going to hit a million and IMHO more like hyperbitcoinization will take place. How long does it take, anyone's guess. Buy untill then and then it won't matter how much the Fiat value is. You'll only want your Bitcoin.

Doesn't that weaken the trust and value of the coin? I'll admit I'm a noob, and trying to get people to get into Bitcoin. But when you here of more altcoins being created whenever there's a disagreement you wonder if the fabric is getting weaker when you do that? So there's 21 million Bitcoin BTC, BCC, BCU , BCH, now in November another one to come? Isn't that 104,000,000 Bitcoin Divided by 5 types? Which type wins? The type the miners pick? So that makes you scared to invest in $3500 Bitcoin if it isn't going to be the main coin.

This is what the FED does... Create more currency. There's no difference. They're turning into what Satoshi created this to destroy.

Isn't trustless more defined by the fact that someone cannot cancel a payment to me and I don't have to trust my account to a central bank. My assets cannot be frozen Etc. Not in not being able to trust it as a valid currency. If you can't trust it as it value currency then retailers will never accept it as payment. I am a small business owner. Why would I ever put a Bitcoin or Litecoin in my store if every other week it may be a different coin?

I think it'll drop back to 5900 after fork. Just my opinion. Who knows. You could be right.

Personally that's all it ever was for me. I don't like Bitcoin for online payments. No protection from fraud. Face to face purchases I'm ok with Bitcoin.  I only use credit card online it's the only way to protect from getting ripped off. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:46:03
I learned this the hard way. It didn't take me long to say wait! Is my goal to aquire more fiat or Bitcoin? HODL!

It's the name. It will always be king. It had the technology first and the name. It's the same reason McDonald's crappy hamburgers are the biggest in the business. They were the first fast food joint and a name you can't replace. Litecoin comes close. But really who wants to spend a Monero or a NEM ? Sounds so lame. I want Bitcoin. Everyone wants bitcoin...

I sold my 1.35 BTC after first failed bounce from 19.8k to 10.3k to 17k. Then at 15 I was out. I knew it wasn't going to rebound like it had. I had 23k at the ATH off an $1800 investment. I sold and took 18k &amp; 10x my money. Good job right? I was so tired of watching the charts in the middle of the night I was ready to give up on Bitcoin. But I believe in the revolution, I believe couldn't get it of my mind so I started just buying 100 a week. I have about .2 BTC. Hindsight. I wish I would of bought the first Bitcoin and locked it away in cold storage and came back in 2030. Now I have 15% of the Bitcoin I had for the same cost basis as the first 1.3 BTC. Live and learn...

Oh wait and let me add that I now owe $3500 in capital gains tax. So I actually am in worse shape than just HODLing long term. That's your best bet with Bitcoin. It IS the blockchain there is no other shitcoin that will take it's place. It's all speculation with every other copy cat nonsense. If you want to day or swing trade in crypto then you can make some money but I suggest that you actually do something that gives something back to society instead of take from some poor slub that FOMO's into some abscure shitcoin looking to get rich. I can't live with myself if thats what I do for a living. I'd rather get up create jobs for other people and invest in solid technologies like Bitcoin and others and let the money I create by giving someone something besides the false hope of getting rich quick work for me and get rich slow myself.
