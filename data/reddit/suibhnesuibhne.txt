Be careful with this.  I wrote a reply, which was instantly deleted from the site.   Hence, for a 'big' story, they have 2 replies in total (the ones they like).
My reply - 
The reality is - BTC hasn't risen with super huge gains at all. It's just steady and popular. The concept that this exchange is inflating the price to protect themselves is hyperbole, the likes of which help you get published in lots of crypto spaces, and help you get more subscribers to your content.
Most of the alts have experienced FAR better gains than BTC, hence the dominance of alts is almost HALF of the crypto market. I suppose Bitfinex is responsible for each individual alt gain too?
BTC will always be the name brand, the mascot and the flagship of Crypto - and almost every Crypto investor has some. With the very, very limited supply of these things, it's not hard to do the math. I know of many, many people entering the Crypto sphere, and bringing with them loads of money. Of the money they bring, a huge % sits in BTC, with its very limited supply.
If BTC were an alt coin with the same supply, we would EXPECT the price to rise, even if it weren't popular. It doesn't take a mathematician to work out that the rise of BTC is organic (maybe even a little slow), in line with its finite supply, market dominance, and extra fiat being dumped into the Crypto sphere.
This is just another attempt at hyperbole from a blogger who wants to be known. It's the 'dodgy plumber' story on your current affairs show, or the Bill O'Reilly on politics. Everyone shares it and reads it, but even to someone with high school maths - it doesn't check out.
Cool story, bro!
