None of those attacks would affect your average Linux desktop.  They're much more relevant to servers.  Ubuntu, at least, doesn't even install ssh out of the box. I don't know of any desktops that run SSL servers. Shellshock could be a problem, but you'd have to be doing something like running CGI so that remote users have some control over the computing environment.
So you listed 3 Linux vulnerabilities from the last 6 years. How many are there for Windows in that time...

That just be new. When they first rolled out bitcoin the store didn't support it, only the bundles did.

Can you make a 2-of-3 multi signature transaction with credit cards? Can you even send money to a friend with credit cards? Bitcoin is most certainly faster than a 3 business day bank transfer, and definitely faster than mailing a check.
So Bitcoin can  do things that other systems can't, and it's definitely faster than other systems. "Works less well" is too vague to even bother with.  I don't think anyone is claiming bitcoin is better than every other system in all cases, but it clearly has its merits.

Yes, credit card fraud can happen because it's a horribly designed system with no security. It'd be like giving everyone your bitcoin private key and then saying "please only take the right amount, and don't take more in the future."

I hope you're at least also accepting bitcoin for your biz.  You can be part of the solution, even if you don't stop using Paypal entirely

So then how does anyone ever get their credit card number stolen?

The credit card system is hardly "the best system." It's petty naïve to think that we stumbled on the most perfect and unimprovable  financial system in the 1960s.
Even if you want to support offline transactions, that doesn't mean you have to compromise security in every case. Indeed, you can make transactions without connectivity with bitcoin. The seller would be subject to a double spend attack in theory, but that seems preferable to being subject to a double spend attack on the consumer in every case.

BIP70 seems to rely on the same Certificate Authority infrastructure as HTTPS does. Doesn't that mean it will have all the same flaws as HTTPS?

Thanks that was very informative. I see now that they are solving a different sort of MITM attack than I was expecting.

Of course it is majoritarian. Whatever 51% of the hashing power says, goes. That's kind of the entire underlying principle.
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:59:05
The only protocol that matters is the protocol enforced by 51% of the hashing power. If 51% disagree with you about what the protocol is, you lose. At that point that hash power will be generating the longest chain, and could be used to actively attack/double spend any smaller chains. It doesn't matter if you call it an attack or a bug or a feature, it's an inherent property of the bitcoin protocol. Once 51% disagree with you, you can no longer safely use the system. I'd call that majoritarian.

Here's an idea for defining altcoin vs. fork.  I don't think I've seen this proposed anywhere else.  A system is an altcoin if it uses different rules for generating the hash of a block.  Otherwise, it is a fork.  Here's why this is important: from a practical standpoint, whatever group controls 51% of "compatible" hashing power, effectively controls the consensus rules.  If that group doesn't like the consensus rules you're using, then they can make your system unusable by e.g. double spending coins.  So, you either play by their rules or you lose.  It may not be a pretty or nice idea, but I don't see how a competing system using different consensus rules but the same hashing algorithm could exist in this scenario.
Some interesting results with this definition: it doesn't even require the same genesis block for two systems to be "forks."  Litecoin would still be considered an altcoin, since it uses s-crypt instead of SHA.  XT would not.
Okay, tell me why I'm dumb :-)

I think that article overstates the limitations of end to end encryption in the browser. While it's true that I have to trust protonmail.ch, I don't have to trust every server in between. Additionally, since the code that runs in the browser is JavaScript, it is possible (if not exactly feasible) to audit it.

I was surprised to see a link about Bitcoin in the State Farm eNewsletter, and even more surprised at the fair presentation it got!

They did, and their security is greatly improved now. You probably shouldn't trust an exchange that hasn't been hacked yet.

You mean, like cash? Which is exactly what bitcoin intends to be, the digital equivalent of cash.

Nope i didn't have the physical gift card with me, and they weren't able to enter the numbers manually, so i had to pay another way.

I'm having some trouble with my order.  I submitted a question through "Contact Us" on the website, but have not gotten a reply for several days.  So I turn to reddit for help.  I got the first two emails for my order, but not the third, and I confirmed that my phone has not been credited.  My Order ID: a9a114da-2c94-47e5-a15e-aac66c3e20e6

You only have to trust them for as long as it takes to transfer the balance of the private key to a key that you control. So, the same as a standard transaction. The difference is that more of the transaction is handled by the receiver. In fact, the sender need not have any electronics if he has a QR code of the private key.

Did you try checking your balance from an international number?  If so, did you get an error back in response?  I've been trying to check my balance, to no avail...

I've attempted to used gyft gift cards at two locations, now.  Both times, the cashier had to ask for help from another employee.  At Papa John's Pizza, they were able to successfully complete the transaction.  At Taco Bell, they could not.  "The computer won't let us type in all the digits," they said.
So, while I'm glad that it worked for you, know that some places might have difficulty with a gift card on a phone.

In my experience most people who are "uncomfortable" with firearms are simply not knowledgeable about or experienced with them.  I've personally taken several such people to the gun range (good on them for being open-minded), and they've all expressed that they were much less uncomfortable with the concept of the right to keep and bear arms afterwards.  If possible, I recommend you try the same.

Yes, i had a physical gift card for taco bell and entered it. Would you expect the businesses for whom you sell gift cards to be more accustomed to phone-based cards?
