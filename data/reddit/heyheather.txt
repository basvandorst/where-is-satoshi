Also, if a corporation runs out of money, they disappear from the market.  If the government runs out of money, they just... borrow more from the Federal Reserve and/or they just raise taxes.  and to whom are they going into debt to?  Who are they paying back this money to?  Well, they created the Fed, then borrow money from them... Except that the Fed does not need to actually be paid back, because the dollar is not based on a finite resource.  It is just pieces of paper, and/or numbers on a bank's computer, therefore they can increasingly issue massive amounts of debt with no risk whatsoever.  
I can't see how this monetary system can, in any way, promote fiscal responsibility or efficiency. 
Once again, when corporations mismanage money, they go out of business.  If government mismanages money, they just get a bigger budget.

In reference to the ISP thing, which I know very little about... Why do you feel it is preferable for one agency to have 100% control over who is allowed access to the internet?  Does it not bother you that a small group of bureaucrats would have total control over who provides internet access?  
What if the government only allows pro-government ISPs?  What if they "regulate" the ISPs and force them to allow certain content and disallow other content?  What if 99% of people vote for this kind of system, and force certain types of content to be banned?  It seems to me that problems are far more likely to arise in a centralized monopoly system as opposed to a decentralized market system.

Your definition of government is misleading at best. Government is not a voluntary coming-together of people to solve problems. Government is an exogenous group of people who have exempted themselves from the rules they hold their subjects to. Our current system is just an outgrowth of the kingship and divine right to rule. Nobody was ever given the option to opt out of the government's rules and create their own governments with other willing participants. Governments are the result of conquering and violent overthrow. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:52:52
Last time I checked, nobody ever allowed me to opt out of being serviced by local, state, or federal government. The argument of the 13 states is useless as all of those people involved are long dead. 
Government is a voluntary agreement among a very small minority of people to force their governance on a much bigger population. You either do what government says or you get jailed. And if you resist, you can be killed. That does not sound voluntary to me.

Oh I understand it.  Extortion is when you threaten violence or harm to someone if they so not do not give you the money or property you want from them.

It is quite simple.

I am more interested in freedom and market competition than efficiency. It just so happens I think a market system can produce higher efficiency than a state system. 
What incentive does the government have to be efficient, anyway?  They do not need to compete with anyone and they are in no danger of losing market share.  
No corporation in the world can even come close to the amount of money that the government makes.   The US Dollar, for example, is controlled by the Federal Reserve. Which was created by Congress. The currency is centrally managed and can be counterfeited at will and masses of money can be given to anyone they wish, and they don't even have to tell you who they gave it to.  They give most of it to government in the form of treasury bills. This is fancy talk for "they basically pull imaginary money out of their ass, and threaten anyone elae with ruin if they challenge the primacy of the currency or try to compete with a different currency". If you dont believe me, google "Bernard von Nothaus"
A corporation operates for profit because they have to make money first before spending it. They can go into debt or borrow, but if they do not keep their cash flow high enough, they will default and go out of business. In order to get profit, they must offer a product or service to customers who want to buy it. If they do not please customers, they do not make money, and you know what happens. 
But what about government?  Government does not offer goods or services to willing customers. They force you to become a consumer of their product because they have stamped out anyone who would compete with them. They achieve this through threats of violence, or violence itself, if necessary.  Because there is nobody to undercut their prices, they do not have to offer thr product at a price that accurately reflects its market value.  Instead of giving the consumer the option to buy your product, they simply threaten you with violence and take however much money they want. In return they give you the "services" they think you deserve.  
Is it any wonder that computer technology made by market companies has exploded with progress, yet the traffic light has not changed in 100 years. Don't you think it is strange that the government never innovates anything?
Actually there is one thing they do innovate often: warfare. This is because the world is in a state of anarchy on the international level. Countries, run by parasitic psychopathic individuals, are in competition with one another to be the most armed and defensible. This is the same mechanism that drives innovation in the free market. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:51:38
These thinga can be done without government and without force. 
I believe that the market can produce peaceful solutions to problems that people want to solve. 
Not having a government doesnt mean not having roads. In fact, government hires private contractors to build roads, so it seems that consumers and businesses could do these things directly. Government does not allow choice or market competition for these goods and services you mentioned, but rather imposes ota solution (whether effective or not) at a price of its choosing. They can also choose to raise prices at any point, and you and I are not allowed to take our money to another provider. 
I do not want to eliminate goods and services the government currently provides, but rather let free market agencies compete for customers. 
Just because the government does a certain thing does not mean that thing can not be done without government.

The point I am trying to make is that the state is not the determiner of what is a crime and not a crime. All they do is determine what you will be punished for. Crime in the true definition of the word is in aggression on a person or that person's property. If I steal, fraud, or initiate violence or threats of violence upon you, then that is a crime. Everything else is just legal bullshit to help the state have more control and make more money. Also, the biggest drug dealer in the world is the Central intelligence agency.

It is not about him being "above the law"... The law is illegitimate.  No drug dealer should be arrested, and no drug user should be arrested.  The organization doing the arresting should be disbanded.
I am not trying to argue that he did not break the government's laws.  I am suggesting that those laws are wrong and have no legitimate authority.  They are only the "law" because the government uses violence against people that break them.  They kidnap and lock people into cages for selling unapproved vegetation to one another.

I could completely ignore the factor that differentiates the two, but I will not.  You simply want me to ignore the very thing that destroys your argument. 


Virtual territory, if you want to call it that, is radically different than actual territory.  For one, virtual territory does not take up any space other than the hard drive space required to store its information on.  That is so small that it is insignificant.  Virtual territory is infinite and takes up no physical space. real territory is finite, and operates in physical space.

@_date: 2015-02-06 15:02:11
You just don't get it.  You are so off that I don't even know how to address this anymore. 
Silk road is a voluntary platform operating like ebay or amazon.  They are a business providing a marketplace in which you sell products or buy products.  They have certain fees and such for participating, but that is simply a business model.  
The circumstances are in no way related to mafia circumstances.  The mafia does not offer a voluntary protection service. They come to your business and say " if you dont pay me money to protect you, i will hurt you". Silk road has no such threat or enforcement.  It is opt in or opt out. You cant opt out of mafia protection and you cant opt out of government either. 
So you just dont get it. It is that simple. Government operates like a mafia, not silk road. And if government didnt threaten people with violence for selling and buying drugs, silk road would not have to operate in secret and so anonymously. 
Also, silk road is not a territory. Its a website, and it is not the only online marketplace. Would you consider ebay to be a territory run by a mafia?  
If you cant grasp this now, you never will.

Silk Road was a completely different model than the mafia. Silk Road did not use extortion or violence in any way against anyone.

Yeah you are right. The world is currently dominated by psychopathic authoritatian nutjobs.  However, i think government will eventually be overtaken by black and grey markets.

universally?  That is the point… that it is not universal.  Contract law will be enforced by the parties that bound themselves to it.  Why would it need to be universally enforced?  Even under the current system of statism around the world, contracts are not universally enforced.  I se no need for that.


This is perhaps the worst example of a contract that I have ever seen.  I can't even comment on it because it is so silly.  If you can give me a better example of a contract that someone would actually sign and enforce, then I can give you my input.  


I am simply confused as to what you are trying to say.  What do you mean by "jurisdiction"?  The only jurisdiction in a stateless situation is the contract between individuals and the private property of those involved.  With that said, I don't believe that a property owner has the right to just arbitrarily make whatever he wants "illegal" and punish those for it.  He may try, but I don't think it would be justified.


Sounds like you are talking about the creation of a state
