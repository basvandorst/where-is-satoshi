Couldn't they just store the money as bitcoin, and when needed, cash it out as dollars at a bitcoin ATM?

USD functions as legal tender which means that it is recognized as valid for meeting any financial obligation. 
In other words: if you owe BTC, you can choose to pay back in UDS. So what's the problem?
At the end of the day accepting BTC will generate more income (in dollars) and at the same time slashing transaction costs. So why on earth would they care about weather it is regarded a currency or not?

Yes, but for how long? "limited time only"...

Guess they still have to pay Fees to VISA, but it still makes sense due to the high inflation rates in Argentina.

Or maybe not. 
If I could get bitcoins at a lower price at a phillippino exchange than on a foreign one I'd buy a fuckload of phillipino pesos, then buy bitcoins and then sell it all at a foreign exchange for dollars/pounds or whatever would give me the most profit.
With increased liquidity I don't see why the market for bitcoins should behave different from any other currency traded on the open market.
In other words: the problem isn't inbalances caused by selling pressure into the remmitance markets but lack of liquidity. With increased popularity the problem will solve itself.

Would have paid to read the piece if only they had a bitcoin paywall. Fiat paywall is just too much hassle to be bothered :/

China defining Bitcoin as a commodity = regulating it as barter
It could have been a lot worse.

UK banks may let you get away with low or no fees, but they sure make you pay through your noses bailing them out.

The cost of this security as a % of Bitcoins total value will fall along with the risk involved in mining investments. Right now that risk is way higher than it will be 3-4 years from now. In other words - the cost of security as a percentage of bitcoins total maket cap will plummet.
