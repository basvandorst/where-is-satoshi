Also if you think only criminals use bitcoins for transactions you're naive and presumptuous and are probably repeating the rhetoric of some uninformed source

Rare that anyone uses it as a currency? What are you talking about? People exchange it for good and services, the definition of currency lol.
There is a finite amount of gold, just like bitcoin, and the value of gold has increased over time. Is gold a Ponzi scheme? Paper currency's valuation once represented gold and silver. Now, as it's printed at will of the government, it is inherently inflationary. Bitcoin is finite and therefore deflationary, one reason for it's value to increase, in addition to it's applications beyond a medium of exchange.

Gold is also finite and deflationary. Are you still stating then that this is not a valid currency? This was only the US system for 180 years up until the 1970s.
There are multiple currencies in the world buddy. The USD, the GBP, etc and they're value in comparison to one another constantly fluctuates. Many people play the foreign currency exchange market looking to exploit these changes in relative values. Bitcoin as a currency also fluctuates in comparison and is now at a higher USD valuation. So you can't use this as an argument as to why it's not a legitimate currency. Otherwise the USD falls into the same category. 
 If there were no other currencies except Bitcoin, of course there would be no HODLers. But because the current dominating currency is fiat people will obviously exploit the valuation increase in the short term. If you had Mexican pesos in your pocket and their value vs the USD started to rise and you thought it would keep going you wouldn't trade it right away for UDS, you would.... guess what, HODL.
