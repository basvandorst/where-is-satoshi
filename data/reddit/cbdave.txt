Coinbase employee here. We're still working on ETC withdrawals and will announce a firm date in the next ~10 days.
It takes time for us to build a new feature like this. Understand this is frustrating for our users who wish to withdraw and hope you continue to be patient with us whilst we're working on it.

We're a regulated company in the US so periodically need to collect information from our users – some more info here 
ID verification isn't only for high volume traders and can vary by which payment method you are using. Our customer service will be able to give you more detail on this, but uploading your ID should be the quickest way to return buy functionality on your account.

Coinbase employee here. Not aware of any issues on our end. I just tested in chrome and couldn't see the option to use bitcoin in the cart, but when I went through to the checkout the option was listed next to the other payment methods. Were you looking for the option in the cart or the checkout page?

Coinbase employee here. Sorry for the inconvenience. Could be a couple of issues, and hard for me to pinpoint without looking into your account, but most likely we need you to upload a copy of your ID. 
We understand our ID upload isn't perfect, and we're working on a few improvements, but if you try again in better light that normally works.

[Coinbase here]( I've looked into this and it was a payment bug which impacted a small number of users and has now been fixed – the funds should be in your account.
I'm sorry it took so long for this to get resolved. 10 days isn't acceptable. I know doesn't help in this case, but we're investing more resources to make sure payments bugs like this happen less frequently and get resolved much faster when they do.

[Coinbase here]( Appreciate you sharing feedback and understand why you are frustrated. Hopefully this will clarify the situation and some of your concerns --
It is up to each user to calculate and report taxes associated with their bitcoin trades. Coinbase provides a report as a tool to assist users in this process. Using Coinbase’s tax report does not determine your tax liability or lock you into filing your taxes based on the report.
By default, transactions into or out of your Coinbase wallet are reported as buys or sells at the current market price because we do not have visibility outside our platform. Users are free to apply any appropriate accounting method in calculating their taxes. If you have other information about a particular transaction - for example a bitcoin send from your Coinbase account to another wallet you control - then you may choose to take that into account in filing your taxes. You can read more about our report [here](
EDIT: corrected a quick typo
EDIT 2: Clarification – our report gives users a cost basis to provide extra info in case you sold it offsite. This report is for your personal use only. Coinbase is not sending this report to the IRS. If in the event we are required to provide information to the IRS, we will not record a send transaction as a sell.

[Dave from Coinbase here]( We recently rolled out Segwit on Coinbase, and as part of this roll-out, our BIP70 payment protocol implementation was impacted. Specifically, the address contained in the payment request payload was not Segwit compatible.
As soon as we were notified about the issue we started working to resolve and the issue was fixed within hours. Less than 30 customers were affected by the issue and we've issued refunds to all customers. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused.

[Coinbase here]( Wanted to clarify our blog post and email for customers asking if Coinbase is keeping bitcoin cash for ourselves.
Coinbase does not intend to interact with the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, or to access bitcoin cash (BCC). In order to safely and securely access bitcoin cash, Coinbase would need to undertake a process of designing and testing significant changes to our systems – including hot and cold storage. This is one of the core reasons customers will not be able to withdraw bitcoin cash after the fork on August 1st, 2017. 
If this decision were to change in the future and we were to access bitcoin cash, we would distribute to customers bitcoin cash (BCC) associated with bitcoin (BTC) balances at the time of the fork on August 1st, 2017. Coinbase would not keep the bitcoin cash associated with customer bitcoin (BTC) balances for ourselves.

[Coinbase here]( We are aware of this and have been working hard to get it resolved. 
We couldn't accept this wire because the appropriate reference code didn't come through on the payment. We have asked the sending bank to reverse the payment (which is typical here) but they haven't done as requested so far. We'll continue to attempt to get this reversed from the sending bank and if not will try a different method. 
OP appreciate the patience here. Please trust we're working to resolve this and will be in touch directly.
