I just wonder what alts could I buy now, not to keep BTC on binance, to maximize the gains. Already sold the BCH, so pure BTC now.
(not to disappoint you, mainly on gdax/btc anyway)

In ten minutes we will know what happens beyond  the singularity. People buying in everywhere for Bcash. Will it dump after coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:12:29
Ah, so I got it. Good for the coin. I am waiting for a drop and then could invest some ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:28:34
Isn't DASH too high already?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:54:29
Ever heard about Dow folk?

Well, that's bad. There are plenty of predictions, but most feature at least a back-up plan or a few possible scenarios. Anyway, don't wanna sound like a smart egghead, check tradingview for some great insight. You can find many valuable traders there :*

Already have diversified in LTC/ETH, 30-40% of it under current price, the rest up, so I am quite sad now, but I strongly believe it is a matter of days when it bounces back.
I have a small amount of Ether Classic, as it slowly goes up, and just wonder now, what I could do with this 20% of BTC I have on binance. Monero or DASH or nothing :D

What do u mean "it confirms"? I am a non-native english speaker, so I don't get this in the context of trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:40:27
Litecoin also has some tiny fees. One thing is sure, DON'T transfer with BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:57:53
I was kinda looking for some update after the rise had stopped and I think this sums up my feelings perfectly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:00:22
Is GDAX dead? I can't see most of the older charts, no price for BCH apart from dolar, which is 9500, and I can't believe it could be 3 times higher than anywhere else. Apart from that, it is stuck on 9,5k and there is not chart. w t f
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:42
I mean in theory, if I did it now, it would get transfered and then I would place a sell order... But I dunno, it is lagged, and is this a major cause?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:58:58
Not stupid, because it is weird. Buy/sell orders. Loads of people probabely willed to buy in even for like 8-9k xd
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:40:52
What you state in this post is the most coherent with which economic school?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:02:18
Did anyone try an arbitrage from bitstamp to gdax? :P
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:08:54
Would it make sense to transfer some Bcash to GDAX from binance and sell it to ppl willing to buy it at 9k? xd
Or it rather won't work?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:59
Ok, ok, after a while I realised my mistake ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:39:54
I am here because I like the idea, believe that it will rather surely be more expensive in a year than not (LTC, BTC or both) and ofc would like to make some profit. Verge is amazing, but already a bit too expensive now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:27:00
Are u both even serious XD
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:41:27
Holding, not selling even when the price drops.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:11:26
Omg, if the guy bought some crypto with that, he will burn in hell for two eternities.
@_date: 2018-07-02 07:13:11
Ok, guess this is a wrong sub, I've seen things far more edgy with a positive reception. My bad and I offer you apologies.

Finally, some alpha hodlers.

What the hell is MILF.
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:54:02
Same as bitcoin, fun.
And can you please explain what the thought process was when deciding whether or not you should post this comment and to downvote me? Genuinely curious
@_date: 2018-07-02 05:52:15
HODL like MILF
@_date: 2018-07-02 10:25:01
You shouldnt laugh, Mark. Life is way too serious! Bitcoin is serious. We are!!!
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:01:33
Yea like why would you get mad; anyone can call your mum like whatever, but as long as she's yo mama, yo the son, right?
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:07:36
Oh gosh I was sure it was Mum Incredibly Loves Fiat and u tell me weiner oooopsie
@_date: 2018-07-02 10:16:43
Not only a MILF, but a sugar mommy.
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:59:37
Yeah, I thought it would be thought as that. Obviously I am not adressing op's mum, for Christ sake. That's just playing with acronyms, chill out. Tbh I can't see any reason to call anyone's mother a milf directly, LOL.
