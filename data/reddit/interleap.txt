I am fairly new after being a lurker for a while but I feel I would use bitcoin a lot more if it was slightly easier to buy.
I rather pay in fiat then move money from my bank to my wallet using online banking, enter my sellers account details, wait for him to send it, pay for the sites hostings fees during this process (sites I have used require a percentage to be paid by the seller which is then carried over to the customer) and all that to then pay for my item with bitcoin on a site that was not the cost leader because the cost leader happened to not accept bitcoin. 
If I could top up my wallet more effectively I would spend half my bitcoins even if I thought they would be worth 10% more tomorrow because I would know I can buy back what I sent with fiat effortlessly on the same day.

Greeks won't understand the reference. Only teenagers who won't earn a salary worthy enough of opening a bank account to buy bitcoins online until they are 25-28.

So 1 plus 1 equals 10?

I don't understand your reasoning. If you want bitcoin to be fixed to let's say $250, why not buy, $250 worth of dollars and convert and pay using bitcoin when you need to?

It is certainly related. But it is much harder to make someone who has been scared of electronic payments and hackers all their life invest any substantial amount into an app on their phone. Would be heaven for hackers too. So many unencrypted home WiFi networks with expired or no antiviruses.

Difference is people in Greece have debit/credit cards but they choose to not use them. My friends living in Greece don't even know they can use their debit cards to pay online. Some young people in their 20s who you would expect to be up to date with technology think only credit cards work online and would be too scared to buy anything. 
Professionals in the old generations are extremely scared of online payments and cash out 100s or 1,000s of Euros at the start of every month so they can pay for everything with cash. Even direct debit is frowned upon by people who I consider to be very smart in their fields of work. Bills are paid by going to telephone stores or the post office and paying using cash. 
Even stores like e-shop.gr make most of their sales by ordering online and collecting in distribution stores where you pay by cash.
I will be showing my friends bitcoin next time I visit them just to see their reaction to it but I am sure I will get a lot of laughs and comments about how I am crazy to give up real money for bits.

Knowing Greeks it's most likely everyone else thinking Greece will buy bitcoins and cause the price to increase who are causing the price to increase.

Clearly he has not lived in Greece.
The people who would know Banksy would be under 25 and would have never worked a day in their lives. 
I doubt they would save their pocket money in bitcoin when they literally live on a weeks worth of savings. Gold and silver perhaps, offshore investments and bank accounts yes. Bitcoin would be the last thing on their mind in Greece.

From my statistical analysis of all the Greek Bitcoin threads 100% of Greek people own bitcoins.

So the Greek retirement age is now exactly the same as Greece now.
Greece increase from 65 to 67. I don't know where you are all seeing the 45 year olds retire.

Retirement age in Greece is 67 up from 66 last year.
If you are so jealous I am sure people from Greece would switch their benefits with yours.

What country are you in and how much did the $10-20k cost you when you bought the bitcoins.
