Tariffs....Advocated and implemented are 2 very different things. It’s a negotiating tactic to get fairer trade deals. 
Taxes.. he is pushing for a simpler tax code, less regulations, lower corporate and individual taxes. 
Subsidies...I don’t see Trump pushing any Solyndra type disasters

Left wing economists have been wrong about everything since Marx. Look at all of Krugmans predictions on bitcoin. He called it evil! Left wing Statists hate freedom and small government. They will always hate bitcoin as it takes away control from the state. Listen to Milton Friedman. He predicted bitcoins rise.

I was trying to make the same arguments. I agree with everything you stated. Well said.�� bitcoin and statism/socialism are polar opposites

Careful. You might trigger the hordes of leftists who have invaded this sub. My hope is that Bitcoin Red Pills these new bitcoin fans. Maybe BTC will wake them up from the media and academic brainwashing. Bitcoin and cryptos are pro freedom and inherently anti statist and anti socialist. Maybe they will even vote for Trump next time. We can only hope...
