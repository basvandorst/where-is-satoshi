Hi Is trezor hard to use for a newbie. I can't tell my inbox from this thread, every time i click the little envelope icon at the top right of this page it directs me to this thread.

Hi, I tried all my 3 emails to get into my coinbase account as I forgot password and cannot remember which email I registered with coinbase. I joined it in 2013 i think, and I might have used a now defunct email address, do you know how I can access my coinbase account?
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:21:01
Hi I have a coinbase account but cannot remember which email address it is or the password. thanks, I cant send any coins as I have no wallets. Sorry to sound ignorant, dunno if coinbase is a wallet itself.

Hi I emailed the support team but they need the original email address and phone number I reigsterd with, which I dont have.

Hi I have not recovered my wallet as I don't know which site I got it from. I've got screenshots from blockchain.info.tx. I don't know how to identify my private key. I also have a file on my thumb drive with my bitbargain username then.dat after it, for example *******.dat, the asterisks being my bitbargain username, I just don't know what site I set up my wallet with from bitbargain.
Coinbase emailed me today and said that as the email I wrote to them is not reigstered with them,  they are unable to locate a record for me. I have a feeling I might have used them to create a wallet but unsure.

Hi sorry to sound naiive but what do you mean about being careful not to ask questions here like this?
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:12:46
thanks, dont have a wallet, totally ignorant with this stuff, did it years ago
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:32:30
I'd rather keep it public but thanks

Hi I contacted bitbargain as I remembered that site, they said I had no coins in my wallet. They didn't say if it was litecoin or bitcoin, but I definitely bought both types of coin. Does this sound like the wallet has been emptied?
I may write back to bitbargain to ask if it was a litecoin wallet or bitcoin wallet. They also recommended I use phone instead of my particiular email as they silently drop emails unwarranted, whatever that means. Would using phone for bitbargain be safe considering what has gone on with bitbargain recently?

Thanks, how do i restore wallet.dat
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:06:48
thank you
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:13:18
thanks, wont use pm for this type of thing
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:28:30
No I bought it empty from a store, there was nothing on the drive, it was a freshly bought drive. I cannot log into coinbase because they keep asking me for the email and telephone number i used to register with, which I no longer have. I think my wallet is with coinbase. I emailed them for support but they said I need the email address and telephone number which i originally used to reigster with them, but i don't have them.
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:12:13
sorry not sure what you mean, I just looked at an old screenshot associated with litecoin and it says the url is blobk-explorer.com which seems now non existant, cant remember where I purchased the litecoins from
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:21:23
Various wallet.dat files and other non bitcoin stuff. I've got some coinbase screenshots but cant remember email or password, I just tried signing in and hitting "forgot password" and asked it to send me an email to my main email address but have not received it yet.
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:24:03
It says in my email that its coming from my inbox
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:08:33
Hi Sorry to sound dumb but when you say marketplaces do you mean bitbargain?
I now know I ordered coins from there and have now accessed bitbargain, but there are no coins there, does that mean that someone has stolen them as I cannot remember if i created a new wallet from a different site, thanks. As bitbargain has not shut down, but the wallets are empty, how am I going to find out where my coins are? thanks
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:56:50
Thanks for your suggestion, lots of good advice on here but confusing for a newbie.
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:30:24
Thanks, can I transfer from electrum to trezor if I decide i prefer a cold wallet?
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:34:13
No viruses on machine, use excellent paid for security software. Amount greater than $500 Im in the UK - is trezor suitable for a newbie as I don't know anyone who can help.
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:16:39
thanks, just waiting to get my reset code from bitbargain
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:48:59
Please could you post on my public thread, much appreciated, thanks
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:26:40
Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:29:43
That makes sense. How will i find what is in my wallet, e.g. what software would I need to use to find what is in the wallet, thanks
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:20:27

@_date: 2019-08-19 09:08:53
Thanks, bitbargain said i have a wallet but nothing in it, they didnt say whether it was bitcoin or litecoin
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:31:23
I can't remember
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:45:44
Hi, thanks for your reply, I asked because I looked online at a site and it said that it was difficult to use and I could make mistakes.
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:13:00

Hi how do i back up a wallet, do i just do ctrl+c?
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:09:44
I have a few defunct emails, one was with old ISP the others were from email platforms that I forgot, I think there is 3 defunct ones in total
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:50:28
Sorry question was about bitcoin and litecoin as well.
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:15:41
I just found a site I may have purchased them from, will try to log in.
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:07:12

Hi thanks for your message but please can you post on my public thread, I don't trust pm's with this subject, no offence but we are all strangers.

No thumb drive bought by me. bought 2013.
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:21:42
Hello, sorry for the confusion, its the way it is worded on my email. It says I have messages in my inbox, hence the confusion. I don't know anyone who is computer savvy  though.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:52:00
Hi I'm not tech savvy, my tech is well out of date. I came across the wallet.dat files in a thumb drive i was looking at yesterday.
@_date: 2019-09-01 16:42:45
I'm  not a hoax, I wasnt tech savvy then and am not now, i totally forgot I had them until I looked on my usb stick.
