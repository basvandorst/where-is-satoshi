Kraken, and it worked.  Sadly I then shorted DOGE.

The conditions now are new.  The rate of hashrate increase in the last 50 days is unprecedented, as it the stability and depth of the current fall.  I emphasise the word 'could'.

Genesis block was Jan 3rd, 2009 at 18:15 UTC.
4,780,800 minutes / 10 = 478080 blocks.
We are now at block 507702.
507702/478080 = 1.06
Graph showing block times.  If you superimpose bubbles my point gets clearer.
And regarding fees, we are yet to see a crash that totally ruins profitability.  If it happens the only incentive to mine will be high fees.

But the difficulty adjustments are slow, and get slower as the network slows, as explained above.  So "the total hash rate will reduce and the difficulty will reduce" is grossly misleading in a stable decline.

I'm aware difficulty adjustments are quantised, with the next one in 2.4 days at time of writing assuming average ticks of 10mins, and 2016 blocks taking an average of one fortnight.  The predicted difficulty change is to a higher difficulty, which makes the issue worse as a large drop in hash rate would take 2016 blocks to correct, so I'm not sure what you're adding.
Phrased differently, a drop in hashrate increases the time until the next correction, magnifying the problem.  Large changes up or down should always reduce the time until correction.

If the cost falls well below the threshold to mine on modern hardware, then fees become the only reason to mine.  Fees are determined by the supply of processing vs the demand (the transaction queue).  So it may only be viable to process at a rate that processes a couple of blocks each day.  This would destroy bitcoin's value further.
The above scenario seems exceedingly likely in the next week if current trends continue.  I'm frankly alarmed by the cold reaction this post has received.
Of course the current hashrate is in an uptrend despite falling prices, which only makes economic sense if the miners have contrived a quick rise in the next week or have heavily shorted and will create a complete crash with the next diff change.

Modern hardware converts power into hashes more efficiently, so the profitability threshold for modern hardware is a lower BTC price at the same difficulty.  So the price has to fall to that level before disaster.  I'm not sure why you think i meant the sunk cost of the hardware had any baring on the issue.
If new miners are added the hashrate should remain in an uptrend, why it would be temporary on your logic of more miners being produced is unclear from your post.  I expect the hashrate to fall with prices, its interesting to note that it is not (yet).
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:34:01
It seems contradictory to say "it's basic math" and then "...nearly impossible to guess or predict" as all my questions have involved outcomes of the hashrate changing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:23:00
Bubbles are formed by illogical amounts of anti-FUD and FUD.  If you think you'll lose money by continuing to run your miners, you'll turn them off.  If you know everyone doing that will destroy the market you'll consider not doing it for a fleeting moment and do it anyway.  
I agree some people will keep mining, through hope, dogma, ignorance or altruism.  But that doesn't negate the risk entirely.
In any-case, hashrate is still rising sharply, with a predicted difficulty change of +10%,  and the price fall continues.  Global market slump could drive contagion into a further BTC price fall or rescue it as a perceived value store.  The outcome will probably play out over the next 72 hours, and the market may well answer my questions.

unless everyone relies on someone else to do this

Market panic doesn't make sense.  Panic switch off would be exactly the same "Let someone else take the loss to save this, I've sunk enough into my miners already".  When I first posted I didn't realise how low the price would need to drop for this to happen though, as things are right now we'd need to hit about 3KUSD per BTC in the next 7-10 days for it to be a real possibility.

Best assumptions at current difficulties.  Which I thought was obvious from the context of discussing the market as it is now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:21:08
However the time between difficulty corrections increases as hashrate falls.  Catastrophe is unlikely in the immediacy, but a continual rise in hashrate with fall in prices could trigger a hashrate crash.

Except older hardware is being used profitably at the current prices.  The spread of old vs new hardware does not seem to be publicly known.
Addit: The breakpoint is 2K for absolute best assumptions, and about 4K for new gear in real world situations.

Literally any bitcoin market.  I am buying all the shorts once I'm happy the online chat has informed enough impressionable speculators.
