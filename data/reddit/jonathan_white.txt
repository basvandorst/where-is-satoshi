What would work though is an attack on privacy. From the article:






















Essentially, all the malware has to do is snoop on one session, and it knows all your public keys from that point forward. It knows what funds you spent, what funds were your change, and it can link all your addresses together (regardless of whether you use a mixer for additional privacy).

No problem!

I'm thinking of BIP 32 wallets where they could know all the future addresses within an account and not just the current transaction. They could also tie together all the addresses within an account, essentially unveiling (for themselves) any privacy gained through mixers.

This is all back of the envelope, but before we hit the 1MB cap, our best average [rate of growth]( was ~247 transactions a day. According to the OP, VISA is at 386M transactions a day (as of 2016). **It would take us over 4 Thousand Years to reach 2016 VISA levels at that rate.** Clearly, our bottleneck right now is not hardware. It is transaction rate growth. Our problem is that we've spent 5 years as a community solving the wrong problem. And because of this, instead of going exponential, our transaction rate growth has stagnated. Let's make sure we spend the next 5 years as a community solving the right problem!
