Wouldn't a similar setup be required on the buyers side to assure anonymity? 
Why would the seller *have* to know your address? Optimally you'd have at least 3 proxies at any given point, so that even the proxies can't identify a buyer or seller.

Prosecutors screen against this during jury selection. They ask something that boils down to would you vote in a way that would not uphold the law or somesuch. 
as the article says: 


A bad law is still a law, and just because jury nullification is legally permissible doesn't mean that prosecutors can't screen against people who *would* nullify.

By this logic BTH is here to stay: a group of people already have a reason to use bitcoin and they feel oppressed by the current standards.

That's not completely true. I'm not going to open the shitcan of the specifics, but there's transaction fees. "Normal" use of bitcoins below a certain amount isn't smart. There's ways around this but those are usually not worth the effort (specifically because it's for a low values transfer). Depending on how bitcoin is develloped the transaction fees might go down, or not.
