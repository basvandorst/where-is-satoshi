Thx. I gave up months ago. I'm just revisiting this whole thing now. I don't even have Python installed in Windows anymore. I'd have to start from scratch.

I'm not sure. I have a wallet file from 2016.

I wrote a little Excel script that went thru all the possible word, caps, etc.  It uses keystrokes to send the pwd to Electrum. Works fine, takes about 3 minutes to run thru a couple hundred. Obviously not ideal, but I coudln't get the btcrecover script on linx to work.  
What's interesting, and promising, is the first wallet has a transaction from AFTER the date I changed the password, which to me implies that I at one point knew it, but have just forgotten what algo I used.  If I'm normally using AZDJediBTC2017, I maybe started using MyRealNameBTC2017, or whatever.    
I got in once, it's just a matter of time...I hope!

I created a super basic one in Excel that used all the words I figured it could be. I ended up with a list of a couple hundred combinations. No dice. I tried that Linux script but couldn't even get it setup properly.

Same. I have a brain pwd algo that I won't forget. I can't explain this event. It's ironic cos I had many arguments w my buddy about how I'd never forget it. I guess I must have used a different algo for some reason.  Dunno.

I was pretty sure I  knew the password but I tried multiple permutations and none worked.

I odnt know my password, only the seed for one of the wallets.  I made the password the same for both wallets tho.

I can open it fine. Only when trying to send will it ask for password.

Yeah :)

Enough to make a large difference once it moons ;)  
It's an unfortunate event. In the back of my mind I always just believe that the password is somewhere in my brain...and even if I have to wait 10y for computing power to be sufficient enough to brute force it.

The ironic thing is I changed the 2nd wallet's (an ex gf's wallet I'm managing) password to my own password algorithm so I wouldn't forget it lol.  I must have used a new algo tho.  Interestingly, I sent some BTC from the 1st wallet AFTER I changed it...so the password is somewhere in my brain!

There are many examples in history when something happened we didn't expect. I'm not suggesting some sort of technical/bad actor such scenario, but there's a semi-complete thought in my head that I can't quite wrap my head around.  
It goes something like this: The Elite get a majority of the 21m (ignore lost ones for sake of the argument), we have integrated Bitcoin into daily life, and then they decide to slowly control the market (not necessarily the miners) in such a way as to make everybody dependent on their systems, they crash the price...and then they fork.  Sure, we'd still have our 5 satoshis and 51% mining power, but of what use is it in the real world if it becomes a minority currency?  
I dunno, I just foresee something and I can't think clearly on it.
