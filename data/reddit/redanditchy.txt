1. Click on your reddit profile
2. Click on posts
3. Look 5 posts down “MSU stole 1000 of my bitcoin” links directly to a public post on your Facebook profile.

If you click on that guy’s post history you can follow to his Facebook where you can see he is a young guy that claims the local police stole all his bitcoin and that he has a contract with the federal government that his state isn’t honoring to grow weed, he sounds schizophrenic/delusional. You never know who is behind these words and how much you can trust them.

That doesn't sound very shitcoiny to me.

You misspelt will as wil. You have a 15 second video of text with stock footage how did you mess that up? 
And who the hell is spending 1mm on these ads!? I have much better ideas that would take less to implement..

Why would you spend large amounts of money pushing out an ad anyone can make in 15 minutes?

Have miners setup in space halfway between the planets, guarded by private and international security.

I guess I misread, I thought you were saying you can't buy an airline ticket with Bitcoin. Lol it used to be such a hassle winning a bid on eBay then going to the post office to mail a money order.

Isn't this kind of what Litecoin has been sold as?

Initial Coin Offering. Like a crypto IPO

Echo chamber, cesspool, pointy headed logic, malicious miners. Perfect sense.

Umm what? Yes you can

I don't know enough to take a side in the scaling issue, but you sound stupid and aren't winning anyone over to your view.
