@_date: 2017-12-28 05:21:43
Dude i bet he killed his self for selling too early lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:25:23
I don't post to often but just saying this explains it perfectly first dip nuts second dip throw you off it was what I will forever refer to the day of slaughtering because Bitcoin straight destroyed people
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:48:44
But you are correct about fees
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:44:35
It already does  we are just spread out
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:14:37

@_date: 2019-03-19 18:51:32
I agree with the following comments Bitcoin is issued by blocks and miners
@_date: 2019-03-30 17:11:34
Every Bitcoin transaction is stored on every computer that has a node or enough space globally so technically if one computer has the ledger it's able to run in a sense not that it wouldn't be a pain in the ass of course
@_date: 2019-03-05 13:34:55
They need to add the Satoshi symbol to Google keyboard can't believe Google had the balls too go Apple first on this ��
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:11:32
I don't understand why mine and sold instead of mine and hodl accumulation in preparation of the next big run you could end up paying that electricity bill 5x over if the individual had money to cover cost during accumulation phase realistically that night be really hard for big companies but minnows with like 1-3 miners should be easily covered my most US miners I can't speak for other countries but that's what I'm doing and using nice hash to do it as probably assumed I'm not rich by any means �� but the people who accumulate now thru mining/buying  will be some of the biggest winners during next to run 
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:03:27
I mentioned this the other day some what
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:14:33
In my opinion gold has no value its a metal in a rock that's like saying any random shiny rock has value
@_date: 2019-03-05 15:18:22
That was another thing that I didn't mention mining difficulty and the consistency of allot of the fluctuation always seems to go back to that spot when I first came into Bitcoin last year it was like 3 grand and just about to start the rise I didn't expect it even know what relatively what I was doing so I wasn't around long enough to compare prior sentiment but I sternly remember that Rothschild bought Bitcoin and several deep pocketed fellows who were salty they missed out possible recreation event thru manipulations and bot programs to allow for stability and accumulation for said salty deep pocketed people
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:34:46
I did mention that it would be hard for big companies in my prior post due to these reasons unfortunately that's a roadblock to an extent at the moment to much sell not enough buy
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:01:21
The people who want money for food and water and the rich who have generators or other power supplies in this situation you assume that nobody has battery or anything? Their are ways to get around it even simple text message the system is international so all you have to do is sign the transaction (possible to do offline) and as soon as you got internet it should send to the chain 2 seconds worth of data
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:06:36
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:52:30
Hmm don't think anyone is that dumb gotta be secure before you can bother with any form of money
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:54:42
People forgot about natural power such as wind and water as well as generators and batteries in phones laptops tablets or basically any mobile device �� oh and tethering don't exist either because the power went out
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:50:25
Or laptops or tablets don't forget those ��
@_date: 2019-11-18 12:58:23
The government will just say it's another terrorist group using bitcoin watch
@_date: 2019-03-11 02:43:34
Similar situation minus the startup but for sure have learned many skills thanks to crypto
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:24:16
Man heard too many stories of hostages and stuff over BTC ��
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:08:16
Probably should but if your mining any ways fuck it ?
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:16:50
Ok Boomer, Millennial here I own my house and pay my mom's bills too were not all idiots or broke as losers
@_date: 2019-03-24 17:12:40
Link to this? I got s3 frontier and would love it
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:34:40
Follow up after reading your link that's 100% IED that's definitely terrorism
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:33:50
Yeah I'll agree that's pretty terrorist like and kinda scary
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:38:37
Second follow up after a small amount of thought that's crazy as hell and I also no longer side with the protestors this is way out of line thanks for showing me that I honestly appreciate it a crap ton because I was mostly ignorant to them doing things like that I mean I knew their was some harsh things but that's a straight up shrapnel bomb propane tanks are semi resistant without a detonator but if they are smart enough to make basically a grenade like this their almost guaranteed to be a detonator in place and that's absolutely terrifying
@_date: 2019-11-18 19:12:30
Hmm interesting and quite possible as their is several that very much do exist
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:47:10
And they did buy some look up George Soros and the Rockefellers
@_date: 2019-08-30 00:27:09
By that logic no wallet is safe which I would agree with but also nobody really wants to code their own wallet I would think I know I don't and I would be willing to bet I'm already in some government archives some place lol
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:15:59
I got it for 600 plus 150$ credit which I used on VR headset (traded in s9)
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:46:38
They know it's not possible to shut down buttcoin entirely
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:33:44
Don't spend it until you're 18 and you'll be able to get whatever
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:08:12
Recommendations on a wallet to try with?
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:41:59
It also has a second layer added to it with Knox supposedly
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:46:23
It's blocked away entirely separate from the system and second layer security of Knox no wallet on the planet is safe 100%
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:45:07
I'm not sure honestly I wanna say yes but I could be wrong they do give you a mnemonic phrase but who knows if it's useable anywhere except compatible Samsung devices
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:37:59
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:00:47
Just wanna specifically say I don't recommend going third party it opens you to a world of bad things
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:46:16
I thought Europe already had it or even had it first? ������
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:57:36
I would agree with you honestly it's the only way I would consider safe
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:58:09
Woot! Can't wait too see some in Dayton Ohio or Huber heights things with crypto seem to be picking up and alot of people would love a way to get in easier especially my self �� good luck to yah guys!
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:44:35
I think that's already started and the biggest actions have only just begun yet I'm not worried honestly �� they are taking an approach that it isn't stoppable by them so regulate the hell out of it eventually their will be war for Bitcoin instead of oil lololol
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:50:28
Of course not because it's a threat to their current money scam
@_date: 2019-08-30 00:25:16
They say it's separate from the OS I guess I'm not an expert though you also get a recovery phrase as well
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:53:09
I've heard horror stories about this but who knows
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:59:17
Super weird I guess maybe they don't have it in Europe you could try downloading the apk 3rd party but I wouldn't recommend it honestly that opens you up to a world of bad stuff
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:32:01
Not the play store Samsung store (galaxy store)
@_date: 2019-10-04 13:57:15
Still nice even if it ain't lambo
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:45:07
Lol na less I'm broke very broke actually
@_date: 2019-10-18 02:43:27
Bro they make bank lol it's crazy source: I knew a guy
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:29:17
I believe so all s10 and note 10 variants should support this
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:46:01
That's a shame honestly I bet theirs a way to enable it thru 3rd party Download of the app ofc I would be real careful going that route
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:53:52
I wish there was more Bitcoin ATMs
Edit: Thanks for the catch
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:07:37
It gives you a mnemonic phrase though I haven't tried it with another app though yet
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:26:20
It's in Samsung app store you need keystore and the app for it to work right
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:39:39
Bitcoin was added in the newest update so make sure you get the most up-to-date version Samsung has added if you go some unofficially sponsored method outside of Samsung Galaxy store
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:33:53
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:20:12
Come for the revolution stay for the lambos
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:18:45
Something like 64-65% of currently active BTC haven't moved in a year or more
@_date: 2019-12-28 16:50:07
Lol I love this duck video �� but it for sure applies to alot
@_date: 2019-12-09 23:45:26
So what your saying is your average American is quite wealthy in Venezuela?
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:34:15
You should confirm validity for us
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:57:36
Surprised as well I honestly figured the majority of us noticed the bull shit and it was in part why were here
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:23:46
Freedom doesn't exist or guddafi would still be alive
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:00:41
Lol nice I didn't notice right off hand though I'm gonna say bottom won't be hit till about 3-5k
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:24:47
Thanks for that info that's amazing man!
@_date: 2019-09-28 12:43:42
Probably lol but gold and oil are down now also I believe your probably correct about intergalactic currency "credits" is what I'm voting for lolol
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:55:42
I know right they fail to mention most farms are running wind solar and hydro power
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:53:14
You obviously don't analyze either what are you the great educator now
@_date: 2019-09-26 20:29:44
I had some guy try and fight with me about how Bitcoin is a waste cuz it's going down I was like 20k -&gt; 3K seen much worse ��
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:14:54
@_date: 2019-09-25 22:48:25
Fiat is the bigger scam we'll go the old fashioned way of picking between shiniest of two turds
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:42:15
Lolol not sure what you would expect this is a small dump compared to 20 down to 3k buy the dip and shut up you know you ain't done and your just mad cuz you bought the top
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:51:41
Really 0.3 BTC a month? That could be super affordable now but do you adjust for up and downs because that could be scary expensive
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:59:04
If lose it all today I've made more than I would have lost in not worried about it faith is in the software that I've seen my self and much more useable for me than Fiat that's getting printed by the 100billions weekly at this point the enjoyment and money I've made is way better but the US market is on the verge of recession i tried stocks and in one day after Trump started the trade war I lost more than my total in 3 years on BTC
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:56:01
More than likely especially if they have KYC I was thinking more for p2p rather I guess
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:53:54
Why not buy both and hedge ?
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:36:05
I couldn't help but laugh really hard at all tha people that lost out big because they are dumb
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:07:43
That's true so at least a small form of protection if you move it to a private wallet quickly I guess
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:33:39
This is dope ������ can I get your blue prints for that setup?
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:54:45
Money in any form is only as valuable as we make it diamonds and gold only metal and rocks to me nothing tangible their
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:44:12
Second I'm curious 1 how nobody heard about this main stream wise but also the reaction of the people and the affect it had on them hope you're okay now BTW ��!
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:10:45
I hope it does but at the same time I don't lolol �� I would love a good buy spot but hate to loose value
@_date: 2019-09-25 21:31:25
My a single person on the planet can predict Bitcoin with 100% accuracy but considering we went 3k to 10k a retreat was well over due and it may go lower before bouncing around and then eventually going back up but thanks
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:02:47
That bad?
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:24:18
Haven't looked into them honestly I kinda like hashflare because their interface and usability
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:07:57
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:29:25
Proud hodlr here people was tripping selling going nuts and we still was right
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:14:28
I've read that it's good for network I'm not really in it for the money so even the tiny bit that might come out of it I'm not concerned about I'm even looking into making a small mining pool with a few friends
