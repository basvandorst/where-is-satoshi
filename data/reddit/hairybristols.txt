Deliberately misleading, and his response is one of delay. Untrustworthy person.

Wow, these scammers are still going? I managed to get £1500 back of £3000, but then gave up after months of trying. I believe they also rebranded to a new name, I looked the owner up on Twitter, all his followers paid for, and the guy looks like a serial killer!
How this guy is not in prison is beyond me.

I think some point next year, although there will probably be a sudden rise and quick fall before the year is out as many people seem to expect that the price will take off again like last year.

Trouble just seems to follow this guy around. The Aussie tax office, then the unconvincing, 'i'm Satoshi' watch me try and fool you with a trick and pony show display, and now this...

Am i reading this wrong, or has someone just spent 753 million on bitcoin? If so that has to be a corporation, and a big one if so...

I was going to do this two years ago in the UK, kind of wish i did, but at the same i've done well trading crypto online, especially bitcoin, so i can't complain.
I was going to buy I think Gemini machines, which were easy to use and affordable, i estimated, at that time i would make £8k per machine every year, hardest part was placing the machines in the right place on a good deal which i did some research in to. The part i never finished was the running and maintenance of the machines, refilling and collecting and such, whether i would do this myself, hire someone, or get the owner of the shop trained up to be able to do it, how did you sort this in the end? Especially considering the trust element with someone else handling the cash.
Wish you all the success mate, hope your machines are listed on coinATM-radar i think it was called.

The only thing i'm sure of about CSW is that he's a compulsive liar. There is an interview around where his mother says he has always been like this since childhood telling tall stories etc.
