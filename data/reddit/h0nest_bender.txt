The dorm rooms are already limited. There are already circuit breakers in place. If the school feels that students are using more power than they should, they just have to change the existing fuses.  
  
Fairly quick and cheap.  
I guarantee any university with housing employs someone capable of replacing fuses.

There's a very simple solution to this and one that is likely in place already. Circuit breakers. You only wire up the dorms to supply a certain amount of amps. Problem solved.

Currency is digital. The financial and banking industries run on mountains of power-sucking computers, same as bitcoin.

A number of exchanges recently changed the wording on their sites from Bitcoin Cash to BCash in an attempt to avoid confusion for their users. Some people in this community feel that Roger Ver intentionally fosters that confusion and so they also refer to Bitcoin Cash as BCash.

People didn't have their bitcoin wrapped up in nicehash anymore than you have your income wrapped up in your employers payroll. Work was done for nicehash which will not be paid for because nicehash had their payroll for the week stolen.  
  


  
Actually, you attached a condition to that, which suggests you *do* think a subset of people deserved it.  
  


  
It's a false equivalency. Nicehash was stolen from and because nicehash was robbed, they can't make good on their debts. That's not an analogous situation to storing your bitcoin with a third party.  
  


  
It's not a vulnerability with bitcoin. The risk of not getting paid by your employer has existed for as long as there have been employers. And I fail to see how that would be the fault of the employee.

They only pay out at certain thresholds and depending on how *much* you mine, you might only get paid out once a week.  
  
Until you've mined .001 or .01 BTC (depends on how you set up your account), the accumulated coin sits with Nicehash.  
  
I doubt anyone was storing their BTC on Nicehash in lieu of a wallet.

I'm playing cordial on the off chance that you actually wanted to have a civil discussion. I can see I wasted my time with you, now. Sling whatever ignorant insults you want, you're ignored now.

I mean, I can check the recent blocks and see how much it costs to get at transaction published... It's really easy. And you don't know anything about what I think. Why do you feel the need to talk down to me like an asshole?

If privacy is your concern, there are much better coins than Bitcoin *or* BCH.
