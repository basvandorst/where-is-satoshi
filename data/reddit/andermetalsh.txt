True. I am an European, so I know pretty well my shit, my History and OFC more about social movements than a recently founded country with no experience on learning across the history on goverments, revolts and social behaviour on politics, social needs or how politics truly work.
Here we had invasions from a lot of countries, 5 separate kingdoms fighting inside and outside, democratic republiques, anarchist people being killed from the previos social-democrat republique goverments,  fascist right-wing regimes who helped Hitler, and sucessfull non-violent anarchist bindings (with companies being ran on anarco-socialistic principles), among two separtist left-wing armies.
If the CNN is Marxist then Spain is an anarchist anti-state.

Do not EVER transfer your valuable data over the "cloud". Backup locally to a realiable storage. More than once.

Get a simple distro like Lubuntu or Fedora 19 XFCE. It's safer and pretty easy to use.

"Your "cheap" healthcare is pitched on your debts and your dying currency. 
Are you talking about Europe, or the USA with its debt to China?
A free market without all the regulations ALWAYS results in more efficient businesses and cheaper services."
I am not from the USA, stop posting bullshit, please. Maybe it will more efficient for the CEO's WALLET  while half of your people is either dying of cancer, starving and adquiring state bonifications to have something to eat or becoming homeless because they can't pay a trivial operation which in Europe can be payed thanks to the taxes.
**EDIT : 
That's it, a big chunk of YOUR people has the same living quality as an near isolated Mexico village.

"In an anti-tax based system, projects and development will become competative because you are no longer guaranteed payment by state"
And that's how British health system went down thanks to private business.
Sorry, but in those cases, HEALTH is always before money. Period.

Even with that, we have a lower criminality rate than the US.

Just change the perspective with gimp.

". Did you know that in the US we pay 24% of all our taxes to medical??"
Well, you got a fucking bad healthcare even if you pay those taxes. The problem is not he healthcare, it's your healthcare.
US social welfare sucks. At least in Europe we are pretty much advanced.
You could be the most powerful economy in the world, but if your products are so shitty, you are actually paying more because your goods and suchs... are a shit.
Just look at Europe.
· Awesome healthcare, and much cheaper than the US one.
· Better food. No doubt here. Thousands of gastronomic culture gave us a good taste with ridiculously cheap prices.
· Better health. Fucking obesity is everywhere on the US thanks to well, a bad alimentation.
· Good climate and cheap public transportation. 
· Low crime rate. Well, if you do not allow having guns to everyone, maybe the chances of a robber killing you with a bullet will lower severely. Also, no fucking "Columbine" like massacres or such.
In conclusion, you are richer than us but your "goods" are more shittier than ours.
PD: There is private health industry here in Spain, but they are known to fucking work for money instead of YOUR health, and if your ache is not profitable you are fucked up. They found a lot of legal "scams".
Sorry for my English.

Setting up /home (Somehing like C:\users on Windows) as a separated encrypted folder helps. Also, run the Bitcoin client under a complete isolated user account. No web, no internet, nothing, just BTC's.
Finally, set /home/yourbitocinuser permissions as 0700, (read, write and execute permissions for the folder owner(your btc user) , no perms at all for your "normal" and everyday Ubuntu account and others.

Nope. Because here is uber-difficult to get a gun. The most common weapon used by robbers is a knife.

We are not taking about availability. I mean the "cloud" server could became out of business and so sending your wallet to the thrash.
