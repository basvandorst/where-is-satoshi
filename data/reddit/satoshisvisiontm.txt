You are not looking at the long-term value of bitcoin. With increased adoption, will come decreased volatility. 
Assume for a moment that you are a merchant in 2009 that is willing to risk some of its income to volatility, and that this service was supplied by Satoshi. You would have become filthy rich if just a small amount of people were using it.

Yup, and the genesis block's 50BTC aren't the only reductions that will ensure we won't reach the 21m limit. There were multiple blocks that didn't claim their coinbase reward, which further reduces the total number of bitcoin that will be mined. For example: [block 501726]( doesn't claim its 12.5 reward, and [block 526591]( only claims half.
This is different from sending to a burn address, making the coins provably unspendable; these are coins that never existed.

Either way, the description of the recent past does show that average value of bitcoin in the relatively-short term (50d) is in an upward trajectory steeper than that of the medium-long term (200d). Regardless of what predictions you can make based on this information, it is still a bullish sign.

Correct. The coinbase transaction in the genesis block served as the "entry point" for the blockchain in the 0.1 client, but the utxo was not added to the list of utxo's. It's not entirely clear why Satoshi did this, but it means the first coinbase transaction could not be spent. When the code of the client was changed later by other users, they chose not to add the utxo to the list of utxo's, because that would give Satoshi the ability to perform a chainsplit (since older clients would not accept a transaction with that utxo if he spent it).
Donations to the coinbase address \*are\* in the list of utxo's though, and can be freely spent, so long as you have the private key of the genesis block.

Since your post on r/btc blew up and got swarmed by BCH proponents, I'm going to take the time to answer your questions in what I hope is a civil, unbiased way, since the only reply you got here was by bashCo, who is a moderator. I'm going to start by denoting the differences between BCH and BTC, because this is integral to my opinion about the Bitcoin,com wallet. Note that I wrote "my opinion", since that is really all I can give; an opinion.
**The Differences between BTC and BCH.**
Bitcoin Cash forked off from Bitcoin on August 1st 2017, in response to the approaching activation of SegWit. SegWit, which is a modification to the bitcoin source code that will allow transactions to move parts of their data into a new data structure, allows for more transactions to be placed in the 1Mb block size. There was a fierce debate at that time between proponents of different scaling solutions for Bitcoin, which can generally be put into two camps: Small Blockers, and Big Blockers.
Small Blockers argued as such: the key value proposition of Bitcoin is that it is a decentralized digital currency. It is decentralized because anyone with a computer and a stable internet connection can install the bitcoin client (a *full node*), and validate the network. You can check your own balance, the state of the network, and if everyone is working with the same rules as you do.
Increasing the block size add to a centralizing force in the network: the requirements for running a full node. Bigger blocks means bigger hard drives, but more importantly, a better internet connection. Bandwidth is the limiting factor, since blocks are propagated by every full node to all its connected nodes that have not received that block yet.
Increasing the block size is a means to an end, which is increasing the maximum number of transactions in a block. Small blockers proposed optimizing the use of block space before increasing block sizes. If I recall correctly, the allegory was a truck loaded with boxes; small blockers wanted to organize the boxes better so more would fit, big blockers wanted a second truck to throw their boxes in.
Big Blockers argued that the block size limit was put in place as a protection against poison blocks, and that Moore's law still holds, so running a full node should still be possible, since it had been more than a year since the block size was added. Strictly speaking, they are correct, but Small Blockers argued that would not negate the increased requirements, and that there are many people in the world that can't run a full node because they can't fulfill those requirements. Big Blockers were unimpressed by this argument, and put forth that running a light client (not a full node, but one pointed at a trusted full node that does validation for you) is enough, and that enough people are still running full nodes.
Eventually, the split happened, and both groups generally went their own way. Enter Roger Ver: very much a Big Blocker, and the owner of Bitcoin,com. Formerly known as "Bitcoin Jesus", he was one of the vocal evangelists of Bitcoin in the early days, but went all-in on Bitcoin Cash. Ver is... sketchy. He once set up a business that sent fireworks over the mail, which is a felony in the USA, and (rightly imho) got convicted for this. 
Ver changed his bitcoin website and app to be primarily about Bitcoin Cash, but also continued support for bitcoin. He did something that was unforgivable to many, including me; he branded Bitcoin Cash as "Bitcoin", and branded bitcoin as "Bitcoin BTC". Imagine a newby downloading that appears to be the official bitcoin app, and buying "Bitcoin". Now imagine trying to spend those coins and finding out you lost your money because you never actually bought what the rest of the world considers to be bitcoin...
Regardless of the ethical question of "what is bitcoin?", and "should "Bitcoin Cash" use the name Bitcoin?", it is morally wrong to deliberately mislead your audience in a way that they buy a product you benefit off.
**Is Bitcoin,com a scam?**
My opinion is pretty clear. Bitcoin,com is a wallet and a website that has repeatedly and willfully misled people about that is bitcoin and what is bitcoin cash to the betterment of its owner. I would never use their services, and actively advise people not to use their site because at any point in time they might change it back to the misleading version. If you think nobody will be misled: check out twitter and reddit; there are numerous people complaining about it in threads and tweets.
The "Great Scaling Debate" essentially boils down to two groups of people having different options about the way Bitcoin can become a revolutionary force of good in our world. Big Blockers believe in scaling immediately and rapidly regardless of its centralizing force, believing merchant adoption will bring consumer adoption. Small Blockers believe in sound money theory, and that a limited block space will take bitcoin from a collectors item to a Store of Value, from which it can become a Medium of Exchange and a Unit of Account. Check out this podcast by [Antony Pompliano with Murad Mahmudov]( It gives a great introduction into this idea.
**Bitcoin,com stealing your funds**
I don't recall ever seeing anyone outright claiming this. There might have been a time when there was concern about the wallet sharing your private key, but as far as I know, this was debunked or at least no longer an issue. I also believe that they at one point suffered from a hack that was in software they used as a framework for their wallet, but that wasn't them deliberately taking your funds.
I would like to again point out that their service repeatedly and deliberately sold BCH as "Bitcoin", claiming that it was so because BCH was closer to the whitepaper than BTC. They also repeatedly called "Bitcoin" "Bitcoin Core", which is also a misrepresentation.
**Parting words**
Note that the value of Bitcoin Cash set out against Bitcoin has fallen greatly. Note that usage of BCH is minimal, and that it does not carry consensus about being Bitcoin. Note that the philosophy of bigger blocks has been widely attacked. Note that increasing the block size is still possible for Bitcoin, but people don't want that currently.

To be honest, it would be far more interesting if you left the private keys in reddit comments or other social media. Imagine the stir if people found out someone is leaving private keys containing varying amounts of bitcoin on them. 
This has the benefit of not geographically locking out most of the world population, increasing exposure (as the media platform people use to talk about it are the ones where the addresses can be found at), and giving you the option of not having to show where you live.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:52:01
To my knowledge: Liquid is a side-chain that works with different properties because of a different network architecture. This allows for faster consensus, and is mainly catered to whales and exchanges that can rapidly move large sums of cryptocurrency between each other. With tether (the goto stablecoin at the moment) added, this allows people to move value rapidly between exchanges and make use of arbitrage (differences in price for the same product between exchanges).

@_date: 2018-09-21 13:34:36
As far as I know, running an older version of the software that still follows the current consensus rules isn't detrimental to the network. Your node might process transactions a bit slower, or might not understand the SegWit address structure, but that doesn't hinder the network. You can turn nodes off, update the code, and turn it back on. It will sync with the blockchain and the mempool to get the current known info, then resume work as usual.
If your node no longer follows consensus rules, you might eventually find yourself on a dead chain, or on a minority chain that is actually mined. That last category doesn't exist to my knowledge, but might happen if a sufficiently large part of the hash rate hasn't upgraded and a malicious actor forces a block through that is invalid under the new code, but not under the old. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 09:38:56
The only way bitcoin will ever die is by losing either its decentralization, or through successful double spends. Both are fundamental reasons for its existence, and either of them broken will render it a failed experiment. 
Lack of interest will reduce hash power, which is directly related to the ability to do double spends.

Every bit (pun intended) of padding on transactions will have to be downloaded in the future for complete chain validation.

Or he is just a rational thinker that doesn't agree with you. Why are you dragging Theymos into this? The UASF movement gaining traction with 18% of the nodes signalling it was indeed what forced the miners to consent with segwit. If they hadn't, they would have risked a far more dangerous network split, potentially leading to them mining on an abandoned chain. It would have hurt everyone, and so the miners were corrected by the users to do the right thing.
Oh, and before you start about a minority group of Bitcoin users forcing their way, note that the number of miners that blocking SegWit was considerably smaller than the number of Bitcoin users fighting back with UASF.

**Public**: actor known, action known.
**Private**: actor known, action unknown.
**Anonymous**: actor unknown, action known.
**Pseudononymous**: actor unknown, but can supply proof of existence, action known.
Bitcoin is more pseudononymous than anonymous. Once you send money to someone, they known you were, at that time, the owner of the keys that belonged to that address. You can become public if you sent money from an exchange directly to that address, and the exchange supplies your KYC/AML data. 
Bitcoin is not private because as of now, it is impossible to hide the payment from others. 2nd layer tech should solve that.
It is worth noting that adding privacy to the base layer is not something trivial. It would mean that it is no longer provably true that at most 21M bitcoin will circulate, since you can then hide the value transacted (or the transaction itself).

There is no competition. You only have Bitcoin and altcoins, and altcoins are mostly scamcoins.
There is a small amount of coins that offer things that Bitcoin won't be able to offer in the future via soft-forks, but those are very rare, and often built on technology that is unproven and/or untested. Nano's feeless transaction system is one, but that is mostly untested against big attacks.
In the end, all altcoins make concessions in security, decentralization, or distribution.

The real question will be if he will pay 1 BCH, or the current value of 1 BCH spread out over 12 months. Because the way BCH is going, he's probably going to actually pay half of the current value of 1 BCH.

You are asking about a block size increase. Whether it is related it LN or not is irrelevant, because block size increases are currently not high on the agenda while other options are available. Once all other options have fallen away, a block size increase becomes relevant. The game theory behind is is relevant, because it is why block size increases are low on the agenda.
Also, the 130Mb block size target is, to the best of my knowledge, an informed guestimate. We have absolutely no idea about what bitcoin's usage is going to be in 50, 25, or even 10 years. I don't need to go near that topic, because that topic is not relevant as long as we are still able to increase the  figure.

Not sure if you are being sarcastic here, so I'm going to give you a small real-world example:
You want to buy a house, but there's a 3 month delay before you can actually move in and own it. You and the selling party agree upon a third party (lawyer, notary, HS janitor, whatever), and write the money to a 2-of-3 multisig wallet. Time passes, and when all is ready for the actual move, you can transfer the money together (3rd party only needed if problems arise).

Nor do you need to. Bitcoin's version number is 0.19, which means that it hasn't been considered production-ready for mass adoption yet. Note that GMail has been used in beta for years by half the world before it went out of beta.
[Taproot]( is a combination of Schnorr signature aggregation (smaller multisig transactions), MAST (smaller scripted transactions) and Taproot itself (more anonymous complex script transactions). It is most likely going to be the next massive upgrade to the bitcoin protocol.
It will also allow easier onboarding on the Lightning Network through channel factories.
@_date: 2018-10-31 07:32:29


They are still being talked about. You just have to consider all the facts and join the right channels. If you start a serious conversation in the bitcoin slack or on github about bigger blocks that is not rehashing the same arguments that have been discussed repeatedly over the past years, you will not be banned, but engaged. Note however, that this is a topic that has been polarizing the community for a long while now, mostly because the scaling debate is being abused by certain actors in their personal best interest. You will need to provide new insights or powerful new arguments to make rehashing this debate worth everyone's time.


Last time bitcoin was in a bubble, the fees did indeed rise. This was due to a combination of several factors, of which the most notable were:
1. Coinbase not batching their transactions, and overpaying fees.
2. Wallet software fee estimation was malfunctioning. The fees required for inclusion in blocks was way overestimated, and this caused a further rise in fees. 
3. SegWit was not yet integrated in most exchanges, again most notably at CoinBase.
4. The bitcoin chain was being attacked with a spam attack meant to also raise the fees.
The question is if $100 fees will return if bitcoin hyperappreciates to $50 000. Can you be sure that $100 fees will return? I transacted during the top of the bull market, when the mempool was at its peak. 4sat/byte was enough to transact with and get included in one of the next 6 blocks. Only use cases that require immediate confirmation need to venture into the &gt;50 sat/byte range IMHO.
Also note that there is a lot of FUD going around about the LN. For instance, the "you need 2 transactions for each channel" argument is provably false. You can start a new channel when you close an old one. You will eventually be able to use a channel factory that [can open multiple channels at the same time]( 


This seems moderately correct, but also note that Bitcoin is primarily being used as a Store of Value at the moment. Becoming a Medium of Exchange  requires an initial period of accumulating value. Eventually, it will become a Unit of Account, at which point it is globally accepted (in Bitcoin's case). You can't function as a medium of exchange reliably if the value still wildly fluctuates. This is the reason why Steam stopped accepting Bitcoin; it was too difficult to arbitrage returns of purchases with 5% value swings. 


Incorrect. The community is forbidding itself from rehashing the same old arguments over and over. If you have new insights, arguments, or opinions they will be heard and engaged.  The problem is that most people don't have new insights, arguments, or opinions, but still want to be heard, even though some amount of research would have shown them that they aren't bringing anything new to the table. 
I feel that you are hinting at the strict moderation at r/bitcoin about this, since that is the most notable place where threads about big blocks get consistently removed. Note that r/bitcoin is not the only place where bitcoin is discussed.
@_date: 2018-10-30 09:36:32
The discussion about block sizes has been active for the past 5-7 years, all the way back to Satoshi. It is still active today, but consensus currently states that a blocksize increase is not beneficial yet. 
The introduction of Segwit effectively gave us 2Mb blocks. The introduction of LN will shave away smaller transactions that don't require instant settlement, reducing required blockspace.  Schnorr and BLS signatures will further reduce required blockspace. MAST will reduce required blockspace. 
All of these solutions are opt-in, are backwards compatible, are effective increases of the number-of-transactions-per-block, and come without cost. 
Block size increases do come at a cost; the number of full nodes will be reduced. All full nodes, including *hobby* nodes running on Raspberry Pies, increase the [impenetrable fortress of verification]( that is bitcoin. Miners are only special in that they provide a timestamping service, for which they are rewarded in fees and coinbase rewards.
Claiming that *no one* is talking about bigger blocks shows that you don't understand the current consensus about scaling bitcoin, which focusses on solutions that don't increase the operational cost of running a bitcoin node. You could have found all of this out by following and searching the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the various bitcoin fora, and even r/btc, biased as it is.
For bitcoin to grow using blocksize increases, you would eventually need Terrabyte blocks, or even larger. Note that Bitcoin as it exists today can only process the transactions of a single medium-large city in the USA. Gigabyte blocks would not even scale bitcoin to complete adoption in the USA if I recall correctly, and that is assuming bandwidth and latency will allow for instant transmission of blocks. 
Also; it would not solve the incentive that users currently lack to consolidate their UTXO's. If that pool keeps growing larger, then [the UTXO pool will grow to unmanageable size](

No, LN is never sold as the only scaling option, but it is the only one where the core attributes of Bitcoin are preserved: decentralised censorship-proof money. 
Other scaling options are schnorr signatures and MAST. 


It works, but ups the cost of running a full node over time.

Nah, banning would be their last option, since their narrative is that r/bitcoin is censoring through bannings. If they did the same, that would amount to shooting themselves in the foot.
Instead, they heavily downvote everything that dissents. This means anyone that opposes their worldview get negative karma in their sub, triggering Reddit's rate limiter. 
They always reply, often with a question. Because you get downvoted, and they asked a question, to an outsider it appears like you can't answer their questions. 
They used to couple this with having multiple accounts asking questions, forcing you to have to wait 10 minutes every time, and splitting your time over multiple reply-threads.

It's not a hard problem that requires you to sacrifice in your *lebenfreude*, it's just to make life easier for everyone else. Something even subtler happens with inches and feet; the US uses a different measurement system, and so it is at the very least courteous to acknowledge this and note the same value in metric: 6'5" (1m96).

Around 3:20 one of the participants asks what's to stop people in the future from printing another 21 million btc. Your answer is that they'd have to convince 51% of the miners to agree upon that to pull this off.
This is incorrect. You don't just need the miners, you need the economic majority of bitcoin's users. If 51% of the miners fork off with bigger rewards, and the economic majority of bitcoin's users remains with the original chain, then those miners will waste resources mining a dead/dying chain. They will eventually return to the chain that holds the economic supermajority.
A good example of this is BCH. BCH forked off before SegWit to support bigger blocks. Because they didn't have an economic majority, their chain fell into disuse, and the value of 1 BCH has bled out to about 0.03 BTC at the moment, and is still falling.
Miners perform a specific task; timestamping transactions. They get rewarded for it, but that is about as far as their influence over the network spreads. Miners thinking they are more important tend to lose a lot of money.

Not dude, but I'll try. The main problem with tipping is in regards to fees. When you receive a tip for say, 10c, that tip would need to be transferred to an address in your control. Doing so on a blockchain needlessly clutters the place. Instead, you want a system that will allow you to do trustless microtransactions in which only the final balance is written to the blockchain, if ever. The lightning network is one possibility, which works as a second layer. 
Reddit might also create a separate, third layer system on top of the Lightning Network for this. I expect netflix might experiment with this; using pay-per-second business models.

The lightning network consists of a set of channels between people.

You do need to keep your node online, or trust another party to do that for you, if you don't want to do that.

This is basically the crux with Bitcoin Cash. Bitmain acted like there was big support for larger blocks through miner signalling. Not only are miners a subset of the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, they also have different incentives. To them (and especially mining pool operators), increasing the blocksize is beneficial, as this raises the cost of running a full node, which reduces the competition. BitMain had hoped to be able to force through consensus with SegWit2X, but instead found that economic users rightly threatened to take their business elsewhere. Instead of taking the hint, they doubled down on their own stupidity and thought that their hash power would be enough to convince people to use BCH.

There an assumed lost amount of Bitcoin in the range of 3.5 Million BTC, so that brings it down to 1 in 17.5million. Then, there's about 100 adresses that own a cummulative amount of about 3 million BTC. Considering that there will be some overlap, we could say 1 in 15 million. If we counted all addresses with +1 Bitcoin, we could wind that down to a ballpark estimate of about 5-7 million.

That said; the news that Binance was hacked can still be fud, since no evidence is present to show that the KYC info that has been dropped wasn't from the 2018 hack, and binance might want to offer a bounty to find the data hacker regardless of whether the hack was done today or 12 months ago.

The year is 2020. The day after valentine's day 2019, Bitcoin Cash suddenly surged in adoption. People around the world eagerly began using the Bitcoin fork, leading to a rapid and controlled influx of users. Because of the Lindy effect, those users began transacting more and more amongst each other. Soon, the 32Mb blocks began to fill up. The block size was increased several times to accompany the exponentially growing userbase.
Those bigger blocks began weighing the network down, regardless of changes rapidly implemented, such as CTOR and the like. Propagation of blocks and transactions began limiting the use of non-mining full nodes, which had been deemed non-essential to the network long ago. Mounting costs in bandwidth, storage, and IO operations slowly forced out the smaller players, leaving only the mining pool operators.
On December 31st, a man seated in a big office in China starts a conference call. One by one, the video feeds of each of the other mining pool operators goes online. When the last of them turns on, he rises, picking up his glass of Champagne. 
"Competitors. Colleagues. *Friends.*",  he states, "Let us toast to the success of Bitcoin Cash. We have weathered the storm. We are the last of the Mohicans. We are the cream of the crop. The brightest. The greediest. The ruthless."
Glasses are raised in salute. Everyone takes a polite sip.
"Now that we are entrusted with the care of the network, I wish to discuss something with you. Ever since the halvening, we've been struggling to keep our businessmodel from collapsing. The influx of new users is too great to keep our expenses covered. My company would like to propose a gentlemen's agreement. Let's stop including transactions with a fee of less than 5 sat/byte in our blocks..."

Nobody owns those keys until quantum attacks or a vulnerability is found that allows people to find them. Because Satoshi mostly mined in 2009, he probably used separate private keys for each transaction, so you would need to attack each utxo for its private key. There is no single key in this regard.

This is not true, since bitcoin has no last block, only a latest block. I think you meant to say: Bitcoin has a finite number of blocks that are subsidized by a coinbase reward.  
I really doubt if the single satoshi you get for mining in 2139 in going to make a difference in regards to mining without a coinbase reward in 2140. 
Bitcoin halvened from 50 to 25, and the network survived.   
Bitcoin halvened from 25 to 12.5, and the network survived.  
Bitcoin will halven from 12.5 to 6.25. It will most likely survive.
Every time bitcoin halvens, the confidence that it will survive the next halvening will rise, because the difference between the rewards is less in absolute terms, and the revenue in fees is bigger in relative (and hopefully absolute) terms.

It doesn't. But it does double the effect of block propagation issues and connectedness in the network. If your mining farms are connected with very high speed internet, you have an advantage over others that might have an average of 100ms delay. That is a very conservative estimate.  100ms = 0,1 sec = 1/6.000th of the time between to blocks on average. That doubles in 5 minute blocks. There are also other factors like AsicBoost to consider.

I think both Trezor and Ledger have products that do what they need to do (minimize risk of coin loss due to software/hardware failure), but come with a new risk (vendor attack, seed loss). 
If the hardware breaks or is lost, you just order a new one. While installing, you wrote down your seed phrase and put it somewhere safe. This is the moment where you take it out, and while installing dictate the seed. Presto; the coins are back.
You can also do this with a software wallet, if you can't wait for the HW wallet to ship.

There will never be 21 million bitcoin. If you consider bitcoin to exist if they are in a UTXO in the UTXO pool, then satoshi's 50 coins from the genesis block don't count (as u/exab rightly points out). 
Even disregarding those coins, there are more coins that never were.. [On multiple occasions, miners failed to mine the correct mining reward.]( Blocks have been mined with a coinbase transaction of 0 BTC and of 6.25 BTC, where 12.5 was allowed. Another block didn't claim any fees, permanently destroying (not burning) \~1.7 BTC  Further, there were two blocks that spent the same amount to the same address with the same extra nonce. Those transactions are duplicates, and aren't in the chain.
As of block 600,000, there were 3.723039 BTC sent to OP\_RETURN outputs, making them unspendable forever, and not part of Bitcoin’s supply. [More info here](

You mitigate the attack vector of vendors by forcing both vendors to act together; they can't do it alone any more. This is why multisig (which doesn't have an inherent security risk) is useful here.
If I hand out free USB cords at a bitcoin congress with a spiffy BTC logo on it, people will take it home. I can load a small program on the cord that can compromise your HW wallet.
Using HW indeed comes with the responsibility of using it correctly. This is the reason why I've already had numerous conversations with the ledger team about the Ledger Live app, which doesn't show a changelog or appimage hash before updating itself.

Note that a single hardware wallet is considered much more secure than leaving stuff on exchanges, but isn't ideal. Your hardware wallet connects to a node controlled by Ledger, and if their firmware is hacked and finds its way to your device, you could lose funds.
For maximum security, and protection against vendor attacks, you could set up a multisignature system with two hardware wallets from different vendors and a software installation of something like Bitcoin Core, Electrum, or Wasabi.

First off, thanks for taking the time to write this extended reply!


Agreed, but regardless of anything that happens, you do still retain possession of the bitcoin you control the private keys of. The network doesn't care that your part of the world is in shambles, nor does in require your attention. Your funds are safely hashed away in the blockchain for future use. 
That said, you would indeed find yourself without anything to barter with (except if you hand over possession of your actual keys) and would be at a disadvantage, but that merely implies that you shouldn't put everything you own into bitcoin, but should spread out your holdings over multiple assets, including those you could use in a situation such as you describe. This is not an inherent failure of Bitcoin, but one of asset class availability. Stocks and bonds won't be traded either, since those are all digital too. Money in the bank becomes useless too (except that the government can seize those easily).
Note that if you were to print paper wallets, you might be able to trade those in a society used to bitcoin. The cassacius coins are a good example of this. Also note that using blockstream satellite, or mesh-networks, you could transact bitcoin even without internet.

It can still function as a money for all, if you make use of a layered system. If every layer scales bitcoin 10x, then it rapidly grows the number of transactions, and thus users, of bitcoin.
Note that what is really important is that you have the option to settle down to the base layer. If you save up a million sats and lose trust in anyone handling it for you, settling to the base layer is like putting it in a bank vault.

I'm going to assume you are talking about SegWit2x. 
This is a common retort, and it is flawed. Consensus is only reached when a clear majority of the actors involved agree upon a change. SegWit2x was an agreement made by a number of big businesses and mining operators that proposed increasing the block size to 2Mb and activating SegWit. 
They erroneously thought that they could force the consensus via the large mining pools (which were deliberately not activating SegWit because of SegWit making covert ASICBoost impossible). a significant portion of the network rebelled, and started using a client that would not follow their proposed branch, eventually gaining enough leverage that S2X was cancelled.
The compromise never had consensus, and thus was never a valid option. If it had carried consensus, it would have been accepted. Anyone that bleats about SegWit2x having been shot down by Bitcoin Core doesn't grasp the consensus model of bitcoin, and should disqualify him- or herself from further discussion until that concept is clearer.

Fees were high in december '17 because of a combination of:
1. Wallet fee estimation. This is a hard problem to get right, and many wallets were off, overshooting the fee required to get into a block by almost an order of magnitude. 
2. Exchanges were not batching their transactions, which in combination with the hype and FOMO that nearly everyone was experiencing led to a far greater number of transactions than was required.
3. A malicious entity was spamming the network, flooding it with low cost, low fee transactions. It is presumed that one or multiple of the mining pools were doing this, because they were actively pushing an agenda of bigger blocks. Since they mine their own transactions, the cost of such an attack was pretty low.
With the addition of SegWit, exchanges implementing both SegWit and transaction batching, and the attack fizzling after the failed 2x move and the fork of Bitcoin Cash, fees plummeted back down to what they normally are.
Of worth is noting that fees aren't a direct threat to the network. eventually, they will pay miners's costs, who perform a specific task in the network and should be rewarded for that task. Moving low-value, high-velocity transactions off of the blockchain and into an aggregating level 2 or 3 system like the lightning network will mean only settlements and high-value high-priority transactions are published to the blockchain.

It would be, that is the whole essence of what Udi is trying to say in his reply. Brave wanted to hand out money which they didn't have, so they went the ICO route and printed their own money. The economic incentives are misaligned, which causes BAT owners to see a gradual deflation of their coin every time Brave prints more, coupled with the inability to withdraw easily/privily.
Brave would be much better with Bitcoin, and an integration with the lightning network would really benefit both systems. I guess time will tell if their decision to go for BAT plays in their favor, or bites them in the ass in the long run.

We would need to wait until 2140'ish when the last sats have been minted. Also, we would need to fork to a version that would allow us to claim the genesis coins, which can't be spent because Satoshi for some reason didn't put them in the UTXO pool, as well as several missed coins in block and fee rewards. Oh, and there's 100 coins stuck because two miners used the same extra nonce + address + value combination. Those would need to be freed too. Oh, and we need the extra \~1 BTC not originally planned.
Then there's the problem of coins lost because the private keys are lost, or which have been burnt. We'd need to allow those coins to be moved as part of the protocol, or we'd need sufficient advances in Quantum Computing to allow us to brute-force those keys.
After that, it'll turn into a vast set of transactions, with every known UTXO sending to the same address. This will take a huge amount of transactions, enough to clog the chain for months probably. 
It will require a hard fork, global coordination, full compliance by everyone on the planet, bog down the blockchain for weeks/months/years(?), and perhaps significant advances in QC. All to buy a single immortality potion from Death, who then owns all bitcoin in existence, which will then also become instantly worthless.

A significant portion of the transactions are from VeriBlock, of which Jeff Garzik is one of the Technical Advisors. Basically, they are securing their chain by adding a transaction to the bitcoin blockchain with the hash of one of their latest blocks. It is adding many transactions to the chain by people who are hoping VeriBlock will appreciate in value.
Obviously, this will become unfeasible when bitcoin fees become higher. It needlessly clogs the system with transactions that have to be stored on people's full nodes until eternity. Did I mention Jeff Garzik is one of the Technical Advisors?
In March, Veriblock halted their testnet, and after a while switched to their mainnet. The interval between was the drop in tx's in march.

This means that each bitcoin lost by a claimant is going to be valued at $400. The 200k BTC still in mtgox's ownership is now worth far more than the total value of what is owed to claimants. This means MtGox went bankrupt, its owner got a nice vacation in jail, then stepped out of his cell as  a multibillionaire.

Good question, one that delves down to the very fundamentals of Bitcoin's value proposition.
Let's say the world's complete money supply is indeed exactly 100 Trillion. Most of that money is in banks lending out debt though, the actual amount of real, physical money is far less. Central banks can create debt, and sell it to banks, which can then use that digitally created money to fund their activities. Because central banking strives for a 2% inflation rate, this means that anyone not making a 2% increase of their funds through whatever means is losing purchasing power. Fiat is *soft money*; new money can be issued by centralized powers and its value can drop because of that.
Bitcoin has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million, which is issued at a fixed schedule. No more bitcoin will ever be created. This means that bitcoin can't inflate after its maximum supply has been issued through coinbase rewards (around the year 2140). Bitcoin is *hard money*; no central entity can issue more than the 21m maximum supply.
Let's assume that those 21 million bitcoin are in circulation right now (which will mostly be true in a decade or two anyways). If you own 1 bitcoin, you will own 1/21.000.000th of the total supply, regardless of anything that happens (save consensus-changes). Your money is hard; and if adoption keeps increasing, the value of 1 bitcoin will likewise increase. Where a loaf of bread once cost 1 BTC, it will at some point cost 0.1, 0.001, or even 1 sat. 
It doesn't matter if Bitcoin is globally accepted as *the* world reserve currency. It doesn't matter if a single entity owns 500.000 Bitcoin. What matters is that there will never be more than 21m bitcoins, and owning a stake of that supply means having the purchasing power proportional to the total value of items and services paid with Bitcoin at that time.

It is certainly not 100% certain, and you can still lose buying power when putting everything in Bitcoin if nobody else perceives it as sound money.

Every bitcoin that is not sent to a burn address will eventually become either brute-forced by an entity using a quantum computer, or will be moved by its owner to an address that is harder to crack by QC's.

Please note that Satoshi's great invention wasn't any of the individual technical pieces of Bitcoin. Proof of Work was created by Nick Szabo in 2002. Adam Back's HashCash proposal predates that.  The brilliance lay in putting each of those together to form a truly **decentralized** from of digital money.  Former incarnations of digital money, like [e-gold]( suffered from having centralized 'auction houses', where transactions needed to get 'approved'. This centralized entity could often be easily attacked.
Bitcoin's combination of hashing transactions in a novel data structure called the blockchain that broadcasts blocks peer-to-peer, and which has no centralized auction house makes bitcoin the first truly decentralized digital money. In that sense, it isn't really survivorship bias.

Basically; because it is in their own interests. BCH proponents claim on-chain scaling is possible, and that the block size should be increased. They point to Bitcoin's early history, when there was no block size cap, and claim that it is only a spam protection system that Blockstream is abusing to create a fee market.
Without the cap, and with increased adoption, running a full node will start to get more difficult. This is really a no-brainer. You need more resources like disk volume and most importantly bandwidth. Detractors of bigger blocks point out this problem, and big blockers claimed that only mining nodes actually do work, and full nodes only propagate transactions (which mining nodes also do). As such, most full nodes would not be relevant (excepting the merchants that can afford a datacenter full node).
The play here was to make miners more important. Bitcoin generally has three main types of actors working on it; miners doing PoW, developers building the code base, and users transacting and giving value. Full nodes are run by everyone, but if the cost of running one becomes prohibitive, miners will be the only ones left able to do so. In that situation, miners get to dictate the direction Bitcoin takes in future development, get to dictate the fee market, and get to decide what is included in the blockchain.
This play took serious form with the activation of SegWit. Miners were given the ability to activate it, but didn't want to do so (because it would close the door on a mining cheat (Covert ASICBoost) that would cost them money). A closed-door deal was made and miners agreed to activate SegWit if it was accompanied by a 2x block size increase. Users and devs were disappointed, and created a client that would reject their 2x blocks, an initiative called UASF (User-Activated Soft Fork). That client got enough traction to scare the miners out of their 2x fork, and activate SegWit on its own. The 2x client later turned out to have contained an off-by-one error that would have broken Bitcoin for a while.
The miners also decided to fork Bitcoin before activation of SegWit, which resulted in BCH. Note the price development of BCH.
tl;dr: One group of actors in the bitcoin ecosystem was trying to make a powerplay. They failed, but

The difficulty adjustment can go up or down. Hash rate will depend on average block reward and miner efficiency (including average block production cost). If the cost is too high, miners will stop, difficulty will decrease, and those that remain will continue. Eventually, it boils down to supply and demand.
@_date: 2018-03-13 07:39:53
increasing block sizes won't scale long term.

The point is that you can add zeros to the end of any figure, but your relative position won't change. If you own 1/21 millionth of all bitcoin in circulation, then you would still own 1/21 millionth of all satoshis in circulations. If we ever start using millisatoshis, you will still own 1/21 millionth of all millisatoshis.
People will always be able to value things in bitcoin, and the relative price of something in BTC might change, but the amount in your wallet can't be inflated away unless that change holds consensus, which I don't see happening, ever.

Replying to here, who was banned after willful ignorance and trolling:
I'm going to hazard a single reply (this thread has gone on long enough as it is, and has been patient enough with your repeated willful ignorance on every topic).


It isn't. The whole argument is built on the core developers not wanting to increase the block size cap. Meanwhile, blocks \*are\* bigger due to segwit and further capacity increases are in the works (Schnorr and MAST, look it up).


I'm assuming you are gunning at 0-conf transactions. These are not and never can be safe, and the BCH crowd is slowly starting to realize this. As usual, they decided to shift the narrative on when that became clear. Also, Satoshi himself always advised at least 6 confirmations. The choice is then: instant transactions with a chance of double spending, or waiting for confirmations. Since we want the network to be robust and dependable, the Core development team chose the latter.


This is correct. It is not faster (the 0-conf discussion), it is not cheaper (check fee history) and it is certainly not more reliable (check double spends on the BCH chain).


He tactfully pointed out your mistakes and false assumptions in the beginning of the thread. Then, you continued asking the same questions because you didn't like the answers you were getting. After a while, you were rightly called out as willfully ignorant. If you are trying to learn, you are not working without a bias. Know this of yourself, and correct your flaw in thinking.


You are cherrypicking a moment in time where Bitcoin (and all of crypto) was in a bubble. Check the prices over the entire year. Also; check the amount of transactions and what the mempool of BCH would have looked like if it was still 1Mb. That should tell you something. 


This is basic LN knowledge. The channels are funded with an on-chain transaction. All changes to balance are made off-chain. The final balance is pushed on-chain in a settlement transaction. Before you argue about the off-chain balance changes: if anyone misbehaves, you can contractually enforce compliance on-chain. Because of this, you don't need these balance transactions on-chain to retain the same trustlessness and on-chain guarantees.


Bitcoin is currently in its early adoption. Merchants flock in during bull seasons, then depart during bear seasons. This is standard economic market behavior that Bitcoin also experiences. Because of Bitcoin's early adoption phase, the price still heavily fluctuates between bubble and non-bubble market periods.
I hope this post is informative for you, and anyone else that has gone down the rabbit hole with us. Please take your time to process the information, and do it on your own, instead of bringing it to a community heavily biased against one side of the arguments. Check other subs, like or even in order to find out what people's perspectives are, regardless of their own bias.

Smartphones brought the internet to Africa, Asia, and South America. Most people in the western world used the internet prior to smartphones, but the effect they had on society and the use of technology is staggering. Very few people in 2000 could have foreseen that.

Yup, the are. Bulgary admitted it once, when they had just seized them. A week later, they claimed not to know anything. Either the government doesn't want it to be known, or someone in the government took the coins for him- or herself.

I recently listened to a podcast about the paper "Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and that's great" by [Conner Brown](  It touched on this subject. Housing is artificially kept expensive, because policy makers and people in local governments are pressured into doing so. Imagine if 30% more houses were built in a village. Housing prices would plummet instantly. 
Also, owning a house is nice, but if you sell 1 BTC, there is also at least one person buying it. If two buy it, what is to prevent them from paying what they feel is with just over half a house, further driving up the price?
