Plausible. Plot-twist: the hack was not because TPTB are against Bitcoin's ascent anymore (now that they've accumulated and perfected chain-analysis tools). They are waiting for the scheduled controlled demolition of the legacy financial system (and the rollout of whatever narrative best suits their NWO goals--probably anti-China/Russia). After the controlled demolition (likely this autumn), I'm expecting an ETF to be approved, so that Bitcoin will rise as an alternative global reserve currency, blocking the world reserve currency status of whatever gold-backed currency China and Russia back.

They want to list the ETF on Nasdaq. Some have speculated that Gemini is indirectly related to the ETF in that the ETF application may require that a fully compliant US-based Bitcoin exchange exist to provide liquidity to the ETF. But seems to me that ItBit could have fit that bill. Maybe they started planning Gemini before ItBit got its charter and there was no point in aborting Gemini at that stage, even though it was now redundant from the point of view of the market and the ETF application? Dunno.

I think Ross created a SR prototype and transferred it to an undercover government agent. I think the government then developed and ran SR, using it to implicate MTGox in money laundering to justify confiscation of all of the MTGox "lost" bitcoin. Karpeles was probably leaned on to finger Ross in exchange for immunity from prosecution. The Feds then framed Ross, most likely by staging his "caught red handed" arrest and planting the digital "evidence" after the fact. Alternatively, there could have been a period during which Ross was being tricked or pressured to implicate himself. During this period his computer could have been compromised, creating a digital crumb trail consistent with the fed's narrative. My point is that, given the governments current technological capabilities and lawlessness, anything is possible. It's crazy to trust them.

I very much doubt that Monero will ever supplant Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a chance of being the world's dominant transparent ledger. Monero has a chance of augmenting the utility of Bitcoin by becoming the dominant opaque ledger. It is absurd to categorically call Monero "technically superior" to Bitcoin. It surpasses Bitcoin in fungibility and privacy, but Bitcoin is superior in usability, liquidity, network effects, and regulatory risks. Also Bitcoin is more battle-tested, having survived six and a half years, while Monero has only reached its first birthday. Both are risky investments, but Monero is much riskier than Bitcoin.

Adam has said he's not advocating 1MB forever. The question is how to go about increasing the block size limit. Adam (if I understand correctly) would be ok with a modest increase "at the last minute," i.e. when it's absolutely necessary. That's because he thinks decentralization is the special thing about Bitcoin and it should be maximized. Given that it is much easier to lose decentralization than gain it, he is arguing that we should be very hesitant to take steps that guarantee a loss of decentralization, especially when the technological landscape is shifting so rapidly. Even though the situation seems to require urgent action now, it is possible (and some are arguing likely) that the Lightning network will allow us to have our cake (decentralization) and eat it too (scaling). It would be a shame if we panicked and settle for a less decentralized Bitcoin than we could have had. I hope that this is a fair paraphrase of Adam's position.

You seem to be sure that this is merely a family quarrel and we are all asking ourselves, "Is it good for Bitcoin?" You should consider the possibility that Bitcoin is under attack by forces that want to either kill it or co-opt it. The attempt to co-opt Bitcoin will be engineered to look like a "color revolution" -- like a populist uprising against purportedly unrepresentative despotic Core devs. IMHO XT is an attack on Bitcoin, an attempt to take it over and dilute it into BitPal, and if Coinbase is going to push XT, then Coinbase is no friend of Bitcoin.

The user experience is similar to Bitcoin in 2010 or 2011, except with much more privacy. The XMR community is much more motivated by privacy and liberty than the current Bitcoin community (but similar to the early Bitcoin community and the cypherpunks before them). An imperfect analogy might be XMR:Bitcoin as OpenBSD:Ubuntu.
From the point of view of investment/speculation, XMR is still in the very very early adopter phase. There is much more uncertainty regarding its future, but with that comes the possibility of very large speculative gains (or losses).
In sum, XMR is like Bitcoin, but more so.

You are right. It's hard to imagine a scenario in which Bitcoin has a fatal technological flaw that cannot be corrected and that does not affect other cryptocurrencies. But Bitcoin may be subject to political/financial attacks that other cryptocurrencies escape (for now). For example, no other cryptocurrency has been subject to the mainstream media FUD and selective prosecutions that have tarnished Bitcoin's image. This FUD has slowed Bitcoin adoption, serving the interests of banksters and governments.

This is actually a pretty good argument for why Bitcoin might fail to become widely adopted in the near future: opposition from nation-states. But it fails to take into account the likelihood that the current financial system presided over by nation-states is itself doomed. It also fails to take into account the asymmetric payoffs available to individuals, corporations, and renegade states that defect from the fiat imperium.

If you have time, please look into Monero. I think you'll find it is an unusually serious and honest attempt to create something enduring and important as a complement to Bitcoin. Much depends on how Bitcoin evolves. If it incorporates strong privacy features, Monero may never gain traction. But if regulators or political divisions between Bitcoin devs prevent Bitcoin from evolving in this direction, at least Monero and a few other projects will keep pushing forward.

**What is the Core Infrastructure Initiative?**
The Core Infrastructure Initiative is a multi-million dollar project to fund and support critical elements of the global information infrastructure. It is organized by The Linux Foundation and supported by Amazon Web Services, Adobe, Bloomberg, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, Hitachi, HP, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, NEC, Qualcomm, RackSpace, salesforce.com, and VMware. CII enables technology companies to collaboratively identify and fund open source projects that are in need of assistance, while allowing the developers to continue their work under the community norms that have made open source so successful.
**Who is involved in CII and what role do they play?**
Members of CII evaluate open source projects that are essential to global computing infrastructure and are experiencing under-investment. These companies recognize the need for directed funds for highly critical open source software projects they all consume and that run much of modern day society. They also value and invest in developers and collaborative software development and want to support this important work.
**Who is on the Advisory Board?**
The CII Advisory Board inform the CII Steering Committee about the open source projects most in need of support. With esteemed experts from the developer, security and legal communities, the CII Advisory Board plays an important role in prioritizing projects and individuals who are building the software that runs our lives. Advisory Board members include:
**Alan Cox**, a longtime Linux kernel developer and has been recognized by the Free Software Foundation for advancing free software.
**Matthew Green**,  a Research Professor of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University and a co-founder of the Open Crypto Audit Project. His research focuses on computer security and cryptography, and particularly the way that cryptography can be used to promote individual privacy.
**Dan Meredith**, a director at Radio Free Asia’s Open Technology Fund. He has been an activist and technologist exploring emerging trends intersecting human rights, transparency, global communication policy, the Internet, and information security for over a decade.
**Bruce Schneier**, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School and a well-recognized expert on computer security and privacy. He is also a fellow at New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute. 
**Eric Sears**, a Program Officer for Human Rights for MacArthur Foundation. His grant-making portfolio includes efforts to strengthen digital free expression and privacy through advancing a more open and secure Internet.
**Ted T’so** has been recognized as the first Linux kernel developer in North America and today is a file system developer at Google who also works on Kerberos v5 and /dev/random. T’so is also a member of the Internet Engineering Task Force and serves on its Security Area Directorate.

As you know, the judge prevented them from presenting their prepared defense. Beyond that, when the government engages in wrongdoing and is willing to lie about it ("parallel construction"), the defendant is helpless to figure out what really happened, let alone assemble proof that a judge would allow to be introduced and that would convince a jury of his innocence. If TPTB want to frame you, you're not going to be able to stop them. I believe Ross was framed and realized that accusing the government (the most likely culprits) of framing him would never fly in court, so instead Ross's team came up with the theory that Mark Karpeles was the arch-villain.

This actually makes sense. Maybe the FBI or NSA figured out that MK is DPR and confiscated the MtGox coins and forced MK to keep quiet or be prosecuted. Then they used DPR to frame Ross. This way they get to keep the 600k "stolen" bitcoin. One problem with this theory is that DPR seemed to have a much better command of the English language than MK.

DPR ran it to the ground. We know that Dratel thinks DPR = MK, but maybe SR and DPR are a psy-op and MK was the intended patsy. He then holds the MtGox btc hostage and offers them to FBI for immunity. That's why Baltimore sabotages the investigation of MK; he already had immunity. So they need to find another patsy.

"They" refers to the conjectured three-letter-agency that covertly purchased SR from Ross and used SR sockpuppets and maybe an MtGox infiltrator to frame MK as DPR in order to blackmail him and besmirch Bitcoin's reputation. If he retained control over the 600k btc, he may have used that as leverage to escape the attempt to frame him. By making Ross the scapegoat, the TLA gets the 600k btc, the prosecutors get a scalp, MK goes free, the regulators get a pretext to clamp down on financial freedom, and the banksters benefit from the FUD to accumulate btc.

@_date: 2016-03-21 12:02:54
There are two basic economic lenses through which to view the economics of blockchain. The
first is to view the economics of the adoption and diffusion of the blockchain as powerful new
ICT technology. Such a technology-based approach is currently the default perspective in the
finance and banking sector, viewing blockchain as a new technology that will be adopted
differentially by some banks, leading to a further round of technological competition in the
banking sector. The conclusion to this view is to expect the same market process as we have
seen with other technologies: some banks will adapt and prosper, others will lag and collapse.
Their success will depend on their strategic choices and uses of this new technology to drive
productivity and competitive efficiency.
But there is also a second economic perspective, focusing not on technology, but on
governance. This view based on economic reasoning, begins by asking what type of
technology is blockchain. The answer to that question, we have argued in this chapter, is that
blockchain is fundamentally a technology of decentralization and is therefore better
understood as a new institutional technology for coordinating people—i.e., for making
economic transactions—which then competes with firms and markets. This path seeks to 
understand what economic transactions currently occurring in firms or markets will shift to
The new institutional economics and public choice economics of blockchains emphasize
disintermediation and decentralization. In a world of blockchains the functions and operations
of banking may not change, but the economic organization of banking may shift significantly.
In this view, it is banks that will experience fundamental shifts in their organizational
boundaries, with many transactions currently governed through hierarchy, relational
contracting or market transactions shifting to the blockchain as an outworking of economic
efficiency over transaction costs.
Blockchain is a technology for internal exit from incumbent institutions. Simultaneously
it is a technology for the creation of new institutions. The upshot of this is emergent
economies built on blockchains. This is a political-economic rupture and bifurcation in which
an incumbent institutional order precipitates a constellaxy—a constitutionally ordered
catallaxy. The relevance of the development of blockchains for banking is that it has shifted
the boundary between hierarchical banking organizations and non-territorial, spontaneously
ordered, self-organizing economies. This transition suggests the future of banking will be
conducted in more evolvable and dynamically efficient institutions of governance.

The fees would grow on the mainchain, but there would still be low fee transactions on Lightning Network (a secure layer of potential Bitcoin transactions that only get settled on the mainchain intermittently). Most users wouldn't need to know they were using LN rather than the mainchain. They would have similar security guarantees, but LN would be far cheaper, faster, and possibly more private.

We know Satoshi was interested in exploring ring-signatures for privacy and we know he was interested in extending Bitcoin's smart contract capabilities.

It would be better for humanity if strong privacy existed in communications and Bitcoin transactions, despite the possibility of misuse by bad guys, because such privacy helps keep even worse bad guys from permanently capturing the state.

They disagree that the sky is falling with regard to transaction congestion. They think SegWit addresses the immediate transaction congestion concerns (and improves a lot of other things). They feel hard forks should be used only as a last resort because they are risky. They think that other solutions in development (such as Lightning Network) may decrease the need for blocksize limit increases. And Moore's law along with improvements in bandwidth will make blocksize limit increases less and less risky with time, so why not wait as long as possible?

Monero's constant tail emission starts out at &lt;1% of primary emission and decreases (in percentage terms) from there, which is called dis-inflationary.

There was always going to be a PayPalCoin or a GovCoin under centralized control. If Bitcoin Classic opts to become that, so be it. It will meet the same fate as all the fiat currencies, since human beings are corruptible, and centralized control of money allows them to profit from corruption. In the worst case scenarios, Core devs will either hardfork to a new PoW or will launch a new competing altcoin or will join an existing altcoin project whose goals match up with theirs. Even though the ensuing turmoil will be awful, in the long run cryptocurrency is too good an idea to fail.

Thanks for the tldr. As Bitcoin's privacy and fungibility improve, if it is able to stay decentralized and incorporate level 2 scaling, it will almost certainly remain the predominant chain with a larger market cap than all of its competitors put together. Specifically re: Monero, since you bring it up, almost all the early adopters who participated in Bitcointalk and Reddit discussions are also pro-Bitcoin. There has also been a friendly exchange of technical help between Bitcoin and Monero developers on IRC over the years. I first heard of Monero soon after its birth because of uncharacteristically-enthusiastic endorsement of ring-signature tech on a Reddit post in 2014. Network effects plus tribalism plus the narcissism of small differences ensures that friendly competition occasionally will flare up into hostility, but the vast majority of plausible scenarios involve both Bitcoin and Monero surviving and gradually incorporating aspects of each other's innovations but also differentiating enough that they occupy different niches and serve as hedges against unforeseen technological or political vulnerabilities. Although you are right that Monero is significantly less pruneable than Bitcoin, how detrimental that is to its viability depends on how quickly storage and bandwidth costs drop. Remember that Monero will also benefit from layer 2 scaling, such as Lightning and Tumblebit and perhaps sidechains, and has other differentiating features, such as a tail emission to incentivize miners indefinitely, a flexible block size limit, the use of an alternative elliptic curve, etc... Finally, people drawn to Monero are even more fanatical than Bitcoiners about financial privacy. Because of the importance of community consensus in upgrading public blockchains, it is probably going to be easier politically to upgrade Monero than it has been to upgrade Bitcoin. I agree that altcoin holders are incentivized to throw a wrench in efforts to improve Bitcoin, although in practice I think other spoilers from disintermediable trusted third parties are more important, including agents of banksters and governments.

My conspiracy theory (a term invented by the CIA to discredit those who asked too many questions), is that the banksters and their intel agency servants identified Bitcoin as a threat (and an opportunity) and decided to slow its adoption so they could maximally accumulate (confiscate, steal, or purchase). They adopted various methods to slow its adoption, including fud in the mainstream media, agents provocateurs to make Bitcoin look scary, regulatory uncertainty, high profile selective prosecutions of Bitcoin entrepreneurs, and dirty tricks using intelligence operatives and undercover law enforcement agents. They infiltrated, coopted, discredited, and neutered the Bitcoin Foundation. They duped Ross into handing over SR to an intel agency operative, who then (as DPR) ran it as a honeypot but also as a psy-op to discredit both MtGox and Bitcoin, as primarily being used by criminals for illegal drugs and money laundering. They confiscated MtGox funds and likely infiltrated and sabotaged its operations, culminating in either stealing MK's cold storage private keys or rendering them inaccessible to him. Alternatively, perhaps they simply threatened him with prosecution if he didn't hand them over and shut up. I think the investigator DY was working earnestly, but accidentally unraveled an ongoing undercover operation to frame MK (and Ashley Barr, who says he isn't an operative) as DPR. So DY had to be stopped and a new patsy was chosen to take the fall as DPR: Ross, who was appealing because of his earlier involvement in SR. Evidence was planted on Ross's laptop by hacking it, incriminating him as the one and only DPR. The Shrem and SR prosecutions have dovetailed with BitLicense hearings and finalization. I doubt that's a mere coincidence. I also don't think it's a coincidence that MK is being arrested, and AB is holding an AMA painting MK as the bad guy, days after MK wrote on his Tumblr that he is close to figuring out what really happened with SR and MtGox. But maybe that's just me being a paranoid conspiracy theorist.

Just to be clear, I agree with that the Bitcoin core devs have been incredibly dedicated. I'm pretty sure that they could all be enjoying lower blood pressure and cortisol levels working on other projects. Bitcoin is very lucky to have attracted such a talented group of cryptographers and computer scientists. I too have been following the Bitcoin development process closely since 2011 and I can't discern any legitimate reason to doubt the motivations of any of the devs. All of them want Bitcoin to succeed. It's painful to witness the incivility they face when they engage with Bitcointalk and Reddit mobs.

The Deep State's motive is not to devalue Bitcoin in the long-term. Their motive has been to devalue it in the short-term (by FUD, SR show-trial, BitLicense delays, futures market manipulation) all the better to accumulate bitcoin (by theft, hacks, and off-exchange purchases). The Deep State will be the largest holder of the next world reserve currency.

The only way I could find to have it go directly to Breadwallet is to manually delete all of the other wallet apps from my iPhone. (Maybe not all, but several wallets had to be deleted. It is as if the wallets were "in line" to handle the call from Fold, but there is no way to move Breadwallet to the front of the line except to delete the other wallets.)
Edit: Make sure you transfer your bitcoin funds before deleting any of your wallets!!

Please read more about fiat vs non-fiat money. Fiat money is imposed on a population "by fiat," ie by law backed by coercion. Non-fiat money is adopted voluntarily by a group without coercion. This distinction has nothing to do with intrinsic value. If the government declared iPhones to be legal tender, they'd take on a monetary value that could greatly exceed their "intrinsic value."

I think this is actually one of the strongest reasons to think that Bitcoin *might* become the world's reserve currency. If the US recognizes the inevitability of the dollar losing reserve currency status, then it has a very powerful incentive to block any rival establishing its currency as the new reserve currency. The US could accumulate and support Bitcoin's ascendency as a way to block China. My guess is that the US (and other powers that be) have already been accumulating BTC and that the intel agencies and central bankers like how easy it will be to track Bitcoin compared to physical cash.

1) Most Monero supporters (including myself) were first Bitcoin maximalists like you. Monero is the only alt I have ever taken seriously. As you know, CryptoNote coins (like Monero) are not just clones of Bitcoin. Bytecoin should not be mentioned as a legitimate "competitor" of Monero, since it was 82% ninja-mined, which breaks its anonymity. Given that the vast majority of Bytecoin is held by the scammers who released it, its market cap cannot be meaningfully compared to a coin like Monero that is fairly mined and distributed.
2) xmr.to is unidirectional, facilitating selling of XMR and buying of BTC (you are spending XMR, xmr.to pays a BTC address). Shapeshift.io is bidirectional.
3) You are right that XMR is immature and much riskier (as an investment) than BTC. But it also offers much higher potential gains. It is comparable in risk-reward terms to investing in BTC in 2010.
4) You are right that pruning is an issue. It's hard to know how important that will be (given advances in networking and storage) and there are ideas (such as Lightning Network) that could mitigate it.

We should probably talk about this on but actually it is "disinflationary" after an initial emission of 18.4 million; i.e. after that point there will be a constant block reward of approx 0.3 coins per minute, which means it will be a constantly decreasing percentage of total emission. The rationale is there there are many reasons to think that a block reward (rather than fees) are necessary to incentivize miners, since Monero has an adaptive block size limit.
Edit: You should also consider that once supply inflation is less than one percent per annum, coin supply will eventually reach a steady state because of loss of private keys owing to accidents, death, theft, etc. . . . So it will be effectively a constant supply at that point.

I agree though about the refund address; it would be nice if we didn't have to re-use it. (I guess I'm a hypocrite, even though I'm leaning towards a conservative approach to the max block size limit, I do like paying for coffee on the mainchain!)

If the scenario you outline comes to pass, it will be just another example of the powers that be winning a transient, pyrrhic victory over freedom. Core's vision is for a Bitcoin that resists capture by private or public special interests. That Blockstream is a private entity supported by VC is usually a cause for worry (as in Google's "don't be evil" motto, which has become a joke), but Blockstream is operating under a tremendous amount of scrutiny by freedom-loving cypherpunks who expect it to live up to it's motto of "can't be evil." If it deviates from that, it will deservedly be abandoned. But I see no evidence of that, yet.

@_date: 2016-09-04 18:53:28
Correct me if I'm wrong One important caveat is that Monero's dynamic block size feature requires a perpetual emission in order to properly incentivize miners. In Monero, this will be accomplished with a constant 0.3 xmr/minute "tail emission" after the initial 18.4 M xmr emission; this will cause a very small and ever-decreasing supply inflation. Even though it would make little difference for most use cases, I'm pretty sure adding a tail emission to Bitcoin would be contentious. 21M bitcoins is part of Bitcoin's unwritten Constitution at this point.

Aside from Bitcoin, the only cryptocurrency I own is Monero (XMR). I got into Monero for the same reason I got into Bitcoin, namely because it offers a private way to store and transfer value without trusting or seeking permission from financial institutions that have proven themselves untrustworthy. I think both of them have a bright long-term future, with Bitcoin having a much stronger network effect and utility as a transparent, decentralized, secure ledger and Monero having utility as private digital cash. I'm also intellectually interested in the Ethereum project, but I'm not at all sure how to value Ether.

The mom (smallblocker) wants to very gradually wean the baby off breast-milk and transition to baby food (somewhat larger blocks). She says the baby will eventually develop teeth (the Lightning Network) and we should wait until then to introduce solid food (much larger blocks). The dad wants to shove a shove a piece of roast beef and a carrot down the baby's throat and see what happens. He says their neighbor is an emergency room doctor, so no big deal if the baby's gums bleed or it chokes. They both want the baby to grow up. They disagree on the timetable.

You have valid concerns. I've been following the debate pretty closely. Adam Back has said many times in the past few weeks that he is in support of 2mb blocks now, gradually rising to 4mb blocks in two years and 8mb blocks in 4 years and then pausing there to re-assess.
By the way, if a world crisis occurred and Bitcoin was overwhelmed and stopped working, then the need for a max block size increase would be obvious to everyone and the danger of a "contentious" hard fork would approach zero. In that situation, a hard fork could safely occur in days, I believe.

Quoted from the linked paper:
Duplex micropayment channels solve a multitude of problems. For one they
enable near-infinite scalability for digital payments based on Bitcoin. Bitcoin
transactions are no longer used directly to transfer bitcoins from a sender to
a recipient, instead they are used to setup micropayment channels and handle
conflict resolution. The actual transfers are now handled at a higher level through
a network of payment service providers. The payments are end-to-end secure
thanks to the use of hashed timelock contracts, ensuring transfers between hops
are only performed if the intended recipient receives its payment. Unlike Bitcoin,
which requires a long confirmation process, transfers on a network of duplex
micropayment channels are secure from being reverted. Thus a payment network
using duplex micropayment channels is a far better fit for real-time scenarios,
e.g., buying a coffee, since transfers can be performed at the same speed messages
are passed in the Internet. With a network of payment service providers, Bitcoin
can support true micropayments with minimal fees at unprecedented scale, and
where the transfers clear in real-time.

I am agreeing with you that TPTB will not go gently into that good night. In fact, it would not surprise me if they invented or commissioned or infiltrated/co-opted Bitcoin. It is very difficult to use Bitcoin securely and privately. Bitcoin may end up empowering the surveillance/security state and the banksters who finance it. Even if the protocol is secure, if all of our hardware, BIOS, and operating systems are backdoored, we can be monitored and flushed from The Matrix as soon as we become problematic. So TPTB may in fact be welcoming and surreptitiously promoting Bitcoin (and accumulating it), because they know it is not a real threat. I think the privacy-focused coin Monero is more Bitcoin than Bitcoin and so is much more likely to upset the status quo in the ways Satoshi hoped for. But what do I know?

Paging (one of the developers); I think you are basically correct. From a user's perspective, the untraceability and unlinkability happens automatically. You pick a "mixin" level (which determines how many other signatures are mixed-in with yours on the ring signature), an amount, a receiving "stealth" address, and an optional payment ID. The Monero blockchain has very little information for corporations or criminals to mine. I'm pretty sure the NSA would be able to de-anonymize you somehow, if they wished to do so. But for ordinary purposes, Monero offers privacy. See  for more info.

Thanks. Those are important clues. This was not some trivially-spoofed email. It was a motivated intervention into the blocksize debate by someone who has access to one of Satoshi's email accounts--and has before and after refrained from using said access to their advantage. There are innumerable ways a hacker could exploit such access to manipulate the Bitcoin development process or market for personal gain. But this "hacker" displays amazing self-restraint, intervening only when it appears Bitcoin may be on the verge of irreversibly selling its soul to the XT crowd. And this "hacker" chooses to echo the publicly-stated concerns of Adam Back, Nick Szabo et al, that the XT crowd was misconstruing Satoshi's intentions to manipulate the debate. These are guys who are definitely very close to Satoshi in spirit and intellect and who are in the small set of people who may actually be him. And then Adam actually cites that email several times in the Reddit debates, asserting that he thinks it authentic. He knows this is not provable, yet chooses to assert it anyway. There's a hint of emotionality in the email too that fits with the extraordinary spectacle of Adam and Nick's contemporaneous tweets, in which they go so far as to question the motives of the XT crowd and assert that Bitcoin will no longer be worth saving if the big-blockers prevailed. 
I know none of this is definitive, but these "soft signs" suggest to me that the email was more likely than not from the collective we know as Satoshi. He's still with us, and he was furious at XT and feels betrayed by Gavin and Mike. That's my take on the dev list email.

If you choose a large ring size (like 100 signatures), then all that can be asserted is that one of those 100 signatures was the true sender. But the 99 decoy signatures can be from any prior transactions on the blockchain. So the anonymity set is anyone who has ever used Monero. (I think).

With 100 bits (a bit is one millionth of a bitcoin) all you can do is open a account and have fun giving them away to other Redditors. If you are interested in buying bitcoin, go to Coinbase.com or Circle.com. You can spend bitcoin at Dell.com, Expedia.com, Gyft.com, Overstock.com, and many other merchants. Or you can send them to anyone else who has a smartphone or a PC. Both of you will have to have accounts at an online Bitcoin wallet (such as coinbase.com) or a smartphone wallet (Bread Wallet on iOS or Mycelium on Android) or a Mac/PC/Linux wallet (Electrum is a good one). Since the price of bitcoin is constantly changing, some people like to invest or speculate in bitcoin, hoping to buy low and sell high. Check out bitcoinwisdom.com for the latest prices.

My pet theory: Ross is not motivated by money, but by idealism. He coded up SR as an experiment in free market principles. It was far more successful than he expected; he didn't want to run it but also didn't want to shut it down. He was then tricked into transferring it to an undercover government agent, who was tasked to run it as a honeypot to implicate MtGox and FUD Bitcoin. This government agency infiltrated MtGox and stole MtGox's cold storage wallet, but couldn't access the bitcoin without Mark Karpeles's cooperation. MK cooperated and was granted immunity. The easiest person to frame, now that MK was off the table, was Ross. No one would believe that someone who created SR could have just walked away from it. The MtGox bitcoin were auctioned off as "Silk Road" bitcoin.

As long as you keep using the same wallet that you used to generate a Bitcoin address, any coins ever sent to that address are yours. That is because you are the only person in possession of the private key associated with that Bitcoin address. The private keys for all your Bitcoin addresses are stored in your wallet. It is very very very very unlikely that anyone else will ever randomly be assigned a Bitcoin address that is the same as one of yours. The only way you can lose control of an address is if you lose or share its private key.

The biggest threat to Bitcoin (in the sense of decentralized financial power) is the surveillance state. Bitcoin (the protocol and currency) may be co-opted by the surveillance state (and possibly already has been). The NSA (or GCHQ or Unit 8200) can make Bitcoin unusable by harvesting private keys via hardware and software backdoors. Ironically, if the NSA has this capability, then it has an incentive to promote the spread of Bitcoin worldwide. As Bitcoin grows, the NSA will attain the power to control political and economic processes with pinpoint accuracy. Russia and China's hostility to Bitcoin may derive from their knowledge of NSA's capabilities and plans.

Monero owes Satoshi a great debt (for proof-of-work consensus ) but is based on a distinct codebase (CryptoNote) and is working actively to solve the problem highly-private financial transactions, in which the payer, the payee, the amounts, and the IP addresses are all obfuscated. This is very far from Bitcoin's current capabilities, but takes a big step away from Big Brother and towards the Cypherpunks who motivated Satoshi in the first place.
