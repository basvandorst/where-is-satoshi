It’s a futures market based on the Gemini spot prices.
Ignoring the implications of a futures market, I think the most important thing is that this is a large regulated US financial institution running the market. This allows institutional money to come in heavily — long or short. Previously much of this money may have been sidelined by regulatory or internal rules.

So you sat on 500 BTC for at least 5 years. Didn't budge until yesterday/today when you sold it all. Liquidated that all into fiat instantly. Then paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes months early for some reason?

Look into dollar-cost averaging. Put in a small amount every week or month you can afford. Don't worry too much about the price fluctuation.
You'll probably never be a good market timer and you're certainly not one at the moment. Reading Reddit comments won't make you one either.

Yeah, such blatant bullshit. Basically he sold yesterday, somehow instantly turned that into cash, and then instantly paid taxes...like 5 months early for no reason in particular.

You'd need to live there for 10 years before cashing out. If you do it right away you'd still be subject to basically normal US cap gains.

True. But I’m pretty sure this stat is showing all transactions including exchange trades from a period last year.
It’d be interesting to break out actual payments. But seems difficult.

To the people saying don't tell her, what's the end game of that? What if BTC goes to $50,000? What if they end up staying together forever?

Definitely a problem worth considering. For a sense of scale, Bitcoin is using about 30 TWh a year. Overall world consumption of power is something like 200,000 TWh a year.

Only up to first $37,950. The cap gains aren't taxed as ordinary income but they still count for determining your brackets.

Somewhat random but interesting comparison:
.069% Bitcoin market cap as a percentage of global wealth (~$270T)
.015% Bitcoin power usage as a percentage of global power usage

The volume just on exchanges in the last 24 hours is over $10 billion. That puts it above MasterCard.
I think this is a tad out of date...

Buying establishes cost basis. I guess you could say that is a "tax" event though not a "taxable" event.

I'm a late adopter, but very happy to be up 30% :)
