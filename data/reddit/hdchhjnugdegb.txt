Seems like a good opportunity to link to this classic clip:

I reckon once someone has bought some bitcoin in the hope it will rise in value they are more likely to look for ways to use it because they have a vested interest in its success

I'm Bitcoin and so's my wife

I'm not so sure it's an either/or. I believe in Bitcoin as a store of value (long term). As a result I use it as a currency as much as I can because I want it to succeed

One of the few places that accepts Bitcoin in the UK is CEX. They buy and sell second hand blurays etc. Because I want to support Bitcoin I make a point of going there to buy movies on bluray, which I return and sell back to them when watched. So, ironically, Bitcoin has resurrected the Blockbuster business model.

So you are asking if Trezor is more secure  than itself??? Your question is incoherent

P.S. though, if a gang of criminals were going to put pressure on Satoshilabs it would be more efficient to make them install compromised firmware updates on everyone's Trezors than to go after individual users one at a time.

I had mine delivered to someone else's address while I was staying with them for precisely this reason. If the heavy mob knock on the door they'll have the wrong address. You guessed right, I don't much like the person I was staying with
