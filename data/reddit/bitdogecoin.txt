TBH I was surprised it would drop as much as it did bearing in mind what seems like a huge market cap. But then....I remembered that 600BN cap (all cryptos) isn't really much more than a drop in the ocean and that crazy swings will still be quite normal, at least until the market cap of crypto gets into the 10's of Trillions.....

I think Dogecoin has a bright future....too many people following it for it to collapse.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:21:27
So others apart from me have, today, dozens of times,  specifically said that any Bitcoin transfer over 2 Btc from MtGox is delayed and support takes days to respond? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:19:33
I made 7 small withdrawal requests over 2 days. 4 were processed immediately, the other 3 are hung up. You can use your browser's search or find tool to look up your stuck withdrawal here

 "Only room for one cryptocurrency?"
Yes, one of us may be deluded. If you haven't yet figured out that there is a place for Doge (and its 65,500 and rapidly rising number of Redditors) then the deluded one might not be me.

Vs. someone totally ignorant of Bitcoin but with strong opinions on it, like Jonathan Trugman (NY Post), I would beg to differ. He is never civil when talking about it.

Western Union and their ilk will be toast thanks to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:47:07
Because withdrawing fiat has been impossible for weeks. At least Bitcoin withdrawals should start in a few days.

5 percent. So you have to bet on getting a return of more than 2000% in order to make the gamble worthwhile.
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:38:54
Anything from 0.1 Btc to 4 Btc. I think it was 0.1, 1, 1, 1.5, 1.58, 1.87 and 4. I'm missing 1, 1.87 and 4.
I'm not sure how many hours you'd have to wait before your transaction appears in the list. I don't know why it's not showing up. Sorry.

I agree with OP's assertion that 80% of the population would be put off by the high dollar price per bitcoin as well as the fractions, decimals etc. that such a high value (and hopefully much higher in the future) necessitates. I think we should just move the decimal point 4 places to the right and call them "Bitcoins"....similar to a share split so that no-one loses value on their holdings and Bitcoin maintains its deflationary characteristics. No need then for satoshis, millythis, microthat. And, noobs would be able to buy lots of whole bitcoins with relatively few dollars.

I lost 5 Btc there. Actually, after withdrawals were banned and their price started going haywire I even did some trades and turned that into 12 Btc although those were obviously worthless Gox coins. 
I have no intention of ever using them again. I doubt many people who lost coin there will ever consider using them again unless they get fully reimbursed. Because of Gox you've now got idiots like Sen. Joe Manchin calling for cryptocoins to be banned.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:29:53

"Apple vs. Microsoft"....I guess this means Bitcoin and Dogecoin will happily co-exist for years!
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:23:33
I had about 5.75 Btc re-credited to my account (still missing another 1.3 Btc). I sent out 6 separate transfer requests for amounts varying from 0.5 to 1.65 Btc. 2 made it into the Blockchain, the other 4 transactions have, once again, joined the MtGox Hall of Shame. 
The damage done to Bitcoin by MtGox these past few days is MASSIVE. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:53:46
The MtGox "Price" is bogus.

That's an easy question to answer: Just in time to buy at $1000US.

Dogecoin is no joke. The difference between Bitcoin and Dogecoin is that Doge users are not trying to baffle everyday folks with how smart they are and how stupid everyone else is. Doge users are busy trying to bring more investors, in the shape of friends and family, on board.
I own Bitcoin and Dogecoin and I'm constantly amazed at the difference in attitudes there is between and users.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:41:47
Bitcoin is also a store of value, your credit card isn't a place you store investment capital.
Bitcoin can't be used to give your personal information to identify thieves.
Eventually Bitcoin purchases will be cheaper than credit card purchases as retailers acknowledge there's no 3% merchant fee being charged by Bitcoin.
Both have advantages that few would give up. I see Bitcoin and Credit cards as peacefully co-existing. The same cannot be said for Western Union/Moneygram and Bitcoin. Money transfer services and their exorbitant fees will soon be a thing of the past.
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:33:59
So you're saying that from mid 2015 to about 2021 Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme? Because it'll inflate faster during that period than Dogecoin.
The 5 billion isn't enough to make it over-inflationary. Time to buy some cheap Dogecoin because it (or something like it) will at least as appealing as the decimal places, microbits, millibits and Satoshi's that will rapidly define Bitcoin to the small investor/spender.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:33:21
I'd like to see the community agree to move the decimal point four places to the right. Do it like a share split. If you own 2 Btc now you'll own 20,000 of the "new" Btc. Your holding would have the same value. Voila! there would be a total of 210 Billion Bitcoins (when all are mined) and it would be very user friendly  with no need for decimal places. Plus, noobs would be able to buy lots of Bitcoin for relatively little money. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:07:18
Not so...Dogecoin will, over the next 10 years, inflate much less than Bitcoin. Once November arrives it'll inflate at 5% for the first year and less each year thereafter.

Scary that one never reads about these evil people being caught and jailed.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:49:57
Thanks for that. A valuable contribution indeed. Care to tell me where I've gone wrong? "Volume" is now up to over 58,000 BTC even though no new coin can enter MtGox. If only Fiat is entering the exchange such "Volume" (if real) means people are only buying Bitcoin within MtGox. And yet the price keeps dropping. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:15:32
I do not plan on keeping my coins there.
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:07:19
Not really. It's only MTGOX which is showing a drop of about 100US in the last few hours. The other exchanges are showing drops of just 20US to 30US which is hardly dramatic.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:24:25
Dogecoin is only "extremely inflationary" for another year or so...once the 100BN have been mined next year, only 5Bn a year will be added, mainly to account for transaction confirmations and the odd lost coins. For a few years it'll actually be less inflationary than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:26:12
I moved my Btc from Btc-e 2 weeks ago when I found out they were censoring mentions of Dogecoin on their chat board. Pathetic.

Did Andreas say that all the exchanges with withdrawal issues have been fixed and are open for business? MtGox?

By the time your money gets credited to your Gox account (you have to allow at least 10 days) the issue will likely have been resolved one way or the other and the price will have gone up again. 
Better to buy some coins on Localbitcoin right now while the real price is still quite low and you will still probably profit nicely when all of this Gox nonsense is over and done with.

If you count the statistics from every dice roll you might be right. But, if you count the statistics to include the amount gambled, nope. You put money and computers together and you're gonna get fraud. Just like on line poker..play for tiny stakes or the "play poker" game (.net) that every site has and you'll win. Play for a little serious money and most will lose.

I'm starting to think that a lot of Litecoin is moving into Dogecoin. Look at Litecoin's performance in value and CAP over the last week or so. Is Litecoin starting to sink as people look for a viable alternative altcoin?

One of the Big Boys, be it Amazon, Target, Wal-Mart, Expedia or another will eventually accept Bitcoin and then most of the others will follow.

"Is dogecoin the exception?" With close to 65,000 Redditors following it after just 2 months I'd say, Yes, it's pretty exceptional.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:32:06
I doubt anyone would want to buy MtGox. Its reputation is now irreparably damaged, no sane bitcoiner would ever use them again. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:35:48
There's nothing "free market" about this bunch of scammers. They announce a coin to pump over Twitter at a pre-determined time. No-one knows what coin it is except them and they've already got their fingers on the "sell" button when the announcement is made. I watched this live last night on Luckycoin. It was up and down in 2 minutes flat. RIP OFF. A bad advert for all cryptocoins.

Logic tells me that the current ridiculously low price on Gox has been manipulated from within. Further, Karpeles' unwillingness to assure that protester the other day that his coins and funds were safe is very ominous.
I am 50% sure that Gox will renew withdrawals this month and no-one loses coins. 25% that withdrawals resume and many customers lose coins. 25% chance that nothing good happens and Gox goes under.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:14:32
With what is going on at Gox these days I'd say the joke is on all of us. 2014 has been a horrible year so far for Bitcoin.

The matter of Btc withdrawal problems only happened in the last few weeks. I didn't ever try and withdraw fiat. Until then I had no problem withdrawing Btc. Thank the stars.
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:48:13
But selling Btc for USD at these dismal rates? Seems unlikely. I would think most people will be ready for a big Bitcoin surge once MtGox fixes their problem.
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:30:39
Ripple's "value" and ridiculous market cap are completely artificial. Just look at the pathetic trading volume. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:45:36
I have 5 Btc there, a small fraction of my total stash. I hold out almost no hope of ever getting them back. I have not been trading. I'm just leaving them there. Will withdraw as soon as it's allowed (if ever...I'm not at all hopeful and I've already mentally written them off). 
Trading should not be permitted at Gox. I would like to see the Bitcoin Foundation issue a statement urging MtGox to halt all trading.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:14:22
They would have to refund me first. And then I STILL wouldn't use them.

Hold those Bitcoin or spend them on something nice, don't gamble them away.
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:35:43
MtGox is no longer a "bitcoinmarket." It's an internally manipulated fake.
