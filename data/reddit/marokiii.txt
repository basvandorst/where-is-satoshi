theres also physical money that can do this as well. eventually to get those illegal items you are going to either meet up in person or have to give them an address to ship the items to, so its not anonymous anymore. 
just use physical cash to buy them.

It usually can. Also with newer products coming out forcing older products to be cheaper,  I can usually buy more of what I can get today cheaper in a year. 
Inflation is very small and a dollar today can usually buy me about the same a year from now. A year from now a bitcoin is not going to be near it's price it is now.

unless the price stabilizes for a long period of time nobody is going to actually use Bitcoin as a currency. why would i spend my Bitcoins on something today when tomorrow chances are my Bitcoins will be worth more than they are today? ill basically be throwing money away.
the reason physical currencies issued by the govt actually get used regularly as actual money is because the value of them is stable, i can comfortably spend US currency on physical items because i know that $1 today is most likely still going to be worth the same amount tomorrow, or a year from now.

the dollar hasnt lost its purchasing power on the scale you think. sure for some things the price has skyrocketed like housing, education and healthcare but for most things its held stable. 
yes the hamburger meal costs $10 now when before it was $2. but my wage has also increased dramatically. in 1957 the full time wage for a man over 14 years old was only $4700. that was the average wage, today the bare minimum wage would be around $15000. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:22:49
i wouldnt be willing to use it even @ $1 per transaction because i know that if i use it to buy something today, i could of bought more of that same item using Bitcoins in a weeks time. 
its all an investment now and every single person i know who has Bitcoins is not buying them to use as a currency.

so the fake ID that is being bought by the person i was responding to is using that fake ID he is getting shipped to his PO box to open that PO box and then uses that same fake ID to receive the package that has it inside.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:29:55
which i use an ID to open and use.

that would mean 868 people arent incarcerated then either. they take the % of 100,000 people they have and apply that multiple to the people already in jail.
so for simplicity, if they have 50,000 people and 434 people in jail, then their rate would be 868 per 100,000.
@_date: 2014-09-25 02:54:52
they also state that that number doesnt include a large number of people such as those incarcerated in U.S. Territories, military facilities, ICE, and for jails in Indian country or youths.
they dont make this distinction for any of the other countries, so i wonder if those groups or their equivalents are taken into consideration in the other stats.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:18:45
but that goes against the previous statement of dont ever sell. if you dont plan on ever selling, investing in bitcoin is a horrible thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:58:43
is this a serious question or are you just misunderstanding how almost everyone in other countries talks about healthcare?
Free healthcare doesnt mean there is no cost to it, it means its free at the point of use. you and everyone else pays for it with taxes, but its free for everyone to use who meets certain requirements(usually citizenship). 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:03:39
okay so make roads, and then charge me no more than a current road costs me to drive on. that cost to me right now is $0. so build me a road for free and let me use it as much as i want. otherwise yes, privatization of all roads will lead to super expensive costs for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:56:55
when pretty much everyone talks about FREE healthcare they dont mean free of any cost, they mean free at the point of receiving the healthcare. so they pay in advance with taxes(at a much lower amount than if they paid when they get hurt or sick), and then receive the care later and dont have to pay anything more. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:34:56
UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, The Bahamas and Brunei all have ZERO INCOME TAXES. 
so if you do not like all the things that are provided by taxes like income taxes, you can move to one of those 11 countries. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:43:55
its because its free to use whenever we need it or how ever much we need of it regardless of if we can pay anything at that exact moment. 
i can show up at my hospital at any time and receive the same care as someone else who also shows up there with the same injuries without worrying that they are going to toss me out because i cant pay. i dont have to show them anything else besides my identification, theres no checking and haggling with insurance before i get properly treated above the bare minimum. i am just treated freely whenever needed. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:40:59
dont buy property and dont run a business then either. its now your choice on what you buy to avoid things like sales taxes. in pretty much all of those countries you can survive with just cash and buy things from people to avoid taxes you would normally have to pay for at businesses. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:15:02
if i dont ever sell, than im not really given any more. ive actually lost my initial investment since thats money i dont have now and wont get back since im not ever selling. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:40:07
no its not circular, at the age of 18 you have the legal right to move about regardless of how your parents want. at that age you have the right to move away from the USA because you believe the govt is stealing from you. if you do not move away, than that is implied consent to the taxation. 
where is the circle in that?
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:53:08
because 100% of the rest of society has agreed to live this way and most of us think it is the best way we can live. if you dont agree you have 3 options. 1 move completely away to somewhere where there are no taxes or levels of tax you can live with. 2 get involved in government and convince a significant portion of society that we should change the fundamentals of how we live, or 3 continue living here and pay your taxes as you have always agreed to do. 
and comparing govt to a rapist invading is completely wrong. the govt hasnt invaded and they are not raping you. you accept the govt coming in willingly(by simply CHOOSING to stay here you are accepting the societies rules) and they are not raping they are trading you. you trade them taxes, they trade you services. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:28:33
at a fraction of the cost you can get anywhere else, and with better coverage than private insurance would give you at any affordable price. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:44:49
if you are paying taxes and are living here, than yes you are part of the 100% who have agreed to live this way. you just dont fall in the second group i mention of that most of those 100% think its the best way we have now. you think its not the best way. 
and i have answered. long ago at the founding of what we have now as our society the people decided on taxation and that it was how everyone who lived in our society would contribute to it. the majority of everyone agreed to this and it was made into law. as new people are born they also accept this way of living by simply staying here when they reach the age of majority and are considered full members of the society. they can choose not to live this way by moving away. if you dont move away you are in fact agreeing to all the rules set down by those who have come before us. its the same if i choose to visit another country, no where have i explicitly agreed to follow all their laws....except i have, by my simply being there and entering their borders i have agreed to follow all their laws. its the same situation with taxes and living in your home country, sure you havent signed a piece of paper saying you will follow the law but its taken as a fact that since you havent left, you agree to them all. 
you benefit from all this supposed theft and yet you still complain about it. you use the water system, the sewer system, you use govt subsidized facilities, you drive on govt funded roads, you use all that you complain about. if someone steals from you that does not make it right to then go and use other peoples stolen goods, yet you do. if you knowingly use stolen goods, you are no better than the thief yourself.
there is no changing your mind no this subject. you believe to your core that the government is doing something comparable to you as is they were physically raping you. you arent going to change from such an overwhelmingly strong opinion. 
lets just stop here since neither of us are going to change our minds. you think im a blind fool who is being taken advantage of by being lied to and stolen from by the govt. i think you are the greatest example of a hypocrite by using what you claim is stolen from you and others while still complaining about it and also that you are someone who does not grasp the fundamentals of how a proper society functions and who has been misled by large corporations that they can do it better and for cheaper than the govt can, all the while they continue to take more from you than they ever give back as evidenced of their ever growing bank accounts. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:38:15
you dont need permission to leave your country, and if you are against taxation because its theft than how can you hold on to your American citizenship and take the benefits of every else who is being stolen from? that seems very hypocritical of you. 
if im being stolen from, is it suddenly alright for me to use everything that is also stolen from others? no. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:02:01
i think the govt is the only one who is going to make a road for the general public to use and then not hold it hostage with tolls and membership costs after its built. 
edit: for those who disagree with me, show me a privately funded road that is used by at least several hundred or even thousands of people a day that has no tolls or costs passed onto either the govt or the people who use the road. no tax breaks no anything.

6 will be hard because countries have different economic realities that result in different currencies. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:37:56
thats not a good comparison. 
the usd is far more stable. thats the only thing people really care about when it comes to currencies. when it comes to trading people want to know what they are trading for is worth what they are giving. with bitcoins that knowledge isnt there, tomorrow what i traded today could be worth far less than it is now or it could be worth far more.
thats to much uncertainty for a mainstream currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:44:17
as long as CC still charge a fee and a decent portion of the population uses them than bitcoin payers will still be paying for the CC fees. 
so if CC goes away how will credit scores be made? when i need to borrow cash to cover unexpected costs how do i get these larger sums of bitcoins? 
when i want to buy a car for the first time if i havent used a CC regularly than i wont have any history and its much harder for me to get a loan, it will be near impossible for me to buy a house without a mortgage and i cant get a mortgage without a long good credit history. 
none of that seems possible with bitcoin as the new standard currency to use. not unless we end up with a bitcoin CC where i can borrow more bitcoins than i currently have and pay them back at a later date(there better be a incredibly stable bitcoin price at thsi point because i dont want to borrow $10k usd worth of bitcoins today but have to pay back $50k usd worth of bitcoins in a months time).
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:35:40
but i dont need to be worried about bitcoin being surpassed by another coin. i just need to be worried about bitcoin not surpassing itself, and thats why its not going to be a good currency. 
you know what makes almost every physical currency a good currency? it doesnt take dips like crypto currencies seem to do all the time. a dollar a year ago is a dollar today, and its going to be a dollar a year from now. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:42:36
because the CC fee is built into the cost of the product. so no matter what method i use to pay for the product the CC fee is being paid.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:14:28
they use their local currencies? most currencies used by countries are stable with the odd exception of a few that are trashed by a govt doing something incredibly stupid. 
how exactly do you figure these people will get their bitcoins in the first place? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:44:58
they dont use the CC system for cash or debit payments but the price is the same either way. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:20:49
With what? No banks that the people we are talking about can get to. How do they get money online to buy bitcoins with? If bitcoins are bought with cash than that cash is the defector currency not bitcoin.

wife left him because he traded everything they had for bitcoin/bitcoin miners when the prices were super high. its now no longer high and they are super poor with no way to survive compared to before. 
he alone with his miners now.

as long as bitcoin prices fluctuate as fast as they do now it wont ever be taken as a global standard currency for the internet. why would i want to spend it when i know that in a couple days i will have technically lost money on that purchase because my bitcoins will have gone up in value? or why would i hold onto coins since i know that it may suddenly lose all its value?
why would i ever use Bitcoins for my internet purchases when the fees to use it are ridiculously high compared to the current methods of me paying online for things? or the confirmation times are far longer?
unless bitcoin becomes free to spend and it starts to hold a single(or very near that value) for a very extended period of time than it wont be used to actually buy things by the masses. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:42:48
its also completely free for me to use on the internet and in real life. so why would i use bitcoin over the usd when it makes everything i buy with it more expensive just because i bought it with bitcoin?
also why would i use bitcoin when who knows if the things i regularly buy are suddenly going to stop accepting it like many retailers and other places did in December?
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:26:03
unless bitcoin replaces everything than those passed on costs because of CC will still be there. 
if i go to a store in person and pay with cash im still paying that increased cost caused by CC fees built into the prices. the same thing will happen to bitcoin but on top of the already built in fee im going to have to pay an extra fee on top of that. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:50:00
was this when it was on its way up to the 20k value or after it peaked and has worked its way far down? because if its going up than i would expect more people to accept it as payment, after it peaked id expect few people to. 
businesses were taking bitcoins not because they think its a currency but because they viewed it as a good investment. they sell you something worth $20 usd today in bitcoins, but in 2 weeks they sell those same bitcoins to someone  else for $40. who wouldnt want to do that?
if the market isnt consistently going up and the last dip was recent than businesses wont want to use bitcoins. they sell you something for $20 in bitoins and by the time they convert the bitcoins to usd its now only worth $15 - any fees they also have to pay. 
bitcoin will become a serious currency when its value stops changing by more than $5-10usd daily.

dont some countries have several super computers that they could direct in an attack? and countries like the USA already have very large computer centers for things like the NSA. countries already have massive computing power, they dont have to create new hardware they can just direct already existing hardware to new tasks.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:51:07
plus its not like a manufacturer would say no to someone buying a shit load of their product. plus when the US govt(or any other countries govt) goes to buy computers, its not like they have to explain exactly what its going to be used for. spying agencies have huge data centers and computing powers and somehow they managed to buy all that hardware.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:38:06
ya but its not like you would know what the buy is for. the US govt announces a new data center for national security purposes. its building a 200M dollar server center and is buying up hardware for data analysis and other purposes. then once its built it does its thing. 
or they just use their already built infrastructure they have for things like the NSA.
