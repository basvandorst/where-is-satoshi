I was making a joke about buying the daughter. The way he worded it was that he bought he daughter, not bought his daughter Bitcoin.

Beautiful!! I hope to have a set up like this of my own one day.

I don't think that's legal

Not buying it for an investment, I'm actually going to be using it which is why I want it faster than 17 days.
Also I have used them for years with countless transactions. I don't see how a $5 limit makes sense at all. Five dollars..
Bitcoin will never be mainstream if it takes 17 days to buy Bitcoin. That's insane.

Not only is a 5 dollar limit way too low but there's a 1.99 fee. This deserves a "lmao". 40% fee. No thanks

Tried cashapp but it just says I'm unable to purchase btc at this time.
Bitcoin is ridiculously hard to buy, it's no wonder it's not mainstream. I've spent countless hours trying to buy it.
Coinbase put a 5 dollar limit on my card purchases (wtf), and to buy it with a bank account takes 17 DAYS! What!

Did they specifically ask you to provide proof of address? I don't think I had to provide that.
Peer to peer may be what you're looking for. Paxful has many options but be careful of the insane fees some of the sellers charge.
Also don't try and jump in so fast. I can see where you're at and it's not a good place and you'll probably get screwed. If you think the price of Bitcoin is hindering on such a short period of time that you have to buy it immediately (or you may even be desperate to buy it), then it's not a good investment for you. Trust me. There will always be good and bad times for Bitcoin, not just right now do you have that chance. Please don't jump in as fast as possible to try and make a quick buck.

Yep, but everyone jumps to Coinbase went down because of the price dip.
Who knows, there could've been some glitch or something and they fucked the priced themselves. Never know. It is coinbase

It's the new fork, it's the real bitcoin.. again.. for the 5th time?
