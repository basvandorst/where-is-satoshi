It's still not a proof but there is one way to get further. While Durian is locked in the room, the press issues a number of bitcoins that Satoshi should transfer to a different account to indicate Durian is not Satoshi. Now of course if Durian was Satoshi he could have shared the keys with a trusted party to fulfill the challenge, but now you have to believe the following:
Satoshi, who was a single entity acting alone (Durian), who has never moved or spent his vast sums of coin, has now shared the private keys to his vast fortune with another party.

Instead of campaigning to change the symbol you should campaign to add a B with two vertical lines to Unicode:

I agree 100%, he would have understood that. He is clearly very prescient. But yet he did post it, so I think it is thought through even more.
I think that if Durian's life is in danger, he is willing to step forward -- not to reveal himself, but to perhaps participate in a challenge to indicate Durian is not him. I can't think of a perfect way to make such a challenge, and a true proof may be impossible, but the crypto community surely has great minds for thinking about the best possible challenge.

Yes that's what I mean - vast sums of money, or move small coins from particular address that holds vast sums of money (not sure exactly how Satoshi's coins are allocated). Either way that requires a huge amount of trust on Satoshi's part, and the person he trusts must also be very competent in bitcoin. The challenge could also be designed in a way that Satoshi must demonstrate some aptitude somehow, so it's not like Dorian can just say "Mom watch the TV, type the amount in this box, and hit send"
LOL thanks for the spelling tip :)

Great pic but you've exposed your daughter's private key. Covering with a thumb is not enough considering the redundancy in the information. You should have your daughter move to a new wallet immediately or she will soon not be smiling like that anymore.
