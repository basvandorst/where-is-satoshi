Yeah, Canadian here too,.. I recall IGA from the late 80s- early 90’s in NS. Whereabouts are you that IGA still exists?

Cool article. What do you think we will see happen around sept 12? The author of the article suggests the world will catch up with what I assume to be some sort of significant change.

To be honest, this is probably more about preventing scammers than it is about shitting on crypto.
It’s rather easy to get someone’s bank info, buy crypto, and be riding off in the sunset before anyone is the wiser.
I had a number of BTC stolen from me in the past via a hacked online bank account sending funds with interact on localbtc. Not fun.
99% of RBC’s customers are honest, this will be a pain for those who aren’t out to scam.
I bet RBC will still do other methods of transactions in to and out of crypto.

Sorry, but I fail to see how this relates to bitcoin.

I’m just assuming that past performance predicts future trends. Also, hoping it goes back down so I can continue acquiring on the cheap.
But yeah. I, like so many others, haven’t a fucking clue where the price will go.

Thanks OP, very cool!

Is it just me or does Mark appear to have slimmed down a bit? Perhaps all that time he’s spent studying the blade is beginning to pay off.
