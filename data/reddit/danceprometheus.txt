well, it's a phone app mainly. People are still old school and need websites.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:52:00
What are the resources I can see for this? I have a current Lighting app I'd like to see if I can integrate it with.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:35:51
Interesting. What would keep it from getting mass adoption?
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:26:39
What's the likelihood of LN to be released and be successful?
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:53:45
Get one dude
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:17:23
Yes but you can get the van for Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:53:27
Install is 25k mv is 59k in dollars
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:54:32
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:54:45
I can wait for the day, we don't compare it to cash of any sort as fiat will be obsolete
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:15:40
Has it; it seems relatively stable comparatively speaking, lately, anyway.
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:27:44
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:16:50
Yes, individuals, but certain individual comments saying "Bitcoin will go down with the markets" were heavily upvoted by the community.
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:21:41
explain please?
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:10:10
Is it me or do I think it is utterly romantic 'he' is anonymous and the unsung hero we need?
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:21:01
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:08:30
you wont have gains without adoption
@_date: 2018-10-28 22:15:26
That's hilarious you put flat earther and bitcoiner together like they're synonymous when theyre not
@_date: 2018-10-17 23:21:46
most but not all
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:17:25
Here is a link to the comment I read about it [
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:29:59
I had no idea it was like that though till reading that comment. It's scary. Especially the part about the government can confiscated at any time and only accessible on Chinese mainland.
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:25:37
Speculative, yes, but fundamentally sound argument based on what the a new monetary system should and probably will look like and be based on.
@_date: 2018-10-28 20:41:51
Yes. But I don't think you know what I am taking about.
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:34:12
seems to work; i get asked that
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:13:18
I mention that 
| cryptographic developments |
I see Bitcoin as the original source though from which these are drawn
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:50:23
It's simply the evolutionary process that's inevitable
@_date: 2018-10-28 20:26:25
Bitcoin is your gold standard. The permutations and layers will give it the grease you need.
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:38:28
I live, I die! I live again!
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:20:53
This is correct.
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:19:50
holy shit
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:30:20
I'm using bitpay. But when I offer services for the Bitcoin community they say it won't work. See my prior post.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:50:32
How is that? Why couldn’t the creator simply change the code? And how did he set this limit? What mechanism?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:05:21


I don't understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:24:07
I am offering it specifically with $100s of saving when using bitcoin for bitcoin related services with my business and nothing. You can see my prior post about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:02:51
That's my guess too. Is there any other coin that can challenge it?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:33:21
Is there a way to short?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:34:29
Did you see the $200-$450 savings you get when you purchase with bitcoin on our bitcoin deals? Do you think that would incentivize them?
At what point does it become a currency and not an asset? If it is not used to buy anything then why is it valuable? I hear it is used to purchase black market things? Is that what it's mostly used for? how many transactions actually happen as a purchase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:46:45
I bet my right nut he's gonna back out.
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:01:32
Are you a miner?
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:52:54
No way! I am so excited about this next monetary system shift. It's frighteningly exciting.
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:52:17
Ok thanks 
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:00:32
Just a hard working guy tired of corruption, banks and governments
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:59:01
Yea, but that's just temporary and you're talking about merely the price.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:47:40
I'm with him. I believe.
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:49:05
I just learned about him, the Silk Road, and watched the movie the deep web. It is so sad he is in jail for such a long sentence, and just shows the lack of freedom we have in this country.
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:59:04
You think I am ignorant
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:18:25
Well, the network size makes it the gold standard. So convert to whatever fits your fancy. But the safe bet for sure is Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:55:32
How can us regular plebeians try this out?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:01:54
Ok, so perhaps the same few hands, trading the same BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:37:26
Unfair and insane.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:07:05
I am going through separation and thank goodness I have a prenup because of all the insanity. But still have to deal with making sure I am treated fairly regarding child support.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:09:29
I didn't get to celebrate with you guys the first time and I am celebrating now! Happy to be part of the community, though I bought high, I have no doubt it will far exceed the all time highs.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:29:38
I heard it is difficult to sell and get your money back. Do you have reassurances on this?
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:08:35
Ok, got it, but what else?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:34:52
was waiting for this gif!
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:54:03
I understand the value and efficiency of blockchain technology, but I don't know if we can equate it exactly to government backed fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:28:13
Until the have nots revolt.
@_date: 2018-11-05 23:56:53
This is perfect. Minus the John McAfee watermark
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:04:00
Ok. Thanks. Still appreciate any feedback here.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:03:03
Ive been saying it all along: "The value of Bitcoin is based on memes and genital mastication and abuse."
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:04:25
Interesting. But what was the cause of the termination of currencies?
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:34:09
This is what I feel cryptocurrencies are ignoring. Currecny currently and fundamentally is valued based on fiat and backed by the government. The government is an essential aspect of the value of exchange. The government can and will be involved and will be able to enforce at least policy and criteria. Consider changing the structure of a crypto, like Bitcoin, and making it Kensyean, removing the artifically set limit. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:12:43
Yes but I mean in reality? When can we start using it as merchants and paying for things with it?
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:19:57
How do we check for Segwit? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:29:32
I don't think they want that..yet. I would but I'm not their employee. What they would like is faster payments. Currently using banking it takes about a week. If Bitcoin becomes primary it would be much faster and better.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:18:00
Why not?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:03:39
I agree, but accepted by the majority of people and backed by governments at least. You guys are ignoring government. Big mistake. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:01:51
Thus, theoretically it is possible if everyone agrees?
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:14:19
What if an Oracle, (someone who is granted authority to make changes for Bitcoin), decided to change this?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:06:32
We did this with gold, because there is a limited supply of gold and use for it. We are arbitrarily digitally creating coins and then artificially setting limits. To me there is no value in this as we can simply clone the original bitcoin model until it becomes useless. Blockchain as a tech is valuable but I don't see it equated to real cash.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:10:20
I thought blockchain was a democratic autonomous organization (DAU). Is it truly democratic if every single person has to agree? It sounds more like it's fundamentally arbitrary and set.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:06:23
Soros is buying! 
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:24:29
My thoughts are, he said what he said about it being a bubble, while it sold off he was setting up to buy. I think if he does buy it won't be short term, but rather long based on a philosophical stance on it. But of course I am only speculating.
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:44:24
I have been thinking a lot lately that there should be a decentralized and truly global democratic political movement and outcome based on a blockchain platform.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:00:42
Why is everyone being compensated in fiat??
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:14:32
Based on his philosophy and theory of reactivity, I think he is setting up a position in favor of it at this time and in the long run, using his statement as game tactics.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:05:03
I agree. That's why I'm.just trying to do my part. I want real world adoption and think that's the only way we see this take off
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:10:45
I tend to agree with this, since you can't really solve the problems simply by increasing block size right? It seemed like a temporary cash grab, the same with the recent new fork. Just diluting everything and casting shade on the entire market. Let's get adoption going. And let's get a layer like Lightning Network on Bitcoin working well and trusted, using mobile phones. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:43:04
It's more delusional to trust in the current state of affairs, in my opinion. Yes, I do believe in this technology and asset is way better and more transparent.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:52:09
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:53:07
When I realized a year ago what Bitcoin is I wish I would've been able to get into it at the current prices. Well, here's the opportunity!
@_date: 2018-12-23 18:33:47
Can someone tell me the benefit of having a node, and also a lightning node?
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:36:47
What about the internet? I saw a post today about how there are attacks on the internet. Would this shut it down?
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:33:30
I am in accord
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:06:17
