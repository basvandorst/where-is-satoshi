How many jobs has Bitcoin even created?
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:45:43
The way you associate Bitcoin growth with bubbles is disconcerting.

How do you tie the identity of the participants to the information in the block chain?

I wouldn't call my cable/internet/phone/utilities provider "random" companies.
@_date: 2014-07-12 20:49:14
They probably thought it was a regular ATM.
@_date: 2014-10-11 01:32:09
So if people want to buy very expensive things like cars and homes, how does it work?
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:21:47
How does that work?
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:06:15
Somebody has to pay for it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:17:13
Bitcoin is inherently volatile. Everyone knows this.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:33:23
Should have called them Liberty Coins.

I think they are required by law to ask for this.

It will be 0 once a few early adopters with tons of coins cash out and leave everyone else holding the bag.

Why not? There is a lot of high quality porn out there that is worth paying for.

Deregulation played a big role in the crisis e.g. repeal of Glass-Steagall legislation.

Many people who do the ice bucket challenge also donate (which is what they are supposed to do). Because of the campaign, the ALS Association has [raised more money in a month than they normally do in a year](

And this is better than automatic withdrawals from my bank account / credit card how..?

I'm curious: how much did the ring cost vs the equivalent weight in gold?
@_date: 2014-09-22 03:51:08
Microwave oven.
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:05:16
Sure, but with Xapo you're also paying for the convenience of a debit card service.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:23:40
Could have did it without acting like a dick to the customer service rep.

You're surprised that people watch a public ledger?

Nobody hates the technology. It's the toxic community surrounding it that turns people off.

60 cents to send $173, GOOD GAWD!
@_date: 2014-10-09 00:18:12
If someone has 10 Bitcoins and the value goes from $40 to $30 per coin, that person loses $100 in purchasing power. If their coins go from $400 to $300, that person just lost $1000 in purchasing power.
@_date: 2014-08-07 23:01:32
Why spend when you can HODL and watch the value increase?
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:41:51


There is no incentive to. Student loans are federally insured. The school will always get their money.
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:55:47
Doubt it. Even Alex Jones had to admit that Bitcoin is volatile, and its crazy to hold it.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:39:14
Not sure what you mean. Back then we were on the gold standard. Those 49ers simply went to the bank and exchanged their gold for notes at the fixed price.
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:12:25
So in the cryptocurrency world, people who can't afford to pay for stuff can still keep those things?
@_date: 2014-07-10 22:43:15
Or a maid outfit.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:37:19
What percentage of your portfolio would that be? Seriously, don't dump all your money into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-14 05:12:41


@_date: 2014-07-15 01:57:55
More like everyone is afraid the value will shoot up after they spend their precious coins, so they rather hoard, err, HODL.
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:48:47
Dozens of people.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:57:41
But in that case wouldn't we still be at the current difficulty until enough blocks have been completed to cause the difficulty to adjust?
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:30:22
Or maybe they realize it doesn't offer any advantage to them.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:08:29
But it's not spam.
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:25:10
How is this supposed to work exactly? Everyone who sends me an email needs to pay the toll? This doesn't sound like a good idea..
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:03:27
But there is the *obvious* case of receiving emails from addresses you didn't white listed because you had no idea they existed.  What happens when a random HR person from a company contacts me about a job opportunity? They're going to have their email returned and told they must pay me 0.001 cents?
@_date: 2014-08-25 05:32:23
Log charts.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:00:06
You could disclose the public key for the address and then sign a message with the private key for that address.

Even if Snowden was on the list, nobody cares. You're just not that important.

Integer factorization and discrete logarithm are not known to be NP-complete. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 12:54:00
But that would take actual effort on his part.
@_date: 2013-08-25 18:10:17
Most people here expect bitcoin to become a widely used currency. It will not until it is way less volatile.
@_date: 2013-08-20 22:38:54
4%? So if someone has a $400,000 home they can expect to do $16,000 per year in maintainence? That's not accurate at all.
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:39:49
Its a nice way for banks to loan money at high interest rates.
