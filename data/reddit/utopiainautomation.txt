Okay.  
Last time I was here I talked how inflation is important in "encouraging" the economy  
and received a lot of downvotes.  
Yet when another guy was asking why deflation is better than inflation despite what economists say.  
He didn't get a proper response instead some person gave him Keynesian VS some other economic theory rap battle without statistics/logic behind it  
  
So ill just ask couple questions  
1.) Tell me how deflation/ 0% inflation is good for the economy.  
Despite economists stating 2-4% inflation is good.  
With logical reasoning this time.
2.) What is unique to Bitcoin?  Some (not all) cryptocurrencies are   
a.) censorship-resistant  
b.) highly unlikely to experience a 51% attack  
c.) store of value  
d.) can send and receive said value
So to all those who say that Bitcoin is going to replace all currencies or replace gold as   
Why bitcoin?  
Why not some other cryptocurrencies?  
Why not a fed-coin (but not controlled by the fed. controlled/mined/forged by private and public entities. NOT government. and private companies are subject to tax so that the public are encouraged to take part in mining/forging of said fed-coin)
Heres what we mean by "Bitcoin has no intrinsic value"
Houses and cars have the intrinsic value of you can live inside one or you can travel from point A to point B  
Now there are different kinds of houses/cars. What brands, and unique advantages/disadvantages. The cost of making one (There are those kinds of cars that you can live in). All accumulating to its intrinsic value.
Now to parallel this to Blockchain technology  
Blockchain has the intrinsic value of a-d reasons said in   
Now there are different kinds of Blockchain. Why choose BTC? Don't you think that it doesn't have to be BTC? if so why not?
Please enlighten me  
And don't send a crappy rap battle for your crappy response unless it has logic behind it and not lost its value/contextual meaning by trying to make word rhyme  
Thank you  
(I'm trying to save some people here who think that BTC will go to do great things because from what I'm seeing they set their expectations WAAAY high-up. YES Blockchain will do great things BUT how sure are you that the blockchain you're investing in is the one who'll do great things?)

Last rant post trying to convince people here. You may copy/paste this if you want. I commented this to someone and decided to post it here again  
my comment to some guy {
I have to add to my other comment
continuation on Inflation as cause/effect:  
Inflation is just a basket of things that compares its price for each year
It's not fully controlled by anyone but the market. The economic state of the country.
And the market follows human nature
Going back to supply/demand  
Every year, if the country is not in crisis and increasing profits/GDP,  
more people have more money to buy things. (demand increases. demand curve moves right)  
which in turn either/both increases the price or lower supply
Scenario 1  
When inflation sticks to zero as required by protocol/law  
Demand moves right  
which in turn either/both increases the price or lower supply (since inflation is 0 meaning no change in price) Supply will be the one to change. Supply alone. Creating a shortage in the long-run.
Scenario 2  
When inflation is approved just not printing any more new money (and assuming money can't be stolen/ripped apart which is now possible. except for hacking which is unlikely)  
Demand moves right which in turn either/both increases the price or lower supply. Inflation happens to avoid shortage (no printing).
This applies to every single thing.
See inflation is just a natural part of human nature. Just following supply/demand.
Without printing more money. Eventually, Businesses/people can't increase their price anymore. Which would go back to scenario 1
Shortage (Which I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want to happen)  
There are 2 ways that I think can solve scenario 2
A.) Forcibly move the demand side a step back to give way for more space.  
Instead of inflating the price. Reduce everyone's wages/savings (basically making room to lower the price while forcibly reduce the demand side for no choice of their own)
Just sounds like inflation but with extra steps
After making enough room. Only then Businesses/people start to increase prices
B.) Change the definition of satoshis.  
Instead of **0.00000001** **BTC** = 1 Satoshi (seven zeros)  
Make it **0.000000001** **BTC** = 1 Satoshi (eight zeros)  
You just gave everyone more money magically to avoid a shortage and allow price to move up a little.
Just add more zeros every time you need to.
Ohhhh btw ever heard of currencies adding more zeros in their currencies?
Yeah again. Inflation but with extra steps (value is arbitrary)
\--------------------------------------------------  
So you want to disable inflation with BTC.  
A promising technology with inflation of extra steps or susceptible to shortages.
That doesn't sound "better"
Printing money is giving room for more expansion on prices. As prices follow supply/demand. Supply/demand is based on human nature. To not print is to defy human nature.
And any policies based on not following human nature with its constraints (finite resources) is just a dream. As tangible/functional as the other policies/ideology that forcibly change human nature for said ideology (\*cough Socialism \*cough)
It can be used to kick-start economies by printing money (but not too much) It's a tool. Just like any other tool can be good or bad. depends on how we use it.
Hence I said (not here, it's on my 2 previous posts on BTC). That the BTC community should consider printing more satoshis coupled/based off on the economic state of the crypto community. Just like every other currency. Make it a protocol.
Because if you don't your just back to inflation with extra steps or shortage. Both of which I'm pretty sure none of you want.
If no one fixes Bitcoin someone will make a better one.

Aren't economics complex human behavior and not a machine?
There are many factors that play into this other than inflation
There are two truths  
1. Wealth follows a Pareto distribution  
2. Inflation is both a cause and an effect. Inflation is mostly used as an indicator of the economic state of the country  
So maybe they have high inflation rate because of fewer new businesses? (inflation as an effect)  
Phillips curve:  The Phillips curve shows the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment: as unemployment decreases, inflation increases.  
So maybe they have high inflation because unemployment is already low?  
note: \^  "During the 1960’s, the Phillips curve rose to prominence because it seemed to accurately depict real-world macroeconomics. However, the stagflation of the 1970’s shattered any illusions that the Phillips curve was a stable and predictable policy tool. Nowadays, modern economists reject the idea of a stable Phillips curve, but they agree that there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the short-run".  
My point is still valid since economists agree that inflation and unemployment are inversely proportional for "some" time. (you may see this not apply to dictators/Venezuela/war-torn countries because. duh you're in a crisis)  
Repeat "some" time for a few years in "non-crisis countries" then you would see that the average high inflation rate countries will have lower unemployment  
While the ones with low inflation rate will have higher unemployment  
Tldr; Inflation is both cause and effect. Inflation is just an indicator of lots of economic factors. It is not surprising you would observe high inflation in low unemployment countries while low inflation in high unemployment countries (Phillips curve).  
Im just saying (in the previous comment) that there are few people who invest in small businesses. Why few? because they follow human nature.
Follow the Pareto distribution (The wealthier the business you have the more you'll get investors. The smaller you are the less likely you'll get investors)  
That's not a surprise either.  
Inflation is just a factor and an indicator.

We have seen companies, projects, that look promising and yet replaced
Here's how I see it may fall
Social side
A propaganda here/there and ban in some government (which hinders adoption)
Technical side
Just convince institutions who use bitcoin to switch to this new "better" coin (which is easy. It'd be as easy as adding ETH wallets. Not saying ETH is the new better coin)
Convince developers/users to switch sides (because it's more convenient to use this new coin)
I don't think libra is the new coin. don't trust the owners but I trust the "nerds"/developers. If they could do it in more decentralized way (I don't know how since we all want safe/green way of doing this)
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:25:35
But there's a chance that some coin could takeover the immutability.
You could say that now but blockchain technology is just starting.
There could be a government/institution/organization that creates new better coins (fed-coin)
Look at "Libra" it already overtook all coins except Bitcoin in the market capitalization. It just shows how early Blockchain is.
All (whatever coin it is to kill BTC) needs is to convince people (not all. just a chunk of BTC users/developers) that this new coin is better than BTC.
plus the ability for it to be faster in going mainstream (if it's supported by a government/trusted institution BUT not controlled)
If there is a demand or more convenient/mainstream for another coin the Hash power and trust WILL transfer to it and reduce BTC to "myspace" of blockchain history.
Not saying it will happen, I'm saying it could
seeing libra/some government open to Blockchain.
I don't think it's far-off for a politician starts opting for Blockchain to record all of Government official's/projects transactions (and hence reducing most of corruption/bribery)
and later expanding it to the public and hence more convenient

You gonna send me a rap battle?
to explain deflation and why it's okay to experiment it?  
okay.  
Ill send you this  
Price of a product falls due to  
lower demand or higher supply
compared to 'value' of currency
Imagine a country used BTC as their national currency and the government let it loose.
 Imagine the economy of said country is going okay/well
 As prices fall (compared to BTC), production slows and inventories are liquidated.  (because the demand for BTC goes higher than the product of whatever that country is producing)
 Demand (of product) drops and unemployment increases (because the company doesn't need this many people to produce the new lower demand)
 People choose to hoard money rather than spend because they expect prices to drop even more in the future or near future. (because the demand for BTC goes up)
Note: this doesn't apply to necessities but this affects the price of necessity products as it will surely affect the majority of other products. (such as pizza, stocks, lambo)
Ie if there's a lower demand for pizza. lower demand for dough. So the company that sells dough is incentivized to decrease it's production and/or it's price (unemployment and/or deflation)
So then the price of bread (a necessity) has to follow since there's an increase in supply (if the price of dough drops)
If there are debts and loans on blockchain/crypto
 Defaults on debt increase (because of lower demand and employment the chances of default increases)
(There are crypto related debts. Don't understand how since BTC is supposed)
If there are no debts since BTC doesn't allow fractional reserve  
How can you encourage investors to give out their BTC if it has no interest?
(how would you encourage rich people give out their money to if it's just gonna return the same value?)
Soooo no or fewer loans then?  
Meaning how could normal (not rich) people start-up a business even if it's a great idea/product?
IPO? They'll sweeten the deal by giving up shares of the said business?
Banks lessen the risk through interest and only get the business if you fail and they want to continue it.  
This is much more creepy/unethical.
and hodlers withdraw BTC from slower ROI en masse (Even if the stock of a company increases compared to USD, If BTC has a better/faster return you'll just sell that stock to hodl more BTC)
 causing a financial meltdown defined by a lack of liquidity and credit.
  
And slower businesses
 How would miners react to stabilize the economy? Would they save the economy of a country they miles away?
All in all, a deflationary period is dangerous for a country's economy.
Now you'll say.  
People sell deflationary assets such as houses.  
Yeah. As their last resort. They'll use the (decreasing value) cash first.  
In this scenario.  
People might sell the house and afford to stay in a foreign country or rent.  
And come back after it normalized (normalized meaning value of BTC is stable)
[ 
I don't get how a deflationary currency used in a country can avoid this.  
As long as BTC hasn't stabilized. (meaning no sudden increase/decrease in demand like crazy)  
It will never be a currency.  
Inflation from BTC doesn't need to be controlled by a centralized entity. It can be done through protocol again.
like the blocks detecting the state of the economy and changing its inflation rate with it.
Why not?

Inflation forces all businesses/people to work harder.
"I would have a small seed fund I could use for starting my own business: except that after one year, my savings have been eroded due to the inflation"
I don't think there's a law where you are forced to save just let your saving be eroded by inflation.
So either you
invest back into your own business. buy more lands. open up more branches. hire more people to serve bigger customers. renovate and increase the size of your branch. Better your own product. produce your own tuna pie that would rival Jollibee (you work harder)
(I love their mango pies [not tuna]. If only there's a business that could produce the same/better quality with cheaper or bigger sizes I would buy those everyday *wink wink to any of those who are business-minded)
just invest in other companies (help monopolies?) (you don't work harder but you "vote" with your money and hope that whoever it is that you voted for does the work for you)
"Thus, inflation does not encourage investment: at best, it moves it from random new people to established businesses"
But there are small businesses that become big and included in your "high-risk investments" that people buy.
So you just said it yourself
Those people invest in a thing as long as it's ROI is larger than inflation
including high-risk investments (small businesses)
(and sometimes there are people who are crazy enough to buy into risky things. Point is it is their decision. As long as they understand the risk it's okay)
Hence for newcomers it is true they usually buy trusted/famous businesses but later on if they are confident enough (enough capital to risk burning) (or they see a business venture that makes sense in making money)
They will buy
No one knows which stock will win or lose. Jollibee right now is experiencing a huge drop in stocks. So even big business loose.
It's a risk
There are risks in starting businesses, saving, investing in a small or large business. Everything is a risk but
the larger the risk the larger the returns.
So I don't get the point of inflation = monopoly since it's just the natural order of things.
Large businesses already proven themselves to be safe just by being big. You don't know if the smaller guy can do as much so their riskier but if they become big they are huge (amazon/google of 2000s)
Most people will naturally turn to safer stuff more than the riskier ones.
Point is inflation is just a tiny contributor to monopoly. What's contributing to more investment's to bigger companies is just the natural order of things.
(Pareto distribution)
The more you have the more likely you'll get more. The less you have the more likely you'll get less.
Unless you get all socialist/communist leaning and "encourage" people to invest in riskier/smaller businesses
Hence it always fails because they defy the natural order of things. The complex human nature of things and choice. (not trying to get political. Just proving my point that it is natural for big businesses to remain big and get more investments than smaller ones)
In a zero inflation world
There are some people/businesses who would be satisfied with their profits (both the borrower and the lender)
I mean why work harder if they already accounted for the money that would last a lifetime?
Hence fewer businesses and slowing down the economy
Look there are banks/people who are willing to invest in small businesses. Granted they are taking part to riskier investments hence you would naturally sweeten the deal. (Pareto distribution)

Yeah they go up over time and still sell it BUT it's their last resort. They use the (depreciating value) cash first before homes/gold/classic cars/bitcoin.
Meaning homes/gold/classic cars/bitcoin are slower traded valuables
And hence
Not a good one for encouraging people to invest/buy homes/kickstart economy.
IF bitcoin updated to not stuck at 21 million and change it's inflation rate depending on the state of the economy that bitcoin is supposed 'represent' (well internet economy is not a country but a starting economy nonetheless)
Only then I'd see bitcoin as a legitimate currency and not just a store of value.
Right now all I see is bitcoin as represented by supply/demand and not much of the crypto economy (like I said it's only starting so I do understand)
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:45:28
Im saying
1.) If its gonna go up. It's a cash freeze. so meaning its a shitty 'currency' because why would you give away something that's gonna go up.
2.) If its stable or gonna go down. slightly. it's a good currency. Although  BTC value is based on supply and demand. not some countries economy status based on. So I doubt this. For now.
3.) If its gonna go down. Why use it?
4.) Bitcoin inflation rate is not correlated to its based economy status. (like I said in my comment above. The economy/country is just newly born. So maybe time will tell)
TLDR: Economists fear deflation more than hyperinflation because of cash freeze (slow trade/economy)
Here a video on inflation, Deflation and why small inflation is good.
More detailed example of why small inflation is good (stimulussssssssssssssssssssssss)

Bitcoin will never be a currency.
Or rather the lack of it.
Bitcoin has always been a store of value.  Why would one use btc if it's gonna go up? 
Btc has a crisis. Its called cash freeze.  No economic incentive to use the currency because it's riskier to use it rather than to save it.
This is what happens every recession.  Hence the fed (to save the economy) prints money accordingly that depends on the economics of the country.
The crypto economy, on the other hand, seems to save the price of btc more rather than the economy itself. 
Give me a decentralized cryptocurrency with inflation (print rate) that adjusts based on the volume and number of transactions per day/week/month/year.  Whatever that cryptocurrency is will surely be more of a currency than what bitcoin is.
Bitcoin is just a store of value and the current face of Decentralization and Blockchain Technology
 So if your bag is 90% bitcoin thinking it's market capitalization will replace fiat currency.  (Meaning 21 million bitcoin will equal the total market value of all currency)
I have bad news for you.  
So. 
Just invest in realistic projects. 
Although I do understand that there are only few countable realistic projects. the crypto economy is pretty early and the current gateway to it is btc.
Don't expect BTC will replace all/most currencies  
(a cryptocurrency could. A cryptocurrency that is tied to the economy it's supposed to incentivize. Not necessarily BTC. and definitely not a cryptocurrency with no room for inflation)
Even if the government wanted to.
The cash freeze is not caused/planned by banks or governments.
  
Human decision making did.  
And will always be.
