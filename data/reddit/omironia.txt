Having a cleric tell you whether trading crypto is fine or not is like having him tell you whether driving a car is fine or not in Islam. Or whether which fiat currency is permitted and which is not. 
Instead, shouldn't these "clerics" be updating us how zakat should be applied to cryptocurrencies?
Anyone can very easily be more informed than any Islamic "cleric" if they just use their head.

There's [BitOasis.net]( which is located in Dubai and you can use it in Saudi, but I'm not sure of their reliability or authenticity.
Otherwise, PM me and I can sell you (and others) litecoins (and bitcoins). I'm in the region.

I agree with you. I have started doing my best to only do online purchases/payments using bitcoin. It is so much more convenient and, at least in my view, more secure. 
As a frequent flyer, I can only use a credit card to purchase my tickets online as the airline does not accept bitcoin unfortunately.

So how much do they charge and do you have to supply any form of identification?

I'm starting to see a trend in people's thinking when it comes to bitcoin, especially among the older generations. It seems once they hear about it, they immediately think that a digital currency has to replace all fiat currencies in order to succeed.
Another trend I see, and this has to do with government officials, is that the first thing that comes to their minds is how bitcoin can be used for illegal activities.
Pretty strange!

You really think the only source of power and the only means for survival for the Saudi royal family has has been freely given away to private entities? Really? This is a ruthless form of dictatorial government that is terrified of any kind of change whether positive or not. This is a type of government that secretly and frequently kidnaps its own people to destroy any kind of resistance to its rule. These innocent kidnapped civilians never return by the way, and their families will never know what happened to them. This is nothing compared to what they do to their women (female royals included).
To be successful in their ruthlessness, the Saudi government also employs tactics using national propaganda. One of their frequently used tactics is "privatization" of national companies to show the people that the government is not in total control and hence not a dictatorship. In fact, they even sometimes label themselves as a democracy! This is mainly targeted at its own people but I guess it can also fool others like yourself if you don't live in Saudi Arabia.


I agree. And I already mentioned that these things do help but can hardly make a person rich.


This does not necessarily mean that what I said about the language barrier is wrong. Can you find any significant amount of Arabic news articles or discussions regarding bitcoin because I certainly cant. If you can't find any then maybe you should stop calling people ignorant and start looking at yourself instead. Oh I forgot to ask, can you read or speak Arabic?


Apologies for not being too clear on this. What I meant to say was from an average Arab's point of view, once he or she hears about bitcoin, the first response is usually that it is not needed. I personally own and use bitcoin and will be extremely glad if there's any kind of adoption in the Arabic world. However, from the looks of things, this might take a long time to happen.
The reason many Arabs are so dependent on cash is because they find it as the safest form of investment. This is due to their lack of understanding in other forms of investments not because of usury. In fact usury has nothing to do with how you spend your money. Furthermore, Usury is still a grey area and many Muslims don't agree that it is "haram". Are you a Muslim by any chance?

First of all, if I may, the meaning of "rich" Arab countries is that the governments are rich (most likely because of oil production) not that the people are rich. Although being a citizen of such countries entitles you to lowering your costs of living (no taxes, free education and healthcare...etc), it does not mean that every citizen will be rich. I'm not sure if you're aware of this but every aspect of oil production, from A to Z, is done by the government. The closest you can get to having a bite of that pie is to buy shares in a listed oil-related company or to be an employee in such companies. Even then, there are no guarantees that you'll be rich.
Secondly, just like most people prefer to converse and read using their native language, most Arabs prefer to read/watch the news in Arabic. Furthermore, most of them tend to stick to online sites and services that cater to Arabic speaking visitors. Therefore, when we're discussing the latest technology or anything that is relatively new, many outlets must use the Arabic language in order to get the message across to Arabs efficiently.
If you think the world's media services are not doing enough to cover the news of bitcoin, you should see how Arabic media NEVER mention bitcoin, at all! In fact, there's still not an "official" translated name for bitcoin yet.
Lastly, there's really no big need for bitcoin in the Arabic world (yet). Even if there was, you will need at least mass adoption of bitcoin in order to get most Arabs to become curious about it.
There are some Arabs online who do trade and discuss bitcoin, it's just that you're not aware they're Arabs!

It's a "useless" number when considering its direct effect on bitcoin price. However, it's a useful number as a spotlight on the big influx of new bitcoin enthusiasts.

Barclays Bank. 
I used to place all my orders through email but now that is forbidden due to "security concerns". So now there are only two ways to place any order: By fax or personally visiting the branch!
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:21:59
unfortunately no. Even if there is online banking, I'm sure there are extensive limits on transfers.

I have a Xapo Visa debit card connected to my Xapo wallet. I wire transfer Euros to Xapo and get to use the debit card for purchases in GBP. I can purchase anywhere Visa is accepted.
I also use bitcoin directly to purchase Humble Bundles and steam gift cards. I also use purse.io to obtain bitcoins.

Based on the long-term graphs, I have this persistent feeling that it will fall below $200. I actually have already started preparing for it!
