Tried adding 2 different ethereum wallets to the tracking list and they both don't work

"inavlid ethereum address try again"
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:21:23
Thought that's the problem too but the addresses are copied straight from etherscan and I checked for spaces at the end and beginning.

But the difference between a car and a horse is bigger than crypto vs Fiat.

I really think Bitcoin currently is more of a stock than a currency... I see some alts being used as coins but currently there's just no real reason to use Bitcoin. I just think it shines bad light at crypto as a whole. If the advantages of crypto will start getting publication maybe but till then bitcoin is holding it back.

No matter where you go, you need to use Fiat.. there aren't enough stores that accept crypto

With current scalability? No

With current adoption I rarely see any store accepting crypto. Adoption is far. Only way I see it happening if a big company or a bank made a system based on a crypto currency that people will adopt because of them being a big company. I see crypto only amongst tech savvy targetted stores.

Have you actually seen a difference between today and three years ago? In my area and country an app has been growing which is just a barcode scanning payment with online wallets like crypto but crypto is still the same.

I mean pos solves that problem

Getting people to adopt crypto will take more than five for sure. Ten if you are optimistic.
