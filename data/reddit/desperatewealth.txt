Did you look at the price today? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:51:40
100m satoshi=1btc right?

Cheers 
@_date: 2016-12-26 09:09:51
A-ha! Thanks!
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:53:04
You mean 300,000 bits. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 07:37:29
Oh, re my last comment - there are 100m bits in a coin, not 1m. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 07:35:02
Hmm. I'm not the most mathsy person, but when I do 21 million times 100 million and divide that by 7bn I get 300,000?

Coinbase is insured? 
@_date: 2016-07-16 16:01:56
Yes and then the 99% of people who haven't heard of MtGox then ignore the article. Please don't ever become a journalist. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 15:56:33
Give it up my friend, they are beyond help. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:25:58
Thank you for seeing sense!

The media does a lot of dumb shit but this doesn't fall into that category. He's an (ex-) CEO of a bitcoin company, so he's a bitcoin CEO. It's just a headline dude.
@_date: 2016-07-16 16:05:39
Unless they read the first line of the article. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 19:29:34
Yeah exactly. I'm sick of all the shit journalists get, constantly, from reddit when they're on a free to view website and they haven't even read past the headline. There's plenty of bad journalism out there but this is by no means the worst offender. Fucking incredible. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 15:58:06
Have you ever read a newspaper? The headline is a super short teaser, usually 10 words maximum. It's not the whole article. If you're interested in the headline's keywords then you read the article. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 19:31:34
Wrong. Accuracy is sacrosanct for any journalist worth their salt. You're reading the wrong news sites if you're consuming garbage rather than gold. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 16:01:19
There's so much bullshit the media writes about bitcoin and people here are arguing over the phrase 'bitcoin CEO' when the article then explains it further. Incredible. We're doomed.
