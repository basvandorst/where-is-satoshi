what about when I order 5BTC and customs opens the package
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:16:37
how to minimize my tax and how to cashout without risk of my coins being seized because i can't prove how i originally got them
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:21:19


it seems great to do that because then I have the money stored somewhere, but how do I spend it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:33:32
i don't feel comfortable holding these coins for any longer than i have to... i don't know anything about crypto and i don't trust that there isn't going to be a big bubble or something... what would be the safest way for me to lock in the value of my coins
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:40:00
it wasn't an intentional hold... i know nothing about cryptocurrency and don't want to have this much money in something i really know nothing about.. i'm poor man
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:23:37
So because I don't have the bank reciept from the day I bought it, will I have to assume I bought them at $0 and pay tax at the full amount?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:01:11
I bought them back in the day when you could just do a cash deposit into a bank account and they would transfer the coins to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:41:51
:D unless it crashes
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:05:19
where can you buy precious metals for bitcoin in australia
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:22
what do you mean? how is this different to using another exchange
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:05:12
i never sold drugs i was just buying weed to get high
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:05:58
is there a chance because i've mixed them now that they can just seize my money?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:17:34
then how do I get it out
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:25:37
if I get a coinbase account and a debit card and just spend directly from my card (each purchase under $10,000) then will I not have to pay any tax?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:18:44
I can't imagine you can evade tax by just doing 10 lots of $9999 withdrawals
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:02:51
doesn't this mean any person that obtained bitcoin illegally can just make this up? there must be restrictions to catch people
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:05:58
but yes i mined them then lost interested and found my wallet full of bitcoins that i totally mind for ;);)
does this story really work? surely this doesn't work
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:29:15
is that a certainty? you can get a coinbase account and spend as much as you like as long as all purchases are under $10,000 then you don't have to pay any tax?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:05:53
why is that safer?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:37:26
It's 6:30pm at night... I'm panicking because I want to get rid of these... the price is wild at the moment and I don't want to lose what I have.. I want to get rid of them now
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:19:24
then what do I do with the gold... I don't care if I have to pay tax
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:03:02
the police?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:23:23
that means I have to purchase something with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:10:21
can you prove it to me?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:10:59
then what
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:20:21
how can I be certain they won't seize my money... i've read people say after you've mixed them now the government can just say it came from terrorists or something because you can't prove where you got it
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:41:12
there must be an accountant on reddit that i can talk to and pay for advice
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:35:19
Seriously? So I just go to livingroomofsatoshi and do 10 transactions for $9,999 directly to my bank account and don't have to pay tax? Surely that won't work
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:21:04
Is anyone a qualified accountant or tax agent or something and can give me definite advise? I will pay you 0.1 bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:21:06
it seems great to do that because then I have the money stored somewhere, but how do I spend it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:32
im broke as anything... my bank account has never seen more than $5000 in it. you really think if I suddenly have $100,000 in it i'm not going to have police come and arrest me?
i am fine to pay the tax im just worried that they will say im a drug dealer, thief, terrorist or money launderer
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:58
but the IRS just wants the tax right? i can pay the tax
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:32:48
do you have any idea how long it takes to get a coinbase account? do you have any recommendations for me while I'm waiting for the card? I just want to lock in the price as it is now.
i'm worried by the time the card comes the price crashes, what is the safest way for me to store the value until then?
any advice here? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:13:39
hmm it seems like this might be wrong though. because you arent actually purchasing with bitcoin, your actually selling the bitcoin to coinjar each purchase, and then spending AUD... could this not be seen as withdrawing cash and then you have to pay CGT?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:14
wont they look at the history on the blockchain and see that i got it from a mixer and it wasnt mined?
