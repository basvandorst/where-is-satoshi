Accounts and sort codes can only be used to pay into an account, so something was missing from the story. It was also very convenient that just one payment was set up despite millions having access to the details. I wouldn't ignore the fact that there's a very, very high chance that this was just a joke for cheap laughs in his newspaper column too, considering the payment was to a charity.
A nice try, but you'll probably need a better case study for next time.

"The bank cannot find out who did this because of the Data Protection Act and they cannot stop it from happening again."
..was just grabbing the quote from that one as you posted it. That's the killer quote there. They can find out and they can stop it, but then that would ruin the joke.
(Plus it's almost 8 years old!)

They're making people aware that it's completely unregulated, you're entirely responsible for protecting yourself and there's a hell of a lot of risk involved, even if you know what you're doing. Calling it hypocrisy and acting like BitCoin is risk free is just pathetic - it's a genuine warning to prevent people from getting themselves lost in something they really don't understand.

If it's not priced in, are you therefore stating that the price will double when it happens? If so, why not keep buying if it's only going to result in doubled prices?
@_date: 2016-06-03 07:18:55


Exactly. The total number of coins isn't halving so there's absolutely no logic in claims that the price will double. Will the new supply being decreased increase the price? Possibly, but it shouldn't change it by much. Then again, it all depends on the hype. I'd definitely expect a dump afterwards though.

It's credit card fraud. Yes, some people may want to flog their gift cards, but on the whole, it's credit card fraud. The mechanical turk excuse always pops up, but can easily be dismissed by looking at what is the more common of the two; credit card fraud or people paid in gift cards?

You're being downvoted because you're suggesting people risk absolutely everything instead of cutting their losses. Sometimes it's better to take a 20% loss instead of risking losing it all.
Sure it may and most probably will go up again... but then again, maybe not?...

Maybe you'll have a few in those four groups, but I can assure you that most people are there for the people watching. 
The idea is interesting and I wish people the best of luck if they're genuinely interested in making something of the technology, however when a massive majority of people are fanatics who believe that they're the chosen ones who are going to change the world and become super rich with their tokens, then you can't help but laugh.

There aren't any figures as it's all hidden behind closed doors, however it's quite clear when people are literally giving away 20%-30% of their supposed earnings when they offer the discount on items. On top of this, why convert to BitCoin when you've then got to exchange it again to move it into a usable currency?
Also, what is more common. Credit card fraud or people being paid in Amazon vouchers?
Maybe there are a few people in there offering genuine discounts, but if you're seeing significant amounts off then alarm bells should ring. If it looks too good to be true, it usually is!

Do you honestly, honestly believe that Amazon expects to completely prevent people from selling gift cards just by banning this one site? Yes it's in their interest to not have people buy with the cards, but it really isn't the reason in this case. The bottom line is fraud, unfortunately.

Why would another BitCoin website claim that it's a scam? They want to promote it, they're hardly going to state the truth of the matter.

It's  and  of the options that you listed. If you've got a stolen credit card, losing 25-50% doesn't matter if you can turn the remainder into BTC.
It's a massive money laundering platform, although you'll see a lot of posts insisting that it's down to people being paid in Amazon vouchers and needing to turn them into BTC at any cost.

I'm not sure if there are any other 'neutrals' reading this, but this whole thread reads like a console wars fanboy argument. It's quite embarrassing in places. 
Of course (most) BitCoin backers are going to disregard any arguments against their 'investments.' You obviously don't put thousands into something to agree that it's got the potential to bomb. Then again it works the other way around with people refusing to believe that there's a future in the currency.
Short answer to your question is that BitCoin hasn't proven itself yet. Every argument is based on the potential that it has/hasn't which leaves everyone in a wonderful situation with very few facts.
Time will tell, but at the moment it's still a bet which may or may not pay off.
