Having multiple input addresses, takes up more admin time and longer to confirm. This is what i meant by it as it is hard to track what addresses you have sent from for a transaction from without going to blockchain.info

Actually there is time costs i have to consider and the margin of change that the exchanges change from day to day. Morrisons cards are to be added soon, however their will be charges added to this. Currently I don't have the ability to add on postage charges. The website uses mtgox as the exchange because of the software i use i cannot change the exchange it uses sadly. Mtgox and bitstamp have a 10% margin difference and i have to add this in when i exchange the coins. Currently bitpay and BIPS are having trouble integrating with the website. BIPS would of been my main choice but The CEO is doing all the troubleshooting and this is taking longer than expected.
Please also suggest other cards you would like to see.

firstly ebay in terms and conditions state paypal is only method and bank transfer is not allowed. 2ndly if the person who did the theift would have their paypal account frozen once reported to ebay. 2ndly the police will do nothing...been there done that. just get his address from ebay and then turn up at his door with a baliff. 3rdly ebay bans bitcoin transactions because it is a electronic item like an ebook which we all know they banned years ago. so if you do go to ebay you could mess things up for other sellers. but id think you should still get ebay to pull all bitcoin coins for sale

Currently my company is building a small exchange website which is totally hack proof and completely offline and the wallets only go online for 1 hour a day. It will also feature paypal payments and prevents panic selling.
