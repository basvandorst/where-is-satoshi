I don't know. [Back in my day...]( 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:16:14
He said the exact opposite.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:20:31


He doesn't. It's a way of protesting government bailouts which ultimately are paid by the poor and middle class people, while "the rich" get the profit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:53:52
To the people downvoting you: Whoosh.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:28:45
You're one of the few sane voices I've heard here in the last couple of weeks. Kinda refreshing. Thanks for that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:35:36
This might be the first time hodl is used correctly on this sub in the last few months.  
He typed that after the crash of 2013, when the bear market started.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:58:17


You truly believe. Try to understand.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:06:40
So about that ATH....

RemindMe! one week

@_date: 2017-12-02 12:37:59


Might be the bear trap. This might have been the first real major sell off.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:33:41


Could really be we just experienced the first sell off. So you would be right. Might even go up to 50k short term and then crash.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:09:17
It's really refreshing to read a sane opinion in here from time to time. The current bubble is toxic in so many ways and we really need to calm everything down a little bit. It doesn't have to crash, but there needs to be a correction, because the price doesn't reflect the utility right now at all. It's just dumb money at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:20:19
I get what you are trying to say. Nevertheless: The price reflected the utility better when it was actually possible to move bitcoins without getting poor in the process.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:20:11
Exactly, as long as we're still counting in full Bitcoins, we're not even close to adoption
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:46
I'm seriously curious: Why did you buy although you have seen the charts? The price was skyrocketing. Was it just fear of missing out?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:36:50
I would be happy for it to stabilize around $5000 as predicted a couple of years ago and lay low for a while. We're just beginning to discover the utility of blockchains (see Cryptokitties, funny enough) and Bitcoin is just not there yet to be a currency. There's just too much hype going on right now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:06:38
Why 6k?
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:34:21
"we're back on track"  
Now where did I hear this one before?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:44:08
Been waiting for this for quite a while and I'm excited to see if it really is one.

No, people think they are trading Bitcoin for Dollars on exchanges, meanwhile it's actually Tether. This leads to two problems:  
- Tether can just be "printed" by Bitfinex, so they could be able to manipulate the Bitcoin price.  
- If too many people start to sell their Bitcoins for Tether and start to cash out, the exchanges won't have enough real Dollars to pay them.  
We are heading for a classic bank run and second MtGox scenario here.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:44:34
"Back to normal."
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:14:57
Your point being that your charts correlate with the current price trend, right?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:53:54


You just owned yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:46:41


Prices/price signals are information. Banning insider trading is supressing information. How can anyone misinterpret that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:11:30
I think you didn't quite understand what I was saying. But that's ok. Good luck, you really sound absolutely confident and not at all fearful or as if you're projecting a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:12:44
There is reason to believe that Bitfinex is using Tether and actually doesn't have the Dollar assets they would need if their customers were to cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:38:29
Might even pull off the classic dot com double dead cat bounce.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:50
Nice description of the mania phase.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:38:16
Sincere thanks for that explanation. This actually really helped me understand. I'm not judging or anything, I'm just curious.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:27:54
Sorry, I wasn't trying to burst your bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:42:57
LOL, it's down again.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:04:14
The BTC chart looked that way in 2010, 2011, beginning of 2013 and in the end of 2013. And yeah, it got media attention, specially in 2013. This is the 5th beginning of the adoption chart now.  
Btw, that ad hominem argument at the end, beautiful. Really supports your point.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:44:24


Dude. That... that was 2013.  
P.S. Don't downvote a bitcoin pioneer, show a little respect!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:37
Or maybe it's just finally happening. That what everyone who is serious and realistic about Bitcoin was waiting for the whole time.
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:27:46
Yeah, so sooner or later all the servers and exchanges would be located in either Switzerland or Singapore.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:02:50






Yeah, but the problem is, if you buy at the right time, you can buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:57:53


"New paradigm!!111"  
Seriously, where is that adoption everyone is talking about. It's actually getting worse. Don't confuse media exposure with adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:49:09
I second that. RemindMe! 7 days
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:47:42
If you don't know when the "right time" is, the next best guess would be "now".
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:14:33


It did. It actually really did. But there were no inherent problems with the tech like those crazy fees right now.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:17:58
I'm not sure if anyone who is not able to use a simple calculator should even invest in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:10:09
"Hello, I'm a Newsweek reporter and I'd like to talk about Satoshi. Care to share some very private information?"
Yes. That is probably exactly how it happened.
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:40:24
Should have added a sarcasm tag, I guess. ;&gt;
@_date: 2014-12-23 09:43:23
I am pretty shocked your comment is just sitting there with no upvotes. Like almost no one here got the point that Ken Chenault was trying to make.
@_date: 2014-06-02 12:12:52
This should be the top post.
ABP is basically taking normal ads ransom and demanding money from companies to put them on a whitelist. This was a semi-big scandal in Germany last year: 
Adblock &gt; Adblock Plus.
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:15:16


No, but the point was: There just won't be bitcoin credit cards without any fees.
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:54:51


Yes, 1 month free credit.
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:57:15


No, those fees are not random, someone has to pay for that "free credit", don't you think? You don't pay interest on an Amex. A huge amount of those fees goes to pay for defaults and frauds.

@_date: 2019-11-25 07:27:40
That misused hodl shit and "best time to buy" crap needs to end. It doesn't mean you should just hold on to your bitcoins, it means DON'T DAYTRADE.  
Convert (some of) your fiat to bitcoin and just use it as money and stop caring about what the conversion rate to fiat is on a single day.  
On average it will be worth more in the end.
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:31:34
Thank god Satoshi understood economics. Unlike Mr. Fuller.
@_date: 2019-11-23 17:14:28
How about not having to fucking pay for your bank deposits?  
Which is slowly becoming a real issue in Europe.

@_date: 2018-06-22 18:40:46


Eh. No. The opposite. Clearly you have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:57:28


Don't. Do the exact opposite of what your gut says.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:41:18


Because everyone is expecting it to actually crash, not just dip.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:13:56


As they did in the 70s. And the 80s. And the 90s. I think they might have shut up in the late 00s.

You are really lucky to live in a country with a stable currency.

Kraken (API) is really bad. But I like cryptowatch.  
Anyone here using GDAX + cryptowatch?
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:52:51


Pretty much proves you don't have the faintest clue what the technology behind Bitcoin actually is and how it all works. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:08:44


Yeah, already heard that one before in 2013, so not sure if you're joking.
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:34:01


You started your argument with "I don't understand Bitcoin" and kept expanding on that. Well done. I would be pissed too.
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:51:43
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:17:28


People seem to forget that Bitcoin was all over magazine covers back in 2013 and crashed *before* MtGox.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:22:53


High five man.
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:03:48


Anyone with a basic understanding of the technology and economics knows exactly how those cycles work and when it ends.
@_date: 2019-09-11 21:33:21
Or just use it like ... I don't know .. real money? Convert your paycheck to bitcoins. Spend it like you normally would, save the rest?
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:33:52
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:16:52
Nah, that's not the pattern. Seems like you understand just as little about Bitcoin as all those people still thinking it has no future.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:38:23


Give it about 10 years.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:47:14


You'd have to be even more crazy than him to ever think otherwise.
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:32:21


Don't look at charts and unsubscribe here. It'll ease the anxiety even more.
