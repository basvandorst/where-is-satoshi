Yep. It's a geo thing.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:01:22
Can we donate to this? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:11:46
OK. Let's get gold, then we can regroup.

It can take 10 business days to get wires over there.

Please don't pretend this is anything new on this thread -- it's sanctimonious BS. From going through  r/bitcoin has always been about an obsession with mainstreaming Bitcoin and relishing the rewards of being an early adopter. First, it was through obsessing at whether or not a Subway franchise accepted it and now it's about the price and whether wall street will jump on board. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:05:04
Please take a long hard minute and think about why I would post this.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:28:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:07:21
Yep, debt is now gone. How about surviving for a year while Bitcoin appreciates?
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:22:34
Do you mine?
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:23:06
It's this kind of logic that made me sell all my BTC. Why do you think giant financial institutions (with whom you are not a client) are going to try and make you money and not try to take it from you?!
@_date: 2018-08-13 04:12:23
Why it was created has NOTHING to do with the price. It could go down to $1 and still have the same M.O.
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:24:36
When you invest a lot of time and money in something, it’s hard to leave it when things have gone bad. It helps to know others are going through the same thing. Best of luck.
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:46:45
From the tweets of previous attendees, something like 90% used to be tech and now it’s down to 20%. Not arguing with you, just letting you know how much this bellwether of an event has seemed to change.
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:54:05
As a layperson who is taking some time off thanks to Bitcoin, I find it helps — when I’m travelling or playing sports and the conversation of jobs and hobbies comes up — don’t be afraid to talk about Bitcoin. I always say I believe in it as a store of value that empowers the lower and middle class for the first time in a long time. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:07:59
The PRICE of Bitcoin should mean nothing to believers, Let it crash to nothing.
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:06:51
Sold all of mine.
@_date: 2018-05-31 02:28:07
I like your spunk! Unfortunately, it will require every holder to actually HODL. There is no mandate for individual people to HODL and fight price manipulation. Most people will have their breaking point and sell. That's why I got out before these institutions formally get in. I believe in the technology and its transformative ability, but I will wait until these predators lose interest and the price goes back to what it's functionally worth.
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:46:04
Well, you ain't a trader then.
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:45:30
Good point!
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:15:35
Thank you for validating my entire point. No one gives a shit about actual use. It's a speculator's game now.
@_date: 2018-05-31 00:48:32
Is Bitcoin the new gold or is it the new dollar? Everyone who wants the price to go up wants it to be the former which requires the market to be illiquid. Traders with quotas to meet and multiple homes to pay for will literally trade all the value out of the "Bitcoin is gold" people because THEY ARE 1,000% TIMES better at trading than the average Bitcoin owner. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 18:43:13
At this point, he’s a stooge.
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:22:54
Me too.
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:03:00
Everyone here is in trouble. Once investment banks even touch this market, they will trade all of you down to nothing. Stop thinking about price. If you believe in the space,  buy and use. If you just want to speculate, you will get eaten alive.
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:58:31
Why do people think that Goldman and the like trading Bitcoin is going to get you lambos?! These guys are salivating to enter the space to take all the money that is there from retail investors — not pump up the value of your coin.
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:15:43
I like this a lot. Just know you can cash out and the Nazis still won't win.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:50:16
Why? All signs seem to be that the crypto market as a whole has lost its allure to new investors. If Goldman and the like get in on this, it will be to steal the $400 billion that's already in the market through trading. The space is insanely toxic at the moment. I sold mine and will reenter the market when it's around $2000.
@_date: 2018-05-31 02:10:17
True believers are probably 1%-10% of Bitcoin owners, the rest are trying to make money on a speculative market. My point is if you are here to MOON and make $$$$, you will be eaten alive when professionals like Goldman come here.
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:59:26
Fine man. Trust that centralized institutions that make money off of rubes like you are going to make you MOON!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:16:50
How so? In my opinion, traders just figured out how manipulate this space for a nice $400 billion. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:28:49
My apprehension has been around for a while, but was reinforced by reports that most people at Consensus 2018 are investments bankers and the like, rather than tech and dev peeps. So, now it seems like a purely speculative asset that will be manipulated by the entity able to bring fluidity in and out as they wish.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:31:16
In reality: It's more likely Thanos is going to snap his fingers and erase the current price by half. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:05:00
There is way more blood coming, man. Goldman is there to make money and if they can figure out how to pour the money of retail crypto investors into their coffers my messing with the space, they will. That is their goal -- not revolution.
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:06:16
Dood, no. These are people who move their entire COMPANY to a different building so their DSL lines reach an exchange 0.000000005 seconds ahead of the competing bank. These are the same people trying to get in this space to take everyone's money. Just chill, take your money out, hopefully make the banks think nothing is here and get back to investing.
@_date: 2018-05-31 00:54:39
What situation is more likely...
1\) "Hey Goldman team, this Bitcoin thing could have real\-world use in 10 years, but it would also put us out of business. Anyway, let's dump our client's money into it so that some retail investors can MOON and sell their Bitcoin at our expense."
2\) "Hey Goldman team, there is about half\-a\-trillion dollars our there being held by no\-nothing retail traders.Let's take it all and buy new houses."
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:04:47
Novogratz said he cashed out hundreds of millions of crypto a while ago without understanding what it was. Right now, these guys are rich and hoping to be famous too.
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:57:37
Yes, but trading desks are not there to just funnel cash into Bitcoin and leave it there. These sharks see a bunch of goldfish traders that they can’t wait to eat alive. I would be more confident about Bitcoin if these banks showed no interest.
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:43:14
Sorry gum drop. I don't have to work for another 2 years because of December's ATH. It's going to be fun buying BTC again at $1500 \(which is what it should be valued at\).
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:11:56
In terms of the adoption curve, the innovators stepped in over the last couple of years and I just threw in a bunch of money (house downpayment-level) to be at the tip of the early adopters. I feel stupid having covered Bitcoin years ago for work and doing nothing. Will Hodl now while evangelizing.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:45:41
First person in my office to buy, now I'm showing the early adopters in my office how to do it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:10:00
The point was to create a record of the ongoing stupid ones rather than post every stupid one that comes up (which is every couple of hours).
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:21:23
Send it to me. I'll figure it out.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:05:08
Too many business journalists are led by convention and what they are told by rich investors willing to feed them information. For example, they propagate the myth that there are ways to "win" the stock market with a genius financial manager, when just pegging money to an index fund is the most logical and profitable thing to do. It's only after a crash or having their reputations tarred do they change. The only education in terms of crypto they accept comes in the form of tech pioneers talking about the potential $ value of Bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:18:20
No, I don’t want to be a speculator. Sold mine. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:48:50
If the OP is so confident in the future price, he should be fine with price crashing to $1000-levels so newcomers can get in on a reasonable level. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:20:44
Don’t know what “dox” means. I do know what sleeping in every day feels like.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:12:52
Beautiful. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:36:53
I don’t know it all. That’s why I took an honest look at why I was in this, if I would use it for anything outside speculation in its current state and I sold. I’ll buy back in when I need it as a product I will use.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:58:23
With pleasure! Put it on the blockchain! 
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:38:35
I agree.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:28:24
No, you are not getting rich off this. Sorry, it’s too late. Use Bitcoin or sell it — it’s going down to nothing.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:30:07
Why do you want the people responsible for Bitcoin’s creation to start buying it? You only care about its fiat worth. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:33:03
It’s fucking great. I admitted to myself that though I believe in the philosophy behind Bitcoin, it had become overrun with fools and bag-holders speculating on something they don’t understand and will never use. So I cashed out between December and May. I don’t need to work for a while so I come here to have fun with the people who gave me their money.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:59:59
What if I told you the actual worth of this thing is around $1000. Thanks for the money!
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:34:09
My schedule tomorrow: Sleep in. Squash game. Sicario 2. Cocktails to discuss the film. This is all before you get off work.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:08:11
Yep! I was super in to the space but came to a realization after selling most of it in December and reinvesting a bit in the crash that the whole thing has gotten so far from actual use and watching silly people pray for banks to invest so the value of their garbage goes up, that I exited. I have mining equipment I still run, but once that’s obsolete, I’m out.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:53:49
How is today feeling? Not so good, right? No, my dollars won’t be worth 18% less next year. Have fun being eaten alive.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:02:07
Numerous studies looking at the value of a borderless means of settlement. You’re fucked. Just sell.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:44:30
Sure. You do see everyone here say don’t plan out your financial future on this stuff. The innovators — people who got in 4-5 years ago — have comfortably cashed out. Your planning will rely upon an insane amount of money coming in from people with ZERO interest in making what you HODL more valuable. Sorry. Best case scenario: Bitcoin stabilizes forever at this price. Worst case: it continues to crash until $1000 or nothing.
@_date: 2018-06-12 01:08:51
Well, your description about how you used your coins describes why everyone should get out.
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:25:53
It if goes back to its use as a transnational way to send value, it will go down to these levels.
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:04:41
I don’t need to post anything. You and the other twit here want to immortalize my comment on the ledger. Exchange wallets between each other, idiots.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:46:45
100%. Let it crash down to real-use prices. Let greedy bag-holders bleed out if memes cloud rational thought.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:01:12
Maybe, but when the price drops to a point where it’s a product I think I might actually use and not just try to speculate on.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:33:22
Sorry for the delayed response. Was sleeping in as I have so much fiat from selling my Bitcoins to you I don’t need to work for a while. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:13:33
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:13:23
You are all trying to get rich doing nothing, not create a new financial system. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:13:48
I did. That’s what I sold in Feb. I’ll buy back in when it goes down to $3000.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:30:40
None of you use Bitcoin. You are waiting for magical investors to come in and inject their money in so you can cash out. You’re all fucking greedy bag-holders.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:24:00
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:54:25
“They let me browse reddit.” Sounds like you got the world by the balls. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:50:59
And yet, if you post any critical comment you get downvoted to waste. The space is giant groupthink. Get out. It's worth nothing.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:51:57
Then why are you all obsessed with the price? Because you DONT USE THE TECH and you want to get rich DOING NOTHING.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:52:40
Why would Goldman invest when you openly say you want to cash out on them? BTC is a powerful way to bring banks to people who can’t have them, bag-holders.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:25:58
Also, TBH: I was lucky to do what I did and I did it based on other people losing money. Right now, this subreddit is 850,000 people hoping someone else will buy their stuff. I believe in the idea of Bitcoin, but its current iteration doesn’t work.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:09:01
Makes sense. Good luck and enjoy the money of all these suckers.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:27:11
Bitcoin is worth around $1500. The rest is speculation. You are bag-holder, just sell your stuff before it is too late.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:28:26
You are very correct. It could be worth around $1500 as means of settlement across borders.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:03:05
I’m not salty, man. In 6 months I’ll still be sleeping in and doing whatever I want. You’ll still be working on a Sunday night praying that you’re not part of a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:18:13
Sorry, nope. The most I ever bought at was around $8.5K — which I was doing in the spring, reinvesting from selling most of my Bitcoin in December. Shortly after, though, talking to people like you, assessing the true value of the tech and being brutally honest with myself as to if I’m in this for money or real use, I decided to sell the rest of mine. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:27:05
So, his thesis is what? “Make dumbasses rich for doing nothing?”
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:36:36
“Spikes”? The age of dumbfuck speculators like you is OVER. It’s actually pretty exciting that the days of USE are coming back.
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:57:11
I sold 90% and you should have to. You still have a chance to sell before it goes down to what it’s actually worth.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:49:38
I'm pretty sure this guy pays to put columns in for his own personal branding. That's why Forbes disclaims at the beginning that they have nothing to do with this guy and his shitty marketing stuff is everywhere.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:35:38
Is it a currency or a store of value? Sorry, bud. Unless you bought in early, the golden age of this is over. Sell while you can.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:31:58
I did. It’s probably worth $1500. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:50:39
BTC needs to decide what it is. At this point, I’m with Andreas. It should be a way to bring banking to people who can’t afford it. It will never be at the ATH ever again.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:57:11
Hahahahaha. No doubt.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:22:58
I even have mining equipment that I refuse to use.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:06:54
I bet you wouldn’t know how to put that message onto a public ledger — that would involve actually using crypto currency. Just admit you are greedy and then admit you are being taken advantage of.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:19:23
Not really, No one outside of current holders have ANY interest in buying more. A new peak was just hit with $7700 and sell offs will continue again and again.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:39:56
I sold all mine in December and peak in Feb. I feel great about it. It's fun to watch the people who bought it.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:56:15
TBH: Selling is awesome. HODL-ing because of a Karate Kid meme is dumb.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:53:58
You know how he bought that car, right? He sold his Bitcoin to you.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:31:07
Run off scared? Sure. I made my money. Have fun buying dip after dip after dip after dip.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:45:57
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:26:52
I said put that specific comment (a screen grab would do) on a public ledger and you haven’t the faintest idea how to you greedy fool. Just admit you are here trying to make money not actually use this shit.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:31:05
Wait until it gets to the levels that Twitter experts bought in at! They will start calling for severe reforms on the system and to centralize it.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:03:56
NONE of you use Bitcoin. You are all here waiting for billions of dollars to flow into a product YOU DO NOT USE so you can sell it to someone else. The price will continue to fall until its actual value (determined by actual use) is found. You are all just greedy idiots. Admit it to yourselves.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:09:31
The problem is that 99&amp; of people who tell you to HODL aren't protestors, they're speculators. Nice try.
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:26:29
Don’t go too hard. You got to be at work in the morning.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:26:03
If you care about the price of Bitcoin, sell it all as fast as you can. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:47:36
Cool. Good luck. I’m going to the bar.
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:19:44
Are you going to post your address or not?
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:44:54
You just spouted every dumbass piece of BTC propaganda in one paragraph. Congrats.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:44:59
Don’t know how. Selling mine at a high price was sufficient.
@_date: 2018-06-12 01:01:35
The smartest man on the subreddit. If you have the chance to make 5x\-6x\-7x on an investment, take it because otherwise you're going to be dealing with the rest of the people on here praying that Goldman Sachs is benevolent to them.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:21:28
Bitcoin believer who sold all his shit after listening to you idiots. I’m waiting until it goes down to actual-use levels until buying in again.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:45:34
Just woke up. What is the current price?
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:49:19
It’s better than spending my time checking price all day and praying Goldman Sachs will pump money into something I don’t use, so I can sell it.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:39:23
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:23:24
You’re probably right.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:09:11
I like to visit the people who paid for me to do nothing once in a while.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:35:11
I’m not trying to be mean, but it’s the truth.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:30:40
If you are this sensitive about your BTC, you need to get rid of it. I openly say I love the idea of it but won’t buy it again until we get to functional-use levels.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:47:17
Hey man, you’re the one who has to go to work tomorrow morning. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:18:17
How are you set for life?
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:50:04
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:12:01
Get it through your heads: You don’t WANT institutional investors. Bitcoin is supposed to be the antithesis of big investment banks and yet all you fools talk about is begging for this money. Enjoy the fact Bitcoin is a fuck you to institutional investors or fucking sell.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:21:09
Thank you for the good, measured response. As someone who believes in Bitcoin, it drives me crazy when low-level investors (which is all this subreddit is) are planning their entire future on high-level investors like Goldman giving them money. And this whole time no one is actually using Bitcoin for what it was originally designed for. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:49:32
You’re the one going to work tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:04:43
Awesome. Glad I finally got rid of the rest of mine. Thanks for the money, guys.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:11:23
I’m sorry, but in early December you had the most prominent BTC people on Twitter saying things like “You are about to witness the biggest mass wealth transfer in history.”  What the fuck was that?
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:24:53
Every BTC head you follow has been in the space for probably 2 years at least. That means they bought for far under $1000. That’s why they are so ducking positive all the time.
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:54:52
I said I agree with the philosophy of Bitcoin, but it has been taken over by speculators, fools and bag-holders to the point where we need the price to go down to nothing in order to get back to its real core use. Unless you are OK with Bitcoin being worth $0.50, don’t fucking buy it.
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:46:42
How'd your transaction go, bag-holders? Or were you too distracted by every level of support crashing on this thing?
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:40:13
As I stated before. I have no reason to post my wallet address (it’s empty now anyway). These two guys said they wanted to immortalize my comment — they can exchange addresses with each other. I don’t care until this thing bottoms out of speculative territory.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:32:41
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:52:53
I can’t buy through normal app. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:45:28
Fantastic. Thank you so much.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:53:58
No. Need to buy now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:17:42
My pitch for the ad is a bunch of people trying to do everyday things with a piece of gold (like trying to put it in an ATM). Then at the end “Buy Bitcoin.”
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:54:57
It was an observation.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:10:12
This was this thread 4 years ago. It was obsessed with acceptance through purchases, now it's obsessed through price. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:54:26
Yes, people who are early adopters can look at the $10K price and say how great it is for them. You need the early and late majority to invest to start the climb to $100K. The problem is that those groups got burned during the rise to $20K and are turned off FOREVER. And on top of all of this, it is all speculation. No one wants to use this fucking thing.
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:11:55
Honestly, do you actually use this shit or are you hoping someone pays more for it than you did so you can sell it? Chump.

Sorry, mate. The majority of potential investors got burnt and ain’t coming back. You do understand the price needs to go up like 500% just to get back where it was?
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:32:46
Thanks for admitting you don’t even want to use the fucking thing for what it was designed for. Your stated goal is to sell BTC for more than what you paid for it. Sorry, mate, sound money has looked at you and decided you are a chump.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:41:13
Classic bag-holder. I've spent the year travelling and fucking around because you bought all my Bitcoin between December and Feb. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:21:07
None of you actually use this shit. Glad I sold all of mine when it was 3x  the price this fuck is bragging about;
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:36:44
How goes your BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:13:35
I didn’t know I was speaking to a fucking Winklevoss! Can I use your fucking lawyers and bank connects to draw up the short? Listen chump: Sell your BTC and buy it back when it crashes to nothing.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:01:31
The price is where it's supposed to be based on non-mania expectations from last year. We're looking at $25K by EOY. Thanks, bye.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:35:16
How goes your BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:19:18
Chump. I'll see you at it's functional price -- probably around $1,000. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:25:03
"Stable BTC at 1000 would be fine with me" -- Yep, let the price crash (and your assets) another 80%. Fucking chump.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:19:22
Look. Housing is way too expensive across every country on earth -- it's not because of Jews (again, I am Jewish). I hope that Bitcoin can be liberating because we can start putting $500-$50k into a secure investment without being bound to a house that makes everyone a money-making servant for their bank.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:33:08
I never said it would be a safe haven. Stocks are not safe havens. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:15:59
My point is that the Bitcoin front page is filled with people saying that Bitcoin will rebound soon. As I believe there is going to be a drastic stock downturn, we need to expect the rest of the Bitcoin downturn to be worse. In the period that follows the crash, we need to make arguments as to why people getting back into investing should choose BTC over the stocks that collapsed.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:20:02
My point, is that Bitcoin could be a better store of value than a home for most of the population.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:23:59
All I'm saying is that a stock market fuelled by marketing over numbers is crashing with the top dogs cashing out (and it looks like BTC knew this before anyone). It's going to be really bad and in the next 24 months, people might have the opportunity to see BTC as an alternative in a more potent way.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:37:04
Listen to yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:28:02
You just said you keep fucking buying while it crashes. It is going to $1,000 at best or $0 at worst. Hence, you're a fucking chump.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:23:22
Unless you are planning to live in one place your ENTIRE life, a home purchase is a huge burden given insane prices.
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:21:20
Congrats, man.
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:37:58
I already ACTUALLY profited to the tune of 400% by selling all of mine while fools like you were buying. You haven't profited at all as you haven't sold your fucking BTC, idiot. Also, no one here knows how to short anything -- it's a fucking propaganda term used to make bag-holders feel better about the fact no one with money wants anything to do with BTC anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:34:18
I'll let the rest of the Jews know your place is off-limits.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:39:35
Also, banks don't give out credit for homes out of some sense of community, they know that for the first 4-5 years you are just paying them interest money and not paying off your home. Then after that, you have one job loss or sick family member and they get the fucking thing back. And all this while, you are maintaining and paying taxes on THEIR property.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:30:28
Ask anyone below 35 if they have the $40K needed to make a downpayment on a $200K house (these are Canadian regulations) without getting money from baby boomer parents. Bitcoin can offer a place to put incremental amounts of income without dedicating their entire lives to a home that requires constant re-investment to maintain its value.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:36:02
That's not what I said. We are in a market where a car company that sells 70,000 cars a year is valued more than one that sells millions. Moreover, no one wants to say why there is this selloff. My guess would be a massive default looming on international consumer debt. When this crash (stocks) bottoms out in a couple of months or possibly the end of the year, there is room for a full discussion on the best way forward.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:26:20
Also, home ownership is insanely rigged toward the bank. You have any kind of life hiccup (which will happen), no matter how much money you have invested in your house, you get foreclosed on. Renting, you move to a friend's house until you get back on your feet.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:33:44
As a previous homeowner, this was my choice as well.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:27:47
It's too fun to see this real-life community of bag-holders try to rationalize negative facts.
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:54:37
The old Bitcoin exchange used to be there.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:47:16
Fork is happening while I'm away so I would like to have access to it in case I want to put in exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:21:17
I'm presenting Bitcoin as a better store of value for their money than most of the country who sees a home as their main and only asset.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:59:01
Prepare to have your mind blown: I'm Jewish.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:47:48
Do you guys travel to foreign countries with your wallets? I was thinking of just giving to a friend.
@_date: 2018-07-15 20:06:57
Listen to you all discussing what price you will get "out at." This is insane. Use the tech or don't buy. There are no more fools.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:31:06
Got it :) Not even talking about overperforming. I'm talking about investments I've had and built for years, and Bitcoin just surged past them!
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:10:21
Fuck the bank!
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:29:47
There is a theory this is related to larger initiative to contain the fallout of a looming, insane credit bubble burst. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:20:06
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:53:43
Not trying to be an asshole: You rich? I'm getting rich. I believe, from the numbers, entire generations are being fucked over by tuition fees  and not having access to a crazy bull market.

Backseat on a catamaran.

They are already borrowing money. This is a hedge.
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:25:03
Thank you for agreeing. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:51:56
Too bad TD banned buying crypto on its cards in Feb. -- classifying it as an unsafe purchase you were not allowed to make.
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:37:22
That’s what student loans WERE supposed to be for. Now they are a cash cow for lazy financial institutions preying on people whose brains haven’t developed yet. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:22:03
I think you will agree, then: Every college student should take 10% of their loan and buy Bitcoin. Correct?
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:41:08
Sorry, I thought you were being a fucking idiot saying people don't "invest" with borrowed money. If there are students out there with the option to invest and get away with it like a rich person, why shouldn't they?
