Haha yeah, waiting for the Dip to get more
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:07:33
big if true
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:37:42
I must admit, I almost sold half... then didn't, because fuck it, I'm seeing this through.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:27:50
My thoughts are that you should do your own research and stop looking for free content for your story.

a drop in the ocean

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:25
Haha, bought at $10,000 after years of wanting to do so, buying a little more of BTC ETH and LTC each week, always hodling, never stressing. Crypto is entertaining af, who the hell needs tv or videos games when you're in crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:58:22
Not with futures coming in dude.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:16:53
Does this affect Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:00:53
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:23:05
Looking forward to the next, my fiat is ready

Wow, fuck them.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:13:59
question is, how far does it dip?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:32:28
Can the hardware on a Trezor fail out of interest?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:18
no fucking way, this is unbelievable
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:19:18
Considering selling my ETH with the problems, and putting it into BTC, anyone done this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:25:21
Wow, how many years of business school did he complete to come up with that totally unique view?

top quality photoshop there squire
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:38:51
You're kidding, right? People should just give you money? Why?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:33:05
Many don't want to hear it, but this could be the death of Bitcoin. For god's sake don't pour your money in, only what you can afford to lose. People won't touch it if it's made illegal in major countries.

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:46
Where do they frequent, out of interest?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:17:32
can't buy any?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:53:25
Fist yourself, anything written will be twisted to FT's agenda
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:07

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:31:14
