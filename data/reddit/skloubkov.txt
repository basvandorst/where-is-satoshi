Ok, it looks like you are confusing transaction hash, public address and transaction input/output.
Your public address doesn't "hold" bitcoins, it has associated transaction outputs. When you send bitcoin, you give away those transaction outputs to someone else.
Your public address isnt used as part of transaction.
So, when someone sends 1 BTC to 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ what really happens:
- Transaction "7e621eeb02874ab039a8566fd36f4591e65eca65313875221842c53de6907d6c" is created with output to address 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ 
Now when you send 1 BTC to someone else, you are literally telling:
- use output that was sent to me from transaction 7e621eeb02874ab039a8566fd36f4591e65eca65313875221842c53de6907d6c and send it to 1NFq92ve9VHUqAARobLZPxsPNRMMv4RPGg". This operation will generate a new transaction "6749762ae220c10705556799dcec9bb6a54a7b881eb4b961323a3363b00db518"
So at this point, 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ  has no associated outputs and 1NFq92ve9VHUqAARobLZPxsPNRMMv4RPGg has "6749762ae220c10705556799dcec9bb6a54a7b881eb4b961323a3363b00db518" valued at 1 BTC
When 1NFq92ve9VHUqAARobLZPxsPNRMMv4RPGg sends BTC back to 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ, it means
- send my previous output from 6749762ae220c10705556799dcec9bb6a54a7b881eb4b961323a3363b00db518 to 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ" this will generate transaction "1b24cec4ce0519df028af441934f161c3fdbc6bbf611d33ff39e0b68f03cb0f1"
So after all this address 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ will have 1 output valued at 1 BTC from output "1b24cec4ce0519df028af441934f161c3fdbc6bbf611d33ff39e0b68f03cb0f1"

Inputs of the transaction are one of the constants. (output script is constant too but a little trickier).
Each input also comes with a script but that can be changed while keeping transaction signed.
If you only use input+input.Vout you ignore elements that can be changed and get "unique id".
Those inputs cant be changed (either values or order) because it invalidated the signature of transaction.
So my idea generates unique transaction id. (technically not unique since its a hash, however collision chance is 0 for practical purposes)

Bingo! You are welcome.

Yeah understand that, what I am asking however is:
If I send a transaction that uses 4 inputs, and 1 output. Is there a way where someone could take that transaction, break it into 'n' separate transactions?
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:52:15
From what I understand, inputs, and their order are part of the transaction that gets signed. By changing order, you invalidate the signing.
Problem with malleability is that part of the transaction that wasnt signed is modified, so signature is valid, while generating different hash aka transaction.

When you are sending bitcoin, you are using outputs that were previously sent to you. So actual transaction would look like this:
Someone sends 1 BTC to Alice
- Transaction with hash "A", output "0" value of 1 BTC  is sent to 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ
Alice sends 1 BTC to 1NFq92ve9VHUqAARobLZPxsPNRMMv4RPGg
- New transaction hash will be "B", use "A:0" as input, and have output "0" value of 1BTC to 
Now that address sends money back
- New transaction hash will be "C", use "B:0" as input and have output "0" value of 1BTC to 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ
So even though you ended up with 1 BTC at the end (minus fees), you don't really have the same bitcoins (you started with A:0, ended up with C:0).
Those hashes are SHA 256 and not single characters, with chances of collision so low that it can be ignored.
Hope this helps

Sweet, pretty similar direction.
Thanks!
