What? When did Donald Trump start posting in @_date: 2017-08-17 10:28:03
I think it's important to have diverse sources of news. 
The top moderator of this forum is the same person who owns and controls bitcointalk.org.
You should seek different perspectives elsewhere. This place is heavily modera_ted and cens)ored. Like, you are being gas-lighted right now, basically.

So, which of those is not owned by thermos?

Because it isn't what I create, it's what people will support. If I fork bitcoin/bitcoin that doesn't help this situation one bit. There are several well established teams that have already done this, and there's no way I would be able to do a comparable job to any of the top 3 or 4. I review code when I have time and try to see the best path forward based on sentiment from different areas. That's how I contribute. The old "well it's FOSS so go make a better Bitcoin" line really doesn't make any sense. This isn't angry birds. It's a currency protocol that requires adoption to have value.

This UASF fiasco has cost us another month of not working on a flag day upgrade to 2MB + SW or a safer version of EC in core + 4MB + SW.
you need to test the waters around support for a flag day upgrade + SW that increases the blocksize a bit at the same time. The first step is to gauge community support. If you can help implement an accepted version of EC (or at least come to consensus around the AD parameter - which always felt like flippers on a horse to me), that would be even better.
No one wins if Bitcoin stays at 1MB. Except @ coins. A few of the alts are actually interesting and deserve their spot, but when I see some of the alts gaining on Bitcoin it makes me furious how stupid people are.
Get behind a flag day upgrade + SW and a blocksize increase. Or SW + EC and a 2 or 4MB cap. That's the best thing for Bitcoin.

B-U has more support than SegWit as a soft fork with no blocksize increase, unless you are measuring support in units of unicorn farts and Sybil attacks.
Also, you are conflating things that should not be conflated, which is the root of the problem.
I support SegWit with a hard fork blocksize increase. I do not support SegWit as a "soft fork" with no blocksize increase and changes to the cost of signature data to make it 4x less expensive to store.
There would be massive support for a hardfork/flagday of SegWit WITH a blocksize increase (probably to 4MB at this late stage of the game)

No it isn't, although a lot of the people who were interested in what Bitcoin does have left. They'll come back for BCC though.
If BTC doesn't scale when the users want scale, and BCC does, BCC will overtake BTC by demand, and that is a good thing. It's competition. Forks are a good thing.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:36:01
Are you suggesting we should power our cryptocurrency with twitter polls, sybil nodes, and trolling?
Great idea, we can call it HashCashCoin ^TM. Bitcoin extended with vaporware, bribes, character assassination, narrative control, and stalling. Brilliant.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:42:10
I've read the code, both of you are lying and spreading propaganda.
If I am wrong and you are not lying, I will apologize when you link the code on github that steals coins and spies on you, as well as the bugs with the replay protection.
If I am not wrong, why are you misleading people? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:26:49
Those sounds like great things for you to research using a search engine and then tell that development team about confidentially until they can address any issues you find. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:54:36
Yeah, typically you find the hash (SHA256 usually but some schmucks still use MD5 which has collisions and is compromised) of the release you downloaded and compare that to the hash that the development team shared when they published the release. 
I'm not a developer of a Bitcoin ABC client, so you'll want to ask the development team that created the client you plan to download and use.
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:29:45
Ok, what is your methodology for determining what "Bitcoin" should be that is better than the chain with the most proof of work?
You've described a scenario where a state actor decides to put tremendous resources into an attempt to destroy Bitcoin. I would love to hear your version of "Bitcoin" that does not use proof of work yet is better protected from this same scenario, or do you just enjoy coming up with problems but not solutions?
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:34:36
I'm not defending ABC.
I'm simply pointing out that your statement:


is incorrect because there are plenty of viable alternatives used today. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:09:28


They why isn't the job getting done??? Why is capacity still stuck at 2.3 transactions per second?
Efficient code? More like vaporware and snake oil. Where are these "L2 solutions"? They don't exist and those that do are not Bitcoin, but hub systems (banks).
I don't think you understand Bitcoin very well.
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:38:31
"L2 Solutions" are bullshit. The ones that do work change the properties of Bitcoin in ways where actual users of Bitcoin won't want to use them. I don't really feel like hearing the same narratives and talking points from you about SegShit. We'll see where BTC and BCC are in a year, when I'm still building stuff with cheap, scalable, peer to peer Bitcoin and you are cheerleading for a piece of @ corporate KYC bank-coin that doesn't work, requires ID checks, and is expensive.
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:08:52
How are you planning on measuring what "regular people care about". What are "regular people"? How do you know what they care about is "being able to spend heir coins anywhere they go." whatever that means? How do you quantify "very, very wide userbase"?
What a steaming pile of horse crap.
Proof of work is what Bitcoin uses to prevent counterfeiting and determine the longest chain. It's based on math and cannot be faked. If a chain split of Bitcoin with the same proof of work function overcomes all others in hash power / difficulty, that *is* Bitcoin. 
Arguing anything else is political BS.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:00:42
I don't think dumping BCC will matter. There is plenty of money willing to take a bet on BCC vs BTC. My money is on DDOS, hash power attacks, and whatever other black ops. We are already seeing the astroturfing and social media attacks on twitter and reddit, plus the usual talking head shills attacking the idea. I think they are having trouble because it doesn't have a "Roger Ver" or "Jihan" to assault, as they are both still honoring the NYA agreement and SegWit2x.
Another prediction, if BTC can't get on board with bitcoin as p2p electronic cash and abandon science experiments with "l2 solutions", BCC is going to overtake BTC. 
Right now, what I am hearing and seeing with BCC is much closer to the spirit of what got me excited about Bitcoin years ago. Adam B. droning on and on about things that don't exist as solutions to immediate problems and making every conceivable excuse to stall scaling bitcoin has gotten old. People aren't stupid, and they aren't going to back a cryptocurrency that's being used like a roll of toilet paper by a for profit company that was funded by giant insurance companies and banks.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:26:44


That's hilarious. Have fun holding the bag.
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:56:32
I believe in POW until someone can demonstrate a better way, and I think those who are blocking scaling in lieu of vaporware are scum. I'm through waiting. Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:33:40
Absolutely, if miners put more hash power on your fork and users buy so much of your Bitcoin that it overtakes the original, congratulations that's Bitcoin.
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this here, but you should read the Bitcoin whitepaper. 


able   to   allocate   many   IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:17:48
I disagree.
If Bitcoin Cash achieves more hash power and a higher market price that Bitcoin, then it *is* Bitcoin. Until then, calling it Bitcoin Cash is fine. Bitfinex's statement seems partisan to me. The decision to fork on such short notice was to reduce the risk of organized opposition from well funded special interest groups. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:59:20
The thing about Moore's Law is that storage is more than 20 times cheaper in 2017 than when we put the 1MB limit in in 2010.
Storage capacity doubles every 18 months. 40x is only 5 or 6 doublings from 8MB. By your own statement, we'll have Bitcoin Cash ready for mass adoption in 7.5 years. 
That works for me. Sure beats listening to Adam Back talk about vaporware for another 3 years while letting Bitcoin die a slow death.

Wrong. There are lots of alternatives for creating reproducible builds, and it certainly doesn't have to be "Core's" build process:  
This rings of an attempt to brand Bitcoin Core's software as safer by spreading FUD about release processes. If there is a specific issue or vulnerability with the way Bitcoin ABC is releasing versions, the right thing to do is to notify them and practice responsible disclosure, not come here and spread FUD to people on social media forums. I'm tired of this type of two faced, unethical behavior running contrary to FOSS. If you see an issue, notify the team and do the right thing.
