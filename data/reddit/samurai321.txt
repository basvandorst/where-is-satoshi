thanks, tp, the website you were talking was called bitcoinbuilder. i didn't use it because it seemed shady. And there is a precedent of exchanges freezing some portion of users money and promising to eventually pay it back with the fees. check [vircurex]( , however their monthly payments became annual payments since the trade volume dwindled and the site seemed unsafe ....
That said, you are on point that there is nothing wrong with exchanges releasing debt to raise capital or to bail-out-themselves, just like banks have stocks, apart from the trading with insider information and being non-compliance in some jurisdictions...

i mean taxes in general, they will worry more about you laundering money. As long as you keep your proffit in btc the trading won't be taxed, bitcoin are taxed in the same way currency exchanges are taxed in your country, usually after profits are made.
Now if the people you are selling your bitcoins to are using them to launder money, it gets tricky, you are obliged by law to deny any transaction if the funds origin or destination is illicit.

other miners will need to download your fork, let's say it's called bitcoin+... then they could read on the source code that it allows you to create coins or some other trick.  Please read the history of btc, actually someone found a bug that allowed to create more bitcoins due to a stack overflow or something, it was fixed by satoshi with a update of the bitcoin software that was in fact a hard fork.  back in the day it was called mandatory update.

still, you are creating a new fork, the original software won't ever chain more blocks to a block that doesn't follow the rules.

pruning is a half backed patch. What we need is that the UTXO set hash gets posted on blocks periodically. Once we found a way to do consistently for al operating systems and miners make it obligatory for miners to check its validity and from there the user only have to choose how deep they trust this hash is safe, say a reorg of blocks 1 month old it's unlikely, so i will just download the blocks from the last month and then request a UTXO as it was 1 month ago from one of the peers.

yeah, it may be simpler to just require proof when you receive a transaction. Wallets should need to have only proof of their coins, not the whole blockchain, the full nodes will store the whole blockchain and the peers just a subset of it.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:24:09
The core of the problem is in everyone listens to everyone's TX, that isn't scalable. Only miner's pools should do that and then finance themselves with a pool fee.

@_date: 2015-06-19 12:57:32
there are many! you just need more engineering. 
before it was only economical to do a double spend if there are big amounts, now it's trivial. People were not accepting 0 conf for &gt;1btc payments. Are you blind. ? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:28:40
But you can only double spend if either:
-I pay a miner
-I isolate the peer.
-The peer doesn't check for double spends and thus don't give him a confidence score like mycelium.
-I'm spending an unconfirmed TX and again, the wallet is stupid.

This makes no sense whatsoever, just add a rule to allow the merchant or payment processor to add more fees or more bitcoins to the same receiving address, and prioritize that tx.
Why on earth do you want to allow people to change the receiving address?
If you did this, you would have 100% foolproof 0 conf that can be confirmed after 15 seconds if there is no double spend detected. It can be reverted only if people are sending the conflicting tx directly to roge miners that use your "patch".

Consensus is never 100% is like having democracy and having one candidate win with 100% of the votes it's impossible.
Look, as Nszabo said: we need more engineering. 
To scale bitcoin and keep it trustless p2p is a programming challenge basically.
For now on the only thing we can do is up the blocksize and let the developers work out beter trustless lightweight clients.

@_date: 2015-06-21 21:50:11
actually you can get a 1000mb per second server right now for 150$ and that should be enough  for a 8gb blocksize. So it's not like current bandwidth will have to increase a lot.

yeah, but wouldn't it be nice to develop a second layer where people somehow can only listen to tx they care about ? like for lite clients. like some clients will be nodes and some supernodes. (like kazaa or mycelim supernodes)

I think it's absolutely unnaceptable that such a huge mistake happened, specially, if it's just some lines of code to get random sources from frequently updated pages all over the net and is not much to ask to get the user to provide some input in the form of drawing a cat and a few seconds of microphone singing a song.
TL,DR: we cannot longer trust a simple RNG, the user must be given a choice to add to the randomness, if he fails to do that, okay blame the user .
And i'm talking about all wallets!, i really doubt the built in random generator code from bitcoin-qt was enought for a person that boots from a live OS. The same goes for android random function on a recently formatted OS/smartphone.

your motives has nothing to do with the double spends and all with the blocksize. you just don't want BTC to be used at a point of sale. Just admit it already.

yeah, it will be as easy as to add a txt file on the bitcoin appfolder and make the bitcoin miner update it every few weeks, maybe automatically with a program. Then this miners post it on the blockchain to make a"vote", just like blocksize limit should be.
But bitcoin devs refuse to this...
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:16:48
no no, this doesn't require any fork, it's just something wallets have to do after you install them, to be sure they are using enough randomness to create new addresses. In some cases, like in the blockchain.info app the code was really bad.
Wallets suspected to be weak will have to move their funds to new addresses.

cannot upvote you enought!,
 it's up to miners to create the fee market and influence the blocksize, they can delay indefinitely low cost tx and influence the blocksize limit by accepting only tx with some fee.
What the miners don't want is downtime every few months to update the software.
 It may be just a matter of setting up a oracle that relays the bitcoin prize and setup the fees to a penny per kb or something, most of them would use the default fee thought.
The more usefull btc, the higher the price and if the blocksize became a problem they will be the first to start investigating into IBLT or other deterministic ways to solve the problem.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:24:55

first of all, get an antivirus. Not everyone will accept bitcoin, use cases are internet payments and international transfers. 
Second, you buy bitcoin at exchanges, look for one in your country. Then save in your wallet.
Last, you pay with your bitcoin wallet, i recommend mycelium app for android. The receiver also needs the app and can request a payment.

it was always like that, it's just that it doesn't get that much publicity, even people of this countries are used to that. for example in Vietnam you can only send money in, never out, there are fees and limits on the use of cards abroad but the regular people don't know because it's very difficult for them to apply for travel to any western country, and their cards never worked abroad because they cheap ones are not visa or mastercard to begin with.

ultimately a fiat currency is backed by the value of the metal that it's on the coins. It has happened again and again when the currency is debased, people start hoarding coins because their metal it's more valuable than the currency. It sure happened when they were made of silver.

It's a annual tax, keep in mind they already tax the interest the banks give you, to the tune of 20%, so it's possible the banks will "eat" this cost , and just offer less interests on the accounts.
On unrelated news: Spain limits credit card fees to 0.3% and debit card fees to 0.2%.  [7 cents max for transaction.]( Bank transfers, card issuance and maintenance are free in the Spanish online banks ING, Openbank, and bbva.

well there's a tab that says "manage names", where you can get an unique name and assign a text to it. obviously the client is data agnostic, so there's not any help into what kind of formatting a contract should have, (json string) that's for future apps to build a namespace for contracts, or even marriages... and their specs... The guys at monegraph for example have devised a way to store the hash of a image as to prove you are the author. etc.

The problem with namecoin is that it's not user friendly and the non-tech user don't know how to properly configure it to run with a webserver on their own computer, it's frowned upon, because looks insecure and who want to host content themselves.
Now if some developers decide to add drop-in support for nmc, hey maybe even making the blockchain distributed so the web-torrent user's don't have to download the whole blockchain, it will be awesome development.

no that's the  present and future network cost of securing the network and distributing the coins. and will halve every 4 years. is not like the FED create 80billion $ monthly, right? inflation is a hidden tax that goverments use to pay their debt, lowering the purchase power of your usd. bitcoin will be deflationary, so it really doesn't mater in fact it works as a stimulus package for the bitcoin economy. miners can choose to cash out or reinvest in the bitcoin economy, it works as an incentive as satoshi predicted.

[namecoin.info]( page is from current developers, dot-bit.org page was created by khal per request of vinced.
Vinced, the guy who coded the few changes in NMC, posted from april18 to june30 2011, and Satoshi last contacts are from [april 2011]( Vinced still continued in contact on the [namecoin forum]( (now migrated to .info) until end of 2011.
Plus most of the reward he received for starting NMC is still unspend per blockchain and he used PGP.
Satoshi commented on the bitdns thread but never on the namecoin thread. Remember that NMC use case is heavily related with wikileaks and satoshi stated he didn't want this kind of attention on bitcoin.
So the statement on the namecoin page is wrong. Namecoin founder appeared around the same time Satoshi vanished, just to dissapear as well in August 2011.

if you have to put username/password on your phone (blockchain.info app) it's on that website, if you don't (mycelium app)the wallet is on the phone but it queries a website to check your balance. (so it doesn't have to download the Blockchain.)
Everyone's balance is on the "net" but you need your wallet's keys to access it: with the original program you are hosting the Blockchain for yourself and checking the transactions by yourself. It is not expected nor necessary that everyone does this. (blockchain.info, merchants, exchanges etc do it for you.)

because a high price would attract more sellers, thus obscuring the fact that they were running a fractional reserver, but then some miners deposited new minted coins, and try to withdraw them, as this is impossible, because they need 200confirmations, it will fail, so they will keep trying to withdraw , thus generating a lot of tx ripe to abuse under the the tx maleability bug.

if you want to get familiar with bitcoin code and develop it in new ways try namecoin for starters, it's built on old bitcoin code that have taken different direction, it is not another altcoin, it needs developers to help update it to current bitcoin code and improve it. it will also allow you to create new things. Some bitcoin commits have come from nmc improvements. Did you know it's possible to exchange a domain name for a sum of namecoins in an atomic transaction? this was used as the base for the scrow now it's beeing proposed for btc.

as long as someone else has access to both networks, like with a satellite connection, he will relay blocks between both networks and prevent a double spend. 
People use VPN on china all the time to bypass ip blacklists, that's not necessary in bitcoin.
So, even if they cut the whole internet you just need to get mobile internet coverage from a neighboring internet country to get the latest blockchain update to the whole country.

there are no sidechains yet, a sidechain will be different from namecoin in that it does not generate new coins and it would use the same coins as bitcoin, just in a different chain, but that this will take off is still debatable, since you need miners to perform this function. 
I suggested you before to use namecoin because it has it own method to allow you to setup a meaninfull name and some data for each of your records in a easy-er way just by downloading namecoin-qt and anyone can look it up on namecha.in or any block explorer. 
The price for setup a name is currently 0.02 nmc so you can buy it on a demand basis. There's also the possibility to use the same method than factom is using on top of namecoin, you just need to check what is cheaper. the difference on the addresses is just that they start with N/M but they are generated the same way. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:51:40
well, yes, with namecoin each name is it's own Certificate Authority, you would have to steal the private keys and thus the domain to be able to fake the certificate at which point it will be pointless since all changes are recorded.
This proposal is actually just another way to lookup the revocation of certificates of regular domains, a proof of concept if you want, it can be done on any blockchain.

Look, end users don't have any need of run a full node.
Just like to use visa you don't need to run a visa server. The most usual reason newbies give up is that they go and download bitcoin core and when they see how long it takes to sync they give up thinking "this can't possibly work". 
We need bitcoin lite version with SPV soon.

yes, yes this will be optional, you should be able to choose the operating mode: download all blocks, or just blocks from the last checkpoint or headers etc. IS that difficult to just make the miners put a hash of the UTXO as it was x blocks before in every block? ad make that file downloadable instead of the blocks...

first of all, before giving back any btc, should be an audit and the accounts of the hackers and other fraudsters blocked. People that got their money in thought Liberty reserve should also be frozen, as that money is no longer available,( and it's one of the reasons the FEDS are behind Karpeles ass) 
Also first have to be returned the money and btc of the people that didn't do any trading. For example, i sended money the 20 and don't even show up, and i deposited btc when the withdrawalls were frozen and didn't trade so. This users should be given priority. then i would recoment use the same model as VIRCUREX, vircurex froze a proportional part of the lost coins in hacks by distributing it to costumers and create a new frozen funds balance. 
Then the people should be able to trade this frozen balance for Gox equity or choose to wait until is repaid by fees. 
anyhow the best solution is that they are acquired by someone that knows how to run an exchange...

It's at best a proof of concept for geeks for the moment, i would keep using lastpass unless someone really do some breakthrou in identity management, i'm talking about some kind of 2FA for this, without the need to expose the private key *or password* at any moment, if is exposed it will be very insecure.

Bullshit, that won't be a "hostile hardfork", more like a mainstream internet users hardforking you and other blocksize deniers! 
Right now Gavin and others making patches are saying, please choose one and commit this into core.
Are you going to wait until 51% of the miners actually starts using this versions to upgrade core ? Are you willing to wait until everyone gives you a big F-U vote ?
Why not come with a real long term solution, like making the blocksize limit dynamic with a target of a x% blocksize fullness and x btc of fees per block?
Look, i understand that you worry about decentralization, but shouldn't you let the free market decide? Let miners choose? let users choose?
I don't think there is risk of banks or companies centralizing bitcoin, the only risk is that regular people can't run bitcoin, and that is already happening and will get only worse unless a light client is offered alongside bitcoin-core.

No you cannot attach files, but a hash is a representation of a file, just like a url, various programas are able to download a file just with that, like utorrent:  usually with format  [magnet:asdfgh]( for example. So you could use the bittorrent client to share the file, and get for you a magnet link, then share this link by mail or posting on the bitcoin blockchain, you can also do it on the namecoin blockchain in a more easy way since it allows up to 512 characters of text right from the program interface. The cost will be the btc fees or 0.01nmc. Keep in mind there are other ways far simpler to share something, you may as well use twitter to post your hash... Unless you are Ed snowden using the blockchain is kind of overkill.

It's true. There is some law banning the export of weapon technology and it includes strong encryption and machines with computing power superior to x terahash/sec . to some countries.
If you work on "HAL" overseas you sign some non-disclosure forms about privacy and hidden there it's a disclaimer form about the use of technology and , it also says that they have a "permit to export decryption technology no higher than a x terahash. "

1- They get to send the new btc to themselves
2- Yes
3- No in our lifetime
4- You can send a transaction instantly, it's just not confirmed until it gets into a block, a block number of tx depends on inputs and outputs, you can put a few thousand in one Mb.
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:17:16
that's why namecoin was created...
all namecoin tx are stored in a block which hash is then stored on bitcoin coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:21:53
Just something like MaxblockSize= Min(((average last 2016block size)*2), 1Mb)
That way the MaxblokcSize will become just another parameter like difficulty. 
We will get headlines, like."Given the exponenial grow in TX volume in the last few days the average confirmation time is now 2 hours until the next retarget, a higher TX fee is recommended until then" 
But nobody will panic because they know the blocksize limit is dinamic, instead of causing a  fork-discussion every time it needs to be raised!
People that don't want to increase the limit only want to see a fork for a few hours to get cheap coins and double spend!

actually no, this is not bittorrent were the more seeds the better, the more nodes, the more bandwith the network uses, so a number between 100 and 1000 is optimal, only miners, exchanges and payment processors need running a full node. Maybe big wallet services too.

yes namecoin runs on top of bitcoin and does so without making any TX.  It doesn't use bitcoin for anything more than publishing winning block's hashes. It is not a federated network, because it uses POW to determine the winner of the next block, while this uses POS determined "minting" servers that you call "federated network".

look, i reported tthis problem to the bugbounty email years ago.  no response.
yesterday, for example, i will consistently see last price 2700  eur and my buy limit orders ar 2710 don't get filed.  ( i speculate that this is due to the "last" price ticker showing a "settle" position)
other bug is that when you have orders with leverage and you click on close the order ,and you add a conditional close ,then you close your leveraged order but the conditional close ends up with a leverage position that never closes because there's a mismatch on the leverage, you have to manually close it with leverage because if you just click on close order it will just do an order but will not close the leverage position.

Look users want bitcoin to be able to support a high TX rate, they can't care less about what some devs think since no-one is using bitcoin-core except miners and devs.
If bitcoin core wants to survive i guess it will have to find a way to accommodate more TX, it's time to look for solutions, not only allow a SPV trust-less mode by default, but real engineering. It's not sustainable that everyone has everyone's TX, why not made the client just query for the blocks that have their own TX. like in a DHT, and only require miners to maintain the whole blockchain,
 It's like asking all BitTorrent users to download all torrent files before allowing them to play the file they want!

this: Sidechains and lighting network, as it is, *are* altcoins. 
It is key to make bitcoin scalable, time to recognize that pools are inevitable is part of that. Blocks will be composed of sub-blocks that contain TX of certain characteristics, pools will have miners that mine this sub-blocks and add only their hashes to the blockchain. Users will be able to download only the headers and the required blocks to verify the TX or will have to directly connect to the TX destinatary (sender) to send him the TX and prove that is correct(and to allow the other party to relay the TX independently). TX will be relayed directly to miners/nodes that signal that they accept this TX. TX load will be this way balanced by using a distinctive characteristic of a TX, like it's hash... A DHT table will be used to determine which nodes stores what.
In the end blockchain data will increase but not everyone will need to store all and relay all TX. And it will be trustless.

I mostly agree. My take is that this is a conflict  between those who want 
1-decentralization and privacy.
2-mass adoption and other blockchain uses.
On group 1 we can found the bitcoin developers, anarchists, libertarians and other snowden-like characters that value privacy like darknet users and scammers.
On group 2 there's the regular user that uses a real name on their facebook profile, investors that don't need to use gmail behind 7 proxies, and companies that want to use the blockchain for other uses, like proof of existence, and need low fees and block-space.
The arguments on group 1 are concerns about not being able to run their full bitcoin node from their home laptop and that this will lead to centralization on coinbase-like services. This is demostrated by post on the bitcoin-dev list where they show concerns about things like "SPV leaks your public addresses when quering them" and "BitcoinXT new seed-dns requests may be used to track you by a 3 letter agency".
The arguments of group 2 are obvious, they want to increase the number of TX, to achieve mass adoption and bitcoin value in general. Increasing the blocksize it's the fastest way to address this, however they miss that this is a trivial change of a parameter that can be done at the push of a button.
Neither group has tell the whole truth, as it's clear now that increasing the blocksize it's not a definitive fix for all of the bitcoin problems, it's just a necessary step that will be taken once there's a clear road-map for scalability of the blockchain.
Proposals like ultimate blockchain compression, blockstore, the use of DHT, and possibly a complete rewrite of the way bitcoin operates and updates it's database (processes transactions) will be needed.

the idea is buy low, sell high. so that way you don't have to care about the fees of the exchanges. So if you want to save on those fees, just buy, and put your sell orders on a AU exchange once the price has risen.

there is no "cost" to mine for the final user.

you are missing the point, openbazaar could change at any time to use a SPV client or a blockexplorer to read the data. Heck they can even change to their own namespace if they want. Anyone can run another registrar just like onename using the same or another namespace.
The point of onename is that they had a standarized rules, and api and offered the names for free. I guess their bussiness plan will be to start charging for the registration once they run out of free names. (but even then you can register by yourself using the namecoin client and you will have to pay the fees to register a name on namecoin anyway)

When Daniel Masters walked into a bitcoin conference in Amsterdam last year, he had spent more than a decade riding the boom in commodities markets. Held at the city’s sleek Passenger Terminal venue, it was far from the typical gathering of oil traders he was used to attending.
The chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the controversial virtual currency, wore a shirt emblazoned with the word “geek”. Patrick Byrne, chief executive of Overstock, a retailer, who had spent years railing against Wall Street and short-sellers, gave the keynote speech dressed in a Chinese suit from Shanghai Tang and quoted Marx, Hegel and Kant.
The informality did not tip over into triviality, though. “I didn’t know what I was going to find. But the minute I walked in, I realised it was a very serious proposition,” says 51-year-old Mr Masters, who started trading oil in the 1980s at Shell, decades before bitcoin’s creation in 2009 and its subsequent adoption by the libertarian tech community.
“You got a sense of the body corpus of the bitcoin industry, and it’s solid. This had just the most spectacular energy around it, and that’s when I said ‘this is absolutely for real,’” he recalls.
The conference was a turning point for Mr Masters, giving him confidence in his instinct that this was a career change worth pursuing. A few months later, in July, authorities in Jersey approved the Global Advisors bitcoin fund he runs with his business partner.
The fund buys and sells bitcoin in a bid to take advantage of its price movements. Other funds set up in the US are yet to receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Having suffered bouts of hair-raising volatility, frauds, and the high-profile collapse of an online marketplace that sold illegal drugs for bitcoin, the sector is now attracting a more mainstream crowd.
While early enthusiasts saw the virtual currency as enabling anonymity, the collapse of borders and freedom from traditional banks and middlemen, many of the new entrants have worked for the world’s largest financial institutions. Larry Summers, former treasury secretary, and John Reed, former Citibank chief executive, have joined the advisory board of Silicon Valley bitcoin start-up Xapo, it announced in May.
Still, in the investment business, Mr Masters is somewhat of an outlier, betting on the future value appreciation for bitcoin. For regulators, there are still concerns. The SEC issued a warning last May to investors about the risks of fraudulent bitcoin and virtual currencies products.
Last year, HSBC cut its ties with Mr Masters’ companies after 15 years, when he approached them about acting as banker for the bitcoin fund, because of fears about the risk of money laundering, he says. Mr Masters says the fund went through a stringent approval process with the Jersey Financial Services Commission.
Why buy a bitcoin fund
Bitcoin attracts its fair share of supporters and detractors, who argue over fees paid to exchanges, the interest by banks in its technology, and the utility of using it for purchases. Jeffrey Robinson, an expert on organised crime, is the author of the book BitCon: the Naked Truth About Bitcoin. He says investors should be aware that the market is very shallow and controlled by a few players.
“Why would you buy into a bitcoin investment fund when, if you want to ‘invest’ — make that, gamble — on bitcoins, just buy them . . . My advice to anyone thinking about ‘investing’ in this kind of nonsense is, what you’re really doing is playing roulette. So take your money instead to Las Vegas where you know for sure the wheel isn’t loaded.”
Those pursuing similar projects to Mr Masters’ are few. In 2013, Barry Silbert launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which this year allowed investors to trade its shares on an over-the-counter marketplace. The fund is not registered with the SEC. And a bitcoin exchange-traded fund set up by the twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who achieved fame through their involvement with Facebook, is still waiting to be approved.
But interest in the sector is growing. Mr Master’s ex-wife Blythe Masters, a JPMorgan veteran who played a key role behind the development of credit- default swaps, this year became chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings, a virtual currency start-up that aims to settle digital and financial assets using the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin that records its digital transactions.
That technology is expanding bitcoin’s reach into the boardrooms on Wall Street as banks and exchanges assess how they might make use of it. But as a means of payment, it is still nowhere near to being widely used. The market capitalisation of all bitcoins hovers at about $4.16bn, a fraction of the global currency market. Consumers are more likely to use a Starbucks app on their phone to buy coffee and PayPal to send money to a friend than bitcoin.
For Mr Masters, it is an investment opportunity. It has all the characteristics of the oil market when he first started at Shell in London in 1985, he says, being volatile, periodically illiquid and sparsely regulated.
It was at Shell in 1986 where he first met Russell Newton, his business partner. In 1999, after Mr Masters had gone on to hone his skills as a trader at Phibro Energy, one of the biggest oil traders of the time, and run the energy business at JPMorgan in New York, the pair set up a commodities fund, Global Advisors.
His fund started buying oil at $15 and $16 a barrel for delivery years later, probably buying more than $1bn, he says. His best year was 2000, when the fund returned 40 per cent and had average assets of $180m.
The commodity fund was closed in 2013, as investors withdrew their money and commodity prices peaked due to China’s slowing growth. A year later, Mr Masters dived into bitcoin, where he advocates a similar buy and hold strategy overall.
Demand for bitcoins is likely to increase as it is used for small quick payments through social media such as Facebook for reading news or renting out your WiFi, he believes. It will coexist with digital platforms such as Apple Pay and PayPal, which transfer conventional currency, but it will be used more in cross-border exchange.
Bitcoin and its technology can better integrate with our digital lives than current payment settlement systems, which are already decades old, he says.
“It’s not about ‘we’re trying to screw the banks’, or hackers taking over finance — it’s nothing to do with that. This is a technology which offers opportunity and utility that simply doesn’t exist in the current system.”
But riding the volatility of bitcoin through Mr Masters’ fund will require investors to place a large amount of trust in him, rather than buying bitcoin directly. Trust is a problem that has bedevilled the digital currency’s development, especially since an ever- expanding number of companies have sprung up to offer services for buying, holding, and selling bitcoin, at a fee.
Similar to oil in the late 1990s, when investing directly was rare, he wants to bring more investors into bitcoin. His fund has attracted 10 investors including wealthy individuals, family offices, and two global money management firms. The invested amount ranges from the $100,000 minimum to $600,000 per investor, he says. It is up more than 20 per cent this month because of the turmoil over Greece.
Unlike many who attend bitcoin conferences, Mr Masters believes the digital currency can flourish only in partnership with legacy financial institutions, such as the large banks.
There has been a clear change since he started the fund among banks and governments, he says. “The lesson of the last year or two is the more transparent, the more embracing of regulation, and the less libertarian and confrontational you are, the better your bitcoin business does.”

Then In the elections that re-elected maduro the oposition was not present because they were not allowed to join. It wasn't a legitimate election also because of the electoral powers was controled by Maduro. 
They also tried to neutralize the assembl from the beginning by ruling them out of quorum from Maduro apointed TSJ members. members appointed by the last assembly after they  lost the election!

Mostly not yet until there's specific software for this. you can offer a bounty to create software but i wouldn't recommend to do it on top of bitcoin *directly*, but indirectly. This is because bitcoin is for storing financial data, for other data you should use namecoin. 
For example, you could create an identity,  link it to your media profile and then sign with it the scans of documents and put the hash of the scan of said documents to a new name. all this for 4cents.
The beauty of this is that you can copy the software from proofofexistence.com and start your own notary service over btc or nmc. And charge anything you want. Regards.

if you don't pay enought fees your transation can take a long time. You can only send free transactions if it's been a day since you received your coins. that's to prevent spam.
@_date: 2015-04-03 15:07:59
in theory you only need to look for bitcoin blocks, you don't need to actually find blocks that meet bitcoin difficulty, just blocks that meet your coins difficulty. however if what you want is secure your coin you will need to ask pools about merge-mining your coin,  the more pools that do it the more secure it will be, since if anyone with a 50% hashing power on your coin would be able to control it.
Even now the number of miners on nmc is under 40% of what bitcoin is, mainly because they see it as a hassle to have to maintain this new blockchain or a competitor to btc. Namecoin was crash prone at the beginning, hopefully this will be solved when the updatednamecoin core client is released.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:25:52
no, you save on fees, they will likely deposit into your kraken account, and it's up to you to buy bitcoins or withdraw.
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:44:47
how about getting the data *from the blockchain*, miners vote every block and it uses the average price of the last 2 weeks... from this, all nodes know the minimum acceptable fees, and, pay a little more just in case they need to get ahead of spammers.
in fact all miners should post their target maximum blocksize and their target minimum fees and the network should be able to reach consensus every 2 weeks and determine the values that should be put in effect for the next period, just like difficulty?.

 Stop being so, "OMG, i'm my bitcoin node is quering an ip to get seeds/price, it must be a trap from a 3 letter agency!" 
You are already depending on github, google, your isp, your AV, skype, dropbox, the microsoft servers, the play store... your tinfoil-hat argument can apply to everything, if you want privacy get a VPN. Get over it, btc is not anonymous and it won't be anonymous.

wrong, a minimum fee of 0.5 cents for generated output will allow any amount of users to join, while a fixed block size does not allow an arbitrary number of users.

After reading you again, i think it's too complex, I would rather have a system in which each user must store the proof of validity of their inputs.
Example: i send to your phone some bits and i also open a connection directly to send you the proof of my inputs (the merkle tree thing) now, you have the needed proof to send those inputs to another.
But what if your phone is offline or you don't want to have a direct connection with me because anonimity... then you will have to ask the network for proof and nodes with that transaction will give it to you.
Some will say Oh, it's still not anonymous, now people know my transactions, but this can be fixed by making everyone store part of all the transactions proof, just like utorrent or freenet makes you store part of the total content.
What do you think of this and my [previous]( proposal.

No, i would say keep one main blockchain without any tx only states of the UTXO and ammends to this UTXO and hashes of a n-number of aditional chains. All miners will try to mine this and randomly one of the aditional chains (with merge mining). Now, the users only need the main chain data with the hash of all the UTXO or the hash of the subset of UTXO that contains his/her transaction.
And miners can use the aditional chains actual proof of the transactions to accept of reject blocks building as usual if both chains follows the rules. 
At first this seems that would led to longer reorganizations and the need for more confirmations to prevent double-spending but it shouldn't be that bad if most miners are legit and you only need that one node checking for bad data to release "fraud proofs" like says.

Zooko's triangle was solved by Namecoin. the elephant in the room when talking about colored coins. Because i don't expect stocks to be running directly on the bitcoin main-net and Namecoin is the first app running on top of bitcoin. Is worth money unlike sidechains and it's not even being mined by all bitcoin miners, so how can you expect a propietary colored coin design to be running on top of bitcoin without pushing it to all the people that don't need them.

Step 2: Central bank of your country takes control of the bank.
Step 3: Bank run
Step 4: Withdrawalls limits and so on.
Step 5: All money over 100,000E will be pending bank liquidation.

next time you know market maker bots get disconected and you don't even know if your order has gone thru or not so, so people start market selling. you press the sell sell but cannot execute. it's OVER. by the time your order hit the market price is down 10% and the  starts to hover just above your selling price.

IMHO namecoin already does this as it stores on the bitcoin blocks the hash of the nmc block! (on the nonce or coinbase). the right course of action will be to try to convince to add this blockstore on top of namecoin nonce, As a proof of concept it could store a namecoins merkle tree there as well as hash of unespent txo and database of names. then add instructions that names using store/name can have values of any lenght but in fact will only contain a hash of the value and store the value on your DHT. and boom you laid the foundations for a lot of new apps. you can build trustless lite clients, store info etc.  I will be all for this and another changes like alowing some namespaces like file\ or store\ to NOT expire. Declare different rules for different namespaces etc. there's a lot of work to do with nmc.
TL,DR: Basically you should market your system as a solution to blockchain bloat, starting to solve the problem of blockchain size. then in bitcoin it stores money and in namecoin it stores data inside names.

No. bitcoin is like paypal but with it's own currency unit, divisible in a million bits. Its cash for the internet. Unlike the others everyone knows how many are in circulation and released each day.
Thanks to cryptograpy (the same technology that checks a file integrity) no single person controls it. It gets it's value like a stock, because each bit represents a share on the whole bitcoin economy. (think investing in paypay if they only transacted in paypal shares!)
 You can open a wallet to make transactions with an  app, or an account with an exchange, both are like bank accounts.

highly unlikely, because they are already on the SDR so they don't really have any problem with their currency becoming worthless. Second, any big enough nation will have problem with peggin their currency to bitcoin, AKA deflation. It could work if some small nation hoard btc in hopes of paying their debt later. AKA puerto rico if they had bought btc a few years ago. for example. Venezuela tried to do that with gold but it backfired,  since every country owns gold.

Xapo, block.io, greenaddress uses multisignature, that means, the user cannot doublespend. Most likely bitpay knows this and will offer instant confirmation for people using them, if not, for high value items Bitpay makes you wait until the tx is propagated to most of the nodes, 30 seconds. For very high values, more than 10 btc i'm sure they make you wait 10 minutes.

many times altcoins had higher volume of trading than bitcoin. But if they can't even find the Cryptsy guy who run with hundred of millions in altcoins, (or was hacked as he claims). OR the iGOT or crypto-trade or... 
I doubt they are getting the Gox coins back unless A: they are in a exchange and B: the exchange cooperates with L.E. The robbers could may as well keep most of the coins in his cold wallet and bought coin offerings (i remember some with more than 1000btc in funding) He could be mayor stakeholder in many altcoins or do you really think people are so stupid as to buy those.

to make any coin merge-mineable you will have to hard fork it. 
your question is : can i mine both chains simultaneusly the same way that you can mine BTC and namecoin? and the answer is NO unless HUGE changes in mining philosophy take place. 
However Namecoin can be mined with BOTH bitcoin chains, as is.

pretty sure they will turn on miners once difficulty is down, to get more coins, sell them, crash the price, and turn it off once diff goes up again. buy cheaper, sell once the blocks start going slower and price goes higher..., rinse repeat.

Best way to support Namecoin: ask your pool to support merged-mining and contribute with code and or donations. 
Namecoin hashrate now up to 60% of Bitcoin: (there is no downside to merge-mining NMC with bitcoin)
Namecoin DNS bundle released: resolve .bit domains seamlessly.
Namecoin Core 0.13 released: in case you only want the wallet.

@_date: 2017-06-10 11:17:56
exactly, and also there is a bug in the fee system: miners can send tx with high fees to themselves to rise the average fee for everyone. Because most wallets calculate fees with the average fee to get you tx in the next x blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:56:39
yes, fees are based on what people are paying, so actually miners can game the system by sending tx with high fees paying to themselves. 
there is no feedback with the bitcoin price, it doesn't know the price. You may argue that people will not send tx if they are so expensive and that will spell the end of btc as a payment system and become only a vehicle for investment and speculation.

In case of a hard fork it's recommended to not accept new deposits as final until it get's resolved. This is important for exchange websites. Most hard forks are planned far in the future, so when they happen everyone already has the new version.

Then the price will rise again and your post be archived on bitcoin-obituaries. 
fyi: only reason for btc to stop is if miners stop mining.
Even then, you can continue trading on the exchanges ;)

Namecoin's and other merge mining coins only add a few bytes of data into the nonce. You can't drop support.
 Way better than mastercoin and other coins that actually add data in the form of bitcoin transactions.
