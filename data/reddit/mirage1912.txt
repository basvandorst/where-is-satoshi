It is impossible to ban it. Cash is one of the biggest advantages of fiat money.

Because cash lets you do exchanges in the middle of nowhere, without internet, without electricity, without any device whatsoever. Just exchange paper. This can not be replaced.

No, that has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies. 90% of the fiat money is not printed. It is digital. Failure of banknote printing companies doesn't mean the failure of fiat money.

A Turkish youtuber did it on camera. Petrol is cheaper than tap water in Venezuela.

You can get your gas tank full in the petrol station for a snickers bar. Why would you bother for paying with BTC?

Dumb ones will lose it though. They will forget that they had it. One day when bitcoin skyrockets they will remember that they had some but they won't be able to access it.

Price of a commodity is determined by supply and demand on the buyers and sellers agreed price. My made-up coin will not worth anything if I just make it for no reason.(i.e. no demand) However gold always have a demand and good luck making that.

On small amounts bitcoin is safer and more secure. (by small amounts I mean from thousands to millions) But there are problems with bitcoin. Firstly, its price is oscilating. Thus, its value as an investment tool is negotiable. Secondly, You can turn gold in to cash anytime and anywhere in the world in case of urgent need but bitcoin exchange markets can be a bitch about it. The price of bitcoin just is not stable enough to trust it with billions of dollars. US dollar is not directly tied to gold but people trust in it and that is why you can buy stuff with a piece of paper or a plasctic card.

No soul has ever told it is.

bitcoin is going to sink in the next 25 years. this would be wild.

If I can afford that much gold I can afford moving it. I would not plan to sell it all at once. There will allways be a customer for gold. Take electronics companies for instance.

Bitcoin is replaceable with another crypto currency but you cannot make gold out of thin air. Our civilization and technology depend on it.

I would honestly pick cold hard gold if I ever had the chance. Bitcoin is awesome but there is no need to rely on it entirely. (Computer engineer btw)

If we compare both, I can code one of them(there is no guarantee it will stick around for a hundread years) and the other one was created by collision of neutron stars and a limited commodity on planet earth. Gold is irreplaceable.(from a manufacturers stand point)

You have a point. Let's agree to disagree. I guess this is an argument ahead of its time and time will show us if we live long enough.

Yeah. They are criminals. Tax evasion...
