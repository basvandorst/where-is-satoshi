Not just that but if money is stolen from a bank but the FDIC and deposit insurance. It would be like if you had Bitconnect coin but you would keep your money despite the owners committing such blatant fraud. So much convenience exists just right there.

What about cash... No fees there and at least with a credit card if you use it you can get money back if stolen unlike Bitcoin.

Are you serious, how do they get your info though? I am a little confused by this since I haven't bought cryptocurrency yet and don't know the process.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:23:28
It proves that Bitcoin will always be regulated by the US government. Bitcoin has to follow US rules set up by the government and can not be independent of the government in the US.

When I say out of thin don't literally mean air but I count solving complex mat problems which amount to burning of energy as thin air. If I created a coin it is something I made up, created some blockchain rules which takes energy to create the coin. This is not true when you print money on paper, if I print some dollar bills legally in a mint office it would have been made from the already agreed uponed value minus the inflation if I made the total supply grow with its creation.

Well if you are like the other commenters the IRS got both of their information and if that happened to you there is no stopping the IRS since they could take assets if they wanted or take part of your paycheck.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:32:39


Measures like this just shows the governments strength on money when they are willing to collect data if you use Bitcoin. I wonder in the future if the IRS and the government will crack down or require a paper trail as a means to explain your holdings or face a fine.

So what if it is a global currency, if you live in the US and want to buy anything you can't substitute bitcoin for cash. If you want to buy a car or pay your rent you can't use bitcoin unless you transfer your bitcoins into dollars in the US. This limits usage as no one has a use for a currency you can't use as currency.
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:31:53
My bitcoins don't create value from the very start simply because I can convince people to want my coin in large numbers on a database based on proof of work that takes a lot of electricity to run.
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:17:56
How is it not created out of thin air? What real resources are used to create the artifacts of the rules... dollars or some other currency or gold? To own Bitcoin you must first trade something which you yourself call a real resource which is fiat currency or a rock. Without an outside resource, the coin is worthless especially if you couldn't trade it for other fiat currency or gold/rocks. If I decided to create a coin tomorrow based on rules I made up those Bitcoins would have been created from nothing as it cost me nothing to make. The dollar at least when it was created was backed by the government which owned physical assets and potentially owns all assets by its citizens one way or another through taxes, seizures laws, eminent domain and other laws. 
The dollar and other currencies are constrained though inflation and deflation which we have seen through history. It is corruptible but so is the confidence that a particular bitcoin is worth one or a thousand. The value of bitcoin is also always attained by how much it is worth in dollars or some other currency and it is not viable or convenient to use as currency despite years of existence. Theft of currency is also easy to fix which is not with Bitcoin. The dollar gets value from its convenience despite it being vulnerable.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:42:57
The problem is when a cryptocurrency is created, it is created out of thin air(confidence) backed by nothing. The dollar while printed on paper is created from the value of the government which includes many physical assets and not thin air. If someone steals your Bitcoin you are out of luck which makes it super inconvenient unlike using a bank.
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:00:52
When I say create I mean quite literally the initial idea to create a coin all the way up to the point before you mine a thing. I birth that coin from nothing but then for it to be created I must use more and more electricity. Then add even more for resource loss from something I created from nothing when that coin is traded...
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:57:20
Lol, the rich and drug cartels would use crypto too to avoid taxes and they would avoid the most still over regular people. Once cash is gone almost all purchases will be done through banks where bitcoin can't touch and also bitcoin could never be as convenient as a debit card or credit card.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:29:47
The government makes the rules and everyone in the government is generally against cryptocurrency... This shows how crypto can never be independent in the US since the government makes all financial rules and laws which you can't legally ignore.
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:49:16
You are talking theoretically though, if any of what you were saying in that comment were true it would exist already and be expanding because of how convenient it would be. Each day I find people earning Bitcoins straight from their employer or people buying their cheeseburgers with their Bitcoins...
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:26:09
It won't age badly because the government will never let another currency compete against it and the government sets the rules so Bitcoin will never succeed as a currency in the US.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:40:38
I know it isn't banned but it can't be used as a substitute for a bank for business really. A business still needs to report transactions that are taxed by the government and has to be paid with US dollars. It will never be convenient.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:44:48
Now, U.S. Democrat Congressman Brad Sherman has urged his colleagues to consider banning bitcoin and cryptocurrencies due to the threat they pose to U.S. international financial power, saying bitcoin needs to be "[nipped] in the bud."

How the government makes the rules and everyone in the government is generally against cryprocurrency. This shows how crypto can never be independent in the US since the government makes all financial rules and laws which you can't legally ignore.

The government makes the rules so Bitcoin will never be allowed to work as a currency in the US.

Companies and states can't override the Fed so it doesn't matter what they do. The Federal Reserve has a monopoly on the currency with the US dollar so it has 100% of the reason to stop it for its monopoly it already has.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:38:07
Gold isn't wonderful as money because it is already hoarded and there isn't enough of it for 10 billion-plus people. It would never work  and would be super convenient for purchases over the internet. This is why the dollar makes sense because of its convenience especially in situations of theft which make Bitcoin a really dumb currency as you never get your money back.

I don't worship the government, I worship nothing but continued humanity as weird as that may sound. I believe the government presently is in control of the US, where I live, is needed to protect against anarchy. The government is far from perfect but I believe it is the best system we currently have. The US dollar and control of how money can be legally spent plays a huge factor in preserving order. As much as people like to complain things for most humans have never been better and in a large part of that success is the formation of governmental bodies. There are a lot of flaws with the dollar but manipulation is good in a lot of ways. I think it is important for the US to always be the number one superpower and to do that it needs to be able to manipulate its money and not be held back by the rule of a Bitcoin or by people who can easily reproduce what happened to Bitconnect. The dollar could tottaly be mismanaged like Bitconnect but that doesn't change my mind since the remedy would be to fix the dollar and not replace it. I simply believe the government should continue to have a monopoly of money and how that money can be spent or used. To me Bitcoin = Anarchy despite how cleanly blockchain technology can work.

Ask the guy your self, hi is in the comment section
@_date: 2019-07-21 07:51:08
The most valuable thing in the world to me is the US government with the assets it controls and its military, Bitcoin's value doesn't come close to it the worth of the US government.
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:01:27
The best monetary policy is the one that serves the best at that given time. The changes to US monetary policy that have occurred over history has always been in response to the changes that were occurring in the real world. I think it is impossible to draw up the perfect policy that will always work with absolutely no changes ever. The way life was back in the 1790's compared to now no one policy without foresight would have worked perfectly because of how drastically different the technology, transportation and everything else including the internet(and all the consequences that come with it) has gotten. 


This part is super weird because the US has 100% say of legality of what can be used for monetary transactions and essentially everything else. There could always be a black market for Bitcoin though. WTF does the Superbowl have to do with monetary policy. What does people's desire to watch a good game equate out to the US government not banning Bitcoin figuratively speaking? Some people still watch bad Super Bowl matchups so you point makes 0% sense in any regard here. The government doesn't need to come out with a rival product either because the government can simply not allow any other rival to exist. I've already stated this as the US has a monopoly on money and there nothing that can stop that monopoly unless many laws were changed.
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:21:02
I say hypothetically in terms of ever actually replace the current system of today. It has its niche and could technically replace dollars if people honestly choose to stop accepting dollars. My point is it doesn't stand a chance of working out in the end since the government makes the rules and money right as it stands is convenient. The government in the future as shown by Facebook's Libra demonstrates that any real threat of creating a mass adopted currency through Bitcoins will make the government force that coin to operate like every other by law or outright banning of the currency. The only way blockchain technology wins is the day the Fed decides to make the US dollar a cyprtocurrency.
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:38:22
Money in the bank is backed by the US government, that is as secure as you can get especially compared to money that isn't protected in such a way.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:58:43
Money helps but if you look at history your countries military does the talking. Kind of like how the Dutch owned New Amsterdam but that didn't stop the British who couldn't stop the US. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:08:29
The Federal Reserve being the central banking system of the US honestly means its serves as a cog that makes up the machine that is the US government. I don't think you understand history or how the real world works, money is only as good as those who own it. As long as America remains number one financially the currency it uses will also be number one with that being the dollar. Maybe one day the dollar will use blockchain technology but it will still be the US dollar.
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:10:19
Which just shows your money isn't as safe with crypto than having money in the bank
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:45:31
The risk is much less when you have the largest superpower in the world who has easily the best military backing your money. You don't get that with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:55:21
I edited it but it didn't go anywhere near 3000%
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:06:10


The whole conversation on the thread you replied never mentions the price at one time going above 3000%. You are trying to walk that back by saying something different now. The comments were only about the price now compared to 3 years ago.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:49:20
Problem is people don't need bitcoin but people will always need a place to live. Almost no one uses bitcoin as a currency beyond collecting like stamps or beanie babies. Since most people don't trust a currency that fluctuates way more than the dollar everyday purchases are out of the question. The dollar may be made of paper but the US government enforces its worth forcing people to accept or give dollars. Bitcoin can't force the government to do anything and no one can ensure the value of your bitcoin which is backed by nothing. At least the dollar is backed by the whole US government.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:24:50
Missed the run? Bitcoin has lost almost half of its value in a year.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:00:11


He said the price now, reread.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:20:52
You replied to my reply which quoted the price of three years to the price it is now. So you can't read very well if you can't understand April 10 2016 the price was 426 and compared to today it is not even near 3000% higher. When I said it didn't go near 3000% that means the percentage it did go up from 4/10/2016 isn't close to the price of 4/10/2019.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:33:48
That math doesn't add up. 426 was the price exactly 3 years ago and when you multiple 426 by 3000% you get 12,780
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:26:21
Where did I use the exact words of time frame in my comments?
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:17:33
Lol people just trash talk Gizmodo instead of what China might do
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:24:00
Well about a year ago it was almost twice as much so $5000 isn't anything to brag about.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:44:49
You are the one who can't understand now price vs three years ago exact price. Must be hard to be you :)
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:25:28
It doesn't hold a threat though because people don't use bitcoin like dollars. The US also could just start using blockchain with the US dollar which kills any crypto in the country. What does crypto have outside of block chain tech and collective beanie baby value?
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:12:30
My reply was to the price of three years ago vs now for the millionth time which means it didn't go near 3000% today. How are you not understanding I am saying the price didn't go up anywhere near 3000% when compared today. 426 to 5,274.17 is not 3000%.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:28:17
Even if blockchain is adopted the US government could just incorporate that into the US dollar leaving other currencies essentially worthless outside of collectors. If you live in the US the government will force the US dollar to be the only currency widely used as it is now.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:41:34


I made that reply saying time frame after I already said that I was talking about one price in the past vs the price today. Three years is a time frame. So time frame came after what I said before which was that it isn't a 3000% increase when you compare 426 to 5k.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:21:19
Honestly, I think bitcoin will go out like the beanie baby craze. It was interesting when it began but bitcoin isn't being used for everyday transactions and instead is being used for trades of currency just like gold. Gold though is physical and actually has some worth being used for manufacturing so that is the only thing it has in common with gold. 
Also the amount of energy used for 100 million transactions of BitCoins used 30.1 TWh vs Visa having 111.2 billion transactions that used .19 TWh of electricity. I would sell everything I had if I put any money in it.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:36:08
Bitcoin transactions rely on mining for transactions so there is no escaping it.
