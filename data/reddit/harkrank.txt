A lot of these shell companies were created by Scandinavian government banks. The same banks who taxed Scandinavian nations a whopping 13% of GDP in the 1990s. That's the controversy I guess.

Have you looked at what it actually costs to open an offshore company or an offshore bank account?
Joe Sixpack doesn't have any use of those services, that's why he doesn't have them, not because they're too expensive.

Offshore tax havens are available to everyone. Political influence to a few handful. There is a myth that offshoring is extremely expensive. In reality it may cost a $1-2k per year. The only reason mainly rich people use them is because wage earners have no benefit from them.
Offshore companies are one of the last lifelines that are still open to everyone to escape this tyranny.

Yes, but it doesn't take millions of dollars to do it! So many people who are holding out until that lottery jackpot makes them millionaires so they can "finally afford" to travel, enjoy life, not be stuck in this misery. Delusion! Enjoying life, travel, and having free time is not that expensive. People are just to afraid to take control and do it.

Sorry, but suicide seems like the better option.

Honestly, Bitcoin.com wallet is a good app, there's nothing wrong with offering both BTC and BCH. Apple laughs at you.

Work is so much more enjoyable when you aren't doing it because you have no other option. Even a job most people would hate is fucking fun if you know you can quit any time you'd like.

Your business is a very special one and what you say relates to what I wrote earlier. Bitcoin is great for buying products that have complicated legislation limiting payment providers. But day-to-day purchases - which are most small transactions - work fine with the solutions we have today.

You are completely trapped in an imaginary world. I feel sorry for you.

Speculation is just the creaming on the cake, you can't say it's all speculation unless it's an asset that banks and governments eagerly lend money for.

There's already tons of options for small transactions that work great. Normal cash, VISA/MasterCard, ApplePay, etc. People don't need Bitcoin for that. You know, I know and everybody knows what people need Bitcoin for and that works great today, right in this moment.

It's funny that somebody wanting government control over money is writing in a Bitcoin forum. The reason for Bitcoin is exactly to remove government control over currency. If governments could "crack down" on Bitcoin as you wish, Bitcoin would cease to have any value at that moment.

Because he'd have a salary nominated in Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin goes down he is fucked, if Bitcoin goes up the employer is fucked. And that's why the employer would never accept it. If they sign a contract saying they'll pay him for example 0,5 BTC per month ($4400), then they will have to pay it even if BTC goes to $20 000 and OP will take home $10 000, and they can't do much about it. However if BTC goes down to $5000 OP can just quit instead of taking the lower salary.
OP, you're never going to be paid in something as volatile as Bitcoin. Your best bet is physical gold, which isn't that volatile anymore,

Maybe those licenses were owned by offshore companies owned by him or his associates?
