Depends on the bank, I deposited 35k using a ATM and it was available the next day.

Also make sure you wrap your head and balls in tinfoil.

I too like to hide my wealth in massively volatile funds.

The problem is not IO bound.
LMAX runs entirely in memory because the act of matching trades at a high rate lends itself nicely to in memory hash trees.
The IO portion of LMAX is buffered by journaling, and to bootstrap it you have to take a snapshot of the in memory process and reapply the journal between the snapshot and current state. Again, this is very little IO.
If you use a language that sucks at in memory computation and hashing, and has a shit garbage collector (Ie, Javascript/V8), you are going to have a bad time.

Lol. 
I'm going to come back to this comment after the crash.
EDIT: BTC down $100 within 4 hours of posting this. Hilarious.

I'm back. 8 hours have gone by and whatever money you had in BTC is now worth roughly 50% less.

Awesome, so I can give my money to a bunch of shady overseas companies or deal with insolvent ones. 
Bitcoin is the future!

Just buy mBTC, its all the same right?
Or, invest in DogeCoin.
