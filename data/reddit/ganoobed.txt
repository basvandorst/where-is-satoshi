BTC at 1million would mean a market cap of 21 trillion.

He's gonna eat his dick if it DOESN'T hit a million by June 2020. 
I'm pretty sure I want to see someone eat their dick more than I want to make money tbh

You really need to do some research on basic financial theory. The basics still apply to BTC, but the technology is such different.

I bought at 4900, and then added a little more at 5900, and then a little more and 15.5k tonight. 
I bought early October I believe, so I am way way up. I will still hold, mainly because the capital gains tax on holdings less than a year old is ridiculous. But I can totally see why people who bought in the last week are freaking out. 
Honestly the best thing to do is bag hold this shit to the end, it's not a question of if it'll bounce back, it's when it will. 
History tells us it won't be all that long. People keep telling me to buy into alt coins, but they're all down and there isn't a single one that I'd trust to recover the way I know BTC will.

I bought at 4900. The only reason I'm not freaking is because everything is down around 20% at least.

Ripple is centralized though, right?

No kidding, I'm really getting tired of some of the people in this sub that make declarative statements without backing it up or explaining why.
For instance, "It will never go under 10k again."
These are people that probably bought 2 days ago, and have no understanding of BTC or its history.

If it hits 100k in 2018, I'll gargle your balls out of pure excitement

To be totally honest, I'm not sure whether or not I want to be rich or see him eat his dick. 
At the end of the day, I'd be happy with either.

Thank you very much! I switched it all to Electrum.

Jesus fuck where do you live and how do I move there

No, of course not. It's not just "fine," it's quite possible, depending on the sector, that they've returned a halfway decent profit as of today. 
Especially if you look at the housing market, which has rebounded almost past what it was at in 2007 for a lot of places.
I'm not saying it's necessarily smart to hold/buy before/during a bubble. Just that over time, history has shown that it's almost always safer to hold your position (bag holding) until the rebound.

I'm not a doctor. 
There is no mass conspiracy, the banks are not stealing your crypto profits to pay off the losses they took when another one of their debtors failed to satisfy their debts.
I'll be honest, I only read the first few sentences of your post. It's a massive wall of text, and it started out a little crazy.

FBI? Did they tell you why, and if not, were you able to get at least a little bit of an idea about what was going on?
I sold a LOT on one of those

Probably can't retire comfortable with 25BTC unless they're worth 100k each or so.
I'm not planning on retiring until I have 2.5m in assets and cash, maybe another 20 years or so.

Remember the 2008 market bubble? Bubbles are fine when you're in for the long haul, as shown by the current US stock markets.

Thanks all, I switched it to Electrum!

Definitely bugging out, that's almost half of the market cap lol 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:38:33
I'd imagine it wouldn't go through. Your best bet is to not set a stop loss and just ride the waves. It's so volatile that a 2k drop in a day means very little as it could gain 4k the weak after. 
We've seen it happen, although on a smaller scale when BTC wasn't 5800.

I only have like 800 bucks worth of BTC left over, so it's just sitting in my Coinbase account. Will I still get both?
