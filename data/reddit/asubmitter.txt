China ignores BTC = invalidates BTC
You left out the variable that subverts your non-point.

Screw the regulators, I'm referring to the general public. Bitcoin needs at least a portion of the general public to adopt it. Use by .0001% of the populace won't cut it. I'm not taking sides. This is a practical matter. 
Know your market. Whether or not weed should have a stigma is not the topic at hand. It already has one.

I have nothing against weed. My personal belief is that it should be on par with alcohol, legal and regulated. That being said, there is a stigma attached to Mary Jane and it is in the best interest of the bitcoin community to distance itself from anything related to illegal drugs. Moral and philisophical viewpoints on the matter are irrelevant. Bitcoin is not in the position to supersede the law. In the finance/trade community the law comes first.  Crypto currency has the potential to undermine "the man". Bitcoin can be occupy wall street in a suit and tie with purpose. But note that popular opinion will make the call and as passionate as you may be about love, peace and trees. Bongo drums and bongs will not further the cause. Save it for the afterparty.

Those reward points you earn from credit cards aren't really free. That 1% back comes from the transaction fees which are accounted for and passed on to the consumer by the merchant. Nothing is free.

Classic loveline is a podcast.

The guy with the logical viewpoint?  I'm not on a soapbox preaching some ideological bs.

Where is the confusion here?  I didn't say don't buy drugs with bitcoin. I'm saying there are too many threads with the title, "look at my new bowl courtesy of bitcoin".
During the public adoption of bitcoin the powers that be will use any and all means to associate it with things considered shady, unlawful or substandard. Don't give them ammo.

They can lower their prices and lure more customers. They don't have to but they can.

Why is it stupid to use?  Online access to my account doesn't grant them access to the funds.
