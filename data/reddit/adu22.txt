I thought you weren’t supposed to exchange money at burning man
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:47:44
Do you think that banks would provide the irs with names of people that have purchased cryptos to be audited?  How would the irs know anything about your crypto transactions if it’s decentralized?
Honestly don’t understand how it works, can someone ELI5?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:40:58
Is there any legal recourse?
@_date: 2018-09-23 07:50:45
Just a little odd is all. Sort of out of place
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:09:58
They need to structure it so that all states have access. Otherwise I’ll hold off on excitement for now
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:33:24
Don’t get sad! Good time to buy more :)
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:09:50
Tbh exchanges need to delist it entirely
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:25:34
I agree. Probably a better use of community resources to encourage legal action, information, and awareness. Less circle jerk trash talk and more support for the misinformed.
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:33:30
Even at such a modest rate that’s insane returns
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:06:44
By doing that I would think that they’ve defaulted on the loan
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:41:33
I feel you but I think it’s more likely to go up based on the tech alone. Adoption is spreading slowly but surely, further cementing its role in society. If it’s causing stress in your life maybe you could consider putting it out of your mind for a few days or a week.  Hit the reset button and come back with fresh perspective.  Up or down, it isn’t going anywhere :)
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:24:24
As if they aren’t making enough money as it is. I’m sure that even if they removed them and lost those customers, they’d probably gain at least half as many new clients who support their decision.
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:35:50
Who knows and unless it’s a significant amount or it moons and their purported investment should have been worth millions after the fact; I doubt much besides bad PR will come of it.  For now I think that’s running its course.
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:23:59
I remember seeing posts last week about people considering a lawsuit or something


Not sure if anything could even come from it but I generally don’t like this kind of scam behavior. People like that need to be made an example.  BCH can definitely have a place just don’t try to pull this kind of shit.  No one benefits. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 05:06:15
That’s what I’m saying!
@_date: 2019-03-31 12:59:31
Sorry I was trying to fit both signs in one shot. There was also a B logo above the door
@_date: 2019-03-09 11:16:06
Probably will hold its value better than a lambo too
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:25:30
Based on their google reviews they might not accept btc as payment!  Will let you know if I find out more tomorrow
@_date: 2019-11-27 09:06:27
You forgot to mention Kim jong 180k btc
@_date: 2019-11-02 07:23:37
I mean you could have just lost your keys. That should be enough of a reason
@_date: 2018-10-27 10:25:22
I thought it was just for funding transactions. Maybe you get a better exchange rate with bnb over btc/eth?
@_date: 2018-10-30 01:26:35
Not yet ��
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:12:03
Immutable, borderless, censorship resistant, distributed, transparent
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:31:43
Might have had better luck with shitcoin cash
@_date: 2019-03-31 13:40:03
Yeah I was already pretty tipsy and almost back to the hotel. I’ll stop by tomorrow to check it out.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:39:10
Definitely this
@_date: 2018-10-13 09:43:04
I WANT NAMES!!
@_date: 2019-08-31 20:13:15
Same with Oahu although a lot of people are shifting to Tesla’s to flex
@_date: 2019-10-18 01:41:36
Tried to sign up and they won’t let me log in. No password recovery method. Total failure.
@_date: 2019-10-12 00:20:27
Number of shits I’ve taken up 3,100% since birth
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:16:56
Clearly a rare green boner
@_date: 2019-02-23 10:05:53
Buy back your bags and diversify the rest in other sectors. If you don’t have a 6 month emergency fund, set some aside for that. Do you contribute to your ira?  401k?  Don’t go all in
@_date: 2019-06-19 08:42:30
Am I confused or would the fee make this a security?  If so wouldn’t that completely kill the project?
@_date: 2019-04-12 23:26:00
Simple jack
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:49:21
When I first saw the big genesis block sign I got excited. Then I read their little paragraph on the wall and was even more so. The reviews seem to say that it’s a good spot. Just unfortunate that they don’t service with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:15:17
Awesome. Willing to buy one!
@_date: 2018-11-01 07:56:24
Bubble confirmed
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:49:11
Hawaii has a backwards stance on crypto right now
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:07:55
Where we’re going that won’t matter
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:47:58
Somebody drank a few too many cups of the koolaid. The tax status is pretty neat though. Hopefully some savvy investors can make an impact there. I’m doubtful it’ll be these guys
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:33:07
Unfortunately Hawaii residents can’t buy. Missing out big time
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:53:14
Definitely a scam. Don’t do it
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:25:36
It still is for Hawaii and a few others. State laws are fucking us out of access
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:44:00
Exchanges will deny you service because they are required to hold the equivalent value in fiat. You can buy btc at an atm or on localbitcoins for a premium but then you don’t have easy, secure, or convenient ways to exchange it to Alts or sell.
@_date: 2019-09-03 08:52:45
Pretty sure we’ll be talking in sats by then
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:21:07
Over soulless gingers? Gross
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:22:36
What about a way to completely abandon ship and tank the value to nothing. Everyone moving to something new they (the banks) can’t control or access. Bitcoins bitcoin lol
Also sorry for my ignorance. I’m neither invested in crypto nor have the background in finance. Just sick of seeing those wealthy bastards win every time
@_date: 2019-05-25 08:11:54
It’s a feature!
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:50:20
Whats this play dough money you speak of
@_date: 2019-05-25 05:17:47
This is good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:02:40
Unless you’re in one of the states with anti-crypto laws
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:17:52
I’ve had some trouble withdrawing. Hopefully support can sort it out but I’m holding off on praising them just yet
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:01:03
@_date: 2018-12-24 09:03:14
Second this. Pretty sure there are sanctions on Venezuela. If you are caught aiding an embargoed country like this you could face serious federal time. Guantanamo time.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:27:29
Honestly idk. Just fails every time. Waiting on them to get back to me on how to fix it.
