If you can write a poem about bitcoin and/or MtRed. I will give you 3BTC
@_date: 2012-01-22 23:50:44
Send me an Bitcoin address ;)
@_date: 2012-02-02 15:43:39
That is a good question and will follow up on it later.  But right now I can say, we are not patching BIP16 or BIP17 until there is a major consensus between core developers, which I believe neither side has.

Sorry guys, It slipped my mind that it was a year old. It has been renewed.
@_date: 2012-05-01 17:29:44
Yes, Zagaberoo is correct, the remaining BTC is put in a buffer for blocks that last longer than the difficulty.  Our luck has been up this month which ensures that we can continue to operate fee free. Server costs about $200 a month (new host should cut this in half), and many months I've had to pay that out of pocket.  When I started MtRed it was at the time Deepbit was ~46% of all hashing, and was/still is/always be a pool for the miners and the bitcoin community.
Speaking of which, MtRed will be 1 Year Old in a week. (May 7th)

Well then who's the 3rd party?
@_date: 2012-02-13 23:30:48
Maybe you should be on @_date: 2012-01-09 23:44:46
I dont think you know how JSONP works.  Yes it looks bad, but this is whats required to get data from a domain other than the one your on.
@_date: 2011-05-08 06:48:25
Yea, I figure it will be a day or two before our first mine of a fresh BTC.  The server is logging all work done, I just need to build a cron job to parse the logs  every X minutes and update the db and display something to the userpanel. Simple :) do it tomorrow.

waiting on blocks to confirm. a rewards page and info for blocks found and stuff will soon come. 
@_date: 2011-05-12 19:41:06
Thanks for this :)
@_date: 2011-05-05 17:16:48
DeepBit is what im modeling from, but i have a few other Ideas I wanna try.
Payout wise, completely like deepbit except a bonus for redditors. (I also herd people complaining about his 3% fee, I may lower this to 2% or even 1% depending on operating costs.
No account created needed, just set the rpc username as your wallet address.
Payout whenever.
@_date: 2011-05-09 03:14:33
I like BaCoin
@_date: 2011-08-25 18:57:01
Well, removing hoppers would mean even less stats than we currently provide on top of adding a delay of the live stats.  We offer PPS to anyone that wants to get solid payments without the variation from hoppers or luck.
@_date: 2011-05-12 23:08:45
We found a bitcoin earlier, Its in the new rewards log (which you cant see yet :) but on its way once it confirms.
@_date: 2011-05-08 16:08:55
No Fees for now, Hopefuly I can get a script to calc the total GHash/s of the pool today.  I've been reading up on all the different payment methods and ways to deter cheaters.
As of now the server is logging all work done, and until we get our first block Im just going to distribute it equally between the amount of work/shares each account has put in over the total shares of the pool.
@_date: 2011-05-08 07:05:05
Questions to miners?
1) Do you want to have individual 'worker' stats and logins, or just 1 login &amp; stats for all miners?
2) Emails for registration? Registration at all?  (I like emails in case I need to broadcast something important to everyone, ip change or something, but am up in the air on it)
3) Payouts proportion to block solved or work done? (I like the 2nd, work done method, considering we are small, someone might mine for 2 days and we wont solve something, and then they log off and we find a hash. This method from today will proportionality credit accounts when we parse logs)
4) Anything else I'm not thinking of?
 I do plan to get graphs stats and all the bells and whistles over the next week.  Stay tuned and thanks. 
@_date: 2011-05-12 19:40:43
If you dont mind me asking where are you geographically? I dont log IP/s but thinking I might need to put a server over in Europe somewhere.
@_date: 2011-05-12 03:28:10
we could but the luck factor is too much at play on my end to get anything accurate at less than 1gh
@_date: 2011-07-31 21:06:44
Can you add MtRed?
@_date: 2011-05-12 03:26:36
thanks / its there
@_date: 2011-05-06 01:46:34
A lot of my ideas and reasoning are too from this Pool and reading both deepbit and Eligius threads I can kinda see what I might have to deal with and trying to lay it all out this weekend.  And yea, my min will be under 1btc if not .01
@_date: 2011-05-12 03:28:24
what miner?
@_date: 2011-05-18 23:04:24
I'm aware of some issues with the javascript that is purposed to block multiple clicks and will be fixing this issue tonight or tomorrow. Sorry for your inconvenience and watch for an announcement.
@_date: 2011-11-18 21:49:42
Would I be strange in guessing these were dehydrated with a mining rig?
@_date: 2011-05-05 18:41:11
Yes I did :)
@_date: 2011-05-08 06:51:06
Yeh; it saves me so much time at work.
@_date: 2011-05-08 21:05:00
Better Stats on the Way 
@_date: 2011-05-05 17:06:40
 is a good hardware guide (I actually use it to evaluate costs of hardware in number crunching cases)
Your gonna wanna the fastest / most expensive ATI Radeon card you can get.  The 6xxx Series is good but price/gpu i would get 5850'.
cpu / mem of mining machine dont matter. all you care about is your GPU.
*edit: hey hits 5/5 i just finished some exams and a little drunk :)
@_date: 2011-05-11 17:55:59
API soon to come, Its on your profile page (Just **bolded** it) but every one participating has had higher than their min payouts.
But with the huge influx of users, we found 2 more blocks last night that are confirming.  Balances reflex the work and people should get payouts. I think their may be a few accounts under the min so It looks like I gotta build some more payout code.
thank, RR
@_date: 2011-05-06 01:51:50
Ok great, so i have a box running the pushpoold server.  It works on the local intranet, need to call an admin and get a few ports opened. Maybe i need an iptables expert. Either way expect a new post in a day or so with connection details. 
@_date: 2011-09-13 19:19:57
I'm not sure how I take this? What is his motives?  Is this a stunt for namecoin? should MtRed offer NMC mining?
@_date: 2011-05-11 17:52:54
You may also want to try connecting to the current ip **69.172.229.136**
Also what is your worker names / or user account and I will take a look at the logs.
@_date: 2011-09-13 21:35:23
Is he trying to split Namecoin again, why was Namecoin split for merged mining? The bitcoin chain wasn't modified
@_date: 2011-05-09 03:14:53
comeone on, BaCoin.... meh i feel what your saying too.
@_date: 2011-05-05 03:49:06
I've been mining on deepbit for the last few days, and its been good. But have watched how fast the numbers of users there has grown and figured a few other redditors might be GPU mining and might want to start a new pool.  I have a server setup and have been playing with a few of the open scripts; but may build my own.
I just want to start a general discussion on the topic.  Thanks RR
@_date: 2011-05-08 06:50:18
Yea, I'm emulating some of the things I've liked in the bigger pools to something reddit can get behind. Also with deepbit reaching almost half of the total hash weight I think its important that we start building more pools.
all of this + i got some other cool special *reddit* perks coming.

We are at just under 1.5 GH !!!
@_date: 2011-10-08 16:44:35
Because when you send a transaction in bitcoin (and forks) it does 2 transactions. 1 to the receiving person, the other is the change and goes back to you.
@_date: 2011-07-31 21:19:32
Much love from the MtRed team.
@_date: 2011-05-09 03:14:15
@_date: 2011-05-11 00:07:13
Thanks to all. We have been super luck. Being ~1GH/s for the first few days, and we found 3 Blocks already.
Making me work over time :). Once I get all the bugs ironed out I have some fun stuff planed.
@_date: 2011-05-08 16:06:39
Yea my thoughts exactly.
Also, I love your miner status app. I will be sure to let you know when I get stats, and then an api for you to poll.
