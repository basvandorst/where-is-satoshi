People have been prospecting and mining their own gold for years.

Simply the best and most informative portrayal of Bitcoin, it’s value, and true use that I have seen to date.

Completely separate assets.  Apples and oranges.  Plus everyone knows bitcoin isn’t waterproof ��

Safe isn’t the right word here.  Plenty have lost bitcoin. Careless in how you store your coins? Gone.  Fast fluctuations in value? Not exactly safe either.  We should not be so quick to say “oh too bad should have had crypto” anytime there is an issue with a foreign bank.  That would be like if bankers said “see should have trusted us!” Every time someone gets their wallet hacked or loses their crypto.
Ready... set...  DOWNVOTE an honest view!

This is why bitcoin can never replace gold*
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:48:09
No, they didn’t have the widespread access to tech nor the widespread knowledge of it.  
A gold standard could have helped to.
Socialism was the straw that broke the camel’s back here.

True,  however the major impact is the downtime.  
Do you not see that as a pitfall or weakness for BTC? 
Bitcoin will be rendered useless immediately during the event, and depending on the severity of the storm, an unforeseeable time after- until power and internet can be recovered.  
I hate to say it, but that’s 3 pretty big vulnerabilities for Bitcoin in the event of a solar storm.  (Power, internet, and your hardware on which you use it)
You mention fiat:  so let’s compare:
  Your physical paper bills and coins will still function as a medium of exchange,  even if a everything electronic were to fail. I’m betting people will still accept cash in the event that credit cards, ATM’s, and cash registers all are rendered useless 
Lastly,  this isn’t about which is better,  but simply making better known a pretty large potential problem that BTC will eventually have to overcome.
Solar flares are a “when not if” certainty, and depending on the severity of the event, will be a pretty severe technological setback for a period of time in humanity

Problem solved.

Kind of surprised nobody’s mentioned Goldmoney.  Gold’s portability and usability issue solved.   Goldmoney.com 
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:03:09
In such a scenario,  good old fashioned barter as well as gold / silver / paper fiat will have its place during the recovery.  
 Truly wild “reset” period it will be

Excellent post, and the first I’ve seen addressing this very real threat.  It always surprised me that the BTC community doesn’t address this more often. It’s like an overlooked hazard people assume “won’t happen to me”
One solid solar storm could fully take down BTC’s ability to function through its disruption of the global network it depends on. Sure you’re private keys will be safe, but without electricity and internet, you’re just HODL’ing a usb stick.
