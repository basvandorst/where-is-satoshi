but brother your still building equipment and technology that can and is being hacked, ppl are losing bit coins with no recourse, do you under stand where thats going?? On my website though, only an image is being moved around, the security is in the platform not the currency. CGR platform is closed loop, your only spending or transferring bit coins to other members on site ( obviously its phased in as you get your merchants to join ). Sure there's lots of ways to use money and make it safer, my website is for ppl that dont want their money being stolen at anytime, ppl that want to access their money 24/7 and answer to no one, never have their money seized by Gov., or have $ lost by some bank scheme or fraud, $ disappearing into government coffers with no accounting or control, ppl that want %10 of all their spending capital going directly towards infrastructure, economy, charity. (CR) I understand that ending homelessness, poverty, and hunger seem like 'evil scams' to you and your crowd but where im from thats a high priority, an answer thats never been here til now. Now that its here you wanna talk crazy lol, ok thats fine but do it after you prove out what im saying doesn't work or doesn't make sense. 2.3 million to debunk  :) good luck
