@_date: 2014-01-12 07:54:58
No never used it
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:40:32
Ok i checked and it says sent
@_date: 2014-03-19 07:52:31
Still nothing for me normally they are very quick. I dont mind paying the fee if i don't have to wait.
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:07:48
It really could i can never figure out how to use the site.
@_date: 2014-03-05 08:36:02
whats the point in having 2fa if i can take it off with an email?
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:23:05
Nice looks like a good idea
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:58:12
Yes that's the one i always forget the name i got 12 with doge-dice the other day  its very high risk. I will look at the other way.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:37:16
Yes i admit it does not look good but with nothing official from Gox most of the comments are a pure speculation as to what will happen.
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:07:26
No idea really i think you would need a unique qr code for each customer. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:32:10
When i asked at my bank when opening my business account she had no idea what i was talking about.
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:04:48
I wish i had more spare cash to buy more BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:54:36
Not yet
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:42:58
I know i will probably get down voted but trading in alts ive paid off more then 6k in credit card debt which i would have never been able to with out first buying BTC. At the moment i have 1.6BTC and no debt.
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:52:06
Ive used them a few times and its nearly instant transfers.
@_date: 2014-04-15 14:35:14
Nice thanks
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:55:33

@_date: 2014-03-02 15:52:10

@_date: 2014-02-17 13:44:54
Ok that's what im after thank you.
@_date: 2014-04-23 09:32:00
Ill admit to being Nakamoto if someone sends 50BTC
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:11:35
It amazes me the amount of infected computers that they got so little.
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:55:13
Ok that could explain it 
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:46:30
I like the Bitcoin shirts with the qr code
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:07:02
Definitely  
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:12:12
Thank fuck someone has posted this. Really who pays to read the news?
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:41:50
I still can not believe they lost that much nobody is that stupid come on
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:11:22
Low but i think people would get something back.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:48:20
Thanks im sure i can work around the O/I and keep it short still nice to see i can do it though.
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:55:34
+1078 doge
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:53:56
ive used them on namecheap once when i had no money on my card
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:14:27
They have not lost anything yet.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:00:36
Im fine with that but having to pay using my card is not right in my book.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:47:36

@_date: 2015-01-17 09:02:26
Why would you say that?
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:06:44
Nice thanks they are cheaper 
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:05:08
With who im using coin jar but they are getting slower.
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:11:55
i know that but i only get an affiliate cut i don't mine there
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:35:16
Am i the only one that read half of the first step. Way to complicated for me.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:54:48
I might not have any BTC right now but im with it all the way i trade alts at the moment but my true faith is in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:59:06
The only thing is when ive waited before to buy i missed out because the price jumps.
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:03:22
coinjar used to be nearly instant until they moved to the uk 
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:51:11
I don't get this i make a small amount of bitcoin with a referral code i put up a couple of months ago and make the minimum payment about once a month. I just checked now and its in to a negative balance how does that work?
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:49:09
Same with electrum 12 words nice idea 
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:58:24
Everyone waiting to buy and when the price jumps up everyone thinking fuck i should have bought sooner.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:06:56
Very cool site have you had any problems shipping them to Australia
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:59:27
Must be
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:01:43
Always the same with me im too slow but does not help that it takes so long to get money to an exchange to buy some
@_date: 2015-01-20 12:00:37
No chargebacks
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:09:41
So how do i buy and sell safely
@_date: 2015-01-18 09:21:52
Have the Bitcoins been moved?
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:40:31
Nice i really like it.
How secure are the letters/numbers would they separate from vibration?
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:00:19
Im trying to buy as many as i can but it takes me at least 3-4 days to get money to an exchange 
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:05:54
A safe way to buy and sell bitcoins i wish my bank or paypal had that option.
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:08:07
Do you read GFY.COM people that have added bitcoin see very little sales.
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:27:14
I'm more in to cams but i like your idea i tried promoting chaturbate with a few Bitcoin related domain but it looks like they removed the option.
