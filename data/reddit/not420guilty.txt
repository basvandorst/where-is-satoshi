Ah.  So maybe the answer is:   "Whoever controls github merge requests controls the bitcoin brand".

Oh.  Newegg did disable bitcoin payments.  Bummer.

I'm calling BS here.   I think u made up the alt coin price details.   For example, Monero is not down ~30% over the past 3 months as claimed.
I don't really understand the motivation for this type of post.   Is the poster trying to motivate people out of alt and into btc....thinking it will increase the price or something?    Or it it just a fun story writing exercise?
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:28:31
Or at least cheap to use
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:51:34
I don't think it will hodl much value if it's not usable.

Our community has its share of profit motivated scummbahs also.

At ~7$ per transaction that's about 3.5% which seems high to me.

I am genuinely sad that bitcoin is so expensive to use.   I am a huge fan and want to USE it.  And I still can for large purchases or transfers, but btc is not currently reliable unless I offer a high transaction fee.
This has nothing to do with talking points, it is my personal and recent experience.   Twice recently I had purchased fail because I didn't pay enough ant it took too long and the receiver gave up after some time.   Luckily my payments were returned both times minus more transaction fees.
1% fee isn't great but it's not a deal breaker, if that worked reliably I'd stop complaining.

A quality p2p implementation does not require all nodes to have inbound ports be open. 
If bitcoin p2p implementation does have this requirement please link to a reference.

bitcoin core will not run in kubernetes with standard network overlay due to SNAT/Masquerade and core software node banning logic.  All connections appear to originate from the gateway address and very bad things happen when bitcoin core decides to ban the gateway address:

Please say it slower so I can understand.   U r saying pruning can't work?
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:49:24
What's your point?   Are you offering any new or interesting ideas here, or just repeating the same garbage?
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:46:36
So then it's ok.  No sign of a problem here.

There are many talented devs in the world.

What other than proof of work meeting consensus rules would you want to use to determine the "real" bitcoin? 
It seems most likely that one chain will be clearly dominant after the split, but "if it's not" is an interesting question.   When it comes down to it:  the miners (by satoshi definition) and the exchanges have most control over the btc brand.  The core devs have power by control of the github account but it's not hard to imagine a core2 fork managed by another group.
I have my private keys and my popcorn ready, this is going to be fun !!
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:27:41
Lol.  The devs are scared.  And they should be.  (F u sensorship btch)
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:24:03
Lol.  Core can't reach consensus with the community
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:46:58
Wow, that's disappointing.  Needs enhancements into this century

Satoshi is saying we don't all need to store all data for the entire block chain.  He shows that you can prune old blocks from the merkel tree and (regardless of block size) only need 1.2GB per year.

I didnt forget the users....I dont think they play a significant part in this.  Not since the users are different people than the miners.  The original idea was that they would be the same people, and in that case users would matter.
There are several types of users:
1) fanatics - those of us on reddit, make up an insignificant portion of the user base.
2) holders - they dont care much because they will have both coins so as long as they dont lose combined value they are fine.
3) speculators - they follow the money.
4) the payment companies (and end retailers who accept citcoin) - they will support both if the market will provide profit for doing so.
Nowhere in there is "the user running a node", because doing so will not have any impact on what name we attach to each chain.

I run core myself ATM.  No matter what side u are on u have to admit our core devs are part of the shitstorm.   Compromise is how people get along, not by name calling and personal accusations.
I guess I just find irony funny.  It's ironic that the cores code for consensus but can't/don't care to achieve it in real life.

The Btc chart looks nothing like the bubble charts.  Btc is not a bubble, it's a REVOLUTION!
