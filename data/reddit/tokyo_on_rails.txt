I sold 100 btc at $210 which would be worth over a million now.  :/  Sorry to hear man.  But if it hadn't been bitcoin it probably would have been something else.

I get like 10 connection requests a day from people with titles like "Investor at Blockchain". Too real.

The bearwhale, that was a fun night.

USAA still has funds they stole from me 8 years ago after they flagged my newly opened account for suspicious activity due to a deposit from my account in Israel where I was living at the time. All of my calls with customer service resulted in some of the most rude and disrespectful service I've ever encountered to the point where they were basically accusing me of fraud and repeatedly hanging up on me and refusing to return MY money. It wasn't worth pursuing legally for me, but fuck them.

They already have my ID, I spoke with them already.  They're banning everything unless I give them an apartment lease agreement.  Today is the day they gave me as a deadline.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:07:58
I deal with a dozen other companies that also follow KYC, I never experienced this before.  They have two of my IDs and verified bank accounts and credit cards.  Not enough.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:36:54
Well, for one, because it's impossible.  How can I give them my physical lease agreement within 7 days if I'm not there?  I don't travel with my lease lol.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:37:47
I would think that institutions such as Paypal would have the same requirements as Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:49:16
I just edited to add what they said.  They specifically said that was the reason.  Not another account, another country.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:53:15
The ridiculous part is that even if I gave them a lease agreement and everything later, my payment methods and bank accounts are still permanently banned.  They give me a time limit knowing I'm abroad to give them paper documents that I obviously don't take out of the country.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:01:34
I exchanged 9 emails with them and I brought up this point, and they didn't refute it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:47:37
They say they will remove my payment options and permanently ban them from ever being used again in the future.  That is effectively banning me, can't buy/sell/trade.

Yea, I was thinking of trying Gemini.
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:17:53
They've been everywhere for like 2 years

I use TD bank and they haven't closed mine. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:57:16
I bought 51 coins at the drop to $175, then sold at $220 like an idiot (though I needed the money for something).  They would now be worth 91k.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:24:45
I'd wage a holy war lol.  I live abroad and all my money is in TD bank, if they closed it I imagine it would be quite difficult to get my money back without being in the US.  But it should be fine.  I don't see any problems with TD bank and Coinbase, and Coinbase even has TD bank as an option to automatically link your account without microdeposits now, with just login info.

Reconfirmed the fact that you don't know what you're doing, you mean.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:16:58
Transactions are definitely taking too long to get confirmed nowadays. It's becoming less and less worth it to use each day.  Need to fix this soon.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:20:36
Yea but it's usually not as simple as them just agreeing to wire it somewhere.  I had a similar issue living abroad before and the bank from that time STILL has my money today, because they wanted me to file a bunch of paperwork and proof of address (in the US) and stuff.  I didn't have much in that account so I chose not to waste my time.  I'm not sure on Chase/TD policies about how to return funds after closing an account, but it's usually not a simple walk in the park if you don't live there and can't walk into a branch.

I've never had an issue in my years of spending with Bitcoin.  I'd either blame your wallet or you.  ;)
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:09:04
You have not yet lived.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:28:07
You do, if the value increased when you move it.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:28:55
It's annoying. Both of the coins I mostly transact in are not supported.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:27:40
As expected.
@_date: 2018-12-27 10:32:59
Who does that? That was a very brief bitflyer promotion way back when they first opened. I always pay fees.

None of that shit here, Japanese exchanges are the most regulated in the world.  FSA doesn't mess around.
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:49:50
Japan is not "so Bitcoin friendly". Tax up to 55%, every movement even to another wallet is a taxable event, you can't deduct losses but you're taxed on all gains, coins need to be whitelisted by government for exchanges to list them and it takes years of lobbying, etc.

Never heard of it.
