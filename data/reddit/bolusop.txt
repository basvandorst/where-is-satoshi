You know... I told this **myself**.
When I first heard about bitcoin I though I should get my hands on just a few. Maybe a few hundred or something. Not much. I told myself to buy some when it was at about 5$, when it was at about 10$, 20$... every few months or so I look into bitcoin and tell myself to buy some. But guess what? I never did.
Because I just don't have anything to invest.
I studied CS, so I heard about this pretty early on. A professor I know rather well was excited by this whole idea. But as a student you basically have not money. None. Then I aimed for my master's degree. Still no money. Then, even *before* I got my master's degree, my son was born, so we needed to move into a bigger house. Then, when I started to earn some money, my wife lost her job. Now we got our second child.
You know, our car's crappy. I have *no* savings at all. All the money I get at the start of the month is basically gone after three weeks. I'm telling myself that I simply invested into a family instead of technology, which is as fulfilling as I can imagine. I'm getting love instead of cash.
But still, I already imagine my children when they're turning 20 or something, asking me why I didn't just spend a *few* bucks on 'coins when I heard about them. As they'll probably be worth much more than a few thousand euros per 'coin.
I love to see the people just replacing the banks. But I shed a tear every time I see that it really takes of, kind of leaving me behind. I guess that's just the way it is, this was my chance and I blew it because I just couldn't afford to get it. Money just sticks to money, and if you've got none, you'll get none.
Oh well, 'nuff self-pity for today. Going back to work to pay for my crappy car.

Although I hate getting something for whining: Thanks :). I appreciate the gesture :). Still, with me not really having done anything and still not doing anything, it's kind of like [this]( only with buying BTC instead of thinking of a product.
Guess I have to think of a product that makes me earn some Bitcoin ;).

As I said, every now and then I spend a few euros on BTC. Still, 1000% gain on a tiny amount of money is still a tiny amount. Should just have kept mining two years ago :-/. As a CS student you basically have no money, but at least you always have some computers at your disposal.

Wouldn't we just... well, profit?

A core element of the banking system is that people can borrow money to buy something expensive (like a house etc.). Is there any institution that takes this part in the bit-universe? Like, a virtual bank where you can borrow BTC and just return them over time? I know you couldn't be anonymous, but that's not really the question.

I'm doing that. It's still different though... buying a cup of coffee is food. I eat that. I'll have to buy food anyway. So, even with some bills left for this month, I'll be buying food.
I can't just "not" buy food and buy some bit-cents instead... Because eventually, I'll have to buy that food anyway. And in this case it's kind of different. I feel like I have to pay my bills before I may spend excess money for investment stuff. I don't want to borrow money just to buy different money.
You know, I'm not even really angry. I'm thinking that I'll buy BTC and keep them for 20 years. By then, they'll either be worth some thousand bucks or nothing. Even at 140 $/BTC, I'm still an early bird ;).
But yes, if I've got some bucks I don't need, I'm buying coins. Simply because I believe in a free currency, whatever will happen to it.

Actually I don't. I didn't invest, so I don't deserve anything. That's life...

How come that this 21 million is thought of as a fixed upper limit? I know it is for BTC, but with more cryptocurrencies coming up, the amount of cryptomoney seems to be just as indefinite as "real" money which can be printed as much as needed.

bitcoin-24 still offers instant sign-up, doesn't it?

So I don't get anything? o_O
