I'd very much like to avoid that is possible, since it would mean downloading the whole blockchain again, which would take at least a couple of weeks..

I have been trying to upgrade my node for the last couple of days, but so far I haven't been successful.
Unfortunately my bitcoin core is stuck at the boot logo, it says: "rewinding blocks".
I have already tried restarting it, and now it has been running for almost 2 days straight...any help please?

Will do, thanks :)

Sorry, dynamic ip, and unfortunately I still don't have a setup to keep it on 24/7

Am I doing this right? [Imgur](

I personally use armory and it allows you to set a fee as low as you wish if you don't like the default one.
edit : and if I am not mistaken the bitcoin-qt wallet itself lets you set the fee. The only downside is that, although it is an added security (correct me if I'm wrong), with both wallets you need to download the whole blockchain.

Yeah the first time around will be slow as hell, but once it's downloaded it won't take long to start up.
If you can yes, I would suggest armory, awesome interface, perfect if you want to have cold storage on an old laptop or a bootable usb whilst having a watch-only wallet online and with this setup it doesn't take long to safely sign transactions(this is my setup). They also have an awesome support and recently introduced multi-signature.

Well then, I have some bitcoins in cold storage (armory on a xubuntu distro in a bootable usb, if it matters) do I have to worry? do I have to create another cold-storage unit and move there my bitcoins? And if it isn't necessary, should I somehow update the distro or am I safe and I can keep on using it?
Sorry, I am not a very tech-savy guy.
Thank you very much, any kind of advice will be greatly appreciated :)

Thank you for doing this, I recently started lurking around here and you gave me a (I'll admit selfish) reason to register...have a nice day kind sir, and a tip would obviously be greatly appreciated :)
@_date: 2014-07-12 06:19:54
Done, thank you. How long will the survey be up and will you publish the results here? 
Have a nice day...
@_date: 2014-09-01 17:18:45
Will do, thanks. Is it all right even if it can't stay on 24/7?

If global shipping is not an issue I would gladly help out with some testing (mac, windows, linux) :)
@_date: 2014-09-01 10:38:28
Nope no issues, it even shows up on  so I guess it's working correctly...
Here it is: [my node](
edit: what is that -activate nodes status- functionality? Nevermind, worked it out, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-09-26 07:46:32
Yep yep, it's all backed up, thanks again :) 
Have a nice day or night, wherever you are :)
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:09:01
Thanks a lot! :)

This is not mining, a node plays the role of relaying transactions across the network as far as I know. Theoretically I could be mining by running some commands on the console but it wouldn't be anywhere near...as profiting as an asic. Actually it just wouldn't be profitable. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 07:24:06
Thanks a lot! I feel slightly better now :)

And do you think I can keep on using it without getting in trouble?

Thanks for posting this...I have to say that Andreas is extremely eloquent, I might be falling in love :)
