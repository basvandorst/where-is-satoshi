This does not sound good - move, before the wind blows them over

Congratulations for your good work, I'm sure this will be fixed in the next few days. This is not good business practice, they may take a detoured way to fix it, but it will not be possible to obtain a name associated with an email any more.  Nice work, thanks!

I disagree, I'm an experimenter, nothing like trying it out to understand, nothing like trying to build it to see if it works, getting your hands dirty is not idiot in my point of view, but it may be in yours
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:45:25
the interest is just not there any more, and the goverments are getting involved and discouraging it, would be willing to take bets with fellows that you will see a price below 350.00 before the start of summer

bitcoin is joke - is what I understand
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:19:45
cavirtex is ok, also vaultofsatoshi.com and canadianbitcoins.com , have worked with all three without any issues, prefer vaultofsatoshi for most flexibility and value.

The art of throwing your money out the windows, so many innovative ways to do it...
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:36:03
Good luck, you will most likely get the boot before the limit

Little problem, you need to know the difficulty to calculate the cost of mining, you can not predict the difficulty, only estimate it.  So it's not a prediction it an estimation.
Secondly John claims the if it costed 1 million to mine a coin, the coin is worth one million, that is a false assumption.  The coin is only worth what ever someone is willing to pay for it, nothing, nothing else can determine it's value.  That's why if you try selling a 20.00 bill for 19.00, you will get a ton of buyers and none will pay 20.01 for it.  Just all pure logic.

Where are you located?
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:14:19
Hi, it has never happened to my knowledge, there would not be any conflict at all, it's just that the private key would be known by more than one person.
@_date: 2016-02-26 11:17:17
Let's see a screenshot
@_date: 2016-02-26 11:21:40
I get the headings and then a page of white with no data, still need to work on it.  
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:48:52
expect the price to touch 169.00 in less than 5 weeks, it's actually getting a bit sleepy lately
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:03:43
How would I do that?  I suppose I need to select a pool that supports segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:03:05
Any suggestions which pool I could move to, that would allow me to send payments say once a week?
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:48:03
ok - thanks - this advances my comprehension - I was under the believing that you could not easily do a typo, now I understand that this is true for public adrs, but certainly not for privates and blockchain.info's import button
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:55:34
Hi, You can check all transactions for a given address in the blockchain,  and enter 1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH in the address box, you will see all transactions
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:47:37
No no, that is fine, I left that as a christmas gift
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:29:32
Ok, here we go, original private key:
Modified that works:
At least when I import into a blockchain.info wallet

You can always put some stop sell orders to short it when you think it starts to drop, for example at about 320.00 USD and take profit at about 225.00, but this is risky, good luck.  I am working on a page at btcleverage.com I have used avatrade with success, for the moment.  You can drop me a line at btcleverage if you have questions, happy tradding, would so much like to tell you what to do, but unfortunately I'm in the same position as you (a lot of profit on paper, not too much in my hands)
edit: please note markets closed on weekends (at least for avatrade)
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:20:48
That is what I figured, so you think that when I import in my blockchain wallet, the software ignores the checksum instead of saying "invalid key"?
I'm not sure it's that simple, I'm saying this cause I had to type in a private key and did a few typos and it worked, but of course the address was not good, but if you just change the last character, generally it will work and generate the correct public adr.  In french I would say "Il y a anguille sous roche"
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:29:47
Hard to say,
If you look at bitcointicker.co and put it in 12hr mode, you will see high volume on the two successive dips, I think someone decided to cashout, and it's a good thing cause the ones who bought those coins will keep them until they get higher, most likely.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:35:19
ok - well I guess that explanation holds, I guess it would then be possible to have many different private adrs that generate the same public adr?
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:53:40
Hi,  I wrote a script that monitors the adr each 10 minutes, if ever they would decide to sell, they would have to move them, I would then anticipate a price drop and try to leverage it throught [
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:36:54
no, realy not - I don't feel any rage what so ever, I'm actually quite happy, bitcoin is a real di$covery for me
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:17:56
Interesting, let's look at this logicaly:
a) "if it is to go up, better hold on to your coins, they will be worth more later"
b) "If it is go down, better sell now, and buy later when lower, this way you will end up with more coins"
c) so it all boils down to deciding if it's going to go up or down
d) if you are reading this, you are not part of the ones who just leave it alone and forget about it, that is always an option
e) it is up to each individual to decide, I can not justify why, but I "feel", it will continue to drop into the new year, the main reason being that it is not welcome everywhere, it's a bit like the new neihbour who arrives and everyone finds cool and everything, but after a while, the interest goes away, being human is like that is the way we are
Best holiday season to all!

I am working on a page at  drop me a line at btcleverage if you have questions.
edit: please note markets at avatrade are closed on weekends
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:32:27
 but they are not open to US citizens, I can assist you if you have questions, pm or btcleverage good luck
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:43:39
Well, I was wrong - never quite made it, would this be the start of a down fall?
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:05:15
Nice post, does make a lot of sense, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:11:45
Well done!
