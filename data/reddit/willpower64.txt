I believed in bitcoin, told everyone about it for the past several years(belief isnt the best word, its simply highly likely to succeed), however unfortunately i was addicted to pot and spent literally an extra 2 grand per month on it in 2016 and every year before (approximately 1200 on food, 800 on pot) smoking copious amounts, only w pot and regular intense exercise can i eat that much- so i sold all of my 40 btc in 2016 to fund 'stoner munchies' and 'pot', last december i saw what i was doing to myself and quit a daily 14 year habit, so currently this has been the most productive year of my life and i wont smoke again til im 50 yo (currently 33) or have 200k in the bank.
in december im on pace for having 12 months of living expenses in savings (only about 10kusd as i can live off that if i needed to for 1 year) so i was kinda hoping btc wouldnt go up until dec 30 2017 when i could invest a lil bit and 50% of every penny earned after that date. 
Anyways my life is so much better bc i addressed the problem, quit pot, work more, spend less on food= so much more happier and productive and reaching more goals in my life, however missing out on the great crypto boom of 2017 is the one negative thing in my life, can you please give me some advice on how to not be upset about the fact that i could be retired right now and instead ive got to work 50 hour weeks for 16 years to make that money so i effectively cost myself 16 years of full time work and limited spending, kinda depressing
This is the year i take responsibility for everything in my life, and hopefully sets the foundation for the rest of my life, however i just needed the btc price to stay low til dec 30th, argh, please give me some advice?

its also worth mentioning that last december i literally had 120$ to my name,   ya it was 20$ per day average with a few 50ish dollar pot days thrown in just being excessive
i wasnt buying ounces, doing it the worst way, always thinking im quitting the next week
