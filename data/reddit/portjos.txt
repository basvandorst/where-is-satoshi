This kind of comment makes me so angry. In Australia we had limited options for available exchanges. Even if I wasn't forced to use Mt Gox, I shouldn't be taking any blame for other people's negligence.  Stop blaming the victims here.

If there's no regulation then what's to stop them lying to consumers about security, liquidity etc if there's no penalty or jail time for lying? Who's going to go in to look at their books if no one is legally allowed to have access to everything? What if there's not enough competition to force them to offer all of these checks?

Yes, I agree completely with everything you're saying here. I also regret not getting them out sooner but I hesitated too long due to concerns about computer security. Never thought such a large exchange would just stop operating and everyone would lose everything. Only lost less than a Btc but it still stings!

Good on you for developing open source software, we need more guys like you around. Please don't let this bad experience put you off.  You were just unlucky, like the rest of us who lost our bitcoins on Mt Gox.
