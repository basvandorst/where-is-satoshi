Haha, yeah I know how it looks...I'll post a pic with a sign saying "Hi Reddit!" lol - gotta do it for my other posts anyway :)

Also acceptable!

I thought it was more humorous than anything lol - I feel a bit ridiculous doing this, so my ridiculous sense of humor kicked in :P

I do. Particularly when I can see the outline of my slave's chastity device through his bathing suit! Most people don't notice...but I do!

I am Goddess Starla from Femdombride.com - I have worked with the creators of this site for years. I just wanted to throw my support behind this site, as I can say from my heart that they are good people.

Yep, this is a big deal in porn for lots of people...especially considering how many spouses ask what certain charges are when looking at a credit card bill lol...we bill very discreetly even when we process credit cards - however it still is a charge that shows and therefore must be explained.

lol...once you've seen a japanese girl get penetrated by an electric eel...you just can't go back to Playboy!
Edit: I don't have japanese girls being penetrated by electric eels on my site :P (Though I should look into that...)

oh but to answer your question, no, I only own my site :) There are thousands of DVDs in my site though, and there is a whole section for male domination.

That's wonderful to hear :) And the bitcoin discounts are pretty damn good if I do say so myself!
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:45:13
I do. Particularly when a beta male licks it off my feet.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:11:49
hahahahaha I lolirl'd
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:53:34

Here's my verification! :)

No Magic :) That's why I think our fans have become so attached to us. He actually is my husband. Our authenticity I feel is what sets us a bit apart from the crowd :)

wuuuuu that's so rad :D Thank you!!

in terms of piracy, yeah it could be one piece of the puzzle. Bitcoin's ability to do microtransactions could open up a whole lot of possibilities considering how difficult it is to do with traditional payment methods in adult.
Companies giving away 45 minute free HD movies with nothing required doesn't help either though lol ;)

Also I wouldn't mind turning this into a quasi-AMA if there's interest. Anyone have any questions? :P
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:51:45
hahaha thank you :D

I'm not always dominant by any means...in my lifestyle I appreciate male alpha "bulls" to enter the bedroom, and I do love them ;) There are a bunch of scenes in my site of me playing with my bulls while my husband watches!
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:28:44
I do. I enjoy star wars...a lot. albeit - it's better when I'm dominating someone. proof:
