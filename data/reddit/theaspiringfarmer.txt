hindsight is always 20/20. satoshi was a genius but unfortunately his vision was lost along the way...mostly by greed. the nature of the beast, i suppose. it's impossible for even a genius to have accurately understood the day when the "currency" was truly global and people were willing to fork up nearly 20K for a bitcoin. you can run a lot of analysis and speculation and graphs but until that happens you have no idea of the true impact and what a shitstorm you will have.

it's over in the short term. the jury's still out longer term. it's difficult to consider Bitcoin a "currency" when almost no one accepts it, and they charge such insane fees to move funds that every one just keeps it in their wallets. Bitcoin turned in to an investment vehicle which it was NEVER intended to be, a "get rich quick" scheme. to be brutally honest, i think this "crash" is **good** for Bitcoin. it's going to filter out a lot of flakes and "investors" and perhaps leave folks who believe in the technology and the actual purpose and vision behind Bitcoin. it can become stronger. what doesn't kill me only makes me stronger, ya know. just my observations. carry on.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:43:29
yeah, it's never a good thing when you start hearing names like goldman sach's floating around. they aren't there for the "currency" or the "vision" and while these big banks and investment vehicles publicly trashed bitcoin and the others they were pumping and now dumping massive amounts of cash. it's all about the fiat as they say.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:40:44

well when it got to be a group of old ladies sitting around hawking bitcoin investments you knew the whole thing was going to shit. saw and heard a million such anecdotes the last few months. you're right, a lot of people who have no knowledge (or even interest) in the technology just looking to make a buck - including the big banks and investment houses ("whales") and when they started pumping and then dumping this was inevitable. i hope bitcoin recovers but frankly i'm less optimistic than ever before; there's too much competition now. other cryptos have superior tech and are more nimble and fluid...more importantly, they can actually be used as "currency" and without $30 transaction fees for a $2 soda. just some more of my musings.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:44:04
or cutting their losses. it's all a matter of perspective.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:23:43
no one...they're all selling. HODL is a myth...the whales use it to get the suckers reeled in. 60% isn't a "correction" guys. just saying.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:50:27
eventually. once you (lose) enough.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:45:32
does BTC bought at less than 100 USD per and sold at over 19,000 USD per qualify? (asking for a friend)
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:12:08
well the fees are very high, that's probably why. i've seen as much as 13-14% premium which is just nuts. convenience, yes, but the premiums are way too high. i'm not familiar with this particular company or bashing any one company in particular - just in general. bitcoin ATMs are pricey.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:27:50
"Of course, investing into the technology (and not for the profit) is a different discussion."

because it's different you see --- **they** invented those other things. just like it's supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:51
people are sheep. when they start to lose, they panic. i will guarantee that a pretty significant percentage of the "HODL" group here was dumping their BTC the moment they saw it drop. after all, a few xmas gifts under the tree are better than "lost" money right? so do I think this phenomenon played (and is playing) a significant role here? yes. absolutely. are there many other factors? yes. but to ignore the obvious is foolhardy.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:17:18
props sir - you're 100% spot on and accurate in your assessment here.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:49:33
or (far more likely) the guy who panic sold at 10.5K after purchasing all he could muster at 19.6K a week earlier. :P
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:41:58
and that's the problem here! bitcoin was not created as an investment! it was never intended to be used as an investment vehicle. and so long as people continue to see it that way and utilize it that way, it's dead, for all practical purposes. sure i like to profit. but i'd much rather see bitcoin (and other cryptos) succeed as what they are intended to be - actual currencies. it would change the world, if only people would use it for things other than an "investment". do you not see and comprehend this?
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:03:01

@_date: 2017-12-27 10:48:21
mistake  you are not a "bitcoin investor". i predict dark, dark times ahead my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:14:50
exactly this! i'm sick and tired of hearing about BTC vs USD and the only thing any one cares about is how many USD their BTC is worth. bitcoin will never be mainstream and useful if that is the logic. sad.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:40:06
fair enough, they're probably the same folks who stand (staring) at the payment terminal in the super market wondering precariously if the proper choice on the screen is "credit" or "debit" when they swipe their card. though it's difficult to imagine such peons being invested in BTC, it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility with the explosion of interest and buzz it has begun to garner.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:47:13
then perhaps you shouldn't be speculating with money you need? i'm still shocked how many people are gambling with their lives (literally) in bitcoin. if you can't afford to speculate, don't do it. and if you "need that money..." --- you can't afford to be doing it. period.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:10:25
right. and the "volatility" of bitcoin can be explained in direct correlation to this. these large scale movements are caused by huge investment whales moving (or, rather, dumping - or pumping) large amounts of cash in to, or out of, bitcoin. it's not the little guy around here with his 0.015BTC that's causing this effect. every one here seems to believe Wall Street and the bankers are oblivious and totally asleep at the wheel, beyond throwing up a few drapes and opening a trading desk for show. let me assure you that the likes of Jamie Dimon and so forth are moving ridiculous amounts of fiat cash through in an two-faced attempt to both crash bitcoin and make a lot of money doing it. Wall Street wasn't just an 80's film.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:30:04
it's not so much needing the money "to live" but really needing the money at all. one should never be investing funds they need in any sense, in bitcoin or any thing else. that's the problem here, along with people just looking to make a quick buck and get out. for all the "HODL" talk here and elsewhere, it's amazing that there's any BTC being sold. unless they're all hypocrites, which seems to be more likely than not.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:06:38
i don't disagree with your euphemisms and enthusiasm but i offer one meager tangent of warning: beware, and i mean beware, of those who proffer to "rid" you of those evils you speak. there is no honor amongst thieves.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:11
sure mate. sell. i'm buying. only a sucker gets scared and if you're scared, get out. just some advice.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:09:54
i've literally heard from a large number of people who admit, they need the coin for holiday shopping or entertainment or family events etc for Christmas. so it's not a far-fetched idea. one would *think* that someone who invests in bitcoin has a little more brains than that but emotion and reason go right out the window when the thought of "losing" money is thrown in to the mix.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:03:59

I said debit, not credit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:23:29
actually less than 0.1BTC truth be told, and yes, the vast majority.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:22:45
yeah well they better do something. raise the difficulty and adjust it proportionally for the time decrease or whatever. the $30 fees can't continue if bitcoin wants to remain viable in any sense of the word.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:14:32
until bitcoin (and crypto coins in general) are recognized properly as currency, rather than some "investment" like a stock, bond, or mutual fund (or even silver or gold bars, etc) - it will continue to be nothing but a get rich quick scheme. if your only notion of the "value" of a bitcoin is how many USD that coin is worth right this moment, then it's toast. and i'm afraid that's pretty much where we sit. the true value of these "alternative currencies" is their potential and use as actual currencies - which no one seems to have any concept nor requirement or use case for. just a bunch of people looking to pump and dump, ride the dip and sell the tide and retire to a white sand beach sipping martini's for life.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:20
you don't sound the slightest bit confident, so my recommendation is to sell and get out. if you need people tossing "math" around to "make you feel better" - you shouldn't be here in the first place.

there are bitcoin debit cards, many of them. and they've been around for some time. that's not really the issue, more of a scape goat that people toss around to justify the current "get rich quick" mentality that is so pervasive it's toxic and perhaps even fatal. bitcoin is a currency and until people appreciate and utilize it as such, rather than some "investment vehicle", we're in for a really bumpy ride. it's really sad. predictable, unfortunately, but sad.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:59:51
actually a lot of very wealthy people do indeed hold significant amounts of fiat cash. it's more a status symbol than some magic hedge against inflation. and when you reach that point, it really doesn't matter.

oh sure, it's definitely governments/nation states and banks in those places doing the same thing. every one has a motive and an incentive. for some, it's to kill bitcoin. others just want a quick buck. some want both, of course. my point remains though, regardless of who is pushing the buttons on the other side: these massive swings are pure market manipulation by very large stake holders, not "panic" from regular Joe's or even lots of regular Joe's at once. all together they don't hold enough BTC to move the market a small fraction of what we've seen. these are big fish. very big fish.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:54:38

never invest what you can't afford to lose. and assume you may lose every last cent. that's the nature of the beast. i think it's safe to say the only ones "panicking" did not have the money to be investing in the first place. sometimes you learn the hard way, and you'll be stronger for it.
bought the majority of my BTC below 4000 and if it drops to absolutely zero, i'll not lose any sleep over it. i have a lot of other investments and BTC is just another on a long list. admittedly, i'm partial to it, because i'm a real fan of the principle and the technology of the blockchain etc.

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:38:08
it's not really that hard to imagine a few big banks and financial institutions with hundreds of millions, even billions, of dollars sitting at the ready to manipulate markets. they do it regularly, and they do it so easily it's child's play. the more difficult part is masking it to any degree to create the illusion of a ground swell. yes, it's basically financial astroturfing and if you don't think the big wall street banks and the other large financial institutions are doing precisely this on a massive scale every day...you're just naive. the amount of money and resources necessary to swing a market with a cap over 300 billion USD is well beyond the reach of even a "panic swell" of small BTC investors. it's not even close. the massive movement we regularly see requires a massive financial purse which only a small handful of places have at the ready, to move markets as they wish, and do.

first of all, the process takes longer than 5 minutes. and the bartender isn't working for free. time is money and being penny wise and pound foolish puts a lot of businesses to an early death. also they aren't paying $100 on $2000 it's more like $60 to $75 tops and of course will vary based on the size of the establishment and how many transactions they process daily etc.

well, that, and the fact that the value fluctuates so rapidly and regularly that it's impossible to assuage an actual "value" for these types of transactions. say what you will about fiat currency; it fluctuates too, and can crash. but not nearly to the extremes and regularity we see with bitcoin. i'm a fan of the technology, own some bitcoin, but certainly don't see it becoming useful for day-to-day stuff let alone replacing fiat currency. it's a niche for nerds and enthusiasts. the 20K run-up was the big money pumping and dumping which was to be expected, i mean come on, goldman sachs? lol. they sure weren't looking for an investment.

wrong, at least in your overall theory. yes, big banks and financials *have* driven the price down - *after* they bought in and drove the price sky-high and then sold everything and took the huge profits. pump and dump. it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that the big guys like goldman saks aren't interested in tech or blockchain or any of that. it's all $ and when i saw them going "all in" it was obvious the sham was up.
