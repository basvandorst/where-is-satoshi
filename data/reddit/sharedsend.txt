This is one of our responses from Bitcointalk which covers most of the questions and feedback from this thread:
Thank you all for your feedback! Please let us say that we welcome any feedback, positive or negative, we know this is the first step when a service is started within the bitcoin community. We are active members from the beginning (we can not disclose our identities due to the nature of our service) and we know that a lot of scammers are building sites and services similar to ours but we strongly urge the community to refrain from making strong accusations about our service until a reasonable amount of users begin using our service.
Please don't forget that this is the starting phase of our site so a few problems will eventually appear but we welcome any feedback and idea to make our service the best it can be.
We will try to answer every question and accusation:
 - Donation address: Bitcoins which are donated to this address will be added to the mix (we didn't think this would be a problem or a warning) and the address in which users send bitcoin to be cleaned is the same for other users. This address is changed at random intervals but it just happened to be the same as the donation address.
 - The 1-2% fee: We know that other services similar to ours are practicing lower fees but we have invested a great deal of work and money into this project and we hope we can recover this investment in the following month or two. The fee will be lowered to 0.5%-1% as soon as possible.
 - Long waiting time: We can not promise to send the BTC in under 6 hours because the process is validated manually 2-3 times in 24 hours and some users request the delay option which means the required BTC will be sent only when enough new bitcoins have been added to the mix. We would like to note that some bitcoins are added as freshly mined (about 2-3 a day) and we plan to (when we start making larger profits) add a lot of miners which add at least 10 very clean BTC/day (this will be optional with a larger fee). We are also working on finding miners from which we can buy btc on a regular basis with a small fee given to the miners. The cleaning process will be faster by the day, hopefully we will guarantee a maximum of 3 hours in the following 2 months.
 - Trust: We have no possible way of making the community trust us until we have a large user-base.
 - SSL: Our SLL certificate has been installed correctly and it has been tested on all browsers including Chrome, it should work without problems. Please give more details about your error.
 - Maximum deposit: We do not want to make any accusations about other services which claim to have a maximum cap of 2000 BTC but from our experience, that service will eventually run with the BTC when a significant amount has been added to the mix. 2000 BTC means about 1mil$ which we can say with almost absolute certainty that no service can put this much BTC as initial reserve (this should be very clear to everyone, please don't trust the service just because a large number of users have used it without problems, this can be an elaborate scheme to steal as much btc as possible). The fact is users can deposit sums greater than 100btc (even 200-300) but this could take too long to clean so we encourage users to send no more than 100 to be 100% sure that the cleaning process won't take more than 24 hours and the BTC will be as clean as possible. The limit is 100 because this is the amount we could invest as an initial reserve of clean bitcoins so users which deposit amounts lower than 100 will be guaranteed to receive clean bitcoins in a reasonable time.
- Site template: Our template and design is completely different form bitmixer and other similar services. We assure you that our site has been built from the ground up without using any elements from other site. You may see similarities only because our team has researched the competition to see what users are used to find on this kind of services.
- Laundry: Some users are not happy with us using words like laundry or launder. If the community request this, we will change this words to 'clean' or 'process'.
