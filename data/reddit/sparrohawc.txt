Ah, but Bitcoins are only mined where the power is cheapest.  It is in places where there is a *surplus* of electricity.
Power plants are built in places with an expectation of future need.  The cost to build those power plants needs to be recouped at some point.  In the meantime, though, there is all this electricity capacity going completely unused - which means it's sold cheap.  Bitcoin steps in and makes that electricity more valuable.  In essence, it's performing electricity arbitrage.
Sure, for coal-fired plants and oil plants, that means more pollution - but coal and oil are slowly being phased out *because they cost more than green alternatives*.  Eventually it won't matter who's using how much electricity, environmentally speaking.

Doubtful.  The hubs are just one entry point to the network among many possible nodes.  Ideally your lightning wallet would have one connection to a very well-connected hub, and a few channels to other decentralized nodes that also have a few connections to other nodes to make a mesh network, taking advantage of the six degrees of separation principle.  That way there's always a method to route around problem nodes, even if the 'problem node' is a huge hub.

Yes.  The network doesn't *depend* on those centralized nodes; you can fire your own up without having to connect to it, and if the centralized nodes go down they won't take the network with it.  They just happen to make a lot of routes shorter, so they can collect the miniscule transaction fees.

That's how LND works.  Not every LN wallet does that, nor should it.  Different use cases demand different topologies.  Right now these are essentially test wallets, so people are tinkering with them in whatever way makes sense to them at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:58:54
That depends on the LN wallet.  There's more than one way to skin a cat; it's possible some people might *want* to only connect to a single hub despite the risk of it going down, while others would want to use a mesh network.  The thing is, the protocol doesn't force one or the other - just like how SPV wallets only connect to the one node instead of a bunch of nodes like a full-node wallet does.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:36:43
Yup.  That's the risk of only connecting to a hub, and they probably made that decision with their eyes open to that fact.

1. Make sure your Trezor has the 1.5.2 firmware.
1. Launch the Trezor.io webapp, plug in your Trezor.
1. Click "+ Add Account" on the left.
1. Click "Receive".  Make sure the address starts with a 3 instead of a 1.
This address is a Segwit address.  Any coins you receive to that address will use Segwit when you send them out.

The fun thing I just realized is that, since there was nothing backing Bitcoin to begin with, it has to compete with other currencies based *entirely on its merits*.
Actual fraud would be revoking the gold standard for an established currency.  Suddenly the government no longer has to worry about keeping all this gold around - they can do whatever they want with it!
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:54:30
OKAY SO


This is grossly misrepresenting the value of currency.  Currency has value *because* it is a standardized medium of exchange.  It's essentially a middle-layer for a barter system.  You exchange goods or services for dollars, then exchange those dollars for goods or services instead of having to trade goods you have for goods you want.  Because it performs this service, *cash has intrinsic value* - even if it doesn't have any value beyond being a medium of exchange.  It is an easy way to 'transform' value.
In some senses, cash is better than Bitcoin because it has zero requirements to use, as long as you can hold a dollar bill in your hand.  However, cash is useless for transferring value *over long distances,* across political boundaries that use different currencies, et cetera.  For many years, banks fulfilled this purpose by allowing you to store money in their system and then transfer this money to someone else without having to actually carry the cash.
The downside is that you have to depend on the bank, and banks have proven repeatedly that they work only in their own best interest, not in yours.  Sometimes the best thing for them is to convince their customers otherwise, but the bottom line is that banks are in it *for themselves*.  They are also beholden to the governments in whose borders they operate, which means your assets can be frozen or taken from you if the government decides you don't deserve them.  In essence, *money in a bank does not belong to you; it belongs to the bank.*  In fact, the money that you store in a bank is used to pay out loans - so those dollars that you deposited yesterday might very well be in someone else's pocket tomorrow.  But in order to transmit money over distances, you MUST use a bank.  ...until Bitcoin came around.
Now you can perform for yourself the service that banks once had a monopoly on.  If you ever paid money to a bank to wire money to someone else, you did exactly the sort of thing that Bitcoin was MADE to do, *without* depending on someone else holding your assets for you.  Wiring money usually takes some sort of fee.  Generally speaking, sending Bitcoin requires less fees, requires no bank, and cannot be interfered with by any other entity.
No, Bitcoins themselves do not have anything 'backing' them.  WE ALL KNOW THIS.  Don't even bother trying to tell us this as if it's some sort of new revelation.  WE KNOW.  But the dollar is still worth what you can buy with a dollar, because we accept it as a method of exchange.  The exact same thing goes for Bitcoin - especially since there is a *very real cost to mining Bitcoin*.  The advantages that Bitcoin gives over both cash and keeping your money in a bank are what gives it its *intrinsic* value.  Its extrinsic value is, just as with everything else, only what people will pay for it.  The intrinsic value, however, is why I like Bitcoin.


Bitcoin has more than just the first mover advantage.  It has the highest evaluated value at the moment, the largest market cap, the most transactions, arguably the most competent dev team, the biggest network, the most miners.  The dev team in particular has repeatedly made it clear that they cannot be bought, they listen to the community at large, they are deeply invested in the future of Bitcoin, and they have weathered numerous attacks with flying colors (often by calmly doing nothing).  I trust the dev team, and so, I trust Bitcoin.  For examples of cryptos I don't trust because of the development team and/or their actions, take a look at Bcash.


The amount of Bitcoin is fixed.  However, the number of *spendable* Bitcoins will invariably go down as people lose or destroy their private keys.

U.S. dollars today are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. Government.
In other words, nothing but hopes and dreams.
The main hazard with a currency being too highly valued is, yes, that people will hoard it.  The less there is in circulation, the harder it is to find pennies to use as a medium of exchange.
The main thing that makes Bitcoin different in that respect is that there will *never be too little Bitcoin in circulation* because Bitcoin can always be divided into smaller and smaller bits (possibly with some adjustment to the protocol, but that's to expected.  Satoshi even brought it up in the whitepaper if I remember correctly.)
The thing that makes Bitcoin *worse* is that there is limited room on the ledger, and you have to pay for the privilege of having your transaction included on the network.  That's where there is room for sidechains, Lightning network, altcoins, et cetera.

Mainly that the government couldn't just print more money; there was a fixed supply, and they'd have to mine or otherwise acquire more gold to cover any printed bills.

The US dollar used to be backed by gold.  You could turn in your dollar bill, ten dollar bill, or hundred dollar bill for actual hard metal coinage.  This meant every dollar had to have enough gold somewhere to cover it.  That's the "gold standard" - a certain amount of money gives you the right to a certain amount of gold.
Then the gold standard was revoked.  Now, you can no longer turn in your dollars for gold.  That means the government doesn't have to keep the gold around in case people turn in their dollar bills.
Every single dollar bill from that point on was no longer debt in the part of the government.  With one stroke, the government suddenly had a huge pile of gold that belonged only to them.

Although you are technically correct, you can buy things with money in a bank without issue 99.999% of the time.  The same goes for BTC held by Coinbase on your behalf.  It's all well and good to say you can only trust yourself with your bitcoins, but as has been proven time and time again, non-tech-savvy people do not readily have access to secure methods of storing bitcoin while still having the capability of easily spending them.
Coinbase has already taken the effort to secure their systems.  Letting them hold onto your BTC means you're offloading a lot of the responsibility of security in exchange for giving up direct control of your BTC.
You can still take advantage of *every other benefit* of Bitcoin - push transactions, low fees, store of wealth, divisibility, et cetera.
Also, Coinbase *never* does anything with your BTC.  They aren't like a bank where they take your money and lend it out to other people; a run on Coinbase would result in everyone getting their BTC.  In that sense, you have MUCH more control over your BTC when it's in Coinbase's possession than you do your money at the bank.

The crooks and scammers do not run the 'infrastructure'.  They run some of the services that are available to people who use Bitcoin.
The infrastructure suffered a setback when the blockchain split.  The people who are essentially in charge of the infrastructure offered a fix, and the people who really are in charge of the infrastructure (the Bitcoin miners) implemented it.  That's the last time there was a problem with it.

You are trading your bitcoins for an item that has its value denominated in USD.  When you get a return, you will get a return for the same value denominated in USD.  It's not such a hard concept.  They are buying BTC from you with a fridge.
Exchanges don't let you go 'Oh wait the price went up, give me my bitcoins back and I'll give you the money I paid back.'  It's the same thing here.  Upon spending your BTC you NO LONGER HAVE THE BTC.  You have an object that is worth a certain amount of USD.

@_date: 2015-05-27 02:50:44
Except that while nodes are DOWNLOADING that 5TB block, a 1MB block comes in and gets validated in the meantime, and gets passed along.  Propagation happens much faster with the 1MB block, and after that gets some more blocks on the chain, the nodes ditch the 5TB block because it's the shorter chain before it's even done downloading.  All you have achieved is soaking up some network time and annoying some node maintainers.
Unless you can mine a bunch of new blocks based on that 5TB chain and pass along those transactions as well, you're not going to get anywhere.  The 5TB block isn't even going to get passed along to other nodes because it hasn't even arrived completely.  The blockchain will achieve consensus on the longer chain without the 5TB block.  Maybe some of the nodes will actually bother to download and try to verify the 5TB block, but it's not going to bring the network to its knees by any stretch of the imagination.
The real cap on block size is whether or not another smaller block gets mined while the big block is downloading.

A DoS attack that consisted of a single gigantic block wouldn't get anywhere because another smaller block would download and verify in the meantime, before the gigantic block ever got passed along to other nodes.  Network speed is the true block size cap.  You have to download a block entirely to verify it.

I doubt it too, but it doesn't keep me from being hopeful.
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:34:30
They can be valid blocks, but if the nodes can't even finish downloading it before another block comes in and validates, they're useless.  Sure, you might be able to DoS some nodes that aren't smart enough to ditch a download that obviously has old data, but you'd only be able to do that for as many nodes as you can manage simultaneous uploads to, and only if you can actually keep a connection to that node up for the entire 5TB upload.
The important factor to consider here is *consensus*.  A mined block, whether it is 5TB or 10KB, needs to reach enough of the network that it gets added to by nodes that mine blocks later on.  The node that mines the new block has to actually *have* the block for it to be included in its chain, and if most of the nodes don't have that block, it's going to get orphaned and everyone will ditch it.

Sorry to necropost, but I saw this in my old comment replies and I was stymied anew.
One of the reasons I like BTC is because it allows me to actually send a discrete amount of money instead of giving someone the keys to the castle and just trust that they'll only take the amount of money they say they will.
You are saying that it's obvious that you would pay for something with fiat though.  Can you explain why?  Is it the consumer protections that credit companies provide?

The one patent there that is even sort-of applicable isn't describing a Lightning channel, it's describing a sidechain.

It's viable as long as you keep your books up to date.
You know how much you spent to get your BTC, and you know how much you got when you sold / spent your BTC.  It's no worse than keeping a check ledger.

Yes, it would.  The point, though, is that everyone *could* run a full mining node.
There is, of course, no guarantee that the PoW wouldn't be optimized... but if the PoW was changed once to re-incentivize CPU mining, what company would make an ASIC for it when the PoW could be changed out from underneath them again?

If not for the fact that Bitcoin serves more uses than simply speculation, I would say yes.
However, Bitcoin does far more than that.  It is intrinsically valuable as a store of value and a means of exchange in addition to being a vehicle for speculation.

SegWit was only just adopted.  Up until that point, transaction malleability made LN a huge risk.  Resistance to SegWit delayed implementation of LN.  So no, it hasn't been years.  I suspect we'll start seeing LN implementations in the next couple months; there's a lot of prestige (and potentially money) in being the first reputable LN hub.
At the moment we *don't know* what will happen with fees.  Huge consolidated mining coalitions seem to be wreaking havoc with the market right now, pushing fees higher as much as possible in order to reap them when others are forced to pay the increased rates.  If we can manage to overcome that speed bump, we'll be in a much better position to see what the actual fee market looks like.

With BTC though, the longest chain is *de facto* the chain with the most work, thanks to how the difficulty adjusting works.  If you want to drop the difficulty, you need to spend a while mining blocks more slowly - which eliminates any benefit you might gain from slowly ramping up the difficulty and getting faster blocks that way.

Other miners collecting the high-fee spam only works if they broadcast to the rest of the network.  If they keep the transactions to themselves and only publish them with the blocks they mine, then they never run the risk of having to pay someone else.
Mind you, this is just a theory.  I don't know how the fees are determined in most wallets, and it's possible only a handful of high-fee transactions would skew the wallets, which would make the attacks fairly cheap even if other miners could mine the fees.

So if I understand right, if a block takes 12+ hours to mine, the difficulty drops by 25% (or 20%, I'm not sure which) and that difficulty drop can compound if subsequent blocks take longer than 12 hours.
What's to prevent a pool with some minimal mining threshold from separately mining a hidden chain slowly, triggering the 12-hour difficulty adjustment every block, and then once the difficulty is low enough, cranking up the hashrate to blast through the next big bunch of blocks and overtaking the "main" chain, and thus unfairly taking all of the mining rewards for that period?
Unless I'm mistaken, this sort of attack would require a minimal amount of hashpower to pull off.

Whoever told you that you can send money for free around the world was wrong.  On the other hand, you CAN send money for a much *lower* fee than most methods of transferring fiat.

Well - it costs to open the channel, and then it costs again to close it.  But the fun thing about Bitcoin is that the *value* of a transaction is utterly meaningless.  The amount of *data* in a transaction is what costs the network, and hence what drives transaction fees.

The UI can't be private, since users need to see it.  Only the underlying code.  As for why a company would keep the underlying code private, there are a few possibilities.
1.  They think their code is intrinsically valuable and don't want anyone else stealing it.  That's the main reason companies don't release their source code; if it's open source, they can't really sell it.
1.  They're embarrassed to let anyone else see it.  A lot of people suspect this is one of the main reasons Microsoft is so finicky about letting anyone else see the source code to Windows.
1.  Security through obscurity.  This one is just plain dumb.  If no one can see the code, no one else can find flaws in it - or so they think.  In reality, it's always possible to disassemble code since your computer has to be able to run it, and programs get hacked every day whether or not they're open source.  If it's open source though, anyone can fix it, and often fixes occur the same day the flaw is revealed.  If it's closed source, you're at the mercy of the company that wrote the software to fix it, if and when they ever get around to it.

More to the point, Satoshi was expecting people to be CPU mining, making use of their spare CPU cycles to secure Bitcoin.

All LN is, is a way to delay settling a transaction until the final BTC amount is decided upon or time runs out.  That's *all* it is.
You don't need to hand private keys over to anyone.  You don't need to centralize if you make a LN channel into a decentralized web of LN users who agree to shift numbers around to increase liquidity for everyone in the web, and you can verify for yourself that everyone is playing nice by passing the transaction updates around to all web participants (essentially a side-chain).  There is a slight risk of someone taking the BTC and running, but if you're using it for microtransactions, they only get $5 (or whatever) out of it and are denied the use of the LN web afterwards.

Why not?  You keep track of all your transactions anyways through your bitcoin wallet.  All you have to do in addition to that is keep track of what you bought - or just the dollar value of what you bought.
Or have an app of some sort that keeps track for you.
And again, the government really doesn't care that much about small dollar value ups and downs.  It's only if you start seeing gains in the hundreds of dollars in a year that it becomes important.
Edit:  I should mention that in the case of a business, it is absolutely a requirement to keep track of all your incoming and outgoing dollar flow to pay taxes.  This isn't so different.  It's a potential source of income; hence, you need to pay taxes on it.

Except they only take the highest-fee TXes and leave all the slightly-lower fee TXes after cramming their block full the rest of the way with their own high-fee TXes.  The wallets all see that only high-TX fees are being included, and tell the users that they need their fee to be at that fee or higher.  Since the malicious miners hold such a huge percentage of the hashrate, there's not enough good actors to bleed out the mempool between the crammed blocks.

Bad miners mine fewer lower-fee transactions because they are spamming their own blocks with high-fee transactions that they don't have to pay for because they mined it themselves.  They lose out on the fees of the transactions that they edge out with their own transactions, but they make up for it with the higher overall fees.  In essence, they are performing a denial-of-service attack against low-fee transactions.  They are *eliminating* the space that would be filled with low-fee transactions.
Fixing wallet advice would go a long ways towards fixing the problem, yes.  It's only miners' faults because they are exploiting the algorithm by artificially forcing out low-fee transactions.

SegWit adoption isn't universal yet, and the blocks are still limited to 1MB non-witness data.  As long as miners find it profitable to do so, they can spam the network with high-fee transactions, pushing out everyone who doesn't crank up the fees.  As long as the number of other people paying the higher fees is greater than the number of transactions they're wasting, they come out ahead.

If a valid but incorrect receiving address was generated, there is no reasonable way to generate the private key that the address belongs to.  Those coins are gone forever.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:06:50
It only works with BCH, because of the hash drop protection.  Here's the attack plan...
You need enough hash power to generate a block within 12 hours, at a difficulty slightly lower than the current difficulty.  Once the 12 hours are up, you "publish" that block to a private chain, which is now valid because more than 12 hours have passed and the lower difficulty comes into play, and begin working on the block after that, and when you find a block, hang onto it again until 12 hours have passed.  Since the 12-hour mark has hit, the difficulty lowers *again*.  "Publish" that block to your little private chain, and repeat the process.
Following this pattern, once four days have passed, the network difficulty is one-tenth what it was previously.  Another four days drops it to one-hundredth.  
Normally, difficulty adjustments occur every two weeks; this would permit you, with 25% of the network hashrate, to complete all 2016 blocks in a difficulty adjustment period within ten days, after which you *actually* publish that chain (which is the longest chain, now) and claim all the BCH mined block rewards (and transaction fees if you're listening to the network).  With 10% of the hashrate, you could do the same in 12 days on average.  The difficulty then adjusts based off of these poisoned metrics, and the blockchain becomes a winner-takes-all melee where only the pool with the greatest hashrate has any chance of keeping any BCH that they mined.

The problem is when a pool adds (but does not transmit to the rest of the network) transactions to their own blocks with high transaction fees.

If it were possible to make a PoW that used almost all features of modern CPU's, and users used their spare CPU cycles to mine like they did when Bitcoin was first introduced, it would be really, REALLY secure.

If the world over started using Bitcoin *or* Litecoin *or* Bitcoin Cash or even Dogecoin for everyday transactions, the amount of transactions would require huge datacenters just to hold the blockchain.  Bitcoin will likely continue to be the 2,000-pound gorilla, but other cryptos that are engineered specifically for daily-transaction style money-handling will begin to fill that niche once the demand for it increases.
Right now, we're still stuck in a fiat world.  Bitcoin is breaking barriers that others will follow in the wake of.
Personally, I suspect Litecoin LN nodes will pick up the slack when that happens.

What I'd like to know is why miners aren't bailing on AntPool *en masse*.  It's clear that AntPool isn't acting in the miners' best interests by leaving transactions on the table, and thus, keeping $$ from the miners.  Any other pool is going to be more beneficial to mine.

Still cheaper than wiring money.
For mass adoption as an everyday currency, yes, we need low fees.  For it to be profitable to mine, though, does not depend on how inexpensive its fees are as long as the actual exchange value remains high.  Once Segwit is implemented, it'll help relieve the pressure on the blocks, and if we can convince people to stop stuffing the mempool for potential personal gain, that'll help even more.

Isn't the bitcoin hashrate pretty much *always* spiking to an all-time high?  Just one really huge spike that keeps going up (on average)?
Now, if you told me how *fast* the hashrate was climbing was at an all-time high, that .... still wouldn't mean much, because ASIC mining rigs are constantly improving, so the hashrate will tend to rise at an increasing rate until we hit the bleeding edge of chip manufacturing technology.

That depends on whether or not the exchange allows you to transfer BCH.  Most don't; you're probably out of luck as the BCH belong to them, not you.  For that matter, you don't really own your BTC as long as they are on an exchange.  You have an IOU instead.

1.  Banks will always have the capability of interfering with bitcoin unless it becomes so large that it eclipses individual economies, simply because banks have such ridiculous amounts of capital to hand.
1.  Hoarding bitcoin is, in and of itself, useless.  Its purpose is to act as a medium of exchange, not just a store of value.  Our unifying objective as a community is to push for adoption of bitcoin by more people than just investors; we want to be able to *spend* bitcoin everywhere because it's a decentralized digital currency that allows the end-user to directly spend instead of relying on a third-party to hold your funds.  It's great that the dollar value of BTC is climbing, but *only because that increases the interest of the general public, and by extension, vendors*.  I still want to be able to pay for goods with my BTC because I trust BTC much more than Paypal, and THAT is what drives my interest in bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-20 18:56:13
No matter how much drama there is about forking the client, the bitcoins you currently hold will not go away.
The 'other' camp is the one that is primarily interested in making BTC accepted in more places - in other words, making it an easily liquidated asset.  This will make BTC more valuable and, as a knock-on benefit, make the Bitcoin network itself more valuable.  Increasing block size may make fewer people willing to throw hardware at such a disk-hungry client, making the network slightly more vulnerable to attack.  Leaving block sizes small will make transactions take longer eventually, meaning liquidity will decrease.
Personally I don't care; things will be sorted out eventually and in the meantime I still have BTC in my wallet.

@_date: 2017-11-16 06:36:44
I still expect that at some point in the near future instead of the far future, segwit transactions will become the norm.  Probably when the core wallet implements it, which really shouldn't be very far off.  I also believe that we will see more on-chain *and* off-chain scaling solutions as they become more necessary, some of which are likely to need hard forks.  No, they won't solve every problem, and you're right that LN won't cover every eventuality, but when BCH isn't robbing hashrate we still get pretty cheap transactions - especially if you use segwit.
That said, I respect your opinion and I don't feel it's wrong.  My opinion just differs a bit.

If you have a synced client somewhere, import the wallet.dat file for the wallet that owns the coins into that client.  It will check through the blockchain to find out how much that wallet owns, and it'll show up once it's done as spendable BTC.

Bitcoin Gold is switching the PoW algorithm to something that works with GPU mining.  The idea is that it eliminates the influence of mining cartels in favor of the users doing their own mining, but the pre-mine thing makes it look too much like a cash grab for it to get off the ground imho.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:28:40
XT coins are a misnomer.  There is no such thing.  There are only Bitcoins.
Eventually, if Bitcoin XT goes live (which it will only do if it makes up 75% of the network) everyone else will have to upgrade, or they will be spending their mining power on blocks that don't verify on the longest blockchain.  The longest blockchain is the only blockchain that matters.  That's how Bitcoin was designed.  Since 75% of Bitcoin miners will be on XT at that point, it would be foolish to stay on the old version, because it will be clear that a majority of users will be expecting you to use the XT client.
If 75% of the userbase DOESN'T switch to the Bitcoin XT client, nothing will happen and everything will keep chugging along exactly as it is now.
Bitcoins you buy now will be fine.  The XT client works just fine with current Bitcoins, and it will continue to do so until the switchover happens.  If/when the switchover happens, all you need to do is grab the new client - if you haven't already - and you will continue to be able to use the network just like you could before.

Yes, they can run a full node.  A RasPi is a pretty impressive little computer, all told.  Plus there's the possibility of caching the mempool to the drive.  RasPi's keep getting better, too - have you seen the specs for version 3?  It has a full gig of RAM, and frankly you don't need to hang onto the entire mempool - just the ones that are likely to get included in blocks in a reasonable amount of time.  For that matter, all a node needs to do is pass along transactions, not keep them in memory.
I'm not expecting an original version 1 Raspberry Pi to run a full node, no.
The intention originally *was* for everyone to run a full node, even after adoption increased.  At least, have a full node that runs your hot wallet, even if you have a lightweight client elsewhere that talks to it.  The original idea was actually for regular users to mine coins as well.  Clearly that's changed in the intervening time, and perhaps Satoshi didn't foresee the broadened use cases for it, but still.

There's also a loss of trust when you try to scam someone out of their LN-committed bitcoins.  If someone tries this repeatedly, no one is going to want to open a LN channel with them any more.
Also, if you want to force the other person to pay the fees, it's much easier and simpler to just never commit the transaction.  Then you don't even have to pay the fees in the first place, with the added benefit of not getting a black mark from trying to screw someone else over.

BTC is mined by Chinese miners.  The vocal Wall Street types control speculation, not the protocol.
If China and Wall Street ever made things too difficult for Bitcoin, there is one nuclear option that can be trotted out - proof-of-work change.

If you buy a coffee at Starbucks with fiat, you need the dollars in hand.  That's no different from Bitcoin.
Generally speaking, Bitcoin is only useful for regular consumers in certain conditions.  I consider it to be very useful as internet money, because I don't need to trust anyone else with my cash - you hold the bitcoins in your own digital wallet (as long as you keep it safe) and you specify how much you are sending.
With a credit card, you give the vendor all your payment information and then they take the money they want.  They can always take more money than you thought they were going to, and unless you notice it and raise a fuss, you suddenly have less money than you should.
For Starbucks, frankly, a credit card is probably easier and better.  Cash is even easier, and you don't even have to open yourself up to potential bank account theft.  If you don't like how the government and banks play with your money though, Bitcoin is there waiting for you.  And hopefully, someday, paying with Bitcoin will be just as easy as paying with card or cash.

Nope.  Really what "return to the original wallet" means, is that your wallet will allow you to spend those coins again.

With SegWit's implementation, Lightning is now technically feasible.  It's all up to the wallet makers to implement it - and no, there isn't a date set.  There are a couple wallets that people have made to test it out, and it seems to work, but they're only for the technically-minded.

It's that the app now defaults to BCH while still calling itself "Bitcoin Wallet" instead of "Bitcoin Cash Wallet".  Noobs will see "Bitcoin Wallet" by "Bitcoin.com", have no clue what they're doing, and proceed to do things that are likely to lose them money.
If the wallet was honest about everything, we wouldn't have any problem with it.

It doesn't necessarily have to be on the core wallet.  In fact, the core wallet is probably the -least- applicable place to put it.  Phone wallets are a much better place for it.

Here's the thing - there is no way the Bitcoin block chain can scale to encompass all the transactions it will need to support if it becomes the cryptocurrency of choice for the world at large.  Right now, if you mention Bitcoin to a friend, chances are they have heard of it but never looked into it.  That will change if it really takes off.
I'd say maybe 1 in 100 people really use Bitcoin among people who are fairly computer literate, and even we don't typically use it very often.  If 50 of those 100 people started not only using it, but using it regularly?  Our 1MB blocks would suddenly need to not just double, but increase by two or three orders of magnitude.  100MB-1GB blocks, every 10 minutes.  Roughly 1TB every four days.  That is what we would be looking at if on-chain scaling was the direction we took.  Even if storage weren't an issue, most PCs can't validate 1GB of transactions in less than 10 minutes, let alone the network we would need to support it.
We need off-chain scaling solutions much, much more than we need on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:41:57
That's the nice thing about exercise - if you keep it up, you have more energy.  Then you're not as drained after your shit job, and you can do things you like.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:26:02
Bitcoin *can* scale to encompass all the transactions - as long as we have a single authority that runs it and deals with all the logistical issues with the incredibly beefy hardware and super-fat data pipes that it would require.  But we already have that, and it's called Visa.
We want Bitcoin to be *distributed* though, and most people's connections can't even handle 1GB blocks without incurring ridiculous data overage fees, let alone trying to verify a 1GB block before the next block comes in.  Heck, a sizable portion of the United States is stuck with 8Mbit connections or slower, and you can't even download 1GB in 10 minutes with that.  Essentially, if you can't run a full node on a Raspberry Pi with a 1TB hard drive attached to it and a DSL internet connection, we have failed.
LN looks like it has a very good chance of relieving a lot of the pressure on Bitcoin to support microtransactions.  It's a separate use case that wasn't really possible once high transaction fees became a reality.  It won't solve *all* problems, but it may help - we won't know until it's implemented, but I'm excited to see what possibilities it opens up.  Other similar solutions will likely make things even better as time goes on.  The dev team isn't super fast since it's a coalition of disparate developers, but it's also full of some very smart people.
That said, we won't be able to test huge amounts of LN transactions until it's implemented, and we wouldn't be able to test 1GB blocks either unless it was implemented... but since LN fits the ideals of Bitcoin itself far better than 1GB blocks does, that's the route we're taking at the moment.  We'll see.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:58:52

Correct - but we haven't seen what kind of effect a good lightning implementation will have on the blockchain yet.  I want to see how it shakes out.  (And I want to be able to buy my bitcoin coffees!)
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:04:40
The problem is that the chain will grow faster than storage space is growing, even with 1mb blocks.  The sweet spot, if fees and choked transactions weren't an issue, would be 200K block size... but there's no way you'd get much of anyone on board with that.
The answer isn't going to be increasing block size; it's going to be making easy and reliable ways to make transactions off the blockchain.  Otherwise the answer is going to be eliminating a majority of home users' full nodes.

Bitcoin is not going to be the be-all, end-all cryptocurrency.  Other cryptos will fill the niches that Bitcoin won't be able to.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:22:31
We want to have that problem, yes, but we still want good long-term solutions that won't require gigantic datacenters to run the network.
The off-chain options that are *currently being worked on* only require you to enter into an agreement with other accounts, not centralize.  The off-chain transactions themselves are still trustless and secure, with the extra benefit of not needing to wait for a block to be mined.  It's only marginally more difficult to set up a peer-to-peer mesh network of payment channels (especially with the newest breakthrough in intermediary-layer lightning that only requires one payment channel setup for many accounts) than it is to have a single centralized channel, technologically speaking.
We'll get there.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:02:29
But it also has the potential to require far less hard drive space, doesn't require a hard fork, fixes the transaction malleability bug, and opens up the door for more advancements.  I'd say that's a pretty good tradeoff.
Right now, Segwit adoption is low because there aren't many user-friendly wallets that have implemented it.  That will change soon, and at that point we'll probably see much better transaction fees even when BCH is being annoying.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:45:07
Yes, as time goes on we will need to explore more options for scaling Bitcoin.  SegWit is one of those options which came to fruition, and it will increase the block size as wallet adoption increases.  Further advancements along these lines (along with, possibly, a good old-fashioned blocksize increase) will increase the capacity of the network in just the way you are describing.
The reason 2X was not supported is because of WHO was presenting it, not WHAT it was.  If the core devs presented a sane, well-tested hard fork for larger blocks, there's a much higher likelihood of it being generally accepted because the core devs have a lot of social currency with the users of Bitcoin.  They've proven themselves trustworthy.  The folks behind the NYA have not.
At the moment Bitcoin is still in the early-adopter phase, and it's suffering growing pains - not just software-wise, but community-wise.  It'll get bigger and better as time goes on.  Watch and wait, but don't expect it to be perfect every step of the way.  Right now is one of those times that it isn't perfect, but it's still the best we have.

Ahhh right, I was responding blind to replies.  Was thinking I was responding to a different conversation.
I suppose if you have two computers handy and you're willing to airgap one of them, it's a good plan.  A hardware wallet is cheaper than a 2nd PC if you don't already have a spare though, and significantly easier to sign transactions with.  (And it's more portable.)
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:47:11
Depends on if you're using a credit account or a debit card, but you're correct.  And it's not like accruing debt is actually *better* for you unless your interest rate is lower than inflation, aside from the capability of initiating a chargeback.
Whatever the case, using a payment method online opens you up to risk, whether that's identity theft or money theft or credit card fraud.  With Bitcoin that risk is nonexistent - the only risk you incur is the risk of someone not sending you the thing you bought.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:17:59
The lack of replay protection is what made it worse than the BCH fork.  They didn't want to have two separate coins, they wanted it to take over the chain.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:54:07
Your fees would go to the main chain every time you need to sync your BTC back up.
Lightning is a way to set up a payment channel, but the setup and closing of the channel each need a transaction on the main Bitcoin chain.  Each of those transactions will need miner fees.
If Lightning becomes widespread, it will be much easier for people to deal with micropayments on Bitcoin.  That increases the use cases for Bitcoin, which increases demand, which increases adoption.  That increased adoption is what is going to increase the amount of transaction fees the miners collect.

Thank you.  This is the right answer.
To translate for OP:
Segwit adds overhead data to blocks, meaning slightly fewer transactions can be collected by miners - and hence slightly less transaction fees claimed.  Some of this data is to make the blocks backwards-compatible; if segwit were guaranteed going forward, the block size difference would be next to nothing.
If it is decided that segwit is a bad idea after it has been implemented, and must be rolled back, BTC that was spent through segwit can be claimed by anyone who was involved in the transactions once it is rolled back, provided they were not yet spent by the new owner.  This may permit the spending of bitcoins by someone who ostensibly spent them already according to segwit rules.
It's remotely possible that there is a bug that no one caught in the segwit code, since it IS new functionality being added to Bitcoin.  Sort of like how AsicBoost is a flaw only recently discovered in the standard Bitcoin protocol implementation.
Implementing segwit in all Bitcoin nodes and clients can be difficult, as there is some complexity to how it works.
Miners that do not use segwit-capable clients will not include segwit transactions in blocks, as they appear to break some of the rules that have been added on top of the base Bitcoin protocol.  They will still accept blocks hashed by other miners that DO accept segwit, but non-segwit miners won't include segwit transactions in their *own* mined blocks.  This can decrease the number of transactions included by those miners - and hence, decrease the transaction fees gained by them - until they upgrade their clients.  (This is different from Bitcoin Unlimited, which would cause a hard fork if it were ever implemented - blocks mined by BU clients will be rejected entirely by non-BU clients.)
AsicBoost depends on block manipulation that is not compatible with segwit.  Most people agree that AsicBoost is cheating, though.

Paypal is generally difficult to get bitcoins with unless you know someone who's willing to sell you a few BTC.  There's a lot of trust issues involved.  If you have Second Life you can go through VirWox by buying some Linden$ first, and then buying BTC with the L$ - but the fees involved mean you'll lose at least 8% on the transactions involved as well as winding up with L$ left over since they refuse to deal in anything less than whole dollars and whole BTC.

There is an article floating around about tactics used by gold farmers (multiple sessions on multiple computers, with some necessary user interaction) here:
And there's an article about prison labor (which is effectively free for whoever runs the prison) being used to farm gold here:
Most of the information I can find says that the grunts manning the computers are paid pennies.  The white paper claims that the typical salary is about $145/month.

There will always be enthusiasts, if not miners, that keep the entire blockchain for people to authenticate against.  Their incentive is to provide a benefit to the Bitcoin community.  Some companies may find a more tangible benefit to holding the entire unpruned blockchain.
When I need to get a new node up to speed, I'll usually torrent a copy of a fairly recent Core blockchain database to drastically reduce my sync time.
In the future, there will likely be 'pre-pruned' chains you can download that are drastically smaller.  You'll need to make sure that you trust the source of the chain, but it would also make spinning up a new node much easier.

If you're using the standard bitcoin client it's just one of the menu options. Just make sure the passphrase is something you will DEFINITELY REMEMBER, because if you forget, those bitcoins are no longer usable. At all.
As for encrypting transactions... No. The bitcoin network is built off of transparency. If no one can see where your coins were spent, then there is no consensus that those coins were spent at all.

Honestly, swings don't really matter.  If you believe Bitcoin will actually pull off a money revolution, it's worth holding and worth using.  If it won't be magic future currency, it's not worth anything.
I like Bitcoin and what it represents.  I hold some and use it.  Other people don't like Bitcoin and don't care about what it represents, and they don't hold or use it.  Simple as that.  The price swings are pretty much immaterial, except where it makes it easier to acquire BTC or makes it more useful to buy things with it.

1. Acquire bitcoin, place in wallet
1. Wait for something you want to buy with bitcoin
1. Buy thing with bitcoin
1. Immediately restock your bitcoin
Voila!  My exposure to volatility is almost nil, I was able to buy something from a vendor without having to expose my bank account information to a third party, and I made bitcoin more valuable by actually using it.  The only entity I had to trust money-wise was the exchange where I buy my bitcoin.

One of the major ideas of Bitcoin, though, is that the monetary incentives drive miners towards actions that are the most beneficial to the network.  Right now, that's not entirely the case as evidenced by Antpool's behavior.  SegWit will fix that, eventually, as monetary incentives for "good" behavior outweigh the gains of using ASICboost, but for now it makes the most fiscal sense to just confirm the empty blocks.  They're annoying, but they aren't harmful enough to be worth excluding.

There is no 'absolute' speed.  A frame of reference is required to measure distance, speed, etc.  Due to the messed up rules of high-speed travel, although it can appear as though two objects are travelling away from each other at up to nearly 2 times the speed of light, from the point of view of either of those objects, they will only be travelling at almost the speed of light away from each other.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:08:59
Bitcoin HAS done it, already.  SegWit drastically increases the potential number of transactions.  As adoption increases, we will see more and more 1MB+ blocks mined, and we'll see the size grow until we're seeing near-100% SegWit transactions.  Why don't we see how well SegWit works before forcing a conentious hard-fork on everyone?

Dodging taxes isn't the reason to use Bitcoin; the taxman will always come for you.

If you aren't a programmer, then don't make assumptions about the complexity of code.  SegWit itself is actually not that complex; all it does is move signatures to a second data section.  There is very little else to it.  Plus, the core devs are pretty good about writing clean, comprehensive code, so where you get the idea that it incurs technical debt is beyond me.
Technical debt is incurred primarily by hackish, poorly coded, or outdated programs, not comprehensive new features.
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:48:26


....that's one reason SegWit is important.  Code is law, and so now the code is there to enforce good behavior.  Eventually it will be more economical to mine SegWit blocks than to make use of the ASICboost exploit.

You're completely missing one of the major reasons I like paying with Bitcoin:
You don't have to open up a tap to your banking account just to buy something.  You can send a discrete, defined amount by yourself without having to rely on someone else to hold your money for you.  The peace-of-mind from having direct control of your funds is worth it, in my opinion.  No PayPal potentially freezing your account, no credit card transaction that can get skimmed and open up your entire account to getting drained dry.

You should look up what fractional reserve banking is yourself if that's what you think it is.
Banks don't create money - they loan out money that is deposited in savings accounts, keeping a *fraction* of it in *reserve* for when people need to withdraw the money that ostensibly belongs to them.
This is why runs on banks are so devastating.  Since you're a little light on banking parlance, I'll fill you in on what a "run on a bank" means - it's when people lose faith in the bank, and try to withdraw all their money from it.  Since the bank has loaned out a bunch of that money, they don't have it available to the people who are withdrawing it - which means they have to shut their doors and restrict withdrawals.
Depositing money in a bank is rather like keeping your Bitcoins in an exchange - the money doesn't really belong to you until you withdraw it.  In the meantime, the bank is using that money to get more money in the form of interest on loans.  If there's a run on the bank, there's a chance you won't be able to withdraw it because *they don't have it*.  They can't just print more to hand to you.

2Xcoins will be useless if no one wants to buy them, no matter how miners insist they are the sole source of value to the blockchain.  If/when it is made clear that users don't want 2Xcoin, and all the value is on the core chain, miners will flee it in droves.
The lack of replay protection is what will kill either the 2Xcoin or the core-coin.  Transactions will wind up on both networks, so the coins can't be disentangled from the two chains, but some coins will simply fail to be spent on the other chain as miners try to pass their newly minted 2Xcoins off as valid.

Demand for Bitcoin is outstripping supply, and will likely continue to do so.

Well, the reason -I- like the idea of purchasing with Bitcoin is because of the fine control over your own BTC you have - as compared to credit cards, PayPal, or any other similar services, where you are allowing the service provider to control a tap into your entire bank account.  I don't really trust PayPal at the best of times, but it's by far the easiest way to make purchases online.  Bitcoin (and the various services that will eventually come from Bitcoin) will hopefully supplant that, without requiring you to leave your whole account balance at the mercy of others.

People think of money they have in a bank as "theirs" - it's actually MORE liquid now when it's in a bank than when they have cash in hand, which is the opposite of how it used to be.  THAT'S why there hasn't been a run on a bank in decades.
Banks need to keep their books balanced or they face the wrath of auditors and huge, huge legal issues.  They can only loan out money they already have.  For each dollar spent on something that isn't paid with a credit card (which is paying with an IOU, not a real 'purchase'), there's a dollar bill *somewhere* that is actually changing ownership, even if it's only from one bank to another.
You ask where the money loaned out comes from.  It comes from the deposited money, which is put into a big slush pile.  It's not magic.  (I'm not sure what you mean by "between the deposit".  If someone tries to withdraw money that the bank doesn't have because it's loaned out, they just don't get their money.)

You're missing the facts entirely here.
Decreased mortality rate in developing countries (say, from vaccines and improved healthcare) has the paradoxical result of reducing population growth.  Parents are able to invest more in a small number of children who are more likely to survive instead of having large families in the hopes that some of them survive.
Reproductive services does not mean abortions necessarily; it means birth control, which reduces unwanted pregnancies and tends to increase the age at which parents have children.  Which reduces population growth.

Shift is essentially acting as an exchange here, so there's only a fee if Shift decides it is necessary.  You transfer your BTC to Shift's wallet and they buy the coins from you when you make a card purchase, deducting the BTC from your account.

Fees are based off of the amount of data in the non-witness portion of the block.  The witness data doesn't count towards the cost of the transaction.  Since this makes the pay-portion of the transaction smaller, the transaction costs less to transmit.

You will have BTC and BCH.
BTCg has no replay protections, so any BTC you spend will also spend your BTCg (unless they fix that particular problem between now and October 25th.  Personally I find it more likely that BTCg will just die on the vine), and vice-versa.  DON'T send your BTCg anywhere until there's a reliable way to make sure you are ONLY sending BTCg.
In that sense, I feel that BTCg isn't a separate coin - it's a separate protocol that will result in a scrambled chain until it's matured.

You are taking something without giving anything in return, and after signing a contract agreeing to return it (plus interest).  How that isn't theft is beyond me.  If I create a piece of art and loan it to you for a week, then you run off with it and never return it, that's theft - it doesn't matter whether or not I created the piece of art from nothing.

Nono, the post is outlining a deficiency in how it is that SPV wallets work, not a statement of policy.  Because B2X refuses to differentiate itself meaningfully from Bitcoin, the method SPV wallets use to check for the highest proof-of-work can be fooled into seeing the B2X chain as the correct chain to build off of.  Bread is recognizing it as a flaw and warning users about it, since fixing it would require overhauling the entire structure of how Breadwallet checks blocks.

The lack of profit motives are the EXACT reason for the government to provide certain services.  Costs are not necessarily driven to a bare minimum by competition, especially in situations where marketplace entry is difficult (in which situation market forces will often cause consolidation, not innovation).
There are also situations where market forces actively oppose the entire purpose of a service.  Take a look at what's happening with binding arbitration.  A company goes with a particular arbitration service, not only because it costs less than the public court system, but also because the arbitration service finds overwhelmingly in favor of the company.  Arbitration services that do not weigh in favor of the company find themselves with no customers.  Hence, market forces dictate that a free-market arbitration service should find in favor of the company, because the company can afford to pay the arbitration service and the individual cannot - and justice is not served.  The public courts would certainly be preferred by the individual, but as they have no negotiation leverage - every single company out there now includes a binding arbitration clause in every single contract they are legally allowed to do so in - the individual is left in the lurch.  By the invisible hand of the market that should, ostensibly, work in the favor of the customer.
In order for the free market to actually work, you need a minimum number of "good actors" in positions of power, who are actively interested in providing services that benefit the people who they ostensibly serve - and you need each and every customer to have a perfect knowledge of who the good actors are.  Without that, a free market simply means giving those who would abuse positions of power all the leverage they need and none of the fetters that would keep them in check.

The thing that makes it Bitcoin is the consensus of the people who run and support the Bitcoin network.  Bitcoin Cash was a fork, it was stated as such, and it was built in such a way as to allow it AND Bitcoin to exist at the same time.  Previous Bitcoin hardforks were done with the consensus of the people who run and support the network - thus it was still Bitcoin.

The point of Bitcoins isn't anonymity, it's autonomy.  Bitcoin transactions are all made in the clear anyways; the moment you make a purchase that needs sent to a physical address, any BTC that are held in the same wallet are now known.

Tell that to water utilities.  If one private company owned all the pipes in an area, the cost to build out and bury more would be so prohibitive as to be virtually impossible - especially for a very dubious possibility of recouping the losses, as there is no guaranteed consumer base.  Yes, some barriers are artificial, you are absolutely right about that, but others are very much not.


And if every product in a particular class of product on OpenBazaar came with mandatory arbitration clauses, we'd be exactly where we started.  Right now OpenBazaar is a tiny, tiny niche of like-minded people who buy into the Bitcoin ideal.  If it became a major marketplace, only the tiniest of botique service providers would offer a contract that was beneficial to the consumer, and for a markedly higher price because it would be a feature.
And let's not forget, part of the problem is that money is power.  The more money one has, the more leverage one also has against competitors, whether it is by outlasting them in a price war or buying out their supply chain or any of a myriad of other dirty tricks that *government regulation* exists in part to prevent.

Any time you privatize a social product, you will divide the populace into the "haves" and the "have-nots" as people who cannot afford the service are pushed out of it.  If a democracy is partly dependent upon the general voting populace being educated, healthy, et cetera, privatizing the critical functions of hospitals, schools, and the like cannot be done - at least not without such crippling restrictions on their behavior that it becomes unprofitable.
In other words, privatizing social services shifts too much of the cost burden onto those who both need them the most and can least afford them.

I've purchased bitcoins through several methods, actually, including a cash-&gt;BTC ATM.  And doing some mining.
My user experience so far has been pretty solid, but then, I use Mycelium for most of my regular BTC purchases.  I've had to hold off due to the precipitous climb of transaction fees, but I expect it will settle down in the near future, especially if/when the BTC world finally comes to an agreement on how to move forward and the sucky wallets get sussed out.
The thing about using BTC to shop online is that I only have to trust the person I'm buying from to ship me the one thing I bought, instead of trusting them to not steal all my payment information and go on a buying spree with my cash.  I have to trust the exchange to not steal my money, true, but generally speaking a large exchange is going to be better in that regard than someone who hand-assembles electronics and sells them over the internet.  Normally PayPal would fit this category too, but that ignores the fact that I *utterly loathe* PayPal.

Okay, so the place you and I disagree on is what constitutes the core "block" on the blockchain - I can accept that.

This works in your little microcosm of OpenBazaar because of how you set the system up.  In the real world there is no requirement to be nearly as open about arbitration clauses, and no market pressure to select an arbitrator who is proven fair - in fact, the incentive to select an arbitrator who is unfair is drastically greater than the pressure to select a fair one.
If OpenBazaar becomes the major marketplace to sell goods that come with a contract, then perhaps we'll see that change.

That is insane.  What do you do if a transaction gets orphaned due to the fee being too low?  If all non-duplicate transactions are valid and considered canonical, then BCC will be extraordinarily vulnerable to dust attacks.  Replace-by-fee is a solution to an actual problem; throwing it out the window is *not* the appropriate route to take.
This also depends on miners playing nice, which is by no means guaranteed.  If they can get more BTC by including the transaction with a higher fee and ignoring the earlier one, why *wouldn't* they replace?
The proper technical design is also eliminating the possibility of exploits like ASICboost, and he sure seems to be ignoring *that* part.

Might be related to UASF and SegWit; might be speculation.  The cycle is:
1. Slow climb
2. Speculative bubble
3. All-time highs
4. Crash
5. Slow drop to a new 'normal'
The crazy thing is that every time this happens, the new 'normal' is higher than the peak of the previous bubble.  The last bubble peaked at $1200; even when this bubble pops, the price will probably never get below $1200 again.  Meanwhile, there's no telling when the bubble will pop, but it's sure fun to watch.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:06:58
SegWit = SEGregated (as in not in the same place) WITness (the transaction signatures).  It's only including the absolutely necessary information in what is considered part of the "block", which remains at 1MB.  That means non-SegWit clients will see a block that has no witness data, and will still verify it as a valid block.  The witness data can be requested by a SegWit-capable client but *it is no longer part of the mined block*.
That's why it's a soft fork instead of a hard fork - old clients can still see and verify SegWit blocks, just not with the extra SegWit data that will be visible to SegWit clients.  This would not be possible if the block were larger than 1MB, since ALL clients currently discard blocks larger than 1MB as a rule.

If you are buying bitcoins in multiple batches, each time you shuffle your coins out, you'll pay a transaction fee.  If you wait until you're done, you'll only have to pay for one transaction instead of several.
EDIT:  I should mention that some exchanges actually have a wallet that belongs to you and that your BTC purchases go into; in those instances, there is no difference.  Other exchanges have giant 'slush' wallets and just keep track of how many BTC belong to which customers.  Those are the ones where you will see reduced transaction fees if you don't transfer out of the exchange.

It's part of the Bitcoin protocol - if you want to guarantee that the transaction gets on the blockchain, you include a transaction fee to incentivize the miners to put it in the block.

If you keep your coins on an exchange, it makes it much faster to buy and sell to try to catch the highs and lows.
It also prevents you from having to pay a transaction fee every time you buy.  Instead, when you *do* decide to cash out of an exchange, you can transfer all your BTC into one transaction.
On the downside, you run the risk of losing everything if the exchange goes down or someone gets a hold of your login.

ASICboost goes against the principle of Bitcoin because it encourages non-optimal mining and denying protocol improvements.
Keep in mind:  SegWit was proposed near the end of 2015.  and the whitepaper for ASICboost was published in March of 2016.  ASICboost depends on transaction malleability, which is widely accepted to be a *flaw* in the protocol.
So, ASICboost was written to exploit a bug that there was already a proposed fix for.  This meant there was incentive for all miners who wanted to use ASICboost to shut down any attempts to fix the bug (SegWit).
ASICboost also works easiest with a certain number of transactions (255 or 256 is what I heard), which means mining blocks that aren't full, which means more transactions stuck in the mempool, higher fees, longer confirmation times, and just overall not-goodness.
Plus, there's the patent thing.
ASICboost is bad for Bitcoin.

Antbleed was intentionally coded into the miners.  All it would take to exploit it is a DNS attack, which is far more possible than you seem to think.  If it even *tried* to use a secure communications channel (even a bog-standard SSL cert would be enough), it wouldn't have been an issue.
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:47:00
You're better off finding a recent torrent of the blockchain database rather than getting it off of the Bitcoin network.  It takes MUCH less time.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:51:27


I don't think you have looked into either of these enough.
AntBleed is very, very real and puts roughly 70% of hashpower at risk of sudden shutdown.  Imagine what that would do to market confidence if that happened.
ASICboost is a real exploit, and it means there is an incentive to block SegWit.
NYA starts with SegWit, so anyone who wants SegWit benefits from consensus.  Come November, I suspect there will be a bitter fight between the 2x chain and the core chain; we'll see what happens then.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:09:40
First off, the rising transaction fees as blocks became full would entice miners to take the gamble that Bitcoin is the survivor instead of 2Xcoin (and I suspect that more than 14% of miners would actually be mining Bitcoin at that point anyways, but that's speculation).
Second, unless the changeover happened right after a difficulty check, it would take less than 2016 blocks to make a partial adjustment, which would then result in less time for the next 2016 blocks to be mined.
Third, even in the worst-case scenario of the exact wrong timing and only 14% of hashrate, 100 days later (approximately) the difficulty would adjust and we'd be getting 10-minute blocks again.  They would be a painful 100 days admittedly.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:48:39
Actual chainsplits aren't going to happen until the 2x part of Segwit2x activates, which is further down the road.  August 1st is a non-entity, risk-wise.
That said, buying before August 1st is a good idea, in case Segwit inspires more confidence in the protocol.

If the only way they have to pay people is by using the money that is given to them by other suckers, then it's a pyramid scheme.  If BTC climbs in price within the next year to be more than $4380 then you're paying them for the privilege of sucking the profits out of your investment; if not, then someone is going to be left holding the bag and it might be you.  That $300 referral bonus is very, very suspicious.  Stay far away from this.
Just buy the coin outright from somewhere that isn't trying to leech your money.
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:51:17
I was sorely tempted to go for some of those - until I found a proper mining profitability calculator that took into account increasing difficulty.  I realized I'd probably never actually get a return on my investment and just bought some more BTC instead.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:40:29
Then what do you call artificially increasing demand?
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:58:49
Any business that wants to sell goods or services for bitcoin wants transactions to be as painless as possible.  That means low fees, which means *some* form of widely accepted scaling.  Whether it's on-chain or off-chain, it doesn't matter - but on-chain is more likely to have mass acceptance.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:50:03
They are still valid.  Segwit is a soft fork, so even after Segwit activates, all coins mined through it will be legit no matter what happens.  The only difficulty will be getting your transactions on a block if you are behind the times.

It's not the downloading that takes so much time - the CPU is the bottleneck either way.  It's the database overhead *plus* the verification.

The other payment methods typically still require me to give someone else a tap into my bank account (or, fine, credit account if we're using a credit card).

Remember, though, that you should NEVER have more money in Bitcoin than you are willing to lose.  If the amount you are willing to lose is less than your current Bitcoin holdings, sell until you're willing to lose what you have left again.

The point of mining is doing computational work.  With ASICboost, they're essentially reusing the same hash and getting a different value out of it.  If their new result is below the target, then voila, they 'mined' a block - but did so by mining a block with a lot of different hash results for the same cost as doing a single hash (or minimally more than a single hash).  So they're achieving results without doing the work.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:49:43

You're still giving an out-and-out lie.  You have no proof.  If you give the *facts*, do you think people wouldn't believe you?

As the size of a block increases linearly, the difficulty of mining it increases quadratically.  That is NOT a low-risk option.  Removing the limit means murdering the hashrate, let alone the increase in storage space it would require.
SegWit effectively IS a blocksize increase, as well as a heap of improved functionality, and it comes with the side-benefit of not requiring a hard fork.  Old clients will work just fine, they just won't be able to see the sigs until they upgrade.

MtGox is not the entirety of Bitcoin.  It makes sense to try and ask MtGox to do some regulation, when what has been happening is to the significant detriment of most of their customers.  At some point, they'll get things squared away, but in the meantime, they need to do some damage control.
In that sense, it's the perfect example of Bitcoin.  MtGox is its own market; they can do what they want.  It's in their benefit to keep Bitcoins from crashing hard, since if that happens, their long-term volume is going to go way down.
You can always use your bitcoins elsewhere, no one is keeping you from transferring them to your own wallet and spending them on whatever you want to.  In that sense, bitcoins themselves will never be regulated; no one can prevent you from doing what you want with them unless *you yourself give them the power to do so*.

No.  People's credit cards were not stolen.  People's credit card *information* was stolen.
It is easier to steal someone's credit card.  You never know what method someone is using to store their private keys.  To steal their card?  Just snatch their wallet.  Stealing their credit card *information* is even easier.  Any number of man-in-the-middle attacks, whether it be bribing a waiter, putting a skimmer on an ATM, or using a keylogger on a debit card reader, will get you everything you need to go on a shopping spree.
EVERY TIME YOU USE YOUR CREDIT CARD YOU ARE AT RISK OF HAVING THE INFORMATION STOLEN, completely unknown to you.
No form of skimmer will get you someone's bitcoins, since only publically-signed transactions are needed to spend them.  You have to get the wallet itself, and if someone is even halfway serious about it, the wallet will be encrypted, and backups kept in a secure place (and also encrypted).
And sure, a single phone call will keep you from getting shafted, but that just means the merchants who unwittingly sold to someone using stolen information get shafted.  Shifting the risk is not an answer, especially if you ever want to sell something to another person.

There is huge interest in the bitcoin community for mining equipment, amounting to millions of dollars of demand.  Supply will have to grow a lot for any extremely wealthy entity to get a majority.  Additionally, it isn't in a business's interest to try to kill Bitcoin, since there's no real way to short it.

You're already using the internet by virtue of the fact that you're using Bitcoins.  It's trivial to look up a seller on resellerratings.com if the store has any significant amount of traffic.  Whenever I find a good deal through an online store I'm not familiar with, I check there first.
Plus, it's not like using Bitcoins totally exempts a company from consumer protection laws.  You can still report them to the BBB, for example.
And lastly, there's nothing keeping sellers from cheating you without Bitcoin.  Inferior Chinese bootleg products exist, almost indistinguishable from the real thing.  Misleading pricing on services is practically the norm.  Investments marketed as a sure thing have gone down the tubes in the recent past.  Credit cards didn't exactly help with those, did they?

This already happens, regularly.  Look at Target's recent credit card fiasco.
The trouble is that Bitcoin is still vulnerable to attacks anywhere that a lot of people keep their BTC.  Until people start keeping their wallets safe, and under their own control, or until people come up with better methods for making sure that bitcoins aren't stolen out from under their noses while running services, people will continue to consider Bitcoin just as dangerous as credit cards - if not moreso, since the customer can usually just demand a chargeback when using a CC.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:18:57

How many times has my private key been stolen?
OH LOOK IT HASN'T.
Even if someone did steal my wallet?  The key is encrypted.  If someone stole my backup?  Also encrypted.  And it's not like using your bitcoins puts you at risk of having them stolen.  You don't need to give anyone your private key to spend them.
Conversely, *every time you use your credit card, you are giving someone all the information they need to steal it.*
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:06:54
The simple, straight, factual answer is this:
The reason the exchange rate is going up is because people are willing to buy them at higher prices.
Really, that's the long and the short of it.  There is no 'real' basis for the climb in price.  It is entirely subjective since even the amount of work required to mine the bitcoins is variable.  If people think bitcoins are worth $100 each, they will buy them at what they see as a 'fantastic deal' up until the price reaches $100/BTC.

On-chain transactions will continue to be accessible to the general public though.

Internet = you can easily look up the reputation of a seller.  *Don't trust someone you can't research.*  It's the equivalent of buying audio equipment someone has in the back of their van.


The BBB is a good stick for people who want to appear to be a legitimate business.  It's not perfect, as you point out, but it *is* one of the forms of consumer protection.  My point is that the law is still the law, whether you're using CC or BTC.


Was your credit card information stolen, and then used to buy things?  Thieves can't do that nearly so easily with BTC, and thus, the need for chargebacks is significantly reduced.  With CC it's ridiculously easy - pose as a legitimate vendor, ask for CC info, and then use it to buy whatever you want.  With BTC they have to get a hold of your private key somehow.

Most reasonable money transfer options that don't require you to pay annoyingly high fees (such as wiring money) have about a one-week waiting period and require you to submit a scan of your government ID.

Either by 1) selling the BTC to someone else for cash, or 2) finding someone who would sell him gas for BTC.  In other words, the same way you would use anything that isn't federally mandated to be legal tender.

Especially on a QR code.  Depending on the error correction level, you could obscure up to 30% of the QR code and still have it readable.

It might be against the rules of whatever company you're getting the money transferred to you through, but as far as Gox/Dwolla/etc is concerned, you can do whatever you want with your bitcoins.

Sell *X* + *n* ASIC machines, because profitability isn't necessarily the only driving factor.

If you're willing to deal with actual people, and have a more secure method of money transfer on hand than Paypal (or, perhaps, are willing to buy some Amazon gift codes to sell), you can always hit up the good folks over at the Bitcoin-OTC IRC channel.  You'll need to learn a little syntax to work their bot, but I've made a couple transactions there without any issues.  Just make sure to check people's ratings.
