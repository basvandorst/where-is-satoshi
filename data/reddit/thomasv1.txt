Please stop the FUD. Electrum is compatible with older versions of itself. What the OP described was a temporary bug in git head. 
There is a reason why we do not use BIP39 seeds; we do this to protect users. You should stay away from BIP39 wallets. Among other issues, BIP39 seed phrases lacks a version number. Without a version number, there is no way to know which address derivation method should be used. It is not a problem today, because they all use BIP44. However, when wallets start to use to new derivation methods (such as SegWit, or Schnorr signatures), there will be a problem. BIP39 does not address the issues of future compatibility.

@_date: 2016-08-29 05:14:43
yes it is.
@_date: 2016-08-26 06:25:55
You can set dynamic fees in your preferences, if you want to use fee values recommended by the network. We are going to release Electrum 2.7 very soon, and dynamic fees will be enabled by default.
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:05:36
Multisig, or hardware wallets, are meant to protect against this. Electrum supports both.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:20:39
Stop spreading FUD. Electrum does support hardware wallets (trezor, ledger, keepkey). It is more secure to use your hardware wallet with a real Bitcoin wallet, such as Electrum, than with a simple website, such as mytrezor.com, because the website must be trusted on the existence of transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:31:37
Please learn how Bitcoin works. Electrum and Breadwallet are SPV wallets; this means that they download blockchain headers and verify wallet transactions. In contrast, Copay, Mycelium are non-SPV; they trust a central server to send them correct data. If that server is hacked, the attacker can abuse users.
@_date: 2016-08-26 06:20:54
Mycelium requests your balance and transactions from a  central closed source server, and your wallet app has to trust that server. In contrast, Breadwallet is a SPV wallet. SPV wallets download block headers from the Bitcoin network, and verify that all the transactions they receive are in the Blockchain, by checking merkle branches and difficulty. So the trust model is very different.
You can have both speed and security with Electrum. Electrum is a SPV wallet that can sync very fast, because it does not scan the blockchain. Instead, it requests your wallet history from a subset of the Bitcoin network, that indexes all transactions by address.
@_date: 2016-08-29 04:57:21
Old Electrum seeds are still supported in Electrum, and will ever be. The OP was running from git head and encountered a few bugs, that are being fixed.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:04:32
Thank you, Theymos, for the announcement and explanations.
Note for users who are not familiar with GitHub: You should upgrade your client right now, even if the GitHub issue has not been closed yet.  The vulnerability affects all users, and not just people using an Electrum daemon on a web server, as reported initially in the github issue.
The 3.0.4 release addresses the vulnerability for GUI users. The GitHub issue will remain open until we add password protection to the jsonrpc interface, as initially suggested by jsmad. Password protection is needed for merchants/websites who need to use an Electrum daemon from a remote machine. In the meantime, merchants should use jsonrpc on the same machine only.
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:02:36
thanks! Note: if you start the daemon with -P, you'll need to do 'electrum daemon status -P' as well, because it refers to the portable directory. (you can run several daemons on the same machine, if they use different directories)
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:18:02
indeed, see 
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:21:25
electrum dev here. Not sure about your daemon issue. For multisig, you have to enter a json array:
./electrum  createmultisig 2 "[\"03bc7d426c6f27900898a458c46d5bc976946dc780e6f522d39854ae6e57e912ab\",\"035f1569989439c0e6d1b6fb7748e5ce8af806a7a6640c50d72a76d81559356c7d\",\"03c2842371d32b8f1d125ef43b947a86481a0fcc391752149b8c62dd8d4498f6be\"]"

clarification: BIP32 is already finalized, but it lacks a description of the wallet structure. That structure is currently being standardised.
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:11:23
I am the main developer of Electrum. The original post contains statements that are not true. Electrum does indeed connect to a single server in order to fetch transactions and address histories. However, it also connects to MANY servers in order to fetch block headers, find and verify the longest chain, and verify that all the transactions in its history are consistent with the blockchain, using SPV. 
SPV is a way to check that all transactions received by the client are in the blockchain. However, SPV is not a proof of completeness: the client has no proof that it received all the transactions that are relevant to its wallet (the nodes you are talking to could be lying by omission). Electrum currently does not have a way to verify completeness of its history (although this will be addressed soon). Note that clients using bloom filters (Multibit) have exactly the same weakness: they can verify the transactions they receive (using spv), but they lack a proof of completeness too.
One security advantage of Electrumis that servers are authenticated using SSL; this provides protection against MITM attacks, which is a problem for thin clients, including bloom filter clients. However, this advantage comes at the cost of privacy, because the main Electrum server you use knowns which addresses you are using; bloom filter clients have more privacy (although I believe the default setting in Multibit is to favor speed at the expense of privacy).
@_date: 2014-05-20 10:13:12
Short answer: for SPV. The Electrum client connects to about 8 servers in order to retrieve block headers, which are needed for Simple Payment Verification.
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:57:55
Certificates are pinned because they are self-signed. However, Electrum 2.0 will support certificates signed by a CA. This feature is already implemented in github.
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:34:58
I am the main developer of Electrum. I am working on a multisig electrum plugin (and I posted about it on bitcointalk). However, this cannot be released before BIP32 is finalized.
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:54:49
No, (2) is wrong: other servers are only used to fetch block headers, and not to get Merkle branches. It is not necessary to fetch Merkle branches from several sources in SPV, it does not make SPV better, and it would actually decrease your privacy. The nodes that are used to fetch block headers are selected at random, and the GUI does not let you choose them. The GUI only lets you choose the main server, because that server is privacy relevant. 
Fetching history from several nodes could indeed reduce the risk of a server lying by omission. However, I believe it is much better to implement proofs of completeness, because methods based on cross-checking multiple answers will never be really safe. (that's why Bitcoin does not use byzantine agreement)
Concerning proofs of completeness, these ideas have been discussed at length in the bitcoin forum (I will let you do your research) and there is even a draft BIP here:  In addition, a MIT student is about to publish an academic paper on a new method suitable for Electrum, at CCS2014. The paper title is " VerSum: Verifiable Computations over Large Public Logs". I cannot disclose his paper now, because it is still unpublished, but it will be published soon. I plan to implement this method, combined with SPV.
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:30:06
Electrum is not affected by that, it's a bug in the bitcore library used by Copay.
Even if you can use BIP39 seeds in Electrum, we do not recommend to do so. It is safer to create an Electrum seed. For an explanation, see 
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:59:16
Electrum is not affected. Please update thread title.
@_date: 2017-02-23 06:48:11
The bug is with Copay, not Electrum
@_date: 2015-05-02 07:17:25
see 
@_date: 2016-03-02 10:13:56
Did that site give you a Bitcoin address, or a a signed payment request? If the request is signed, then you have a proof that you send your Bitcoin to them.
@_date: 2016-03-05 04:55:10
address generation taking forever: was it a watching-only wallet? if yes, it should be fixed now.
seed words: weird, I cannot reproduce that
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:14:00
ok, from what you write I believe it did create the same wallet, because the history was not empty. It failed at fully synchronizing it, for some reason. Note that the Android version only displays the last 10 transactions, not the full history; I should fix that or clarify it.
I noticed the following bug: if you have several wallets, when you open a new one, it does not immediately refresh the receive address. Could that be your issue? I will fix that ASAP.
EDIT: issue fixed
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:13:15
Development has not stopped, and 2.0 should be out within a month. Things have been delayed a bit, in part because of my email/twitter account hack.

you can choose between a fixed fee per kb, and a dynamic fee
@_date: 2016-03-05 09:36:33
yes, but you will need to change its password to a 6 numbers PIN, before you copy it to the phone
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:55:10
The watching-only issue was fixed in 2.6.1.2.
I just pushed 2.6.1.3, that fixes the receive tab refreshing
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:56:32
thanks!!! thanks for your feedback too, fixing bugs relies on that.
@_date: 2016-03-08 10:39:59
if you see the transaction, it means that the server you are using did not reject it, probably because it is running an old version of bitcoind. just use a different server.
@_date: 2016-03-05 04:52:16
Developer here. Multisig wallet creation is not supported in the current android GUI. However, it should work if you copy a multisig wallet from your desktop to your android phone.
@_date: 2016-03-05 04:56:13

you cannot; I will add delete and rename soon.
note that on startup the app opens the last open wallet.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:33:19
wallets have been moved to internal storage, in order to increase security; see 
you cannot copy them anymore, unless you're on a rooted phone.
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:41:31
Note 2: In addition to privacy, one of the reasons why file encryption was added is to prevent users from requesting Bitcoins using an address they do not control (because they forgot the password, or because they did not create the wallet that is on their computer). 
@_date: 2016-03-12 11:00:30
did you "recover" with your seed phrase, or did you enter a bitcoin address instead? in the latter case, it would create a watching-only wallet with the bug you describe. If you still have that wallet we can find out. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:20:28
you cannot encrypt hardware wallets for the moment, it only works for wallets that use a password. if you want to encrypt an existing wallet, open the 'update password' dialog, enter your password and tick the box.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:17:29
To be complete, let me add that I believe a compromise will be necessary between core developers and miners. I don't think the current situation can be unlocked by a binary choice between BU and Segwit.
@_date: 2016-03-24 09:06:49
If you used Coinbase, then you should have received a BIP70 signed payment request. This signed request is proof that the payment was requested by Coinbase. It should be archived by your wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:16:38
This is citing me out of context. The entire statement is "I, Thomas Voegtlin, support Segregated Witness as a scaling solution for Bitcoin, and I am opposed to a hard fork initiated by miners running Bitcoin Unlimited. However, I also believe that Electrum users should be free to choose between Bitcoin Core and BU, and that I should not abuse my position in order to favor one party. I have tried to keep this documentation as neutral as possible."

@_date: 2019-02-18 06:58:40
The issue has been fixed in Electrum. The goal of this sticky post is to have users upgrade their software. The post title is not very well chosen in that regard, it would have been more productive to display "Electrum versions older than 3.3.2 are vulnerable to phishing, please upgrade"

yes it has been fixed in Electrum, but users need to upgrade. See my other comments below.
@_date: 2019-02-03 13:34:58
PSA: Legit Electrum servers have started deploying a "good attack" on users who have not upgraded their software. This means they will see a message warning them about the vulnerability, and directing them to electrum.org.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:36:07
Full of contradictions, but not necessarily fake: users do not always report the full relevant information, and they do not always understand the implications of their actions. In this case I believe the user might have exported private keys from his Electrum wallet, in order to save them separately in a .zip file. This would have opened his wallet to various attacks.
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:46:09
This means that a wallet was already installed on your computer, before you installed Electrum. This could be unintentional or malicious (they try to have you request coins at an address you do not control). If you do not have the password to this wallet, do not request coins with it.
@_date: 2017-04-20 07:42:06
the next version of electrum for android will let you connect to a private server. the feature is in the development version.
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:56:06
No, that is not accurate. By default Electrum will choose a server with the longest blockchain. If there is a fork in the blockchain, it will use a server that is on the longest side of the fork. Since Segwit is a soft fork, the only situation where there can be two competing chains is if the Segwit branch has less proof-of-work than the non-forking chain. In that case, the default behaviour of Electrum is to pick the non-forking chain.
@_date: 2016-02-09 17:58:23
see instructions here: 
@_date: 2017-04-12 15:23:10
No, clients are free to choose their server/blockchain. Next release of the client will have user configurable blockchain checkpoints.
@_date: 2017-04-12 15:31:09
If there is overwhelming consensus, the non-forking chain will be orphaned. If there is not enough consensus for that, there will be two chains. In that case we will need users to be able to split and trade their coins, so that profit-driven miners receive feedback trough market price. Therefore it is important to give users choice.
@_date: 2017-04-19 07:20:22
TLDW: MASF does not require 95% of the hashing power. Miners should signal not only their support for a soft-fork, but also the threshold above which they are willing to follow a soft-fork. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 04:04:33

Electrum seeds contain a version number, in order to ensure backward compatibility of todays seeds with future versions of the software. BIP39 assumes that seeds will never evolve.

yes there is, but the current osx binaries cannot pass bitcoin: links from a web browser, afaik.

can you provide a traceback?
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:27:09
I implemented and removed the support for multiple accounts, because the key hardening makes it impossible to guarantee synchronization of your wallet across devices without accessing the unencrypted master private key or seed. (that is not a problem for trezor, because the device contains the master private key, but it is a problem for software wallets)

yes, two minor bugs were fixed.
@_date: 2016-10-23 09:41:47
Coinbase is not a wallet, it is a Bitcoin bank, that holds your Bitcoins. Web wallets are not really better, because they can steal your Bitcoins. Server-trusting wallets, such as Mycelium or Copay, can display fake transactions, and they can shut down your account anytime they want.
If you do not want to run a full node, you should use a SPV wallet, such as Electrum, Multibit or Breadwallet: these wallets are censorship resistant and cannot display fake information.
here is a recent talk about Electrum, where you can learn about the security and privacy model of various wallets: 
@_date: 2016-10-07 10:09:23
it's fixed here: 
@_date: 2016-10-06 06:52:38
yes, I have been talking with other wallet developers.
@_date: 2016-10-04 18:53:16
No worries, you can keep using the old one. Always make sure you have a paper backup of your seed, though.
@_date: 2016-10-05 13:02:09
Yes, in order to spend your bitcoins you'll need to upgrade the software that runs on the cold storage, because electrum 1.9 creates high-S signatures, which are no longer relayed by the Bitcoin network in order to prevent malleability attacks.

HW1 is supported if you install from source. It is not supported in the current binaries, but we will try to add it soon.
@_date: 2016-10-09 13:08:38
it is still there, but you have to click on the description
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:55:59
it does remember your last opened wallet as default (2.0, not the beta)
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:37:05
you can keep your old seed, but the new system uses compressed keys, which results in shorter transactions that will pay less fees.
@_date: 2016-10-05 03:09:09
what is your OS? are you running a binary executable?
@_date: 2016-10-05 07:11:08
Not yet. Segwit support will be added in the next major release. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:13:41
initially we planned to support multiple accounts within wallets, but this was removed, because it's too complex. I think the right way to have multiple "accounts" is to be able to open multiple wallet files. we will follow that direction, and add a way to view multiple wallets in the GUI
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:54:57
You have to create a new wallet, and select "two factor authentication". Also note that this is a paying service.
@_date: 2015-03-01 20:49:29
When you distribute software that holds money for users, you want to maintain backward compatibility in all cases. In particular, if you give a seedphrase to your users, that seedphrase must be readable by future versions of your software, **forever**. I don't think it is acceptable to say we're going to support bip39 for a while and then stop supporting it because we came up with something better.
Electrum was the first Bitcoin wallet to use mnemonic seed phrases. In order to keep compatibility with old seed phrases, Electrum will need to store its old dictionary in all its future versions, because the encoding was designed in a way that depends on the dictionary. BIP39 is reproducing that exact same mistake, because its checksum calculation requires to store a new dictionnary. A wallet that uses BIP39 will have to keep that other dictionary forever (unless they persuade their users that backward compatibility is not so important :-) )
so no, BIP39 is not good enough to stick with it for a while, because if you start using it then it sticks to you forever
@_date: 2016-10-04 19:15:38
if you have another wallet or webpage open that uses your trezor, it will not be found. close it first.
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:09:10
can this bug be triggered in a reproducible way? 
@_date: 2015-03-03 09:51:31
just click cancel; sorry it's a bug, it should not ask for a password here.

yes, old seeds are recognized by the new versions.
this is likely a connection issue
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:47:18
Please keep in mind that Gavin did not confirm the April 7th date. We have UK downloads of signatures for April 8th.

not with the current version, but this could be added in the future.

old seeds: forever

Electrum lets you spend with 0 confirmations
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:05:59
No we do not store full IP addresses, and we are certainly not willing to share them. see

1. yes
2a. Electrum is decentralized. This means that anyone can run an Electrum server, and the server code is open source. Even if all servers were shut down, you can export your keys easily with the client.
2b. Electrum asks you to backup your seed phrase before you move coins to your wallet. That's all you need.

dev here. Steam probably has a clickable link with the amount, so you don't need to type it?
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:32:23
yes old seeds are still supported. read the release notes
@_date: 2016-05-21 05:30:03
it is pretty simple to detect non-final transactions. inherited RBF is more difficult, it requires the server to signal it.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:03:28
In noob language, you don't have to worry about the BCC fork because the Electrum client will reject servers running BCC. If you are greedy and want to sell your BCC, see

Release Notes:
# Release 2.9 - Independence (July 27th, 2017)
  * Multiple Chain Validation: Electrum will download and validate
    block headers sent by servers that may follow different branches
    of a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead of a linear sequence,
    block headers are organized in a tree structure. Branching points
    are located efficiently using binary search. The purpose of MCV is
    to detect and handle blockchain forks that are invisible to the
    classical SPV model.
  * The desired branch of a blockchain fork can be selected using the
    network dialog. Branches are identified by the hash and height of
    the diverging block. Coin splitting is possible using RBF
    transaction (a tutorial will be added).
  * Multibit support: If the user enters a BIP39 seed (or uses a
    hardware wallet), the full derivation path is configurable in the
    install wizard.
  * Option to send only confirmed coins
  * Qt GUI:
    - Network dialog uses tabs and gets updated by network events.
    - The gui tabs use icons
  * Kivy GUI:
    - separation between network dialog and wallet settings dialog.
    - option for manual server entry
    - proxy configuration
  * Daemon: The wallet password can be passed as parameter to the
    JSONRPC API.
  * Various other bugfixes and improvements.

are you on linux?
can you start Electrum from a terminal, so we see a Traceback?
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:12:53
was it the official 1.9.8 package from the website, or did you pull a git version?
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:06:58
Anonymized logs are kept for one year. The statement we made was not about downloads of Electrum, but about downloads of the PGP signature (which are much less frequent). We have actually already shared the fact that the PGP signature has been downloaded on the next day (April 8th) by some UK IP, just read what etmetm wrote above. We will not publish the IP range, but if Gavin gives us the IP range he was using, we will confirm if it matches.

can you confirm it's a DNS issue?

 how was the old wallet created? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 05:39:20
Electrum servers show no *signature* download from the UK on that date.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:48:31
oh right, protobuf was missing in the list of dependencies. 
I added it since then. the next beta will install correctly.
@_date: 2015-02-05 09:02:01
No you cannot donate to me. If you want to support Electrum, you can donate to the people who operate Electrum servers. You can also install an Electrum server and make it public.

1. One of the important features of Electrum is that you can use several instances of the same wallet on different machines, they will auto-synchronize. This is not possible with BIP44 hardened accounts, unless you ask the user to enter their password from time to time, because you have detected that another instance created an account. Asking users to enter their password when they have not initiated any action is bad in terms of security.
2. Since we already support multiple files, we do not need multiple accounts inside the same file. It would create two hierachical levels that basically perform the same function. In terms of UI, it would add too much complexity. As they say, sometimes "less is more"
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:20:05
it was released today. see

Please do not post a functional link to the malware site here; some people might follow it without reading the context, and search engines will increase its rating.
Malware scanners do not really work. The best protection is to check GPG signatures of the software you download. This will protect you even if the legit website is compromised.

BIP39 is pretty bad... it does not include a version number, so if you start using it with your users, then you are stuck with it, you cannot upgrade anymore. In addition it is not self-consistent, using a hash to derive the seed, but not to derive the checksum. The computation of the checksum requires the wordlist to be part of the standard.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:19:05
can you give more details?
@_date: 2015-02-02 06:15:43
how did you create the previous wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:03:30
run electrum from the command line, with --testnet option
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:48:53
Let me explain. We stopped the first attack by having github take down the repository hosting the malware, and we released Electrum 3.3.2 shortly after that, which mitigates the attack. We decided not to disclose the attack immediately, because the attack is much faster to deploy than the defense. For the defense to be effective, users need to upgrade to 3.3.2, which takes time. In contrast, the attack can be deployed very fast. Disclosing the attack immediately would have increased the number of potential attackers, before most users have upgraded their software.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:21:50
we released it today: 
Note that the fork detection in 2.9 does not apply to BCC, here is why: 
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:36:46
you can use Electrum AND a hardware wallet

I called the support at gandi.net. After a short investigation, they decided to take down the fake website.
@_date: 2016-07-08 07:37:00
Electrum developer here. This is a UX problem. Electrum 2.6.4 does allow you to set the max fee, but you have to temporarily disable dynamic fees. The fee/kb you enter as static fee is used as a maximum when dynamic fees are enabled. I that know this is really confusing, and we have changed that already in the development version. (future 2.7)
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:22:30
I am ThomasV on bitcointalk.org (proof here:  )
We recently moved electrum.org to a new registrar, and upgraded the website to use HTTPS. It looks like the fake website popped up exactly at the same time, from the same registrar (gandi.net). I have emailed their support, and I also reported the abuse by telephone. I asked them to take down the fake site, but they will need to investigate first.
