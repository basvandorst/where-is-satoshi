a part from bakkt and ETFs, the futue is so bright guys!
we can't even imagine how many are the possibilities that blockchain and the tokenized economy brings to change and fasten the developement of our society.
but all this stuff will works for us if we learn how to be responsible of our emotions and our financial education.
don't let people scam you, think twice and DYOR ever.

Buying again btc u demonstrate to the world how fascinating and inspiring bitcoin is. this is the real value of btc. it's a "digital new thing that do amazing things". and maybe most of people that believe in bitcoin would do the same.
I can't imagine how u felt but it should be terrible. kudos for being again in the community.
IMO in the near future btc will be everyday safer and more and more accesible.

"...An ETF is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity,  bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund. ETFs typically own the  underlying assets (such as Bitcoin) and turn that ownership into shares."
When ETFs will be launched massively on the markets, it will be like in the 80' in Europe, when common people learnt and started to use investments founds sold by financial planners.
This is the time when there will be the disclosure of the power of the digital assets to the people, a part of them will shift rapidely to decentralized exchanges.

...it tells a lot about what's happening at large scale. Global economy is growing, world population is growing, public and private entities need new markets to invest in.
Fresh money is printed day by day, but money at the same time is loosing its value, govt need new markets to put cash in.

Cryptocurrency is not a bubble and u can't compare .com bubble and I will tell u why:
\-people now have smartphones
\-5G smartphones on the way
\-people want to do things with their smartphones
\-people want to manage their money
\-want to pay with smth different from obsolete cash fiat money
\-want to track things, foods, access to services etc etc
\-want to have smart and rapid access to information
\-people like to play online and there are ecosystems with millions of people playing online and they have their own currencies which they can exchange and send quickly or buy virtual goods with digital currencies
The world is changing because people have new tools and no one can't stop them from use new technology.
Digital money is one of the consecuences to this changing of habits and needs.

great vision! thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:54:48
Not everyone has the same vision, there's people who do not understand crypto at all at the moment, there's people that already see a future with cryptocurrencies circulating and being adopted and there's people who don't want crypto.
We as early adopters have the responsability of learn and share knowledge in order to make crypto community grow and be abundant.
Of course this crash had cleaned up many people but it is only for this specific moment.
People who has been literally cleaned up from crypto, that have lost money, that abandoned, that called his name out......these people will enter again.
It was not their moment.

i think that the story of bitcoin is fascinating.
people mining bitcoin in 2009 or bought it for cents, then sold them when bitcoin was at $100 or $500 or $1000...a lot of nerds millionaries in very few years, the devs-gurus speaking today at conferences.
the pricing of bitcoin trough the times is a magic event :) and now governments or mega financial institution are involved in crypto and everyone in the financial market is looking at bitcoin as the sacred graal of the new millennium.
This is the real revolution a part bitcoin pricing, the fact that technology always fascinate people and if you mix it with money: booom! you have the perfect alchemy to make people literally fall in love with bitcoin.

yes of course if you know what you are doing, but as a community we have to help new comers in order to have good and healty crypto habits if we want to succeed.
Most of people that's approaching cryptocurrencies have not idea of what thay are doing, so that warning them to avoid bad practices as clicking on pishing scam sites, not DYOR before buying a coin/token, participating to 0value crypto airdrops, try to trading when you are not a trader, buy bitcoin cash thinking of being buying bitcoins, buying used ledger, etc etc is all we have to do as members of this amazing crypto community.
If we start thinking as a **crypto global brand** in which every single people is responsable and help new comers to understand and  make profits inside the community, we will give a good image and all this efforts that we are doing now as early adopters will help to build a strong and healty ecosystem.
