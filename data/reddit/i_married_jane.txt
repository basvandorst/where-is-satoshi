Reversality is actually possible with the BTC network as long as you have a multi-sig system in place with an intermediary should there be disputes. I have actually had instances in which a system like this would have saved me a lot of money. I was the victim of a charge-back scam over ebay in which I was swindled out of $750. Paypal refused to help me out or credit me. Such a charge back scam would not have been possible with a multi-sig crypto payment system in place. I'm sorry but crypto is the future. People doubted the need for personal computing back durign the IBM/Microsoft era and personally I think people doubting cryptocurrency right now are in no less a state of denial than they were. Will crypto replace regular currency and transaction next month or year? No, absolutely not. But to say it will not meet widespread adoption and possibly even dominate over regular currency at some point I think is foolish.

Sorry but socialism is based fundamentally on state control ("redistribution") of assests and the means of production. This inevitably leads to communism and the fall of society. There is no divorcing the two.
And no, European nations aren't socialist. They are just highly regulated capitalistic countries with a few "social" tax-payer funded programs.

Edison knew DC wasn't good for long-distance transmission, but wanted to be the one to win over Tesla and his AC transmission. What Edison failed to be able to see was that while AC is required over long distances it's not a viable option for sensative small electronics (something they did not have back then obviously). So they kinda both won out in the end.

One tiny problem... These numbers are gross income, not net income. When you account for rising rent costs, high interest rates, mortgages, car payments, student loans, the possibility of kids, bills, medical expenses, taxes that continue to further burden the middle class, and other expentitures I would be willing to bet the average American today would end up with much less spending power on average than they would've in the 60s or 70s. Add to the fact that Americans also work more on average that pretty much any other developed nation. I can garuntee you they definitely work more than they did 30 or 40 years ago as well. You could even ask my parents or grandparents, they experienced it first hand. Hell, I remember when my dad worked full-time and my mom worked a little side job and they had enough money to take care of three kids, pay all the bills and still had money left over to take us on a yearly vacations. Now my mother works two jobs while my dad works overtime and today they are constantly trying to make ends meet and we're having to skip on things like medication because it simply isn't in the budget anymore. Very sad... And to make it worse people like you continue to make pervasive the myth that income inequality is just some made up bullshit by "lazy people" who just want more money for nothing when in reality the government and corporate America are like leaches living off the hard work of the middle class.

As far as the ISP data goes, you should already be using a VPN to hide your browsing activity from both your ISP and possible man-in-the-middle attacks. If you're not- then you should really consider the investment. NordVPN is my top pick and their prices are just about too good to be true. They also keep no user logs.
As far as the govenrment trying to regulate the internet- I can only see such an effort being as (if not more) innefective than the war on drugs. Not only are there ways to change your IP and MAC adresses on the fly, but there are also ways to reroute traffic and bounce it off multiple locations before it reaches you (think I2P and Tor).
The internet is not centralized. It's an extremely diffuse network of computers that are all linked together by a complex network (many of which have multiple copies in varies locations around the world called mirrors.
It's so complex that any effort to thrawt it's power will likely be met with failure. Even if they succeed in implemendting their "fast lane" bullshit, some hacker will find a solution around it. The government will always lose in battles like this. ALWAYS. Everyone running this country right now is half-retarded as far as I'm concerned.

An ISP blocking every single VPN service and all of their hundreds of servers when they have dynamic IPs seems almost impossible if you ask me... Also couldn't traffic from slow-laned sites simply bounce their connection off of random nodes and fool the ISP? I'm certain hackers are a lot smarter than the idiots who work at Comcst and will figure out a way. Just like they basically destroyed DRM protection and made it meaningless.

Yeah no fucking kidding. And the assholes (at PayPal) also refuse to take responsibility for any of the chargeback scams which left me fucked out of over $1,000 after selling electronics online. I don't even understand how that shit is legal. If a chargeback request occurs they should just place a hold on the associated account balances and investigate the problem before silenty pulling all of the money from the seller's account and crediting the buyer (kind of like an escrow system, but only as-needed).
And this leads me to the irony of the situation... if I had sold my electronics in exchange for Bitcoin (or any of the major cryptos for that  matter) a charge-back would have been IMPOSSIBLE.

@_date: 2018-03-26 19:39:25
This is easily solved by checking for redundant states across multiple parties. It's the same logic behind why scientists take multiple measurements and look at averages... There are a near unlimited possible number of microstates in a non-ideal system that vary with respect to time so each instance in which you observe or take a measurement you are measuring a completely different system entirely... So the only way to get close to (or know) the true value, is to look at the overall average trend and it's mathematical "fit", and from there you can then evalute outliers as-needed and decide whether they are true values or caused by error. This applies to computing as well.

Update: Called Chase and they very willingly reversed the "ATM" charges on the grounds that I understood that any future transactions involving Coinbase will include this fee. I simply argued that I found it appauling that I was not notified of such changes to a policy that most likely affects thousands of customers by email or any other method, and instead found out through a Coinbase notification. The rep instantly sided with me when I put it in that perspective.
Long story short, I will be looking into credit unions very soon.

I'd love to invest in high-medium risk stocks, but I don't exactly have $10,000 laying around to open an investment portfolio. However, I can throw a couple hundred spare dollars every month into cryptocurrencies.
And let's be real, most of us have student debt. Not exactly wise to throw all of your money money at large investments when you have compounding interest to keep under control.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:08:08
Yup they side with the buyer basically 100% of the time because they don't want to eat the cost of the chargeback or pay fees associated with denying a chargeback request from a creditor or bank.
If you ask me a class-action needs to occur to get these fuckers to change the way they handle chargebacks and claims. With the way it is now, PayPal is essentially aiding and abetting fraudulent activit because the scammers know that the buyer pretty much always wins in claims matters.
I called multiple times trying to get at least a portion of the money back and all they would bother to do was either (a) place the blame on me even though Ebay told me via email that the item was paid for and to ship it ASAP or (b) flat out lie to me and tell me that only Ebay can handle the situation. Of course when I called Ebay numerous times they told me to call PayPal. So right there is a major problem because there is ZERO communication or cooperation between the two companies on an internal level.
Needless to say the first time I called I remained very calm and politely explained my situation to the rep. But then I would became increasingly frusterated as I was getting bounced between "departments" and had to keep repeating my story. By the fifth consecutive call + the 3 or 5 dept transfers per call I felt so denegrated and defeated I literally told the senior manager person that I eventually got to spoke to (who treated me like shit by the way, and basically blamed ME for what happened even though I had no control over any of it) that she's a criminal by proxy and that I hope their shitty company burns to the fucking ground and that she loses her job.
I wasn't even asking for the full amount... all I wanted was at least 50% of the amount I sold it for so at least I wasn't completely screwed and was still denied...
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:05:34
No they're NOT following the rules because the last time I checked transaction fraud is a FELONY charge, meaning it's ILLLEGAL!!!! It's also called THEFT and their service + the way that they conduct their claims and disputes creates an environment in which it makes it incredibly easy to scam honest sellers and get completely away with it and that is NOT okay. I don't really care "how it's supposed to be". They side with the buyer to avoid having to make things right with the seller and honor their seller protection policies so that they can inturn make more money and make their precious shareholders happier with million dollar bonuses! Yayy!! So they're basically directly passing the cost of their company shrink onto the sellers that use their service... Pretty fucked up if you ask me. That's what it always comes down to with these greedy companies... money. Bottom line is their service allows for criminal activity to take place at a very high rate and if you don't think they know this you're just as dumb as their shitty company model. Period. There is no argument. What they are doing to sellers is wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!!!!! 
Scammers are scumbags that should be in a jail cell and PayPal is just like "Yeah we'd rather fuck over the seller despite striking evidence of wrongdoing against you". Had a judge made the descision I would've won the dispute. It's no different than walking into a Besbuy and walking out with a computer without paying for it... Theft is theft and crime is crime. So yeah sure whatever... go ahead and make excuses for people who are of such low moral standards that they can't get a fucking job like the rest of us and actually pay for their shit.
