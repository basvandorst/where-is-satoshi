That's crazy that you need to pay both on the income and the gain.

I mean ya but I shouldn't be forced to do that.

Okay so that kind of answers my question. You pay on the income and not on the gain.

Didn't buy it, earned it. I didn't purchase it on Coinbase it was given to me as payment for service. That's why I'm confused. This wasn't really an "investment" it was payment for a job but the currency just happened to go up.

Sorry, forgot this was an international thing. I'm talking about the US.

I'm being taxes on the income and then being taxed on the conversion. If I was paid in Euro I wouldn't have to pay taxes when I convert it to USD, even if the Euro became stronger against the Dollar.

Thanks, I know this whole thing is confusing so I'm just asking around and trying to figure it out.

For people who actually bought into Bitcoin and treated it like an investment I'd say that was true but for people who were making side income and getting paid in Bitcoin I'd say it's a waste of time. The less than $1000 in Bitcoin I make a year isn't going to have any affect on the economy.

Ya but what about future transactions? Like if never bought Bitcoin but just got it from faucets and similar methods, how would they track you if you just stopped using Conibase and had all future transactions sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

FDIC? Like if the exchange were to disappear the Federal Reserve would give the money back?

I know it's the right thing to do but taxes are such a ripoff. Governments just tax you when you're rich and they leave you to die when you're poor.

You're more responsible than most people I've met.


People who don't pay taxes know definitively that they don't have less money because Uncle Sam didn't take it from them.

You're also supposed to pay taxes if you make money mowing someone's lawns or make any type of income. You don't see college students filling out 1099 forms for odd jobs that pay them in cash.
