@_date: 2015-12-14 23:33:53
rise of price make more spent with btc (i ordered 2 things with btc.. i never did that before (i'm probably not the only one))
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:56:35

last year i was running it with a 1.5mbits out without any problem... you can set --maxuploadtarget=500 and core will try not to surpasse 500mo/day of upload
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:32:32
most people are just dumb sadly :(
@_date: 2017-02-19 15:19:09
@_date: 2017-02-20 01:00:18
you don't allow incoming connection ... youre node give nothing to the network except taking bandwith
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:14:07
not enough :'(
@_date: 2017-02-07 12:44:36
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:48:24
node with 13.0 have segwit code too no ?
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:34:42
open port 8333 on your router :)
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:39:00

i dont understand why more country don't do that 
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:32:34
damn i tought u was the troll here... or the inneducate
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:58:53
it's normal you don't allow incoming connection
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:24:52
other coins dont have any utility except maybe.. i repeat maybe XMR. So they dont have any transaction. Yess we need to scale with the most little blocksize. I dont want, and we really dont need to see someone buying a coffee on the first layer. Maybe if you run a node you will undersand. Bitcoin is decentralization, if you want the contrary... just use paypal
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:00:16
are you really so stupid ?
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:29:34
join the 50%+ core running node
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:10:14
yeah u probably right sry
@_date: 2016-03-17 17:45:43
 
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:56:10
i was thinking banning BU node on my node... Don't need to do it :P
@_date: 2016-01-07 01:20:35
I dont understand why block dont increase 'like' difficulty ... if 95% of the block are 80% full... double the blocksize limit. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:42:25
spend them !!!! but buy more :)
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:23:17
bigger block is a threat to decentralisation.. at the moment 144 mo is added by day for storing the blockchain... if we put block a 4 mo... it's 576 mo... do you really think all node can handle that easily ? and the bw for support that too will explode... my node can support a 2 mo block... but dont ask me and problably many other person to store a 4 mo block
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:56:07
damn ... just no
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:50:10
Yeah USA vote for Trump too.....
@_date: 2016-03-30 14:19:22
we need to optimize the blockchain before grow block for nothing. Devellopement take time... 
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:26:41
did you open port 8333 on your firewall/router ?
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:00:25
if u want to pay greater fees... yeah.. if not open this 2nd layer for keeping decentralization
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:03:39
large block will kill a lot of node.. like mine
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:53:03
stupid was not enough strong i think...

    SegWit is expected to be released in April 2016.
    The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.
    If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:50:37

@_date: 2019-06-26 17:13:55
Not funny... This guy is dead. And he have steel ball for not trying to stop himself with other car waiting to take the boat. This guy probably kill himself to save a lot of other innocent people.

Nice BigThx !
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:33:50

Give a usb with your seed word encrypted on it to the person you want. And just leave the password to decrypt it in your will. But... Don't kill yourself. Life is nice and fun. You are lucky to be alive!

@_date: 2017-04-04 17:25:43
maybe they accumulate enough btc at low price with all this FUD they spread and can move foward to the only viable option....
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:46:13
what about fees ?
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:31:21
any legitimate way to get fiat for free ?
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:32:13
isn't only fees... it's the size of the transaction too !

@_date: 2017-09-08 14:51:17
What is the utility of ETH ?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:23:29
You need to be pretty stupid for supporting BCash
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:10:28
Nice :) thx m8 !
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:04:37
Utily is scamming people ?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:53:13
So.. U just like them because you can sell them to greater fools ?
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:39:20
Thx for all your hard work m8 !
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:19:25
Yeah i understand it... That's why i didnt get the hype around it. RSK can do all what ETH do .. But on the Bitcoin blockchain (the most secure public blockchain) with less limitation
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:07:24
Bitcoin is pseudoanonymous

Nice more BCH to DUMP :D thank you roger for these free BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:52:26
ETH is a corporate coin... is clearly not the same thing... centralisation vs decentralisation
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:22:18
Are you ready to lost your life saving ?
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:34:41
yeah dump them
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:30:37
You must be pretty stupid to think someone will use your shitcoin in the future... Make block bigger is just a lazy way to try to resolve scaling. Roger want your money and you fall directly in his trap. Sad for u. Sry for your future lost
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:45:42
Bitcoin have a utility at least
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:24:45
so if i understand well.. roger didnt dump all his BTC for his BCH ShitCoin ?
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:25:44
ETH = ecoin 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:36:02
The good question is why people bought ETH :p
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:23:53
Im more than agree that small block is the key to decentralization. Everybody who is concern about decentralization dont want big block. If you connect to dot.. You can see Roger Ver and Juhan just want to be able to use theur asicboost patent
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:30:50
You can buy bitcoin on coinbase with a credit card
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:11:09
Haha i made the same thing :p
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:56:26
Drugs ? I bought a lot.of think with Bitcoin.. But no drugs

@_date: 2018-04-23 18:59:22
They are plenty of other coin with more utility than BCash.. So no... BCash can't be  Just look at dogecoin.. It's faster.. Cheaper and it's more use then your precious Roger son BCash
@_date: 2019-09-13 17:41:55
Scammer gonna scam

@_date: 2016-10-20 01:06:57
@_date: 2015-11-25 21:21:22
i think  can be a good option.. only picture verification for ur credit card and they are fast to respond... or any bitcoin ATM 
@_date: 2016-10-07 19:48:38

but for using the blockchain.. u need bitcoin ?
@_date: 2016-05-27 13:40:04
you forget the speculator
@_date: 2015-03-15 14:29:23
i think weselldoge.com can be a good option.... u can buy 15 $ / day of dogecoin... just go on an exchange to trade them vs btc after !
@_date: 2016-05-13 22:45:37
good question
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:17:16
not all time true... u can get good deal if u watch well and be patient a little bit
@_date: 2016-10-09 14:07:15
it's pretty instant when u have send ur email
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:43:01
for a such small amount... i think wesellcrypto.com can ben a good option. u can buy 15$/ day with paypal with only a email verification. but... huge fee (15%)
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:38:49
Use quadrigacx ! u can send money without verification with money order ! simple fast and secure ! or an ATM like btcfun tell !
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:34:38
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:38:42
yeah... after the first buy it's instant
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:35:22
Just buy more than you spend !
@_date: 2016-05-22 15:34:11
u can get it on openbazaar too 
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:03:17
the price spiked because a new bubble is coming soon... it crashed because bitcoin XT... just give it time we will return to 300
@_date: 2016-05-01 16:01:23
@_date: 2016-05-12 17:14:57
@_date: 2015-10-09 13:42:09
 can be a good option i think.... a lot of fee (15%) but no verification need apart an email for small order. U will be able to pay with paypal
@_date: 2016-05-22 14:10:00
i bought a silverwallet coin and the experience was great !

BCH copy it and push it in hurry (not the better implementation of schnorr signature. u/nullc made many comment about that. Bitcoin will have a better implementation with more feature with it. It's only another PR attemps from roger and his friends.
