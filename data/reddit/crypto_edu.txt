Where the heck do you live that it's so bleak?
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:46:34
My man!!
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:05:21
I see your side, but I think they won't be given a choice. Power is within the people and this is what everyone needs to realize. 
If we hate taxes its because they aren't used right. US has abused it people mostly due to military spending. Hell if they spent 1/4th what they did in the last 5 yes alone every city in the US would greatly have benefitted.
I think over time this will come with adoption, it won't be perfect but there will be more transparency or there will be more France situations
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:36:53
Okay miscommunication clearly. What I'm saying is if we want things taxes help but they are grossly mismanaged. Honestly put all taxpayer $$ on Blockchain and then we at least can know what it's being used for
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:22:02
Not if the people don't invest in it
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:16:21
He already knows!! But the rest of the world is soon to follow
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:02:57
Nice considering I have no business or reason to look so deep at the UK I didn't dive deep as I would have for countries I am associated more closely to. 
Thanks for the more detailed updates.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:42:25
I meant like government's more not the illuminati lol
@_date: 2019-01-07 14:35:11
It does but ETFs do not mean mass adoption. They likely mean paper backed BTC or iou's. This will dilute a lot so ya
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:47:22
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:10:36
I agree we need taxes but how much? 25-50%, on every trade like the US? I want the community to share what they feel is acceptable and fair out of this narrative
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:20:11
You get down voted a lot btw. Realism hahaha. It's called reality you bumbling idiot. Go continue on how ETFs are better than leaving your coins in an exchange. Oh I didn't know it mean exchange Traded Fund
@_date: 2019-01-07 15:56:55
It's funny ETF stands for
Exchange Traded Fund hahahaha you sir need to sit down and take off the stupid hat
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:27:35
Casinos are rigged to win though. So why gamble when you already win? If these people didn't think or already know where crypto is going you really think they would be investing
@_date: 2019-01-07 14:51:43
Wrong again. People can buy crypto like stock and forex already. They sign up to those exchanges same as they do for ETFs. All it does is have custody solutions for them as they don't have to hold the BTC. Guess what? Other services already exist for that. There isn't much benefit like you say here.
Your arguments:
1. Investors aren't gonna sign up for a wallet or exchange - they already do for trading everything else and if looking to just buy the main cryptos they can easily. 
2. People in markets right now that ur talking about as the target market all do KYC and won't have any issue submitting documents for verification they are used to this!
3. What you said here
It doesn’t work like that. ETF means these people can buy BTC like they buy stocks. Safely and easily.
Biggest load of bullshit. - so coinbase isn't safe or easy? What I said above nullifies all of your arguments here.
Why do you comment like you have an idea how markets work when your knowledge is so limited? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:18:50
With you there for sure! People only follow and do zero research. This guy said how can you trust your money left in exchange. Then is arguing for an Exchange traded fund. Seriously some in the space are the reason why mass adoption takes so long haha
@_date: 2019-01-01 15:53:47
1. We have the US taxing every trade
2. We have Netherlands taxing at the end of the year based on profit/loss
3. Should we be like Germany, Belarus, Singapore, and Slovenia and have Zero crypto tax? - I think this is ideal but not realistic.
4. These countries are basically exempt because they do not have capital gains tax: [Hong Kong, New Zealand, Switzerland, Barbados]( [Malaysia]( [Mauritius](
5. The UK does this currently:
* Under £11,851 no taxation
* Proceeds between £11,851 and £46,350 attract a 20 percent tax
* Proceeds between £46,351 and £150,000 attract a 40 percent tax
* Proceeds above £150,000 attract a 45 percent tax.
6. Canada - taxing crypto the same as other taxes using the Income Tax act - 25-50% of gains :S
7. South Korea - currently no tax but it is coming in the form of capital gains tax
8. Japan is taxing between 15-55% but they recently said lets make it a flat 20% and likely more for those who make more then 40m Yen a year
So my question to everyone is what is the best option? Not just for you personally but for society, for the growth of the industry, for mainstream adoption!
The article stipulates that we may not be able to reach mass adoption until the taxation issues are figured out.
My question is do you believe that and what is the best option? 
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:50:34
Is it really that bad out there? Had no idea other then france
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:29:56
I'm not I'm asking why so many others are
@_date: 2019-01-07 15:14:17
You just answered your own question about the ETFs lol. So what exactly do ETFs do? Do you hold your crypto? Or does the centralized authority hold it for you? 
Wake Up! Do you work, speak, panel,MC in crypto? Do you know CEOs of many projects? I think not and you just want to be right but this thread is easy proof you are not well educated and need to understand what an ETF even is or does because it seems you are confused by all of this and probably got your info from a person not your own research
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:09:30
Do you like thinks like roads, healthcare, public services etc? Well they don't fund themselves either. Taxes suck and are too high for sure but you can't say no tax works because it won't and society will fall apart without them. We need just fairer taxation like what France is fighting for
@_date: 2019-01-07 15:08:50
Mate if you knew how entrenched I am in the industry you would realise you are the one out of your depth here.
The fact you do not even realise coinbase has wallets built in as all exchanges do is freaking sad and now you should stop because it's obvious you have no idea what you are talking about.
I love how you used the word actuality lol did you mean reality? Also the reality is we have had BTC and crypto and the industry has grown exponentially regardless of price this past 2years. Adoption is constant and we don't need an ETF for it. Can it help? Maybe but does it help the space not really as ETFs ppl won't hold BTC physically and they could create BTC that they don't have with paperbacked loans. 
It doesn't matter seems that this type of stuff may go over your head anyways.
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:16:48
Thanks man! Appreciate it lots of know it all's in the space. They get weeded fast though. I find it so fucking funny how I work in crypto full time been an investor since 2013 but people have the audacity to say I'm a noon and know nothing. As a former business educator in high schools as well I just let the children talk after it's clear they are horses who don't drink when led to water lol
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:05:45
Did caramel make your day from his intelligence lol
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:11:46
That's what's currently in place unless there we're new rules I missed of course. I think they are going with this for now same as Canada is doing but if I'm incorrect pls do correct me as this stuff is bound to see tons of changes
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:53:00
I know it's almost like making all new rules that are fair specific to crypto would be smarter long term
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:30:42
Yeah ppl don't get it, what's worse is those of us who do they never listen to then wonder why they get rekt
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:55:51
Yes but you probably have the money what about those who don't? Private road are all you use I'm calling bullshit on that. I'm calling bullshit you don't need police, firefighters, garbage removal, public services and much more. Sorry but taxes make the world work and without them look at what happened after the Roman empire fell to give you an example
@_date: 2019-01-09 10:52:04
You know it giddy up
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:31:10
When at any time did I say only crypto exists?
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:13:19
Yep you got it points for you zero for caramel lol
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:56:36
Due to government shutdown they say that their licenses wouldn't be ready in time..I haven't been able to confirm for sure from BAKKT but I have confluence from several other sources saying yes it's delayed
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:52:15
That's in the system they understand they really don't understand this one just trying to use the $$ to position themselves 
@_date: 2019-01-07 15:55:39
Who is this directed at myself or the other member?
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:53:55
Thanks for that mate I'm not from the UK so wasn't sure. Thanks for clarification
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:53:05
Means they are coming to the decentralized world. The world they don't know yet nor understand and I love it
@_date: 2019-01-07 14:40:59
That makes no sense though. They can buy Bitcoin on an exchange. ETFs are more country to country based so how does it help with mass adoption? Japan which is like 60% of the crypto volume already has tons of access. Your logic here is flawed. Also mass adoption doesn't come via ETFs lol. It comes from people using crypto and blockchain technologies and integrations into the current systems which eventually will be adapted to the new system completely. I'd you think ETFs bring mass adoption you are wrong the places that have ETFs already had tons of options to buy actual BTC.
So you are actually very far off here.
@_date: 2018-12-21 03:17:40
We have probabilities though 
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:15:32
Bcash is the problem and why we have gone deeper into this mess. The catalyst was the Hash wars to push it down!
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:17:02
It's gonna be amazing. Trust me I know and I have people great people people with smart minds 
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:16:27
No see I bought btc in 2013 lol. I am still up like 30X or so.
Fake internet money, thats cute maybe you should be more involved in the space before saying this industry is even in trouble its simple its not. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:56:12
Bitcoin has lost 80% before but that was previous market cycles. They even say it can go to 0 or 100k lol. Like wow good analysis we know that idiots lol. They actually are so clueless its sad!
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:13:05
Yeah guys crazy how this actually existed so long ago!! I got my first BTC in 2013 when did you get yours?
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:56:26
You sound like someone.... Hmm who could it be lol
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:02:59
100% agree with that.
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:30:31
LOL Balina gonna get fucked!
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:33:53
Good question lol
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:55:39
Please explain why this is a terrible video? All info is not from one site it's pretty clear to me the info is sound if you dig yourself. So please let us know why you think that I am cool with saying that but context or it's just trolling 
@_date: 2018-12-21 03:14:19
I say this because traders that I know coming from stocks n forex into crypto are far different traders than crypto traders. They will try to drive the price down one more time if they haven't done it already.
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:28:12
Umm ask people who didn't and now are FUCKKED!! 
Anarchy wont work when this is mainstream and ppl evading taxes when caught gonna have the book thrown at em!!
Not even actors can get out of jailtime!
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:10:07
Good but trust me I knw regulators and they are gonna come after ppl esp if you bought via coinbase and have a linked bank
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:47:57
Not final completely. But the narrative has changed and they want to find a way to regulate and work with the industry because they probably do not want to fall behind. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:28:59
You have to deposit $$ to buy unless it was all local bitcoins and trust if you think the government really have no idea you are gonna have a nasty wake up call I am not saying this because I like it I am saying it so ppl dont fuck up and end up in jail
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:11:57
Hello Darkness, my old friend...... BCASH is looking like the trash..... I wonder why. LTC takes back 7th place as BTRASH slips further!!!
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:04:32
Government decisions have you opened your eyes. Do you know people in government positions and their take on it? I know for a fact 1 G8 country already has full regulations ready. I agree some governments will be late to the party that will just hurt them though!
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:47:23
True but better then the usual we are banning it narrative
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:57:30
100% HARDETH they really are not sure what is going on and honestly its just sad they even comment about it like they have a clue. Harvard this is sad!
@_date: 2018-12-21 09:53:45
Umm this isnt an ETF this is for a physically backed future 
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:34:45
Big league bigly lol
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:49:48
Damn man sorry to hear it brother
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:47:00
LOL I love that btw lol
@_date: 2018-12-21 03:16:50
If they haven't already dumped it expect to see another before they come online.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:35:13
Not yet but it's in their plans
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:58:39
I just hope you guys do realise if you make millions and do not pay tax and the government finds out, which btw the US government knows approximately who owns 80% of addresses already then when they come to collect jailtime will suck. I know its easy for us to say one thing, but reality will hit some hard and jailtime will suck. Just be careful its easy to say and do that but when you get caught its not okay!
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:12:56
Bottom likely 2500 or so
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:26:08
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:28:09
Why? its relevant to bitcoin is it not?
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:29:22
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:34:26
Thanks brother!
