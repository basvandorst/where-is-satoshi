I have a question, and sorry if this is silly or has been answered a billion times, I am new to btc! Basically How does one guarantee that a merchant paid in bitcoin is not gonna just run with the money without delivering the purchased good, WITHOUT relying on a 3rd party service to act as escrow?
If a 3rd party escrow is still needed, wouldn't that make the "value" of bitcoin as a payment system somewhat insignificant?

Fair enough. I guess it still is a great cash payment system akin to something like Western Union without all the bullshit regulations and fees (I think WU is irreversible as well!).

can you elaborate for a layman? As far as I understand, debt, even with low interest, is not something you want to hold onto long term, much less “build wealth” with ��

I know it’s a long shot and i honestly don’t know much about history of the either, but does MtGox (before it went bust) being based in Japan and the Bitcoin mystery founder having a Japanese alias have got anything to do with each other?

From the full [interview](


How does one create a clearnet website while remaining fully anonymous? And surely clearnet websites like this (specially ones that are in direct link to the actual SilkRoad, as per the interview) are likely to get taken down and investigated by LE? I realise DPR is probably not stupid enough for the website to be traced back to him or anything compromising SilkRoad, but I am merely interested in the technicalities of this.

You buy 0.001 BTC, most exchanges allow for many more decimal places than this (I think). It's not called mBTC all around yet, but might eventually happen (not necessarily mBTC in particular, just something to denote a small fraction that will eleminate the need for typing so many decimal places)
