Liking it so far!  Made an account :)
just a crit - make your audio players not take up the full width.  it gets a little too long.  Also, it needs a renaming feature (though I'm sure you're working on that.) other than that I'm loving the design.  
Also what are the rights on uploaded songs?  CC?

Thanks.  I just find it so odd that their ToS *permit* this... I mean, it seems like something pretty bad for their business and the customer.  And if what said above is correct, and that they do this often, I guess they're just relying on the pure mass of people they serve instead of good service.
It's a shame, because they were about flawless until right now in my eyes.

I think a lot of people just read the headline and jumped to "Warren buffet is dum"

Question for a noob: isn't it still decentralized since coinbase doesn't control the actual nature of bitcoin?  Wouldn't coinbase just be a self-contained node in the whole system of bitcoin?

That's a pretty nice chip you've got there on your shoulder.

Ahh, okay.  That makes sense.

Is it bad if I'm personally apathetic about this particular fact?  I appreciate Coinbase's simplicity, professionalism, and I'm not very concerned about them tracking what I purchase.
Being said, they have suspended my account from purchasing any Bitcoin.  They never told me why, and I had to send them support emails twice after my purchase requests were rejected.  I haven't purchased anything in around 6 months.
Email I just got:
"I understand your frustrations regarding canceled orders.
Per the user agreement, please note that Coinbase may cancel or reverse purchases of bitcoin. You can review our user agreement here: 
Unfortunately, we cannot divulge specifics on the eligibility for purchases as such information can be used by illicit actors to exploit our platform. Thank you for your understanding.
Your account is still eligible to sell Bitcoin, use our wallet, and our vault features. I’m sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused, and hope in the future we’ll be able to better serve you."
Time to terminate my account.  Any good suggestions on what to switch to?

Yeah, I'll have to do that.  But I'm more interested in whether this is something Coinbase has been known to do.

That's why I derive enjoyment from buttcoin.  They're just as ridiculous as me spending way too much on bitcoin.

I've had quite a few troubles with Coinbase, but they're very good at keeping an environment for those who aren't very interested in the technical side of things, but just want to use bitcoin.  I wouldn't say they're for the universal monitoring of bitcoin, though they do so with those who use their services.

Although I'm not completely up to date on Bitcoin, I would say that other exchanges were doing this - e.g. MtGox before it crashed, or Bitstamp and other alike services.  These sites allowed trading between members at user-set prices - like a stock market, whereas Coinbase only allowed purchasing at the current exact average.  Now that Coinbase allows trading, they're both a "bank" and a Bitcoin Market.  Or at lest AFAIK.

Very true.  Advice for coinbase users:  support is always unhelpful.  They will not do anything until you threaten to cancel your account or take legal action.  Emailed them 4 times about am issue, they said they could do nothing until I asked for my account to be cancelled.  Then they magically fixed my problems!
