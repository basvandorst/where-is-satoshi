How will the futures market affect the 100k prediction?

Not at all. At $1 trillion, a $300B marketcap is basically a third of the entire market.

How does one go about shorting bitcoin?

What are the chances that this is how the name was created?

No more than it did during the previous Bitcoin bubbles. You basically asked "How much of a bubble does this have to look like before people stop calling it a bubble?"

I have heard that the invention of quantum computers would render bitcoin hackable. If this is true, wouldn't that knowledge temper people's desire to put their gold money into bitcoin? Gold isn't perfect but it has a long history and it's a pretty good, secure store of value.

Idiotic. Their reasons were completely valid.

According to the OP it will be in 2018.

I think he's implying that this guy is just here to lower demand for/confidence in bitcoin, perhaps so people sell theirs and he can buy some more when the price drops. 
I think it's characteristic of the delusion on this subreddit that anybody who claims to doubt the value of bitcoin is thought to actually just be a trickster who really does believe in bitcoin.
Either that, or this person thinks reddit is the only place to get accurate information on bitcoin.

This just assumes that more and more people will buy it. That doesn't seem like a warranted assumption. There are many things less than 1% of the world's population have done/bought. This does not mean that many more people will begin to do/buy those things.

That's the thing. It's impossible to know:
1) when it will burst
2) how low it will go
3) what it will ultimately stabilise at (say, 5-10 years from now)
These are the three things you would need to know before answering any of these bubble questions. They aren't knowable, and so any answers to them are speculation. Some speculation is better informed than other speculation, but the point remains - nobody knows.

And from those who are. This is a bubble to rational people, regardless of whether they have invested.
