So does the IRS BUY data? Could a bitcoin casino SELL any email/name/associated btc addresses they have to the IRS?

Trump is so awesome that he forces liberals to change the definitions of words.

Maybe he just robbed a stripper

Depending how much cash do it at a police station. Or leave the cash in your car until you meet the person and are sure they aren't going to rob you.
@_date: 2019-07-22 04:42:13
You are correct. This is meant for exchanges or any other bitcoin related service. There are already laws as to what is abandoned.

Exchanges. They are doing this for exchange accounts.

What if the fees go up 300% in a week?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:34:39
Right and makes it impossible to do transactions under a certain amount.

Ok mom and dad give YOUR money back. The bank still looses its entire investment, money spent on employees, buildings, lawyers, taxes, marketing, etc. So.... what is your point? By depositing you take no risk. In money, low risk = low reward. You want risk buy their stock.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:04:40
Why doesn't McDonalds give us 50% discount off the profit margin? And then once they do that do it again. After all they are making money on my money.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:03:34
Why don't you loan out your own money then instead of putting it in a bank account? Why should they take all the risk, put up millions of dollars to be able to start a bank, and then give you money just to use their service?  Like I said, use a credit union. I get checks every year from mine.
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:36:53
So now you want to be an employee, not a depositor. And no, banks fail every year and don't get bailed out. What president bailed out the biggest banks?
EDIT: Hint: Not Trump
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:27:30
Most banks only GAMBLE by giving you a loan...
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:41:40
Which of these banks were bailed out? 
Hometown National Bank, Longview, WA 	10/02/2015 	1.6
The Bank of Georgia, Peachtree City, GA 	10/02/2015 	23.2
Premier Bank, Denver 	07/10/2015 	4.4
Republic Bank of Chicago, Chicago 	05/08/2015 	16.8
Doral Bank En Espanol, San Juan, Puerto Rico 	02/27/2015 	748.9
Capitol City Bank &amp; Trust Company, Atlanta 	02/13/2015 	88.9
Highland Community Bank, Chicago 	01/23/2015 	5.8
First National Bank of Crestview, Crestview, FL 	01/16/2015 	4.4

And losses? Should they take cash out of your account if they lose money?
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:25:23
Lawsuit spreads awareness. Duh. Tons of people in the courtroom, attorneys, etc all learning in and outs of crypto.

But taxpayers might not have a bank account. So taxpayers are subsidizing the profits of depositors in that case.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:59:19
That doesn't really address why they were charged with criminal trespass and strong armed robbery. They weren't charged for conspiracy to commit strong armed robbery. So did they rob someone or not?
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:55:30
I don't need to Google it. Why should they charge you? You are a customer! You can not be charged by leaving it in your mattress. I didn't comment on abusiveness. If you jump to conclusions about what people think then you are a fucking idiot plain and simple.
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:06:22
The title is weird... it says conspiracy.. but the charges listed say "residential strong armed robbery" and some "criminal trespass".... so did they go into a home and try to rob someone or just role play?
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:19:42
So as a depositor you want something with 0 risk and a part of the reward. Yeah ok. The government doesn't "cover their losses" they cover the deposits. Ever see how many banks actually do fail every year? There are plenty
Edit: Also, plenty of credit unions DO share their profits with members. What you want already exists its just not called a bank.

And the bank accidentally gives you $10k and you go to prison for spending it.

I would use some of it to pay for things for strangers to throw people off. For example 1000 facebook likes for some random small band I don't even like and lives 1000 miles away.

Was that customers private key or atm owners? It was a sell transaction log

Literally sounds like you just need to plug a keyboard into the ATM to steal everything....

Yeah If I started a bitcoin wallet service in 2009 and it had billions just sitting there in "inactive" accounts i'd close it down fast.

Not being in crypto is a risk. Being all in crypto is a risk. Being partially in crypto is a risk. Going to sleep is a risk. Getting out of bed is a risk. Being all in crypto is a bigger risk than being all in US dollars as of the time of this writing.

So regardless of the costs, you will redistribute everything you get to former customers right? Many arent even part of BK and get nothing... so... promise you will pay back everyone you scammed.
