Such a sensitive little boy.  Read through the comments.

Also, why does it even give you the option to enter the second password if it will just return NULL regardless of what you enter....

- Denial: "No way this is happening."
- Anger: "Fuck! This is happening!."
- Bargaining: "If only I backedup/soldout/changed PW sooner!!"
- Depression: "Oh fuck, what am I going to do now."
- Acceptance: "Life will not be the same but I must move on."

Yup I got it!!  If I saved as html from textedit it did not work.  I had to convert it to plain text (instead of rtf) and just changed the extension manually from txt to html.

In all seriousness, I guarantee you every poor MF who got screwed by Gox is at one point of that scale right now.  Whether or not you feel bad for them is another story entirely.
In short, bad shit happens and we are all cold, logical animals when our brain tries to process how to deal with it.

I don't think a second password is all that complicated... if it would work the way it a user is told it will.

I wasn't calling you a fucker. I was referring to the people up above who took it as intended (because they have a sense of humor and also understood it as a show of solidarity). You must be great at parties.

Are you deeply offended, redditor cadet86?

How do I implement your code?  Do I just save the text as an html file and open offline?  Its been a loooooong day.
@_date: 2014-03-16 06:05:11
OK, I copied the raw data into a text file and saved as an html, but when i open it in a browser it is still just text.  Sorry for my confusion... my brain is fried.

I know, I would never equate losing money to losing a loved one.  I hope it didn't sound crass the way I said that.  I just thought the same progession of feelings could be applied to anything terrible happening.

I'm glad my night ended on a philosophical note.

My only mistake was assuming their OWN offline decrypt tool would work on their OWN wallet, which doesn't really seem too much to ask!!! In my mind, the only other possibility was that I had mistyped this heinously complex PW into their graphical keyboard when the wallet was created and had the wrong PW since day one.  That would make anyone freak out.
If your gas pedal don't work as described by the dealership on your test drive... does that constitute a misunderstanding of how the car works?

WILL U B MY FREND?!?? ???
EDIT: more question marks

Once I sort this shit out I'm sending you a donation.  Mark my words (redditor for 12 minutes) LOL
For real though, this is a throwaway but I am no stranger :) We need more people like you to make this whole btc thing work.

In an effort to clarify and also illuminate why this was especially stressful:  I've spent several months wrapping my head around Armory offline storage and finally got it to work comfortably with small amounts...
I just got a dedicated air-gapped computer all set up and I had put today aside to make "the move" into true cold storage and I ran into this whole shit.
The whole reason I tried the offline decrypt in the first place was to avoid ever even having to log into blockchain.info ever again!!!  I feel like I'm losing my mind.

JESUS H COIN!!!  How the fuck did I miss this?!!? Thank you man.

I find myself taken very literally at odd times on this subreddit.... I think its because cryptography/mathematics enthusiasts are all about concrete connections, not abstract trains of thought.  From a science background, I could apply that progression towards breaking my pinky toe and it still works.
