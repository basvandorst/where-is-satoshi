Well, basically instead of opening OpenBazaar store, you could upload special CMS on your web-hosting, which would deploy very fast (or even create 1-click web-hosting provider which will automatically copy web-interface e.g. it could be integrated with Softaculous which comes with every cPanel)
Imagine customer browsing your web-site where you sell stuff. When customer needs to buy something he press BUY NOW button, where he would be offered to install one of the Bitcoin wallet which supports multisig - or scan XML/JSON contract, signs it, includes its hash into transaction when buyer makes a purchase, and send those contracts to acknowledge moderator &amp; seller.
Seller has a key, and Moderator are defined by an agreement between buyer and seller. This doesn't takes any software. All it takes - 1) web-site, 2) wallet.
I don't see why copay wouldn't build such an easy tool like "scan QR code to start contract", because this would replace the whole OpenBazaar's functionality and give more flexibility to a seller, and also for buyer - it would make the process of browsing stores even easier, because OpenBazaar at its current version has too much offline nodes, and has no multitasking, while web-sites have necessary multitasking.

Actually $1,000,000 will be divided into $25,000 grant batches which will go only to the talented ones who are closest to Pavel Durov, typical Russian scheme.
