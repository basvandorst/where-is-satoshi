That's awesome!
This is what bitcoin is about: buying stuff with bitcoins!

I've got some old Nintendo consoles for my future grandchildren to play with so we'll be fine.
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:05:38
Thanks! 
So when you restore your btc wallet and the receiving addresses are not visible in the wallet it still receives all btc send to the first 100 addresses?
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:23:56
So let's make moneyfrom it while we can and convert it to 'regualr' currency?
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:13:41
That's kind of pretty big news, will get a lot of people more trust in bitcoin and other digital currencies!

Great, but only thing that's weird is they advertise GPU's for bitcoin mining. GPU's for bitcoin are as good as useless since ASIC's rule. They're fine for scrypt but alt coins aren't mentioned.

There were already one or more double spend attacks and people still believe in bitcoin.

When it's &lt;$50 I might buy a few.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:29:35
Thanks for the explanation, the more people own bitcoins the better.
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:05:59
*I want to believe!*

I burned a little, it smelled bad.

Let's hope they are faster with delivery then BF.
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:59:01
I ordered 2 X-1's, most items are delivered really fast from China. Hopefully the difficulty isn't to high by then, last update was lower as expected which is good!

Still regret selling 2btc for &lt;1500, years ago.

I've got skills you will never be able to learn and know a lot you don't know. But that doesn't make you stupid. Sameway asking this question as a newbie in the bitcoin world is just fine.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:03:29
What's wrong with it?
edit: Just discovered r/BitcoinBeginners I shall lurk there, nevermind.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:37:55
You still have to pay for the electricity I guess you will lose money unless the transaction fees increase?
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:29:22
So the future of making money with current bitcoin hardware depends on the volume of transactions. If it truelly will be a full grown and accepted form of payment then there's still hope other wise they're nice pieces of history. Or someone else will find a way to use the ASICS.

People want spoons, but $50 spoons?
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:18:22
Let's hope so.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:36:49
That's probably not possible with hardware build for bitcoin alone.

Don't know it's still installing Windows 8 (or insert some funnier OS).
*"The machine was 25 feet by 50 feet in length, contained 5,600 tubes, 18,000 crystal diodes, and 300 relays. It utilized serial circuitry, 2.25 MHz bit rate, and had an internal storage capacity 1,000 words or 12,000 characters.
It utilized a Mercury delay line, magnetic tape, and typewriter output. The UNIVAC was used for general purpose computing with large amounts of input and output.
Power consumption was about 120 kva. Its reported processing speed was 0.525 milliseconds for arithmetic functions, 2.15 milliseconds for multiplication and 3.9 Milliseconds for division.
The UNIVAC was also the first computer to come equipped with a magnetic tape unit and was the first computer to use buffer memory.
The first UNIVAC I was delivered on June 14, 1951. From 1951 to 1958 a total of 46 UNIVAC I computers were delivered, all of which have since been phased out."*

Thanks for an informative answer, instead of all the whining.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:02:56
Thanks, I think the value will rise in the coming years due to increasing popularity. But if it will be able to maintain it's current or higher value after that ..
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:21:01
Where will it end? The difficulty can't increase infinity.
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:01:32
I thought one of the prime benefits of Bitcoin was that transaction fees are so low. Should be stupid to destroy that one.
