Not quite because when i made my final decision to buy price was 5.200 but could not move money fast,but still a win!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:52:17
really? how is that possible?i know about gdax but why there are no fees since its coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:13:23
i can afford to lose 5.000$, which is how much i invested
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:19:09
Yes you wont probably see this price again
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:26
The happening is happening! While intensity intensifies!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:27:16
I partially agree with you but the money i used are almost nothing in volume,and as i said i can afford to loose it and i already live with the idea that i have already lost them if you know what i mean,furthermore lucky is not a word i would use in this case because the growth it's inevitable and i never planned or will plan to sell,handling my finances is a thing that i only i have the right to say whether it's right or wrong,and im smart enough to not destroy my life,considering the fact that i used all my saving its not a fact to depend when the amount was only 5k,go take a look at what happens in argentina zibambwe or venezuela,im not saying greece is heading at the same direction but in my opinion that was a very smart move to make at this moment,and by making such a move in something i strongly believe and made a lot of research on doesn't mean that determines other choises i make in my life that will ruin it.

I know right? makes you think that working another day in your life for a retail job is a joke (which it is), but on the other hand you have to sustain yourself and make some money so you can buy a little more and after several years retire :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:12:26
Thanks a lot man,im very optimistic about bitcoin and crypto in general,i believe it will make an enormous impact in the world for the years to come as antonopoulos said and i will continue to invest a part of any savings(not all) i'll make,if i make in the future!
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:40:59
if i type an amount of bitcoin, lets say 0.10 btc, will it display its value on the homescreen? thats what i want :P (i have android)
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:08:25
so if i buy before october 25 will i still claim btg?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:11:31
i just gave a try to electrum (note that im completely new to this) and i created an account at coinbase to test,so i bought 10 euros worth of bitcoin (around 0.0018)but there was a fee that reduced the amount to 8,98 euros worth of bitcoin, then when i sent them from coinbase to electrum it had another fee so i ended up with 6.50 worth of bitcoin (0.0013 i think) my question is, is there a way to buy an amount and keep it as it is? or fees will be there? what if i want to buy a large amount?
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:05:04
i see,thanks a lot for your help!
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:35:18
so you first waiting 1-2 business days for the verification of your bank account, then you waited another 3-5 business days for the funds to be credited, right?
Also, how does sepa work?i must go to my bank and tell them "i want to send these money to this adress" and then wait an answer from coinbase that my account got verified?
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:30:20
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:18:12
Get a hardware wallet,otherwise download electrum
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:55:01
im pretty certain they are legit but, i fear the idea of depositing money to anothers bank account and wait until i get the bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:30:57
When i started experimenting,which is something i suggest you do too before making a big buy,i started buying small amounts like 10€ and moving them between wallets to see how the whole process works,but i lost most of my btc on fees,because when you move an amount of bitcoin expect to have small fee around 2.50€ and a buying fee,anyway back to topic i buy it from coinbase,which is an exchange for bitcoin which needs youe verification with photo of your ID and stuff. There is a fee around 1.5% of the amount when you buy with cards,But i will now buy from gdax which in fact is owned by coinbase,it's the same company,just a different website a liiiittle more conplicated.
TL;DR i used to buy from coinbase,i will now buy from GDAX cause its fee free (its the same company)
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:46:53
do these accept credit cards? if so do they have a limit?
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:42:51
What do you mean i wont be getting any bitcoin off the exchange? im concerned buying before october 25 so ill get bitcoin gold yeah..
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:20:58
Does it really bother you that much that i wanted to make a post instead of searching? if so you indeed are the issue..
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:30:36
im so confused right now as what i have to do lol..
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:18:02
i watched that video and it isnt helping,its about making payments with bitcoin something like that
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:38:20
You have full control of your private keys,i dont know if it will support segwit,most probably it will but get a hardware wallet asap imo... my ledger arrived few days ago and its the best thing ever i swear...
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:58:31
Thanks a lot for your help!
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:35:23
Great!! as long as we both agree you give it back to me when my ledger arrives ok? Bamboozle free!
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:10:32
so if for example i make an account at coinbase and give my personal information (bank account etc etc,keep in mind that i dont live in the US)and decide to sell a x amount of bitcoin,i can choose that the money will go directly in my bank account right? If so the sum will be transfered from coinbase to my bank account,how i can justify to my bank as where these money came from?they would ask me questions cause thats how banks are here in greece, or will coinbase justify it for me?? even if it does, how will the tax imput be implemented so i can have the money in my hands rightfully?based on my countrys tax system? or coinbase's? thanks!!
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:50:53
yes thats what im saying, but in order to make the verification, i must make a small sepa transfer, i have no idea what sepa is or how its done,tha's what im asking. should i go to the bank to do it?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:20:27
My question guys is, when should i buy to claim bitcoin gold as well?? before block  491407?
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:37:15
1. When you say if i feel comfortable keeping my coins on exchange you mean on the website?
2. What happened with and what is MtGox?
3. From what i searched hardware wallet is a physical wallet that you have in ur hands as you mentioned,is it not safe if i have a wallet in my PC and have it on many different hard drives so i wont loose it? (i dont even know if it works that way)
4. My idea was to buy a few (whole) bitcoins and just have them until and if the price rises,so i dont think i would attempt day trading at all.
5. can you give me an answer to this reply i made below "so if for example i make an account at coinbase and give my personal information (bank account etc etc,keep in mind that i dont live in the US)and decide to sell a x amount of bitcoin,i can choose that the money will go directly in my bank account right? If so the sum will be transfered from coinbase to my bank account,how i can justify to my bank as where these money came from?they would ask me questions cause thats how banks are here in greece, or will coinbase justify it for me?? even if it does, how will the tax imput be implemented so i can have the money in my hands rightfully?based on my countrys tax system? or coinbase's?"
Also thanks a lot for your time to answer!!
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:11:23
im investing now, before the fork, and im buying a full bitcoin, i made a post like yours some time ago and a guy answered me "The best time to invest is now, it has always been now" if you catch his point
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:10:23
Thanks!! Hahah still cant believe its that simple but also that hard for someone to take ur funds!
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:45:02
yeah but it says i need to verify my bank account first by making a small sepa payment in order to add funds
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:41:37
My total savings are indeed that much and i agree with you,but even if im going to invest less than 5k, im worried about the hard fork which i dont know exactly what it means, care to explain?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:18:16
Thanks for the info,ill check it as soon as i go home and have time,So you're telling me there will always be a fee to pay no matter what,and i can only minimize it as much as i can right? But beside local traders,if i want to buy a full bitcoin (5600$)lets day from from coinbase, and transfer it to any wallet,electrum or a hardware one,how much of it will it be left in the end after fees,is it worth?
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:19:39
by following i mean that i didnt knew much about it back then in order to invest,wasnt even thinking of it,the thing is that, by the time i invest on it, for me, it means automatically that my money are "gone" because im not planning on selling it even if the price drops, im thinking of it as a long term investment where i will sell it only if it reaches an astronomical price, even if years go by and it doesnt, i might just sell it to the price its going to be,but my thought right now is either buying a full bitcoin,or none at all, must think of it a lot..
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:25:09
so i should choose segwit?
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:59:32
so i shouldnt have fear of buying from there? also are there any fees? and if i buy from there, do you think ill have the bitcoin before october 25?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:15:36
i live in greece, and coinbase asks me to send money to an adress in estonia, the thing is i dont know what sepa is and how i send it to that adress they want
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:33:40
can you give me some more explanation on step 2? also, say that i have 10 bitcoins and i decide to sell them and get either cash or directly deposited to my bank account,besides of losing anonymity,how can that money be legal? Wont there be any tax? Or the bank asking me where you found that money?
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:50:43
Oh man.. would you believe if i told you i live each day by that moto?? "Always prepare for the worst that way there wont be any suprises" and i think of it the same for buying btc
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:37:06
Thats what im afraid of...another option i thought is making multiple accounts at exchanges and buy with credit card limits..
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:31:53
do they have a limit on credit card buys? i need to buy a large sum, like a full bitcoin before october 25
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:01:28
here we go again? wow sorry for wasting your precious time from the vision that comes from your eyes, ok? perhaps you should/could have ignored this post, but noooo...
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:42:22
thanks a lot mate!! one more question,ive stumbled uppon a post that said coinbase removed the 3-5 day waiting period to deposit funds, is that true? cause i want to buy before october 25, do you think ill manage?
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:06:01
From my research and understanding (correct me if im wrong people who know more about this) is that, when the fork is going to happen, a new version of bitcoin will be created (bitcoin gold) that is going to cost less than bitcoin, for example, if bitcoin now costs 5.600$ after the fork it might cost lets say 4.000$ and bitcoin gold will cost 1.600$ (take this as an example these prices are completely random) so if you have some bitcoins, automatically you will also have some bitcoin gold a.k.a free coins,this is happening because bitcoin is now completely mined using asic miners and not GPUS, but bitcoin gold will be mined exclusively using GPUS or something like that, im not the best person to explain this but, something like that!
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:36:13
the thing is i've been reading articles regarding the fork that it has already happened,is that true?
