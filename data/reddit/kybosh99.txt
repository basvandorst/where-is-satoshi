You'd probably end up with articles that recount the entire history of bitcoin, the internet &amp; everything before getting to the point.

We have other deductions in addition to income tax, but it'd be hard to lose 60%. 
Have a play around with the [UK tax calculator](

Robert Peston is super negative about *everything*! 
On the whole I didn't think it was too bad a feature. They at least got it right that it was Mt.Gox, not Bitcoin and that other exchanges had distanced themselves from it. 
They also acknowledged that it could become a real threat to the banks "…to the banks as Amazon has been to the high street…" and they kept the regulation speak to a minimum. And not a mention of the word "ponzi".
Edit: The actual [video]( is online now.

What about ipv6 support? This seems to a weak spot with most ISPs.

Have you considered adapting it so it can be used with another exchange?

Is MtGox a financial service in the eyes of US Law?

I think it'll drop quite a bit more in the next 24hrs. Most of Europe isn't even awake yet.

20% is the basic rate for U.K. income tax, though your first £10,000 isn't taxed. It's then 40% for higher earners. There used to be a 50% rate for super high earners but it was abolished by the Tory government.

It's actually a bit of a [tax haven](

Users don't seem to problems trusting SSL and I doubt many no the first thing about it - all they do is "look for the padlock". Most people don't understand how these things work. Most people don't really care. Their trust is based on the reputation (old credit cards were just a magnetic strip with a signature). 
Whether people would trust the network after a successful 51% attack would depend on the effects of such an attack. Today, most damage is self inflicted (lost wallets, lost passwords).
If governments want to kill it off they'll restrict the ability to convert their local currency into BTC in the first place. They could lean on Visa/Mastercard, lean on banks, complicate tax laws, spread FUD and just make it generally inconvenient to buy them.

It seems to depend who's selling. I got 0.1BTC for £25.85 at about 1pm today, (so about 1BTC=$413) which was after the news of the $400 barrier being broken. Prices have gone up since then so I'd wait for them to settle again. I didn't pay any other fees and transferred the BTC straight into my offline wallet.
BitBargain isn't an exchange so sellers are free to price how they like.

How much is the premium for buying through a broker vs buying through an exchange?

Wow, thanks!

They don't take a 30% cut from PayPal either but their payment app is still in the store. 
The 30% rule is only supposed to apply to content which is bought to be consumed within the app so I think they must be getting pulled for a different reason.

They would want receipts for the expenses (mining equipment, maybe electricity) and consider everything you couldn't prove as profit.

You absolutely need to talk to a lawyer about this (and probably the police) as soon as possible. 
There are multiple players here (you, localbitcoins, the buyer, their bank and your bank). You'll need an expert to show you who's liable.

Don't the Aussies already have similar internet filters? And for the US you need only google "tsa" to see what their freedom is being reduced to.

It's probably not the most financially astute decision but, in my experience, nothing beats that silky feeling of debt free living.

In the UK, at least, a lot of firms will give you 30 minutes for free along with cost projections, which can help you work out how much of a case you have and wether it's worth the risk to continue.

I used BitBargain.  
It seemed to be the most legit looking site and the seller prices seem to track closely with Mt.Gox. All went pretty smoothly considering it was my first purchase.
