Is the transaction speed fast enough for a Craigslist sale, though? With a high enough fee, you can get confirmation in an hour, but I wouldn't want to stick around as the buyer or the seller to wait for confirmations.

Prices aren't going up just because Apple can now take a cut of the credit card processing fees.

You're messing up your links. 50 bits @_date: 2014-06-03 05:21:30
That's cutting off your nose to spite your face. If you want BTC to gain traction, you'll want all users to be able to easily use BTC. Just because you might not agree with Apple's stance doesn't mean you should prevent Apple users from discovering or embracing BTC.

I found where you can use their offline address generator, but I can't find where to create the private key QR code to scan it into the app. I must be blind.

Costco accepts only Amex. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:47:47
I don't know what you're using, but in the times when I've not paid in full, I get a rollover balance and an interest charge on the balance.
If not, please explain what the Amex credit card in my wallet really is.

That's trickle-down economics you're thinking about. Most retailers already do not provide discounts when taking cash, so it's too idealistic to expect the same with a BTC transaction.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:49:15
It seems that the processing fees are just split between buyer and seller in the BTC scenario.
Along those lines, BTC supporters who argue that sellers would lower prices forget that a large amount of sellers do not offer discounts with cash payments. There would be no incentive to provide discounts to something that still has a fee.
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:23:22
The millions of people who shop on/with those sites certainly do.
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:34:26
Vendors do not pass the savings to customers in the way you think. Target does not give a cash discount. Gyft is not related to Target even thought Gyft sells GCs. You're not spending Bitcoin at Target, you're spending a gift card.
Also, Venmo does not charge fees when using a bank account, only when funding with a credit card. While you may choose the path that includes fees, I do not.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:50:59
That makes the cc fees even lower in comparison to sales across all payment methods.

I gambled with a small portion of my BTC. It was fun to gamble online again. I don't keep any BTC on the casino sites when I'm done so I have to consciously decide to play again.
