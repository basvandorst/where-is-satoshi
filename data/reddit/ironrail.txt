1) forgive my ignorance: where/what exactly is bitcoin? Is it wrong to say there really is no 'object', that btc is just a net positive value recorded on the blockchain ledger , and the owner of btc is someone who has the private key to an address that is on the ledger with a positive balance?
2) If that is the case, then why do people have wallets if all you need is somewhere to have those public address/private key combination of letters/numbers? What is the benefit for the user? Doesn'tthat place a lot of undue trust in the 3rd party maker of the wallet?
3) What is the deal with aml/kyc? Isn't that the exact opposite and  antithesis  of 'crypto'? Is there any way to enter this space if you are unwilling to post all of your information online? 
4) how do you keep from reusing addresses?  Doesn't it cost every time you move btc from one address to another, even if from one address you own to another address? Can you explain the concept of multiple public addresses for one private key? 
Thank you

hey, i'm new to the game too and also use coinbase ... and I think I wanna move it into cold storage (?) to better protect it (that's a thing, right?). 
So tell me if this sounds right: I go to bitaddress.org (or a site like that), generate a public and private key, write all that down and then transfer my bitcoins from coinbase to that newly generated public address. 
If that's what you do, then I guess I'm confused about where the coins "go" . Do they exist anywhere, or is it that my private key unlocks something in the ledger/blockchain? Thanks in advance!
