I m all fine with Bitcoin having a small blocksize. But please do not pretend to be a medium of exchange or a crypto reserve currency then. It is costing a lot of people a lot money being forced to use Bitcoin for payments. This money goes into the pocket of miners (mainly) and exchanges.

no, these are high volume exchanges. And so far the value has converged rather to the Korean prices.

Keep the blocks small, get out of payments and everybody is happy. Bitcoiners have digital gold and everyone else is not forced to pay these skyhigh fees for transacting with digital gold.

transaction volume is up 5 fold in 3 months, merchant adoption will come with bitpay. But please be blind and assume people will continue to pay those huge fees for "safety"

dogecoin is less liquid than Bitcoin Cash and has a smaller network. So in half a year, what do you think the relation of Bitcoin Cash to Dogecoin transactions will look like? I d guess the over/under is 10-1. Transaction volume on the Bitcoin Cash chain is rising quickly and this will increase given the congestion on BTC/Ethereum.
the risk of a Bitcoin Cash not reaching its destination is basically 0. With BTC you have an automatic loss of 1% for all but huge transactions. Whatever competitor there is has to be pretty darn insecure to compensate for this.

in a lot of cases Bitcoin is the only option (gambling, exchanges). It would make much more sense to use Litecon or Bitcoin Cash there. A reserve currency has to have low fees, so I hope all these BTC exchange pairs will be replaced until BTC offers cheap transactions.

would that not imply a channel would have to be opened on both sides? Is it really realistic to settle very rarely on the network given people could try to steal funds on LN?
I mean i get that scammers are supposed to be punished by losing their funds, but what if they have already payed with them?
