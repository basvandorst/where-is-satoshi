Technology/access to information is a beautiful/scary thing. It can connect us for good or evil.

Guys it worked. MY turn

Exactly. It is always the convenience of being out and spontaneously wanting to go somewhere, or to an event etc. I shouldn't get punished 20% of the time I want to use an ATM for convenience. Exchanges are fine, but they have their issues. It's not always super quick. Sometimes there are delays. Sometime they freeze accounts. Sometimes they send your information to banking companies and they shut you down. It's unfortunate now cause I'll just stick to an exchange and then what, get my account shut down for banking with crypto. There's always someone trying to rob you, sometimes it's a guy in a suit and not some dude with a fucking knife.

When will there be better security at ATMs??? This is now the third time where I have been held up, and this time I lost over 4500$!! Not to mention the times the ATM delays the transaction and you are left wondering when you are going to see the transaction. Sorry, just frustrating that these guys seemingly just hang out near ATMs and wait. Ruined Saturday night.

Thanks for response. I use all mediums to buy/sell/enjoy crypto. It's sad that we need to qualify one way as safer. I had used other ATMs no problem a few times before this, but seemingly this is always an end result that could happen. I'm finito with these things.

Shouldn't be waiting too long. Just keep the mofo there for the entire time. Better make sure he send a decent miners fee or you too are going to be eating dinner together
