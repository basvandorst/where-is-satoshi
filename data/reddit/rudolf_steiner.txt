dont think so. according to that logic, everyone who went long, must have been interested in increasing prices, ergo pump the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:08:29
and the ones who bet on climbing prices will make money if the price went up!

there you have it! guns are not used as contemporary methods for protection against tyrannical governments. they are usually used by governments against other governments, by gangs, by phycho school/college kids or hunters. if i wanted to protect myself against arbitrarily acting governments, i would invest my money in a good lawyer. this why we have a constitutional state/rule of law. guns are superfluous in modern days, just like slavery was/is.

no, i dont pay attention to orderbooks. we will see, if it's positive, but i would be cautious/def. not by above the set price.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:19:43
it's called spoofing...
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:18:33
in terms of daytrading, i can imagine that orderbooks are helpful, but in terms of weeks/months it doesnt matter. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:16:48
i was born in a totalitarian state and we had a non-violent revolution. why? because there were no guns to use. guns are def. not the great equalizer. you cant fight fire with fire. check the statistics of other countries with very tight gun control - it's worth a thought. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:05:15
when were guns successfully used for protection against tyrannical governments?

prev.high would be 1200$-1300$ (nov./dec. 2013). so lets see, how far this drop goes;)
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:28:29
 try this explorer. bc1 adr. are bech32 adr. what adr. did you send it from?
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:29:12
did you locate the file somewhere else? i assume, the 'wallet-generation-process' starts all over, if there's no '.dat'-file in the wallet folder within the app data. might be wrong though - just a guess.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:32:33
yes...in the beginning core asks you to create a new wallet, or to use an existing.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:35:26
you can create p2sh adr. (beginning with a 3) with electrum, but those adr. wont reduce the size of a transaction like bech32 adr. would do. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:40:53
i would suggest to rename both (just to not get confused), copy them and see on which wallet the funds are.
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:30:08
remove password!
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:33:58
wenn, since you know, how to generate p2sh adr., ypu should be able to evaluate on your own;)
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:52:36
i think, it never dropped below its previous high...

@_date: 2018-02-05 17:21:24
the wallet you open must have been another one you created. i rename every wallet.dat, so i dont get confused. look into the other wallet, might be in there. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:07:23
there would be not bitcoin without taxation!
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:17:57
do you have access to you very first (funded) 'wallet.dat'?
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:51:04
so did the funds arrive? i never tried sending from a conventional adr. (starting with 1) to a bech32 adr. (starting with bc1).
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:24:28
you didnt give an answer, just (prob. false) accusations which ridicule op.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:10:50
paying taxes might be the best thing.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:46:12
yes there is imo. txn will be aprox. 1/3 smaller ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:32:08
no society does not. meaning, if you dont pay taxes, other members of society (who pay taxes) will put you in prison! but anyway, whats wrong paying taxes? i dont get it. everyone uses infrastructure, financed by taxes - hospitals, schools, public transportation, health care, food, pension, wellfare. if you dont want to pay taxes, fine, get out and never come back using societies' shit!
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:51:54

ver spoke about 70%-80%, repeating his arguments over and over. it didnt seem passionate - it made the impression, that he is obsessed with the whole bcash vs. 'bitcoincore' thing.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:34:46
its not about the government or 'the provider'. its about your basic needs like food, water, sleep, air, security, a house/home, etc. you cant live without them - you force yourself to meet your needs.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:14:03
security is a basic need, every human being longs for. you are not forced to pay taxes, you force yourself!

here in germany we have a so called social market economy. everybody distributes, everybody benefits, the state supervises and arranges the funds (statutory health, unemployment, pension, nursing care and casualty insurance) - works very well. nobody has to live in poverty. when lifes depend on private companies, whose only goal is to make profit, things will def. go wrong (education, health care, infrastructure, military, etc.) i was born in the former gdr (east germany) - didnt work, not because of its socialist form of government, but because of its totalitarian, suppressive and authoritarian character. national socialism is a form of socialism in which a social group thinks it's superior towards the others. it is only social within its own ranks - this has actually nothing to do with the initial socialism meant by marx and engels. please, get educated...oh, wait.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:03:41

until last year, illegal immigrants have been of great use for us citizens, taking out the garbage, cleaning up the shit, doing the work, an average white american wouldnt even do when pointing a gun at his/her head. comparison to obamas immigration policy in 2011 is not letitimate. trumps ban is way broader. obama reacted to specific threats. supporting your allies with guns, right! it's a 'deal', not a humanitarian service. those guns kill. i understand the historical grown relationship between an american and his gun. but thats outdated. as you said, you have laws, people have to obey. you are not a frontier, traveling through uncharted land in 1685, its 2017. obamacare, again i understand the historical grown pride an american being an individual. but think of the people who are being helped, not of your premium raised by 10% - be grateful;) what about a kid, who was born sick and because of that being rejected by every insurance company. its not always about a 'good deal'! please dont call me an idiot - gives deep insights regarding your character, and those insights are not positive and certainly not grateful.

oh right, building a wall on the southern border is very grateful. muslim ban, very nice of the us. selling military equipment worth trillions, will def. make the world a better place. cutting off obama care, what an altruisric move! starting wars without justification, thats what we need! should i continue?

the printing press with moveable type was invented in 1450. we all know what followed: reformation, enlightenment, industrialisation, etc. lets presume, the internet is an invention of similar meaning. where would you classify bitcoin within the analogy of historic events?

@_date: 2017-05-27 14:20:07
why are you hoping that? it would only harm bitcoin. it might be good for your profits, but thats very short minded.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:52:34
no, not at all. society is debating on the issue 'immigration'. it's a chance, in which everybody has the right to state its opinion, forming a compromise. ever heard of the term 'inclusion'? it's more like a challenge than a threat. ultimately we are to some extend responsible for this shit. and america should feel even more responsible for this mess. do you remember? - 'weapons of mass destrucion' it was your grateful country to start a war over there that resulted in the humanitarian crisis we have today. and now you have fucks like trump and bannon over there whose ideology, per definition, is very close to national socialism. altright, breitbart, kkk, alex jones and shit like that can be compared to göbbels, himmler, the ss/sa and so on. national ('america first') socialism ('the forgotten men and women, who will never be forgotten again'). you should educate yourself. read books on those subjects, that helps. you dont even know the difference between socialism and communism besides engels and marx. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:14:29
you are wrong. in most european countries social security, tax or other legislative obligations are way more effective than private charity as you named it.

haha...mornin'! what we might need, is a digital enlightenment in which every entity of society is involved. i wouldnt talk of giving people power, they shouldnt have. most people in charge are either elected, or went through institutional processes. that's, like it or not, legitimate. just have a look at trump. people need to get educated to pull themselves out of their self-inflicted immaturity;)

thanks! i just had a look at the abstract. so where should we be? making efforts to resist mass surveillance? hiding behind our cryptographic artificial identity? imho paranoia results in uncertainty and this again in the inability of society to unfold its potential.
