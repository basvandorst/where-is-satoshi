It will be a different address for each "extortion" that way they can keep track of whether it worked or not.
Just because there's nothing in this address doesn't mean it hasn't worked previously

Obviously I can't speak for the community, but this is what we want.
 People thinking, "you know what? Actually they may have started as a joke but they are a charitable, hardworking group that believe in what they are doing." 
Come join in, no one is trying to take anything away from any other coin and with a little bit of effort from different parties doing things in different directions we can all rise as a whole.

I'm not sure I follow, if it all goes in to one pot wouldn't you just see an address making a deposit which is obviously anonymous, you would have no idea who put what where? I don't see how you could know who actually paid you and who didn't.
This is me not understanding not me calling you out and saying you are wrong.

I've worked at scores of these in England. When you set up and break down your stand it's vitally important to put it up on the right way so you'll actually sell anything and disassemble it to avoid damage to your gear. I'd never ever let anyone on my stand that wasn't in my team. How would they know how you wanted it set up?
