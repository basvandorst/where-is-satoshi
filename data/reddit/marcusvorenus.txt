I support Plan A, except I would replace "bit" with "space buck".

Why would they care? It's not like that money is actually leaving China and disappearing, it's just being transferred from BTC buyers to BTC sellers (who presumably want the yuan in order to buy chinese products, services and property instead of using it as fuel for a bonfire).

Tell them that if you do lose your money you will learn a great lesson which will more than make up for the money lost, and that you'll probably spend your dollars in video games and junk food anyway if you can't buy BTC, so it's a win-win situation.

So what? I'm not asking you to become friends with them. I'm sure you can understand why it would be better to elect a useful "fucktard" than a burdensome one.

Ok thanks.

The limit on the number of transactions per block is not a hard limit. It was "soft-coded" into the clients to avoid spam transactions making the blockchain too big. We can just increase the limit if the transactions per block start hitting the limit.
As for your other question, if there are more transactions per day than currently allowed, those transactions that were excluded will be included in a future block, maybe the next day or the day after that.

He's only asking why Sign Guy said one thing and then did another thing.

If they are supportive of virtual currencies then why not? Better to elect them than some dinosaur who is hostile towards them.

Yeah, I got that. I hadn't realized the seed was all you needed. I don't think Electrum and Trezor explain that well enough. My understanding was that you needed both the seed and encryption password to steal the coins from a wallet.

We have been able to buy BTC with credit card and Paypal through Virwox since April 2011 and they haven't shut them down yet.

There could be a banner placed at the top for a while explaining the switch.
