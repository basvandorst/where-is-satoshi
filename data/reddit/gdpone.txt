lol @ stating trump is trying to ban an ENTIRE religion.  He advocated temporarily stopping REFUGEES from entering and living here until they can be properly screened.  How is that anything but sane rationale to durkas going muhammad jihad?

What 'problem' is that?  The made up one by modern day feminists?  Forced participation through social engineering is not equality, its control.

Also posting this here that I am posting in the comments of the blog in case its removed ...
There are many ways I am thinking about how I want to frame what I have to say and how I want to get my point across. One thing that popped into mind was how these ‘safe spaces’ are almost how a virus will inject itself into a living host to attempt to alter it for its own benefit and will at the expense of the host. After all nothing says segregated like doing it to yourself of your own free will.
I believe your intentions are good. And I dont even particularly care/mind you are separating yourselves from the larger bitcoin community at large. I could see how its less intimidating for woman to have a support group full of woman.
What I abhor and cannot tolerate is the inference its mens fault. Do you know what you call generalizing and placing blame on a group of people merely for a certain trait they posses? Bigotry! Or in this particular case, sexism. Even Racism given your quote about bitcoin being ‘dominated’ by mostly WHITE males. As if that is some sort of problem or issue that NEEDS to be SOLVED.
Because nothing screams equality like using sexism against men to solve the issue of your perceived sexism or discrimination against woman.

Just received mine last week and so far have had none of these issues with my galaxy s6.  I also use mycelium.  Actually had not yet tried sending from ledger and first time I just tried it did have an I/O error.  Second time no issue once I set the phone down on top of the card on a desk.

Seems to me thats the beauty of this from what little ive read.  You can sell whatever you want.  New, used, something in between.

The problem with modern day feminism is it relies on self reinforcing feedback from themselves in their fantasy land.  In the article she states how she has only ever been treated nicely in male dominant meetups, then posts the feminist self reinforced line which is from the linked article:
"But the problem is the public perception of Bitcoin as a “plaything for white, tech-savvy men”
The ONLY people with this perception or even have a thought about it are feminists.
If woman, men, dinosours, or whatever want to get into bitcoin there is literally NOTHING stopping them from doing so.
Then there is lines like this "Who, exactly, is dropping the ball here? Men, who comprise more than 90 percent of Bitcoin’s users, surely."  
How is this not sexist?  Blaming men for merely existing and participating in something we like or believe in?
"How do you fix this problem? It’s about numbers. You need new blood."
So then we have this line basically describing going to war over men enjoying a certain thing merely for being men enjoying that thing.   In this case bitcoin.
GG Feminists.

Because theyre being dicks.  Creating miners, mining with them, selling them as new even though theyre used.  And they dont sell them until its unprofitable or barely.  Its market manipulation just like they do with their own currency to stay on top.
@_date: 2016-04-07 14:54:38
Because this is supposed to be a decentralized system.  Not China BTC.  And because I am interested in mining.

lol you must own a website/blog/'news' site.  If you want to make money from a website, get a real job and sell something of value to others through that website.  Your rehashed and republished text vomit is not worth annoying me with ads.

This pisses me off so much.  Something needs to be done.

I love how 'underrepresented' implies as if there is hordes of woman wanting/needing to be represented in something they likely have no care about.

If it doesn't have to be fair to me then it doesn't have to be fair to China then either.  Block them out.  These chinese companies are double dipping and manipulating the market.  They cant or dont seem to want to play fair so why should anyone else?
@_date: 2016-04-07 13:49:37
Honestly china should be blocked out from the blockchain.

Assuming the seller actually sends what you bought?  What does this system provide in the way or protection against fraud?  Genuine question I have not seen anything on that yet.
