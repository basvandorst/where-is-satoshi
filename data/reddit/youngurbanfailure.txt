I wouldn't use a service like [Escrow My Bits]( to act as an escrow that would only release the money when I give the ok?

I contacted the person and said that is what I'd like to do. I'll see what their response is. Thanks.

Hi, I am a total newbie to cryptocurrencies, but someone who would like to sell me something over the internet wants me to pay in bitcoin. Is there a way to purchase something with bitcoin, but either not have the money released until I receive the item as advertised or force a refund if the product is not satisfactory? Thanks.

I think you are right for this particular purchase, but even for future purchases I would still like to attempt to protect myself as much as I possibly can.

Hmm, I'm looking at bitrated right now. Do you have any knowledge of its services and reputation? 
@_date: 2018-06-19 12:35:36
Yes. I believe I am. If not for this particular purchase because I am getting the vibe the person is a scammer, but for any other future purchases I'd like to protect myself as much as possible. Google seems to be telling me an escrow wallet is the safest. Any advice on that?

I am thinking that as well, but I am seeing on Google that there does seem to be bitcoin escrow wallets, so that could possibly be a safety measure. I'm just a bit confused on how anyone buys anything on a dnm other than just by crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.
