Hey! I'm thinking of getting into BTC kind of unwillingly. You see; I might have to receive BTC for payment over fiat. Normally I wouldn't do this; but I've been following BTC for awhile and am interested. Due to all the exchanges drama; what's the best way to start a BTC wallet and receive funds?

I want to invest stuff ASAP though.

How bad of a fee to transfer to LTC and then sell?

Thanks for the reply.
I'm talking in the hundreds; 100-300 for now but I want to put more in over time.

Does coinbase charge fees for transferring to alt coins?
What about selling LTC? Are there fees for that?

My bank denied it; see why I need to verify ID

I already have $40 in a USD wallet and $30 in btc/eth combined in Coinbase.

I'm having some issues with Coinbase. I've tried submitting my ID over 7 times now with perfect clarity, however I'm denied every time. I need to do so to use PayPal and buy more BTC at this dip ;/ . Any ideas?

Unimportant, it is a recognized ID by Coinbase.
