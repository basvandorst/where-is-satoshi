No we did use the Casascius Escrow Scheme in version 1.0, have you ever seen or used bitescrow.org?,  the first version of the site was based on the source code thats open sourced albeit in a easier to use UI. 


Yes we do control the server private key but it also allows us to refund transactions when they are in a mediation/dispute phase. We've actually been able to refund some clients who have dealt with a scammer and we were able to reverse the transaction because of this.


Your right in the traditional sense but wrong in the present tense, it's all written in NodeJS which is server side javascript. 


Nope we'll be around for quite sometime we see bitcoin as changing the world, and we would like to very much be a part of this exciting time in history. 
Now the only thing I can confidently say that you are right in is that we can be more transparent in regards to how funds are handled absolutely, but it was done as a way of mitigating attacks on the server by NOT saying .... "hey Mr. Hacker we keep a hot wallet ready for the taking on our server, why don't you repeatedly try to break into our server until your successful". But as I mentioned above we have never scammed anyone and have honestly refunded more clients who would have lost the money otherwise. 
While we are working on the next version of the site that will utilize multi-sig/P2SH transactions, that would not allow us to ever be in control of the funds yet making it easy for the average internet user is something that we are currently working through. 
If anyone here is interested in helping us beta test that would be great, as we would like to have as many trusted eyes on the project.
