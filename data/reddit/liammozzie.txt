10 years ago almost anyone with a pc could mine, now only those who invest thousands into miners can.
Tell me how's that diffrent from any other currency? Instead of bankers controlling the market you just have huge mining farms controlling it. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:18:51
I don't understand why you would sell them in the fist place. Wouldn't it be more profitable to make and keep them, then use them to mine yourself?
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:39:11
That's not going to accomplish anything. They are a private business and can do what ever the fuck they like. You want change then vote with your wallet, stop using them their are other exchanges you can use instead. 
Signing a petition is the same as praying, it gets you no where but at least you felt like you did something.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:31:20
Hahahahaha iPhone robbed everything about the iPhone that makes it unique 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:17:36
Why? You make way more money scalping.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:40:45
Which is the point I made nothing has changed.
The rich few continue getting rich and no one else gets a look in unless you buy buy bitcoin off them making them even richer. 
There's no difference between bitcoin and any other currency, where it matters now. Except it's easier to spend and move flat about.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:05:54
You can make more money in month scalping than you would hoping bitcoin goes up 1000% in a year or two. With the same amount of risk there abouts.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:12:12
I'm using nicehash to get coins then transferring them to coinbase and sell them. 
Am I doing it wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:30:07
Sub 12k 
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:51:10
I probably have. 
I'm more worried about security than privacy if I'm totally honest. If bitcoin was as secure and fast as say visa with the same level of privacy I wouldn't mind. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:27:36
No I buy on the lows too just not when it's in free fall. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:05:40
Because petitions are stupid. You might as well said let's make coinbase change one upvote = one prayer.
Raise all the awareness you want point out coinbases flaws get people to use a diffrent provider, that will make a difference, but the partitions are pointless and only serve patting your self on the back for doing nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:32:11
I have zero trust in any coin at the moment. I rent out my hash get paid in BTC and sell it the moment I get it for flat. 
Again you seem to be convincing yourself more than me.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:30:33
Yeah unless the fees are 0 don't expect mainstream acceptance of bitcoin, it's as simple as that.
Every time you buy something or pay a bill you have to give a middle man money. Good luck selling that idea haha
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:58:09
Ok if you do it over all time one has long periods of stability with mostly upward growth. While the other has been all over the place since 2017.
Before 2017 I had no problems with bitcoin since 2017 I've lost all faith in it, it can't keep it's pace and it's going to drop like a Rock in the next few months
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:51:41
Read what I wrote again. It's a joke 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:41:15
So visa for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:20:26
I started with £5 a week later I have £20. Yup I'm broker than a motherfucker and thats all I could afford.
I made 3000% on my original investment in 3 weeks just dicking about.
If that was £500 I'd have £2000 now and if it was £5000 I'd be sitting on £20,000 not bad for dicking about for 3 weeks. In your case it would have been $60,000.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:55:48
Look you have two options, use a diffrent provider or make your own.
Partitions don't do shit when it comes to private companies 
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:08:04
Difference is for every flat there is a country where it is valid for everything and when your not in that country you can use your debit card with only your native flat in and buy without hassle or go to any exchange and exchange your currency for theirs.
Tell me how many hoops do I have to jump though to exchange bitcoin into pounds.
They are no where near the same.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:28:51
That only works if someone wants to buy them. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:03:44
It's a profit and if the price goes up again it's worth it
Also that's total household costs not just my pc
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:31:31
If you are serious about crypto replacing flat then fees have to go and Every transaction has to be instant.
I don't see either of the above ever happening. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:29:32
So what happenes if 2/3rds of the hashing power goes away tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:50:55
Oh you poor bastard. I hope to god that not true
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:33:51
I use nicehash to sell hash and cash out into flat soon as I get It, just to make a bit of extra money on the side while it lasts. Don't expect to get rich but free money is free money while it lasts.
What category does that put me in?
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:34:36
Until it doesn't like now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:31:48
Boycott them all you like, It's out of their hands. The EU makes the rules not visa, good luck changing anything within the EU if you're not a EU citizens, they couldn't give a shit what you think.

But anyone can run a node how can they /s
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:41:05
Yep just wait and see 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:59:18
I'm on my phone so can only see it in pounds atm it's lost 1k in value in 1 day. In the last month it's lost 5k and only went back up to 10k because of alt coin pump and dumps with sharp drops after each one. I'm not expecting it to stay above 10k for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:36:43
10 hours from now its going be at 12k
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:08:35
I don't care what the currency is tbh. As long as it holds its value and is easy to spend I don't care what it is.
Cryptocurrency is nether of those things and unless it becomes both it will never replace flat and all the dreams people have crypto will just stay dreams
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:59:06
Ok where do I send my kids to school? Who's collecting my rubbish? Who's maintaining the roads so I can get to work and drop the kids off at school? Where do I go if I need medical attention? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:05:04
The bankers and investors don't want it though. If it works then 90% of the finance industry just got automated. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:44:55
The real rich ones are the people who mined 100+ coins in the first 4 years.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:24:21
I don't get that what makes them core devlopers? What gives them the right to choose what direction bitcoin goes in? Sounds kinds centralised with people governing over the direction bitcoin heads in.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:50:34
Again but in English for a friend
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:12:01
No I never, that litteraly how currency came into existence 
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:39:54
True but there's going to be a lull while they move their equipment.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:27:29
I love the comments on that post people saying stuff like "he should have just (turns into an eppisode of star trek talking about how the dilithium matrix is Turing into a singularity deflecting of the antimatter chamber causing a quantum flux in the warp core) and he would have been fine"
Yet people wonder why crypto struggles to go mainstream.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:14:22
Nothing's really moved over the last 3 days
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:47:33
Because people are still using their service and have seen no drop in profits. Your petition doesn't mean shit, want them to change then vote with Your wallet.
Go look at any business that's done a 180 on something, all the petitions in the world don't change shit it's only when their profits go down do they make change.
What are you still in uni and think the world will get better if we all believe really really hard. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:22:27
Turns out making a global currency isn't that easy and some governing body regulating it and choosing What direction it goes in, helps after all.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:53:10
The funny thing is it's not even about them not wanting to. It's because of the Visa European payment network.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:46:51
Yeah they can that's how BCH was born. Was you asked which way it should go or was it left upto a certain few? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:03:39
Just use nicehash
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:37:10
So instead of being in a pool making it cheaper for everyone. You suggest going solo and paying on my own?
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:11:27
Surprised Google hasn't jumped on that then.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:32:03
You on drugs?
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:16:08
I used coinbase. Gave them my email, phone number, passport pic and bank card details to get verified. 
Was able to buy btc within 20min of opening the account. I'm in the uk
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:48:19
There's the flaw, that's not how currency should work. Imagine that happening with the pound. I try to buy something in the shop and the shopkeeper says to me if you want to buy with pounds you will have to wait a week for the till to open or you could go to the exchange next door and change it to dollars and then the till will open today.
It's not feasible and it's a out right stupid system. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:31:06
I've been mining for 3 days using my gaming rig. I've made £6 total electric used in my house is £4 so you can profit from just using 1 gtx 1070

Capital if you trade and income tax if you mine
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:09:01
Set up a node and do the low ones?
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:08:52
I dunno what that is sorry.
Wait for a drop that looks like its going to go back up buy bitcoin, then when it goes back up sell it again. I never hold on to bitcoin for more than 10min.
If that's futures then yeah. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:14:53
When it hits ten things will get fun on here
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:15:58
It's only your bitcoin if you out and back into your wallet Every time you want to invest it. 
Unless your paying stupidly high fees or waiting weeks anytime you want to do something with your bitcoin, it's not yours. Gotya 
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:42:57
Yup, Google can track me all they like for all the free products they give me and the ease of access to them. Sell my info to advertisers who I block, what do I care.

Get googles deep mind to watch the stock markets for a few years and teach it the basics. 
That should figure out how to work the system

I put unemployed then it asked for previous so I put unemployed and no one 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:35:40
There may be fewer miners but the mining power to day far outstrips what it was back then so whats the diffrence?
What's the difference between 1000 miners with a total hash of 10TH and 50miners with a total hash of 10TH? Just used smaller numbers for simplicity 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:06:29
If you are mining does it really matter when you start?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:11:33
Because 3 months from now the price of bitcoin will be around £4-6k and like the last crash of that magnitude in a market there will be lotso jumping out of Windows. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:41:35
Yup and 3 months from now I'll be rolling in my flat laughing while you sit at your screen crying looking at bitcoin worth £6k
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:20:40

I did say major currencies. I'm not splitting hairs. That's currency in its basic form I can't be arsed lugging my cow the market, then trying to find a carpenter who needs a cow, to make me a chair. So I'll give him this token instead which will get him a cow when ever he wants one.
You can't do that with bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for that matter.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:08:15
Let's see can bitcoin collect data on millions of users, use that data to send targeted ads, Making profits for Facebook and multiple businesses around world? Nope.
Objectively speaking Facebook is better when it comes to value for money invested.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:28:41
It's dead it just doesn't know it yet. Put it this way the price is going to see $9k sooner than it's ever going to see$19k Again.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:20:23
Well stealing millions of dollars worth of something usually causes a crash not an uplift. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:08:03
At the moment I wouldn't buy any coin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:37:05
Depends on what you mean buy good money. For me good money is money I can spend in a shop when I need it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:10:32
Not to be that guy but you just invested £200 while btc is dropping like a rock.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:59:36
You do know you have to withdraw first. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:03:19
Only 2k away from what I said and I still have 2 and a half months to go.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:38:53
Not as long as I hold the private key to my wallet it won't. You ain't getting none of my coins. Go mine your own
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:33:44

Well I'm keeping hold of 1 btc just in case
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:34:07
90% of the time to try make a quick buck.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:37:54
What it's currently trading at isn't as important as how well it's holding it's value.
Bitcoin can't hold it's own piss at the moment, while cash is rolling along nicely. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:49:10
I'm talking about forcing them to finish up what they started before moving on half finished to something more profitable.

Beanie baby's. I'll leave it at that
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:13:10
All major flat currency fits that description.
Even though I have pounds in my bank account I can easily buy things in other currencies and usually with 0 fees. 
It doesn't matter where I am in the world I know I'll be able to spend my pounds on anything from a chocolate bar to a house. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:47:54
Then say bye bye to things Like, police, fire, ambulance, roads, schools, rubbish pick up and so forth
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:39:27
Yep so can i from those who invested their life savings into btc.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:39:45
See you in 3 month bud
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:40:56
That's the same as me not sticking my life savings in a normal bank account. For ease of access for day to day spending, Google might be a good idea. Like google bitpay where everything is internal so payments would be instant with little to no fee. 
If bitcoin is going to be mainstream something like that needs to be done anyway since even with lightning there's still going to be a delay.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:29:38

The cost is the only thing stopping it deep mind has cost just under half a billion to develop.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:03:01
Yup. For it to double it needs to be 1000% higher than your original investment.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:27:28
Until they figure out how to not have to wait a week to do a monthly shop with bitcoin no one should be wanting their wages in bitcoin.

If it goes back up to £15k for my next pay out I'll be happy 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:55:00
What about the backlog of old transactions not new ones.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:29:58
Then there should be a time stamp I don't understand why one isn't there anyway. 
Honestly it doesn't look like any of this was thought though very well at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:48:59
Point to where I said that? 
I'm complaint that trying to use it is shit. There's a diffrence
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:00:36
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:14:44
So they aren't bitcoin in my wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:54:46
Does that $1 get you shares or are you asking us to pay to help them make millions with 0 risk of their own capital.
Sometimes the stuff I see on here makes look like a bunch of gullible mugs.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:25:08
Who you trying to convince you or me? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:28:31
Best get a knife and fork ready
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:43:10
So bitcoin isn't the decentralised currency it claims to be
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:05:12
Lol that's naughty
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:28:19
That is the whole chart
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:42:55
Thanks for the explanation 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:18:07
Why are you getting upset set over basic facts about how currency works?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:25:50
Soon as i get any I cash out. Usually every 3 days I get 0.0012. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:24:36
And this is why crypto will never be taken seriously. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:58:16
The regular queue is the fairer system when it comes to currency. Have we learned nothing from history when we allow the few to have the upper hand in a system? 
Say crypto replaced flat today, you have just gave more power to the 1% than they ever had through banks.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:17:08
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:11:34
How much damage can you do with $200? That's more than enough to rent a van to go on a rampage. You can also buy enough peroxide to make explosives with that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:54:15
So increasing 100 by 10010.1% is 200?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:13:21
Neither of those option sound good tbh. 
It's the biggest major flaw of crypto. Charging people to spend their money is fucking retarded beyond measure.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:49:22
Change your bitcoin to a cryptic that's on the rise and has low fees. Then send it that way. The way bitcoin is dropping it's not like your going to lose money
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:44:56
I'm not sure it's good at spotting trends in a system, but the way markets can flux would mean it needs a huge sample to work from. 
If all the market details are saved somewhere and it can trawl though them plus feed it all the news regarding stocks, companies, people and what not over that same time period, it should be able to correlate key words in the news with what's happened in the markets at that time to come up with assumption on how the market will react. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:27:59
Then why is nearly every major exchange ignoring segwit? And why is BCH a he'll of a lot less volatile than bitcoin?  
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:49:32
Do you not see the flaw in that system when you want bitcoin to be a viable currency?
Sorry but you're going to have to wait a week to do some shopping or pay a bill because the rich buying expensive stuff is more important. 
This way of doing things is going to be the downfall if cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:32:47
I said a month ago it's going to be £4k by April 
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:29:17
I was right!
