You ain't seen nothing yet hehe . Crashes just like this Dec 22nd if I remeber correctly which was Tuesday I bought into ether at 850 was 450 by the next day . Been many crashes before that . Pretty common occurrence . China and South Korea caused it this time .

Good man losses only become losses when you realize them. I had to unlearn my careful stock trading methology with crypto .

I wish you the best of luck I need it too . Everyone made tons last year . I finally started mining coins this year and of course since I started two major crashes scared the shit out of me haha

I appreciate that and I am very greatful for what I have.  I just wish I had not been screwed out of such a valuable opportunity to have some security for my family. I do the best I can and am going to school to make more money but the thought of having some protection and being able to take better care of my family is what  bothers me . Being forced to work a job I hate 6 days a week while attempting to learn computer programming so I can do something I enjoy and make more money and having almost no time with my family sucks. A 2 year degree taking 5 years because I'm a door to door lawn care salesmen 
each day feeling like a waste taking the bus to work when one coin was a car 1 was medical emergencies and 3 were hold for life not mention more i could  have brought just makes me feel sick lol . But again my story is more about the fact that even being so close and losing it do to Mt Gox scam still didn't make me bitter or angry at people like you who benefited . Instead I support the network running my pc as a node and mine as well because I believe blockchain is Importent for my kids future.

I'm just pissesd because I started am ach transfer to coin base 8 days ago for 3k . My bank sent the money the 2nd day . Yet in coinbase I'm still pending.  It's a scam cause now  I gotta do instant buy on all  three currencies . So they get there fees and an extra 3k

It's not the 500 bucks rather fact that it's worth over 50k now and probably eventually a million. And it's not just those 5 btc. Had I not had my coins stolen by a crooked company I would have stayed involved  and probably bought alot more .  But I only mentioned my story because of all the the people trash talking the long holders and wishing for them to fail.

I hear you but I wasn't actually planning to keep that  much in btc only like 1000 . Was planning to transfer 2k to binance to buy iota. Before I did this purchase I did a test instant purchase for 100 which btw as a new customer is my limit so I couldn't send 3k that way. It too almost 14 hours to even hit the blockchain with etherium and 6 hours with btc . So I kinda felt like why shou l instant  buy when it's gonna take so long to transfer funds anyway .  They are clearly having issues with the overwhelming demand.

Well i mean it in the sense that my generation most likely won't have social security or Medicare and we don't get pensions . All I got going is a crappy 401k. Would have been nice to have some btc.  I truly believe it will go to the moon .

My son is 4 im 35. I'm back in college learning computer programming .

I agree and I alluded to that in my post. I just miss being a bigger part of that by holding myself.  And obviously having some fiat would would have made my life easier so I could be more involved. Had I not had such a shitty experience early on im sure id have purchased  more and other crypto curriences as well. Now I just feel totally left out and financially it's difficult to get I involved . Some krypto kitties are worth more then my life savings lol . 
But the point of this post was  lost on most . It's not about my misfortune.  It's about all the negativity people who just heard about bit coin or don't believe in it have . And the fact that people should not  be so angry and resentful . The things people were saying on stocktwits last night were so hateful. You nerd money is worth 0. Timber. It's finally falling.   Blah blah blah . Just irritated me . So much hate yet I bet most of those people have done nothing to preserve net neutrality or get involved in things that matter or are changing the world .  I wanted to show that I had a real reason to be angry yet remain positive and supportive of the community because it is much more important then making fiat.

I'm not doing it to make bitcoin . I'm doing it to help support the network.  Being able to make money on it is to risky at this point. I either put my entire bank account in for less than one coin or I buy 1 or 2k and if it doubles I make a grand or two . Risk isn't worth reward any more.

Most charities are complete scams . You could change peoples lives with one bitcoin each.  Hell half of one.

I agree on all points . Now that my money is here tho to day trade definetly  makes more sense to instant transfer money to gdax owned by gpu base form use wallet.  .035% fee for market 0 for limit orders.  There is no day tr ade limit like stocks either this is nuts with a I was doing it earlier . I watched bitcoi nnswing from 1440 last night to 17k in 3 minutes.
