No, it's not. But taking a look at the closest analogue - the rise of the internet and the dotcom bubble - there was no specific way to tell which company or what was going to succeed. Of course the ones who came out right will congratulate themselves as visionaries, but there were way too many moving parts for their choices to be meaningful beyond a few general good calls. 
More vision and less luck is involved in tech forecasts than trying to beat the market under standard conditions, but I think you're pruning too many contingencies in order to be able to tell a certain type of narrative. It's pretty well-understood that at least for choosing stocks, marketing new products, or running companies, natural talent only goes so far to ensure success. There's way too much out of the individual's control.


You're pushing this into absolutes where I'm not. I'm just saying more luck was involved than you seem to be accounting for, but I've made it clear twice that in certain respects, it's not luck but good analysis that puts someone in the right ballpark. But, yes, someone could have an excellent analysis and nonetheless get thrown a curveball. At that point the question is how they react and if their forecast model can withstand the new info.
As to the next bit, there are 7 billion people in the world, so a fair number of people having excellent streaks in this or that is hardly statistically surprising. That said, I didn't chalk it all up to luck, so, I don't know what you want from me here. It seems like, no offense, a bit of a butthurt rant.

Uh, what? This thread with you started by complaining that OP didn't say that Bitcoin achievement was indicative of general achievement, which was specifically what I originally criticized. Either different types of achievement are separate, or OP meant that you can only be an overachiever if you got into Bitcoin early. You can't have this both ways.


Where are you drawing this from? I never said anything remotely like this.


If you want to be really pedantic about this, then yes, you can access internet pretty much anywhere. However, in many areas it is not very fast because it is only accessible by satellite. Otherwise there would be no need for initiatives such as Project Loon. If your access speed is limited, the rate of information you will be able to digest is limited, so you will need to focus on prioritizing what you do with that time. An overachieving doctor would presumably prioritize medical research and communication with colleagues.
Either way, it doesn't change the broader point that a doctor dedicated to *doctoring*, which is presumably one of the requisites to being an overachiever in that field, will not necessarily be putting themselves in a position to be exposed to Bitcoin, internet or no, so on this point you're arguing just to argue.   
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:45:47
I meant like a doctor who was educated in a first world country and went into a remote region to work in the last few years, but either way - if the doctor's priority is on helping people and keeping abreast of medical research, it's still perfectly likely they wouldn't have heard of bitcoin until fairly recently. If internet is difficult to access and their priority when they have that access is to do research and communicate with family and colleagues, they may not even be going into the right areas to find out about Bitcoin in any detail.
Besides, now you're the one generalizing underachievement. Before you were specifying *Bitcoin* achievement, so how is the doctor's achievement *as a doctor* relevant?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:34:43
It's a big issue. It's disconcerting in here to see people calling it "FUD" or "liberal media agenda." Regardless of your position on climate change (though for a supposedly high-tech community like Bitcoin it's pretty unnerving to see anything like denialism being posted), the increasing energy expenditure isn't sustainable from the moon math lens. That means one of several things will happen:
1. Bitcoin's growth will be limited by energy availability (either by regulation or by market forces),
2. A different, "cleaner" crypto will take over (like a PoS-type project),
3. Some modification will be made to Bitcoin to make it operable at lower energy costs,
4. The introduction of renewables will progressively diminish the need for concern,
5. Some combination of the above.
The one thing we can be sure it *won't* be is "lol nbd nothing to worry about" 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:23:59


This is again confusing "right vision" with "right outcome." I agree that the rise of crypto could have been foreseen, just as the rise of the internet was.


This is ideology. You can look back over it and say how obvious it all was, but there were plenty of times where the future of Bitcoin was in doubt and a properly placed alternative could have moved in. These sorts of things cannot be predicted unless you're in a situation of control - and then it isn't prediction.


Sure, first mover advantage has made a huge difference for Bitcoin, I don't deny that. It doesn't change the fact that it wasn't possible to say with certainty that it *must* be Bitcoin - it just made the gamble safer.
Digital gold is a somewhat newer idea for Bitcoin's "purpose," and the idea that people would have been calling specifically the "store of value" endgame 7-8 years ago on anything other than a hunch is even more farfetched.

Unpopular question:
Shouldn't we be concerned over the introduction of "official" futures and this sort of thing? I mean, my greedy side welcomes it because the added "legitimacy" will extend BTC's run and drive up the price, but the revolutionary side of me says this is the sort of bullshit that caused the 2008 crisis. 
Bitcoin is already extremely speculative and its price doesn't reflect the amount of money that's been put into it; that's fine for now, probably a necessary step. But won't derivatives dramatically increase the systemic risk and raise the likelihood of a serious, crippling crash?
I don't believe it's possible to kill the crypto space completely, but I also think BTC has enough flaws that it's unreasonable to expect it to stay king forever. These developments would seem to exacerbate such concerns in the medium and long term.

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:28:03


Dude just because high speed internet is available in one remote region doesn't mean it is everywhere. Are you making these claims anecdotally or based on some actual research?
And again, it doesn't address the point of time prioritization and area of focus in general, so either way, you're still arguing just to argue.


This is not consistent with you bringing up doctor achievement as somehow being related to Bitcoin achievement, so my original argument stands. This is just talking in circles. Is doctor achievement related to Bitcoin achievement? Or not?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:38:22


I know you are, and I'm saying it's a mistake.


Any major crash. The issue is less whether or not the "product" of Bitcoin was faulty, and more if there could have been enough momentum in a competitor to overtake it at a moment of weakness. The fact that this didn't happen isn't proof that it couldn't have.


It was an understanding in terms of Bitcoin's unique promise, but my point is that a 2012 prediction like, "By 2017 Bitcoin will increasingly be seen as a store of value due to the rise of cryptos that specifically handle the cash use case better" would have ended up correct by survivor bias, not some kind of genius prescience.

I don't think tulip mania is a meaningful comparison. I think it's really lazy when people lump all these "money go big then pop" events into a single category.
Tulip mania: comparable to the Beanie Baby craze. The rapid valuation of an arbitrary commodity that could be swapped out for any other arbitrary commodity and not affect its fundamental interaction with the rest of the economy or human society. Could in principle become a sort of currency (consider shell/bead money),   but in the event of devaluation there is no reason to stick to this commodity over any other arbitrary commodity.
Dot com bubble: comparable to crypto bubbles. The rise of a new technology, method, or commodity that dramatically alters the workings of the economy. Undergoes "growing pains" as it is integrated into and revolutionizes the status quo. Marked by a proliferation of mostly worthless applications of the technology in a flurry of exploration into the boundaries of suitable use cases, which mostly fade away after bursts. The industry as a whole goes on to be more valuable than it ever was at peak frenzy. See also: s-curve of technological adoption.

Lol @ the idea that you're only an overachiever if you got into Bitcoin early
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:09:44
It's worth noting, though, that it won't necessarily be Bitcoin that reigns.
China *in particular* is going to want to have control over its own crypto; good private candidates are BCH and NEO, but the party may just concoct a government flavor named something incredibly lame like PandaCoin. 
This won't necessarily be an issue in practice as interoperability projects become established, but it probably won't be One Coin to Rule Them All in the end.

That also makes it prone to extremely high energy use, which is a non-trivial issue in an age where a different (and more immediate) type of security relies on transition to an energy paradigm we're still procrastinating over implementing
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:57:09
Even in that context I think it's flawed. If you were working as a doctor in a remote region with little access to internet for years, I don't think it is sensible to label you an "underachiever" if you get into Bitcoin late when you finally find out about it - even specifically within the context of Bitcoin and Bitcoin alone. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:48:07
I guess if you *never* get in you could technically be an overachiever according to what he said, but I sort of doubt that's what he meant.
Assuming all people eventually get into Bitcoin, an individual is only an overachiever if they got in early, because if they did not get in early, they are something other than an overachiever (an "average achiever" or an "underachiever").

I think the use case right now is "force new financial paradigm by mass transference of value," which it's doing a pretty good job at.
The idea that BTC should struggle one comic book store and hipster coffee shop at a time into being a viable alternative to the most powerful institutions on Earth is kind of an insane expectation. BTC needs to will itself into existence. I think what we're watching is pretty extraordinary; it's the process of a global civilization making a declaration on what should be considered valuable - and maybe the ultimate decision will be that BTC is no-go. It's not clear yet.
Money is a lot like language - it requires a huge amount of trust that worthless tokens (words or coins) faithfully represent or substitute for an external value or meaning. The guarantee that a word isn't a lie is just social expectation; the guarantee that a dollar can be traded for food is the same. The process of getting to that point is scary, because everyone has to be on board. But once everyone agrees, it becomes a precedent, which is hard to dismantle.
There's nothing absolute about the status quo. People flipped out about going off the gold standard (and some still do). The fact that it's nevertheless so hard to change and so widely accepted today goes to show how strong precedent - once established - really is.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:59:45


I don't think I ever gave some kind of full-throated support for that argument...


I tend towards being pretty deterministic, so while having certain innate advantages (robust constitution, mental fortitude, good looks, high IQ etc) will absolutely result in better outcomes most of the time, that's still nothing "you" had any control over. Individuals who have all those things may still be put into circumstances that slow them down - family issues, poverty, war-stricken nation, North Korea. I don't think it's appropriate to hold anyone accountable for those things, nor is it so simple as to say it's all on them to turn it into their own Musk scenario. It really just is much harder, and that continues to ripple throughout their life.
Absolute accountability - the pragmatic argument for social cohesion notwithstanding - requires the assumption of a degree of free will that I think is very difficult to make a case for empirically. That doesn't mean I think everything is "just luck" - we need to make the most of our opportunities and hard work and planning makes it possible to exploit them - but there is definitely a strong element of being in the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong one. You may have avoided the bus if you weren't jaywalking, but if you're looking up to make sure you don't get hit by falling beams, you aren't looking down to avoid open manholes. 
I think refusal to recognize how big a part it plays tends to be more out of a need to set oneself above or apart from others than based on some kind of hardnosed appraisal of what talent is or what have you. Without a doubt, people aren't interchangeable with a situation to get the same result. But we're also *way* more likely to overestimate ourselves than we are likely to be special in x or y way we want to believe we are.
Anyway, yeah, it does seem to be a matter of philosophy ultimately. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:09:16
This isn't Bitcoin, but consider interventionist gerontology organizations like SENS Research Foundation or AgeX.
Especially for young Bitcoin investors, this is a worthwhile area to consider putting some of your gains. Every year these institutions are properly funded is a year they have to bring interventions sooner and raise awareness to create a positive feedback loop of recognition and funding. They may not be working towards financial revolution, but are working towards a fundamentally transformative technology of their own.
Big players in Bitcoin are invariably those with a lot of vision and a lot of faith in young technology that others dismiss or scoff at. The Bitcoin community may be uniquely situated to help forever transform our society by taking the first step towards freeing us from the tyranny of death.

This is not research, this is anecdote. Can you provide your research demonstrating that 4G is available in nearly all remote regions?
Oh, but because "this is where you end," I guess you won't have to provide it. Convenient.


Um, but that's my whole point. It takes longer, meaning doctors don't have as much free internet time to be dicking around on message boards or reading cryptography whitepapers if they need to spend that time on research. This means that despite their access to internet, it may be some time before they have a chance to get around to looking into Bitcoin in depth. 
What if they end up making significant changes to the protocol, or become active members of the community, long after the price stabilizes? Are they "underachievers"? That's absurd. If they get in late, they aren't "Bitcoin underachievers," they're victims of circumstance. That is my point, and there's no way you can wiggle OP's words away from him *explicitly* stating that people who get into Bitcoin late are underachievers in terms of Bitcoin.


Still no answer, what a surprise. We had a disagreement of interpretation, that's fine, it happens. But you repeatedly framed me as making arguments I didn't even remotely make (some of your points about doctors had zero relevance to what I said), so I'd be careful with your accusations lol

The investors who saw it coming didn't have wrong vision - they were right to understand the *potential* - but let's be real, it's pure masturbation to say they were able to properly predict Bitcoin's rise with any kind of meaningful certainty. A competitor could have appeared and taken over early on. In fact that could STILL happen, although it's less likely.

This is clever, but far, far too subtle. It just looks like a stack of blocks.
I love minimalist designs - even (especially?) obscure symbolic ones - but it still needs to look like *something*. I think this design is going to be hard to pull off because even if you adjusted the pronouncement of the curvature, there will be an optical illusion effect where your brain makes them appear the same.

I remember I wanted to get some BTC way, way back, in the 2010 days, but mining was too complicated and purchasing was too sketchy, so I gave up.
I checked on the price now and then when it popped into my head, and until I finally got in, I said to myself one of two things:
When up: "Well, I missed it, too expensive now. It won't go higher than this."
When down: "Well, so much for Bitcoin, guess that's over."

What makes you say it'll rise above 1mil? I think that's roughly the upper limit, since around there it will hold equal value as USD. Even if it replaces ALL fiat, that would put it at about 4mil (assuming 15mil supply or 1/4 of bitcoins being lost).
