I agree with you, and I will be going to a cold wallet sooner rather than later, especially as holdings increase (most likely the nano s). However, for personal reasons, I would just like to start off with a web wallet, and become a little more familiar with the process of keeping my own keys, etc. I would only be transferring  $50-100 In BTC from the exhchage to start with. (So while obviously I'd rather not loose *anything*, it's not like my life savings are at risk). Hence this question.

How would I transfer the file from my regular desktop/OS to Linux. Is it possible with only one usb, or do I need one for Linux, and another for the file?

[Linux] liveboot is just booting into Linux from a USB.

You, know I've gotten enough positive feedback about bitaddress.org, and a good plan for best practices on how to generate (offline Linux usb boot/VM) that I think I'll go with that. But thanks for the options.

I'm gonna go cross-eyed reading that.

I will be moving to a hardware ware wallet in not to long, but for personal reasons, I'd still like to learn the ins and outs of at least one decent web wallet.

Interesting. Have you or anyone you know looked more closely at the code?
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:32:10
Yes. Misspelled in the title.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:47:07
Good to know.

I plan on doing this. But my concern is that the shenanigans might have been done in the writing of the program to begin with, so that the key-pair generated is essentially "pre-compromised" and the whole "randomly generated" part is a sham.
Also, I don't have a separate offline *computer* per se, just at best a VM. If I download the Web Archive from the site, copy it to the secure offline environment, generate the keys, print out the wallet and then securely wipe all traces of the program before connecting back online, will that be sufficient protection from any remote attacks/spying?

I really would have idea what to look for. You are correct in that I'm not a programmer - I wouldn't even know where to begin with parsing code.
Also, I'm pretty sure in 99.9% of the uses of verified FLOSS program, *individual* users didn't audit the code (unless you're a Stallman clone). At best a trusted third party did it.
Is there another program I can run the code through that would at least look for obvious red flags (yes, I realize we're getting into an infinite regress of trust issues here).

Honestly, this is a little beyond me.
I am using this site because it does everything. Generates key pair, encrypts private key with password, creates QR code, etc. I don't feel confident doing all that myself manually and not messing something up.

I think I will be trying with a liveboot usb instead. But essentially the same idea.

Honestly, I was hoping to juar use the hardware that I had. Plus, I have no programming skills. As I said to another commenter:

Paper wallets are a little too iffy for me. I appreciate all the advice, but I am specifically looking for a "*software/web wallet*, as I kind of said to begin with. I am aware of the risks/benefits. Not to be  unappreciate of everyone's experience here, but j was hoping to get some more straitforward recommends for that kind of wallet.
