Further breaking the analogy, Esperanto is intended as a ***second*** language, not intending to replace anyone's first language.

I think it's easier to acquire a second language after the first, because the brain creates some "language scaffolding" to hang a foreign language on. However, because Esperanto can be acquired quicker than some other languages, that can build the scaffolding up quicker to acquire other languages quicker.
^(Note: I learned Esperanto first, now working on French!)

That's been tried somewhat recently with the language [Ceqli](

Esperantist, here.
You can get the basics very quickly. It depends on how much you study, but many of the simple grammatical rules will be acquired within just an hour of study, I think. However be aware: Some people will tell you that "Esperanto is easy!" This - in my opinion - is not true. Language learning is *not easy*! Learning no language is easy. However, learning Esperanto is *easier*, but not easy.
The benefit of Esperanto is its modular nature, that you can learn a word, and multiply it by a bunch of suffixes and other roots, and make perfectly fine Esperanto words! So, once you learn one word, you learn many that go along with it. This also makes it a very playful, artistic, and flexible language -- by design. 
Learning Esperanto has also helped me to get out of the "English language bubble" to learn about other cultures. Because I invested a little bit of time, I have been able to meet Spaniards, Germans, Brazilians, Chinese, and Japanese - and communicate with them on a level language playing field, without any of us having to learn the other's home language. 
But, as I said before, learning languages is not easy! Learning vocabulary in Esperanto is like learning vocab in any language. It takes rote memorization of foreign words that will turn some people off. However, if you target/memorize/learn a few of the [1000 most commonly used Esperanto words]( (using a flashcard service like [Memrise]( to study these) and [the basics of grammar]( you will go a long, long way with the language! Good luck...
