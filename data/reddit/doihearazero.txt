Loans come first.
For example, Client A enters a bank and says: "I need $200,000 to buy a house. But I promise I'll work it off for you in the next 30 years."
Then the bank prints $200,000 to put into the house seller's account.
So while they did print the $200,000, they balanced it with that guy's mortgage, so in a way they didn't Net Issue any money.

I also wonder this, since Green Cash is usually coveted.

Bitcoin is not like the dollar, in the following sense.

If you owe $100,000 to the IRS and you bring them 25 bitcoins, they will reject you.

So this leads to the confusion of the export-import question. Drumpf claims it is catastrophic that China is sending us products. In reality, it's a boon.
So anyway, this confusion about "what was the goal, what was the symbol" has led people to mistakenly believe that Bitcoin has value.

Especially since Bitcoin can also trade for Fractions of a cent.
Before 2001, stocks didn't trade in decimals like 90.26 but in fractions like 90 1/4 dollars. In that sense a stock couldn't really be envisioned at $0.001
However a BTC could trade at $0.00000001 why not
So those that plan to pawn their mom to buy bitcoin at $2000 are commiting a cardinal error

I will now refute the argument called: "We are modern. This is modernity. You don't understand, this is the 22nd century" etc.
Wealth is not that easy to build, because it took 300,000 years to make my iPad Pro here.
So you can't just create wealth by saying "We are modern, you boomer."
The proof is in the following example. Let's suppose your laptop broke, and you say to a friend: "Do you have something similar, a PC?"
He says: "Absolutely. I have wealth even greater than that."
- "OK So give it to me. I need to complete my work."
He says: "I'm modern. This is modernity. Oh so modern nowadays. This is the new 23rd century."
- "What?? I can't do anything of value with those words, you retarded millennial."
As you can see from the above play, repeating the word Modernity constitutes exactly zero riches.

My new theory is that Bitcoin is a technology for Burning Money.
If for example you have $40,000 laying around the house, this thing can shovel $32,000 out the window

Yeah but when you have an apple, it has an obvious value.
But when you have a fucking Ledger, it's more of a means to something else, and not a direct consumable.
In that sense, I don't want to own a Ledger, and ergo the ledger's value is nill.

No I've never owned Bitcoin Cash. Is their cent also called a satoshi? I was gonna write I've never owned a satoshi of BCH.
For some reason I like Ver, maybe because he's my age.
Although truth be told he doesn't answer my Calls For Debate in youtube comments.

It seems that Mentioning Numbers has a big psychological effect in sales.
"Would you like to have $3,000,000? Buy zingcoin!"
- "Wow, he said $3,000,000. Such a sweet number. Now the $4000 cash I am about to give him sound like nothin'."

It would be theoretically possible to go Sub 0
For example the government announces that all Bitcoin owners will be subpoenaed
Then some company says: "Scared of appearing in court? We'll take your bitcoin off your wallet for a small fee of $29.99 per coin."
