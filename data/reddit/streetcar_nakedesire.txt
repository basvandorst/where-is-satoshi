It's not too late. Seriously. We thought $100 was insane. Then we thought the same at $500, and $1k, and $2k, and $3k...it will keep going up long term. Jump on. Owning one whole bitcoin is already out of reach for many people - what happens when banks and big money gets involved?  They won't acquire an asset to drive down the price. Buy a little, buy a lot, but do not listen to your fear - it is not yet too late.

I just had to explain to a guy you can't send ETH to a BTC wallet, and no, there are no 'chargebacks' if he sends it to the wrong address/wallet.
This was after I was trying to convince him not to store his 10 BTC on Bittrex. They're still there. Because "wallets are complicated, if an exchange wasn't safe people wouldn't be using it."
I think if I mention private keys he might honestly expect me to pull out a metal key.

Bullshit assumptions just piling up.
1) BCH was about easily buying coffee
2) Merchants not accepting BCH is the sole metric of success
3) A few weeks is sufficient time to make an ultimate judgement on these two systems
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.  With no chance of ever not being wrong. 
I'm not even going to address the fanciful hallucinations of "attempted coups". OP, there are plenty of valid critiques of 8X. As it stands, you are only weakening your own position and embarrassing yourself until you learn to make a decent argument. 
Edit: I am in support of luckyj's comment here.

There is a big debate on how Bitcoin transactions should be processed in the future and the result is a power struggle between different groups of miners (those who process transactions with computer hardware) and software developers. There are some tentative agreements right now between some parties but not others.
This is poking fun at most miners implementing a recent compromise with the expectation that it will lead to more changes in their favor (one of potentially several to come). 
That's my ELI 5 attempt.

edit:  I would recommend paying them not only because it is highly unlikely you will outsmart the IRS, but you're making the rest of us look bad.  this kind of bullshit will be what politicians point to as "criminal behavior" when it comes to crypto.  Just pay the man.

When the chain splits, it's like two coexisting timelines that reflect whatever is in your wallet at that time. In this case we can call BCH the 'alternate' timeline because it is newer, but both BTC and BCH are are based off of the same transactional history that came before it.  BTC and BCH will share all the transactions of the pastuntil August 1st, it's going forward that makes a difference. 
Let's say you have 1 whole coin in your current wallet.  After the split, you now have one coin on each timeline - 1 on the BTC timeline and 1 on the BCH timeline.  Since the BTC wallets already exist, you don't have to do anything different. Since the BCH wallets are new, you have to import your keys OR seed (seed will be simpler) to claim your BCH on that timeline. You basically have to show that your original coin existed prior to the split and thus ownership should be carried over to their new timeline.  You do NOT have to do this at any particular time.  You could wait ten years to import your info and your coin would still be there, assuming BCH still exists at that time.

You can set up your computer to process transactions for the bitcoin network and earn small amounts of bitcoin for your work. Like a part-time bankteller.  For a variety of reasons, all purpose GPUs are faster than CPUs and relatively cheap compared to a specific 'mining' device.  So people buy lots of GPUs to process more transactions and make more bitcoin.

Your seed will be easier to use. It automatically recovers all your private keys, of which there are usually many. 
Oversimplified explanation: the addresses you receive coin to are known as your public keys. They are tied to another, similar looking sequence of letters and numbers that only your wallet can view, known as your private keys. It is these two sets of keys, public and private, that makes up the "cryptographic" aspect of cryptocurrency.  The network uses these to validate transactions. Every address (public key) you have that has received coin is paired with its own private key, along with a history of private keys stored in your wallet file from past transactions.
AFTER August first, do not input your seed into a wallet on the BCH timeline without first moving your BTC to a separate wallet. Not just a separate address, a completely separate wallet, one with a brand new seed.

Evaluating using techniques applied to traditional currency is predictable - it's all they know.  They'll struggle until (IF) they find someone who truly understands this world and until then, continue to tell their old money readers what they want to hear because it's what they want to hear themselves.

Same, don't need it, but just wanted to test. In the end, one of the best possibilities of this system is promoting equality from top to bottom - anybody anywhere can exchange what they need. High fees truly harm that model. How to explain to my grandad that moving $1k might cost 2.5%?  Or a kid in rural Africa that he can buy coins with everything he saved but he didn't save enough to send them to his own wallet?  I don't expect the miners to work for free but when we cripple the feasibility of this system for all but the highest paying users, something has gone astray. At least in my view.
