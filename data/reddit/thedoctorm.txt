Enough to cover 1/2 of electricity and data bills.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:50:35
Nope, both are fake. But so is life, so...
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:26:42
How did you deal with the noise? How much is it?
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:40:36
Nooope, falling like a rock.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:28:10
Nope, i will run full node when i get small fraction of the fees. Miners burn electricity and data, get fees, nodes burn electricity and data, should get fees.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:18:36
Beautiful, a work of art.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:16:55
Today. Probably in the night. I personally have sold all few minutes ago.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:31:00
I made 2 SEPA transfers this week, both cleared in 3-5 hours.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:41:11
This is it for today. Perhaps in a next pump it will got to 18k. But now, back to 14k.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:01:16
Back on track to another dump. Better have fiat when it happens if you wanna buy cheap sweet BTC's.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:08:52
But, but, but... the added security of having millions of nodes! :)
And google would block this after a few days almost instantly.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:31:58
If you run in no nonstop, that beats the purpose of "running a full node".
If i run full node for 1 hour a month am i really "running a full node". Nope.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:32:21
I think this is the last major dip, before it goes to 30k+ in next 3 months.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:14:14
Fees for running full nodes are inevitable future. If miners get maid to burn electricity, full node owners should too.
There will be no more voluntarism in bitcoin world very soon.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:06:50
So... sooner than 5 years?
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:31:21

Another day, another chinese shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:56:53
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:48:51
Going to 25k in Jan.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:53:10
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:47:23
Last hour it fell 250$ on bitstamp, check the trend, its downwards. Like a skipping stone, slowly but surely back to 14k.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:21:40
Aaaaaaand its dropping again.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:39:04
I would be willing to invest 1/2 of electricity bill towards added security.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:39:44
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:31:07
- Fees from tx's. 
- Tx fees 
- None. Fixed percentage of the fee, such as like 0.0001%. Should be calculated aprox. to cover 1/2 cost of 1 average pc runing 24/7.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:38:54
Said the Enron shareholder. :D Joking, please sell, so i can buy cheap! Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:22:47
So shitty it is true.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:42:05
Yes, exactly. Too fast.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:50:09
Do not question the Bitcoin! It works in mysterious ways!
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:03:48
It is going to go to 13k in 12 hours. Too long it was supressed downwards.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:21:53
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:42:42
I do have the fiat, i am just waiting for the big crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:05:15
"You can't lose long term if you HOLD." Says the Enron stock owner.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:16:14
Nope. Tonight it will dip at least -20%, before CME futures start. The lower it is, the more they can win long. That's why the long steady rise of price, they bought up ALOT of coins in last months. Whales will SELL every BTC before the star of CME futures trading, the first thing in the morning they will bet long on futures, which will obviously happen, and starting buying BTC back, increasing the price, and boosting their profits on futures market. Its a double win for them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:28:04
Not at all. It would need to fall to 9000€ for me to get interested.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:57:13
Also me: "Bitcoin price could go down another 20 times"
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:56:09
Better word would be most horrifying crash ever seen in BTC. Just wait and see.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:13:12
Please hold guys, and sell later for 10k. :D
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:42:26
Better that way. What if she said: leave husband, steal bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:40:25
I don't buy it. I think the price is hyperinflated and is about to blow to "normal" sustainable levels, around 5 to 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:51:10
I cashed out. Been fun ride.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:44:53
Fiat. As technologically, there are other cryptos which are superior.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:04:52
Just fuck off, beggar.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:45:59
Right now? As in seconds?
Or minutes, days, weeks, months?

@_date: 2017-12-09 16:52:06
The fappening. Just keep hodling, they say. :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:10:06
Everytime i hear BTC will go over $50k: 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:46:08
Nothing, what do you think should happen?
Better question is.. why WOULD they cash out (all their BTC's)?
They will sell some % over time as needed for other investments and that is it. They will keep majority of their BTC's for decades, at least if nothing major happens with BTC technology, or some other crypto comes along which will be vastly technologically better.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:45:43
current situation
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:18:16
Yes. Now is the time to reap the rewards.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:40:17
Very hard, but it will last very short time. After that we wil have long period of flaccid state or stagnation even.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:10:15
The force is strong in this one. There can be only one, remember that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:16:46
I already cashed out so i'm good. If it falls to 9k€ i'll probably rebuy. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:41:41
Good job! Be smart, don't be HODLer.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:46
Buy low, sell high, buy higer, sell higher, buy even higher ...
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:35:11
Dont HODL, sell high, buy low.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:28:12
Currently sold out. Check daily for stock.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:20:30
-6% so far, and more dip coming tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:49:03
Don't hold! Sell now, and buy 1/3 cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:56:02
We will be there with fiat to buy at 5k€.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:58:03
Don't sell it to him. 
Also don't sell now and help him in this dump. He will run out of his BTC's eventually. Or the shorters in the futures market are selling their BTC's before the January. Anyway in mid January the price will be 25k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:38:20
You are not investor, and you are not investing. It is called speculating. You would invest money in a new startup or smth.

Chinese miners mining only low fee tx, just part of the attack on BTC.

"only doubling their money" You are one funny guy.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:41:14

Ahhh, the goodness of heart? In BTC? LOL
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:45:59

@_date: 2017-12-13 18:46:28
Andreas really has incorrect logic on the electricity/mining thing. One of his rare BIG blunders.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:00:46
Nope, he really missed the point here completely. Power plants are designed for future demand, and if you use 100% of them now for BTC minig, it means new powerplants will be needed in the future, and not the ones already operational. You cannot spin this, BTC mining is not ecological, UNLESS you use renewable sources of energy.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:19:51
Not on Bitstamp!
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:33:35
Logic, and the data how much money can flow into exchanges per day... As soon as the growth stagnates, money will go to other alts or cash out. BTC will drop horrendously.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:28:16
We will see, perhaps already on monday.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:32:23
You do that, but me, i already cashed out! Yihaaaa!
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:45:25
DON'T use cloud authenticator. It is just dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:02:36
It is going to drop HARD, soon.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:27:08
Going to $8k! Tonight! This is what futures do. VOLATILITYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:45:25
dead cat bounce, it will be below 10k€ in a couple of hours.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:26:17
Also, if you can get some Chinese guy to buy it for you, they can buy it cheaper and send it to you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:30:40
25k by mid January.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:50
i know what what will happen. tommorow 5-8k€, on monday 2-4k€, then slowly in a few weeks to 20k€.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:29:06
The way to go!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:29:32

@_date: 2017-12-05 17:33:59
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:59:24
Nah, ill cash out when i want to, to buy things i need for which i invested in so volatile crypto in the first place. And while you wait for coin to become only money in the world, ill be enjoying the things i bought with fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:40:53
Good, i have some orders at 5k.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:24:27

Mid January 25k. As soon as the dump ends, and the shorts on the futures are won.
High fees&lt;a lot of unconfirmed tx's&lt;spam attack.

Enforcability comes from exchanges. They are/will be required to report all BTC owners. IRS comes next. For pure BTC to drugs tx i don't care about. I don't need my BTC for this purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:46:56
The price is still falling. Still because of some obscure exchange? I still don't buy it. I don't have 75k deposit to start trading futures.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:42
You screwed up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:51:40
Exactly, at 7k.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:06:06
Antminer has suspected lifespan of less than 1 year, so... Chips running on 90C, can't be long lasting. So, if you have extra 0.1BTC to spare and cheap electricity (or free), why not.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:40:21
Yes, Very hard, very soon.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:20:58
Or down. Or stay at the same price.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:33:56
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:36:21
Use kryptocurrency that works, even under heavy load. BTC is proven that it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:07:18
This is not true. On which exchanges did BTC/€ get to 10k€?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:26:10
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:50:49
It will drop 50%, very soon.

The question now is, will it burn or will it crash? :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:58:32
Even at a technical side, it is so simple for governments to require BTC owners to register them or face penalties. I am talking about a regular guy having and trading BTC, not drug users. And even they will use more anonymous friendly cryptocoin. In my opinion, BTC omnipotency is a myth, which will be blown, as soon at the governments feel it is required to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:33:14

- stagnation (technologically better coins appear and gain public appreciation)
- growth
- world domination

@_date: 2017-11-22 14:11:26
Yes. But with this mania going on, seems everyone is forgetting that there is a small chance BTC might fail meaning other technologically superior crypto will be discovered. And BTC might go to history.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:08:42
NO weak hands, left crystal ball is unmistakenable. Dip -30% tonite.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:24:11
Good for you! I meanwhile lost several thousand €, when i couldn't make an order for buy on 7150€. Edit: Also NONE of set SMS price alerts came to my phone. FUCK THIS!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:30:45
Which corner?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:25:22
No, no. It should be SELL, SELL. Shit always goes down.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:03:54
Won't Bitfinex ban apply only to cryptos from ICOs?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:31:57
Most accurate.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:33:52
I think is the first wave of BCH pump. Stay tuned for wave 2. (meaning BTC dip, larger than last one)
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:17:37
Yes, the BCH pump will last for some days.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:51:56
Hell, no im not buying that nonecological shit! (google for copper and lithium mining, non renewable batteries, co2 releases from thermal electrical plants...)
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:00:34
I will get it when it is hotter, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:54:51
Don't forget the kill switch teslas have. I won't drive anything that has "kill me instantly" switch built into it, never.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:39:48
"Price of Bitcoin has gone up 0.05% in the last one hour, up 3.78% in the last 24 hours and down 6.71% in the last 7 days."
Real rollercoaster ride. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:30:00
I have balls of steel. I say dip this weekend hard.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:10:35
WTF is "BTC2" named in installation in Choose start menu folder?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:47:32
You meant, prepare your fiat to buy BTC cheap?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:11:47
Falling like Fenix into flame.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:01:52
Completely flatlined. Buying "real" Bitcoin BCH. NOT!
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:26:56
My thoughts precisely.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:19:47
Nope. He will sell, when it goes to 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:18:35
I am replying to topic, when will young people sell their BTCs. Could be $190k or could be $50.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:52:10
Going down 30%!
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:12:50
Wow - "And in the long run I promise you, you will look back on this as the best decision you have ever made."
Scouts honor?
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:49:28
Not sarcastic. It will go down 50%.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:59:07
Never gonna say goodbye...
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:33:41
I'm not touching that with a virtual stick.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:10:33
Oh yea!
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:33:09
Buy now, before BTC drops way more.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:47:27
Looking forward to it, if it happens.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:20:57
OMG! Heaven!
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:05:24
Buy cheaper then HOLD.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:47:57
Well, yes. How did you know?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:13:17
Explosive mega bubble
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:01:43
The train is coming in 5 hours tonight. You better buy the ticket then.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:56:59
Yes, only more autistic.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:32:19
1. 150%
2. Yes
3. Yes
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:07:22
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:09:37
When it falls from 25% and below, then we are talking dip.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:02:45
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:02:36
I'm "sad" that it is not 3500, not 8000+.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:18:51
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:42:08
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:00:19
It will be nice to watch that $100 turn to $50 in a week.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:54:01
Login to Bitstamp (get verified) and make SEPA € deposit. The next day you can buy BTC there.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:28:16
You don't understand what volatility means.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:06:48
Spoiler: he doesn't have left ball.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:47:14
No, i don't like hedgehogs.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:27:41
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:17:23
I am not suprised that Ver's investment - Kraken doesn't work properly.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:14:18
BS. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:29:05
99% not 8000.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:28:16
Yeah it will work out in in 2 years. Have fun.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:17:18
You didn't think there will be all rise until the fork did you? Remember, all these memes, and ppl shouting HODL, you know they know nothing, do you?
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:31:09
Let's down vote all threads that says "no more memes/prices threads"!
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:36:54
Me too, but what are you gonna do?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:52:20
First ISS, then Mt. Everest, then ocean, then Moon.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:16:39
I have crystal left ball, so i'm good.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:43:48
Not really, it has been 5940-5920 for half an hour on bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:03:58
Aaaaaaaand, its falling again!
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:43:14
When does the beg address come into play?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:26:41
Buy you can't buy covfefe with BTC!
At least so say the Ver fans.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:46:26
At least -30% tonight.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:56:15
I agree. Sell if you have profit. You will buy much cheaper soon.
TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:11:34
Crystal ball is never wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:41:30
Buy at the incoming dip.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:25:47
I'm buying back BTC right now! It will go up fast today and especially on Monday.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:11:42
Next stop 5k.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:15:33
No, thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:27:34
Gonna drop like a stone.
 Today is payday, and as soon as those paychecks are spent on this "mini dip" the real dip will begin. My left crystal ball says so.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:56:26
Let's see until tomorrow, ok?
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:35:16
It will bring it on!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:24:28
Don't do business with Kraken, or any other Ver's businesses.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:55:47
Americanos will. It is a huge holiday for them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:21:01
never say never
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:15:42
I think we are going to 5000€ BTC in a matter of few days.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:33:14
No, the people only have so much  cash to spend on volatile investments. Remember investments after costs - house, kids, living expenses... After all the savings are spend, only certain% of monthly income can go to inflating the price of BTC. And i think this is not enough for 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:53:14
I'd say more accurate term would be greed badger.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:14:30
Or when it falls to $50, whichever comes first.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:15:28
If you have profit so far, sell and buy cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:32:30
I don't believe it 1%.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:47:31
It ain't over yet.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:41:49
never ever ever
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:38:53
I will wait for XMAS sale with 50% off.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:50:53
Yes, it should be.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:09:24
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:20:47
Sell and buy cheaper, i'd say.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:24:50
I think the pot is about to blow, it just needs one really bad "news". Something like some obscure document from China banning hydro power for mining etc.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:30:08
To cash in profits? Remember, you didn't win anything until the money is on your bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:56:45
Calling Elvis, is anybody home?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:48:13
This is far from cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:49:20
Bitstamp if 100% out. Lame ass incompetent slovakian IT guys. Sitting on 100s of millions and their "business" fails as soon as there is major run. Fuck that. How many servers and bandwidth can you get for $1MM? Iam sure tomorrow everything and everyone else will be to blame.. "Chinese, Russians, ddos, aliens, but certainly not us."
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:26:36
Not without big institutional players. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:55:01
I just saw it my my left crystal ball. Remember, you read it here first.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:33:05
Dip into salsa!
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:30:53
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:03:53
Is it a chocolate cat?
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:27:25
But why he needed so many knives????
Brave man, i salute you!
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:36:08
Buy high, sell low.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:12:06
I see that now, what a fuck fest. Jeez. Lost 1 day of my life because of it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:24:03
Well, actually, if you invest in crypto, you are taking a bet already. And bets are won or lost, member?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:02:28


How do you know that?
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:45:17
That is true. Nope, i like this one.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:28:26
Buy low and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:20:09
There will always be dips. You just need to wait.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:25:02
I think real dip will come today, in roughly 6 hours. Might be -30% by morning. We will see if i am right in the morning.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:19:48
What if opponents of S2X are setting up these nodes? As a diversion and to blame S2x for it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:56:12
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:12:53
Incoming drop in 5,4,3,2,1: 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:46:05
Smart uncle Bob.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:11:15
So? What say you? You like at 5600€?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:47:21
Thank you for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:44:25
The key word is WHEN, exactly.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:03:57
Remember, you don't drown, if you just stay on the boat! Teatanic.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:55:19
It is a possibility. Although unlikely, but still.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:08:10
Yes, most likely, but not for sure.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:08:13
Today we are going to the moon! Tomorrow - beyond.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:30:52
Looks this is happening now. YUUUGE red candles incoming.
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:20:36
I don't believe that.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:54:22
Are both girls 10 yr old?
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:03:40
It did rise for a moment there, but, but, more YUUUGE red candles incoming... Before monday, we will be sub$9k.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:24:05
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:28:48
I will be able to buy BTC $ soon, so excited.
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:09:30
You mean, you were programing the app, and you fucked your gf form time to time.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:28:55
100% /s
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:15:57
China bans all crypto trading! I have reliable insider sources. /s
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:21:57
Oh, but they do, when the price goes -50%, the ass cheeks tighten 50%.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:45:27
One time it appears to be going to the moon, and other time to zero. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:02:28
Sovereign states, now that's a real joke!
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:40:14
I expect going flat all day. And before evening massive sellout to 7k€.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:23:34
Last night i watched IT, to relax a little from all this crypto-horror.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:16:21
McAfee says so too.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:21:41
I am thinking somehow in the same direction. After that +50%.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:40:43
6k is coming up shortly. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:54:27
I agree. And buyback @ $6k.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:49:46
O, it is going dooooooooooooooooooooooooown.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:19:03
The stuff you buy your BTC with.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:36:54
Let's deduct another 15% from this price ... Bro WTF?
What are you smoking?
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:53:06
OH YES. Watch the charts. YUUUUUGE! And they are here.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:39:14
But the 20m cap can be easily changed if the BTC community will support it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:36:51
HOLD 4 EVER! (except when you sell and buy cheaper)
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:14:54
Falling from the sky...
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:42:20
Love Dr. /s
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:30:15
Hold on for dear life. Or sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:23:53
Or sell. Last chance!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:20:32
Dropping low, flying high, and somewhere in between.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:37:25
Nope, i sold 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:15:26
Time to sell, and buy 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:30:12
I got all the time in the world. Don't you?
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:03:23
Nope, i feel the dumpening.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:37:13
And please sell all your bitcoins, please, please.
I wanna buy 
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:18:39
It feel from 8500€ to 8000€ in a few hours. Candles so red, my eyes bleed. And YUUUUGE.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:19:15
At $0.0001 i'd buy several millions of BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:22:40
We idiots from Europe, just selling for nice profits from 7700€ to 8400€. 7% is a 7%.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:30:32
Not correct. Also drunk on tuesdays and thursdays.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:43:30
The only stategy agains whales is, buy cheap and hold. If it drops even lower, buy some more. Never sell. Or do, i don't care.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:38:26
Shitty feeling.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:18:31
I might. And i did buy. Now, new chance for stacking some more BTC's.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:47:42
Yes. Perhaps they could send me some coins. :)
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:21:29
Dumpening is imminent. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:01:25
Nope, just a lot of nice Fouriers graphs and a warm room.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:17:41
Buy low, sell high ... Well now is low, so you know what to do.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:21:01
Same as ever other analysis here, chicken guts, bunch of lines, and FUD.
Other than that, friday is the likely day to cash our weekly profits.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:19:28
I still don't know where is this "largest democracy in the world."
Also fuck China and India FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:27:29
$6k soon. Save your fiat, it will get more valuable soon!
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:26:24
Or, as economists like to call it, a speculation.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:17:08
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:25:07
On Sunday, steady fall, 5-10% more. On Monday 25% up. Next Friday 25% up.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:04:41
Sell, you fools... And leave some for me at $6k.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:34:44
Bear trend for at least 1 week. Both $10k and 8k€ have been breached.
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:54:07
Pump has ended, get ready for hard dump to $7k.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:47:23
First ground, then moon.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:47:46
And in two weeks it will be low @ 5k. Just keep buying. Thank me later.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:48:39
Like BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:19:13
Yes, but first $6k.
