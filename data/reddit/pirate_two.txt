But low fees are bad for bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:31:48
So bitcoin cash cant implement LN? closed software?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:27:20
how can we know, that it was not accelerated by miner?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:21:47
no, just malfix
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:27:46
if estimating fees is just an algorithm, why everyone fails to implement it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:29:15
how did you calculate?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:44:33
agree, can't wait for Lightning Network it will bring L2 fees down significantly. But we will still need to commit LN on very expensive L1 (because high fees are good). Maybe there is a way to remove L1 entirely and rename L2 to L1?

core increasing block size? thats new to me :/
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:51:57
LN team said it will be ready in 18 month, so 2019
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:25:40
Oh, so LN has less risk than on-chain tx?

I live in Lithuania and we have these FoxBox ATM's all over the country ~100. They run different services, and one of them is FIAT-&gt;Bitcoin. They take FIAT and then send Bitcoin private key to your mailbox (using spectrocoin.com). No registration required. Here is the map:

Gold is just a rare metal spread in the ground, not evenly (you have advantage if you own a good mine, and don't share it with other diggers) that is why it's so easily centralized.  
Bitcoins are rare numbers and everyone shares the same mining space, so the playing field is more equal and fair. Competition is only with mining equipment and I'm ok with that. I don't buy shovels or ASIC's, leave mining to professionals. 
Bitcoin is about functionality for me, not about profit.

Yeah, you can count as 1, but still more bytes on average. 
Discount you say? But by using this discount MY signatures are not stored on TheBC
