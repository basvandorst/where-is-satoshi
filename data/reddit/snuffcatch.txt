Why are you assuming that everyone invested in crypto has everything riding on it?  I own about a month's salary worth of btc, and just sit on it endlessly. If McAfee is right,  I'll be rich,  if he's wrong,  I'll still be wealthy.  Not every investor is a 20 year old line cook praying for the SICK GAINZ. Any sane person is already aware there's more to life than btc.

I remember people even saying it would be 1k  when it was over 200.  I'm sure they lost substantial money as well.

I mean there's nothing wrong with day trading if there's a real trend. I traded all the way down from 16k to 7k during the last dip. but calling 400 bucks an indication of any sort of future trend is how people end up losing all their money.  Btc is just the first place most people (myself included) have done any sort of day trading, so they get burned. I did back when I first invested, but thats how I got to the point where I can actually turn profits fairly consistently

How is the generation born after 2000 anything similar to millennials, who grew up with vhs, home phones instead of smart phones,  America online cd's, dial up internet,  SNES, among many other outdated technologies.  Kids born only 10 years after myself (93) have had the world's information at their fingertips ever since they could read.  Saying those two generations are anything but worlds apart is just ignorant.  It's like saying people who grew up a decade before me didn't have it any different,  while they were playing pacman on massive machines and the internet didn't exist.  Sorry but your "historically accurate" opinion doesn't really hold up against the exponential growth of technology, and it's impact on the world,  especially our youth.
