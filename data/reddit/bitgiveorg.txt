BitGive does!  
And also we have a donation platform GiveTrack with charity projects all over the world that you can donate bitcoin to, and it's also integrated with Uphold so you can donate in 12 different cryptocurrencies!

Good stuff!  Check out Guidestar to review them and make sure they are in good standing, etc. so that you make good solid donations that will make actual and positive change and also boost Bitcoin for doing good. You can do this pretty quickly with Guidestar.  They also have lists to get ideas from :)

The distinction is that BitGive was founded and filed as an organization on the basis of Bitcoin.  Yes, there are many NGOs that accept Bitcoin.  They already had their approval from the IRS prior to Bitcoin coming along and now they accept it as a form of donation. There is a definitely a distinction, and it's an important one for Bitcoin, not just BitGive.  We filed in full transparency as a Bitcoin-based Foundation, operating globally, and received the tax exemption stamp of approval from the IRS.  
Additionally, to clarify, tax exemptions are granted on both the federal and state level.  So, this status not only provides our donors a tax deduction, we also do not have to pay taxes (both federal and state) on the gains of our Bitcoin holdings.  This is another significant benefit, as it allows us to do so much more with your donations.  
See here for more detail on the significance of this -

Jason you have so much to be proud of and so much you've accomplished!!!  You have helped so many, inspired so many, supported and cheered on SO MANY!!!  It is a super tough road, I HEAR you, and I'd argue a very different challenge with nonprofit.  Especially in our community where the language, atmosphere, everything is about business.  Nonprofit is a whole different world, literally.  You have friends and supporters all around you.  Feel free to reach out to me or any one of us.  Just do what's best for you and don't worry about the rest.  It all works out somehow in the end :)

I realized that after I posted that!  I am not real big on reddit, haha!

Anyone who had coins previously.  In previous years, IRS guidance was not in place prior to the close of the tax year.  This year, guidance is in place and people who bought at lower value than current value have realized gains.  
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:28:05
That was what we asked them to do! They are stepping up and leading by example in this community in so many ways.  Not only are they one of the top leading companies in Bitcoin, carrying forward Bitcoin in many ways, they also provide their services at no cost to non profits and have supported BitGive, Sean's Outpost and many other organizations.  Did you read the article?

Thank you so much!  You hit the nail on the head!  Our press release going out today talks about this exactly as does the Bitcoin Foundation's PR -

Alah!  You know we love and support you!  Let us know how we can help more in the future.  Last we spoke you were still getting a website and way to accept donations directly.  Let's talk off line as I'm not on reddit much!  Keep up the great work!

Thank you very much!  I have tried to withdraw it and deposit it into The Water Project wallet and am having a bit of trouble.  Can someone help?

Great piece from ChangeTip!  And great discussion! 
We at BitGive do offer much of what the video is covering and much of what you're discussing in the comments here. We are working on a few POS options we hope to have ready in 2015.
We are a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit, so you can get a tax deduction (if you wish).  To do so, you use the form so that a receipt can be generated (for IRS purposes, our name, your name, and the BTC amount needs to be on the receipt if you're writing it off). You can also donate **anonymously** through the QR code or static wallet address -  
We also run campaigns for NGOs that don't accept BTC, and right now we are running one for Medic Mobile -  
Donations to the Medic Mobile campaign are also tax deductible and if you wish to do them **anonymously** you can by using the form and **only entering the BTC amount** *(there isn't a QR code or wallet address, because our payment service provider has stopped offering those for new accounts)*.
  
We have a separate sign up for Members, Founding Donors, and our newsletter where we do ask for at least a name and an email address, but these are optional programs and there are other ways to donate to us as I mentioned above. 
If you are interested in the tax deduction, donations have to be made before the end of the calendar year to count towards your 2014 taxes and you need a receipt.  
We have partnered with LibraTax and they have developed software where you can calculate your taxable gains (based on how long you've had the coins and their value when you purchased/received them) and you can also calculate how much you could donate to offset those gains, thereby reducing (or even eliminating) your due taxes.  
Here is LibraTax's Blog on this topic - 
Also a great article came out yesterday in Forbes about this - 
Thanks and Happy Bitcoin Holidays Everyone!!

Our intent is not to be a "clearing house," but instead a bonified foundation that has significant holdings and is able to give back in a robust and sustainable manner on a global scale over the long term.  
Instead of providing lists of charities, we are actually providing them with support, recognition, grants, fundraising campaigns, etc.  Of course we are young and need financial resources to reach this vision, and in the meantime we are raising funds for select organizations.  
Because we are 100% volunteer, we are only able to do one campaign at a time.  We are currently raising funds for The Water Project, bringing clean, safe water to communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Once we reach our goal of $10,000 (BTC equiv.), we will have funded an entire project (likely a new well) for a school or community.  Pretty amazing stuff!  
You can support this amazing organization (that is also a 501 c3) by donating here -  and 100% of your donation will go to The Water Project.  
A few "lists" are available, if this is your desire, on wikipedia, bitcoin100.org, coinosphere, and a few others.  There are quite a few, actually.  
@_date: 2014-05-29 01:11:03
That shouldn't be an issue. English is a pretty universal language.  You'll find it not to be an issue really.

This is TWP's first Bitcoin fundraising campaign, and we've been totally shown up by Dogecoin's Charity Water donations.  
Tomorrow is World Water Day!  What a better time than NOW!

This is not being led by the BitGive Foundation, we were only challenged.  To my knowledge, ALS has not started to accept Bitcoin yet.  
The BitGive Foundation is actually supporting The Water Project and you can donate in Bitcoin directly to them and help bring clean, safe water to community in sub-Saharan Africa.

THANK YOU!! Pine, you are a true hero and the leader that this community needed! We are a proud and grateful recipient of one of the first four contributions from the Pineapple Fund and so excited and ready to leverage your investment in BitGive to build the future of philanthropy with Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.

Thanks, OmniEdge.  I agree, but that is a question/issue for Coinbase and The Water Project who is using Coinbase as well.
We (at BitGive) use BitPay and can download our ledgers and see the addresses, but again, some of them may be unique to that transaction.  
Currently, the only way to identify the donor is if the donor shares their email address.  If they want to write off the donation from their taxes, they will need a receipt, which also requires an email address to be provided.

I would also suggest going mostly global intentionally.  A lot of the charitable activity in Bitcoin currently is in the US.  Would be great to have it embody the global aspect of Bitcoin more.  
@_date: 2014-08-21 05:07:06
BitGive Foundation here.  We accepted with two modifications: 1. No wasting water and 2. Donations are made to The Water Project.  
Explained ... 
1. While we support ALS, we cannot encourage wasting water.  Instead, we will be doing the Dirt Bucket Challenge, challenged by Mad Bitcoins to raise drought awareness.  Dirt Bucket Challenge -  
2.  ALS has also already raised over $4 million with this challenge.  There are MANY charities and nonprofits who need support, and we are committed to our campaign for The Water Project.  Compared to the $4 million ALS has ALREADY raised, we are seeking less than $2,500 to complete our campaign to build an entire water project for a community in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The Water Project works to bring clean, safe water to communities in sub-Saharan Africa, where a source of clean water is a rare luxury.  The children, who should be in school, are instead walking miles a day to collect and bring back dirty water to their families, encountering dangers and harm along the way. Communities are so hard stricken to simply survive that learning, growing, and being empowered are a far away dream.  The work that The Water Project is doing has provided clean, safe water sources for countless communities; and in so doing, has empowered the children and community members to learn, grow, and improve their health and well being. 
If the Bitcoin community wants to show its generosity, we have our own Bitcoin-lead campaigns and efforts that you can support.  And of course, you can also still pile on top of the $4M at ALS.

Thank you BitPay!  This is awesome and we greatly appreciate your support!

Thank you!  
So I added some proof of identity links above.  Also, if you donate, it's actually directly through The Water Project, so you can see the other donations that have come through and also they have all their documentation online.  They will also issue a receipt.  It's all here -  
BitGive Foundation is currently in the process of applying for a 501c3 and applied in September of 2013, but the IRS says minimum of 9 months and we are hearing sometimes much longer.

This is great!  I know exactly what you are saying.  Even in less tech-heavy circumstances this question is not an easy one to answer! There are services that evaluate charities like Guidestar and Charity Navigator, but they are US centric and also use outdated/misguided criteria like % of funding to admin/overhead instead of looking at outcomes and effectiveness.  Bitcoin being global would ideally include charities all over the world, which poses one (big) challenge; and evaluating a charity for validity, etc. is equally as challenging. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:30:26
Thank you!  Our reddit account already goes directly to BitGive, but I'd love to see others setting up the redirect option, if they so wish!

Would be great to have something like this focused on charity.  We have been asking around for developer time to be donated to create some things that would be great for charity, but Bitcoin developers are a rare commodity these days!

I should add that for the Save the Children drive 100% went to the charity.  
Our other programs under development will include some mechanisms for supporting the organization itself, but we will follow best practices and keep our overhead and administrative costs low.

We are only accepting Bitcoin at this time.  And we are giving in BTC and fiat.  It's very limiting to only give in BTC at this time, but we are doing our part to educate charities about accepting BTCs as well.

Hi - Please check out our website for more detailed information  There is also a brochure you can download - 
We are very new, so we have only been able to do one donation to a charity thus far - Save the Children and their Philippines Relief Effort.  
We are still forming our programs and policies, fundraising and marketing, etc.  We are all volunteers at this time and are looking for start-up funds and donations to get the organization off the ground.  A lot more fundraising is needed at this time for us to deliver our mission; however we will continue to try to do things like the Save the Children Drive in the meantime.
Thanks for your interest!

Thank you, BitcoinWife for supporting the BitGive Foundation and many other charities doing great work with BTC donations!  We love and support Sean's Outpost as well, but would love to see the BTC community represent the global potential for giving at the scale and breadth that Bitcoin provides the opportunity for!  And for those interested in holding the BTC for value increase, BitGive Foundation is set up to to have a long term giving fund that functions from BTC gains as well as to do short term drives for current needs and causes.  check us out at
