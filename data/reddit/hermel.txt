They probably won't convert anything, but take away 36% of your ETH and distribute them among the former BTC holders, using the published exchange rates. So they can decide for themselves whether they want to exchange the ETH to BTC or keep them.
This would also mean that the users who had BTC in their account will get USD, ETH, and ETC worth 64% of their BTC.

I didn't fully read it either, but here is my interpretation: in a proof-of-stake system, you often have a set of confirmed validators. To become a validator, you need to perform a certain transaction. However, the other validators can refuse to validate that transaction, effectively censoring you. It's like the miners being able to vote on who can become a miner. Obviously, they have an incentive to keep others out. So how does Casper / Weak Subjectivity address this? They say: if anyone is caught doing this (and it is not hard to prove that this is happening as it only works if all validators cooperate), we will create a fork in which the attacker loses all his money and let every user decide which one to choose. It is in the interest of the users to choose the fork, so they should do that. Note that if everyone knows how this works and believes that it actually does, no validator will ever even attempt to exclude new validators.
There are a number of additional attack vectors, but the key to address them is always the same: make sure the attack is easily detectable, make sure the attack can only be performed very slowly (validator funds are locked up for months), and then threaten with a fork in case someone performs the attack. That's also the reason it is called "subjectivity", because you will need supporting information from outside the system in order to decide which fork is the good one.

If the hacker had access to the hot wallet, it is not a stretch to assume that he also had access to user accounts. That's probably also why Bitfinex is asking all its users to reset their passwords and 2fa. However, a rational thief goes for the valuable stuff first, i.e. first stealing all Bitcoins, then all Ether, and identities last. Given that he was stopped while stealing the Bitcoins, he probably did not get any further.

To be fair, it is a little more robust than what I wrote above. But it still boils down to the user not being able to reproduce the current state of the blockchain unless he gets additional information from someone he can trust not to have censored certain information.

That's nitpicking about the meaning of "socialize". I used it because that's what the others used here. It is not perfect, but I think everyone understood it correctly, meaning that the users share the loss. And that's exactly what would happen in a bankruptcy: all the creditors (including the users) would share the loss.

I'm not aware of a single country that relaxed copyright laws in the past 20 years. Are you? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:25:04


It's more subtle than that. A bankruptcy court would (probably) socialize the losses among all the users.* However, they write about "a socialized loss scenario among bitcoin balances and active loans to BTCUSD positions".
In other words: losses will be shared between those users who had Bitcoins and those users who provided them the loans to buy those Bitcoins. Other balances, like ETH or plain USD would not be affected.
In my opinion, this makes sense. Providing a loan to a trader of one of the most volatile currencies on the planet comes with certain risks, and this is one of them.
\* Note: this probably depends on the jurisdiction and whether the unaffected balances were held in segregated accounts. For example, if the client's USD are held in an account in the name of the client, that client does not have to participate in the losses. The same should be the case for the ETH balances if they are held in separate accounts per user.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:43:46
That calculation is wrong, due to erroneous assumption about what happens with lent USD balances. Assuming the borrower uses them to buy BTC, they are immediately turned into someone's unlent balance again. So you cannot subtract that from those 42 million and the correct amount is 42 million, which is not extremely high, but credible.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:00:46
That's not true. Whoever sold the BTC to the borrower got USD in return and is free to withdraw them.

AFAIK,  that problem is supposed to be solved by the end user. This sounds worse than it is. As an end user,  you would typically open a channel with xapo, coinBase,  bitpay etc,  load the channel with some bitcoins and then let those companies work out the details as you spend them.

The argument back in December was that segwit is a more complex change than a 2mb hard fork. Thus, the reasonable course of action would have been to do the less risky hard fork first, and segwit afterwards. (Some would argue that the early hard fork is more risky, but that's only if there is no consensus, which there indeed is not because the core devs are against it. Generally, the risks of a hard fork are better known than the risks of segwit, which introduces new concepts.)

Miner centralization is pushed by wholesale electicity prices. A large miner can buy electricity for 0.02€/kWh, whereas you are probably paying north of 0.10€/kWh. Home-mining will never again be profitable.
Furthermore, the declining number of full nodes is mainly due to emergence of wallet services like blockchain.info . End users do not need to main client any more to use Bitcoin. Note that the Lightning network will decimate the number of full Bitcoin nodes further as even fewer network participants will care about what happens underneath. If you want the number of full nodes to increase, you need to increase the number of Bitcoin users in general. And for that, you need larger blocks.

Just extrapolating the current bandwidth and storage use of my own node. Bandwidth-wise, my node at home could even handle 100 MB blocks (I have 100 MBit/s symmetric bandwidth, which amounts to 6 GB per 10 minutes when saturated). However, I would be afraid of hitting disk and CPU limits soon, so 10 MB is the conservative choice for now, also considering that others are less fortunate with their connections.
Anyway, Bitcoin still is not version 1.0, which provides the freedom to do experiments. Why not boldly increasing block size to a high value and see what happens? If node counts drop too dramatically, one could still switch back to a safe value. Generally, it is much safer to do many small steps than rare big steps.

Also much more important than block size is the price of electricity, which can vary a lot between locations.
@_date: 2015-12-27 07:20:37
No extrapolation is necessary. The technology to handle 8 GB blocks is already available (although not widespread) today.
* Bandwidth needed to handle 8 GB blocks is about 100 MBit/s (or say 1 GBit/s to account for overhead and to be on the safe side). This is a lot, but then again I already have a 100 MBit connection at my home.
* Storage requirements are harder to meet. With 8 GB blocks, we could expect about 70 TB of transaction data per year. With the mentioned improvments, that comes down to 1 TB per year. Still a lot, but perfectly feasible already today with a large hard drive.
* CPU bounds pose a bigger problem. Validating a signature takes about 2 ms on a modern CPU, allowing to validate 500 transactions per second on a single core. Fortunately, this work can be easily parallelized, allowing 20 cores to validate the necessary 10'000 transactions per second in parallel. Whereas modern consumer-grade CPUs have about 8 cores, I find it a reasonable assumption that having dozens of cores is quite common in a few years. Nvidia already produces processors with 192 cores.
--&gt; The 8 GB limit does not require the exponential trend to go on much longer. All that's needed is a better proliferation of existing technology.

For price swings to matter, Bitcoin would need to raise to 100'000 USD in value at least. As long as they stay below that, you can define 1 Satoshi = 1 cent. Yes, there is some extra cost to buy the necessary Bitcoins to color, but that's much cheaper than the cost of the paper when issuing physical cash.


That's not a feature, that's a problem. A single server is always also a single point of failure. Also, if it is controlled by the central bank, innovation will most likely be very slow. Whereas if you build on the Bitcoin blockchain, you benefit whenever someone invests in it, for example blockchain.info having raised 30 million this week in order to make Bitcoin more customer friendly.
Instead of spending money on securing your single server - which is not exactly cheap either if done seriously - you should better opt for the Bitcoin variant and invest in increased security there, for example by running an own mining pool.
I'm convinced that in the long run, open ledgers will win as opposed to ledgers that are controlled by a single entitiy.

Das Dokument des Bundesministeriums für Finanzen ist zwar unglücklich und bestätigt genau das Schreckensszenario, doch als Verwaltungserlass hat es keinen rechtssetzenden Charakter. Wenn der EUGH zum gleichen Schluss kommen würde, wäre das tatsächlich sehr ungünstig für Bitcoin. Doch wäre diese keine vernünftige Entscheidung und führt bei genauerer Betrachtung zu zahlreichen Problemen um Zusammenhang mit dem Vorsteuerabzug, der dann ebenfalls möglich wäre.
Die Urproduzentenregel gilt leider nur für die Landwirtschaft, hier hatte ich was falsch verstanden. Hingegen gibt es die Regel des fiktiven Vorsteuerabzugs (so wird dieser zumindest in der Schweiz bezeichnet, aber in Deutschland müsste es was analoges geben). Der sagt, dass wenn jemand nicht steuerpflichtiges einen gebrauchten Gegenstand an ein Unternehmen liefert, dass dann das Unternehmen einen fiktiven Vorsteuerabzug geltend machen kann. Das heisst, bei einem Verkaufspreis von 119€ kann die Privatperson alle 119€ behalten aber das Unternehmen 19€ zurückfordern. Da der fiktive Vorsteuerabzug nur für Gegenstände gilt, müsste man den Handel aber über das Verschicken von Paperwallets abwickeln.
Bei genauerer Betrachtung wird auch der EUGH auf solche Probleme aufmerksam werden und daher vermutlich entscheiden, dass bei Bitcoin keine Mehrwertsteuer anfällt. Der Bundesrat in der Schweiz hat übrigens unabhängig von dieser Überlegung gefolgert, dass Bitcoins weder Waren noch Dienstleistungen darstellen [3.3.1 c)]( Demzufolge wird auch keine Mehrwertsteuer fällig.
Insgesamt soll das keine Entwarnung sein. Natürlich ist die Antwort des EUGH wichtig, aber wir sollten auch nicht in Panik verfallen. Es ist zu hoffen, dass der EUGH sich gleich mehr Zeit nimmt, das ganze durchzudenken und zu verstehen, als das deutsche Bundesministerium für Finanzen.

Actually, one major factor of price-building is that it currently is not so scarce, with 3600 new coins mined every day. At current prices, this means that every day, 2 million USD need to flow into Bitcoin just to sustain the price. Even if half of the newly mined coins are hoarded, we still need 300 million per year of inflows going straight to the miners and from there to the electricity bill. I doubt that we will see much higher prices (e.g. 5000 USD) before 2016, when the mining rate is halfed again.
Or seen from this side: we pay the miners 3600 coins per day to process 100'000 transactions. That's 20 USD per transaction! This is not sustainable in the long run.

You are right that people would still have lost money on MtGox. People would probably even have lost money on exchanges that never came to existence. The theory is that if there would be more exchanges and thus more competition and customer choice, that this would make it more likely that an informed customer can find a safe and well-run exchange. However, even if you do not believe in this argument and you believe that all those additional exchanges would be as bad as MtGox, there would still be reduced risk. Risk-wise, it is much better to have 10 MtGox-like exchanges with one of them failing every year than to have one exchange that fails every ten years.
Also note that this is in no way an excuse for MtGox's behaviour. Also, it obviously does not help the victims. This discussion merely tries to find the optimal level of regulation for future customers. My feeling is that there is too much regulation. If you think there should be more, it would be interesting to know what kind of additional regulation you have in mind.

Firstly, this assumption is not so random. It is a continuation of what was observable in the past 18 months or so. Obviously, it will stop once production costs reaches market value, as you state here (except that you say "always" even though production cost has considerably lagged behind market value in the past):


Once this equilibrium is reached, miners will have to immediately sell most of their mined coins to cover their costs. Thus, about 3600 mined coins per day will hit the market, which will lead to declining prices unless this is offset by an according inflow of about 2 million USD per day (at current prices). And that's what I've been saying from the beginning, if you read carefully.

The problem with going to trial is that under American law, they would already have to suffer harsh consequences from the start of the trial, before any judge had any say in it, perverting the fundamental right of being treated as "innocent until proven guilty". Under US law, it is a legal risk for other banks to maintain business relations with banks that are accused of severe crimes. Thus, if BNP chose the trial, they would have risked being excluded from USD-clearing from day one - a risk no sane manager would take. This is why the US legal system is indeed very broken in such cases and why the economist is rightly calling this extortion.

This is not the case in a world with Colored Coins, where the user can choose which counterparties are acceptable and which are not. Note that even Bitcoin is not without counterparty risk: if you buy something, there is always a risk that the counterparty does not deliver.

How about the hash rate having grown more than 10-fold in the past six months while the exchange rate has fallen? Do you think that should all be attributed to better mining rigs? Also, the miners I am aware of currently operate at a nice margin. How does that fit your picture?
I agree that cost = price is the natural state. However, for the reasons given above I think that the hash rate is still lagging behind and that the amount of Bitcoins sold daily will increase as it catches up.

Edit: just talked to my wife about this. She is very confident that the scenario everyone is afraid of won't happen, because it would have various adverse effects for the tax authorities. I can go into further detail if desired, but it is pretty twisted. :)
In particular, it would have the following consequence: assuming a VAT rate of 19%, if you as an individual (who is not obliged to pay VAT) sell 1 Bitcoin for 119€ to an exchange, the exchange could get a 19€ VAT refund from the tax authorities, but you could keep all the 119€. ("fiktiver Vorsteuerabzug" in Switzerland, not sure how it is called in English.)

This is misleading as the bet is in Bitcoins. Betting 1 Bitcoin and winning yields 1.1 Bitcoins worth maybe 660 USD. Betting an losing leads to a loss of a Bitcoin worth 2000 USD. So in USD-terms, the return is more like 60:2000 or 3%.

Still, at current prices, it leads to miners given 2 million USD worth of Bitcoins per day. Assuming the hash rate continues its exponential growth, we will reach a point in time where most of those 2 million USD will be spent on electricity and the miners forced to sell 90% of the mined coins. That's why I predict that we won't see significantly higher prices until the reward rate is reduced.

Furthermore, acceleration is not worth much if you can't drive at 200km/h for more than an hour (Tesla's range collapses at high speeds). There's a good reason why Tesla isn't competing in Nascar, formula one, or any of the other racing contest. It wouldn't win.

Just to let you know, all these "memes" have a core of truth:
* Segwit is significantly more complex than a block size increase (at least when measured with traditional metrics from software engineering such as lines of code)
* Segwit requires more testing than a block size increase, so doing the more complex change first feels kind of rushed. Also, the average block size has already increased significantly over the past years without causing major issues.
* The previous hard fork ([BIP 50]( went through without problems
This is not about "antagonism" and "power", to most core supporters this is about a honest concern, namely that Bitcoin stops growing due to a completely artificial limit.
Note regarding BIP 50: I do not mean the unintentional hard fork in March 2013, which is often referred to. I mean the orderly update from 0.7 to **0.8.1** in August 2013, which forced the old 0.7 off the network as these old nodes did not support transactions with too many inputs. This is in accordance with Peter Todd's definition of a hard fork, namely that "a previously disallowed behaviour is allowed", thereby forcing old nodes off the network. Still, Peter Todd argues that the 0.8.1 update was not a hard fork due to the following technicality: the 0.7 nodes still had a slight chance of processing the new blocks as the error appeared non-deterministically. So the old nodes were not all forced off the network immediately, but only over time. To say that this does not qualify as a hard fork is extremely nit-picky, if not wrong. For all intents and purposes, it was a hard fork, cleanly and successfully executed.

That's simply wrong. Cost is just one factor of many. It is not even the most important one. The most important one is the popularity of Bitcoin. For example, it is much cheaper to run nodes for most altcoins (simply because there are fewer transactions), so according to you, they should have much more nodes, which they do not.

@_date: 2016-01-24 11:51:50
The number of people running a full node (what you probably mean by decentralization) does not only depend on the cost of running that node (i.e. block size), but also on the benefits of doing so and the number of users in total. For example, if 2% of users run a full node at 1 MB, but only 1% of users run one at 8 MB, we would still have twice as much decentralization with 8 MB blocks because the network can support four times as many users.

It certainly is a mid-point, but not a reasonable one. Have you ever used a multisig transaction?
@_date: 2017-03-31 07:41:04


You mean because it takes longer to transfer a block? For someone mining in a pool, this should not make a difference. One could also argue that bigger blocks lead to more mining income, attracting additional miners. Also, if total total fees per block are higher, the stakes are higher, and thus also the opportunity costs of attacking the network (i.e. the forgone profits of using one's computing power for an attack instead of proper mining).

Please explain what is wrong with the following reasoning:
1. There is a block size at which total fees per block are maximized. That size must be above zero and below unlimited.
2. If that optimal block size from point 1 is above 1 MB, an increase in the block size leads to higher fees per block.
3. Higher fees per block increase the income of the miners.
4. If the miner have more income, more will be invested in mining hardware, increasing the hash rate.
5. The higher the total hash rate, the more expensive it is to attack the Bitcoin network for an outside attacker.

There is, by trial and error. Increase it and decrease it step by step until the sweet spot is found. This is akin to find the right price to sell a product in order to maximize profits.


The miners collectively by signaling their preferred size. Chosing the block size to maximize fee revenue is in their own interest, so they will do that to the best of their ability.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:56:31
All these additional proposals do not increase the block size. I would just feel much more comfortable if I knew what their medium term plans are (if they have any). We will hit the ceiling very soon, even with segwit and all what you mentioned above.
I am worried that their plan is to ignore calls for a block size increase until Lightning is ready, which can take years to happen. By then, an altcoin with more capacity might have taken most of the market share.
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:11:35

That's nonsene. The [hard fork of 2013]( had a grace period of four months. People had plenty of time to update before the old chain was disconnected.

It's rarely wise to act in anger.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:46:33
Blockstream and its core devs recognize that Bitcoin's scalability is limited. Their solution is the Lightning Network, which scales much better. In the long run, this makes sense. However, in the short run, there are unconfirmed transactions piling up. In my opinion, the reasonable thing to do would be to moderately increase the block size in order to buy time until the Lightning network (or a similar solution) is ready. 
Edit: By moderately, I mean more than the proposed conditional 1.75 MB by Segwit.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:32:41
It was an immediate hardfork on that day in March 2013, but it was also rolled back within hours as the miners who had the new version switched back to the old one on that day. Then, Gavin created an update that would be able to cope with these very large transactions, but did only accept them after a period of four month. If you read the [bottom comment on this page]( you'll see that the update finally got activated in August. At that point in time, all the nodes who did not update yet got disconnected. That is the hard fork I am referring to.
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:52:22
You mean like Gavin who intensely tested blocks up to 20 mb and concluded that Bitcoin can handle them? 
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:01:38
According to the official [Lightning Network presentation]( they will need about 133 MB blocks to serve the whole world. This is in the same order of magnitude.
So there might not be an official BIP yet, but if Bitcoin wants to be a global cash system, it certainly needs blocks in that range even with efficiency boosters like Lightning.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:46:16
Segregated witness increases the effective limit to about 1.6 MB. That corresponds to maybe half a year of growth, and then we will face the same problem again. Jumping to 10 MB or so would be wiser.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:01:15
In a free market, the price is where supply and demand meets. You are right that RBF allows a better adjustment of demand. However, as long as the supply side (the maximum number of transactions per second) is fixed, we will not have a free market price. For the correct market price to form, both supply and demand must be able to adapt to market forces, and not only the demand side.
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:03:55

@_date: 2016-01-23 10:51:21
The permanent fix for the March 2013 issue is described in [BIP50]( As you can see in the bottommost comment, the August update forced the old (buggy) nodes off the network. This is exactly the definition of a hard fork: an update that is incompatible with some older version of Bitcoin, thus forcing it off the main network.
Note that some core devs argue that this was not a hard fork because the bug it fixed did not occur deterministically. Consequently, the old nodes did not disconnect immediately, but only over time. These core devs argue that the definition of "hard fork" only applies if all old nodes are disconnected immediately (e.g. on the first occurence of something that was previously not supported, and not on the second or third occurence). But for all intents and purposes, it was a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-01-10 17:16:12
I once was subject to such a work contract myself, so I know what I am talking about.

Gavin wrote: "On 16 August, 2013 block 252,451 was accepted by the main network, forking unpatched nodes off the network." This is in accordance with Peter Todd's definition of a hard fork, namely that "a previously disallowed behaviour is allowed", thereby forcing old nodes off the network. Peter argues that technically, the old nodes still had a slight chance of processing these blocks as the error appeared non-deterministically. So the old nodes were not all forced off the network immediately, but only over time. To say that this does not qualify as a hard fork is extremely nit-picky, if not wrong.
However, what matters in the end, is that what happend on August 16 was for all intents and purposes equivalent to a scheduled hard fork - even if you refuse to call it that way.
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:01:51


From the point of view of an attacker, it is actually a 4MB bump, as that is the maximum size a specially crafted block can reach. I.e. that's how much needs to be tested to be confident about releasing segwit.
@_date: 2016-01-26 10:50:10


Good to know, I was not aware about Elements Alpha. For the protocol: I like Segwit, in particular because it improves malleability. However, I would be much more comfortable if there also was a block size increase on the core roadmap and I cannot get rid of the hunch that there might be political reasons at play.


Good, so we agree on this point. The answer to "was there a hard fork" depends on how strictly the definition of hard fork is interpreted.
Btw: here is the hard fork definition from bitcoin wiki: "a change to the system which is not backwards compatible. Everyone needs to upgrade or things can go wrong." To me, it looks like BIP 50 meets that definition. But I also see that it is not the exact same situation as today.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:00:10
Yes, fees are required. The question the miners have to ask themselves is: what's the optimal block size to maximize total fees per block? If blocks are too small, fee income is low because there are too few transactions. If blocks are too large, fee income is low because the fee per transaction falls towards zero. The optimum is somewhere in between. But as long as the block size is hardcoded, we won't be able to reliably find it out where the optimum is.
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:08:52
To be fair, the core devs do seem to get some of the economics wrong. For example, a larger blockchain could increase security by increasing miner income and thus also the computing power that secures Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:28:32
A good metric might be independent node count. So if you run 10 nodes on the same machine, that should only be counted as one. Unfortunately, this is hard to detect from the outside.

You are interpreting a lot into what he said (because he wasn't very specific). Maybe he has Colored Coins in mind, in which case your critique does not apply.

@_date: 2016-01-29 15:05:37
Regardless of how slowly we move towards the 133 MB, it would help businesses a lot if the core devs could publish a medium term schedule for capacity increases, thereby removing uncertainty. For example, should the CTO of [Takara]( be worried about Bitcoin being able to support his use case in future and better move to an altcoin or a centralized solution? A stable foundation is key to build a Bitcoin-based economy and it would help greatly if entrepreneurs could plan more reliably with regards to their capacity requirements.

Good point. A free market price is where supply and demand meet. At the moment, Bitcoin only has a variable demand while the supply is decided by a committee instead of market forces. The resulting price/fee therefore is not a "free market price".

Marketingwise, pushing users towards other solutions is stupid as long as the preferred long-term solution for microtransactions (Lightning) is not ready. In the worst case, users will switch to altcoins. Instead, the core-devs should kick the can down the road for two more years and increase the blocksize accordingly (e.g. to 8 MB). Once a good solution for microtransactions is ready, they can become more restrictive. Note that this is a pure marketing view.

@_date: 2016-01-15 19:56:25
The only reason the SegWit proposal includes a limited blocksize increase is to provide an incentive for its adoption and to make it an easier sell to the community. The main advantage of SegWit is reduced malleability, which enables certain high-level services such as payment channels. It is indeed orthogonal to the blocksize increase. Also note that the blocksize-increase of SegWit does not help old transactions, it only helps new SegWit-style transactions.

No, they are pushing for a plan to increase the block size beyond what Segwit proposes. 90% of the disgruntled redditors would already be happy if the core devs put a hard fork to increase the block size on their roadmap for 2017.




The lie is in the second part: "This means some users will have to lose money to restore Bitcoin to a single chain." If done carefully, no one will lose money, just like in 2013. Also, they knowingly skip the fact that a planned hard fork leaves plenty of time for preparations. Losing money due to such a hard fork is as likely as losing money due to sending Bitcoins to an invalid address. It can happen, but if can also easily be prevented.
@_date: 2016-01-29 13:57:06
According to the official [Lightning Network presesentation]( 133 MB blocks are needed in the long run. So, no, a 70% capacity increase is not enough. It only buys us about six months of time at current growth rates.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:58:27
The SegWit increase is in fact smaller. Using typical transactions, it allows for an increase of about 60%, but only if everyone adapts SegWit. Transactions created by old-school clients do not benefit from the "increase".
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:33:09
Decentralization is indeed a very vague argument without further specification. For example, if you use independent full node count as a measure, the most important driver of decentralization is not the cost of  running a full node, but the popularity of Bitcoin. If cost was the only relevant factor, the less congested altcoins should all be more decentralized than Bitcoin, which is clearly not the case. The best way to make Bitcoin resilient against all sorts of attacks, is to ensure it stays popular.
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:47:17


There is actually more to it than just that one change. But generally, I prefer small changes with a big impact than big changes with a small impact.


I'll slightly change my statement: if developers want their software to be used, they need to understand its use cases. Also, if they actively prevent Bitcoin from being used in the way it was advertised (namely as an Internet currency that is cheaper and more convenient than credit cards), they are bound to create a lot of disappointment.
Bitcoin is different from other open source projects. If you disagree with certain things in Linux, you can simply create your own copy and modify it, as many have done before. But if you do the same to Bitcoin, you get an altcoin. So even though Bitcoin is open source, its users don't really have the freedom to adjust it, they have to accept whatever the "consensus" is. This makes Bitcoin more susceptible to disputes than other FOSS projects that are easier to fork, and it also means that the core devs must act more responsibly than the typical FOSS maintainers.
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:13:38
You can find some information about it on the [dev mailing list](
However, in my opinion, flexcap is a misguided approach. It replaces a centrally planned hard cap with a centrally planned supply function. It still wouldn't be a free market. Letting miners vote on the block size like in BIP 100 would make more sense from an economic perspective.
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:42:20
Roger addresses the decentralization worry quite well. At this point in time, most of us have heard all qualitative arguments. If we want to understand each others position better, we should try to quantify our beliefs. Decentralization, for example, is not binary. It can be defined as the number of independent nodes in the network. Is 1000 enough? Do we need 10'000? If there are too few according to this metric, should we decrease the max block size? How should technical progress enter the equation? At what point should fees considered to be too high? Once we have metrics, the debate becomes much less emotional. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 08:54:29
Yes, the limit would have to be specified in Bitcoin, e.g. the mentioned 0.001 BTC. That would already help, even if the real-world value fluctuates. Note that Bitcoin tends to get less and less volatile over time, so this will be less of an issue in the future than it is today. Also, if it is possible to introduce such a limit, it should also be possible to adjust it from time to time.
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:33:27
Yes, there's also a nice presentation here: 
It seems like the mining pools are much faster (only two seconds or so at average) at getting the latest blocks than the typical full nodes, and that's what matters the most.

That's not the same, and you know it. Increasing the cap from 21 million to 22 million dilutes the value of all the existing coins. Increasing the block size does not dilute the usefulness of your transactions. In fact, it increases the usefulness of Bitcoin thanks to Metcalfe's law.

Also, politics takes time.


From their FAQ: "The programme is aimed at larger sponsors. We do not have a mechanism for the general public to donate at this time."
Furthermore, they did not even list "block size increase" among the 28 example projects that can be sponsored. There is only "research and on how to do a hard fork safely" even though there have been hard forks before (in Bitcoin and other blockchains) and "flexicap blocksize", which is in my opinion the wrong approach as it only replaces a centrally planned hard cap with a centrally planned supply function. BIP 100 would be much better.
So even if they would allow me to sponsor "small" amounts like 1000 USD, I still could not sponsor the project I feel is most urgent right now.


Relative to the block size increase, almost everything is overprioritized. To name specific items from your list:


This "feature" is a pure political powerplay. The core devs already today have too much power, and this "feature" would provide them with the option of going nuclear. Not good at all. There would be way too much fallout if it was ever used.


If that's what I think it is, then the only benefit of this "feature" is to provide false hope to users that are unwilling to pay high fees. It's like saying "everyone can be a millionaire, just go to the casino with a backpack full of luck".


This however, would be great! Maybe the best feature in your list.

Yes, but it also assumes that these persons only make two transactions per day (how many emails per day do you write?) and that they keep their payment channels open for about a year, which are two rather conservative assumptions. In any case: my point is that even the LN authors believe that the block size could be increased at some point in time. It won't automatically destroy the network, as some seem to believe here.
@_date: 2016-06-29 09:33:45

The plain block-size increase is the original path envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. Also, it is simpler (it takes fewer lines of code to implement), and simplicity is an invaluable asset in software engineering. Furthermore, core treats the Chinese miners like s***, ridiculing the Hong Kong agreement, ignoring their ideas, and even contemplating a change in pow algorithm which would make their investments worthless.

Majority hash power can also perform a 51% attack and exclude all the other miners completely.


Hash power and the size of the blocks you can process is completely independent, i.e. the point at which the profitability is maximized (i.e. where the sum of all fees in a block is maximal) is the same for all miners, regardless of their cost structure. So the small miners will have perfectly aligned interests with the big miners.
Here's an shortcut to see this: setting the block size is an indirect way of setting fees. (The larger the blocks, the lower the average fee.) So let's say income per block is maximized at 1 MB with a fee of 1$ per transaction and 1000 transactions per block, resulting in 1000$ per block. Let's further say 0.9 MB blocks would lead to 1.1$ fees and 1.1 MB blocks would lead to 0.9$ fees. In that case, 0.9 MB blocks would yield 900\*1.1 = 990$ and 1.1MB blocks would yield 1100\*0.9=990$ per block. In this example, income is maximized by having 1 MB block and no miner has an incentive to deviate from that, regardless of the efficiency of his mining equipment.

This is indeed the simplest adjustment method that yields a reasonable result. Economically, the voting allows the miners to form a cartel and charge monopoly prices (i.e. the price that maximizes the miners' total profits). This is already much better than having a fixed supply like in Bitcoin, but prices will still be higher than under competition (which wouldn't be a good idea anyway due to externalities).

Blocks would still be full with Segwit. It provides a relatively small increase that only is actually made use of over time, as more users start using Segwit transactions.

The technically interesting action currently clearly is with Ethereum, see for example Vitalik's latest [thoughts on sharding]( Personally, I prefer their approach of growing by repeatedly taking risks, falling, and getting back on their feet again. But there is a place for both, Bitcoin as stable "digital gold" and other coins as platforms for smart contracts and all the other innovation. Or as Andreas Antonopoulos said it, Bitcoin and Ethereum are not competitors in the same space, just like the tiger and the shark.

Thanks, that was eye-opening. If I understand you correctly, you would disagree with the "133 MB blocks" mentioned in the [original presentation of lightning network]( (slide 51)?
So far, I always assumed that refusing a hard fork was just politics to generate demand for lightning network as the plan was to eventually lift the limit anyway. But if you are right, the 133 MB of the lightning network presentation should not be taken too seriously and the actual plan is to try to make things work with just 1 MB blocks + segwit. And if that leads to an inability to scale to Visa levels, you are happy with Bitcoin being "digital gold" and another - less immutable - cryptocurrency taking the market for everyday payments? Basically, you would be fine with abandoning the vision of Bitcoin as electronic cash ([for example mentioned here]( if realizing that vision means to compromise on immutability?

The business model of coinbase was created under the assumption that the block size will be increased early and often.

Some people (e.g. Roger Ver) have invested a significant portion of their savings in companies whose business plan only works out if Bitcoin transactions stay cheap (i.e. less than ten cents).

@_date: 2015-08-22 14:10:22
The problem with BIP 100 is its downwards bias. 21% of the hashing power suffices to trigger a decrease, whereas it takes 81% for an increase. It would be better to bias against change. I.e. take the minimum of the middle 60% to trigger an increase, and the maximum of the 60% to trigger a decrease.

@_date: 2015-08-17 18:12:02
Bitcoin XT actually implements a rather conservative approach. Running it won't have any effect at all until January 2016, and even then, a 75% majority is needed. At the moment, running Bitcoin XT is a way of demonstrating that you support an increase of the block size sooner rather than later. If someone gives me a client that implements a better solution, I have still plenty of time to switch.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:26:05
I acknowledge that doing this the right way is non-trivial. What I find astonishing is the lack on consensus that the Bitcoin network should be able to handle a significantly larger number of transactions than it does today, even though this is clrearly what Satoshi envisioned.

A blocksize of 2 MB by 2020 is not a significant increase. Yet that's what one of the core devs suggests.
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:49:41


In that case, the solution is to pay higher fees, and not to artificially limit the number of transactions per block.
To be more specific: if there are too many SPV miners, transactions with low fees won't be processed any more. Thus, people will need to increase their fees, making normal mining preferrable again. A tight block-size limit would even be counter-productive in such a scenario as it reduces the amount of fees per block given a certain average fee per transaction.
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:43:19
I'm not sure you understood what worries me.
For example, if block size is 4 mb an 79% vote for an increase, while 21% votes for a decrease, BIP 100 says it must be decreased to 2 mb even though it is only a small minority who wants to do so.
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:56:57
The problem with this BIP is that it introduces a 21% attack vector:


20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen.
In other words: 20% of mining power is enough to lower the block size limit. Furthermore, BIP 100 does not specify a minimum. Thus, anyone controlling at least 20% of mining power could force a *decrease* of the block size, i.e. to 128 kB within one year, thereby dramatically damaging the usability of Bitcoin. 21% of hashing power would suffice to perform this attack.
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:41:01
This approach is not limited to a 2x increase. Also, it is the least risky option thanks to its simplicity. Here is how it would be implemented:
1. Patch the core to accept blocks up to e.g. 16 MB.
2. Once this version is widely used, miners can start to actually produce larger blocks.
3. Repeat in future if necessary.
@_date: 2015-08-18 04:59:34


If true, that would be a symptom of total fees per block being too low. This could be addressed by increasing fees per transaction or transactions per block.

Time alone suffice if you are confident that everyone agrees on the change. If you can't be sure about that, it makes sense to require a majority of mining power to stand behind the change in addition to the time condition.

If the hard drive consumes 9W of power and 1kWh costs 0.20$, it costs you less than 16$ to run a 2000 GB drive for one year. That's 0.04$ for 5 GB per year. Bandwidth is a little more expensive. Assuming those 5 GB are transferred 10 times, that amounts to 50 GB of bandwidth which costs 5 USD at Amazon EC2 rates of 0.09$/GB, which are rather high (hetzner for example charges less than a tenth of that).
Thus, including the cost of the hard drive, storing those 5 GB for 50 years will cost less than 10$ at today's prices, namely 2.5$ + 50*0.04$+5$ = 9.50$.

The problem with planned caps is that changing them is extremely political. It is better to have a well-defined process to adjust them than a toxic discussion going on for years.
@_date: 2016-02-24 16:58:51
The answer is no because there is no need to adjust money supply. Here, the risk of doing nothing is zero. However, with the block size, doing nothing poses considerable risks. In the end, it is about finding the path forward that has the highest chances of success.
@_date: 2016-02-05 14:22:37
That's what defines a true statement. Anyone can make it without lying. The question is, would any core dev make that statement today? I guess not because it does not suit everyone's political agenda.
@_date: 2016-02-24 13:48:36
Yes, money supply is also arbitrary. But unlike block size, it does not hurt usability as Bitcoins can be split into very small amounts, thereby providing a natural way of scaling to a larger user base. A limited block size, however, imposes limits on Bitcoin's use, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Also, note that Satoshi provided clear rules for how the long-term money supply adjusts, whereas the 1 MB block size limit was created as a temporary fix to address spamming in the early network. Prior to that 1 MB limit, Satoshi actually had a 32 MB limit in place.
@_date: 2016-02-03 12:20:38
It is better to pro-actively plan ahead than to passively react to circumstances in a rush. Hitting the block size limit was perfectly predictable. Thus, it also made sense to schedule the block size increase early and give everyone plenty of time to update their clients. Unfortunately, a blocking minority among the core devs seem to prefer hitting that completely artificial wall to see what happens.
@_date: 2016-02-23 09:32:28
The "fee market" envisioned here actually is a planned economy, with the core devs determining supply. In an actual free market, both supply and demand can adjust and the emerging fees will be close to the marginal costs of a transaction. As long as miners cannot freely adjust supply (e.g. by voting a proposed in various BIPs), there won't be a free fee market.
@_date: 2016-02-03 13:06:36
Let's have a look at the [top three contributors](
* Wladimir J. van der Laan: "weakly against", mostly silent
* Pieter Wuille: author of a [BIP]( to increase the block size. Also stated that he would be in favor of a "one time bump"
* Gavin Andresen: clearly in favor of increasing the block size
The first two actually signed the roadmap, but I guess that's because they think that is the smallest common denominator everyone can agree on, not because it is the best possible solution. Also note the long list of supporting companies on the [bitcoin classic]( site.

A 2000 GB drive costs about 100$, so the raw storage cost of 5 GB is 2.5$. Adding bandwidth and electricity, it won't be more than 10$.

Maybe early enthusiasts are much more likely to run a full node than later adopters. Average Joe does not run his own smtp server either. The question is: can we rely on these early enthusiasts to stay? Or should we better rely on parties that have an actual economic incentive beyond enthusiasm (exchanges, miners, wallet services)? The latter group would certainly grow in size and strength as the number of users increases, even though they might only run a minority of full nodes today.

@_date: 2016-02-24 07:09:04
The free market price is where supply and demand meet. But in the "fee market" envisioned by these economically less educated core devs, only demand is allowed to adjust, while supply is artificially limited. I don't think that there will be a death spiral, but it certainly won't be a free market equilibrium.

IMO, the consensus is that in this case, Satoshis will be allowed to split up further, e.g. into microsatoshis.
I am confident that there aren't good enough arguments to justify an increase of the money supply. But if there are, it is only reasonable to consider them. After all, ignoring good arguments is the definition of ignorance.

Everyone seems to agree that there is a trade-off between decentralization and capacity. So if we want to be able to pinpoint the right balance more accurately, a clear metric is needed. Let us try to do that.
1. Capacity: this is the number of transactions per second the system can support. The higher, the better. The number of users should be roughly proportional to that.
2. Decentralization: the most popular measure seems to be the [number of full nodes]( which currently is between 5000 and 6000. The more, the better. Also, it is important that they are geographically distributed.
Greg's trade-off basically says that increasing capacity makes it more expensive to do validation, and thus fewer users will run full nodes. This argument seems very simplistic and only takes first-order effects into account. For example, let us assume that increasing capacity ten-fold (i.e. to 10 MB blocks) leads to half of all full nodes giving up. Only having 2500 full nodes left would be a clear loss. On the other hand, this would also support a 10-fold increase in the number of users. If the share of new users that runs a full node is similar to that among the old users, the influx of new users would push up the number of full nodes to 25000 again, making the capacity increase a net win for decentralization, as the number of full nodes would increase fivefold!
So even if we completely neglected capacity and only maximized decentralization, the optimal block size could be way above the current, arbitrarily chosen limit of 1 MB. It would be great if the "decentralization" crowd could back their reasoning with actual numbers and metrics. My own back-of-the-envelope calculations hint that ideal decentralization would require block sizes significantly higher than 1 MB.

If the miners act in their best economic interest, they will not let that happen in a voting system like BIP 100. I am not arguing that blocks should get infinitely large, I am arguing that there should be a mechanism in place that allows to adjust the block size in accordance with the current needs and limitations. Letting the miners vote is the best such mechanism proposed so far. Their incentives are well-aligned with the long-term success of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2011-11-13 16:08:13
This is BS. To summarize: they point out to the fact that miners are better off keeping transactions for themselves so others can't get the attached transaction fee. To resolve this, they create an elaborate scheme to incentivize forwarding transactions. The much simpler and obvious solution however is to let the originator of the transaction send the transaction to more miners. For example, when doing a transaction, you tell the top 100 miners about it so even if they refuse to forward the transaction, you can still be sure that it will be processed soon. Simple problem, simple solution.

Can you explain how selfish mining can be profitable with only 1/3 of the mining power? Immediately revealing a new block yields one block reward for sure. Mining selfishly yields two block rewards 1/3 of the time and none 2/3 of the time. Ah... I get it now. In case the others find a block first and finds out early enough, there is a chance that the own block wins by immediately revealing it. If that chance is 50%, that strategy also yields one block reward at average, and even more if you control more than 1/3.
So you are right.

Here's one reason: the value of BTC at the moment is to a large degree psychological. As such, it will suffer from psychological effects, like people being used to comparing it to the USD. This is especially true when BTC reaches parity with the USD, as many shops will say 1 BTC = 1 USD for the sake of simplicity. That's why the BTC is bound to the value of the USD within a reasonable range.
Of course, if the USD falls deep enough, shops and our brains have to readjust and to abandon the idea of parity.

That's been discussed before. Unless a pool controls more than 50% of the computing power, the incentives are to tell others about the block as fast as possible. The risk of losing the latest block by not telling others about it is bigger than the gain of "selfish mining".
The issue with SPV mining is a distinct problem and a little more subtle. In any case, it will go away in the long run as fees outgrow the block reward. The faster fees and the number of transactions grow, the sooner this is the case.

Actually, it can. Technically, it is less efficient than a centralized solution. But from a regulatory perspective, it is much more efficient than centralized solutions as much of today's regulation only applies to centralized systems.

While this is an overgeneralization (for example, the founders of Bitcoin exchange [Ecurex](ecurex.com) are economists), I think the main reason is the predefined money supply. Soon holding a master's in economics myself, I know that macroenomics is to a large degree concerned with policy-making, in particular how the central bank should set the interest rate. Without central banks, every economist trained to advice central banks becomes useless.
To be fair, economists also have a point: it can be relatively easy shown that price stability (i.e low volatility) supports economic growth. Thus, a country with a fiat currency and with a competent central bank can have a little more growth than a country with a predefined-supply currency such as Bitcoin or gold. However, Bitcoin is still better than a currency managed by an incompetent central bank.
In the end, it should be the choice of the consumers, which currency to use. Some will always prefer the currencies given to them by the government - and that's ok in a free world.

The first spike in April felt like natural speculation to me. The initial move upwards was probably triggered by the halving to 25 bitcoins per block in December 2012. That caused press attention, which led to an infow of more money, which caused higher prices and even more press attention. Bitcoin prices for that period follow google trends very closely. As a further accelerator, some miners hoarded as much as they could, having had to sell fewer an fewer coins per day to pay their electricity bills as the price went up, reducing effective supply further. The November bubble in comparison felt much more artificial to me and was probably manufactured by MtGox to a large degree through willybot. Furthermore, once people started to accept that they won't see their USD parked in MtGox any more as fewer and fewer withdrawals went through, they panic-buyed in the hope of getting at least some Bitcoin out (that's what I did).

The problem of core's roadmap is not what they have planned, it's what the haven't planned: a timely block-size increase to kick the can down the road until Lightning Network is ready. We could have twice as many users today, if it weren't for the artificial 1 MB cap. I talked to multiple core devs in person and they agreed that the network could probably bear 10 mb blocks. However, they are afraid that increasing it once will be the start of a slippery slope with users demanding even bigger increases. In other words: their main reason to oppose an increase is entirely political.

The problem with this parable is that it implies that the cost of securing the castle raises faster than the tax income from having more citizens. In reality, the opposite is the case: the length of the wall around the castle grows proportionally with the radius of the covered area, but the area itself is proportional to the square of the radius. Thus, expanding the castle to make space for more and more citizens would actually be a good deal for the king and allow him to pay more and better soldiers per meter of wall.
The same is true for Bitcoin: more users would pay more transaction fees, thereby allowing for better security. But that's something people do not like to hear in this subreddit.

I agree that 2 MB would not make a big difference. But Segwit won't actually increase the size of the blocks. It outsources some transaction data into a separate data structure, but the normal blocks themselves will still be limited at 1MB. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:28:28
Don't listen to pb1x, his explanations are more confusing than necessary. Segregated witness allows to move the signature data of transactions made with a compatible client into a separate data structure. Typically that's about 40% of the data. Thanks to a clever hack, this does not require a hard fork. The "normal" blocks are still limited to 1MB, and the additional Segwit blocks with the signature data can hold up to 4MB. In the end, this leads to a capacity increase equivalent to having about 1.7 MB blocks without Segwit. This is close to 2MB and that's why people like pb1x say Segwit will bring us 2MB blocks.

You got it wrong. Hardware capabilities (disk size, processor speed,  network throughput) do grow exponentially. Increasing block sizes as hardware improves is an exponential solution. For example, you get about 10 times more disk space per dollar today than when the 1 MB limit was introduced.

It is also worth mentioning that keeping blocks tiny is not the only way to ease centralization pressure. There are also other solutions to that problem, for example fee smoothing: instead of getting all the fees of a block, its miner only gets 10%, plus 10% of the fees of the previous 9 blocks. At average and in totaö, miners get the same as before, but mining an empty block still earns you 90% of the average fee.

Actually, such blacklists do not require a central authority. For example, I can start the "blacklist" in a decentralized way by claiming that someone stole Bitcoins from me, transferring them to address X. That way, everyone knows that those Bitcoins have been stolen (if they believe me). Furthermore, I can issue a reward if someone gives me the real identity of whoever owns that address. This provides an incentive to collect such statements, forming a black list, and to systematically check incoming transactions. If you have Bitcoin client that does that for you, it might pop up a message saying "You have just received x Bitcoins from a blacklisted address. Allegedly, they have been stolen and there is a reward for exposing the identity of the seller. Would you like to do so?".
As anyone can provide such rewards, this results in a completely decentralized blacklist. Also, everyone is free to what he wants with it.

* I doubt the market manipulation in the way he describes it adds up. A much easier way to make money with market manipulation is to enter into an agreement to buy/sell a large number of Bitcoins offline at the current MtGox price. Push the price up on Gox, sell overpriced Bitcoins offline without moving the markets. Push it down, buy cheap Bitcoins offline.

This is not an all-or-nothing. There is a middle ground. When Bitcoins get stolen, it is only natural for the victim to try to track the thief down. As a victim of a theft, you would probably look for hints in the block chain (maybe the thief is stupid enough not to launder them) and try to get information whenever some of the Bitcoins reach a known address (e.g. bitstamp). You might also want to pledge a reward for whoever can give you hints about the thief, tracking him down transaction by transaction.
This does not destroy the fungibility of Bitcoin, but it reduces the incentive to steal them (or use them in other ways that anger someone). I for one would certainly consider helping the victim in case of a theft (but not necessarily in other cases). Everyone is free to apply their own standards. If you have a problem with that approach, then I'd like to see your reaction when someone steals from you.

I don't get how money can be lost that easily. Let's say you use a new client to create a transaction. Due to some strange error, the majority of other Bitcoin nodes reject the transaction. So what? All the damage done is that your transaction could not be executed. But you still have your Bitcoin and can spend them in a new, valid transaction.
The most problematic part I see is the generation of addresses. If your client generates an address whose signature is for whatever reason not accepted by the majority of clients, these Bitcoins are in limbo until the majority of clients supports such addresses.

The real flaw of the paper is somewhere else, namely that they assume that the value of Bitcoin won't be affected by such an attack.
The details: the paper is correct in saying that a majority of miners (e.g. 60%) have an incentive to collude and to exclude all the other miners. Thereby, they can earn 100% of the transaction fees even tough they only have 60% of the computing power. The maximum they can get out of this trick is doubling their earned fees (with 50.00001% of computing power). However, I think it is safe to assume that, should this ever happen, the value of Bitcoin will fall significantly - probably much more than 50%. Thus, while the attack still pays off in BTC terms, it does not pay off any more in USD terms. Thus, the incentive to collude for such an attack goes away.

Probably not. I would guess that as a miner, the value of the BTC in EUR at the point in time you mined them is considered income. However, if you keep the BTC, the gain in value while holding them is capital gains.
I.e: You mine 1 BTC when it is 10 EUR worth. After one year, you sell it for 100 EUR. In this case, you have made 10 EUR taxable income and 90 EUR non-taxable capital gains.

Another interesting indicator is the number of bids within the range of the past hours. Currently, there are bid for about 100'000 BTC at 50 and above. All those bids must have been placed in the past two days, indicating that there is at least 5 mio USD worth of cash on MtGox that is hunting for a good opportunity to buy.
On the other side, there are 130'000 BTC that have been put up for sale since the peak (below 260). If they all changed hands now in one huge trade in exchange for the USD from the recent buy orders, matching price would probably be around 50 USD.
There are many factors that skew this analysis, including idle reserves sitting on MtGox that are not used for a bid or ask. However, assuming they neutralize, we can translate the difference between the current price of 70 USD and the matching price above into a market expectation that around 2'000'000 USD (netto) will flow into the market within a reasonable time. If you don't agree with this expectation, it is time to sell. If you think more USD will flow into MtGox, it is time to buy.

Sorry for hijacking the top comment, but there is a **very important implication** people seem to miss:
Selling Bitcoins is **not excempt from VAT**. This means that if a company sells you 1 Bitcoin for 100€, they have to charge 19% VAT on top, increasing the sales price to 119€. This could seriously impair the ability of companies to sell Bitcoins to customers. Bitcoin.de is not affected because the transactions happen between its users (i.e. like on ebay, bitcoin.de is not the actual seller).
The [relevant law]( lists "gesetzlichen Zahlungsmitteln" (i.e. the EUR or any other national currency) as exception. This means that I can sell you 1 USD without charging VAT, but I have to charge VAT when selling you 1 Bitcoin commercially.
I will check the details later with my wife - she holds a Masters degree in European VAT.

Sounds like overkill to me - at least if this is meant to be a test balloon. First, the need to find out whether there actually is demand for Bitcoin as a currency. This can be done much more easily:
* Generate a few Bitcoin addresses
* Store the public keys on your server so you can display those address to receive payments. Use a different address for each client in order to be able to identify the sender of the payment.
* Store the private keys offline on paper. Process payouts manually once per day.
This way, you can test the market without much effort. Once you reach a considerable volume, you can move up.

The discussion is about whether someone selling Bitcoins has to charge VAT (not the same as sales tax, but similar to the consumer). For example, if I sell you a silver coin, I have to chargr 19% VAT on it. However, if I sell you one USD, I don't have to charge VAT. The legal question is whether Bitcoin falls under one of the few exceptions in VAT-law.

The VAT question is extremely important for the success of Bitcoin. I think the ministry's answer was foreseeable regarding article 4 section 8 b. As long as there is no country that uses it as official currency, section 8 b does not help. However, my hope is that Bitcoin falls under section 8 d which exempts payments and transactions from VAT.

500 Bitcoins is nothing. In early 2013, MtGox regularily had sell walls of 10'000 Bitcoins and more. The amount of Bitcoins available for sale on MtGox is much smaller today (around 15'000) than a year ago (maybe 100'000).

No one said this: but the first thing to do would be to call your bank and tell them about your intent. They can tell you how they handle such cases.

As such, they will automatically care much more about you and hopefully consult you properly.

@_date: 2013-03-02 18:21:40
Somewhat simplified, this could work as follows:
* Find a way to found a company that owns e.g. 10'000 BTC and has 1'000'000 shares. 10'000 of those shares are in the hands of the founders, 990'000 shares are owned by the company itself.
* The company sells its own shares to anyone interested at a price of 1 BTC each, and buys them back again at 1 BTC each from shareholders who want to sell (+ a small fee). Generally, for each outstanding share it does not own itself, the company owns 1 BTC.
* Make an IPO. Let the company trade its own shares at the stock market as follows: whenever the price of 1 share drops below the current BTC price in USD (e.g. BTC = 35 USD, 1 Share = 32 USD on the market), the company sells 1 BTC on Mt.Gox (getting 35 USD) and buys 1 share (for 32 USD) on the stock market. If the price of a share is higher than the price of BTC, the company does the opposite.
With this system, you'll have a company that will always own as many BTC as it has outstanding shares. Thus, its book value per share is always 1 BTC. Also, shareholders can choose to exchange their shares for BTC at any time. The value of the shares on the stock market will always be very close to the current market value of BTC (within a certain spread).
This is the basic idea. There are plenty of problems with this approach. For example, it is illegal for Swiss companies to hold more than 15% of their own shares (not sure how that works in other countries). Furthermore, for an IPO, a certain percentage of the shares must be in public hands. Thus, it won't be possible to implement this exactly as described above. However, maybe there are other legal constructs with the same effect (e.g. using two distinct companies that hold each others shares). We'd need a good lawyer for that. :)

As so often, the truth is in the middle. Limited money supply prevents an economy to grow at its full potential, making Bitcoin sub-optimal in that regard; but it isn't catastrophic either. Growth will be somewhat slower than under a perfect monetary policy, but there will still be growth.

Notice that bills are sometimes tracked as well. For example, if you bring 2000$ in 20$ bills to the bank and the bank notices that they have been stolen earlier in a robbery (they carry unique numbers as you know), the police might want to ask you a few questions.
The same will happen when receiving large amounts of Bitcoins that are known to come from shady sources.

@_date: 2013-08-17 06:39:52
That's the core question. If you sell Bitcoins commercially, you have to charge 19% VAT because Bitcoin is not mentioned as an exception in [VAT law §4 section 8]( This is bad news for anyone who want to operate a Bitcoin ATM. However, as VAT in the end is only charge on the "value added" (hence value added tax), it is less horrible as it sounds. For example, if you buy 1 Bitcoin from MtGox for 100€ and sell that Bitcoin in Germany through a commercially operated ATM for 101€, you have to actually charge 101.19€ and pay 0.19€ in taxes.
(probably I'm wrong - I'll check)

Actually, this is wrong. Fungibility is not destroyed as long as you are willing to provide prove that your Bitcoins stem from a legitimate transaction. It's the same with flagged bank notes: if you notice that you have a bank note in your wallet that was flagged (e.g. it got stolen in a bank robbery), you will get a new one when reporting it to the police and telling them what you know about it.
Similarily, if you happen to own stolen Bitcoins, you could provide information about where you got it from to whoever maintains the blacklist and your address would get whitelisted. Thereby, your Bitcoins get fully fungible again.

I'm one of those. For low-margin businesses, it is currently impossible to agree to prices in Bitcoins. Instead, they calculate in USD and dynamically show how much that is in BTC. If you want BTC to become a unit of account, it must become more stable. Even for a high-margin silk road dealer, current daily volatility hurts and forces him to increase prices in order to have a safety margin. Also for investment purposes, an asset that rises between 4% and 6% per month is much more attractive than one with a monthly performance between -30% and 40%.
Short term and medium term price stability are essential for Bitcoins success and directly related to your first point, ease of use. A currency whose value fluctuates by more than 5% per day is not easy to use as one needs to constantly watch exchange rates and adapt prices.

This is excellent new. This will help Bitcoin in many ways:
* **Accessibility**: Today, it is impossible to simply call your financial adviser and tell him you want to buy 1 million worth of BTC right now. By making Bitcoins tradable with traditional online brokers (Schwab, Swissquote, Scottrade, etc), we open the gates to a much wider audience of investors.
* **Tangibility**: If BTC appears in your UBS online banking portfolio along with stocks, bonds and other securities, it will feel much more real.
* **Liquidity**: If Satoshi sells 100’000 BTC today, the market tanks. On the stock market, market makers could dampen the impact.
* **Stability**: Not only can we expect more stable prices if there is more liquidity, we can also trade on more stable, proven markets that do not suffer from lag and downtime as often as MtGox.
* **Publicity**: On most stock markets, Bitcoin would have been among the top performing stocks very often this year, making its success much more visible and bringing it onto the radar of analysts to whom only exists what has a ticker symbol.
* **Credibility**: Having BTC listed along with GOOG or NOVN would increase Bitcoin’s credibility as an investment vehicle. As a nice side effect, your bank might let you even borrow against it. Not that I would recommend that, but it would become feasible.
* **Extensibility**: Being traded on the stock market, barrier-reverse knock-out convertible ultimate return obligations and many other financial products with fancy names could be based on BTC – finally allowing the bears to short Bitcoin in large quantities.
* **Familiarity**: Listed shares are a well-known legal construct people like your accountant know how to deal with. Paper wallets are not.

1'000'000 per Bitcoin leads to a total market cap of 21 trillion. This is ten times as much as the money supply of the US Dollar ([source]( or about three times as much as all gold ever mined. In other words: Bitcoin needs to get ten times as successful as the current global reserve currency.
(Yes, due to fractional reserve, there are actually "more" dollars in circulation (M3). However, it is also possible to have fractional reserve with Bitcoins (i.e. a bank owing all its customers together 1000 Bitcoins but actually having only 100 while the other 900 are lent out to others). Thus, comparing to M1 comes closest to comparing apples with apples.)

Thanks for your reply. Here is my back-of-the-envelope calculation:
There are many 1000 CHF notes in circulation outside Switzerland. Apparently, they are not used for payments but as a store of wealth. It is less popular than gold, but still amounts to about 20 billion USD which is stored that way. Assuming Bitcoin can reach similar popularity as a store of wealth as Swiss 1000 CHF bills, this would imply a target price of 1000 USD - neglecting other use cases.
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:27:26
I think this is a very optimistic way to put it. It means that if you pay with Bitcoins, you pay the same price as you normally would (i.e. price + VAT) and that there is no extra charge for accepting Bitcoin.
However, this is only half the truth. Probably, the tax commissioner would look at it as if you paid with potatoes (and not a currency, as Bitcoins is not a currency from a VAT-law perspective). But if you pay for stuff using potatoes at a commercial scale, you need to start charging VAT on that (because the other party is getting potatoes, which you must charge VAT on when selling). This is no problem as long as you use Bitcoin for small personal purchases, but probably it is for a company that regularily buys goods for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-02 08:07:50
The situation in Switzerland is similar. At least 1 million initial investment, 5 mio. after one year or it gets closed. Also, etf must consist of other already accepted assets (listed stocks, options, gold).

This is not a technical problem, it is a legal one. Trading stolen goods is a crime in most countries (fencing). If I can prove that you own stolen Bitcoins (e.g. because you sent me a few from a stolen source) and report you to the police, the police can seize those Bitcoins. If you fail to comply or if you cannot nicely explain how you got them, you will be in trouble.
That's why I would not recommend to accept Bitcoins from shady sources and to follow the know-your-customer rule.

It only works under the assumption that people are happy with keeping some of their Bitcoins in bank accounts (instead of wallets they directly control). Imagine you being a Bitcoin bank actually owning 100 Bitcoins. Now someone wants a  credit of 1000 Bitcoins from you. You say: "sure, here you are", and increase the amount of Bitcoins in the borrowers account by 1000 Bitcoins. Of course, if the borrower wants to cash out, you go bust. But he does not and buys a house with those 1000 Bitcoins instead, instructing you to transfer the 1000 Bitcoins from his account to the sellers account, who happens to also have an account with you. Now, the borrower has successfully bought a house with 1000 Bitcoins that do not really exist. You as a bank have two clients, one that owes you 1000 Bitcoins and one that you owe 1000 Bitcoins to. Now imagine that there are thousands of customers. The chances that they all want to cash out are pretty slim. Thus, you get away with handing out more Bitcoins than you actually own and you make a shitton of money thanks to the differences in interest rates (i.e. you charge 5% from the borrower, but only give 3% to the seller of the house and keep 2% per year for yourself). That's how banks work.

If you read carefully, they say that §4 section 8 b does not exempt the sale of Bitcoins from VAT. However, that section only exempts legal tender. The much more relevant section is 8 d, which says that transactions and payments are exempt from VAT. Consider that technically, the EUR in your bank account are not legal tender (only physical bank notes and coins are). So not even the EUR in your bank account fall under section 8 b. Instead, payments from your bank account are exempt from VAT thanks to section 8 d, which I hope also applies to Bitcoins.
I intend to get a tax ruling on this (at least for Switzerland whose relevant section of VAT law is basically copied and pasted from Germany). I will meet with an influential Swiss VAT expert on September 19th to see if I could obtain one from Switzerland for the Bitcoin foundation.

Actually, it requires only a fraction of merchants to refuse them to have an effect. Assume that 5% of all merchants do not accept known stolen Bitcoins. In that case, even if you don't care yourself, you start preferring clean Bitcoins because you might want to sell them to someone who might want to buy something from those 5% merchants. That way, already a small minority can have an impact.
Furthermore, as soon as it is possible to find out that a given Bitcoin was stolen, it might become legally dangerous to accept it. Knowingly accepting stolen money is considered money-laundering in many countries.
Therefore, such a registry could have a huge impact.
