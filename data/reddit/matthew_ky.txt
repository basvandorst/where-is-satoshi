I misread your post, it seemed that you were equating 'all of 13 items' with a failed project.
The site is not precious to me. However, I'm tired of so many people engaging in tribalism and not even taking a look at alternatives before writing them off. I have been using OB, even listed something for sale. 
It keeps crashing for me, and my listing is gone for some reason, I must be doing something wrong.

This may seem like a huge waste of time and tax money, which it is, if you think the objective is to stop crime. It's about power, and keeping you subjugated. Then it makes perfect sense, in that context.

The marketing budget is strong with this one...
Seriously though, other (and better) decentralized crypto marketplaces have been around for a while.

Have any of you checked out FreeMarket? It is completely decentralized as well, with listings stored on-blockchain, and has been running well since September 2014.
  is a pass thru website to the service, it's simply a server running the freemarket software in the background. You are encouraged to run it yourself of course! That's what makes it decentralized. :)
Also, you can pay with multiple currencies, including BTC and now USD.

So true. I wish someone had explained this to me when I was in 8th grade. When people do not understand something you are passionate about, they will do everything they can to bring you down and criticize you. It's a shame, you just have to keep your head up.

Bitcoin Classic is proposing to let a majority of miners steal any coins they want as well?
Who else is doing that? Core???

Any usage of 'too' instead of 'to' renders the whole sentence null for me. Seriously, it's not that difficult.

Love gold and bitcoin, see them as analog and digital complements. Bitcoin is great, but I don't see it ever fully replacing holding physical gold. Also, silver is great too!

Do you still have to maintain 100% uptime on your node to keep your store online?

What about taxes

Haven't looked at the mining calculators lately, but I'd say the chances are mighty slim.
If you are in the USA, you will have to buy not only the miners, but you'll also have to have 220V outlets for the Bitmain miners, or do all the wiring yourself like I did, only to have them killed by a storm one night. Make sure you use a power strip...

Just a reminder that FreeMarket has been available since Fall 2014.
nxtfreemarket.com --&gt; official site
freemarketlite.com --&gt; passthru site, you can buy/sell items here without downloading the software
Uses Nxt, but can support BTC, BTCD, LTC via shapeshift.

If the banks are penalized, who will get the money? Not the working class, that's for sure. The govt. will pocket it and the cycle will continue.
Call it 'the cost of doing business'

Google around for a tax accountant who specializes in bitcoin. You must declare your gains for the year. If you can't establish a clear cost basis, which many in crypto cannot, you may have to use a 0 cost basis. (i.e. your gains came from a dirt cheap ico and made 10000x gains). 
My recommendation is to never try and skirt this issue. 10 million in gains is guaranteed to not only draw the attention of the IRS, but most likely would land you in serious legal trouble if you simply ignored it and don't file taxes.
Seriously, it's not that bad. You establish a cost basis, export all your trade history from the exchanges, give that to your accountant, and pay the piper. Then you can sleep well at night and enjoy your profits.

Not sure why everyone in this community is so defensive. I think it's a silly idea, that's all.

A car is a depreciating asset. If you have a running vehicle that is reliable, don't waste your money! Invest in something that grows over time.

The average person misunderstands fiat devaluation. They simply see prices rise each year, and mistakenly blame the mean corporations for being greedy.
OP, it's difficult for btc followers to reason with the population who has this fatal misbelief.

How do you know I haven't?
Also, do you have to run your node 24/7 to keep your listing up?

It may be a pretty useless product, but hey, best of luck to them.

What a joke.
A blockchain requires a high level of data redundancy, this is very inefficient for a private corporation not requiring a trustless and decentralized environment.
@_date: 2015-10-05 21:13:58
I guess I just don't understand the idea of only using something because it has more marketing.
Even if you don't like NXT, listings are stored on the blockchain, completely. You don't have to run a node 24/7 to keep the item up. It's clearly superior, but of course, it doesn't have marketing...so it doesn't count...

Someone has to use it, doesn't reflect negatively on the tech if nobody even tries it out.
It has effectively 0 fees, you can pay in multiple currencies, listings are hosted natively on the blockchain. Not sure what else you want.

If passed, then crypto exchanges would be treated as "like-kind", meaning that an exchange from one cryptocurrency to another would not generate a taxable event. (You wouldn't have to keep track of all crypto trades to establish a cost basis, just when you got ownership of the original coins and when you sold back for fiat)

The good thing about math is that it's not subject to silly regulations. They can try all they want, AES and RSA are open source.
