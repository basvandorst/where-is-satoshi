I had every extra security on my blockchain wallet, 2FA, SMS verification and even banned tor IPs and still got hacked twice on two different wallets! Totaling over 12k USD in btc , I've since smartened up and realized blockchain is less safe than walking through Compton at night wearing a Rolex and now only use electrum and keep majority of holdings in cold storage. Blockchain is convenient for small amounts but that's it!

Mine took 4 days to eastern Canada from cz republic by ups, insanely fast! Especially if you consider I ordered it on a Saturday night! Like OP I freaking LOVE this thing as well, super ez n secure! I'm one of the unfortunate bastards who got his blockchain hacked somehow DESPITE have 2FA, SMS verification AND disabled tor IPS all set up so after losing just OVER 19 BTC doing everything  blockchain.info led me to believe I'd be secure, I made the 2 BIGGEST security errors ever ; 1-by putting my btc and faith in a completely incompetent (and after talking with them I realized completely UNCARING) company and, even worse, 2- letting someone else hold my privkeys! I LOVE my trezor cuz it doesn't involve me trusting ANYONE and I NEVER worry before logging in to see my account unlike I had been for a while now. So for what it's worth, web wallets shouldn't be used at all IMO but if they are, no more then needed for spending immediately or an amount your willing to lose eventually. THANKS TREZOR!

Thanks! Just use code and got myself another trezor en route, absolutely love my first one. After being hacked 3 times since I got into Btc (mid2011 to now) and lost over 27,000usd in Btc at rates when taken, trezor been a god send cuz I ain't lost a single satoshi since storing my Btc on device. thank again !  Judging by the promo code I'm guessing they started listening to the rumblings in the community

True but I think the comparisant to gox is the issue of not being able to get your Btc our for long time (leading to eventual collapse and addition that there is no Btc left) I don't think reference was comparing goxx to the (potential lol) ponzi in effect over there
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:15:34
My bet would be on the latter

I'd say depends how long you intend or are able to hodl before cashing out

Wow! Just read all that, so many people getting screwed yet again and they seem to really believe their money is not gone already and its really a technical problem being fixed, I guess when you got kihing left but irrational hope you gotta go with it! I do feel terrible for these people and I've been into Btc since early 2011 and since then I've lost more than my fair share of Btc so I sincerely do empathize with all these people but unfortunately here is little to no hope you are seeing any Btc back, sorry. IF any Btc is seen (which I highly highly doubt) it'll be a few people getting a few % of what they had to keep the scan going a Lil longer
