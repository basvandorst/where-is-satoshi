Check out Salt coin.  Essentially offer loans against your crypto

It offers loans against crypto, not just bitcoin. More users, more coins available to leverage against. So people who have significant money invested in hodls with expectations of large profit down the road don't have to sell potential gold mines in case they need to liquidate suddenly. I understand I commented on r/bitcoin but perhaps you should do some research about the potential growth of other alt coins before you decide to be a condescending cunt ;)

That also stems from people preaching hodl and wondering why it’s not being adopted as a currency
