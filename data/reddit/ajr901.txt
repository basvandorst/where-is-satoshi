Ahhh OK. Gotcha! Regardless even if I was a dolphins fan, I could still say Fuck the Jets! It's the one thing we Patriots and Dolphin fans seem to agree upon. Are you a Jets fan?

(DISCLAIMER: I am somewhat new to Bitcoin) Since MtGox is considered to be "inflated", does that mean that I wouldn't be able to sell for the current price of ~$990? I have some bitcoin on Coinbase where the price is roughly $890. If I send my Bitcoin from Coinbase to MtGox, I am assuming I would be able to cash in on the higher price, correct?

Alright, I'll pay attention more to fees. And I've already thought of the delay in purchasing/selling. The closest thing I have come up with as a "solution" would be buying the 15 coins on Coinbase, and sending them to MtGox and selling them there. You can keep a USD balance on MtGox. Buy/sell/buy/sell all on MtGox. If I ever want to cash out, just purchase the equivalent value in BTC on MtGox, and send them to Coinbase where I can then get USD deposited into my bank account. The only other issue with this is that Coinbase has a daily and monthly limit to transactions. I have yet to find another Exchange as convenient as Coinbase but that doesn't have the limits. Another option is Localbitcoins.com but I'm not so sure that fits the "convenient" label.

Well, I hate to do this to you, but I live in Miami. However, I did live in Boston and that's when I got into football and became a Pats fan. People move around, you know?

I wouldn't buy Bud even if it was 99% off under the condition that I paid with bitcoin. Piss water. *HOWEVER*, I do think it's really cool that Bitcoin is being associated with such a giant as Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch).

Yeah, I've been wanting to get in this "day trading" thing. I plan on purchasing 15 BTC. For the sake of the example lets say I wake up early in the morning and purchase 15 BTC at $1000 each. Throughout the day I keep my eye on it and it hits $1015 which I'm happy with, and I sell all 15 coins. I just made $225 (not including fees). I can then repeat a few times per day or once per day or whatever the market allows for on that particular day/week/etc. Do you see any issues that I may run into that I am overlooking? Some pointers would be greatly appreciated!

Not a crash, just a bitcoin sale. Grab yours while supplies last!

Still regretting not making that $500 purchase of bitcoins late in 2011 like I almost did. I would be cashing out today :/
