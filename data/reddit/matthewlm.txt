I am making quite a few assumptions in this survey but it should hopefully help understand what consumers expect from online wallets and fast payment services. The success of any new service commercially really depends upon the future direction of bitcoin overall but will bitcoin have much of a future unless it can be made consumer friendly and facilitate fast, secure transactions?

I'll be changing it to a more permissive license a bit later but it wont be completely permissive like he MIT license. It will allow for closed source distributions and compatibility with the Apache license 2.

I'm considering making a new bitcoin client and an web browser client incorporating missing features and taking into respect user feedback. Style of the user interface is definitely an important consideration.

Thanks to everyone who has responded seriously. I took off the silly responses I've seen.

Wouldn't this require new card readers, ATMs and online merchant software to work?

Hello Jesset77. Thanks for the donation.
cbitcoin will be able to validate the block-chain fully or by headers only. It will include node software. It will not have mining software but you will be able to do the other things you have mentioned. You can generate bitcoin addresses and sign transactions. The different parts of the bitcoin protocol are kept largely separated and give room for variance in how the library is used.

Before people slander me and my project, I would appreciate it if you would first email me at cbitcoin I would be delighted to make clear any misunderstandings. Otherwise, please keep your cynical thoughts to yourself.
First of all, I absolutely do not plan to monetise this project through a commercial license. I also plan to use all donations towards the development of this project. I'm not running off with people's donations.
The reason I want to retain copyrights, is so that I am able to manage the licensing of the software, as toomin says. The GPL license is temporary as I want to introduce a more permissive license once I have that sorted out. The MIT license is too permissive. I will likely use a custom license, somewhere in-between the MIT license and the GPL, but I'm yet to have that finalised. Until I'm ready I'll use the GPL license.
Regards to all,
Matthew Mitchell.

People can place their own code under their own copyright perhaps, but for contributions to the cbitcoin project that I am managing, it makes sense for me to deal with the copyrights.
People may use GPL with a commercial license, but I am not doing that. I am going to use another license. Which distros wont except non-OSI licenses, and why should I care? Has any bitcoin software actually before made it into Linux (I assume you mean) distributions?
The license I am to make will be very similar to GPL, and will be copy-left, but will remove some of the obligations associated with the GPL, and make it easier for people to use.

This is why I'm using exceptions for the GPLv3 license. These exceptions can be removed but are valid for those that receive them (In section 7: "When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it."). So essentially the code is still under the GPLv3. It's not ideal but on balance, it's the best way I think, and I've been advised to do this by the Software Freedom Law Center and others.
I want a proper copy-left license since I would absolutely hate for my work to be commercialised through license restrictions and royalties, which can be done without a copy-left license.
It's just a shame the GPL is not exactly what I want. The exceptions will go someway towards getting there. The LGPL is worse in my opinion, as it still allows for commercialisation of my work using copyright.

Whilst it's not ideal, I'm looking at using exceptions to the GPLv3 license. An exceptions allowing for distribution without source-code and another exception for OpenSSL linkage.
