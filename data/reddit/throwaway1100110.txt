Yeah that bugs me too.

I dont know who's downvoting you, so have an upvote.
I've still never heard anyone ever call it that though.  Besides a shell script apparently.
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:52:57
No, that's quite a stretch
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:23:10
Gyft, bit pay, coin base, and more and more places accept it.
Its getting easier everyday 
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:45:35
Well, I've been looking for a reason top stop smoking real cigs.
I'll check it out.
@_date: 2014-01-23 05:30:59
To be fair, I'd totally buy acid with bit coins if I though I could get away with it.
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:10:06
Perfect response.  My only problem with PC gaming is I really don't like windows.
But I'd be all over the steam machine, and I think PC gamers will like it as well.

I'll make an enhancement request on github if nobody else has already.
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:30:34
Literally never heard anyone call it that.  Not even the apple store employees
@_date: 2014-01-18 08:16:36
Yeah.  Gold isn't legal tender either...
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:26:47
Fuck the xbone, ps4 all the way! Hell yeah
Edit: fuck. They sold out.
Get back in stock damn you! Shut up and take my money!
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:10:25
OS ten? No one calls it that....  its OS X
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:40:53
Lol, "machine elves"
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:02:00
Wise decision
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:40:37
Aw, I see someone's jealous
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:38:21
Its not on my keyboard, and  not memorizing the specific commands to create one for that one word.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:48:23
Lol.  Like I have 20 bitcoins.
Only 10...  which is nothing to shake a stick at though
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:23:03
Well, I hope for all y'all sake bit coin only appreciates in value.
Sounds like you guys deserve it
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:43:16
Not according to my info.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:51:31
Also they did warn ahead of time not to leave unspent coin with the site.
Seems they should have tested the failsafe, but I can't see any malicious intent.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:03:17
Could send out a mass email with the sob story inviting people to send a few bucks his way.
Probably will never see the entire amount, but its way better than nothing 
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:35:02
You joke, but...
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:31:38
I wish dart would take off.
I'd much rather have a client side dart app, mainly for the speed and the added security static typing brings (yeah its optional, but best for security stuff)
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:16:56
If that's reputable, its a good option.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:43:51
Someone posted a recovery tool here not long ago.
I think that's one of your best bets.
Yeah write it off in your mind, but there's still a decent chance you can recover it.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:59:30
Yes, also to be able to even begin to do that, the CPU would need more processing time and up to date information about the software used than the software actually running has access to.
Maybe soon it'll be viable, but it isn't now
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:25:17
Damn, hope they didn't give it all away, for their sake!
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:49:33
Hell, a safe deposit box with a paper backup can be done at a local bank.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:01:43
This is literally the most pathetic troll attempt I've ever seen.
@_date: 2013-12-22 09:45:10
Pretty much anywhere.
Some places might set reasonable limits, but you can typically buy a very small piece anywhere.
The bitcointip bot will give you a few cents to play around with, if that's what you want. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:11:30
They deleted their comment, but as a programmer that's pretty accurate.  Js, flash, or a java applet are pretty much your only options when you need something done client side.
