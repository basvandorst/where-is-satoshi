I said that yesterday would be the last day of $8k BTC, I was wrong.  Today will be the last day of 8k BTC

End of May isn't even guaranteed, nothing is guaranteed but going by the last 4 years, market should be recovering by then.

The last two days I called for an end to sub 9k Bitcoin, I was wrong, what I have actually been meaning to say is that I'll just shut up now. It'll be there soon

Although it'd be nice to get another sale on all coins but after the last 2 6k scenarios I don't have enough expendable fiat for another fire sale. Lol. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:34:48
You'd be stupid to sell, it'll be over 10k by the end of May
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:36:57
It's only may, consensus is next week so expect price to run
