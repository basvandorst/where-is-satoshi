@_date: 2016-06-16 20:10:37
Yes, I understand the idea of a 51% attack. Actually just re-read [post and maybe I interpreted it incorrectly. If you are saying that Bitcoin cannot work if it is rational to be dishonest, then I agree. I just think that Bitcoin also cannot work if we need a miner to be honest even when honesty isn't in their best interest. So I don't see it as honesty *instead* of rationality. Said another way, honesty and self-interest (rationality) have to be in agreement for Bitcoin to work.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:08:30
Ok, I think we're all on the same page. Thanks for clarifying. :-)
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:50:21
Continue to HODL. But if you want to buy something with Bitcoin, just buy that amount of Bitcoin and immediately use it for the purchase. That's what I do. It's a little bit of a hassle but worth not upsetting the tax man IMO.
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:36:03
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't it be more accurate to say that Bitcoin cannot work if we need honest miners (or anyone for that manner). I would say rationality should trump honesty in a trustless system any day of the week. I don't mean to be confrontational, I just don't understand that last statement. Am I missing something?

I believe it activates when there is 95% consensus on average over the last 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks). So when the red line hits 95% it will activate.

Sorry I said anything. Just reviewed your comment history in this sub and you're clearly just here to stir up shit and not to actually contribute to intelligent conversation. Sorry for engaging.

@_date: 2017-04-26 13:21:53
Good point about the UASF. But I'm still not sure ASICBOOST was the big cause of their rejection if SegWit soft fork. Honestly though, what matters is that they are trying to increase their power through political means. I agree 100% with you that their job is just to confirm transactions build the blockchain, not determine how the Bitcoin and/or Litecoin evolve. They don't get to fire developers.
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:33:56
Oh I wasn't aware. Thanks for clarifying that. That definitely changes things then.
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:02:18
Yes, it doesn't sound like ASICBOOST to me. It sounds like they are opposing SegWit on Bitcoin (especially as a hard fork) simply because it means Core gets their way and fulfills more of their roadmap. It means more power to developers and less power to miners (in their opinion). It's a fight for power. They only agreed to SegWit on Litecoin because Charlie Lee agrees to future block increases.
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:42:47
I agree that BU is ridiculous. I'm with you there. I'm am 100% pro SegWit and think Core is great and they know what they're doing. But I'm just saying from a technical non-emotional standpoint that it does seem like a valid point that BTC.Top isn't using covert ASICBOOST if they aren't mining empty blocks. That's all I'm trying to say. Isn't that the way covert ASICBOOST works? Or am I missing something? I may just be completely wrong about that (if so, please correct me) but I thought that's how it works.
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:24:44
Maybe that's how we'll get segwit after all! Just rename testnet! Hahaha!
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:47:11
Dude, don't forget to breathe. You can't post completely unprompted stuff like that and not expect a reaction. Not sure what you thought you'd accomplish with that one.
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:46:09
I think it's better said that Bitcoin is like dollars, not like a bank transfer. A bitcoin blockchain transaction is like a bank transfer. A Bitcoin lightning network transaction is like Visa it's still using Bitcoin just like your Visa card is still using dollars same as your bank account. The thing that some people are missing here is that a lightning network transaction IS a Bitcoin transaction. It's just a cheaper, faster Bitcoin transaction that only requires a very rare settlement (like the bank transfer).
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:32:13
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:16:32
"There have been some other UASF proposals that avoid the forced disruption-- by just defining a new witness bit and allowing non-upgraded-to-uasf miners and nodes to continue as non-upgraded, I think they are vastly superior. They would be slower to deploy, but I do not think that is a flaw."
Can anyone elaborate on this? What proposals is he referring to? Is anyone writing anything up?

You seemed to have missed the "and not expect a reaction" part of my comment. Or if you didn't miss it than am I to assume that you did it to purposefully try to get these types of reactions?  Hold on a minute while I Google the definition of trolling...

Lightning Network will effectively do that but it's different because the transaction is confirmed by a LN node rather than on the blockchain. It has a failsafe of a slower blockchain transaction so security trade-off is minimal while still having scalable instant transactions with decentralization.

Yes you must "lock-in funds" just like locking funds into a checking account. The first thing you do is an on chain transaction that will have a fee as you said. That is equivalent to opening a checking account. Then you can make and receive payments using that account (or channel). I don't see a problem with it.
