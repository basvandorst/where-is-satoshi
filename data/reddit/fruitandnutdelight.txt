Yep. That's enough to make one more useful than the other. A $100 dollar bill is significantly inferior to 100 x $1 coins (or bills in US) when it comes to utility for an individual. A company would obviously prefer bundles of $100, so there's definitely utility, it just depends on what scale and for which market.

If dogecoin get their direct fiat &lt;-&gt; doge working, there will be no need for those interested in dogecoin to buy bitcoin. Without a community using  the coin, it's not worth anything. If doge becomes independent, Bitcoiners would do well to start taking notice.

true... until dogecoiners no longer need bitcoin to get dogecoin

I could not imagine. I'm sorry.
+100 doge

This could have happened to anyone. +100 doge
It's not much, I know, but we feel for you.

hey man, 1btc is still a loss I'd prefer to avoid. It's not much, but maybe this'll help a little.
+100 doge

what innovation has bitcoin achieved that dogecoin can't take advantage of? what has it done recently? dogecoin is taking days to achieve what took bitcoin years. Bitcoin is fantastic and paved the way, but it's doge that's innovating

+75 doge

then it has begun

the 'why?' is because *people* can use dogecoin. 100 dogecoin is a few cents, but it's fun to splash around. 1btc is nudging 1000AUD, so it's inaccessible for everyday use. It's great for businesses and companies, or as an investment, but people can *use* dogecoin, and that's kind of a revelation for crypto-currency

Of course. No disrespect intended.
