Raid his house?
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:47:51
If he were, I doubt the AFP would have raided his house like they did.
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:02:49
That's one I was yet to see, cheers.
@_date: 2014-06-29 09:25:24
Yes. Yes it is.
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:07:41
It's really not polite to ask how much money a person has.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:55:57
He may have already collected the BTC though… isn't that why he should go to gaol?
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:56:44
… uh yeah. Fuck yeah.
@_date: 2014-09-06 04:15:12
Wasn't it his chiropractors bill?
Edit: [Yeah](
Edit 2: IIRC the guy fucked over almost everyone who ordered his book and became most hated. Sad really. His humour is amusing.

You do realise that English as a language isn't exclusive to the US, right?
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:13:35
Meh, seen that one.

@_date: 2013-06-27 09:28:39
Wow. That was quite interesting. I kept asking myself "why am I interested?" though.
BTW which bank paid for that Buttcoin website?

[Read this](
If you meet the indicators (which I doubt many miners would) then you are in business and should declare and pay tax on any bitcoins you earn through your mining business.
If you don't meet the indicators you are a hobbyist and hobby income is a windfall gain generally and isn't taxed in Australia.
If then you are still not sure, [apply for a ruling]( they are binding advice from the ATO.
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:17:33
So… you don't like the risk you took? Better stop taking risks then, eh?
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:03:25
You're username makes me want to make that pun from *Stranger than Fiction* about the box of flours.
@_date: 2013-06-24 10:37:45
If you drive on a road or send your kids to a school in Australia, or you were publicly educated or went to a private school for that matter tax paid for that.
If you have a medicare card, the taxation system also pays for that, and I could go on.
Do your share. Don't steal from those who do.
Declare the money you earn.
Pay your tax.

The Silk Road has already fucked bitcoins reputation, but I have noticed some pretty crazy posts around here recently too.
@_date: 2013-06-24 10:56:16
So don't pay.... see where it gets you. I hope you can hang onto the soap.
@_date: 2013-07-23 22:04:48
&amp;gt; Well that's where you and me disagree. Capitol punishment is never acceptable.
Why would you want to punish a building? 
Capit**a**l punishment isn't appropriate for property crimes ***ever***.
No matter what a persons stance on state authorised killing, no sane person should advocate death for stealing, that's North Korea shit right there.
@_date: 2013-06-24 14:58:59
Tax is not theft. Learn the law.
@_date: 2013-06-24 11:45:45
Look everyone, this hipster found a new word.
statist. Ha!
I live in the real world.
@_date: 2013-06-24 11:02:06
That's just naïve.
@_date: 2013-05-19 09:02:32
I stand corrected... I was just guessing by the accent(s) a shitload closer than the Cowboy you must admit.
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:09:39
I second that. 
Maybe instead of the bald eagle with the thirteen arrows (can barely even see the olive branch) you should choose something that doesn't represent most of what people dislike about US foreign policy.
@_date: 2013-06-27 11:19:21
*I agree* with most of that. 
The general public, the police and the tax authorities however do not. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 08:38:15
They're Czech Cowboy, not Russian.
@_date: 2013-06-24 11:00:15
Exactly this. 
Don't get caught up in this seppo "don't pay tax they use it to burn kids with Napalm" bullshit. Most of your tax dollars are spent right here in Australia on your society. 
To those of you who think ripping off your fellow citizens by evading tax is cool or hip, grow the fuck up and pay your share.
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:01:41
Good. Glad to hear it. Enjoy your world class education. I hope it is a worthwhile field.
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:00:46
No. Quite reasonable to see both sides. Paying tax is your duty as a citizen. The try hard anarchist on this sub are clowns, don't fall for their bullshit.
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:43:39
Except Chase, because they are a pack of cunts.

Anything around $10,000 or above will attract attention.
