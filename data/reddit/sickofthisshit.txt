What do you think happens to all the network engineers and power infrastructure keeping the Internet alive when a nuclear war starts causing EMP all over the place?

Um, I call it "writing a check with a few zeros."
And I've never had a problem. What are *you* talking about?

The cash you hand the bank is an asset to the bank. But that is precisely cancelled by the liability of the deposit. Because they will have to give that cash back if you ask for it at the ATM.

You seem not to understand that a deposit account is a *liability* for a bank: they owe you money to be paid at some unknown later date. That is a debt. The way a bank gets assets is by lending money to people who have to pay the bank back.
Now from the point of view of the depositor, it is true that the value of the deposit account is slightly impaired from its nominal balance because of the risk that something screwy might happen with the banking system, ranging from a 1933-style bank holiday, or the bank closing all of its branches, or the bank website going down when you want to pay your bills online, or the Fed turns the screws so that banks start *charging* interest on deposits, or imposing fees or haircuts on withdrawals. But you also get the convenience of electronic transactions and ATM networks, etc., so it might still be worth keeping money in the bank even if it gets a negative return.
