I thought Coinbase has ties with BCH centralization so any help/support for Bitcoin goes against their interests... is this true?

It's the brand that is very appealing to ride along. When mainstream people more and more hear about Bitcoin and take interest on that, they logically go first to Bitcoin -twitter account and Bitcoin.com and the BCASH propaganda starts there.  Maybe it's same here in reddit.. with BTC confusion and more derailing.

There is nothing to correct. It's all good.

Wy do you even try to "trade"?  You will do the best profits with HODL strategy.

Xmas sale. People selling for Xmas present shopping?

This seems to be so overpriced.. If this is supposed to follow Bitcoin FIAT value changes.. why is it trading today like Bitcoin would be at 30k USD price?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:37:22
There is a "sell wall" at 19k for about 600 bitcoins so many people have put their coins on sale for that price. It takes a bigger volume in purchases to buy that off. So it goes zig zag colliding to that wall before those coins are bought off.

Bless you sir.

Well it depends on your plan and what do you know about cryptocurrencies?  
Maybe you decided to invest in Bitcoin that you heard people talking about and then got somehow misled when you saw two options Bitcoin and BCash? 
There are many different cyptocoins including many copycats.

Does this (Dec 28) Segwit fork create a new coin or does it still have the same (BTC) identifier considering also markets outside the blockchain ETF:s, Futures etc. ?

Closing in 19,5k WALL , whacha gonna do about it?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:18:42
Sounds like a legit plan... or does it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:09:27
You don't move your bitcoins to cold storage, only the keys to your bitcoins. Your bitcoins are still and always in the blockhain so forks and everything apply.

@_date: 2017-12-16 19:43:03

@_date: 2017-12-16 22:22:21
