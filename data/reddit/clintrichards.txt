in that sense it is ok, and on par with the competitors.  If there is less BTC in circulation, value goes up for all holders.
It would be a shame to not pass it on to loved ones though.
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:16:34
you are rather risky with your bitcoin trx compared to me!
When I need to send btc i always send 0.0001 first, confirm i got it. confirm it works, confirm the confirms.... AND THEN i send the rest.. or even do another slightly larger test depending on paranoia level that day.
hope 0.1 btc  lost doesn't crush your spirit, that'd hurt me a lot, like 2 months of DCA at current rates!

I use mycelium a lot, it way over estimates fees, but you can still select a cheap fee, swipe right on the "class" down to 'economy' and the swipe right on all the rates until the lowest.  3sat/byte is very cheap.
Definitely use a bech32 address and send to a bech32 address if you can, will reduce the size of the payload making the trx far cheaper.

Fiat is being printed every day.  A crazy amount of it. From [  In 1990, total currency in circulation in the world passed one trillion United States dollars. After 12 years, in 2002 this figure was two trillion USD, and in 2008 it had increased to four trillion USD.
If Fiat is being printed faster than BTC, then BTC will go up in value, relative to USD.  This is where we come up with this.  Add on the fact that this is a new currency, that is more limited than gold, easier to transfer than fiat and infinitely divisible, and impossible to destroy and the potential for adoption is the entire planet, including machines, AI and non human entities of all sorts.  Of course we are optimistic about Bitcoin.  It is the future, and the future IS BRIGHT.

1 to 3 sat per byte is all we should be using.

Bitcoin has a proven track record for reliability and stability.  Lightning does everything the alt coins claim to do and much more.  I'm not saying no alt coins will do well, but there is no alt coin at this point which holds a candle to Bitcoin.
It is also very hard to recreate the origins of bitcoin, being born into absolute obscurity, grass roots movement through the cyberworld with a slow steady adoption.  Now if you put out a crypto it's either a POP with a huge launch with paid sponsorship to get it on many exchanges and to hepe it up fast, or a total fizzle... maybe one of these fizzles will turn out to be a long term grass roots growth.... but so far I haven't seen any evidence of that.

This is my favorite way to show the effect.  They keep doubling fiat in circulation faster and faster, the lower they push the interest rate the more money that gets created and spent, generally frivolously.

@_date: 2019-07-25 22:05:11
This might be a viable solution.  Split the key up into multiple parts, one part could be on some sort of service that will "alert you" and wait about 6 months before divulging it's secrets ( giving you time to reject the request )  while distributing the trust among those you trust.  If they violate your trust you will know in this way and they never get the key.  
Problem now is if one or more of these individuals dies, or loses their piece of the key then it is lost for everyone !

The S&amp;P500 will stop trading if it starts to crash though.  They \`protect\` your investment through heavy manipulation and regulation.

a miner can exclude a transaction but the nodes will keep it in the mempool until it is in a block.  If the nodes reject the trx because it doesn't fit their criteria then it's an invalid trx.

did anyone buy with btc?
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:37:32
anything is possible. A state actor creating a competing coin and air dropping it to their citizens could really make waves. Does it matter though? We don't need it to be the biggest to remain the most trusted.

I prefer to validate too!  I should have included sources in my first reply.  thanks for keeping me on my toez

trading is losing. There is no way around it.
Just think about the taxes you owe now too.
How much the exchange made off you.
how much those people you bought your shitcoin made from you.
makes you never want to play these games again... doesn't it?

Say in 10 years blocks will be at least 100x bigger. 100 megabytes.
So at 1sat/byte
100 million satoshis  is a full bitcoin.
not sure what that will be in terms of USD, but it's sure to be a whole lot. Maybe so much that we'll need to drop prices lower than 1 sat/byte minimum.

use a trezor. .
everyone, use a hardware wallet, especially if you use windows.
anti virus has zero trust. no anti virus can help. don't use windows, that will help.
use a hardware wallet.
it's about 0.01 btc
did you get the part about a hardware wallet?
ps, i am sorry for your loss.  I would be absolutely beside myself.  Remember that even when using a trezor, always do a penny test first ( send a very very small amount, make sure it receives ok ) and of course, always double check the address before sending. always. first 3 letters, last three letters, middle three letters.
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:39:02
how does trezor not fit these three criteria?

don't really know who Joe Rogan is... the message is great though. 
The bitcoin path is dangerous, but it is the one that will get us where we want to be.

This has summaries and references !
and a bit more, Mt gox stuff: [
Here is where he shits on bitcoin on national tv [  this one is particularilly nasty.  He was trying to fill the mempool while causing panic to cause more people to move btc etc. ( When i saw this i was so hurt and upset... i could not believe he did this. was so excited to see bitcoin on tv too... )
not sure how to prove the /rbtc bitcoin. and  stuff... but you can take a look!
bans... [
no proof on needing popcorn, you'll have to take my word for that one :)

which ones are the Chinese ones?
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:04:16
FYI [Bitstamp.net]( is the most reputable around.
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:32:27
it doesn't matter if you're in the next block or not. don't pay moer than 1 sat / byte
@_date: 2019-08-09 20:32:36
Roger Ver, mega traitor.
Called cops on his dad over dispute with his car.
Denounced his american citizenship due to being incarcerated for selling explosives illegally
Stabbed Bitcoiners in the back by saying Mt Gox was SAFE when it was not.
Stabbed Bitcoiners in the back again by Forking BTC and promoting his shit coin as "THE REAL" bitcoin, utilizing r/btc [bitcoin.com]( and  
Went on NATIONAL TV in Dec 2017 and TOLD THE WORLD cryptos can 'just stop working, just like that' somehow thinking that this would make people buy his crypto over bitcoin.
And now in his r/btc subreddit that claims "no censorship" went on a ban spree.
What will he do next? No idea! But i need to grab me some POPCORN.
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:13:42
[Bitstamp.net]( is the best of the best!
[coinsquare.com]( is pretty darn good.
@_date: 2019-08-10 16:16:37
Do you guys think this is just an act? LIke Rager Whore realizes the game is up but has to act like he still supports that broken pos?
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:09:29
Everyone laughed at me.
Everyone talked down to me, how could bitcoin ever be anything.
Everyone told me to sell at 600, and 200, and 1000, and 4000 and told me it is stupid to hodl.
Who's laughing now.
@_date: 2019-08-01 00:55:25
nobody can stop Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:50:18
step one of trezor set up is to back up your key.
mobile phones have lots of options for wallets, and should be treated just like your regular wallet for cash, just keep an amount on there for immediate spending and refil from trezor as needed.  A few lightning enabled wallets now too!
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:17:28
That is kind of trippy. I am both surprised and happy they kept that scene.
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:05:26
How do people keep getting tricked by this electrum client? isn't there some way to stop it? Maybe report it to google or something? this is very sad.
I strongly recommend a trezor.
I am also very fond of the Bitcoin CORE client, to use this you must make sure your PC is secure, considering your current situation, you should probably avoid it.  You could get a separate computer loaded with linux/bsd and use it only for bitcoins with the core client.

Double down, buy another $1,000 ! And another, and another.  Do this for four years. DCA is the way to go, especially in a volotile market with long terms prospects being almost guaranteed UPPP.  Almost.
