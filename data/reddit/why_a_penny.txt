It should calculate the debt in btc. That number would go down while the other went up

It's like having a hole in your roof and you live on the bottom floor. A bucket stops the hurt. Bucket catches all the water so you never fix the roof. Then the bucket gets full, so you get a bigger bucket. Problem solved. Eventually your just living in a bucket.
A temp fix means the network won't be bothered to signal a necessary change because it is no longer "necessary".

Gold is a hedge for emergency. Do u think bit coin would be valuable if a natural disaster took out communications? Can't transfer btc in that scenario,  but you could still transact physically with precious metals and gems

thanks for your interest.  I am wrapping this up and will reply back to you with a url.  Hopefully either later today or tomorrow.

I did a bit of research before getting to this point.  Truth was, even as an advanced user, i thought it would be awfully simple to get an offline, airgapped wallet.  Something i could trust and know it was secure for long term storage.
This was not easy at all, in all honesty.  Maybe i couldnt find the correct resources, but every thing i read just discussed how to do it, which required a linux live os and another jump drive with wallet programs to install from, etc etc.  So i just downloaded ubuntu, chrooted into the iso and installed the wallets and repackaged it. 
Then i could simply boot from it and create the wallet, write it down on paper and upon shutdown it was all wiped clean.  the box never had to connect to the internet. 
Anyway, i have the iso and just was curious if anyone else thought it would be handy.

That's a good point, maybe I wasted time making it so simple. So maybe I gear it, instead, toward more advanced users. There could be other ways of doing it, but this one is a pretty easy way, no matter how advanced ones btc or computer skills.

Sorry there are not many serious replies here.  The basic answer is "yes, of course".  You can buy and sell btc just as you can with any currency, commodity or stock.  
In many peoples opinion, a smart investment would be to buy and hold.  If you are looking for short term investing, well hope you play your cards right.
As with any financial advice, one must warn not to "invest" more than you can afford losing.  ESpecially in the case of bitcoin, because it is volatile.
In my opinion, buying a bitcoin and holding for an indeterminate amount of time is a great gamble.  The potential return on risk is high.
If I buy 1 btc at $815.00 (or so, US) then I can lose a max of 815.00.  However, the ceiling on bitcoin is very very high.  By very high i mean hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars each.

Tails is not necessarily air-gapped and also may require a user to have some knowledge of linux.  It is more geared toward advanced users.
I am trying to create an option targeted at beginners, something i can give to my uncle in which he could create a cold-storage crypto wallet.  Someone who has never created a wallet, nor ever touched linux.

I have had a hard time finding these, any links?  Are they geared to air-gapped cold storage?
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:22:03
Thank you. If you are interested in checking it out, I can give you a link tomorrow.

this is a very likely possibility.

Good idea. I will look into that. With electrum it's similar, you create seed words that together with electrum creates a private key.  As long as you have the seed words you can use electrum to recreate them. Wrote the 12 seed words down, or choose 12 seed words you can remember along with their exact order, and that's it.

no idea.  it is very odd.  they even have a tweet from like 24 hours before talking about how good the profit on x11 was.  strange.

And would cost almost 3.50 to send ಠ_ಠ. Still, much better than it was 2 months ago

I'll check them out. Currently I went with Prohashing.com
