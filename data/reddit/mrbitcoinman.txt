miners fees
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:24:30
I'm not surprised. I've talked a lot of shit about airbitz and their garbage wallet on this subreddit and realized that the airbitz people have a very aggressive marketing campaign. They monitor Reddit and do their best to counter-argue you. These guys are pretty much the pop-up ad of bitcoin wallets. Stay away. None of their 'services' are necessary and the wallet is bloated and ugly. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 23:42:22
yes that's high and it's a convenience fee. The best Canadian exchange in my experience is Quadriga .. Interac online i think is 1.5% fee or $5.... 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:09:19
hey this is friggin cool! I might get one ....
@_date: 2016-08-31 20:46:18
i used an instacoin once or twice ... the fees killed me... :( 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:57:16
:) convicts have jobs. They get paid. False positives happen for sure but a risk model system is happy to eat those losses to prevent fraud. This all happens behind doors. Most people don’t even know they’re flagged as high risk 
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:57:46
Vanilla cards only probably 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:13:07
Only because you're an idiot. If you have a transaction sent from coinbase to shapeshift, you're going to get a runaround. Shapeshift will blame coinbase and coinbase will blame shapeshift, should anything go wrong during the transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:57:22
You need to have a node running online to ensure the party you open a channel with isn't trying to screw up the payment state. This is true. It's also true that you can use a third-party to do this if you're using a mobile device or otherwise don't have the internet on at all times.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:11:06
People shouldn't be sending transactions from one exchange to another. It makes it hard to find who the problem is when something DOES happen
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:02:16
Resurrected after shapeshift bought them. Sure. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:42:36
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:33:32
they just get a slice of the fees for running smart contracts. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:40:29
Coinbase processes transactions using a particular code. There is a legit 'bitocin' code for visa processing, so I assume they use that. Credit card companies determine how to handle that payment code.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:15:40
One is a second-layer solution and the other is a side-chain. They are not in competition.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:00:44
Fun fact. When Draper won his auctioned coins, he had his bitcoin address relayed over phone. When they sent the coins, they did so with a fee that was too low and so it took some time for the transaction to get confirmed, to the dismay of everyone involved.

@_date: 2018-01-08 15:23:30
yeah most of the power thats going into bitcoin mining would otherwise be wasted. It's not like we have a good storage solution for power right now. Bitcoin is the best way to store excess power at this point, really.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:11:21
That's a pretty silly argument. That possibility exists in todays fraud tools and yet they still work and people buy licenses. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:25:54
Wirex looks to be in the best position to start offering new card services. I'd keep an eye on them, as their crypto-bank solution is going to kill it!
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:38:45
miners aren't stupid. They understand that lower fees mean more adoption which increases fees long-temr
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:27:02
working in the fraud industry, I can tell you that this is a load of bollocks. :] 
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:20:01
yeah this site is pretty bare boned... not sure why it's even necessary... Just stick with the daily segwit thread we have... they list all the wallets, like bitwallet ;)
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:05:21
Really. That’s your reply. Sure. Use it how you want but when things get fucked up you have only your self to blame. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:08:39
It says it's publicly available in a lite form but when you try to access it, it asks for information and promises only a demo. :( This is sad.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:16:07
put lightning out of your head. That shit won't even start becoming useful for a whole year and then it's rollout will be slow, lagging behind segwit adoption. I am a believer in lightning, but this is not a short-term resolution.

Anyone can get this data from bitcoins public blockchain
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:09:42
They need your xpub and 1 private key in order to compromise the whole wallet
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:24:02
yeah the miners are partly to blame. A lot of them left to mine bCash after the difficulty adjustment period, making blocks slow down to 20-30 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:25:52
mostly any other wallet. Bread, Copay, Mycelium, Bitwallet, Electrum, Exodus, etc

Please add BitWallet for IOS as segwit enabled
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:23:55
You get LN fees for forwarding a payment through your hub. There's no reason to think people won't want to do this. Most bitcoin owners are holders, anyway. This is a great way to stake your held coins to make a small profit while at the same time providing a service. People are right to say that in the very beginning, much like the internet, the hubs will be very centralized. But just like the internet, the older the network matures, the more decentralized it becomes. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:21:02
Wait ... people still use Kraken? 
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:28:49
Uhh ... sorry this question doesn’t make much sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:06:58
Subtracting the miner fee automatically would be nice. So annoying to figure it out on you own. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:39:54
The blockchain is publicly available. They have analytics tools to check the last few hops and, when a known gambling associated address is used, it sets off a flag that results in the removal of services to the violating account. If you want to gamble, withdraw your funds to an address you own before sending it to a gambling address or you risk violating terms of service and getting banned.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:52:24
Not really the best. Lots of opportunities to make a mistake or have exposure. Sure, it's better than a mobile device but it's still not ideal.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:15:55

@_date: 2017-12-07 14:20:01
This is fucking glorious. I can't think of anyone in the Bitcoin community who deserves this more than Andreas. Working in the field, I have to say that his work has made my job a butt ton easier. Hats off to you, Andreas. You're the man.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:29:23
This is all fluff. Of course they knew about insider trading. Why else would they keep it a secret like this? The investigation they're talking about is just them trying to save face. Coinbase did a piece of shit move.

@_date: 2017-12-14 16:49:07
Would have been cheaper to put a proper fee to begin with, I bet.
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:51:13
Coinjoin isn’t perfect for one. For two, were a long way from making it part of every transaction. Economically not viable until Schnorr ... for three. The bigger problem is a lack of privacy from spv users. You can coinjoin and be careful but have others from the coinjoin fuck up, making you more traceable. Privacy will take a long time to get right. Until then expect everything to be recorded and become decipherable. If not now, maybe in the future 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:36:46
hey this is the closest we've ever gotten to a completely disrupted, unusable blockchain network. I'm a small blocker myself, but holy fuck this better be looked at long and hard by core

Music is art, which is subjective. In terms of music complexity, there was a time everyone was studying music theory and enjoying the complex joys of classical music. We've since regressed to thinking songs like bohemian rhapsody are artistic marvels of our time when, in truth, its really simple like most rock songs.

People need to stop using this shitty wallet. It's simply the worst.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:59:54
Yes. Having a middle address prevents coinbase from being directly associated to gambling.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:27:00
technically, some nodes mine ... the pool uses a node to propagate the block and work out the nonce stuff.
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:12:07
You're absolutely wrong. This isn't smoke and mirrors. the change heuristic is pretty accurate and can be tweaked to fit the situation you're looking at. Coinjoins and a TumbleBIT break the heuristics, but mostly these things are super accurate. On top of that, they aren't just using blockchain analytics to cluster and label addresses. They use information such as Bloom Filter attacks, IP tracking, cookies, etc. to get details. Bitcoin privacy is scary broken right now. These heuristics are building associations and linking people to transactions they did five years ago.

@_date: 2018-09-12 12:58:48
The fuck? Why would anyone want to use that dumb mixer? You're just waiting for them to exit scam you. Instead, use Wasabi Wallet to shuffle your coins. If you're more technically inclined, you can use joinmarket for now.

Entering your recovery phrase into a computer exposes your key and defeats the purpose of having a hardware device to begin with.

BitWallet is my personal favorite. :) It's kind of advanced, but yeah .... it's probably the most powerful and feature rich wallet of any mobile device. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 13:40:48

Labels. Walletexplorer has a bunch 
@_date: 2018-09-28 13:51:20
It's not hard to get information on the address owner if you have the right tools. For example, it looks like that address uses a lot of BC1 transactions. This suggests they use Electrum, which is vulnerable to Bloom Filter attacks. Someone has probably clustered this address with other addresses owned by the party and associated them to an IP address merely by spying on the electrum server. If any of those inputs enter a registered exchange, you could send an inquiry to the exchange demanding the address owners KYC information. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 00:39:35
This is so weird. Prism is awesome. I have an account and used it several times. I am sad to see it going. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:16:37
It's pretty useless to me. I'm not going to risk 0.1 BTC every time I want to mix some coins. Why was the value set so high!? I can CoinShuffle 0.1 BCH, 0.01 BCH or 0.001 BCH all using Electron Cash and a simple plugin. You can also mix coins with yourself using cash shuffle. Why wouldn't anyone want to implement the CoinShuffle system and make liquidator bots handle the mixing. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 00:57:49
I doubt it. Look to a coins miners to judge its health. Hash power is super high. Bitcoin won’t go below the break even point for miners
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:18:21

I think denying ETFs and denying the Winklevoss Twins ETF should be different. The Winklevoss guys have a pretty fucked up system. I can see why the SEC didn't like it. The ETF would be manipulated super easily on Gemini.

@_date: 2018-05-15 16:50:51
considering they can't access most wallets in China, this is huge news.

ETH rigs? or GPUs? ;)
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:45:07
Whether or not you host your own server, Electrum's bloom filter is still making inquiries to the network regarding ALL your wallets generated public keys, right? That's no good.

@_date: 2018-05-10 11:25:40
Doubt they will be selling any new coins. They have enoug money to satisfy their debts. The rest of the bitcoin should probably remain as bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:14:59
Not necessarily forever. Maybe quantum computing will help recover these kinds of lost funds.

CoinJoin is susceptible to Sodoku and Boltzmann attack vectors. It's probably the best method we have right now, but we have to assume that the bigger analytics companies can defeat it. We've got to sit tight until TumbleBit gets working.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:02:27
Use your trezor with Electrum to use Opt-in RBF.
@_date: 2018-08-10 20:19:03
They don’t state their protocol to anonymize coins. Is this coinjoin? Tumble Bit? Some technical information would have been nice

Excluding paper wallets, It really works out like this:

Actually, you can use a ledger unplugged if you don't want the woes of carrying a cable. I use the java card and have had no problems with it. 
Breadwallet was/is also a bit buggy because it's so much newer.

it looks like they apply a 10% fee if you do this, making it pretty expensive

if it's your own bitcoin address, take a look at it on blockseer and see if you can recognize any of the transaction patterns :] Also, what's the address? I'll take a look.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:14:04
people running BU nodes actively care about the network and it's future. They are the zealots of bitcoin, going against the norm that is It's a very bitcoin notion so i dont know why people are surprised there's a lot of us who are against any sort of authority figure. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:05:46
you should keep a separate wallet used only for gambling. I suggest samourai

@_date: 2016-06-23 19:42:59
The digital currency exists on the device itself, unlike bitcoin where the coin is on the blockchain and you have a key to maintain it. So yes, no need for the internet or a blockchain. But yes make no mistake this is government-controlled. The Royal Mint of Canada governs it.

the unplugged has been working well for me! :) great place to hodl
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:41:12
they did that to me for my first purchase. It took about 3-5 days for them to OK my account and let me proceed! I was pissed because it was my first transaction, they SOLD me the bitcoin, then didn't let me move it. Had I known they would freeze my funds, I would have purchased a smaller amount so as not to tie all my money into that one purchase. It was the ol' bait and switch. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:53:24

Wasabi wallet can help you 
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:14:44
only need to verify yourself and send in KYC docs if you want to up your limits. Otherwise you can use the card fine with their considerable limits, never registering.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:05:01
he never withdrew any of the coins he mined, doesn't mean he didn't amass enough to live comfortably for the rest of his life. a man like Satoshi would know how to be anonymous on his own blockchain. This is all, of course, if you think satoshi as one person and not a team.

Bitcoin stores it's inputs in batches. If I give you $5 in paper money then $10 and then $20, they don't 'combine' together. Instead, they exist as separate inputs. When you want to send someone $35 worth, it'll send the 'batched' amounts together. Heuristics allow us to understand that all three addresses that are involved in that 'batching process' are the same actor. So, if someone sends you a tiny input and it gets batched in with an address, you can assume that both addresses are owned by the same party.
@_date: 2018-10-10 00:55:26
Probably the same. You can back up locally or to the cloud. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:49:45
MintChip is not like Bitcoin. It's NOT a Digital Currency. MintChip was not a digital currency akin to bitcoin, but rather a digital payment mechanism meant to function as an electronic cash that could be transferred between users.

i think that the halving will affect the price but it'll happen a few months down the road and not immediately after the halving. I believe this because the supply cut in coin will take time for the market to feel.

use wasabi wallet to mix coins not a tumbler
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:31:47
the amount you send doesn't factor into the price, just the number of inputs vs outputs

BitWallet for wallets.   
Crypto Pro for everything else.
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:22:47
You don't have to verify anything unless you want to increase your limits. I just got my Xapo card and have not sent them ANY documentation. In this case, it sounds like you went over your limits and because of that, they are imposing the KYC and AML regulations on you! I hope it all works out for ya :) I'm mostly happy with my xapo card. Just wish it came in CAD
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:16:11
judging by your earlier actions and the situation at hand, you're definitely blacklisted. Companies share information on who might be considered a high-risk and, during one of your tantrums, you must have made the list. That, or you have a history of chargebacks that make it not worth the risk to do business with you. Play nicely and this won't happen in the future! In the meantime, you should just stick to localtraders or BTM machines ;)

Just saying this has happened before. Kraken's USDT had a premium because of BitFinex's banking problems. I am not going to write off bitfinex anymore. I did it too many times and yet here they are. These guys are survivors and have clawed back from worse. :P Not that i hold any USDT or anything.

I expect Trezor will be one of the first to implement it. The code is ready. They were one of the first to enable it on LTC, too. Also, I think Exodus will do SegWit transactions very soon too.

bitfinex has had this issue before and pulled through just fine. Stop spreading FUD
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:30:44
more than likely China has a lot to do with the current price rise. We know this because the volume is mostly out of China and when they stop moving btc, the price drops. the halving isnt a reason for it and honestly, i dont think the halving will affect price until months and months ago .... 
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:51:28

shut up with this spam talk. This is definitely NOT a spam attack. The mempool jumps whenever there is a change in the price. That's it. No big deal. Quit with the FUD. it's ruining your credibility and makes it hard to get people to take this shit seriously when it does actually happen.
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:22:36

I would say about 80% of the blockchain is easily mapped out. All major entry and exit points are being monitored. Ever use an spv wallet? Buy from an exchange with kyc? Then it’s reasonable to assume that a skilled analyst can find out anything they want to know about you and your bitcoin

@_date: 2018-10-02 18:45:53
it's a really dumb choice. It reminds me of when Bread Wallet tried to force the bits standard down our throat. The company I work for can't recommend Samourai Wallet now because it's just not usable for actual consumer services. Now it's mostly just useful for speculation and hodling. :( 
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:56:52
the fees are more like 10% ... which is pretty high.. and i'm pretty sure that machine has a camera somewhere, don't you think? I know the owner who runs these ATM's in montreal is shifting focus to Monero.... thinks that's the next big thing...

Blue Wallet or Hodl
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:22:54
People are speaking about this as a negative but is it, really? A lot of people are going to spread out and find separate bitcoin services. For small startups like Paxful, or local exchanges like Quadriga, this is great news! Plus, we've known for months that Circle doesn't see a future in Bitcoin. Let's get these people utilizing services of companies who are behind the bitcoin movement!
@_date: 2019-08-27 11:56:29
I like them. Why would you say they suck? HODL is even a true spv wallet
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:43:39
I've dealt with Kraken customer service. It's do-able but it's nothing like the amazing Quadriga! best exchange ever.
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:08:03

i think Bitpay was merely trying to self preserve. They're operating on such tiny margins ... they've been hurt the most by scaling issues...

Mixers don't work any more and are extremely risky. If you want to increase privacy, look into a decentralized method where you never release ownership of your coins. (IE. Coinjoin)
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:27:45
Bread/Copay/Samourai are good as bitcoin wallets. Jaxx if you want a multi-coin wallet
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:42:00
Exodus is okay. Keeping your coins on a computer is one of the worst places to store it though. It's vulnerable to malware and viruses, no matter the software used. Weirdly enough, your phone is a better place for it security-wise. Hardware wallets are king of course.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:00:22
You'll want to go electrum to mixer to bitcoin full node if you value privacy. Only way to achieve full privacy is by having a full node my friend

please add pie charts. everyone likes pie.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:23:21
Not much can be done. A tiny bit of research on this subreddit would show you that blockchain is the worst wallet option for storing your wealth. Sorry you learnt the hard way. Use a proper wallet in the future, please.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:24:55
opened a channel, sent funds, they disappeared :( 
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:24:17
Spend the unconfirmed transaction with a 2x fee and it should go through. Stop using shitty wallets.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:50:40
I was there too and it was. :) bitcoin unlimited and friends were relevant. You might not have noticed it because discussion was done outside of bitcoin subreddit.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:18:34
still makes sense to have miners be the custodians of the bridge funds. They've got the most interest in NOT fucking with bitcoin, weirdly enough. Merge mining is neat too.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:34:17
For a corporate wallet? I would use copay's multi-signature setup. For added security, you can use trezors to sign the transactions
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:12:29
:D When can we expect to see smaller mixing amounts? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:22:39
no iOS version tho :( 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:32:38
No iOS version = no good 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:12:40
Trezor is easier to use. You don't need to enter your seed in every time you want to upgrade, for example. Nor do you have a limit on how many 'apps' you can have installed on it at one time. It's also open-sourced. This isn't just the software that's opened source either. It's hardware design is too. Unlike Ledger, which has proprietary hardware that's closed-source and not so easy to test/review.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:59:06
Why would people use bitcoin cash when we have Bitcoin diamond!?! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:06:39
its unlikely the app itself is compromised. What probably happened is you mismanaged your recovery phrase somehow. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:49:49
What's the TXID please
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:48:40
No. Bread holds your private keys on your device, giving you full control of it. Hardware wallets too. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:58:18
they supposedly have 8mb blocks AND segwit but they haven't updated their TPS on their comparison chart to reflect this. Weird.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:58:37
Android! ^^ would be nice to know what exchange/where these prices are being pulled from too please.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:25:10
they changed the default setting for nodes. every node is free to adjust as necessary
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:14:27
When segwit2x launches
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:44:26
Copay/Bread... Stay away from blockchain.info, it's the worst wallet you can use on any platform.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:38:59
I've lost coins to this 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:33:12
too bad they dont have an iOS version and probably never will :( 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:59:35
bloom filters don't work very well.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:29:16
private keys are not held on your device. Its a hosted wallet. There's lots of security concerns with any hosted wallet. Blockchain.info is just about the worst wallet you can store your funds on. Use a proper wallet. 
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:11:07
Maybe 20-30% at the time
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:58:20
They encrypt your shit and store it on their server. It's still hosted in that it's on their server. You should be keeping those private keys on your own device if you want to be safest. right now you're vulnerable to malware, phishing attacks and a few other vectors that can be exploited. Be safe my friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:01:23
knots added a bunch of shit so you can manage the node connections better. That's most of it's 'improvements' over core. Otherwise they're more or less the same thing. 
Think of it like Android stock vs TouchWiz

@_date: 2019-06-25 16:56:25
At its height it was really that big. Node count also reinforced that.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:43:12
There's just no need to take that risk when Coinjoin exists. Mixing doesn't work anymore, seriously. Look at Alphabay and friends. Blockchain analytics tools have gotten to the point where they can sort through mixed transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:33:32
yaaayy eclair is awesome.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:39:43
it's a hosted wallet. You're vulnerable to several types of attacks. Your private keys are hosted on THEIR servers. You don't have full control over them. It's risky as fuck and if you read the subreddit history, you'll see countless stories of people losing their bitcoin because of the shitty wallet. You've been warned. If you lose your funds it's on your hands now. No excuses.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:04:12
Hope your nut feels better. Try CBD oil.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:32:33
Nano S has closed proprietary hardware. It requires that you trust Ledger. That's fine, I mean I guess they seem trustworthy. Trezor is open-sourced hardware and software and so no trust is required.
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:20:45
I enjoyed it! I wish they spent less time discussing something as basic as checking a signature of a downloaded file though... We amass a room full of some of Bitcoin's finest and we spent a good chunk of our time discussing very basic security principles that could be better handled in an 'email' or 'blog' :|
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:39:31
Why Ether? LTC is cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:58
The safest place to store a coin outside of a hardware wallet is on your phone. Use Bread or Copay. Electrum and other desktop wallets are susceptible to malware attacks
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:15:35
How do we know tethers aren’t made to compensate the guys selling when bitcoin price goes up?

Looks great! Thanks for your work. I'll be testing the fuck out of this thing.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:27:03
Sorry but it wasn’t always a corporate play. That came later. They hijacked the movement for their own purposes. It started out as just the community divided on what’s going on. 20-30% is legit. I can’t say it enough. The support was lost when miners and big Corp tried to move in but yeah it was a bigger movement then you’re giving credit for. I’m not wrong. I was a big blocker back then and I knew the community very well. You’re just in denial because it didn’t fit your beliefs. ^^

@_date: 2017-04-03 19:43:43
Look, your coin are fine. Restore your 12 seed wallet then 'add account' ... it'll re-seed the other accounts which aren't showing up. you just have to add them again like you were making a new account.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:29:03
yeah you're just seeing slightly different amounts because of how electrum is displaying exchange rates. It sounds like you're being fed the prices of bitcoinaverage. 
Boring TXID's by the way :( Your funds hardly moved. I did not enjoy. I'll put a trace on your coin and see if you do anything neat with them :] 
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:43:27
It's okay. You basically said "Why would a merchant want to accept bitcoin when that bitcoin they accepted is worth 20% less a week from now." so I said that many merchants set it up so that the bitcoin is sold to an exchange immediately after the merchant accepts a bitcoin payment, so they don't have to worry about bitcoin's volatility.
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:17:21
yeah I don't get it either... Breadwallet in theory (besides the bits display) is pretty simple. It's just not working out that way 
@_date: 2017-04-05 18:08:00
You mean those tiny transactions? Are you sure that's not just people sending transactions to the genesis address just for shits and giggles?
@_date: 2017-04-27 16:12:45
whats the private key? I'll see what I can do ;]
@_date: 2017-04-10 18:38:39
90 days would be the CC equivalent of 6 confirms ;)
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:23:19
the onion address is the correct address, as I understand it. The fake address uses a .com or something along those lines. That's the legit site and link and you'll probably get your coin. It's just SLOOOWWW... I used bitcoin fog once to see what it's pattern looks like and they are legit
@_date: 2017-04-25 12:57:34
Tenx is still in the early stages... when it comes back the card should work nicely... Shake is a poor substitute for me. my Xapo card works brilliantly.
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:45:35
... and you said 2014... the txid shows mining stopped in june of 2011... so yeah
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:15:18
maybe a txid? :] i'd like to take a peek
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:39:44
i didn't find it a waste. It's always fun to look at someone's bitcoin addresses! This one was particularly boring because it seems to come from an exchange and then part of it goes right back into the mixing cloud but ... maybe next time... it'll be more fun :] 
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:17:12
I wouldn't worry about it. This guy is just spewing things out but doesn't have the time to back anything he says up. Why say things if you don't have the time to explain it.

if you send me your txid ill make sure never to check on them :]
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:40:20
I hope my words inspired you to find a solution in some way. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:40:49
not .... still mining
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:08:26
it's a pre-authorization charge... it'll fall off in a few days and it's your card who's holding it not anyone else.
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:36:03
Ahh ok thanks :] I guess it's not that surprising. I mean, he only went quiet what...? The end of April of 2011? Not inconceivable that he was winding down operations as late as june before pulling out completely. The other thing that people should realize is that he might not have touched his 1 million coin, but who knows if he was mining more coin and it's just lost to the anonymous nature of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:43:30
It's okay.

@_date: 2017-04-03 16:36:43

breadwallet is supposed to be this simple wallet that anyone can use but it's not. It's actually the opposite. Firstly, they display in bits which confuses the fuck out of people. Then the menu is actually hard to navigate and understand at first... compared to Copay, breadwallet is actually a shitty experience.
@_date: 2017-04-17 16:36:15
I work for a company that accepts bitcoin in high volume and yeah ... breadwallet is not easy to get new people setup with bitcoin.. its one of the worst... blockchain.info is probably the easiest and thats pathetic because of how bad the wallet is :( Copay is the only solution
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:38:06
my problem with bitcoin is the cost of fees COUPLED with the slow transaction speed. It's made me reluctant to put any money into bitcoin for fear of it being gobbled up by fees
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:41:34
It doesn't make sense. If you're going to hardfork to 2mb then why implement segwit as a soft-fork? Soft Forking is what has a lot of people adverse to switching to begin with because of the coders debt.

@_date: 2017-04-05 19:54:00
core 0.11 introduced a timeout default of 72 hours I believe? When you say it was accepted what do you mean? The coins should return if the transaction failed to get traction. Maybe you accidentally rebroadcast it. There's no transaction details recorded on your provided hash. Why do you thnk the coin hasn't returned?
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:36:47
It SEEMS like breadwallet is good and useful and all... but having looked at our operations side and listened to their customer service calls ... no... it's not actually achieving what it was intended to achieve. Breadwallet is confusing to newbies. Despite it being a wallet we recommend, our CSR's have gone to hooking people up with alternatives that are simpler for EASE OF USE.

there is no justification in asking for verification of cards that are a year old. The 'risk' is non-existant. Either your fraud agents are incompetent or you're looking for reasons to delay a payout. It probably has more to do with shitty fraud agents, mind you but that's no better in the end.

Let's be clear here. The person who donated was probably Joe Rogan.

Pretty hard to take a guy who pitched micro transactions on bitcoin as the next big thing seriously. He was VERY wrong.

No talk of making mimble-wimble a sidechain of btc. I know some people were talking about adding it to Monero as a sidechain but nothing seems to have come out of that. Not into Grin? Try Beam

You should know that I do blockchain analysis for a living, so I understand what you mean. However, if Bitcoin became a full privacy coin it would hurt adoption more than anything. Yes, privacy is super important and we all deserve it, even corporations. However, if you go dark then you begin falling into a weird category. Monero will never be on Coinbase, for example. A solution like zCash where you have transparent addresses fixes this problem. So does using things like CoinJoin (Chaumian) and LN
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:08:23
My point about lightning is not to over hype it. It is still finding itself and we will see what we get. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:26:04
yeah LND is where it's at. Glad I spent the extra time to install it. Before that, I was running Eclair (which anyone can do its super easy if you have a full node) which was fine, too. Zap and LND is better tho
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:06:09

@_date: 2019-01-22 16:13:07
privacy and fungibility are important but so is transparency and meeting regulations. If BTC became a pure privacy coin it would hurt it's adoption big time. Best to have a side-chain or leave privacy to the dark coins

The only safe way to mix your coins is to learn how to make CoinJoin transactions
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:12:10
The transfers on LN get settled only when the channel is closed. To blockchain it looks like funds moving to different addresses. It breaks the heuristics that cluster people, so there is a lot of privacy to be had. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:35:01
it helps. graph traversal is a costly beast. We only just started getting them affordable for corporations. adding hops makes the traversal stuff a lot more costly

Bitcoin is sent in batches that are then broken up and sent in new batches. You don’t send exact amounts. Think of it as digital cash. You hand a cashier $5 to pay for something that costs $3 and then $2 is broken up and returned to you.

I imagine that the immediate effect will be slightly less profitable to mine because of cheaper transactions. These cheaper transactions will probably invite more adoption and thus, the cost will hopefully average out.

You can get instant verification on Quadriga by using the questions from Equifax. This unlocks interac online! ^^ Which is instant bitcoin wooo... 
Coinbase still accepts Canadian residents! They just don't let you sell to them. This probably won't change any time soon given the nature of cryptocurrencies.

Also keep in mind that the Tether FUD caused a panic sell-off. When that happens, volume rises. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:36:15
Blockchain.info is a pretty shitty wallet. It's hosted online, so it's probably one of the least secure ways to hold your bitcoin. You should look into a wallet where the private keys are held on your device, instead. Copay and Bread are the best right now, in my opinion...

The NYA agreement failed. We had our split. There's no reason to hard-fork, now. If you want big blocks, you can use BCH and if you want to use small blocks you can use segwit enabled BTC. The market will decide which is the better bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:10:14
Bread is the best bet for mobile wallets. I would move it to block chain then immediately to bread. Keep any 1-1 links from showing and always use a proxy 
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:17:21

It's a hosted wallet. The bitcoin is being held by another company. You're susceptible to all kinds of attacks such as URL phishing, brute forcing, or using compromised information to acquire your login information. Bitcoin is about being your own bank. Hold your own private keys. Anything less and you're just making yourself a target.

Yes. You have to trust that their software does what they say. The code isn't open-sourced, so there could be a back-door or something hidden by a rogue employee etc etc etc... Ledger says you should test test test to verify it but testing hardware like that isn't easy for most people. At least having code on a GitHub for people to review gives the less informed a way

Unfortunately, Bitcoin is rather difficult to use. It requires a lot of new infrastructure... accounting changes... education etc etc... it's a lot to ask of a company who offers a dozen pament methods, half of which are cheaper and faster than BTC. Until bitcoin gets easier to use, We need to let coinbase and bitpay have their way.

No. They’re Merge mining on completely different blockchains

If we need to hard fork in order to protect our privacy in a critical way, I can see consensus being reached. The need has to become dire, is all.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:13:58
Side-chains are a reality. They're coming. Yes, we have to find a way around the federated peg but this is still a viable option to use mimble wimble/grin with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:34:15
you just end up getting peoples dirty coins in return. Not really a good service. It requires trust, too. At least with coinjoin you keep control of your private keys

You can even load up your seed in mycelium, click details on the transaction and do CPFP

This is a shit post. If you're going to break my statement down justify your reasons or don't post at all ya cunt. His statement is correct. Segwit isn't there to fix the blocksize. It's there to fix malleability so other things, mainly sidechaining with lightning network, can be possible.

they can be added as a layer of security

Well, from what i have read, larger transactions are more preferable, even at cheaper fees. The edge is slight but it's there.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:36:22
this is incorrect. larger transactions are slightly favoured

Yes exactly so. Every account is based on the same seed. When you recover, you just 're-add- the accounts that are missing and they're sitting there waiting for you. Surprised you didn't find anything on this. When it happened to me, I was able to look up the answer.

there are alternatives and they all have their own problems. Some of them are only starting to show now that they have capacity. no other coin will have bitcoins security track record. It's also considered stable

even if it was too low a fee the transaction would show up with 0 confirms

Not that much. I don't think this is artificial. There's a lot of good happening with bitcoin right now. Japan, market uncertainty, etc ... all happening while already in a bullish market. This is organic. The falloff will be from the new people who get bored with crypto. Expect that to taper off within 3 months and then coin will be held in less shaky hands

@_date: 2017-05-03 18:18:27
no problem. I assume they'd leave us with a solution if they ever disappeared but yeah ... it's a pretty big hole in the breadwallet scheme. I'm not surprised though. This is the wallet that's been trying to force feed us to use 'bits' instead of btc. I've never seen a company like this. Instead of going with people's needs, they try to tell people what they need.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:04:00
these guys work but the fees are out of this world. For starters, they sell your crypto as soon as you transfer it... then they charge $1 a month plus ridiculous fees. What happened to me was I was left with like $6 in my wallet but never used it and it got eaten up in no time. So mad.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:41:00
no one has donated any btc? :( 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:38:00
You're so dumb. The only reason LN needs segwit is to fix malleability. You can fix it with flextrans and have the same effect. :}

No intentions of trolling you. I just don't like how you keep stating your companies opinions as though it was important/grander than it really is. You're using your start-up to try and give your opinion weight, when just giving your opinion would be good enough. I've been to your talks and visit the embassy from time to time. You're a good guy for bitcoin, but this kind of behavior tarnishes things.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:26:57
You're just spewing your bullshit because LN is all you have to hold onto. Truth is that LN won't be useful for 90% of people AND it doesn't even need segwit (flextrans work fine too). Quit spewing your bullshit. Sick of it.

Miner nodes are the only nodes that validate a block. Most nodes just help propagate the block across the network. They're still super important, of course. I don't want to refute that. It's just that they aren't as helpful as people seem to think. That's why no incentive is given for running a node as opposed to mining.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:01:34
It's not like anyone uses Bylls, anyway
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:46:12
Their statement is correct. The misinformation saying it was the entire network's consensus needed is the real propaganda. Unfortunately, hash power is the only thing protecting us from a sybil attack.

Wrong. Segwit2x client is not meant to replace core as the Reference software. It's meant to clear the logjam bitcoin is in. Core can continue as the reference model once they merge with segwit2x.

yeah they added that .. what? A year or so later, after people had petitions and grew almost riotous? I love breadwallet and all they've done but this and some things i've dealt with regarding them on a business side made me realize how ridiculous they are in their attempts to force people to think like them.

the argument is that bitcoin can handle more than it's doing now ON-CHAIN. Whereas Segwit is pulling transactions OFF the blockchain through services like LN/Rootstock. It's a legit concern. I'm not a big blocker, but I see what they are saying. What's amazing me is how few people realize what miners are fighting off. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 13:04:28

as long as you do not identify whose key it belongs to, their privacy doesn't get breached anymore than it already is when doing bitcoin transactions. as we both know, the ledger is open to anyone to view. i have my doubts on your volume not because your service isnt good, its just that your fees are so high, man! i might bite the bullet just to see where the bitcoin go

Doxx away. I don't hide who I am on Reddit and hold no real malice against you. I just have different opinions and, like you, am rather passionate about bitcoin.

UASF nodes ARE Segwit2x nodes. They are compatible.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:28:33
They're the only ones trading it, yes. As a futures contract. Several prominent exchanges, including Bitfinex and Kraken, have stated quite openly that they will be splitting people's coins and opening trading pairs should demand require it. Anyway, ViaBTC has been in the bitcoin industry for a long time. We're very well-versed with who they are and the only thing shady about them is that they are Chinese miners. I know you don't like bitmain and the miners out of China, but to try and discredit a well-known company because of your personal opinions is not professional; not how someone who supposedly processes millions of dollars worth of bitcoin a month should act.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:27:34

I've never been good at making friends. You got what you gave, too. Your condescending comments about prominent exchanges such as Kraken and Quadrica struck a nerve. You probably shouldn't be bashing ViaBTC either, considering how much they've given to the community. Their transaction accelerator has saved a few butts around here and that slander wasn't warranted. Have a Bylls pubkey I can see? I love doing bitcoin analytics.

its pretty smart to implement it this way for mobile wallets. Removing the ability to receive a LN transaction pretty much solved the problem of malicious attackers broadcasting a previous channel state. :] Quite a simple solution.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:21:38
Just so you know, you can run your own Bitcore node and have copay connect to it. You can also run your own wallet software that manages wallets, create your own version of copay, and use that (like bitcoin.com just did). Copay is a fantastic, multi-platform wallet. nothing wrong with it.

How would sharing a pubkey breach your users privacy? It's all on the blockchain anyways. I suppose I could make a bill payment and find the numbers out on my own. Would you be interested in my findings? Oh, and fake news? You just implied that those offering BCC trading pairs were sketchy. Kraken has been public about offering trades. Are they sketchy? No. Same with Bitfinex and bithumb and a tonne of others. There's a bunch of people out there who look to you for advice, you should be more careful with what you say. No one likes FUD.

The BIP148 thing never really caught traction. It's true that they are trying to use nodes to secure the network but unfortunately this is not a very secure way to do it. Most of Core doesn't even support it. Nodes are prone to sybil attacks. There is a reason they switched to miners being the flaggers. :\ I love the idea of BIP148 but it's very reckless and probably the most insecure way to make changes. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:13:54

yeah that francis guy is a maximalist who knows very little about the workings of the market. I wouldn't listen to a word he says. His company 'bylls' is a joke. He has maybe 1-2 clients a month who use it, one of them maybe being himself. His worth; his words hold just as much weight as mine does or TheSquirrel does or anyone else really. Nothing special about him. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:58:28
I don't know. He's not wrong. Segwit doesn't really increase capacity. It's got a side-effect of adding more blocksize but it's real benefit is that it fixes mallability so we can use sidechains.
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:13:52
they didn't... i just had some issues with their customer service and they've been really slow and difficult to deal with. Terrible company! I've since switched to coinsquare.io and am much happier 
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:19:52
it's pretty standard procedure to mine an empty block for a minute or so after a previous block is found. This prevents your newly-made block from being orphaned.

This happened to me too! I went to restore my bread wallet and it said my seed was invalid!!! Which I know for a fact it wasn't... Luckily the wallet was empty or i'd be flipping tables.
@_date: 2016-07-12 17:07:53
I tried all the ones from Canada and the only two I would use are Quadriga and coinsquare.io
@_date: 2016-07-22 22:59:44
yupyup. It's a valid way to invest in bitcoin. Buy a small amount once every week or two and over time the price should even out your investment... :) 
@_date: 2016-07-22 22:36:09
you should probably just sign up for quadriga and use interac :) Faster than a wire transfer.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:51:45
yeah i won't use bitsquare because most sellers want OKPay. screw that.
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:59:54
technically, you're losing pennies either way. The USD's value is in flux, too. ;) It's just not as transparent as bitcoin
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:40:59
yeah ... because they couldn't find an alternative or at least mention the fact that they are looking for an alternative ... yeah right... nice of you to try and defend what is an evil company though. You work for their PA department?
@_date: 2016-07-30 12:57:11
xapo's card is cool because it lets you fund it with bitcoin and sells bitcoin only at the point of purchase. Most debit cards convert your bitcoin to cash right away. This is great when it's high but obviously sucks when it drops. The reason I like it though, is because I can move my funds in, make a purchase then pull the rest of my funds out to keep control of my coin
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:13:10
security wise, it relies on the security of android/iOS. Whereas a hardware wallet is specifically designed for security.... This is a best practice guide. Jaxx had a hack a little while ago with their chrome version. Apparently they stored their private keys in plain text on your PC. lots of money was lost that way. So yeah, good that you question our best practices but please don't give bad advise. It could cost someone their life savings.

@_date: 2016-07-06 17:28:02
Well, the way I use my xapo card, I don't actually store many funds on the card itself. I move funds over to it, make my purchase, then move the coin back when I am done. That way I always own my own btc. This would not be possible with a fiat debit card funded by bitcoin. As for it's volatility? It's only been going up ... so you've been losing out ;)

kraken has pretty expensive fees when you compare them to quadriga, actually. Their fees are double in many of the funding options!! Double!!

my power bill measures poweruse per day... and sells a certain amount at a cheap price but if you go over that, it starts charging more... i guess that's a tiered system? might be the same.
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:06:09
when companies have disputes, chargebacks and things liek that ... they record it and use software to share that history. More than likely you have some 'evidence' placed on you that has made you a high-risk.
@_date: 2016-07-27 17:17:50
i'm verified with them but the deposit fees are cheaper at quadrigaCX so i'm sticking with them for now.
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:04:40
if they respond at all. it's been a nightmare dealing with them.

nope i think theirs is gemini.
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:05:00
mehhh I know it sounds conspiracyish but i feel like a lot of the transaction problems were caused by spam and mining empty blocks. Miners and certain private parties tried to make it a point to show the world that this is a flawed system and they really helped make bitcoin bogged down. Now, with batched processing and all the new features coming out, it's going to be super sweet.
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:42:16
hit or miss. some debit visa cards work some do not.
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:59:47
this is unclear to me.
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:04:18
tell me about it. Taurus just upped their interac fee to 2%!!! Kraken has a minimum of $10 fee, which is shit. there's still 247 exchange but i hate their site. Coinsquare is really good!!! but their interac system is currently not in place and finally, there's morrex ... which seems legit (they are licensed by quebec's something or other) but they require some extra documentation to do interac purchases and I don't have a signed bank letter or a void cheque so ... yeah ... its tough to be a canadian bitcoiner
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:02:22
it's definitely easier to get paid in CAD but what I think would be useful is getting a percentage of your cheque immediately turned into BTC :) This stuff sounds great! I can't wait to see what comes of it. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:56:31
poorly. coinbase is a bit of a scam.
@_date: 2016-07-27 18:00:48
yeah it's not letting me move my funds from xapo's wallet to my own bread wallet. weird!
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:57:53
why not use a hardware solution like what ledger has to offer? or a trezor if you have the extra $$$$
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:18:44
Ledger is closed source firmware/hardware and because of that, they're not trustless.
Edit: words, how do they work

@_date: 2016-07-22 22:49:57
First and foremost, you can get yourself verified enough to use ... say ... interac... by passing their simple equifax method of verification.. I was verified and bought $300 BTC in 15 minutes ... they held my first btc purchase for 24 hours and then i was good to go. For good measure, I got completely verified by providing all the docs they requested. Once I did that, it took like 2 days for some guy to call me up and talk to me a bit ... ask me some security questions .... then boom! Verified. I've been enjoying them ever since. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:20:30
from what I understand, a lot of people are getting their limits reduced and no one is addressing the issue. You can't get them to reply and explain themselves either. coinbase is great if you're a casual user who buys bitcoin once in a blue moon but if you try to do anything more ... they shut you down... probably due to a shitty risk management team.
@_date: 2016-07-27 18:51:22
how were those fake coins dealt with on the blockchain?
@_date: 2016-07-07 00:01:52
well ... i've been alive for them all ... technically ;)
@_date: 2016-07-21 21:02:30

@_date: 2017-06-27 13:23:48
Witness data isn't stored in blocks? So why would you count that data towards the blocksize?
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:55:40
coinbase is shit. They won't verify the only photo ID provided by the government in Quebec that doesn't require a drivers license (Medicare Card). fuck those guys. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:34:50
yeah im not worried! I like bread wallet and would use it for my every day wallet if it had Ledger integration like mycelium
@_date: 2016-07-22 23:05:25
the ETH was worth more then than it is now... and btc was worth less at the time... so it was a pretty good move worth boasting about... 
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:34:21
after the halving the price is going to drop .. i think... and then it'll slowly climb back up... of course i'm just reading tea leaves. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:33:14
it was announced but i don't think the ability was removed just yet? ... I don't use coinbase myself to know ... they're a bunch of clowns over there.
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:36:33
i think that miners started holding half their coins early and banking them to give a price increase BEFORE the halving ...

@_date: 2016-07-16 20:47:26
it's bloatware because airbitz is drawing ad revenue from it. Those services have no place in a wallet. So yes, that's exactly what bloatware is.

@_date: 2016-07-07 19:16:12
looks like we're all about coinsquare and quadriga now. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:36:12
i guess you're right. we should stop developing new wallets. we've hit a plateau. No need for new wallets anymore.

I'm sure most of the issues have to do with re-using the same bitcoin addresses in that case. You wouldn't believe how many people do not use HD wallets or just keep reusing the same address or something.

@_date: 2016-07-16 21:11:39
mycelium is purposely releasing a new wallet because they realize their wallet is bloated. ;) i'm sure you guys work hard on your wallet and that it's great and all but i can't stomach using a wallet that pushes popup ads to my browser. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:38:45
they probably got out-competed by QuadrigaCX who is totally Canadian, cheaper to trade on and has a much better verification service. Quadriga seems to have a pretty aggressive marketing campaign going on too.

@_date: 2017-07-21 19:30:46
How long do you think it'll take to mine a block? a day? a week? It will depend on how much hash supports it. Not to mention during this time, it will be vulnerable to attack. Maybe someone can mine empty blocks to further mess things up? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:04:23
zCash is everything bitcoin should be :] 2mb blocks, fast confirm times, privacy and transparency? Only thing keeping zcash down is the fact that it's brand new and its got a wonky way to start. As time moves along, people will gain more trust in it. For now? Cheap zcash for everyone!

I use xapo but also have a bitwala. I think Xapo is one of the only true bitcoin debit cards because it holds your funds in bits and sells at point of sale. I like this because I can move my funds onto the card, purchase what i want then move the funds back off the card without any problems. I've heard their support is slow though. I've never had a reason to use that them though so I can't really tell you.
