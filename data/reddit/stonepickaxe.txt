Whoops. Math is hard. (I saw the $2000 comment above and did my math with that)

Damn. People exploit anything they can, don't they.
I feel like there need to be safeguards in place to prevent something like this happening, as it causes people who aren't used to the market fluctuating to sell out and lose money. Not that I have any idea what that solution could be.
EDIT: On further thought, no, I don't think something like that is necessary as it could quickly turn BTC into a heavily regulated currency, which is the exact opposite of its goal.

30 minutes now. What the hell

Bitfloor is down right now too.
EDIT: Nevermind, it's back up now. Phew!

Worth nothing compared to the (potentially) $600,000 you could have had.

I went from .71 coins to .76 coins by selling/buying! I feel happy, even though that's next to nothing to some of you guys. This is just a fun hobby for me.

I managed to finally sell today at $200 apiece. I had to transfer all my coins to bitfloor as Mtgox was shitting all over the place. SO glad I sold when I did, waiting to buy back in when it stabilizes.

Which is an absolute in itself, ironically

2300s lag.. SELL ALL YOUR COINS

I wish I hadn't spent all of my ~$30 BTC on drugs.

I hit it a few times and I'm assuming it got added to a queue. I'll just leave it for 10 minutes and see if it's still there.
