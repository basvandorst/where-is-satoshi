Exactly, but while they're putting up their statist legislation for comment, we should try to make it less statist for those who are 'in the middle' as it were if we can. Simply not dealing is a terrible idea.

That's like what they did to the late Alaskan senator. Hammered them with felony charges, so people wouldn't vote for him, and later they said 'hey guys! They aren't guilty.' Conveniently after the elections were over... The senator who won is up for re election soon, however..

@_date: 2014-09-08 22:30:48
In what way? I think it's funny because we will be using coinbase, a form of bitcoin bank and a third party to use paypal to use another service, when the service could easily just cut paypal out of the picture for bitcoin by going straight for bit pay instead of anything else.
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:30:22
2% is the inflation rate, on paper.
Here's the problem- we're spending money we don't have, creating inflation in that it's not based on real paper money. Student loan for 200k+ ? Approved! I've never heard of someone being denied money for a student loan because the gvt met the quota of loans to hand out.
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:23:03
Think about it this way, though. In the taxi service, people don't generally make much money hour-per-hour. I'd rather have someone that's decently paid because of an artificially restricted market than someone that's barely making minimum wage due to super low cost of entry. (just put a taxi sign on top of your car and go) That said, I don't agree with everything that goes along with it....

I like bitcoin because I can go to a 7/11 in Mexico and buy stuff without problem. ;)
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:23:06
I agree, but I think it takes more to understand why it could fail.
The major weakness of bitcoin is its network. If its crypto security is demolished or its hashing power gets overtaking by a malevolent force, it could potentially destroy bitcoin.
 I think this would be coming with/before the halvening, not after. I don't know the technicalities, but the cost of the miners is probably a lot, so at whatever point where the miners lose their money, is when btc dies.

I've read all these posts about Bitcoin and am invested in it, but if you really care about bitcoin, you should put effort into understanding the problem a bit more before you post. 
Everyone here is trying to offer solutions, and there's varying ideas and solutions to something that we aren't really sure is even a problem.
How big should it be right now? How many people should be using it versus how many do right now? The protocol has only been live for about 5 years, and every high-ranking official in businesses and the government (US at least) has heard of it... As far as I can tell, the common person (that's not tech-oriented) may have heard of it briefly in the u.s., but only as part of the daily background noise. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:09:55

@_date: 2014-09-09 07:08:55
Even if that is the case... I see this as locking me as a user into paypal and coinbase, eliminating the benefits of paypal entirely.  That is if I dont need an account to buy through btc.

@_date: 2014-10-23 01:45:35
Not really. "Room for maturity" would be to leave it at the dollars-per-bits (or .01 decimal point), not the thousands of bits per dollar. We would have to hit well into the 5-figure range per bitcoin for it to make a big difference.
@_date: 2014-08-15 07:56:42

I love bitcoin, but I think the community right now is being more belligerent than helpful. These are statists we're dealing with. We shouldn't say 'all or nothing' we need to propose actual options to them that at least keeps us in the loop- the easier it is for everyone to get into bitcoin, the better. 
We need to hit critical mass before giving the finger to legislation.

I'm actually really interested in that, haha.
@_date: 2014-08-28 17:11:02
Think about it this way. If you aren't the one to stop being intolerant, it's a never ending cycle of intolerance that further segregates us from each other.
I see no reason to stay away from people simply because they are "intolerant" unless they are directly rude or offensive to you in person. I have no reason to assume I'm going to get jumped by a black guy just because he's black, for example. 
I might disagree with another person, but that doesn't mean we can't be friends. And perhaps along the way, I can help them leave their comfort zone.

Know your customer laws are required when you are the person holding an account in behalf of another, ie banks. Companies that require you to register an account with them, or for whom represents you when you do business, are required to comply.
If you as an individual, however, represent yourself and purchase directly (not through an account) you are typically exempt from kyc. Especially if you treat the terminal less like a bank with an account than like a direct sales model, you ought to be exempt, depending on where you live, as every state/country has different laws.
The legality of one one way or the other has yet to be determined within a court of law, however. I pity the first person who gets into a lawsuit over these classifications of bitcoin ATMs with their state.
@_date: 2014-09-09 07:05:02

@_date: 2014-09-23 15:58:03


Not everyone will give up on the coin. As the mining co's drop out, individuals will start mining again to fill in the gap, as they can afford to both mine while making a comparative loss on the coin.

It's up from previous highs of 50 bucks. If the starting point is 1000 and that's where you bought in then, sure, but before that, you could purchase a ton of coins for less.

IS the Xbit large enough? I think it denotes a unit that's wayy too small personally, and will, in the end DAMAGE bitcoin. 1 unit costing 30 is much more digestible than 1 unit costing less than 1 penny.
I think the Bitcoin foundation or whomever is using this designation makes a mistake.

I don't. It's a solid company that's getting back up on their feet.

Purchase in semi-large chunks as compared to your income. I'm purchasing bit by bit as the price slips (no more than 1x a week though as that would kill my income xD).
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:35:49
I get more and more happy with okcoin as you guys keep going on. I like it a lot, and hope that you can bring acceptance of bitcoin to the manufacturers!
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:28:17
Every time i buy the price slips just a tad bit. Then it slips some more. I feel your pain. Just hodl your coins. You may be upset, but don't sell.

Remember the spikes to 1,000? And if that's not it, then there's another thing we haven't discussed as thoroughly: purchasing coins directly from miners. If a wallstreeter wants coins, i'm sure they could just get it from a mining company/pool directly.
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:58:50
yeah, my email is 2-factor, just gotta get coinbase set up.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:23:04
It's like 3 step auth with the retarded email thing, too. You have authorized me from my phone and password, coin base. Now my email, too? What's wrong with these guys?

Rich people can still be benefitted because they have things called assets.

There's a whole host of issues. Is the question adoption? Ease of access to btc w/out totalitarian level kyc laws.
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:09:00
I agree with you - I love bitcoin, but I think the community right now is being more belligerent than helpful. These are statists we're dealing with, they're going to use force sooner or later.
 We shouldn't say 'all or nothing' - as it contributes nothing to the discussion and makes us seem like the idiots. We need to propose actual options to them that at least keeps us as part of the process- the easier it is for everyone to get into bitcoin, the better.
We need to hit critical mass before giving the finger to statists.
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:53:42
All i have is dollars. How get bitcoin without giving away identity?

Well, as long as we're within the system, may as well do what we can to make it harder for them to state. Any person that wants to purchase from typically state-legitimate businesses should be happy for the bitcoin foundation.

In theory it should be lower, shouldn't it? I heard the black market rates were completely different with peso vs usd than 'official' exchanges...
@_date: 2014-08-21 14:17:22
What they do with that btc is still a major question.

I'm actually interested in that point. If the "computer nerds" who brought us the iPhone, google search, Siri, and other amazing things that have, and are, transforming the world get into bitcoin, it will be quite an unstoppable force.
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:49:46
I tried to buy .25 on coinbase, but the exchange rate changed so i had to click 'confirm' - this changed 3 times, with a variation of 5 cents between each attempt to purchase. Well, we'll see how it goes I guess.... 
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:44:34


I would LOVE to see them get rid of banker's regulations so they can compete with the Bitcoin network-
I love the paper that posted the link to, as under their (the banks') very own mention they state:


disintermediation of traditional payment networks, promoting shadow transacting.
They are seriously stating they know outright that traditional payment networks could be destroyed, as could visa be destroyed by an ApplePay linked to your bank account. Only this is without a bank.
it's hilarious!
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:27:35
Now, seeing as doge ain't coming back up.
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:48:15
Bitcoin doesn't need any new regulations per se, with the public ledger, it needs even less. Typical Anti-Money Laundering Laws for exchanges and banks should be all that's needed for bitcoin. It shouldn't need any extra licensing to use it or anything of that nature.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:43:44

Not really. It's much too large of a division.

Very awesome idea! I'll keep that in mind for my ventures!

You'd lose quite a lot on transaction fees, it's called a 'dust attack' or something like that. Are you prepared to lose a significant amount of coin?

Sending bitcoin from one wallet to another is kinda what I had in mind, but my first-hand experience is that it takes about 10 minutes for my wallet to see that there is an 'unconfirmed' transaction.

But the wallet takes 10 minutes to register that there's even an amount of btc incoming?
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:28:21
Now that I think about it, the lack of the ability of a chargeback should make customers more willing to do their homework *before* they make a purchase... Less impulse buys because you can't get it back, so the consumer has to take more responsibility. Bitcoin is definitely better for businesses than for the impulsive consumer.
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:24:31
Paid shills. Look at the article on the guys posting history. That's all he does is bash bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:22:11
ALSO to add to it, some major suppliers are saving some of the bitcoin as it grows in its adoption rates.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:17:10

Exactly. It seems also to help us with another thing- diversification of the btc hashing pie.

In the immediate realm.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:37:30
This needs significantly more attention imho.
@_date: 2014-08-10 22:17:46
Then why does it take 10 minutes for it to be seen from coinbase to my home wallet? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:25:28
Btc e lets you sell the coins you don't have tho.
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:12:28

No, there is no marketing on behalf of bitcoin that catches on. There's plenty of incentive. No marketing. It's the one weakness behind the p2p coin.

That has nothing to do with moving from coinbase to a home wallet with bitcoin-qt??????
@_date: 2014-08-22 23:15:06
No, I just don't understand the premise. And you don't understand my question. No one here seems to be very good at explaining things simply and understandably.
You're saying they want to tax btc like a product, not like a currency?
@_date: 2014-08-10 19:45:19


As long as that is a problem we're goin to have issues with getting people on board.
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:00:49
That is how it's treated, anyway.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:00:16
Don't forget, the Feds may end up selling dpr's bitcoin of 100k plus. That could crush us.

@_date: 2014-08-12 16:22:11
Very interesting! I know where to start when it comes to searching up my bitcoin atm now!
The thing about the laws is that i'm talking specifically u.s. laws- With the regulations of bitcoin as non-currency by the IRS, i think it could legitimately be argued that cash directly for bitcoin is a reasonable and legal option. 
Nevertheless, I don't have the funds if that ever actually did go to court.
@_date: 2014-08-30 10:48:58
Ehhhhh but I think that takes it too far imo.
@_date: 2014-07-26 06:23:59
We're playing a difficult game here for any significant holder of bitcoin, in all honesty. We need so much infrastructure...
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:47:45
Hold on there, satan.
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:46:06
Wow, they even have the state's licenses. Very interesting! At any rate, however, I'll just purchase and have my coins now (I don't have much money to put in to hedge anyways)
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:15:29
I see nothing of value on this article. It's so cryptic. I believe in bitcoin but I see nothing here indicating anything special about ebay or bitcoin, or paypal even.

Does this mean anything to Ulbricht since the evidence was illegal?
@_date: 2015-04-03 08:59:30
It may be irrelevant, but with the use of the unfair prosecution practices I do think Ulbricht has a right to argue for a reduced sentence.
