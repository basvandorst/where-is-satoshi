Stay away from Kraken. They have terrible support and their "stop-loss" on their trading system has failed (coincidentally) on the 2 biggest crashes of the year.
I got rekt partially on the big crash at the start of January and once support replied to me 3 weeks later they offered only credits for trade fee's to make up for it. I was assured that they were working hard to make sure this issue didn't happen again. Anyway, I left them for OkCoin because I was not impressed. On Feb 9 when there was another crashed caused by PBoC I saw many Kraken complaints on reddit/twitter because the same thing happened again, and I think it was even more widespread.

If I recall correctly, I think I may have messaged him first after seeing a comment of his on something. And I was turned off immediately after he started replying.
Thank you! :)

The price is going up because it is being adopted by the whole world. It also needs to go up to be taken seriously by most people.

You baited me good.

This mother fucker keeps annoying me on FB, has tried to convince me in the past and it sounded dodgy as fuck so I ignored and deleted it. He messaged again yesterday.

You laugh at me but I don't really care. I'm in this for my own benefit at the end of the day; even though bitcoin will help those in the 3rd world.

Isn't this what happens with all lightning wallets, where they are custodial and you don't get access to private keys?

Why is this so heavily upvoted. Bitcoin is not a currency, it's a store of value and should be HODL'd rather than spent.

This is taking us backwards with regards to the progress we have made in allowing people to have sovereignty over their own money.   
Lets be real here, the interface and UX is a great improvement over what we had previously but it's custodial. It is a bank account.  
KYC to back up my funds? Lol please.

How is this "up over 35% in the last 3 months" when the current hashrate is lower than it was 3 months ago?

Closed source and in addition, it's fully custodial. No private keys and no idea of what goes on in the back-end = no reason for me to use this wallet.

Take whatever these guys say with a grain of salt. Sam Kaz and Michael Sloggett are known con-artists in the local Australian community. This was only one of their scams, where they lured mum and dad investors into their ICO which they used to fund the purchase of ATMs for their ATM network, did not end well for the people who invested. 
60 Minutes Australia did an investigation on them:
