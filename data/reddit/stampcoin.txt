Interestingly I think Hals widowed wife has now dedicated her life now to helping others with ALS when she could just spend the rest of her life on a beach in malibu. I wouldnt be surprised if she was behind the pineapple fund and other anonymous giving!.. What fantastic people!

If you are interested in this form of money, please read more about ripple.com  Any person or entity can become a "ripple gateway" and issue their own IOUs and set their own issuing/redemption policies.  Ripple allows you to send and receive these IOUs digitally with integrity. IOUs can be traded on the ripple network and users themselves get to decide what issuing person/entity IOUs that they trust.  For example, if US Bank became a gateway, you could deposit money at the US bank and they would issue you a digital USD US BANK backed IOUS that you can spend or exchange for other IOUs issued by other gateways.

How does the trading/conversion work? Is there ways for users to participate in the exchange to provide liquidity?

Could it be used for subscription-based services?  There is no way to "pull" money from a bitcoin wallet without a secret key.  I think smart contracts/sidechains could be a way to help solve this problem.

While it's true that with Ripple you also have counterparty risk, in exchange you have a counterparty guarantee. When you have Bitcoins on the Bitcoin network, "all" you have are numbers in other people's computers. You can't sue them or enforce any contract you have with them if something causes your Bitcoins to somehow become lost, and you can't choose your counterparties. With Ripple, you have a counterparty that you chose who is legally responsible for your Bitcoins in accord with whatever contract you have with them.
If the Bitcoin network were to somehow fail to deliver or hold your Bitcoins, you'd be out of luck. If the Ripple system were to somehow fail to deliver or hold your Bitcoins, your chosen gateway would still owe them to you and you would still be able to enforce your redemption agreement with them.
As a practical matter, I don't think it really makes any difference.
