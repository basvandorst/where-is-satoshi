You are going to be a lot better off just avoiding leverage altogether in this situation. I don't see any benefit unless I'm misunderstanding. Simply send the 10k to an exchange like bitstamp or coinbase and buy BTC with it.

I'm mostly confident that the bear market will last far longer than the majority of people can withstand, so whether or not it makes a real recover in a few years is irrelevant. But to your question I would say I don't know - I think there is a strong argument for continues success down the road, as well as still obstacles to overcome to get there.

There's no denying that things seem more obvious in retrospect. But this post wasn't really about having not anticipated a specific price movement, but rather not expecting to be surprised.
I do agree that it's rather vague contemplation, but I actually disagree about it being worthless. As an analogy, If you're sharing a meal with a friend and he says the food tastes off, you'd be reasonable to perhaps stop eating to avoid potential food poisoning. If the same friend, however, is neurotic and says this EVERY meal and you know this, you'd be better served ignoring his complaints entirely. That knowledge of his tendencies becomes beneficial to you.
It's quite the same here, except your "friend" is the entire market, including yourself. If you begin to understand the neurosis of the market you can start to make better decisions. Obviously this doesn't tell you how to trade perfectly, but I believe it is a framework towards understanding the price movements a bit and potentially anticipating them with better accuracy. It becomes easier to expect the same behaviors to occur when you understand the emotions behind them, rather than simply looking at a chart and hoping it plays out in a particular way.

Please read the second part of the definition.
 [ 
I'm not arguing with you that the new definition has detracted from the utility of the word. All I'm saying is that enough people were misusing the word that it's meaning has changed. Merriam Webster is quite an authority on the English language. Other dictionaries consider this an informal usage but acknowledge its widespread usage.
In a similar example, the word decimate was originally meant to mean a 10% loss, or one in ten. Now it is almost ubiquitously used as a synonym for "annihilated". You can chime in and argue "Well actshooallyyy..." but people are just going to find it annoying. Language means what people agree it means, and that can change.

While good practice, his concern isn't necessarily mitigated by offline transaction. If the wallet developers were to code the software in such a way that the private key generation isn't truly random, then they would already have your private key in a predetermined list even before you "generated" it. The critical aspect is the code being open-source and sufficiently reviewed, to ensure the private keys are being generated in a sufficiently random and unpredictable manner.

I'm pretty sure that's exactly how logarithmic graphs work. A vertical segment of set length will be the same $ amount on any point of a linear graph. A vertical segment of set length will be the same % amount on any point of a logarithmic graph. BTC went from about 7 to 1100 in his left box. The right box is saying a similar move would be from about 6.5k to 1m. Both are around 155x returns. Maybe I misunderstood your point as to why it's not a valid copy/paste?

The journalist based his argument on nonsense, basically.  Simply reading the original article was evidence that it was wrong.  When pressed for details (as can be seen in the article I linked), they pretty much gave no evidence and didn't try to argue.  The thing is, the original article didn't really lie. They didn't give any viable evidence to begin with. They just said it was their opinion that it was a single buyer, because that gets clicks. The whole thing was a total joke and it's embarrassing how little stuff gets vetted before rumors like this spread like wildfire. Nobody does their own research whatsoever.

Sure.  I'm a little rusty as I learned the mechanics of it a while ago but I understand the basics for an ELI5.
The bitcoin network is designed to be extremely secure, which is why transactions can take a while and become costly when the network gets crowded.  Lightning Network (LN) is an entirely different type of network, which is somewhat less secure (but theoretically still secure enough) yet has the benefit of being much faster and cheaper.
While LN operates quite differently than Bitcoin, it is *linked* to Bitcoin.  It basically piggie-backs off the security of the Bitcoin network in order to become secure itself.
To use the LN, you'd first acquire BTC on the Bitcoin network as you are familiar with.  You'd then find a friend with BTC, and together you'd "lock" up your BTC, which temporarily freezes them on the Bitcoin network.  These locked BTC are essentially in escrow.  You and your friend now have an open channel on the LN, and can rapidly and cheaply send IOU's to each other up to the amount of your BTC collateral.  If we each locked 1 BTC into escrow, then so long as neither of us exceeds a debt of 1 BTC to the other within the LN, the OIU's are completely redeemable by dipping into those locked-up escrow funds.
What this means is I can send you 0.5 btc, then you send me 1.1 btc, then I sent you 0.2 btc, followed by another 0.6 btc, and you send me 1 btc.  If you do the math, you'll see the IOU total never exceeds 1 BTC for either party.  One of us decides we are done transacting, so that person closes the channel.  The net result of our IOU's is that you owe me 0.8 BTC.  Upon closing the channel, the escrowed funds automatically spring into action on the Bitcoin network, and 0.8 BTC are sent from your address to mine.  You now have 0.2 BTC and I have 1.8 BTC on the normal Bitcoin network and can do whatever we normally would with them.
The real use comes when you start connecting various channels together.  Say I also have a channel open with Amazon on the LN.  Because you are connected to me, and me to Amazon, you can actually send 0.2 worth of IOU's straight to Amazon through me.  You to me, me to Amazon.  The LN automatically processes this without you even needing to trust me, and I don't have to do anything.  This means once enough people are connected on the LN, it will be easy to instantly send IOU's to anyone on the network, and it's all backed by the security of the Bitcoin network itself.

It is in fact true that any given second in the day has a 1/600 chance.  This is different than saying "there is a 1/600 chance of the **next** block coming in exactly 500 seconds."  But if you choose a specific second in the future, there's a 1/600 chance it will have a block.  Every block is independent, and the average is one every 10 minutes, so it's by definition.
The chart on the right is simply the aggregation of every individual second's probability as displayed on the left chart.

The basic answer is that the fee market is exactly that, a free and open market.  The limited amount of blockspace can be used however people want - so long as they pay for it.  If one group of people wish to use it to send 1000's or millions of dollars around the world, and another group wishes to use it to write frivolous messages, who do you suppose will be willing to pay more?
Veriblock is able to pay to use that blockspace, because the space is still quite cheap.  What they are doing is an inefficient use of the blockspace, and free markets are extremely good at removing inefficiencies.  For now, the cost of using the blockspace to transact btc (the fee) will be just higher than what someone like Veriblock can afford to pay to tie their blockchain data into it.  Eventually, there may be so many people wishing to use the space for sending transactions, that fees bid up to a point where it's only useful to use the Bitcoin network for sending large transactions.  This is where solutions such as Lightning Network would hopefully step in to provide a solution for smaller transactions.

But this is an entirely different, complex, and riskier strategy than "Buy tons at $5k and instantly sell at $6k!" which was the misguided strategy outlined by OP.  It's also like saying "Why not just buy at $5k, wait for it to go up to $6k in a few weeks, then sell?".  And the answer to both those would be, well, because it might do the opposite and you'll lose money.

Credit has actually very little to do with the Bitcoin vs Fiat debate.  Credit is simply a centralized system of calculating your risk of defaulting on a loan.  This system could exist for any currency or asset, even platforms like eBay have a "credit" system known as your reputation.
Loans already exist for bitcoin.  I have borrowed and lended BTC with friends, and you can do so in return for interest on some exchanges.
The last question is a matter of opinion, but I personally believe if it succeeds it will do so as a separate asset class.  There have been "world currencies" such as gold for millennia, and they have not prevented government currencies from existing.  While Bitcoin may be more convenient to use and store than gold (which gives argument for why it should exist), it doesn't give reason for why it should result in a different outcome.

The person who wrote that report argued that because there was a large volume spike across all exchanges at the same time, that it was a "synchronized algorithmic buy".  They are insinuating that since the spikes happened at the same time, it must have been some coordinated thing.  The journalist is obtuse, whether it's deliberate or not.
Exchanges go up and down together because that's how markets work.  The only algorithms at work here were arbitrage bots keeping the exchanges close in price.  There's really no evidence to suggest this was anything but a breakout caused by the "market" (as in many participants, not one or two) collectively feeling the same urgency to buy, compounded with cascading bitmex liquidations.

For that amount, assuming it's not a lot of money to you, it's probably fine to leave it there.  In all honesty, you are more likely to lose your wallet in the future than it is Coinbase will go bankrupt or steal them.
However, this is because the amount is small and you likely won't take necessary precautions to secure your cold storage wallet.  For larger amounts, you absolutely would be better served learning how to get a wallet and store them yourself.  If you have interest in acquiring bigger amounts of BTC in the future (to either use or just hold), it'd be in your best interest to start learning now.
So basically, those $250 worth of BTC is likely safest in Coinbase, but your future BTC (if they will exist) will be much better served if you learn how to secure the current ones now.
Hope that makes sense!  Getting a wallet isn't overly complicated if you're interested.
@_date: 2019-04-09 00:25:01
This is a matter of opinion as you stated, and while I don't feel I understand the issue particularly well, I do have thoughts on it.
I think the answer is basically, because we don't need to yet and it's better safe than sorry.  The result to not change the blocksize is essentially the result of participants collectively agreeing not to do so.  BCH did precicely this, and at the present moment the free market is stating that they much prefer the 1 MB block version.
The downside to raising block size is a slight centralization effect, along with perhaps unforeseen glitches in the code or a non-smooth fork process.  These may seem to be small risks, but they are risks none-the-less.  There is also the school of thought that says "Since block size increases will never be a long-term solution, maybe it's better to just leave it as it is and force the issue of finding better solutions a big quicker."
Personally, I would rather keep the network as low-risk as possible and incentivise long-term solutions, than enjoy lower fees in the meanwhile.  Honestly, I don't think 12 cent transactions vs $2 transactions is the point.

The reply was already there when I originally read the article. The reply is bickering over the volume actually traded. It's irrelevant. Observe this hypothetical:
Clickbait journalist:   
"Climate change appears to have completely stopped:  
We scientists over here at GreatEnvironmentalReporting recently undertook a study to observe climate change. GER experts meticulously monitored the temperature over the course of eighteen (18) consecutive days. GER found that on 17 of the 18 days, the temperate at some point reached exactly 71 degrees Fahrenheit! It is in our opinion that the planet is therefore in an extremely stable state and climate change is no longer an issue."
Response:  
"Your article and conclusion is completely absurd. One, 18 days is a laughably insufficient sample to monitor climate patterns. Two, you should be comparing the temperature at similar times of the day to look for patterns, not wait for it to reach a certain temperature before recording it. Finally, our records show that during 3 of the days, it did not reach 71 degrees. So it would only be 15 out of 18 days anyways."
Clickbait journalist:  
"Thanks for your reply. Actually, we recorded the temperature using a hot-air balloon, so we were able to change altitudes to achieve our readings. This is why you probably got different results than us, and our original article stating 17 of 18 days was accurate!"

There's no address with a "bank" of BTC to be distributed to miners.  A transaction is created to distribute the mining reward to the miner's address, but there is no input address, only an output.  You can see one such transactions here, from one of the first blocks mined:
This is the only time the inputs wont equal the ouputs+fees, when newly generating coins as a reward.

That would make sense.  I know Coinbase will let you purchase immediately, but they have to make sure the payment clears before they can let you withdraw the coins.

This is a legitimate question, and one I see all the time.  Usually it's not in the form of a question, but rather from people (incorrectly) stating that it's possible and simple for billionaires to actually do this.
**The short answer is, because it wouldn't work and they would actually lose money.**
The longer answer requires understanding how markets and order books work, and what it actually means when we say the price moves.  The price is simply the most recent trade that was made.  If a whale single-handedly buys enough BTC to spike the price from $5000 to $6000, then what was the most recent trade that was made?  And who do you supposed was the buyer in that trade?
You guessed it, Mr. Billionaire was.  He bought BTC for $6000.  But wait!  I thought the price was $5000.  So did he buy at $5000 or $6000?  Well the answer is, both.  And everything in between.  He paid 5000 for some, 5020 for some more, 5050... 5100... 5200... 5417... 5580.. 5999... all the way to 6000.  He bought all the BTC being offered by everyone who wanted to sell at any price between 5000 and 6000.  So in reality, his average price paid was more like $5500 per BTC.
Okay, but the price is now $6000 and he only paid $5500.  Maybe he doesn't profit the full $1000 different, but at least he gets to pocket the $500 difference, right?  Again, wrong.  If he wants to now sell his newly acquired BTC, he has to go through the same process but in the opposite direction.  The first ones he sell might be for 5999, but he has to keep hunting for buyers at lower and lower prices until he unloads his final BTC back at 5000.  Again his average price might be around $5500.
So perhaps he roughly breaks even?  Well, now we must consider trading fees paid to the exchange.  Because he's the market "taker" (the one accepting current offers rather than "making" an offer and waiting for someone else to "take" it), he will certainly be paying some fees.  Once when he buys all those coins, and again when he sells.  **So now he's actually down money due to fees.**
And it gets worse.  Remember the second part where I said he gets to sell all the way from 6000 back to 5000 for an average price of around 5500?  Well, this isn't even likely possible for Mr. "Quickly Becoming Idiotic" Billionaire.  Think about what happens to the market when he bought all the coins from 5000 to 6000.  Before he began his buying shenanigans, the price was $5000, meaning nobody was willing to pay even 5001 for a btc.  Rather, all the "bids" were for 4999, 4950, 4800, and lower.  So the moment he spikes the price up to 6000, **he creates a massive gap in the order book.**  There are still lots of people who want to buy at various prices under 5000, and lots who want to buy at prices over 6000.  But by wiping out the order books for that price range, he destabilizes the market to a point where nobody is quite certain what the price should be.
This is also why sudden, massive price spikes are often followed by huge swings of drops and rises just minutes or even seconds later.  That gap created by the massive buy order means it takes very little money to move the price up or down within that price range, since all the offers are gone.  Slowly, people start posting their bids and asks within that range, and the order book rebuilds and the market stabilizes (usually somewhere in the middle of the gap he created).
So in reality, after his purchase, the market might swing up and down between 5000 and 6000, and eventually stabilize at, say, 5600.  Mr. "Beginning to Sweat" Billionaire waits for the liquidity to build back up, and executes his glorious dump of coins, selling from 5600 down to 4600, for an average sale price of $5100.
So in the end, he actually bought for about $5500 (plus fees), and sold for $5100 (minus fees).  Does that sound like a profitable strategy?
**Some advice to billionaires out there reading this: Probably don't attempt this.**
(It's also worth noting, that if you attempted this with $100 worth instead of $millions, you would basically buy at a price of $5000 (plus fees) and sell at a price of $5000 (minus fees).  This is far better than the outcome of Mr. "Potentially No Longer A" Billionare's trade.  He lost a ton of money due to wiping out the order book (known as "slippage") because he was trading with so much capital.  A smaller trader won't experience so much, if any, slippage.  So ironically, not only does the strategy you outlined not actually work for billionaires, but it's actually MORE difficult for whales to maneuver in the market than it is for small players, due to the slippage they encounter by moving the market).

Great question!  I am often surprised how few people understand the mechanisms of mining, even though who have been active in the space for years.
You may already understand this, but "solving a cryptographic puzzle" is actually nothing more than a completely random guess-and-check process.  Mining rigs are simply powerful, specialized computers that repeatedly throw a random string of numbers/letters (the input) into an algorithm (SHA-256).  The algorithm performs many steps of changes, and then spits out a completely different string (the output).  If the output is a loser, which they usually are, the computer immediately tries another random string.  If the output is a "winner", the miner yells "BINGO!" to the network.  Every other miner checks his "bingo card" and if it checks out, they all accept it as a winner, pile his winning card onto the whole stack of previous winners (the blockchain), award him his prize (mining reward+fees) and start the whole process over again.
Mining is the "consensus mechanism" for the bitcoin Network (there are other possible mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Stake that operate a bit differently, but Bitcoin doesn't use those).  In other words, mining is "the way by which everyone agrees".  Remember that blockchain is a type of "distributed ledger."  That means every participant must have the same exact copy of the blockchain.  The mining process is what ensures this.  Because every participant has the same copy of the ledger, they can be certain whether a Bitcoin transaction is valid or counterfeit.  Any counterfeiting attempts are immediately identified and discarded, since there is no question as to what the correct blockchain is and every coin can be traced back to its source.
So in that sense, the "fully agreed upon blockchain copy" is what prevents counterfeiting.  And where did that copy come from?  It came from everyone.  No one person, government, corporation can "update" the blockchain how they see fit.  The only ones who can "update" the blockchain is the most recent miner who "wins" the next block.
So couldn't a rogue miner who "wins" a block simply update the blockchain to say "Oh hey look this super rich address just sent me 10,000 BTC!"  In fact they could, but because they don't have the private keys to the super rich address, there isn't a valid transaction hash that says "10,000 BTC from rich address to rogue miner".  When he yells "BINGO!" and tries to pile his card on top, the other miners will say "Well you do in fact have a winning bingo card, but you included an invalid transaction with it!  Therefore it is no longer valid".  Every single other miner in the world will notice this invalid transaction, and will want nothing to do with that block.  Otherwise they will end up trying to earn block rewards on an "orphaned" chain, earning BTC that no one will accept and are worthless.
So then the final piece is... what is actually secure about all this?  Well, mining blocks is extremely difficult.  The hardware is expensive, the electricity is expensive.  Because miners collectively control the network, it's important that this power is spread around.  This is why we say Bitcoin is decentralized.  If one entity controlled 51% or more of the mining power, they could potentially perform an attack on the network.  So if it's extremely expensive and difficult to obtain 51% of the hashpower, that fact prevents some body (such as a government) from shutting it down even if they wanted to.

Alright, but you said that originally you "sent bitcoins to bitcoin core".  Where did those bitcoins come from to begin with?
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:10:36
It should list your addresses somewhere in core.  Or alternatively, where did you send the bitcoins from?  Perhaps that exchange/wallet/whatever shows a receipt of "xxx amount of BTC sent to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ address"

I saw the article.  Read what I originally wrote in this thread.  One journalist just kinda threw out his claim with no evidence, and everyone latched onto his baseless theory.

[electrum.org]( is a great one.
They are called light-client wallets, because they connect to a 3rd-party "node" in order to verify if transactions are valid, rather than referencing a downloaded blockchain.  It is *slightly* less secure than a full-client, but light-clients like this a considered a good option for most users.

I agree!  But it's meant to be non-intimidating :)

I think this is a very realistic answer.
We see the response to crisis situations in individual countries (venezuela, cyprus) where people get excited about a financial hedge, and buy in.  But the buyers aren't actually involved in the crisis.  People *personally* getting hit by financial crises causes them to scramble to stay afloat.  They will liquidate non-essential assets.  People stop speculating.  Bagholders may dump at a loss because they need to make mortgage payments and cover bills.  Certainly many holders will still be financially sound and continue holding, but fewer speculators and more people forced to cash out means supply up / demand down.
Unless you think the people or institutions with large amounts of capital will respond the way they do with gold.  I'm betting those funds/endowments that have survived for generations aren't on board with crypto's lasting power yet.  It's only been around 10 years.  Maybe in the future it will hedge against housing and stock markets, but my guess is we aren't anywhere near that yet.

I just estimated it by saying there's a 1/600 chance of finding a block in any given second.  The odds of finding a block in a specific second (distance from a set moment) are just 1/600 multiplied by the chances you haven't found a block in the preceding seconds.  It's trivial to "simulate" this in excel.  I got 0.04881, so I assume your formula is correct.

Valid.  I guess I'd ask why you would think a blanket statement like "shorting is idiotic" is a good idea?

You are welcome!  I had been reading and researching a lot more the past week for obvious reasons, and seeing again so much misinformation reminded me that teaching others is often a great way to refresh and even further your own knowledge.

That's not how any of this.... works at... all...... what....... you are going to make me throw up.  Please tell me you were being facetious.
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:11:37
That is a highly speculative and unfounded claim.  Obviously all exchanges are going to see a massive spike in volume during a big price movement.  To say "well it must have been one single actor since the volume spikes were synchronized across three major exchanges" is hilariously obtuse.  It is much more likely this was driven by the derivatives on bitmex getting short squeezed (probably by bitmex themselves as they are transparent about their trading wing).

The only thing more fascinating than the way the price moves in the same repetitive cycles, is the way people's emotions and rationalizations cycle through the same repetitive patterns. Time after time. After time. After time.
To be clear, I consider myself wrapped up in these emotions as well. Being aware of the patterns can help one break free of them, but there's a required step between the recognition and the actual breaking-free which is necessary. Having gone through all this probably about a dozen times now, it helps to relax some, but it's like saying your 3rd breakup is easier than your first.  It's true, but it's still gonna sting for a while, just maybe not as long and as intensely.
The emotional cycles are things like this post, where people are experiencing real losses, but "zoom out it doesn't matter". Or the hype cycles where it's never going to slow down or pull back because "this time it's different". Or when things are totally getting crushed and it's "lol, this is complete garbage, what were we thinking this is the future?". Even more mundane stuff like "hey look the price has been very stable for 3 months, looks like volatility is finally subsiding and adoption will ramp up as a result," followed every single time by extremely volatile moves in both directions.
Nobody ever sees the emotions coming until they arrive. People will say stuff at peaks like "Well I don't care if the price goes down, because I'll still have the same amount of BTC, so why should I sell?" Then it tanks, and they go "What was I thinking? I'm in this for purchasing power, and this is too unstable, I'll take the loss here. If it goes up, it's no loss to me since I'm out". Then it surges up and they go "What was I thinking? I believe in this project. I never should have sold, but now that I did, I'll just rebuy here. Sure it's for less BTC, but that's okay, at least I'll have a piece of it now. And if it goes down in price, that's fine because I'll still have the same amount of BTC." Rinse, repeat.
As well, pretty much all the significant moves relative to any time-scale have been a surprise to most people. "It won't rise faster than xxx, so I have plenty of time to get in" - it rises way faster than expected. "It can't go lower than xxx" - cue it going lower than xxx. Time after time everyone is surprised that the price breaks out upwards and downwards of expected constraints and levels. And yet, people don't start thinking "Hey maybe I should kind of expect the unexpected and plan accordingly". Instead it's just pure disbelief and shock every volatile move like they never could have seen it coming.
I dunno. This is no shocking revaluation about human behavior. We are driven by emotions far more than we like to admit, not unlike other species. It's just always interesting to see it play out in these markets where controlling your emotions would be insanely beneficial to us. But the vast majority of us simply are helpless participants on our emotional roller coasters, learning shockingly little each lap around the track, if anything at all.

Not touching it is obviously fine. It's far better to do nothing, than stress out and potentially lose money if you aren't suited for such decisions.
If you want to get involved, then two things.  Firstly, consider anything money you use to buy as immediately gone. If you have $10,000 saved and are thinking you'd like to buy 0.1 BTC for $800, think of it like buying a vacation or new toy. Can you afford the $800 hit? If so, well then great. So you buy it, store it in your wallet. Congrats, now you have $9200. That other $800 is gone forever. If that idea (blowing $800 right now) doesn't sound appealing, then pick a lower amount, or none at all. When you spend $800 on a vacation, you (hopefully) don't stress heavily about the value of your vacation going down as your weekend getaway gets underway. If you buy BTC, you also should not stress about the price because you already lost all that money anyways when you purchased it.
Secondly, as you said you need to find a way to insulate yourself from your emotions. One good way is to make a very ***specific and clear*** strategy for what you intend to do with your little digital toy you're about to buy. "If it ever makes it that far, I will sell 20% at 50k, 30% at 100k, and the remaining I will hold until it can buy me a house." Or whatever.  Then you have nothing else to ever decide or stress about.
If instead you want to play the future decisions by ear, well you're probably going to fuck it up royally and be upset about it. But if you do go this route, then I'd at least advise you to do your best to anticipate all your emotions and perspective changes ***before*** they occur. If it drops 70% in a day, how would that make you feel? How would it change your opinion of the BTC project? If it 10x's in a 5 month span, does that change the expected trajectory of things? Will you be willing to sell while it's seemingly rising every single day? How will you feel if it triples again after you sell? Will you be tempted to repurchase at the higher price? Would that be a good decision? Why or why not?
One of the clearest examples of people failing to do this is when planning to buy at a much lower price in the future. It was trading at 20k, and many dreamed of buying at 10k, 5k, 3k, 1k, or whatever. But they didn't have any plan or anticipate the event and their emotions before it occurred. They imagined buying a 20k BTC for 3k. But that's never going to occur. You're buying a 3k BTC for 3k. What will the sentiment actually feel like to you if it drops from 20k to 3k? How did it feel when it went from 1100 to 200? How did the DOW feel when it went from 14k to 7k in a year? Why will everyone be selling? Are you willing to go against that trend? How will you feel if it drops another 50% from your buy price? What if it comes close but just misses your target?
If you can anticipate many of the specific potential outcomes, both good and bad, and create your responses ahead of time, it's far easier to make decisions on good logic rather than raw emotions. It doesn't necessarily mean you won't completely abandon your logic when the time comes, nor that your logic will end up being correct. But you're giving yourself a better chance of behaving rationally when everyone else is acting emotionally, and that tends to have a much stronger track record.

It's fairly irresponsible of you to state this at fact to someone who made it clear they are inexperienced with any of this stuff. Nobody knows this is going to happen.

To be honest, I think it's unlikely to be a safe-haven asset. Such a thing hardly exists at all, and the things that kind of are tend to be very conservative assets with poor overall returns. Gold or guns/seeds and such. Even gold usually takes a big hit for the first 6-12 months following a recession.
I don't think it's some perfect asset that's going to take over. It's not magic, but it does a lot of things well enough to possibly have a place. Most people seem so divisive on it either becoming either completely obsolete, or taking over all currencies and financial assets. The reality is people will probably never decide, and it will exist in the middle. I think its role is to give a bit of control back to individuals and keep central banks in check. The idea of it taking over completely is rather anarchist and extreme, anyways. It probably wouldn't be a good thing.

There is no question that there is optimism about Bitcoin's ability to act as a hedge. So whenever there are isolated events like Cyprus, it ignites that optimism. But as the author points out, there hasn't been an actual global recession in Bitcoin's existence.
The hangup in the hypothesis is that Bitcoin is such a speculative asset, and speculation goes way, way down in recessions. It's possible that instead of fleeing into Bitcoin as a safe-haven, investors will simply default to seemingly safer options like bonds or gold.
It's almost a paradox to say we are "speculating it will be a safe-haven". The point is, there are good arguments for either side.

First of all, to be certain of something is merely a state of mind. It does not mean it is true. Secondly, you aren't even sure, I am quite confident in that. Would you (hypothetically of course) put every single asset to your name on the line vs my $1 that it will hit 100k? No, because there is always uncertainty. Some people don't understand this and hence it is irresponsible to state it.
