Good way to misinform people. Show them blonde holding a strange coin.

It is all about the possibilities - of course you can't say you know anything with 100% possibility. Roulette has determined outcomes with known possibilities - it is solved. BTC is not.
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:16:06
you say it like it is a bad thing
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:41:25

You need one crucial thing in every currency to be useful as a global currency. You should be able to predict (with very high probability) how the prices will move in the future (trend). When you have high volatility it is good only for speculation purposes. Also, the deflationary global currency is bad for the economy and will never happen. Great for storing of value tho.

One advice that is going to be really hard to follow. DO NOT LOOK AT THE PRICE. Let the mass media news tell you the price, you sell then.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:29:08
Who cares how much $ is worth. Care about how many people are using it on a daily basis, that is the end goal of crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:51:16
I first knew it existed when it was 17$ - bought my first when it was 44$. If it stayed in 40-100 range I would probably still try to convince people how cool it is.

The best idea ever. The only problem is there is no way of knowing where the points you mention are.

There is 0 correlation to BTC here.

What you describe is gambling. Research the topics and get your own answers. Reddit is not the place for that.

**Probably Mr Chao noticed the correlation between Bitcoin and altcoins or should I say, the absence of correlation at all?** 
\- there is a big correlation
**I know it happened in the past a few times but altcoins have always risen faster than bitcoin. Always!**
\- not true at all
**It's really hard to push Bitcoin up because of its capitalization. What do you think?** 
\- price does not matter for usability of BTC, only how volatile it is - that is true for any currency
**Altcoins are dead?**
\- no
**Bitcoin is going to the moon without alts?**
\- no

BTC is already here for 10 years, you can use it - what are you waiting for? 1 BTC = 1 BTC, it wont become chicken. Or are you here for the lambo?
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:14:40
Why would I lock money into BTC, it does not create any cash flow for me. All I can hope for is someone will buy it from me for a higher price sometimes in the future - which might be totally acceptable for some people.
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:24:14
It will burst soon, no doubt about it
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:42:27
When price falls it means there is more selling than buying. More dipping, more selling.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:55:53
So you basically need people who are willing to work for free?

Would never work in today's economy. Besides why would you need deflationary currency? You can invest and get good return, why would it be good for economy if people would just hoard (HODL) useless $ and not invest it in something?

You also make some price predictions by saying buy the dip. I sense fear in your post.
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:52:09
The real question is, are you?
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:36:31
Bitcoin doesn't care.

All I was saying is BTC can be banned and also we can all agree that banning it around the globe would decrease its usage - prices of drugs went up because of high risks of handling with them (supply), BTC is easy to use even if it is banned so I see no reason why prices would jump in case of a global ban.
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:37:13

Tell me one reason why you can not make BTC illegal? You can make anything illegal, the bigger problem lies in law enforcement. 
BTC does NOT "just exist" - there is a network that keeps it alive (shared public ledger). There is NO BTC on Mars (Math is universal and can't be even compared to BTC).

Which does not make it a good asset to avoid inflation.
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:45:15
No, because it makes total sense once you dedicate some time in macroeconomy. Deflationary currency would collapse global economy
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:28:02
