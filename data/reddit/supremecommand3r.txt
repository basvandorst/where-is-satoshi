Open your mind up you shill

I don't get why there aren't services that let you buy but hold your Bitcoin for 6 months. Surely as a hodler I wouldn't mind selling my usd easier through PayPal or credit card this way.

It does, because each pool is generating a unique block. So you connect to the ghash server and see what it's working on, then see if the found block was the same one

After thanking them, I got the following great reply. This is the first time I've seen a b2b business embrace Bitcoin. A mainstream one I didn't bother even asking because I highly doubted they would and here they are doing it on their own. I also ran into a nicotine liquid store first ignoring me then announcing bitpay out of the blue. I think we're at the tipping point of businesses asking us to use Bitcoin instead of us begging them to accept it which was stupid because they get most of the benefits, not us. And seeing B2B businesses doing it is exciting!
We removed minimum payments because they did not achieve the goals we waned.  In any case,  bitcoin actually costs us (the merchant) very little (about a penny per transaction regardless of the amount) .   This is compared to traditional providers like Visa/MC/Discover/Amex and then PayPal followed their pricing model.  For an example, PayPal (and most of the rest of the payment systems) charge thirty five cents per transaction plus 2.X% of the total bill depending on Amex or Visa/MC/Discover (Amex is the highest).   
 
So... this would mean we would lose money on a 0.39 payment (but we do not lose with bitcoin payments at any price).  Our main goal for offering bitcoin is to avoid the average 3% charge we pay.  We try to sell it (to you and other publishers) by a tiny 2% bonus, but I personally like that we promote free market concepts.

Vms with modern cpus are incredibly secure. Add Windows emet and you're pretty much solid. But if you make a product, they can target it before it gets installed. Also a hdd image could be there sitting ready to be injected.
