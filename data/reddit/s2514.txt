Isn't the problem how you get in in or out from cash? Aside from selling directly to other people how can you avoid that?

There was also that guy who was buying peoples gox bux for a reduced price...

They can if they back bitcoin by dollars lol. You could use bitcoin as a sort of "backend" for transactions and it would save quite a bit on money transfers yet companies could still charge fees even though it would cost them very little. As long as the governmant requires taxes to be paid in dollars they will be used as people don't want to go to jail.
Hell they could even just start their own "government approved" coin or just change the value of dollars to bitcoin as they see fit.
Also dollars are way better for in person transactions.

I would imagine the average bitcoin user would use plexiglass ;)

Read up on [gox history]( The reason we are in this mess in the first place is people got greedy and tried to profit off the inflated gox price when all signs pointed to getting out.

Well for one thing paying with your phone protects your credit card number from going through random terminals. Google also allows you to get a free card from them that lets can be used like a credit card but draws money from google play which basically has the same benefits.

Just read [the wiki article]( (specifically the trading incidents section)
After the problems with gox started people should have started bailing out by transferring their btc to other trading sites but instead they kept in gox in the hopes the problem would go away.
@_date: 2014-09-12 11:27:44
If your phone dies you can always just use a credit card.

Yeah I agree regardless of if you believe in Bitcoin or not that teacher was out of line. If you are against Bitcoin just pretend this was about the child's religion or political view and the teacher told him that his religion is false or that the politician he wrote about is a bad guy.

I got the impression that most of them are just joking...
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:24:27
I heard that 98% of bitcoins have traces of cocane on them...
@_date: 2014-07-24 10:17:34
Well I am not expert but doesn't that defeat the whole purpose? Don't you need a few confirms to protect against double spending?
@_date: 2014-09-12 11:22:24
Why are you not using a password manager such as KeePass?

[This article]( goes into detail about Gox.
Edit: I do remember seeing an arbitrage guide but you needed to have a Japanese bank account. I am looking for the link in my bookmarks but I can't seem to find it...
I was able to find [this]( though
@_date: 2014-08-31 03:02:08
Yeah wouldn't at least %51 have to agree? The only way I see that hapaning is if there is some flaw discovered in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-24 07:35:48
Since when was it instant? Fast yes, but instant?
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:21:33
Well it's almost imposable to remove GoxBux™ (at least if you are in the US) so in my opinion it's better to store them offline for long term storeage because you never know when an online storage will be hacked or if like gox it will become hard to convert back to USD (assuming you live in the us. If you are woried about someone getting your email password or whatever you could always just put it on a cd should be fine for 20+ years (in the computer industry we always love redundancy so you could also put it on 2 cd's or a cd and a flashdrive etc just in case) and a flash drive should last many years if you only write to it once (flash drives normally die because they have limited read cycles) if you are really worried about it you could reburn the data in 10 years or so but you should be fine.

While I know these roller coasters are not the best for the long term future of bitcoin I can't help but think about the $200+ profit per coin...
Also one thing I don't get is why people kept their money in gox for so long... I mean you could not pull money out as USD I get that but couldn't people withdraw as bitcoin and sell on other markets? Sure you would take a hit on the money but if you are invested in bitcoin for the long term you are holding out knowing it would go up so over a period of say 2 more years that $200 dollar loss would seem so small.

Nobody is praising them... What they did is wrong but she could have prevented it from ever happening by not putting the photos on the cloud.

Try importing the key into another wallet client?
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:31:55
I kind of hope it has another crash after the 31st so I can buy in again.
@_date: 2014-01-26 03:22:38
Because the kind of people who get into bitcoin are not the kind of people who have an old machine with a floppy drive lying around right?
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:44:40
This would explain why they crashed to around 100 and then went up again.
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:33:58
MtGox takes a long time to get coins from and their price is overinflated.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:07:12
Why not just store it on a flash drive or cd?
@_date: 2014-01-26 03:36:16
I remember hearing about bitcoin back at that time and thinking "I could make a lot of money with this if it ever takes off maybe I should mine it... Nah this will probably never take off."

Computers fields are one of the few places your boss would say "I see you are being very redundant today... Great job!"
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:40:11
Good luck getting the USD out of MtGox to bring to another site.
*unless you live in Japan or have Japanese bank accounts*
@_date: 2014-09-12 11:29:09
You also need the ccv and the expiration date as well as the accont holders full name.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:20:21
If that is true it would make much more sense to alow bitcoin but to regulate it so that it is only legal to buy and sell to "regestered wallets" that way they can track all our spending.

The worst thing about it is as ads are blocked companies get more creative/intrusive with their ads and the blocking has to get stronger.
I remember when youtube had an ad at the start of *some* vids *sometimes* but recently I have seen ads in the *middle* of vids.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:42:48
Maybe because I was trying to make a statement of demographic and was in not saying anything about the protocol lol.
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:40:25
Yeah but do all banks even have that feature? And of the ones that do don't you have to activate it?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:44:23
Pretty sure someone is doing a pump and dump on bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-08-31 03:08:36
Yeah that's the only way I see it changing and even then I don't think Btcoint would just disappear like that unless it was a very serious flaw. Whats more likely (if anything at all) is a superior coin being invented and becoming bigger than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:56:36
What is redundancy?
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:09:28
Why would it fade?
edit: you could also just email it to yourself if you have a secure enough password.
@_date: 2014-01-25 01:59:38
I never assumed you where. I was just providing you with information that is not merely anecdotal evidence. Sorry if it came off as me being hostile as this was not my intention at all.
@_date: 2014-09-12 11:26:06
I would think the average bitcoin user would use better security than the average iPhone user though.
@_date: 2014-07-24 11:10:41
You sell bitcoin on ebay? I heard that was risky buisness due to paypal... How do you get around that?
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:11:01
Just because you see stories on this sub of people loosing their coins doesn't automatically mean that the average bitcoin user doesn't have better security practices than the average iPhone user who doesn't use bitcoin...
@_date: 2016-09-07 19:49:48
A solution would be end to end encryption that has options for both.
You could go with a server for ease of use and then have a toggle for p2p, automatically fall back on p2p if it fails, or have it try p2p first then send to server for offline delivery.
Only tradeoff I see here is the loss of any features that require plaintext. For example, Google is working on the ai thing and that requires a server to process the plaintext.
@_date: 2016-09-07 23:44:04
Discovery can be done using the same method as torrents right? I forgot the name but there's a way of discovery based on who your peers have discovered.
@_date: 2016-09-07 22:23:38
Yes but it's not p2p is it?
@_date: 2016-09-07 22:22:41
Tox is great but unfortunately Antox is very slow to update and video chat doesn't work.
It also doesn't use a server (which is fine since it's made to replace skype.)
@_date: 2016-09-07 17:15:02
Because of the downsides. If your contact is offline the message will have to be re-sent later and you both have to be online at the same time for it to go out.
@_date: 2016-09-08 04:47:41
Yeah that's what I was thinking of. There is also probably a way to do it through phone numbers that I'm not thinking of...
@_date: 2016-09-07 17:13:33
From the sound of it they only want you using their services on their device.
@_date: 2015-04-16 07:31:39
Or the people running the software...
@_date: 2015-11-23 16:19:24
A lot of news sources are also talking about how encryption is bad because terrorists use it even though the attackers used unencrypted SMS. They are either incompetent, using click bait bullshit just for money, or they are using fear to push a political agenda.
Honestly I hope it's the first one, I'd like to believe that these media sources just suck at their jobs rather than them intentionally spreading misinformation but I doubt that's it.

There are these scammers in India that call up my grandma and tell her her windows computer has a virus and try to get her to give them remote access to fix it. Thing is, I switched my grandma to linux. She was always having trouble with Windows and her computer was old so I just put ubuntu on an old laptop and gave it to her.
Since then I hardly get calls for help regarding her computer because it's so simple for her but one time she fell for that tech scam and I was laughing my ass off imagining them giving her instructions for Windows and getting frustrated because nothings working like it should.

This is literally the only reason I still use it. I use version 2.2 though.
Edit: on second though it's also because that version is in my private trackers whitelist.
