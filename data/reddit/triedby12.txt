Anyone endorsing an investment that they put money in abuses their position.

....was a currency

U have no idea what you are talking about, do you?
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:47:24
okay, the redditors on r/bitcoin

I'm not arguing, but it sounds to me that that general bitcoiners have changed their opinion about it being a currency.

Is it safe?......could someone explain this to me (Is that statement saying bitcoing is safe?). Sure from the stand point of a common thief (right now) it is pretty safe, but lots of people have lost bitcoin from other factors.

Ya thanks. What I find interesting is how everyone's opinion of bitcoin as a currency changed after the fact that economists and the likes place bitcoin on a boundary between currency, commodity and financial asset. At first the followers and believers termed bitcoin as a currency. Now it seems they have just given into the system that they wanted out of.

Thanks for clearing that up. So bitcoin is no longer a digital currency?

"Bitcoin is safe, simple, cheap, and most importantly, secure."
For members of circlejerk sure.

Why are you betting that bitcoin will outperform a stock? I thought bitcoin is suppose to be a currency. The simple fact that you are suggesting a currency will outperform a stock, suggests that you are implying that bitcoin is not a currency but a share that can be easily converted to a currency of your choice.

This would be like stating, high school students know about Bieber. It's more common for high schoolers to know about Bitcoin than it is for grandparents. Just saying....

It's called the stock market dumb dumb!!!

This is why crypto does not appeal to the masses.

Ford was a racist and you are using a quote comparing bitcoin to aboriginals.
