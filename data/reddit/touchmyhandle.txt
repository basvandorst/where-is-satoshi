Have the 24 word seed stored in 2 places accessible to your wife. Preferably on a crypto steel. To protect your seed set a passphrase of at least 4 words. Store these 4 words nowhere physical. You and your wife memories them, and then ask another 1 or 2 trusted people to memorize those words too. Only you should be using the PIN (I hope its 9 digits). Having your wife memorise the pin risks her forgetting the passphrase (minimum 4 words). She can always access the coins using the passphrase and the seed in worst case scenario.

There are very few fake 50 pound notes. I've seen a couple, but generally forgers avoid them because they're scrutinised so much. They're actually accepted all over the place in reality. For fear of them removing the old notes (I know they're still spendable, but it could create friction) I spent literally the last 18 months only carrying round 50s, and anyone who knows how to check for fakes is normally more than happy to accept them. The new ones will be way better because they're so much harder to fake.

How easy is multi-sig with a trezor? Just 2 of 2. What wallet options are there to pair with trezor?
@_date: 2018-09-25 14:44:04
Sounds pretty secure to me, although I'm not a total expert. Realistically who is going to find it? Some random guy finding it is unlikely to be able to guess that it's even a seed, let alone 12 of a 24 word seed. 
Buy a trezor and use multi-sig with electrum. That way you have a 24 word seed from the trezor and a 12-13 word seed from electrum . Keep the 24 word seed with you at home on a piece of steel, with another backup copy at a friends house. Then find a secure place for 2 copies of the electrum seed. 
You can even put some decoy Bitcoin on the original trezor seed to make it look like that's all you have, when in reality your stash needs the electrum seed too. You can even add a paraphrase on top, but be careful, your greatest risk is probably losing access through some accidental loss of one of the seeds. This is why I memorize all my seeds, it's surprisingly easy. I have an atrocious memory but breaking it down into chunks of three words and learning them one at a time takes literally a couple of hours.

Approximately 2000 times easier than breaking a 12 word seed. (Since there are about 2000 words to choose from). So still pretty impossible. 
I think you mean seed right? A paraphrase is an additional layer of entropy applied on top of the seed which can be any numbers, letters or symbols of any length I believe.

Look, my portfolio is agreeing with you. For the first time in a year i have less than 1% of my stash on exchange, BUT the liquidity on the orderbooks tells me that if just 45k bitcoin were dumped then the price would drop 10%, and 45k coins is just 0.26% of the supposed supply. 
Interestingly, and talking myself out of what I said, that 45k btc to -10% is double what it was the last time I checked, and an increase in the thickness of the orderbooks was one of the signals I was watching for to predict the next bull run. Its god to play devils advocate though.
Edit: Actually scratch that, I was only using USD. When using all currencies the max it will show me is 37k btc taking us to -4%. Which is an insane increase in the strength of the orderbooks. MOON!

I always consider myself as having a poor memory, but I've managed to remember my last three seeds. The last of which is 24 words plus another four random words as a paraphrase. I assure you you can 100% do it with an hours effort. Split it into 3 x 8 and just focus on learning the first 3 words. Once you have those down try and nail the forst 6 words. Keep going and you will be shocked how easy it is. There's a guy who holds all sorts of memory records who just trained himself. Said he never smhad any remarkable memory at all before he trained. Obviously keep a physical backup too. Best bet is keep the seed with someone and share the paraphrase with two other people but have then NEVER write it down.

It's a custodial wallet, so you don't open any channels. As much as we all might sniggger at custodial wallets, this is without a doubt going to be the most popular form of using Bitcoin for new users. If some big exchange implements custodial LN wallets linked with a sidechain like liquid to some big payment processor, almost all the issues with Bitcoin are solved IMO. Not everyone is like me and you. People don't care about custody when it comes to a few cents.

Easy. Dont over complicate things. More people lose access to coins than get hacked or robbed.
Set a strong passphase on your wallet. Record the seed in 2 places your wife can only access in case of your death. Tell her the pass phrase and make her remember it. You also memorize the pass phrase and tell a third reliable person who has no access to the seed.

It's not RBF. Basically if you didn't send your full balance the first tx you would have received a change output back to your own wallet. That change output in your wallet would have been unconfirmed too, as it's part of the tx. This means you can send the unconfirmed change back to yourself and up the fee on that. Miners see both transactions as one, so if they want to grab the second high fee tx they have to grab the first one at the same time. It's called child pays for parent.

Unfortunately fidor only offer personal accounts in the jurisdiction I want to operate in. I assume Solaris is just a SEPA connected bank too (I need to be connected to faster payments network in the UK). Get a thorough business plan written out with all your corporate documents and policies and get your bank account locked down. Preferably open two accounts. Banking has been the issue for so many Bitcoin companies. 
It's a good idea. The micro transaction market is heavily under served. You could charge a very reasonable premium for a 10-20 euro transaction. Ideally you would want it to be nationwide though, so you can market it to all Germans. 10k could be enough to launch and use as your float provided you don't have any other costs to reach market.

Miners can create a block template before they even find a solution. Even if they don't, it's a split second process that in comparison to the hashing part is totally insignificant. Technically you're right that in the split second that takes someone else could find and propagate a block quicker, but if that would happen in 1 in a 1000 cases (it might happen more like 1 in 100,000) then it's not economical to throw away ~0.15btc repeatedly.

One of the main points of OTC trades is so that it doenst influence the market. Doing a deal directly off an exchange with someone means it won't hit the orderbook. To publicise the OTC deals would have a  similar effect. If people knew that coins were being traded behind the scenes itbwould probably influence the price at least a little (like when huge amounts of coins start moving). So I think it's extremely unlikely that anyone offering OTC trades will allow them to be tracked. 
It's also very logical that someone wanting to do an OTC trade will pay a premium to do so. If you wanted to buy $10m in btc right now, even if you split it up on several exchanges you have 2 options. You can do a market order and buy it all in one go, in which case you will experience slippage, ie the first coin you buy will be at market rate, but by the time your order has eaten into the sell walls the very last Bitcoin you buy might end up costing you 2% more. Average out the cost and you've paid more than the market rate was at the time you decided to buy. Second option is to buy slowly, but (I'm speculating here)  people's bots can detect suttle events like this and start buying up themselves, cause the same issue. For these reasons people are very happy to pay say a 0.5% fee to buy a huge block of Bitcoin at one price. I would imagine that some of them probably buy on exchange immediately after doing OTC trades too (speculation). Nowadays a million dollars on exchange will barely move the price though.
You also avoid the counterparty risk of having coins in a custodial wallet on an exchange which is obviously very appealing. I imagine new accounts wiring in 10 million dollars, buying Bitcoin and then immediately withdrawing it are susceptible to being frozen and questioned more about the source of the funds etc.

I use bitstamp. Check my comment history, I'm always bigging them up. As for the tether debacle, I'm yet to see any evidence. Looks like an opportunity for the bold to make money. This is not even the lowest it's been in the last 18 months. Looks like the people in the know are already buying it up, while people who buy anything are screaming that tether is going to burn. 
You also didn't understand my precious comment, but luckily you are so sad you came 16 days back through your comment history to show how noob you are so I can explain it again. If tether fails, exchanges like kraken already confirmed that it's just an asset like any other. Trader take the risk by owning it, not the exchanges.

It's not calculated by percentage. Potentially sending a million dollars would cost the same as sending 5 dollars. It depends on how many transactions created your total balance. If you received 2btc in one transactions that's the cheapest. If you received 2btc in 100 transactions that's going to cost a hell of a lot more because the transaction is bigger. 
On trezor web wallet when you go to send it will tell you how much the fee is. I suggest just trying the lowest priority fee possible, or even a custom fee of 1 satoshi per byte. It might take a while to confirm, but if you're in no rush it doenst matter. Potentially you could do it for cents.

If you genuinely plan to try and scale this and make it into a business I suggest you start with banking. Restocking coins for cash can be done with p2p advertising on localbitcoins, but its not a consistent flow of btc and eventually you will always need bank transfer. Finding a bank is almost impossible if they know what you're doing. I say this after working for a company some years ago that raised over 10 million euros and had to shut down because we couldn't get banking. Just in the last month I'm working with a new start up, and we just managed to secure a bank account through a stroke of luck really.
What is your budget for starting the business, and how much collateral do you have for inventory (btc)?

Nobody can force a miner to include transactions in their blocks. Nobody can even force them to claim the 12.5btc if they're crazy enough not to claim it. 
It would stand to reason that the economic incentive from collecting all the fees would make them include transactions... but they aren't... So people are speculating that they are doing it to drive up transaction fees on Bitcoin to make BCH look better. Maybe this is true, maybe it's not. From what I understand, not all the miners In antpool belong to them, lots are individuals who just connect to their pool. Which means they are earning these miners less Bitcoins. Which should be something that really pisses of these miners.

I dont think this is a permanent policy though.

No offence buddy, but I've been trading on LB since 2012 across 3 countries. I know the scene inside out better than you ever could.

I would say no. You can cryptographically verify the ISO befoer you burn, but there are too many moving pieces inside an OS to compile and check yourself. Buy a trezor and use a passphrase (Sometimes called a 13th/25th word) and you have a pretty secure setup. You can use your trezor through electrum if you like, but your keys stay protected. Or go one step further and do multisig with electrum and trezor.

It's not an opinion, it's a black and white fact. You have to break an additional cryptographic function to steal funds from an address that hasn't been spent from. Even when an address has been spent from it's almost completely safe from attack, but it doesn't change the FACT that it reduces security. FACT.

Your computer cant steal the pin. Your trezor displays the numbers on a 3x3 grid and you enter the pin using the mouse on a blank 3x3 grid on the screen. Ofcourse the trezor is encrypted, but use a passphrase for an extra layer of encryption. I dont understand how you can be concerned about security yet still want a wallet.dat? That makes no sense at all. Store the 24 words digitally if you must bit that's just adding an attack vector. With a passphrase set up your trezor is basically unhackable.

LN tx require an on chain transaction first, THEN they become an broadcast tx. As my comment stated, you cant securely store this unbroadcast transaction. I do think we should let fees rise to a point where SW adoption hits 90%+ though. Then we can hard fork it in and maybe discuss a test block size increase of 1.1mb or 1.2mb and see what we learn from that.
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:26:53
Yes but when most individuals are priced out of using bitcoin, they wont run nodes anymore. I agree about fees paying miners after block subsidy is gone, we need blocks to be full by this time to create a fee market, but this is a long way off. We really should be looking at a very small (0.1mb or 0.2mb) increase once we have close to 100% SW adoption and schnorr.

I'm nit totally sold on LN. Funds are not protected by your mnemonic seed. So for people making micro tx this is just not appropriate.

Once we see ~100% segwit adoption, we should hard fork it in with a BIP to raise the base block size to 1.1 or 1.2mb. Something so low that there would be little reason to fork away, but also large enough of an increase that we can see how it affects node count.

It's more a criticism that LN isnt going to help with congestion. 32mb blocks is ridiculous and in a few more block halvings when bcash is still not even filling 1mb blocks they're going to realise that unless the price of bcash has gone up magnitudes they wont be able to pay miners. As for bitcoin, we probably couldn't even fill 32mb blocks in that time either, but it's not like tx are increasing ridiculously. It took 10 years to reliably fill 1mb blocks, so even if a small increase of just 0.2mb would give us some breathing space to let LN grow. The notion that hard forks are too dangerous is preposterous. BTC is still bitcoin, and I'm a maximalist, but we're treading dangerous ground refusing to increase blocksize or do hard forks.

You're severely underestimating my knowledge of Bitcoin. BCH is a centralised pump.and dump coin. I can totally understand why people would choose BCH but it's pretty naive. In 14 years time (not long at all) the clock reward will be 0.78bch, you'll realise why empty blocks is an issue. Not withstanding how bch development is totally centralised. Hard forks every 6 months? This is not how you make immutable money. BCH has an absolute right to exist, but to pretend that it's even in the same realms of Bitcoin is pretty silly. I would support a fork of bitcoin before moving to BCH. BCH is not bitcoin.

I agree. People are also scared about the safety of a HF blocksize increase, and how hard it would be to gain consensus. In my opinion once we see 75%-95% SW adoption we should raise a proposal to HF in a 0.1mb block size increase. Maybe even a 0.05mb increase. Something so small that few people could object to it. An opportunity to test the safety of a hard fork increase without the risk of splitting the chain (would someone really fork off over such a small increase?). Give it years to gain support if necessary.

Its very possible that there's a really fast and convenient way to do this all automatically, possibly using a tool like Ian Coleman's (OFFLINE ofcourse). However I did this a long time ago (way before the forks) and this is what I did to get my Bitcoin out. Obviously get all the Bitcoin out before starting with any forks.
If theres no maintained version, I would find an old version (possibly the one you already may have) and run it offline. You can import your wallet offline and view all private keys in your wallet in one big text list. If you made a lot of transactions this may be a laborious way to do it because you will have tons of addresses all with little bits of coin in, some empty, but you can import each address into a mobile wallet like mycelium or whatever. I don't remember if armoury supported converting all the list of.keys to convenient qr codes for sweeping into mycelium mobile, but if it doenst, please God don't use an online qr code converter. Do the whole thing with your laptop offline and don't connect your laptop again until you've swept all your keys.

This is how professionally run machines would be operated, otherwise the operator is taking a net long or short position in the market. The ATM can be connected via API to an exchange account stocked with USD and BTC to rebuy or sell as customers buy or sell. There's nothing saying you have to operate an ATM like this, but its the only way to make a guaranteed profit. E.g. it's no point buying at -5% and selling at -5% (a 10% margin) if the price moves more than 10% against you in either direction. Basically you want a machine to hedge all trades done at the ATM so you make money no matter what.

Don't panic. If you have the 25 words, I don't see any possible reason it cant be replicated to get the private key. Electrum got the entropy to create the address from the 25 words, and it almost certainly didn't give you a public key that it didn't have the private key to.
In my opinion your greatest risk now is getting ripped off by someone purporting to help you. Whatever you do make sure you're careful not to run any script or program you don't understand. I'm pretty confident when everyone wakes up there will be some Mr robot who can help you. Just make sure you get the advice in public and it doenst involve any untrusted software. I would guess it would be a different derivation path or something simple. Seriously don't panic, it's not like you don't have the seed backed up.

At a guess, maybe they wait 3 blocks (or more) before processing any withdrawals from the account. This still leaves someone the ability to make some fraudulent trades on the platform, but not to withdraw. Also there might be rules like deposits of 10 btc+ for example have to wait for more confirms. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:22:50
Yes it's an issue, but provided they require 3 confirmations on the deposit before processing any withdrawals then the fraudster wouldn't be able to use a 51% attack to gain Bitcoins. (I don't know if bitmex has this policy). I would also hoep they had a policy that on large deposits capable of actually moving the market they would require more confirms. Orphan rate is very low tha ks to small blocks, so a big pool would have to be complicit and this would be way more damaging to Bitcoin than someone performing crazy trades. That pool would also probably be criminally liable too, so it's unlikely IMO.

I would make a specific point to clarify your argument. What you're basically saying is that without users to buy and sell the coin and provide liquidity on exchanges the price on the new chain falls to zero. Connecting to a full node is the only way to enforce which chain you interact on, ie full nodes can never be described as powerless. Not to mention it's another copy of the blockchain, a basic fact glossed over by some people.

I'm not totally against raising the blocksize a little in principle, but we need to explore 2nd layer transactions ASAP. Either way BCH developers have been extremely reckless raising the blocksize to 32mb. What happens in 14 years when the block reward is 0.78 bch? If they only fill 20mb on average at one cent per transaction they are screwed. Who is going to pay the miners?

Bitcoin already implemented a minimum relay fee, didn't it? Nodes will reject 0 fee transactions? I think there is no logic to say that blocks will definitely be full, even if they accepted 0 fee transactions. Even if this was true, what reason will miners have to secure the network if they aren't being paid transaction fees. I'm making the case that a fee market is necessary.

And  not one of their banks knows that they are dealing with Bitcoin. They simply play whack a mole with their bank accounts swapping from bank to bank and opening new companies.

Were running pretty comfortably at 1mb blocks 10 years in. If we went to say 8mb and those blocks dont fill up by the time block rewards drop very low then we're in trouble. We need full blocks to create a fee market. Dont forget that in just 14 years the block reward will be just 0.78btc. We either have to hope that the price rises enough to compensate or that 8mb blocks are regularly full to create a fee market. Hope isn't a word we should use when talking about a hundred billion dollar store of value. I'd be much more inclined to try a 200kb increase and see what we learned. But even before that we need to see more SW adoption. Kind of defeats the point of backwards compatibility if we hardfork off half the network.

Ignore all these noobs. What is CB withdrawal fee? Without knowing I would imagine it could be easily a dollar. If it's a dollar you're paying an extra 2% fee each time. For the sake of panicking over such small amounts theres really no point withdrawing each time. Maybe every 3 or 4 paychecks withdraw. Also, each withdraw will create a new output in your personal wallet, which when you come to send it will make the transactions bigger and cost more in fees when you send it on somewhere else. Make sure you're using a segwit compatible wallet too, or else you're potentially.goinh to lose loads in fees.

There must be more people than me in other poorer countries. Also, even at my other house where I have 20Mb/s, running a node affects my latency already. Playing cod with just 1mb blocks makes my ping go crazy. I could throttle, but would most non technical people. I know this is very poor reasoning, but my idea of public money is one in ten people using the network to be supporting it with a node.

Only amateurs would rejoice at this news. Bitcoin is so far from being ready for this kind of adoption. Unless they use some custodial funding wallet that transfers money from buyer to seller off chain we are screwed. LN isnt quite there yet. Change my mind.

You're confusing validation with confirmation. Every tx that enters the mem pool is validated even before it's conformed. Ie the full node checks that all signatures are valid, and the transaction conforms to standards etc. 
When you send a tx, it references the previous tx ID. In the case of a chain of unconfirmed tx this means that if the first tx is malliated then the second tx fails. This is a huge issue, since you don't even need to be the spender to fuck with someone.

My first bubble in 2013 I made no btc gains. My second bubble in 2013 I made 17% bitcoin gains. My third bubble in 2017 I made 213% bitcoin gains. Who gives a fuck about fiat losses. I'm all in it for the btc gains. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 20:11:26
Yes. It's quite a clever way to save space in a transaction. Rather than having to specify an amount to send, change, AND a fee, it's just assumed that anything after the send amount and the change amount is a fee. Obviously if you create raw transactions then you better make sure you know what you're doing.

I wholeheartedly agree with you. Banking the unbanked was one one of the main reasons I joined bitcoin in early 2012. However, as the saying goes, Jack of all trades, master of none. I would not be prepared to sacrifice an inch of decentralisation and robustness in exchange for lower fees. Poor people aren't losing out anyway. There are hundred of other coins that they can pay next to no fees for reduced security. The idea we should be focusing of keeping fees negligible on the worlds most secure ledger is just downright silly. Nobody is losing out. The thousands of projects bitcoin spawned are all suitable for meeting these peoples needs. Its bitcoin maximalist to suggest that everything should be done on Bitcoin. Its literally basic business strategy. 
As for bcash, I'm happy for them to attempt to serve the unbanked, after all, it is spawned from bitcoin. It's a shame that there is almost no real adoption though. It would have been interesting to see what effect full 32mb blocks had on the number of nodes.
@_date: 2018-12-24 20:58:36
Federated sidechains like liquid are a far better way and far more appropriate way for exchanges to move funds between themselves. It's just not safe enough for exchanges to put any meaningful amount of btc in the LN right now. 
LN is just a weapon in the armoury for now. It has amazing uses, but I'd like to see more SW adoption before anything else. I'd even be happy for the memory pool to get clogged again and fees to rise to promote more SW adoption.

You have a very poor understanding of the situation. I wish I had the time to help. You would imagine proponents of decentralisation would understand. Unfortunately not.

@_date: 2018-12-22 08:58:40
Money in an address that only ever received and didn't send is safe. Until you spend from an address the public key is not visible, only a hash of the public key. This makes it phenomenally harder. People keeping coins in addresses they already spent from are theoretically at risk first. Satoshis coins are in addresses that display the public key (THEY didn't introduce the upgraded hashed private key until a few years after launch). So his coins are like a Canary in the coal mine effectively

That's very kind of you. 
However, with some excellent trading it's around a 47% loss, ie I increased my my btc stack almost 3x. 
Also, even -80% off absolutely stinking rich is still stinking rich. I wouldn't trust more than £500k in the bank at any one time. It's still plenty to life off until the next bull run though.

Use an OTC desk for anything $50k plus. It makes exchanges too nervous to do these kind of numbers, especially for individuals. Although in the past I have had multiple successful 6 figure withdraws from Bitstamp and Kraken as an individual, but this was many years ago.

How many stupid people can I come across in one day on reddit? If you're going to correct someone, in future you should Google the word first before you make an idiot if yourself again. 
I know youre too stupid and lazy to Google it for yourself so here you are:
 "a useful or valuable thing or person.
an item of property owned by a person or company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments, or legacies."
Or would you like to give me one asset that isn't measured in USD? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:11:49
I always think it's wise to assume you know nothing. So every time I hear people say Bitcoin is dead I assume they COULD be correct. It hasn't stopped me keeping on average 90-98% of my net wealth in Bitcoin for the last 6.5 years though. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:23:07
The only reason you wouldn't fix it is if you thought the ability to change the tx ID after it's submitted isn't a bug, which it definately is. Not only was it fixed in an elegant backwards compatible way, core managed to include a blocksize increase. There really isn't any downsides if you understand the technology. You'll find a lot of people who don't understand the technology and the trade offs in r/btc.

Holding fiat is outside my risk tolerance, so I just look out to high cap shitcoins to buy at the bottom, like bcash. Usually I only make 3-4 shitcoin  trades a year but I've never lost money, and sometimes like bcash just last week I've doubled my Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:55:29
Holding is for mugs. Bit min went from $1000 to almost $20000 and then back down to $3000. If you can't at least double your Bitcoin during that time you're doing something wrong. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:46:12
Liquid is more of a business to business off chain scaling solution. It can be configured to be as centralised or as decentralised as you need it, where are LN is always trust less. There are certain times in B2B transactions that bitcoins irreversibility can be an issue.

You are so intellectually out of your depth i suggest never broaching this subject again.
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:20:13
When you send a bitcoin transaction, really all you're doing is signing a.message that says "send x bitcoin from this address, to this address". Unless it's written in this specific way it cant be used to send anything. So instead of payment instructions you can just sign a message that someone else gave you. They cant use the signature to do anything so it's safe to give it to someone, but they can check cryptographically the same way we verify transactions that it's an authorised message signed by the private key.
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:12:58
This is a total fucking noob playing with leverage... I'll repeat my claim. If you can't double your Bitcoin after the bubble we just had, you're a noob. Everyone was a noob at some point. It's just a case of how fast you can learn.

Bcash is a fucking joke, but I'm not going to lie, I've traded it more than any other coin since it was created from thin air. I have never made such gains on any coin.

These people don't learn, they WILL be back to give me more of their Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:49:47
Unless your output plus miner fee adds upto exactly the total of the three outputs you would also specify change going back to on e of your own address. Also on the topic of miner fee, to save space you dont even have to specify a miner fee, it is just assumed that anything not specified as an output or change is a miner fee. People have messed up with this before sending themselves 0.01btc from a 10btc output without specifying a change address, meaning the miner fee was 9.99btc (just an example, people have lost hundreds of btc this way. 
Also when you digitally sign the for each output, you are specifying the address it's being sent to in that signature, its not just any digital signature, its instructions signed with that key.
