I understand your point, a lot of people are hoarding it. But you can use it at a lot more places than you think...

Take my upvote. It's the last downvote you'll get from me. Maybe with the extra 2 internet points you can buy yourself a nice dinner.

That's pretty nice of you to give them the option to receive  $13.20 in BTC for Christmas. When I was little, I had no idea what to do with $26.60.

If someone invested 20k in 2013 the profit on that would be huge. Like any other investor, it is illegal to hide that profit correct? I assume this would be under the 15% capital gains tax?

This "news" excited me for a second until I had that same thought. Who uses gold for anything other than burying it for a rainy day or putting it on a finger.

These banking institutions used to be based on integrity and managed by people of actual intelligence. Now they are just your standard corporate profit mill trying to extract money where they can.

Most I'd say, unless your buying new (which I would never do).

I wonder if this is the hexabot / chain group asshat.

If this were in the USA we would be reading about their record profits next quarter. (I'm not saying we won't but.....you get the idea)

Redditor for less than a week posting predictions about bitcoin. lolz

The market is/was getting very aggressive. So many coins out there, hard forks and soft forks. How the hell are average people supposed to keep up with that. I understand why everyone is running from crypto right now. I just hope BTC survives and the other noise dies a quick death.

The US "power of force" is quickly deteriorating. Republicans think it's ok to cut taxes and raise spending, increasing our debt just to stay in power. This isn't sustainable. We've never been so far underwater and it's only getting worse. Our leaders are pointing fingers at "dreamers" and "millennials" when really it has been their failure to adapt to changing times. They grew up when jobs were plentiful and you could land a good paying job with no diploma and retire early and well off. That just plain doesn't fucking exist anymore and no one at the top seems to realize this. Democrats are no better but I feel they are slightly more aligned with the real world trends we see today. 
The real problem is we are being led on by a bunch of old fucks that don't want to change, and fail to realize that the US is not the same US they are nostalgic about.

The real issue I have with this is the fact a bank can forbid you from spending your money....like wtf how is this legal

$3.00 to 4 Billion is a large range.

I had .5 bitcoins in 2015 and then Cryptsy happened and I didn't notice.

Why is this "so sad"? I gladly wait the 7 days for a safe transaction vs using some shady instant transfer site that will most likely just steal my money or leak my information.

Addiction starts somewhere, once your hooked I get it. It becomes a physical dependence and without the mental strength / support system needed to break that dependence you're in trouble. The addiction starts somewhere, that first shot of heroine or that first puff of meth. We all make mistakes, that doesn't mean that are not poor decisions.

lol, well how about something better than keeping coins on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:08:19
Thanks, I'm leaning at getting a Trezor. I don't have a lot of coin but I'm in this for the long game and I think the cost is worth it.

Bitcoins caused people to od on fentanyl, interesting. Here I was thinking poor life decisions led to these things.

Unfortunately I tried to get smart and landed some private college loans that were sold to Citibank. fuck this.

At face value this is true, but they did this by simply increasing the block size. Doing this over and over to keep up will lead to huge block sizes and an exponentially increasing block chain size. BTC's total size is like...what 200 gigs and it started in 2009. It's large but that pace of growth is manageable and things like LN and segwit only help reduce the growth rate (better efficiency). 
Lets now envision a situation where we mass adoption and have 1 GB blocks sizes and the blockchain is approaching petabytes to keep up with the number of transactions. Who's going to run a node when you need a datafarm and 10gig internet to keep up?

The Bcash propaganda machine which goal is to actively mislead the public, that's the scam. Bcash itself is just another coin, unfortunately with two very vocal very invested retards screaming nonsense.

Possible this does not seem, Agree I don't. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:52:36
It would be interesting if a coin could limit the max hashrate of a device somehow, that way everyone gets the same return. 
I don't know how this might effect said coin though.

Think of it this way, Chevy makes the Corvette. If some Chinese company started making a copycat Corvette 7 or 8 years later, which one would you call the original? 
Bitcoin is the Corvette Chevy created, 
BCH is a copycat. It might be worse, it might be better but it's still a copycat and shouldn't have a claim to the original name. Its simply misdirection, misinformation.

These banks fighting Bitcoin/Crypto will need to adopt or they will suffer the same fate of Blockbuster/Aol/BlackBerry
