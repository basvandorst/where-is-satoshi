That attitude will, in practice, get you nowhere in life

But how do you know that that good friend isn't a reptilian overlord who's set on destroying the economy?

Wow what did ol' Trumpy do to you?

Still, ~$300 down from mid-year though. The data is misleading, but it will take a big shake-up and some advances in the technology to make Bitcoin pull through. Also for the government to stop being assholes about it, just because it doesn't directly benefit them as much as using *their* money does.
@_date: 2014-05-25 00:41:08
I don't want serious discussion of Bitcoin necessarily, news articles or anything more in depth than just "spotted Bitcoin lol" is fine. But OP didn't post a news article, OP posted a picture of a headline in a local newspaper...
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:42:10
Yes. Why...?
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:15:26
How long have you been into bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:22:03
In order to paint a realistic picture of the Bitcoin market people need to see both the good and the bad. *Nothing* is without a negative article or two, and this is way more informative and indicative of Bitcoin's future than "hey look where else accepts Bitcoin".

It's delusional to realise that SR broke the law? Sweet.
@_date: 2014-04-11 10:19:29
Oh so you mean you use it to purchase things? Fair enough, I misunderstood
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:35:33
What flea markets are as big as the entirety of SR and don't pay tax?

What do you think will happen if it doesn't change, and how do you think it should change?

I'm sorry but you and I have different ideas of boring if you think that this post is not boring.

Total from the list is 11. Take two off for each of China, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore and one off for each of Canada and Australia.
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:43:11
Yah because all of the others are nowhere near as popular... People don't much talk about (and upvote to the frontpage) stuff when there's little interest in the topic

Selling psudeoephedrine isn't inherently illegal. Silkroad was.

I did not subscribe here to see every mention of Bitcoin anywhere else in "the real world". But that is now what 95% of the posts getting to the front page are. Unsubscribed.

Yes, it was. An unregistered non-tax-paying online marketplace, the entire concept is illegal, before you even start considering aaallll the other illegal stuff done on there.
I'm happy for you thinking SR was super cool and this pluto pete guy is so cool fighting against the man having done nothing wrong and how you're a total freedom fighter. But none of that is true. SR was illegal, PlutoPete broke the law (FBI have actually already said they would convict sellers who sold only legal items), you broke the law using it, and if you get reprimanded then that sucks, but it's on you. Pluto knew what he was doing was wrong, he knew he could lose his money, he knew he could go to jail. If he didn't, then he was kidding himself.

Somebody not wanting to use something doesn't mean that they don't understand it. Given the same information different people will draw different conclusions. Your opinion is no better than theirs just as theirs is no better than yours.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:46:13
What "right reasons" include holding onto the bitcoins for months? Serious question
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:04:23


I really disagree with this. The value is going up not because people are realising the practical potential for bitcoins. The value is going up because people expect it to keep going up, so they buy in.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:02:36
I spent 30 on an ounce of weed. Would have sold at or before 100 anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:15:16
Well yeah I trust its network quite a lot. That doesn't have anything to do with my comment though?
Incidentally, Bitcoin may not be hacked but any exchange is a weak point. 850k btc went missing from Mt Gox just 3 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:37:36
Lol I've been closely following bitcoins since 2011 pal. Its value as a means for wealth transfer hasn't changed much, all that's changed is the hype around it.
You talk about its real world value like it's actually used for that purpose much. Yeah it is a bit, but most of what it's used for now (and for the last couple of years) is trading/investing.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:34:08
If bitcoin crashes to &lt;1k I can't imagine it won't keep going down, and not break 1k again for a *long* time.
This bubble is a lot bigger than the previous ones, and its value is more speculative now than ever.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:26:02
Why do you say that? How has its value been proven? It is very little more than a trading commodity right now, so if people's faith in it dies then so will its value.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:37:02
I thought it was done for good after it went from $30 to $4 in 2011. Took nearly two years to get back to $30.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:38:06
They are doing those things because people are buying and selling them. All that any of those do is enable trading. They are not evidence of Bitcoins being used for their intended purpose.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:12:33
Let's just put my life on pause for the foreseeable future just in case this untested trading commodity blows up beyond any predictions.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:22:45
It doesn't discourage people from using it at all though, because they could just buy more at the rate it's at at the time if they want to save.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:09:27
Don't think that your portfolio is diverse because you have different cryptocurrencies. If Bitcoin goes down then so will all others. And when that happens, they will never recover to where they were before the crash.
Don't bet more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:13:01
Maybe, eventually 
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:08:52
New investors 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:14:39
I mean they effectively are new investors though
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:57:41
Maybe, but I thought that at 100
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:57:53
Sure I suppose not, but I can't think what else could be causing it with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:19:20
You could have it end on the final frame instead of looping? If I'd have succeeded in scanning it I'd think it were a great little animation!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:21:07
Those posts will just encourage a crash. But another crash could be fun, I think for verious reasons that it would overall help the bitcoin market in the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:34:08
Still probably not as much as they would have paid in bank fees...

This isn't a suitable logo though, this is a neat image which may have potential to be used occasionally. Cool as a wallpaper, though.

That would be all very well and good if bitcoin transactions could be verified by the receiver instantaneously, but they can't.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:00:37
Bitcoins were a pretty big deal 2-3 months ago...

Balloons with the bitcoin symbol on them, is that supposed to be some sort of symbolism...?
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:01:30
If the bankers want a cut of it they will get it. Bitcoins start being taxed, become like all other currencies, they die out. People seem to think that the internet is some impenetrable fortress just because there's a couple of sites up that the people in power don't want up, but they're getting a hell of a lot better at fighting them. Plus since bitcoins are mainly handled through legal and therefore open sites/companies those companies which you rely on for all of your bitcoin needs will either be stamped out or they'll succumb to political pressure and soon won't at all resemble the company you once knew.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:32:29
People don't seem to realise that the ability to pay by virtual currency of any form, including a credit card, is a service which is being provided to them. The infrastructure set up behind that service is pretty vast and requires a lot of maintenance and security, so there are charges on using them which some small businesses choose to not pay. But really, it isn't hard to carry a little cash.
I'm all for bitcoins, but I don't like how they're being used as a means to attack banks and their policies. If bitcoins were well established enough to be in a small pub (looks like a pub in the picture?) then there would be charges to use bitcoins there too, which many businesses would again choose to not pay. You can't expect that level of convenience provided for free just because you're used to it.
