The supply is not capped, but the mining reward halfs over time. There will never be 120 million coins. It will get to 119.9999999 and keep going but it will never hit 120 million.
Also, proof of stake comes out soon for ethereum.
"Staking" means you put your ETH into a smart contract that verifies the next generated block in the chain (instead of mining--which solves an algorithm to generate the next block)...which means no more [or very very little] costly electricity for "mining" (that in itself is beyond revolutionary).
Instead of having to mine: you stake. Now the reward of ETH for each generated block which used to be given to miners is split amongst the stakers in the smart contract that verified the block. It is split proportionally based on how much ETH you have staked.
So the more ETH you have, the bigger portion of each reward you get. Your "reward" is automatically sent to a separate wallet that you specify. It's like you're getting paid dividends every few seconds. Imagine you stake 100 ETH and therefore start earning $.01 every second...that comes out to $864 a day. A DAY. Even if you earned $.0001 cent per second, you'd still be earning $8.64 a day...$60 a week, $241.92 per month, $2900 per year...for doing NOTHING. That's incredible and consider yourself EXTREMELY blessed that you know about ETH right now...because when Casper is implemented, that's it: game over. ETH will easily hit $10k, BTC will sink into obscurity and the world as we know it will be changed forever.
Actually--i think i just sold myself on Casper. In explaining this, i think i--for the first time--genuinely understood the significance of how ETH will change the world. 
To all readers: You buy ETH now. As much as you can, and you keep buying--whether it crashes or booms, you keep buying. Then you stake everything you've got and you will either be set for life or have a nice extra income for as long as the ETH blockchain exists.
Uh...but yeah.... bitcoin is clearly superior. See you next year ;)

If you think ether has an unlimited supply them I'm sorry but you're retarded. 120mil cap. Now get out of here bitchcoin troll.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:00:38
Lol you're wrong about that and I feel bad for you missing out in proof of stake, but I guess some people just have to learn the hard way.
The mining reward is halfed every so often so realistically when the cap is 120 mil it will get to 199.999999 but never actually reach 120mil.
I'm just gonna leave this here as well :

Mainly because many btc holders are learning about Ethereum and Proof of stake is near ready Q1-Q2 2018.

It's not a bug in the protocol. It was a bug in the code that a random developer made in Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts on ethereum's platform.
You could create a shitty contract if you wanted and blame ethereum for it, but that's still not going to change what's to come in 2018. You should be very, *very* afraid. Because you won't even see it coming before it's too late.

That has nothing to do with bubbles.

You'll get a higher return on investment with ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:49:55
Not to mention ethereum is going to be the backbone for Web 3.0 and pretty much anything that has to do with blockchain. Later this month Dubai and Tesla Motors will announce their integration of ethereum, as well as Honeywell and other brand names.
Once ethereum gets to billions of transactions per second, it will be game over.
Well, it already is game over, the btc worshipers just don't realize it yet.

Look up metcalfe's law and then come talking. ��

Bitcoin gains this year: increased by 9.4244 times, or a 942.44% increase.
Ethereum gains this year: increased by 26.7322 times, or a 2673.22% increase.
Sometimes dumb people simply doubt things they don't understand. ����
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:27:49
Yeah that's not more secure at all. Stay cold storage and just get the blockfolio app.
Also, investing in ethereum will give you way more gains next year and beyond if you diversify into eth.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:42:29
It's actually not cherry picking at all. It's simple facts. 
I guess I'm right about the whole not understanding part. �� 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:05:47
According to Metcalfe's law bitcoin is actually overvalued right now. I hear your reasoning, but it's taken extremely out of context when you use the word 'value'.

[If Ethereum is the only crypto you don't have, you're going to have a very very regretful year in 2018.](
BP, Mastercard, Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, JP Morgan, ING, Toyota, many banks, and many more are building applications on top of ethereum's platform as we speak. After Casper's release ethereum will be able to process billions of transactions a second, and right now it is actually processing more transactions than all other cryptocurrencies - **combined.** Also fees are way cheaper than Bitcoin and ethereum doesn't have 45,000 pending transactions in the backlog. 
Also, ethereum gained 5180% this year, or a 51x increase.
Bitcoin only gained 1210% this year, or a 12x increase. Ethereum right now is similar to what bitcoin was in 2013, except next year ethereum will be seeing at the very least $10,000 by the end of the year.
Do your research, invest in ethereum, and get ready to retire in 3 years.

Eth will give you a higher profit yield than btc.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:53:25
Unless governments start banning bitcoin like China did. The Elites could easily crash the market if they wanted to.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:27:32
I can check for you.
