Yes, even if every actual payment transaction is on LN we would still eventually need larger blocks just to accommodate payment channels opening and settling. I don't think there is disagreement about this it's just a matter of when.

LN doesn't allow you to create new bitcoin. LN is basically like a prepaid bitcoin card that allows you to make microtransactions with the card or close it. The microtransactions are actual bitcoin transactions so it's all bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-23 22:48:07
It's not really proof of stake, though I appreciate the sentiment. People would need to hold coins in a channel on LN but *proof of stake* in this context means voting on the next block using purchasing power rather than hashing power.

Hey Chris, I appreciate the article. The main contention I have with this is that you consider a third party in a multisig address to be an oracle. I think the turing complete guys would contend that a real oracle would be a schelling coin game where participants are appropriately incentivized to give the correct answer to a particular proposition and other measures such as stakeholders having the ability to escalate the game if they feel the outcome is fraudulent.
For example lets say Alice wants to buy 1 tokens worth of Flakka from Bob. Alice sends 1 token to an escrow contract that holds the funds. (Bob and Alice of course reviewed the source code carefully before doing this.) The contract can either pay out to Bob when Alice receives the product or enter into a dispute resolution phase where Bob can submit evidence that he actually sent the package like images of Flakka, an oddly stained Fedex receipt etc. Participants can then review the evidence and decide if Bob should still be paid or if Alice should be refunded via a game.
In this case in order to falsify the oracle Bob would need to bribe a majority of the schelling coin participants. Since the oracle game would be public on the blockchain Bob could for example create a bounty contract that pays out to all the participants who say he sent the to Flakka even if he didn't. In that case Alice would have a reason to escalate the payouts of the oracle all the way up until the payout of the bribe is more than the amount Bob is owed or even higher because fuck Bob anyways.
We can debate the various attack vectors that Bob could use against such a game, but I don't think there is not much debate that if I did want to do this on a blockchain in order to avoid becoming the next Ross Ulbricht, I would have an easier time doing it on a "Turing complete" (not actually) blockchain because the more expressive scripting language would allow the escrow contract to have many possible states.

Well if you have a payment channel open and the connecting node goes offline then that payment channel is useless until the channel closes. A large provider could have multiple servers with the ability to service the same channel. At the same time if the entire world is using one blockchain then on-chain transaction fees could be rather high and thus  opening and closing channels all the time just to maintain the ability to make micro payments could become expensive.

While it still an open question as to what the final topology of the lightning network will look like everything else is well understood.


LN transactions *are* bitcoin transactions, it's just that the receiver does not to broadcast the transaction to the blockchain until the payment channel is ready to close, instead they give the sender the option to send a larger transaction which replaces the old one, the difference being the micropayment. Do you understand this?




Certainly any way of aggregating payments reduces the total fees for miners but this does not necessarily mean that miners will not be adequately incentivized.
I'm also not sure why you think this is a bad thing. There is no way bitcoin can scale if miners must put every transaction on the blockchain. You still need block transactions to open, close or add funds to a payment channel and in a situation where LN is successful this will happen often enough to pay for mining.


See above.


The cost of running a lightning node is extremely low, as in a normal desktop can process perhaps 1000s of transactions per second. So the competition for fees between lightning nodes will be quite fierce and unlikely to outdo miners.
@_date: 2016-04-10 19:41:38
The fees for each hop are variable so there is no advantage to pretending to be multiple hops. The routing algorithm will choose the route with the lowest total fee which could in some cases be negative.

To be honest, Lightning Network is the most bullish news in bitcoin. This second layer means that bitcoin will actually be usable as an on site point of sale payment method. Likewise micro-payments have never been possible before and they mean the possibility of many services that currently rely on subscriptions or advertising to adopt a new revenue model.
@_date: 2016-04-08 13:43:32
The minimum practical transaction over VISA is currently around 5 USD in part because of fees vendors need to pay and also because of the time cost for a merchant because of the need to share personal details. That rules out a lot of use cases, like paying for internet access by the megabyte, streaming music by the minute, downloading a single article from the WSJ without a subscription. 5 USD rules out a single beer where I live. Lightning would allow you to make a micropayment to anyone you want, and you would not need to even give any information to that entity, you would not even need a payment channel directly with them you can just send out a tiny transaction to the network, perhaps 1kb of data and a fraction of a penny of value, and start receiving service. This is a value proposition for Bitcoin that goes beyond what VISA or cash are capable of.
A lightning transaction fits into a single internet packet and resolves instantly.

I just use Flakka in the bathtub. That's what it's for right?
If my understanding is correct than what you are saying is basically that no situations exist where parties would prefer to submit to adjudication by a complex on-chain contract, that they will always prefer to use a third party (another human or an off-chain computation). I'd say that no-one knows yet if that is correct and it's a little early to make a prediction. Turing complete contracts are an experiment and we won't know the result of that experiment until such capability is available to the market for a long period of time. My suspicion is that it's going to be very good for some things, and unneccessary for many other things.
There is no exit scam from a Schelling game as the participants must spend money in order to participate and only profit if their answer is in the majority. This is also the reason why bribing such a game is not cheap, because the bribe is not only competing with the fees paid by the contract sponsoring the game but with the security deposits made by all of it's participants. If Bob knows Alice can always escalate the game to the point where Bob's bribe will definitely be unprofitable then there is no reason for Bob to try the bribe in the first place. It's mutually assured destruction so to speak.
Is this better or cheaper than a centralized oracle? Well it's easier to coordinate a bribe with a single individual than to coordinate collusion with an unknown and open set of participants. Likewise the decentralized oracle has to expend considerably less effort in the area of human resources: consider for example the difficulties Ross Ulbricht had with the people he employed to help manage all of his customers.
Finally consider that an 3th3r3um transaction is likely to cost significantly less than a bitcoin transaction of similar complexity since in most cases the contract itself is just an instance of an object whose class has already been uploaded to the blockchain. The contract then, in most cases just stores a small amount of state information which is destroyed once the whole interaction is complete. Every bitcoin transaction by comparison contains all of the code and data it needs forever.
@_date: 2016-04-15 04:27:45
If a majority of the network decides to change bitcoin's block subsidy then that's what will happen. I don't personally want that to happen but that's the definition of consensus right? Bitcoins not magically unchanging. It's magically consensus following. Now if it did turn out that fees were no longer enough to incentivize mining when the block subsidy gets too small than I guess the subsidy will have to change, since what good are your deflationary bitcoins if no-one is getting paid to mine their ledger. 
I don't think the soft fork changes anything fundamental about bitcoin. The block subsidy for example cannot be changed with a soft fork. So what is it you are so worried about exactly? What's wrong with 5 minute blocks for example, that would automatically double the throughput of the network.

Well in order to work out it has to be the amount that people would be willing to spend to store their money and setup payments. That's how much the average individual will pay in fees per year in a working LN scenario. So banking fees, wire transfer fees are a good indicator though we hope that Bitcoin would be significantly lower.

I'm well aware of golds role in international trade and do not regard it as a relic but it does not back dollars I assure you.
I agree that bitcoin cannot be a reserve currency in it's present form, just not for the reasons listed in the original post. Those I disagree with. That's all.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:49:19
Dollars are not backed by gold. Nixon did away with the link between gold and dollars in 1971. Please for your own good, do your research and get an understanding of what is actually going on the world today, this is not the time to be ignorant of how this system works.
This conversation is not about whether bitcoin *is* a reserve currency but about whether it *could be* one. Certainly adoption by vendors, financial products and etc would necessarily need to grow with bitcoin in order for that to be possible. 
As to the comparison to a bank account, so there are many such services using multisig to allow a trusted third party to observe, approve and insure bitcoin transactions, much like a bank will do. Of course there is a cost associated with this service greater than the cost of managing your own private keys, a little bit like fees on a checking account but there is no technical reason why this isn't possible and in fact it's happening today. In truth if someone steals from your bank card and is able to use your money to buy goods and services the money is really gone, the bank makes you whole by dipping into the money that everyone is collectively paying them in fees. A bitcoin bank could do the same thing, the point is with bitcoin it's your choice to do that whereas with dollars you would need to transact only with cash to circumvent a third party.

It may be true that bitcoins will never be a reserve currency. But not for the reasons this guy lists, in fact this person clearly misunderstands most things about bitcoin. Some counterpoints:


You get a deep bond market because you are a reserve currency, not the other way around. Governments can denominate bonds in any currency they want, so can companies. Fractional reserve is also possible if people chose to value the bitcoin IOUS issued by governments or banks.


Um... sure they will. People owned houses before fiat money, they also made loans. Huge housing bubbles, much harder with bitcoin.


When money flows into bitcoin's the price goes up. That's how the market cap of bitcoins went from $0 to $3 Billion. The same thing can continue to happen if people choose to buy and value bitcoins.


Bitcoin's can be subdivided essentially infinitely. Widespread adoption would mean most people would never be able to own an entire bitcoin.


The market can and already does provide escrow services as well as enforce reputation metrics.


The same thing is true of cash right. Visa providing a kind of escrow, they prevent transactions that do not seem legit.  You pay for the fraud insurance through the fees you pay visa. A bitcoin escrow can provide the same insurance using multisig. In fact with bitcoin there is less fraud because identity theft becomes almost impossible.


Multisig and decentralization will solve this problem in short order.


The dollar has low volatility because of the large amount of value stored in it, and the wide variety of prices denominated in it. Bitcoin would have a similar lack of volatility if the market cap increased by a few order of magnitude. You have low volatility *because* you are a reserve currency, not the other way around.


For small transactions off chain payment networks (i.e. lightning etc) will be necessary. These are essentially secured by the blockchain but not processed by it. For large transactions say &gt; 1000 USD, since when is 10 minutes a long time.


Ummm... you should have visited Manhattan during the last blackout, people I saw emptying piggy banks onto the bar to buy drinks. Dollars are digital, very few people hoard cash.


In digital time they are ancient.
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:23:43
I think you've missed the main point which rebuts basically all or your arguments, if it grew to the size of a reserve currency then all of the things you are asking for would be present, including deep markets, interest baring lones, escrow and transaction insurance. In fact those are already available. All currencies are volatile but it's safe to assume that as the market cap increases volatility will decrease to a level where users do not notice it. Having prices for goods denominated in BTC would also help.
The total number of bitcoins is arbitrary and only affects the exchange rate denomination, the network can store as much value as people need it to simply by increasing the exchange rate.
The real barriers for bitcoin are social and technological but solutions exist and there is no reason to assume that they won't be implemented. If there are economic fallacies in my original post, I think you've failed to explain them so far.
@_date: 2015-06-29 05:29:52
Right... so the value of a bitcoin is based on trust in a network which maintains a ledger of value and rejects actors who don't follow a set of rules about how that ledger is updated. It's fine if you don't trust that network, there are many good reasons not to, but to call it's backing "hope and faith" means you probably don't know how game theory works or really what a cryptocurrency *is*.
This is probably not true of dollars, the rules I mean, but instead of spamming you with libertarian grandstanding I'd rather hear what you think dollars are backed by? What does the value on my bank statement represent exactly?
edit: And just so you understand, I don't think people should be encouraging Greek citizens to buy bitcoins or suggest that bitcoin represents a solution for Greece. That's not even a remote possibility nor would it make sense for any but a few Greeks who understand it and want to take a risk on bitcoins to buy any. But I do think that as bitcoin matures it could be valued as a reserve currency as the dollar is now and have the properties you suggest it doesn't. That's what I'm arguing here.

I was converted to wanting to keep the block size small a few months ago after initially supporting BitcoinXT. In the future the blockchain will just provide the consensus layer of bitcoin,  it will not be the layer where most transactions occur.
The consensus layer just needs to be as lightweight, decentralized and free of spam as possible. We could choose a path where we decide to leverage Moores law and project forward that larger blocks will not necessarily compromise the system, or we can realize that small blocks mean that the consensus layer will remain as lean and mean as possible. If Moore's law continues it will mean that the resources needed to maintain a nodes in a small block scenario will become trivial. This translates to a more robust and ubiquitous bitcoin.
Decentralization is what makes bitcoin bitcoin, it must always be the top priority.

You can have centralized layers with a decentralized foundation. Coinbase for example. You cannot have a decentralized layer on top of a centralized foundation.


I don't think you understand how lightning network works. Once you establish a channel with a peer you can send as many transactions across the network as you want. Anyone can be a peer. There is no need to aggregate transactions or any other such thing. Once you close a channel you can open one with any other peer you want to. There is no cost to a peer to open a channel with you if you are funding the channel, so there is no reason to believe that the system would gravitate to a few large service providers. In fact the opposite is likely.


At issue is the capacity of a node to properly verify a block, not the size of the blockchain. Look at the number of full nodes currently, around 6000. Do you want that number to go up or down? Can you explain how Bitcoin Unlimited would make the number go up? This is the heart of what makes bitcoin decentralized. Screw with that number and you screw with it's only value proposition: individual financial sovereignty.


In bitcoin, one bug *does* make your team incompetent. Sorry. Too much is on the line. The testing process that has gone into technologies such as Segwit, are orders of magnitude more secure than what we saw yesterday. The market is not going to choose the BU developers. Your best bet at this point is to continue to lobby the community to do a 2 or 8 mb hardfork in the future. In the meantime please research and support Segwit. LN and related technologies are not finished but we can't develop them further without Segwit on the mainnet because of the maleability fix it includes. The miners and Bitcoin Unlimited people are literally holding back tons of real development that will lead to many avenues of scaling both on and off chain.

I highly encourage you to research into how lightning network works. I think you will find there is nothing centralizing about it and it adds huge utility to bitcoin.

Miners have the power to order transactions and construct blocks. They are employees of the network, not it's leaders. That's it. You do not have special privileges because you mine. Users determine what the consensus rules are by what software they run. The majority of the bitcoin community more than 70% want segwit, miners are blocking it. 95% or nodes run Bitcoin Core software because those are the developers we trust. If you don't agree, please mine an out of consensus block and see who accepts those bitcoins.

The only thing I would disagree with is that there are many ways to increase the throughput of Bitcoin without increasing block size. We'd like to exhaust all those options before we start using up more resources. Segwit for example does reduce fees by increasing the number of transactions per block. But inevitably some level of fees are necessary to distinguish valuable transactions from spam, blockchain transactions are going to become a precious resource no matter what you do so the idea behind LN and other options is to give people the power of Bitcoin as a decentralized payment network without overusing the resources of the blockchain itself.

Every time a miner mines a block of bitcoin transactions they can put a tag on the block that indicates what version of software they are supporting. As blocks are being created the software is looking at the percentage of blocks that have a specific tag and will change it's behavior once it reaches a certain threshold of support. We have two competing development teams with different ideas about how the software should be upgraded.
In this case BU, Bitcoin Unlimited would like to change the rules for how much data each block can contain, it's currently limited to 1MB. This change will not be backward compatible and so older or alternate software will not support accept these larger blocks and the network itself will split into two incompatible groups of computers, an event known as a *hard fork*. 
Alternatively Segwit is another revision of the software which adds functionality to bitcoin nodes, fixes some problems and adds some capacity to each block without changing the format of the blocks themselves. Since it does not break the current rules, older non-segwit enabled software will still accept segwit blocks even though they will essentially be blind to the new capabilities and unable to take advantage of the added capacity until they upgrade. Since this process does not split the network it is known as a *soft fork*.

I think he may have deleted his own comments. If it's really the mods, then they should truly be ashamed. It's a perfectly reasonable conversation. I don't honestly read beyond mostly headlines and links. So I'm not super in tune with what happens here.
Dash implements some kind of scheme to incentivize nodes and it's generally a problem because some of the income that would be going to hashing power is now going to a node ecosystem that can be easily sybil attacked. Many participants run lots of nodes to maximize their income. The point of having lots of nodes is to have lots of people in diverse geographical and political zones maintaining the blockchain, not Evan Duffield spoofing 1000 nodes of his own on the Amazon cloud.
In the case of bitcoin, there *is* already an incentive to run a node, and that is having highly trustless access to the blockchain. If we bring down the cost enough as Moores law progresses and give guarantees to dedicated hardware manufacturers about the parameters moving forward then you could see the cost be so low that it's becomes trivial to include a full node in all kinds of devices. At that point bitcoin could really become the internet layer of value transfer that we all want it to be. If you are expecting frequent hard forks, you will frequently make nodes obsolete and can give no such guarantees.
Keep in mind the number of full nodes has plateaud for some time. We want to make sure it at least stays the same if not grows.

Except that you don't seem to want to recognize that increasing the blocksize has the effect of centralizing the base layer.


From the perspective of an end user a lightning channel is like a prepaid debit card. The existence of this has no effect on whether you can make a normal bitcoin transaction, it just makes the proverbial coffee transaction and many types of micro-transactions feasable. Without a solution like this, it does not matter what block size limit you set, the bitcoin network will never be able to handle even the transaction volume of a small country.


LN is irrelevant to node count. But just so you understand, we want Moores law to make it trivial to run a full node on a phone. Bitcoin Unlimited will not get you to where we want to take you.


Good. Then do your research and come to an understanding of why the Core roadmap is what it is.


We don't have a choice in this matter, no matter how big you make blocks.

It's more about the computations needed to validate a block and the speed at which the blockchain is growing. The limit needs to be somewhere and if we keep it where it is then it becomes more and more trivial to run a full node on less and less expensive machines so that the blockchain becomes as ubiquitous as internet routing. We want that and to scale on layer 2, that's why we support Segwit, at least first, because it enables layer 2.

No, I'm actually not opposed to increasing the block size limit in principle, or to decreasing it, I don't know what the optimum number is and I don't know where the threshold is where we start loosing full nodes and increasing centralization. Nobody does really because there's a human behavior element to the system. The only incentive to run a full node right now is gain a high level of trust that most people don't care about. The number of nodes has effectively plateaued for some time. So given that knowledge it's better to have Moore's law effectively decrease the load that each block imposes on the full nodes, decreasing the cost to run a node and eventually increasing the number of nodes or at least keeping it at it's current level rather than risk the opposite trend which could be catastrophic. Keep in mind we only have 6300 discoverable nodes today. If we have 3000 nodes next year, it's bad like crossing the streams bad.
Now, I understand that people are really worried about fees, but the point is we have scaling options that don't create this risk of loosing nodes. And we need some fees to control spam, regardless of the blocksize limit. We could enable segwit today and effectively have double the block size to start with and then that enables a bunch of new options for aggregating transactions, all without any need for a hard fork. If the layer two stuff currently on the table is effective, it could get to the point where an average user only needs a few actual bitcoin transactions per year and all of their business is carried out on a network layer above that, which would mean veeery low fees and also more privacy. Now that doesn't mean that we won't have to increase the blocksize limit down the line, but doing it immediately as a knee-jerk reaction to increasing fees, and risking a very contentious ethereum style hardfork, rather than using our entire arsenal of alternatives, which are enabled by segwit, means risking bitcoins main value proposition, censorship resistance predicated on decentralization, perhaps for not much benefit.

@_date: 2016-03-16 17:40:09
Unfortunately I think this comes down to a matter of opinion. I hope I can persuade you to understand my point of view.
In my opinion with Bitcoin decentralization *is the product*. The reason you want Bitcoin is because you believe that the network is outside the control of any single entity. If Bitcoin does not have this property, Bitcoin has much less value. Do larger blocks compromise that decentralization? Sure. To verify a block a node needs to check the signature of every transaction in the block. Even a spam transaction requires this computation and thus larger blocks take more computing power to verify. The current amount is not negligible and future amounts might further decrease the number of verifying nodes.
If there are fewer verifying nodes then Bitcoin is closer to being in the hands of a few entities rather than what we want, for it to be ubiquitous. That's what all this is about.
Since space on a block is not an unlimited resource, it requires computing time and storage, it doesn't make sense that an entity would be able to use that resource without taking on the cost. This is why those of us who know that the full blocks we have observed are the result of spam and not of transactions that would be willing to pay a tiny fee are not worried.
In my opinion, the immediate solution to our scaling issues is to put a price on spam, to implement optimizations like SegWit, to implement layers on top of the blockchain layer that reduce the incentive to record transactions on the blockchain (like lightning network) and finally to grow block size limit at a pace at which consensus can keep up with and which allows Bitcoin verification to remain ubiquitous.

Ah ok. I've made that point as well and I agree it's too low. The way I would express it is to say, I want Moores law to make it so cheap to run a full node that there is one in every device. This expresses it more as a positive it says: We want bitcoin to be as ubiquitous as TCP/IP.

I don't work for Bitfinex, I'm just a customer, but I speak with Phil online often.
They aren't switching to a new provider, their provider is moving facilities and they have been forced to either move or find a new provider. Regardless of what choice they made, they would need to migrate anyway.
I think they try very hard to keep their customers informed, they've been investing a lot in new infrastructure in the past year and it seems to be paying off, but I genuinely think this networking problem has caught them off guard. This is a distributed realtime system they are trying to keep working, it's surprising that it works as well as it does and the fact that the shit has not been breaking during this entire past rally is a testimate to the fact that they are getting better at what they do. Other exchanges likely don't have the problems that bitfinex has precisely because they don't have as much real volume.

In the case of a crypto institution that holds funds the majority of the funds can be held offline. The only part that is vulnerable is the *float*, the working capital they need to make their daily transactions. If that portion is sufficiently small it can be insured or it can be priced into the fees that the company assesses. The offline fund are not at risk to hackers.

GBTC is a small pool of bitcoins held in trust that can be traded like a stock. It's difficult for new bitcoin to get into that pool hence the price is now very high. There are tax advantages to purchasing GBTC but they might not outweigh the current premium you would pay. 
Coinbase is just a user friendly exchange that allows people to buy bitcoin. They charge a fee and try to give you something close to the spot price but it's not the best.
The cheapest way to buy bitcoin would be to get an account on an exchange and patiently place limit orders to try and get a decent price. You could, for example, transfer dollars to Coinbase and fund a USD account on their GDAX exchange. Alternatively, Bitfinex is the largest and most liquid western exchange but generally caters to pros.
If placing orders on an exchange is too complicated for you purchasing directly from Coinbase is probably your best option.
Keep in mind you may be about to "buy the top" if you buy at this price. Emphasis on the word may. No one knows what will happen next, just be prepared to take losses and not capitulate.

Miners aren't pushing big blocks because it's more profit, they are incentivized to get higher fees. They want big blocks because they think it means more users and a higher price. Regarding a controversial change like extending the block rewards, node operators would also need to decide this to fork. Though miners have the power to block certain changes, trying to make such changes themselves without the support of the whole network is a big risk too their income. Such a controversial change would likely result in an Ethereum like fork. Possible but unlikely.

The design of liquid is complete enough that we know it doesn't require segwit or benefit from small blocks. The fact that they are being cautious about rolling it out, just speaks to the professionalism of those developers; a stark contrast to Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum.
Your argument that I would want to lower the size is absurd. I don't support *changing* the consensus rules right now. Blocksize up or blocksize down, especially when there are so many things that reduce the load on the network without changing those rules, both for on-chain and second layer.
During the process of optimizing a system, the last thing you do is increase the resource consumption of the system. If you don't understand this then I submit you do not have the technical understanding to properly gage these questions.
Incidentally none of those optimizations are going to be possible now on Bitcoin Cash which is why Bitcoin Cash is the real cripple coin.

Liquid is already working, does not require segwit and does not benefit from constrained blocks. THIS IS NONSENSE.
The need for second layer solutions *will occur* at *any blocksize limit*. The only difference is that as you increase the blocksize you risk important consequences for the health of the network.

Lightning network is just where the community has coalesced onto the best idea we have to scale bitcoin and keep it decentralized. It's just one part of many solutions that will eventually be needed. What else would you like people to do?
Everyone will be connected to everyone else because it's a p2p network, nodes connect and disconnect to other nodes at will, just like bitcoin. The network itself will be constantly changing shape as new channels open and close. That is a major design goal.
There are plenty of papers, presentations and code that you can use to learn the finer points of how lightning network works and what is left to figure out. 
When I say that it doesn't it exist I mean there is no live implementation with real financial value because bitcoin mainnet needs to adopt segwit before LN will work on it. Altcoins have not implemented it yet either AFAIK. It does exist on bitcoin testnet and is in the process of iterative development.

If bitcoin verification keeps nearly the same cost per block then as internet and storage capacity improves the cost of running a node decreases. That's good because for bitcoin to truly be the value transfer layer of the internet, we need millions of full nodes not thousands. Some increase in the blocksize might still be compatible with this but we should keep pushing the limits of optimization and testing second layer solutions before we start changing a part of the network that we know could harm it. We should do as much as we can with soft forks before we risk a hard fork.

No, I disagree with your premise. Miners don't control everything and there are limits on their power. And as the hardware matures the trend toward centralizing mining power is reversing.
Likewise, developers do not have all of the information when they start a project, that's not how this process works.
Worse than all that you haven't articulated anything you would like to see changed or how such changes could be achieved. Bitcoin isn't going to stop, and it doesn't care about your whining.

A small fee is paid to each link in the chain of a lightning transaction but their operating cost is tiny compared to a miner. If the network is successful the fees will be negligible and in some cases negative. So you have the upfront blockchain fee to put money into a LN channel and then tiny fees for each transaction.

No one can predict how any of these systems will really evolve because they combine technology with human incentives. But we know that we need a solution like lightning network to scale bitcoin regardless of whether or not we use other solutions like adjusting the block size limit.

The number of possible routes goes up exponentially as the average number of connections per node increases. The market will never drive all of the fees to be negative but they are part of the design so that a node can temporarily replenish a channel.
You are right. I am making a lot of assumptions, we don't know how the network will finally shake out. But because I'm assuming that there will be lots of competition and very low costs to operate a node I'm not accepting the FUD about LN.

Jorge, trading volume tells you nothing about how much new money is coming into a market.

Assuming there are multiple routes a transaction can take your wallet would choose the one with the least fees. So competition between nodes is very high and the cost to a node to process a transaction is extremely low. Negative fees are a way for a node to incentivize transactions in the opposite direction on a two way channel.

That's not what negative fees are in this context. The vast majority of fees are not negative. A node could allow a transaction with a large monetary value to pass through at a negative fee so that it can balance the channel and make more fees on small transactions in the other direction rather than allowing the channel to close. The fee strategy is up to the node.

Stocks have a speculation component and an investment component. i.e. the price goes up and down that speculation, the stock pays a dividend it's an investment. Bitcoin only has the speculative component. That's all he's saying, it only pays if later on someone else is willing to pay more.

In your mind maybe. In reality people are pretty split about the future of bitcoin right now. I can think of a lot of public figures from finance that I think we can agree are intelligent and not ideologically motivated that are fairly bullish on bitcoin: Blythe Masters, Bill Miller, Ray Dalio... and others who aren't: Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Dorian Nakamoto. That fact is that nobody knows what is going to happen and it's a fair bet either way. On the one side we might be on the tail end of an elaborate ponzi scheme, on the other hand we might be witnessing the birth of a new kind of currency. What I don't understand about people on is they seem to think they know the future with the exact same certainty as zealots on Mainly you find that their understanding of how it works is pretty limited. The fact is it has been doing what it does for many years and it's likely going to keep on doing what it does, and the longer it does the more likely it is to grow, and some dude on reddit can probably neither help nor hinder that process. Place your bets accordingly.

Fiat conversions would basically be multiple parties offering tokens that are tied to fiat in various bank accounts. If you send those parties fiat via ACH or cash they add more tokens, if you relinquish tokens you can initiate an ACH transfer. In a perfect world there could be large numbers of these parties competing for business by submitting to a reputation system. Abra is somewhat similar to this model, though centralized currently. Tether.to is also similar.

The main thing that is different is just more evidence of a bear trend reversal.

No it's a ponzi. Because reasons man. Reasons and also definitions man. Even Bernard Madoff says bitcoin is a ponzi. What's that you say, he has no credibility... on ponzies he does.
But seriously, asserting that bitcoin is an *asset*, doesn't help people understand since they immediately ask what is backing that asset. *Math*, for example, is not a good answer to that question. I  think it's better to call it an *incentivization token in a decentralized network*. That at least helps to explain why it's so different from other assets.

They are off chain transactions but they are secured by the blockchain, so the worst a third party can do is force you to wait for a channel to timeout to recover your funds. They cannot take your money without a your signature. Think of a channel like a temporary debit card, the money you put in a channel can be spent quickly and in tiny fractions once it is inside.
I believe you pay blockchain transaction fees when you open a channel or to close a channel before it times out.

No. Madoff investments was a black box, people thought they had a portfolio of assets and no such assets existed. Bitcoin is an open ledger, we know that miners must expend huge amounts of energy to mine each block and take the rewards, and we know that every bitcoin transaction was signed by it's owner. When you have the private key to a Bitcoin on the blockchain, you know that you have it. So it's literally the opposite of Madoff investments. 
The price of Bitcoin, is a different story, it could be manipulated, it could be in a bubble, but there are also over 100 Bitcoin exchanges around the world, it would be very hard to control them all.

The programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain are basically limited to just being able to respond to transactions requests. They would not have the power to say, read a miners hard drive. They run in a sandbox, similar to a Javascript program that can't get out of the browser. They also require small amounts of Ether to do things like allocate memory. So for example, I couldn't write a program that fills up someone's whole hard drive because it would cost a billion dollars to do that. 
It think that both a block reward and the ether used in the transactions are given to miners. This recirculates the existing currency and also create some inflation. The rewards work on a similar system to bitcoin except somewhat more inflationary.
I think the idea is that more inflation means that Ether is more of an incentive to mine but not necessarily a unit of account. Once you understand this you might come to the conclusion that Ethereum is good for Bitcoin, since Bitcoin might be the easiest thing to trade with Ethereum applications.
Just think of it. People might actually start using bitcoins... to do... you know... things.

No not exactly. Github is just a service to store source code so that people can collaborate on a large project by checking pieces in and out.
Ethereum is actually running code on a network of computers that anyone can set up. I'd say the best thing to compare it to is a Java Virtual Machine, which allows programs to run in a web browser, except distributed and incentivized. Ether is the internal currency, needed to incentivize the use of resources on the decentralized network.

I agree bitcoin will potentially take a big tumble in about 3 days. It could loose 50% of it's value (150-160 range). The "new normal phase" in the US markets plus the lack of bitcoin adoption will be to blame. I'm not holding any at this time because I understand this risk. But if you think cryptocurrency is about to "go away" because the price is going to drop... then you are truly a retard.

You can't, but why would you use that as a source of information. This fact is also true of any stock or asset, that's why analysts have to disclose their holdings and their families holdings.

Thanks for this post. I share your frustrations. I think you've pointed to the main thing holding back bitcoin at this time. Regulation has essentially made it hard to get, especially in New York. There is not much reason to purchase bitcoin for normal transactions given this situation.
Actually spending bitcoin online is kind of an amazing thing, I much prefer it to credit cards. It's often in the back of my mind with a bank or credit card, how do I know this Point of Sale System isn't compromised, and indeed my card details have been stolen and used once, actually to buy Metrocards and pay Time Warner ;). The bank will reimburse you, but who even wants to go through that process. So it's interesting to note that I wish I could spend bitcoins in more places. If I could do all of my daily expenses with bitcoin I would, because I like it better. I think most people focus on the price speculation aspect of the currency, but I think the experience is better, I'd like that experience to be my future. I'm uncertain if it will be.

Ether's main purpose is not to be a currency bub. Long term value storage is not part of it's design. It's purpose is to incentivize consensus based processing for apps that don't necessarily have to do with currency or value storage in Ether. It's not going to replace bitcoin, but it will create an infrastructure that might actually allow cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to enter niches that they have so far failed to enter.
Like for example remember that moment where the price of bitcoin dropped because some drug dealers exit scammed their dark market. That happened because there was no way to easily build decentralized escrow on bitcoin. Ethereum can do that easily, and allow that escrow to be counted in bitcoin. So betting on Ethereum *is* betting on bitcoin.

It's like bitcoin except instead of just storing amounts of bitcoin on the ledger, the ledger stores mini programs. These programs have their own memory and instructions and can do anything that a normal program can do except that they happen on the blockchain, so the program can be trusted to have the output that it's code prescribes and yet run on a decentralized network.
They refer to the programs as Contracts but the name perhaps makes things harder to understand.
In order to prevent the programs from using infinite resources, like an infinite loop, each step that the program takes must be incentivized by a tiny amount of Ether which is then earned by miners.
So an ethereum contract is like a bitcoin transaction except, it's behavior is only limited by the resources it consumes and it's funding.
Is that helpful?

First asset values in the US will fall precipitously, causing the value of the dollar to increase rapidly and grinding money velocity to a halt. With interest rates already near zero the FED will be forced to restimulate with more QE but will overcompensate hurting trust in the dollar as a reserve currency. Nation states and bond holders will race to dump dollar denominated assets. SDR will become official reserve currency.

That would only be true if the price did not rise to compensate. If the price doubled before the halfing then mining profits would be the same. We've already seen several halfings of the price of BTC relative to electricity and hardware, and mining continues.

I'm sorry your understanding is incorrect. The definition of a soft fork is that existing nodes continue to operate and connect to the network as normal.

Segwit is something that we should all be able to agree on. It's very low risk with lots of benefits. It's already working well on many alt-coins. We have developers waiting to enable their new work on top of Segwit that are using Litecoin to test it instead. Why are you conflating that with a 2MB hardfork? They are only related in the minds of people who are looking for any way to force the hand of the bitcoin community.
Likewise miners are not the oligarchic rulers of bitcoin. Bitcoin is ruled by consensus and should choose the best ideas from the smartest people, not bow to some miner pointing to their sunk costs.
Nothing in Segwit prevents a hard fork to 2MB blocks, but it is a less controversial way to help with our immediate problems and opens up a lot of new long term innovation that is literally stalled without it.

I wish had it's own version of the snapshillbot. This one would go right on there. You are basically making the argument that price is so high because demand is decreasing. You're on a higher plane of delusion my friend. Evidence has no place in your lexicon.
A much simpler explanation is that while bitcoin has not proven useful for transactions that can already be done with credit cards, it has proven useful for transactions that can't. So the darknet markets and the use of bitcoin for gambling collateral has grown steadily and that alone can easily account for the rising price floor and the rise in transactions that actually carry a fee. (edit: Hodlers don't make fee bearing transactions.)
You may not like it but it appears that's what is actually happening.

Most wallets calculate fees for the user and in fact you would need to go into the preferences and disable limits to create a transaction with such a high fee amount. Likewise personal maintenance of keys is difficult no doubt. You don't maintain the stripe on your credit card yourself either and that's why services like Coinbase exist.

That's possible. I think there are mitigating factors you aren't considering though that may prevent centralization. As far as the speed limit.

It's no secret that a small minority of people control a huge percentage of hashing power while a large number of people validate blocks. Unfortunately we're in the situation where the desires of that small number of people who have majority hashing power are in conflict with the majority of users who validate blocks. So they've decided to stop validating blocks that don't support the improvements they want starting in August. I guess you can argue with my statement that the vast majority of users who validate want Segwit but every metric we have from polls, to signalling, to node type surveys points to this overwhelmingly.

It's not that I'm not responding it's that I don't agree with your premise, which is, as far as I can tell, that for bitcoin to be successful everyone who uses it needs to HODL. And if people are "just using it" that somehow means its not growing. If no-one held bitcoin but a large amount of transactions were using bitcoin as a remittance method, the tokens themselves would still hold some value, as the velocity of money in the system would not be infinite.
My point about Steam is not that they are HODLing, it's that they are recognizing that teenagers are using bitcoin to get around the limitations that kids have regarding using their own money online.

Palates of dollars fit nicely on airplanes. My point is it's a misnomer to say that something is backed by another asset if it's not redeemable.

Most incidence of fraud or theft with credit cards happen when the credit card number is stolen. In a credit card transaction you are essentially handing over your private key for every transaction. This is changing now with chipped cards, but the reason is of course, to reduce chargebacks due to fraud and theft. But you've made my point for me really, that most chargebacks are due to fraud and theft and not actually arbitration between customer and merchant.
With bitcoin you would need to take possession of a private key, which can be password protected, in order to commit theft. That will definitely happen through physical theft and hacking, but it's a much higher level crime, and will thus be more rare. The public needs to understand that bitcoins are like cash and they will act accordingly.

You understand that it's only morons and trolls who think that getting everyone to hold onto their bitcoins is how bitcoin will be successful and increase in value. 
Real success for bitcoin comes from increased utility and increased liquidity. Both of which are helped by Valve and other companies adding bitcoin payments regardless of whether they eventually hold revenue in bitcoin, fiat, beany babies or magic the gathering cards.

I'm not in favor of drugs at all, and actually I'm going through a lot of difficulty with a loved one currently regarding their cocaine use. But, I wouldn't want that person's drug problem to lead to legal problems which would undoubtably increase their need to self medicate. I think drug addiction is a health problem and as such the government solution to the problem should be to make health care, education and facilities available to help drug addicts recover. Policies that make drug production and distribution unprofitable would be helpful but current policies do the opposite. So regarding dark net markets, I think they are a reaction to a failed policy and they at least give users some degree of consumer protection and prevent them from coming into direct contact with drug dealers who may be involved in other crimes. The fact that bitcoin makes it possible to do this does not bother me at all. 
Krokodil is not likely to come into the American market, we already have Meth and Lean. The main difficulty in moving Plutonium is not likely to be the payment method, and bitcoin would probably be a poor choice. Monero would be better if the market cap would just increase.
I actually made a point of not telling the kids in my family about bitcoin as I'm not a bitcoin evangelist. Though some in our family have set aside some bitcoins for them as we have done with stocks and bonds. They asked me about it and I discovered that they had obtained some from a friend at a boarding school which I believe they store in web based wallets.

Jesus this argument again. No one said Steam was becoming a hodler. As I've already pointed out, no intelligent company executive would take on the risk of holding company revenue in bitcoin. But if they are offering bitcoin payments it means that they think someone on one end of the transaction has bitcoin, even if just long enough to make a purchase. They have information about their customers and do not likely make decisions based on a whim so my guess is that they offered bitcoins payments because it's useful for some percentage of their customers. It's really hard to look at that fact and not see evidence of some growth in the bitcoin ecosystem but I've come to see that the anti-bitcoin crowd will grasp at any straw to convince themselves that itsnothappening.gif 
Likewise Coinbase is not the only way to obtain bitcoins. And coinbase is not needed to hold bitcoins. If teenagers can get their hands on pot and beer they can get bitcoins.

Your the one creating a strawman and bringing up shit that is irrelevant. All I've said is the reason I think Steam added bitcoin is because they think kids who want games have bitcoin. It's pretty simple and straight forward. A child who has access to a computer or phone can have a bitcoin wallet and make bitcoin transactions without the permission of adults. It doesn't matter that alternatives exist and that some parents give their kids bank cards. It doesn't matter what Steam does with the bitcoins. Of course they use a payment processor. Of course they don't hold bitcoins. They aren't morons and they don't want to loose their jobs.

If the Zimbabwe dollar was actually backed by the US dollar they would presumably need to be redeemable for actual US Dollars. In which case why would you prefer a Zimbabwe dollar to an actual US Dollar, you would just redeem it immediately, it's not any more portable or easier to verify it's authenticity.
So it's pretty easy to see that this Zimbabwe dollar is just another attempt by an inept government to inspire confidence in a currency they are creating either by complete falsehood or some sort of fractional reserve scheme.
I hope you can see then why bitcoin is not a "solution" to this problem. Just as Sergei Mavrodi recently discovered: If your problem is how to keep your scam going, bitcoin doesn't actually help.

Credit card numbers are not primarily stolen from individual users computers. They are stolen from the databases of vendors. The whole purpose of bitcoin is to do business without the vendors creating an additional risk to the users by holding their private keys.
I think we are coming from a different place. The purpose of bitcoin is to get around barriers created by governments and large corporations. It is not to emulate the behavior of credit cards. If people want to use it to buy Alpaca socks, good for them. That's not super relevant to the purpose and primary markets of bitcoin. A kid getting around being unable to get a bank account is.
Likewise if you want the chargeback behavior of credit cards with bitcoin, you will never get that from the protocol. You will get that from a third party, today.

So drug dealers mainly launder money back to south america buy purchasing high value high demand commodities in the United States with cash and exporting them back via legitimate businesses or by shipping cash by the same means that they ship drugs. This includes, metals, tractor parts automobiles and whatever their latest idea is. AML\KYC regulations do zero to curtail actual money laundering, they create a huge cost to law abiding citizens and contribute greatly to the centralization of financial services. They are a wonderful example of regulation capture.
So far we have no evidence that bitcoin is being used to launder money and we have really good evidence that it is not, mainly the market cap is not large enough to facilitate that. So instead of trying to hold back bitcoin because you are afraid of it being used to launder money consider evaluating the effectiveness of existing money laundering regulations versus their cost to society.

If you look at all the possible use cases, very few actually need chargebacks. Any point of sale transaction or pay as you go transaction does not need it. Otherwise charge backs are already replaced by third parties in 2 of 3 multisig transactions. Basically if you want that extra protection you'll just pay for it.

I don't think that technical upgrades to bitcoin have a lot to do with current adoption. Bitcoin in it's current form is fine for online purchases and if you are using a modern wallet you aren't experiencing lag times greater than one confirmation.
All those upgrades will be big and will lead to new use cases for sure. But there is still the issue of competing with currencies that people are already holding, and I believe that that issue is only helped by more places to obtain bitcoins, and more places to spend them. 
Likewise all of the bitcoin visa cards like Shift are extremely expensive compared to just the fees on a Bitpay transaction. Until there is more competition in that market they will not be a viable option.

EMH might be helpful for understanding markets like cotton futures where the only information is basically supply and demand but it doesn't help with inefficient markets like tech stocks. I've been able to buy the bottom too many times in my life to believe that. EMH doesn't account for the fact that most investors are either not paying attention, not emotionally equipped to buy low and sell high and most importantly reacting based on false premises. It does not account for bubbles.

One main issue is not the principle of the debt, but the source of the interest. If debt is the source of all currency then the total debt + interest is always greater than the total supply of currency. That's one of the reasons why it's regarded as unsustainable.

As far a bitcoin goes, keep in mind the goal of a speculator who is trying to find a bottom is to find something that has value but a large number of people wrongly believe it has less value. Sometimes, this is because the speculator has special information but more often it's because they see past emotional responses and can recognize groupthink.
So after being initially very interested in bitcoin around the time Slashdot reported it had reached parity with the dollar I basically ignored it until 2015 mainly because I wasn't willing to wire money to Japan. Once I noticed it had been cratering from it's all time high wanted to know why people were not valuing it. I expected at that point that it was going to go all the way to the potato even though Bitcoin still made a lot of sense to me as a programmer. I didn't understand why people were shitting all over it. I have some insight into how iterative development works so as I looked into it, I could see how peoples unreasonable expectations were fueling the FUD and that most of the problems are probably solvable. That would be my special knowledge. Because I've built other things I know that solutions will usually arise even if it there isn't even a proposal yet just because people are thinking about it. That's how problem solvers work. They stare at clouds in their brains until they form into solutions. Anyone who says something is impossible because they can't immediately see the solution does know where solutions come from. So taking all of that into account there was a narrative for bitcoin being undervalued by people who lack an understanding of the method by which it will evolve and improve. A few other factors, like continued investment in infrastructure made me think it was a buying opportunity. I was not certain of the bottom at that point but I'm willing to go underwater if I think I'm long-term-correct. $220-230 just looked like a double bottom, it also looked like resistance became support from the previous bubble, that's all, just a change in the character of the market basically, so I guess that part is probably luck. I can't tell you how much I wanted to sell when it dropped below 200. I left my laptop in my office for two days.
 
Incidentally Ethereum is an interesting counterpoint to this, because as you've pointed out there may be problems that don't have solutions, no matter how hard you think about them, and proof of stake might be one of these problems where the answer always seems to be around the corner but the solution always dissolves into perpetual motion. Aside from proof of stake though you can expect Ethereum to evolve significantly in ways we aren't expecting and even bear fruits that no one is currently proposing it will bear. That's why despite my recent desire to dump the rest of my Ether I decided to sit on my hands and just let 4 or 5 years go by. It's humility basically and a touch of fuck it.

I just think there are times when you need to take profit instead of blindly allowing your risks to increase. I almost tripled my money in the stock market after I bought in big in 2009 but I've now sold almost all of it. I will eat the lack of gains for a year or two rather than sustain the risk of HODLing through a bear market. That's really the only place where I disagree with you guys. You don't seem to acknowledge that the S&amp;P500 seems to reflect that the stock market as a whole is being used more for pure speculation and as a container for value rather than for investment based on earnings. The historic P/E charts show that very clearly.
Right now dollars are not a bad thing to hold, precious metals also do not seem bad. Bitcoin is obviously going well, so far, if you were accumulating in 2015. But this is not a life long commitment for me, it's just the result of paying attention and attempting to manage risk.

Currently the markets using bitcoins consistently are dark net markets (drugs), gambling websites and prostitution. All of those are getting around either government controls or credit card controls. So the main use case for bitcoin is still regulatory arbitrage. Obviously we'd all like to see that change.
Regarding kids disobeying there parents with bitcoin, I'm not saying it's a good thing, I'm not saying it's a mass phenomenon, I just think that it's important to understand that it may be happening and when kids figure something out it tends to spread.
@_date: 2016-07-12 00:50:56
No one can perfectly time markets, especially in short timeframes it's nearly impossible and essentially gambling, but over longer timeframes it becomes somewhat easier. It's essentially like poker, there is luck involved but knowledge and emotional fortitude also affect the outcome.
When bitcoin hit $160 in early 2015, I started looking into it again and trying to understand why people weren't valuing it and whether I thought it had value. Over a month or so I sat out one bubble and until I got the notion that the bottom was around $230. I had to convince myself that demand was not going away and that the technology and infrastructure were improving and then I started accumulating. I don't think that was all luck, I was worried I could be wrong but I spent a whole year expecting what has happened to happen.

**Fucking TIPS will go to zero!!!!**
I kid.
Though I think the way in which fiat money is created is a bit unsettling once you fully understand it, I disagree with Alex on most of his points. Most people know that inflation exists and understand that inflation is supposed to give people an incentive to invest rather than horde cash. Normal inflation itself is not really a problem, if the system continues to function normally, you can think of inflation as the price of holding money. So I primarily agree with and However, the problems seem to come when things stops functioning normally, and each time this happens it seems more and more likely that debt based money is not sustainable or at least that bad monetary policy exacerbates the difficulties of normal economic cycles. It does this by distorting the way that we price risk. A lack of price discovery for risk, as we know from the housing crisis, fuels bubbles. Instead if the money supply had occasional contractions, creditors and speculators would price risk accordingly. The analogy I would use is forest fire prevention, if the forest floor never burns it accumulates more and more leaves and sticks, making the eventual fire much larger. In the case of the economy the leaves and sticks would be leveraged speculation and institutions that rely on consistent yield from speculative markets to cover their obligations.
It's also important to keep in mind that our sample size for most asset values is on the order of 50 years. There are many non-libertarians who believe from historical study that there is a larger debt cycle with a period of 75-100 years and that a "100 year credit contraction" would have a devastating impact on the economy and all asset values for whom availability of credit is the major driver of price. Of course no-one knows when that would happen or even what it looks like. It's hard for me to tell if that contraction already happened 8 years ago, if it will never happen or if it was not allowed to happen. I'm not convinced either way but I spend a lot of time trying to understand.
So, keeping an open mind, it seems to me that if you look today at the combination of stock price to earnings ratios, at relative commodity prices, at industrial productivity, at bond yields, and at the period of the business cycle for the past 30 years, the situation today seems definitely uncommon... if not unprecedented. It's hard for me to look at that situation and not see that it could easily be *a shit ton of sticks and leaves on the forest floor*. 
In closing, I pray to lord Satoshi that Chris and Josh should spend some time looking into this before they blindly shill more grandmothers into price insensitive S&amp;P500 index fund HODLing :)

This is what we are talking about actually. Let me break them down for you:
+ There are no examples of Ethereum contracts being secure at scale.
+ There are examples of catastrophic failures that are unfixable in flight without forking the network.
+ Even simple token contracts have apparently been [loosing and trapping money.](
+ There are no examples of ordinary users creating demand for DAPP tokens. That entire business model is unproven at any scale. More importantly there is no evidence that this potential demand justifies the current valuations of the tokens.
+ There are no examples of DAPPs attracting ordinary users or outcompeting their centralized competitors. Just in gas costs they present users with an upfront onboarding cost that traditional apps don't.
+ There are regulatory questions about tokens. They appear to be securities based on the Howey test. Their developers are involved in the creation so this represents an important point of failure for, it seems, every one of them.
+ The SEC has not given guidance on Ether, and based on how they raised capital it appears to also pass the Howey test. Remember Satoshi never sold Bitcoins he mined them and let other people sell them. Under the law that is actually how the distinction is made. With a large number of American investors in the ETH crowdsale there is clear jurisdiction.
+ Many of the ICOs do not seem to have a minimum viable product. Based on the history of the dot com bubble, there was a direct relationship between the amount of bootstrapping and the success of the company. There is literally no bootstrapping in many cases here and [people screaming to the heaven that things won't work to no avail.](
+ The value of Ether has increased something like 60x in just a few months. The chart is unbelievable. That's unprecedented I think, even for Bitcoin's early days. Why wouldn't there be a correction after such a rise?
+ There does not seem to be a base of what I'd call users, i.e. non technical people who need Ether or Ethereum based tokens on a daily basis. In other words no one needs the Ether or tokens they are holding.
+ Vlad Zamfir recently estimated that sharding is 2 years away. 
+ POS alone only gives you basically half the block time but doesn't necessarily translate to more transactions. This is setting aside important unanswered security and economic questions about POS.
+ There appears to be no clear method of scaling the contracts on chain and it's clear that at it's current capacity the blockchain could not support all of the activity of all of the DAPPs which have had token sales. We recently saw a major slow down just to supply the demand for one big crowdsale.
+ It's unclear how arbitrary code execution effects scaling in a high demand situation. Basically we don't have a cost model for DAPPs and it seems clear that every DAPP running simultaneously affects the economic viability of every DAPP.
+ Raiden is as yet unproven and no one appears to be developing specifically with it's potential code execution limitations in mind.
+ There are estimates that the Ethereum blockchain will reach 1TB this year. Expensive SSDs currently max out at 4TB.
+ The network is currently costing almost double that of bitcoin for miners to secure.

I'm not making a value judgement about the purpose of the transactions. If you don't like bitcoin because you think that criminals use it, that is your prerogative. I'm just pointing out that increased usage is the best explanation. If you want to get lost in your own clear idealogical bent such that you aren't seeing reality, that's up to you. On your list of bad things you wont stand for, be sure to also include prostitution, as that is also clearly an actual bitcoin use case.
I would also mention the recent addition of bitcoin to Steam as another piece of actual evidence. It is likely rooted in market research not some random whim and my guess is that they may have noticed bitcoins are easier for teenagers to obtain than credit cards in some cases.
