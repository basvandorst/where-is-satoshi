Yeah. Exchanges are where you go to sell bitcoins. I wasn't using it as a wallet.

I'd post the chat log, but everyone would claim it is fake.

Thanks for the choice. I thought I already made it clear. I've seen others posts logs and get torn apart. No thanks.
OK. I also allege that I hold a lot of bitcoin. Am I obligated to sign the addresses to prove it? I also was born in Arizona. Am I obligated to show you my birth certificate? I only have the short form. I'll reference what I want, when I want, which obligates me to jack-squat.
Either believe it or don't. I'm just some random guy on the internet. Consequently, I'll probably be quoted in the Economist tomorrow.

More Ad Hominem. OK, I am officially bored.

BTW - Coinbase and all the big boys have Chainalysis on their payroll. FACT. Ask them.

I moved 120 coins from cold storage. Sold 30. Had a limit order for 90 more and *poof*. Hacker came and snatched my coins. Or someone did. All I know is they moved on 8-2. Small portion of my stash but still I am not happy.

Nice inducement attempt. Ad Hominem attacks ain't exactly the way to warm me up.
@_date: 2016-08-09 03:54:34
Just wait. You heard it here first.

And... Software is never done. Only good enough.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:08:16
Yeah this is a common misconception. +1

Hard to invest in a coin with a 12MM premine and no cap.
