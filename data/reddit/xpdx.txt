The problem is that the wires buried under the ground and the airwaves are "owned" by private corporations. As if anyone can own an airwave. The only way we can have a "peoples internet" is to figure out how to use "publicly owned" airwaves to create a solid mesh network. Sadly this is still pretty far away but we are getting closer every day. I can't wait to charge google to peer with the "peoples internet" - or just go back to using the old internet that nobody is using.

I think you have the right to publish whatever you want on your own website. I also think (someone correct me if I'm wrong) that reddit can pick and choose what it wants on it's own website.

The phone companies have slowly eliminated dry pairs from the law as well. It used to be that you could buy a pair of copper wires from one house to another house. It cost like 50 cents a month, like it should.  Once they realized we could run whatever we wanted over those copper pairs they've worked tirelessly to make it impossible to get those dry pairs installed anywhere.

It seems like they could have pivoted to software development or any number of other hardware projects. Hell, cheap solar powered mining boxes or cheap integrated hardware wallets would be better than what they appear to be doing now. Developing software that could help companies and people use bitcoin securely and easily would also be better imho. 
It is disturbing that it appears that would stick to a plan that is just not feasible anymore. It doesn't bode well for the future of the company. Of course it's always possible they are just smarter than everyone else and they have some ace up their sleeve that we just don't know about yet.  (For example the chips cost $.01 each, use 1 watt and have a 16 Terrahash rate) 
If that isn't the case tho it seems that if faced with no viable business plan it would be wiser to return the money to the VCs and move on to something else. There might be lawsuits but not as many and not as big as if they burned $110M on a plan that just isn't feasible from the very beginning.

Yea that's what I figured. I made a half hearted attempt to figure out where the encrypted hash is actually stored. Assuming he used Adobe signing, from the Wikipedia page it seems like maybe they get a hash of the document and then encrypt that hash w private key and then append the result to the file. There is an indicator that tells how many bytes in to the file the document goes. That's how far I got before I got distracted by something shiny. I was going to open up the file with a raw text editor and see what was in there... Maybe today sometime.

Yea.. It's not surprising actually. Moderating an active subreddit requires a lot of work to keep it sane. Sometimes you have to make hard and fast rules that you follow without reviewing every single case in detail because you simply wouldn't have time. It's not fair but at least it's consistent. 
Or maybe the moderator is just a dick. That happens sometimes on the internets.

Weird. I hope they have something up their sleeve that will make this worthwhile. If they succeed in getting these mining chips in all kinds of devices it's good for the bitcoin ecosystem I guess. I just don't see how they are going to get there and how they are going to make money.

Does anybody know what the main communication mechanism for large pools and large miners and the core dev team is? Have they taken the temperature of the big miners/pools? It seems like everyone is anticipating a big problem from somewhere. I'm just wondering if this is actually known for a fact or if folks are worrying about a problem that hasn't been confirmed. It seems like if the core dev team could get a commitment from a few of the larger pools/miners that the rest of the community would fall in... I mean in theory all the miners and pools want bitcoin to do well.

This is very interesting but it makes alarm bells go off in my head. Who are these people? Can I trust them? What if something goes wrong, do investors have any recourse? Would I have to travel to the Marshall Islands if I wanted to sue? 
Traditionally this sort of investment scheme is restricted to "Accredited Investors" who are supposed to know what they are getting into. The small buy in amount makes me think they are targeting  less sophisticated investors. 
Not to say it's a scam, just that I would hope anyone investing would ask lots of questions and be very satisfied with the answers  before buying in.

Who says they aren't? If I was rich and had a mind to start accumulating bitcoin I would have a few bots constantly buying small amounts on different exchanges. I would want to avoid drawing attention to myself for lots of reasons which you can probably imagine.
Selling would likely be done in much the same way to avoid a huge drop in price.

You can't control a protocol. It's a protocol. Its written in to the code. The code doesn't give a shit about laws of rules or backbone providers. And it's open source so the people who think they own the internet really don't, all they own are some wires buried in the dirt.. that's it- that IS NOT the internet.  We can set up our own internet anytime we want. I can do one today in a few hours- it would be small mind you, but if others joined it could grow. 
That's how the internet started.

Has it really been confirmed that this is 21's business plan or is it just a rumor? It seems like non-starter IMHO. I would think (hope) that the 21 guys are smart enough to do some basic back of the envelope calculations.

@_date: 2016-01-14 14:27:22
I do not have a complete enough understanding to know what the consequences of increasing the block size limit (or not) would be. I do know that I hate censorship and that in my experience the people censoring have some motive that I won't like. I think there are a lot of people like me. Censoring opinions that you disagree with even if they have less merit than your position doesn't ingratiate people to you. This is why I support Gavin and his escapades, not because I have some great technical understanding of the issue. It's a shame really- because maybe smaller blocks would be better, but I don't want Bitcoin to be ruled by people who are willing to use their position to silence disagreement through censorship. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 04:48:18
I hope so, I really do. It would be a shame if one of the biggest of this new wave of legitimized bitcoin companies crashed and burned. From some of the other articles out their it appears they are betting not only that they can corner the market on embedded mining chips but that there will be a real use for them (the chips)  and that bitcoin's value as a currency will go way way up.  That's a big bet.

How on earth would a new rule be implemented without wide economic demand for it? Most people have to run the new code to make it happen, nobody can force you (or anyone else) to run the new code.

Fair point. There are influential people other than core devs in the bitcoin world and a handful of them clearly have an agenda and are willing to use what influence and power they have to silence people they disagree with. It's not clear to me how they are all related but generally if they use those tactics to get their way they are bad for bitcoin imho. If they are not going to allow free debate I can't accept their ideas. Maybe I'm missing something- if so please fill me in.

Anyone can write a C+D. It's basically just asking in writing to knock it off. There is no legal requirement to follow a C+D. It's just meant to act as a warning so everyone can avoid court if at all possible. If you are reporting the truth there is no need to comply with such a request. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 08:44:03
Flamingboard is right. It's just a formal, standard way of doing it that has lots of case law behind it and is recognized by the courts. Once you do get to court you don't have to waste a bunch of time trying to determine if you asked them to stop or not. The C+D is accepted without a lot of fuss, a text message would cause all sorts of trouble and leaves room for misunderstandings and grey areas.

All this craziness with the price and mining and so forth is part of the plan, but it's only the first step. The whole thing is kind of pre-ordained, precoded- it's a grand experiment- no guarantee it will work, but golly it sure seems like it might...

I am not a tax expert so don't take my advice as gospel, but, I don't think you have to pay taxes on bitcoin gains until you trade them for fiat. In other words; your profit is only the number of $ above any initial $ "investment" you made when you trade the coins in for $.

You don't really need a video. Although I bet you could find one on youtube. 
Just a few things:
* Price of bitcoin does not directly effect the electricity costs for miners. 
* Bitcoin mining maintains the network, miners are paid for their efforts through block rewards, if there are more miners they each have less of a chance of getting a block reward (you can think of block rewards as random) 
* The Bitcoin network could be maintained for much much less than what is currently being spent. An arms race in the mining field has ballooned the cost of mining. 
Any clearer? 
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:13:58
Actually I think I might be understanding what you are saying now... 
You are concerned about the wastefulness of all the electricity being used to maintain the network?
Keeping mind that the reward halves every four years or so till the point where there will be barely any reward for miners. There will always be some reward and there will always be transactions fees. This (in theory) will reduce the ammount of people mining and reduce the electricity usage as well. 
Also I hope that solar power and computing power will be so advanced by 2024 that I could run the whole network on my solar powered laptop... 
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:04:59
I think you've made an association that you shouldn't have but I'm not sure what it is. The bitcoin protocol and the philosophy behind it is very remarkable, I was astounded when I first started understanding it (not that I do completely). I am not the smartest guy but I think it's a beautiful design, Satoshi seems to have thought of everything. 
* Price in dollars (or any fiat) and hash rate are not an any way related to each other.
