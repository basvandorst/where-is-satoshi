I thought of that I was informed when it’s formatted you get a black screen which is not reversible even the Apple technicians said so. It’s definitely gone now. I’ve tried many things to get in but it’s looking hard. Such as all new apple products having a simple 3x-3x-3x-3x password generate function. I thought it would be crackable to then find out it would take over a hundred years to get in

Bud it was a matter of setting up my new iMac then thinking what do I do first. I’m going to open a new wallet and encrypt my IMac wallet. My office is in a secured office residence so it never even came to my head. I can’t believe I made this mistake but I did. I had no iCloud if I did keychain would have the password

If you read my post then you would understand I already did dumb shit. My offline wallet fucked up on me after recovering it I quickly transferred to an online wallet

I had purchased a new 27 inch iMac for our new office. I later got so much negative feedback about how it was just too big for my desk and that a MacBook would be better.
Anyway after completing my new office I decided to go on holiday for a week which was fun but had this bad feeling I don’t know why.
I got back to my office and decided I would take a trip to London as there was a super car conference (I’m into cars). I then decided to go clothes shopping as clothes are a lot cheaper in my home country. I decided going to the fancy mall near by. I then bumped into the Apple store I bought my iMac from and asked an employee if I could swap it they said no. I’d have to return it first. I thought it would be late now because it had been a while. We looked it up and it was the 14th day of purchase, the employee told me I had 4 hours to return it so I quickly ran home and brought the iMac back.
My wallet was newly transferred onto a Blockchain wallet created on the iMac after I had an incident with an offline wallet and got scared. I used auto generate password by apple with no iCloud to backup the keychain. When creating it i took a screenshot on the iMac of the recovery phrase which is also now gone.
I realized at night and called Apple all over the world to try and find somebody that could help. I went to the store 2 hours before it opened Incase there was a delivery van taking the products back to China which is the procedure I was informed by the employee on the phone. The Apple store finally opened, the manager went to check and informed me it was formatted as it’s the standard return- refund procedure.

Or you can always provide the information they’re requesting. Make sure you read their TOS/ policies before mentioning Bitcoin to them. This is why you should not use stupid methods to cash out. I mean worst comes to worst. Photoshop a receipt

I do not remember at all I do remember it was auto generated by Apple and all auto generate is 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 unless made more secure on settings which I didn’t the 4 characters in it are - after every 3 characters meaning it’s 12 random letters no words, unless a 3 letter which I doubt.

Hi, you seem like you may know. I was wondering new new iMacs that doesn’t have keychain/ iCloud synced does the MAC OS still recover passwords? Or does iCloud need to be connected. Thanks
