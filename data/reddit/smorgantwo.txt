The Airbitz bitcoin directory helped me find an obscure (in terms of its location) Mexican restaurant in Oceanside CA that accepts bitcoin.  Funny thing was the google map was wrong and the Airbitz listing map was correct and got me to the restaurant ...good stuff.

Funny, a grad student interviewed me the other day as she was doing her thesis on BTC about regulation.  I said it was unnecessary and after the audible gasp on the other end I told her the following, off the top of my head, but lets face it that is what going on up there:  1.  Regulation is necessary if it is designed to prevent something bad that may happen as a result of using the product/service: i.e. food poisoning, consumer fraud etc.  2.  Regulation needs to be enforced if it is to help anyone.  3.  If regulations are not enforced why have them in the first place.  4.  If regulations are not enforced, as is the majority of the those in the USA, then what it is for  4a.  Window dressing   4b.  Protection Racket.  5. If it is for window dressing and not enforced then again why waste the time on regulation  6.  If it is enforced but only on those who do not have the financial wherewithal to get away with breaking said regulations, it is by definition a Protection Racket.  
I say F**K NY, it has outlived it usefulness as a financial center.  And I really think, those who do business in NY should just say OK, we really don't need you anyhow, sorry the relationship didn't work out and move the operations offshore, thats what current dark pools do anyhow.  Unfortunately, you will have the current Wall Street crowd looking for new orphans and widows to rape and this BTC thing is just the right scape goat to do it; so when and or if it blows up, they can just say, oh that BTC thing was a scam, how were we suppose to know, "we followed all the Regulations"...now the Protection Racket works as insurance policy as well, good game if you can afford it.  All the while  lobbying dollars get spent on stupid, dotting, dip*hit politicians, who allowed the lobbyist to draft the regulations they are being paid to pass in the first place.  Hence follow the dollars and lets see if the proposed "regulation" is for consumer protection or just a Protection Racket.  Unfortunately, even for those that are not cynics already know the answer.
