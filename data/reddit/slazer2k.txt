Neither, its for a Statistic test and brute-force the key as far as i am aware that's not possible and if why not use a aboneded old wallet with thousands of coins in it. as i see it the risk you have the transaction fee if i don't stand by my word to pay for it worst case and best case you get some money 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:03:20
i hate those generalized statistics its very misleading .... they are so many variables like pool mine, fees, used machine etc 
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:44:33
So again i dont want or need any access to the wallet AT all you stay in control of it all the time 
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:42:24
of course not that would be insane no need for any control of the wallet only requirement is you open a new wallet put ten btc in there and leave them tops three months so there is no risk whats so ever and no access from my side at any point in time 
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:42:35
the bitcoin bubble was about to bust like a thousand times by now ... every time it goes up you heard that story again... 
Anyway just be sensible. Only invest money you can afford to lose. That advice goes for ALL investments not only bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:31:14
well its not to ID them thats pretty much useless but. As much as i am a fan of anonymity with exchanges more and more have the requirement to ID at some point in time it could scammer block from exchange to real money or at least make it harder. So lets say if a addresses are on that list or have received money from that address (scammer wants to cash out) the scammer in that example has to prove where his funds come from. so a miner or investor will have no trouble doing that. dont get me wrong the idea is just in the beginning but this could be the way to take the silk road image away at least a bit maybe? 
as for the just put someone on there you dont like well a that person must know your BTC address so normally you would have business of some sort or other with him or her and if wrongly accused this can be managed 
just brain storming here :)

Not a movie but the tv series continuum (sifi) uses btc

Will drop to nothing however when and if Roger Ver gets caught let’s say from maybe a SEC for whatever money fraud or FBI for money laundering (not that I know anything to be clear here) but if hypothetically something like that happens I can see the the headline “bitcoin ceo” arrested for fraud etc and the average Joe would see it as confirmation the BTC and all crypto is fraud etc they don’t isolate Bcash as fork etc so it can damage BTC and other crypto that would hurt my soul 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:39:16
Create a interactive power-point in my study linking to that Wallet on block-chain and my excel sheets and calculations are based on 10 BTC  for that case study. Nothing to crazy but thats why it is important for me to have the wallet with that number i you can check my comment history i asked some time ago when i started this to find a wallet with that amount but i was only able to find abanded ones with 100 BTC upwards which would produce crazy amounts of $
Hey if someones knows a 10 BTC wallet without movement i instant transfer 100$ in BTC to him or her 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:13:28
And where do you see the scam? What can happen to your BTC? What do i get i work on a study and what do i have to gain? Reputation and Career improvement thats worth 1k to me. But as said i dont ask for money i think i am very specific what i pay for and as long i overlooked something there is literary no risk for the other party if you don't agree please point out what a risk would be for the participant. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:18:21
Opportunity from within the company I work for I stepped forward and I see an opportunity to personally gain in regards to my career. The participant will get a copy of my work afterward as long as agreed not to share them public 
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:17:54
Natural selection cant wait to see that shitcoin go 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:09:47


you get the money as reimbursement for your time to open a wallet and not to access it while the study is run 
the result will be given in April but not published the participant receives a copy 
edit typo

I apologies I could swear I saw BCH and not BCC but the original picture is already deleted so I cant recheck. 
If it was not BCH then my post is still relevant in general but not to this thread sorry for that 
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:21:08
which is not the case but yes its reddit so i cant prove it of course. And yes its easy money for the one which agrees to help out with this request whit no risk involved for him or her  
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:08:37
Thanks for helping me out with this Study very much appreciated looks like its arranged. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:48:31
you open one where ever you like i honestly dont care and leave the 10 btc in there for 3 months thats it so you basically get a grand to not touch that wallet perfect for a hodler to make some mooney on the side and no risk involved if you see any please speak up 
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:53:30
as said nope only obligation is not to touch it for three months and reimbursement is 1k for that, no access needed and also i do not want that
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:45:38
My study was based on ten BTC it seems to be a reasonable amount 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:17:34
Well if the dealer sold it to me 2017 jan he would now have 36k rather then 3k however bitcoin needs stability to be used as means of paying for goods and services but let it self establish first i remember the 2013 1.5k times then down then massive up long story short give it time as long as you only invest money you can afford to loose you can make good Profits just as always the more there is too gain the more there is too loose as well 
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:05:03
That looks really great �� 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:00:37
Well I can only speak for myself. But I will hodl I don’t really buy but invested into mining and that equipment was bought with gains from btc so if everything crashes to zero tomorrow my total lost in fiat is not even 1k. If it goes to crazy levels like six digit dollar It will be amazing either way good ride .
What I am looking to is and that’s far off but if there is another financial crisis world war something like that there is a chance that it will be like in the TV show continuum where we pay with a sort of bitcoin stick 
So I find your recommendation a bit off since nobody forces you to invest into bitcoin and the warning you brought up is questionable remember stock prices 2008. Houses prices in the US same time etc 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:07:35
Love the comments some think it’s worth 14000$ ...
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:01:29
I think with bitcoin worth so much they are after who what’s what and send money to ... and on the other side they want the taxes so they need to know who got what 
And it started already linking persons to bitcoin addresses 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:56:50
well you could give him ~15k$ as gift and you have a chance of getting a 1 BTC in return  
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:20:33
Keep in mind that some of these Wallets represent Exchange's like Kraken they are not theirs they hold them for their clients like if you have 100$ on your bank account the money is with your bank but it's not their it belongs to you simple speaking 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:13:13
Haha �� lucky not but good point ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:28:01
Oh and one more since it’s reddit here I don’t want a war or crisis but we are humans so at some point we may get one as sad as that is 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:32:27
From the Node point of view on MacOS or should i put Linux on the MacMini or is there no difference what so ever from a security point of view/ Performance? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:07:32
Nobody knows for sure it looks like a few % more however as said nobody on this planet has a time machine to look into the future ...  however checking the last two weeks 
gives you an idea but again all investments and speculations have the risk of losing money so always keep in mind play only with money you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:41:38
I am quite happy with Blockchain.info where a have one  I can easy and fast buy within seconds at dips and send small portion to a friend I used it for a btc ATM just to try and it worked. Just as I am sure others will tell you too don’t store lots of coins there for me I handle it like PayPal keep £100 max and rest to your cold storage or in the PayPal example the rest withdraw to your bank account 
And please use their security features 2fa and a Separate password for sending money and stay away from Touch ID login etc 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:26:20
There are some exchanges google is your friend but PayPal  do not allow bitcoin so a purchase would be against there rules and you will have a hard time when it comes to fraud which as said as it is is common many fraudsters and scammers are aiming for bitcoin newbies right now. My advise use one of the trusted bitcoin places coinbase gdax Blockchain.info localbitcoins bitcoin ATMs but be also aware that for example there is a malicious fraud Ad running on google for gdax look for the right ssl cert for example and stay safe 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:02:27
Use the Blockchain.info app it has a 200£~ Limit but you can use your credit / debit card 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:00:15
Hi made a node with the MacMini and will add two nice S3 Antminer which i shoot cheap for some few € that will do the job :) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:31:01
I do that I bought some at the Dip and got some years ago. This is more to give something back and even if needed spend a couple of hundred $ but as said i cant put a full blown noisy miner there
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:13:27
Bad luck this time after that another long block :P and then I had maintenance thought, fuck it and switch off and then there was a block found in minutes :P 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:21:45
Congratulations :) 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:56:53
I would actually like that. making a nice dip buy 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:58:21
Bitcoin can be used for that however the value needs to be more stable because if you earn let’s say $€£ wages and borrow one BTC in Jan 2017 it was 1k now it’s almost 10k$ so as long as you don’t earn in btc and it’s not a stable it don’t make a lot of sense 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:01:05
Crazy when you think about that this only represent about 2.3% of the global mining power ����
Happy to be part of that 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:10:04
I just had £1.6 transaction fee for a 15£ a transaction normal priority that should give you an idea but that can change quickly 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:19:10
Yes that’s odd I had some 30 mins one earlier this one seems to be super crazy long it’s on 99% forever :( 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:20:22
Please invest in BCH have fun and as always always only with money you can afford to loose in case please take that advice seriously 
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:58:44
You could also ask what will be the lottery numbers for next week. Nobody knows for sure. I think it will go up but this is more a guess because as far as I know we can't tell the future :P
@_date: 2019-04-14 19:47:45
Would like to know as well but concerned about security here ...
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:28:53
Exactly that, and i support the decision esp the part where they say you can use your debit card no problem, But i already can see lots off poeple disputing they BTC purchase from December.  which they of course would not do if it would now 25k or so 
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:20:14
Not gonna go into details for obvious reasons but goes to my Wife and if we both die goes to an organization that I think benefits humanity
