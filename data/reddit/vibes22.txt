I did hear Sen. Warner say something along the lines of "there are some huge implications for us in terms of monetary policy.

In theory I agree with you...but I've spent a long time figuring out how to buy BTC, and there are pretty annoying aspects to basically every method at this point (remember...we're in the adopter phase). Coinbase is definitely the cheapest tho, and they are not the only one that has problems like these.
For me the bottom line is that since I believe the long term trend of BTC is way up, I'm willing to put up with shitty adoption infrastructure at the moment to get some of my money tied up in the currency and ride the wave up.

Haha you got me :-), I have been doing a lot of rose-colored daydreaming lately.
Obviously first steps would be getting rid of my student debts, taking care of my family's debts, and ensuring general comfort for myself and my loved ones. But with the remaining 80% or so, I would simply sit on it, waiting for wise opportunities to show up for me to invest in.
This is something that gets me very excited. The idea that we will all soon be individual autonomous actors, making significant capital investments to fund things that we feel will better society/meet a market demand/make us money, etc. I'm a big time agorist and this is such an exciting time for us to be alive! I mentioned Elon Musk in a previous comment -- he's a great example of a guy who is changing the world with his substantial fortune, and the principal mechanism he is changing the world with is free market capitalism.
Now imagine *a whole segment of society* composed of individuals who have made fortunes from bitcoin. Many of us share this same understanding of how best to allocate wealth throughout a society, in voluntary ways that leverage free market forces to create a net increase in wealth for *everyone*. The possibilities for how we might interact are endless. 
Finally, speaking of cooperation, I'd like to mention the Kickstarter model as another tool that will powerfully synergize with BTC. It's funny, some people refer to Kickstarter as a kind of "socialist" means of funding projects. I don't want to get too heavy into political semantics, but it is very cool to see a means to fund projects from the bottom up, while still maintaining the **voluntary** quality that we free-market people tend to cherish.
Once we've got Bitcoin, we've got the good of socialism, ie  collective production and collective sharing of prosperity, and the good of capitalism, ie the firm sovereignty of the individual, voluntaryism, and clear delineation of property rights. Hopefully the government doesn't notice, since as of right now it seems they're the big stick in the mud on our way through ;-).
**tl;dr** Don't worry, shit's gonna be fine.

Sure, good point. With regards to knowledge disseminating through the market (and I don't want to get too bogged down in discussing the efficient market hypothesis or whatever), I think most of us have access to charts or at least access to the sentiment of the community through r/bitcoin, as to whether your BTC will be worth more or less in the future. And people can make the decision on an individual basis whether it's worth it to them personally to exchange their money for goods.
I think we are so used to decades of our currency decreasing in value that we're still stuck in this paradigm of spending being the key to economic growth. If we look back to the 1860's-1913, when America had a deflating currency, amazing innovation happened, and America saw one of the most incredible spurts of economic growth the world has ever seen. Railroads, key infrastructure for oil refining, air travel, the automobile, and many other inventions were brought to market, *and people still spent their deflating money on them*. Some would argue that these conditions were ideal to allow these innovations to be created, since access to capital investments through savings were more plentiful, and the quality that consumers demanded to part from their sound money was higher.

Wait so to clarify... say you purchase something of a larger magnitude with BTC's, say a house/car/getting rid of significant debt. Does that count as "realizing gains"? Or are gains only realized when BTC is converted back into USD?
Edit: I guess the "getting rid of debt" one is a bad example, since one would assume that would be paid in USD, so disregard that.

No way to know if this is true or not. There's little in the way of polling data on BTC owner's use of their own funds, so this is almost definitely little more than a hunch or gut-feeling.


It's true that those who want BTC because they believe it's value should rise over time are speculators, and that they increase the BTC value, but there is nothing "artificial" about that rise. The inflow of capital into BTC is a good thing, it makes early adopters wealthier and makes investing in the BTC infrastructure as a whole easier. A virtuous cycle.

Well, it's sort of half true what you're saying. Bitcoin is used as 1) a store of value and 2) a method of payment.
While the price is skyrocketing, people will mainly use it for  but once we level off, THEN and only then will its use as a payment system really start to flourish. Basically, once all the savings finishes pouring in that people are going to pour in, the price will be less volatile (ie, a $10 million transaction moves the price just a blip), and people can depend on using it as a stable means of exchange.

I'm pretty sure this won't be received too well in the community, but it's a strongly held view so I'm still going to say it.
If dropbox is savvy to the bitcoin economy, they probably assume, rightfully (unfortunately), that even though we are all vehemently advocating for this option, a VERY small % of us will actually pony up the cash and actually start paying for our dropbox account with btc should they give the option. It would be great if they did it, but BTC is better as a store of value right now then as something to use for small incidental expenses like this.
For every 1000 ppl who will casually click a button to vote for something, there's maybe 1 or 2 ppl who will actually part with their BTC to pay for something like this.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:36:55


Are you referring to reporting for sales tax? Or capital gains tax?
Ok let me clarify: I'm asking this for the purpose of determining if capital gains tax applies. So if I buy a bitcoin for a small amount, the value of it grows over time, and I purchase a good (car/house etc) down the road WITH BTC, does capital gains apply or not?


Sorry to pry further but, would you mind expanding on that?
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:03:22
I don't actually think that's true, even though we hear that all the time (BTC's value being a yes or no proposition).
To me it's a lot more likely that it will balloon up to a very large amount (say, $5000) then get displaced by another, completely as-of-yet undreamed of currency with *strong* advantages over BTC. I mean seriously, who the fuck are we to know what we'll use for money in 50 years?
The general trend seems clear, that we'll eventually have competing protocols for money, where money forms compete freely based on their technical qualities, rather than us being in a form of servitude to the political whims of our rulers by being forced to use *their* money.

I would buy and hold. It will be swingy, you may lose some value, but keep holding bitcoins. They WILL appreciate in value, unless one of the following happens.
1) The US government successfully passes laws banning its use (unlikely to work)
2) A better currency is invented and becomes more popular (unlikely to happen)
3) Some as-of-yet undiscovered problem in the system itself becomes a large issue as the bitcoin world grows larger (unlikely, but keep your ears to the ground)

My understanding is that it's an arbitrary problem that is created simply to control the rate at which new money is introduced into the system. It doesn't "benefit" anyone per se, but the feature of the currency that this creates in the bitcoin protcol, a predictable rate of new money creation, is very positive from a macroeconomic standpoint. It makes inflation completely predictable. So it's more of a political/philosophical/economic benefit for the whole system.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:06:32
Even if the government DID own 50% of all bitcoins, what are you saying they could do? Manipulate the price? Even if they owned 99% of all bitcoins, they could only do that on a temporary basis. Eventually the ownership will flow back into the general public.
If they try manipulating by not selling (to drive the price up), well then they just make the currency more valuable, which is probably the opposite of what they want anyway. And if they try to manipulate by selling LOTS (to drive the price down), then they end up losing their ownership. So I really don't see any type of possible malevolent scheme here.

This is tremendous to see. This is exactly the type of press coverage Bitcoin needs right now. And it's coming mainly from one actor (Coinlab) jumping into the market and signaling greater legitimacy of the nascent currency. It's a snowball effect, greater legitimacy will lead to more mainstream press coverage, and eventually lead to increasingly large swaths of society getting in on the action.
Further, it's important to keep in mind something that Roger Ver discussed in his Liberty Forum talk a few weeks ago. As the BTC price continues up, the people who benefit the most are those who recognized the benefits of Bitcoin early. These are people who tend to be peaceful, liberty-minded, voluntarist types. Techno-libertarian free-marketers like Elon Musk. 
Just imagine, we're going to have a bunch of mini-Elon Musks running around the world!! People who believe in free enterprise and NOW have the funds to realize their vision for a more just, more prosperous world.

This sounds right on paper, and it's hard to dispute this point if you've been brainwashed by Keynesians your whole life (as nearly all Westerners have), but this viewpoint, to spend rather than save, rests on VERY faulty logic.
If hoarding results in less transactions, resulting in a stagnant BTC value, then people WOULD begin spending as they wouldn't foresee any potential gains from saving. Then the increase in transactions would again raise the BTC value, resulting in more savings. So it's kind of like an equilibrium. It's self-regulating, there's no need for appeals to citizens of Bitcoinia's 'patriotism' or whatever to keep the economy going.
For further reading, check out Hayek's "paradox of saving". The Austrians had this shit down so go there first, but for the lazy **the tl;dr is: Consumption is NOT the engine of the economy, savings is.** Without savings you don't have investment, without investment you don't have increases in productivity through technology innovation that lead to objective increases in wealth throughout society.
Our mainstream economic doctrine wants economic growth RIGHT NOW, we want our recessions over RIGHT NOW, so our leaders do things to increase consumption right now. They have policies that turn money into a hot potato that everyone wants to get rid of as fast as possible. These policies include inflationary monetary policy (money-printing), artificially low interest rates, wealth taxes, and a tax code that punishes savers and rewards spenders (through deductions and other perverse incentives).

There will be a crash at some point. We just don't know where it will start and where it will end. It could crash from $300 to $100. Or from $150 to $30.

This is called arbitrage. Nothing personal, but you're gonna get downvoted cuz it's a common question (not by me, just in general).
The reason there are different prices is because of the difficulty in getting money in and out of exchanges. In general, the more difficulty it is to get fiat OUT, the higher the price (this is why MtGox is a higher price -- if you sell some BTC and are trying to withdraw USD, you're going to be waiting for weeks/months). So "mtgox USD" is worth less than USD on a different exchange.
If it was super easy to do arbitrage among the exchanges, the opportunity to make money off of it would already have been wiped out, and the prices would be a lot closer to each other.

I think people say it's deflationary in the sense that a fixed amount of currency is chasing more and more goods and services as time goes on and the economy grows. Over time the purchasing power grows.
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:10:03
Hey thanks for the tip! And yes, as someone else said in response to your comment, Capitalism (or free-marketism...whatever....let's not get bogged down with labels) IS the answer, but Keynesian economics, where a government makes *significant* intervention in an economy, is not. The free-market system depends on savings and capital investments, which are very difficult to make in the inflation-fueled, wage-slavery/debt-slavery system we've got now. 
Currency's value should grow as the economy grows, as the fixed units of currency (which really just represent tokens of access to a percentage of the economy as a whole) are suddenly chasing more and more goods and services. 
So the *natural* evolution of money should be for it to deflate/grow in value over time, as the economy as a whole grows. Deflation may not be good for the status quo, it may not be good for people who want aggregate demand to remain artificially high forever and want people buying their bullshit useless products in perpetuity because consumers sense in an inflationary environment that their money is better spent than saved, and it CERTAINLY may not be good for a politician who wants to get reelected in 2-3 years and wants to guarantee the economy will look nice in the here-and-now. But **fuck** those people, your money should grow as the economy grows. You should be able to share in the growing prosperity of the economy you live within.

I'll leave it to your judgement to determine if either of those are likely. My gut says you're fine, but it's worth noting that the arrangement you made with your friend, to buy BTC with his money, requires at least a small amount of trust in him.

I alluded to this elsewhere in the thread but I thought I would put this here to make the point clear. The fundamental misunderstanding within this idea is the notion that people or groups of people would *need* to do something like Fractional Reserve Banking in order to "get their share of the economy".
This is not true.
Because BTC is a currency with essentially a flat supply (inflating it is impossible), that means that as a BTC based economy grows, holders of BTC will *naturally* become wealthier in real terms. Even if you had 10BTC one year, and 10BTC five years later, if the underlying economy that uses BTC has grown by 10x, that means *by definition* that there is 10x more stuff for your BTC to purchase. You are *wealthier*. The same amount of currency is chasing more and more goods and services.
By buying a Bitcoin today, you are ALREADY purchasing a share of the BTC economy as a whole. As that economy, so will your wealth in real terms (purchasing power). No need for bullshit like FRB, the wealth will be proportionally distributed naturally.
@_date: 2013-03-02 03:08:54
Hmph, well that sucks. I personally got my original price, but it was something like 20BTC originally bought at $24ish, and by the time I got them it was around $27ish, so not a gigantic move. But they honored that. I have a personal friend who they honored the original price for also.

DING DING DING. That's right. In a market system interest rates fluctuate with demand for credit. Also, u wouldn't need to do FRB to get your "slice of the economy", as the economy grows your BTC purchasing power will increase.

Welp....considering almost all of America doesn't own BTC, probably either do nothing or buy.

Yeah, full disclosure...I haven't used bitfloor before, but I've read numerous accounts of them working well. YMMV I guess.

Yay! My first bitcoin tip!! I'm stoked, but it's funny cuz now this will lead to me stopping procrastinating and finally learn how to use the tipbot, and I'll end up giving back 100x what I just got.
And the virtuous circle continues!
Thanks again, you're a gentleman and a scholar.

I am not an expert, but from what I've heard China has far more in the way of capital controls in their country. Bitcoin could be just the way for them to circumvent these controls. Many are also very technically inclined (the Great Firewall of China teaching many young kids how to use VPNs, etc.), so this seems like a ripe market for growth.

Thanks, just did it and it works! Thanks for the help, makes me less nervous about having to rely on a single website to access my wallet. Thanks again for the help.

but how can one read that thread and definitely connect it to SR?

Hey no problem. I was arriving at work this morning and I read this and I finally thought "enough is enough! time to wallpost". Obviously OP is well-intentioned, but we don't need to force or coerce people to malinvest their property to make our economy grow.

Looks to my eyes like the page has been significantly edited since yesterday, and I'm satisfied with the new intro.

Here's a second thing Sen. Warner said (at 29:41 of [this video](
"A lot of people who use this have a serious distrust of central banks. Huge amount of implications"
I think he may have been one of the few senators who understands the more global effects this could have on reshaping society.

Thanks for the reply. Just so I'm getting this right, is the private key protected by a password? Or is the private key *the same as* your password? I've downloaded a wallet.aes.json file from blockchain.info, is that the same as my private key? I know that's password protected...
