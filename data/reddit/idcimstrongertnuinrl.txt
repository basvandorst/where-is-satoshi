This is dumb, and an unnecessary risk 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:19:53
What date is it?? 
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:28:41
What I'm trying to say is that by Dogecoin doing all the PR for crypto, there is no need for Bitcoin to.
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:30:51
That's irrelevant. By making Dogecoin's presence felt in the "mainstream" it legitimizes cryptos to the average joe.
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:50:08
Its not riding off of dogecoin. But as dogecoin has "no real value" (read pennies on the dollar) once people see "internet monies" influencing real life, people will be more open to the idea.
Its about promoting the idea of crypto, not one coin or another.
@_date: 2014-05-06 23:00:40
I actually think that Dogecoin people are probably huge advocates for Bitcoin. But using the "joke" coin and proving IT's legitimacy, will only further establish Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:44:28
You aren't understanding that it doesn't matter if/when it crashes. The goal is legitimizing the idea of cryptocurrencies, not any one coin.
@_date: 2014-05-07 05:25:59
But not value that people are concerned about. Bitcoiners are treating their coins like a life investment.
Dogecoin people are throwing em around like the world is their strip club because they have hundreds of thousands of them.
And I don't blame either of them for doing so, it's just the reason for what is happening between the 2.

It's like 20 cents, if I could afford to put more in I would. My girlfriend isn't too crazy about me spending anything, says I'm wasting money. I'll show her... Lol

I buy small amounts of coins ($5 weekly)  and it always takes a couple days for them to be in my account. 
AFAIK it's business as usual
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:58:04
Perhaps we should've elected someone that wanted to audit the Fed...
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:49:50
And this is just a university, imagine the resources available to government agencies. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:31:41
Aaaaaand nevermind. Just dropped the price equivalent. This is goooooood 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:35:56
And now we're cheetos eating losers lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:54:35
That was only 4 months ago. I'm not saying he's right but I would hold my tongue.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:21:22
Any publicity is good publicity? I thought this put more of a negative light on it 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:26:55
Bitcoin on tenderloin
@_date: 2018-07-16 22:48:05
He looks like a swash buckler 
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:29:36
Yeah I fucked up 
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:52:15
Only 2 of those locks do anything... 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:55:48


Definitely take this guys advice 
Kidding 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:44:05
Could probably turn that into an article and make some money in it 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:45:46
So.... Start? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:16:15
The .03 the bank offers me is really driving me wild
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:22:02
At least your family values your opinion enough to pay attention to things you are interested in. I try to converse with my family about similar topics and get completely ignored.
@_date: 2013-06-20 19:17:17
Bitcoin is the perfect way to introduce a one-world currency.
