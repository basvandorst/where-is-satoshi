Because the exchanges between mtgox BTC and other BTC have dropped so low people may think it is worth the gamble, there are possible returns of 1000%

Considering they are currently buying BTC for $459 each, despite the value on other exchanges being  much lower at about $435, this is not economically viable in any way. My guess is they have a bunch of paypal funds they are willing to spend on building reputation, since many people have posted saying they have done trades. People will soon realize the arbitrage potential here, making around $25 per BTC, my guess is the owners are hoping people realize this and begin buying large amounts of bitcoins to sell onto btcpromo, i guess at that point they will scam their customers....
either that or they are sending you paypal money from stolen paypals.

I have sent him an invoice for the sum of $10 because of this terrible joke.

Almost all other cryptos are only purchased by exchanging BTC for them, the price of BTC has risen but the exchange for the currencies stay around the same.

The reality is no one knows.
Generally whenever bitcoin is doing well the only posts you see with price predictions are predicting increases, then suddenly it begins to fall and all of the "i knew it was going to drop" people come out of the wood works predicting it'll fall more, it generally doesn't and they all become quiet.
