If you are running Linux, you don't have to wait for the feature to be implemented. You can use tc to limit the amount of bandwidth for the application just have a look at [lartc.org]( I'm not saying you shouldn't look for this to be implemented in Bitcoin, but this is a workaround you can use in the mean time.

When I saw the prices in 2013, I was really kicking myself that I didn't at least buy one in 2011. I still keep kicking myself because I could have turned $20 into $800.

Is it common to introduce people to Bitcoin by giving them a small amount?

Everyone could then fork the release they don't mind and just run that code base instead. Problem solved.

So do you send exactly 1/30 of a coin for every commit or does it depend on the size of the contribution?

Both were cool man.

Math wise if you want to calculate a 100% increase it would actually be n * 2. If you want to give a 5% increase that would involve multiplying by 1.05. So 1.09 * 4 is going to be a 300% increase. Now it is correct to say that is 4 times what it was but not that it increased by 400%.

I guess that means the Slashdot effect is illegal then. I guess sites like reddit and Slashdot should be banned in the UK.

This is a very valid point because Linux itself started off as something off-topic in the Minix Usenet group.

The only intention was to test the capacity of the network which is valid for current discussions regarding the future of Bitcoin. Disruption just happens to be a side effect of that test.
As far as the effect goes, I don't see how it matters between one person causing disruption and thousands to millons. A crime is a crime whether it was commited by one person or n people. The only reason the Slashdot effect is seen as absurd for being a crime is it is part of the intended use of the web and sometimes that leads to outages. The same can be said for Bitcoin. And with Bitcoin we need to make sure transactions can still occur under a heavy load which is why stress tests are needed and conducted. If the law views a necessary good as unlawful, then the law is unjust and should be revised or at least questioned.

Dead reckoning is another method as you know the exact distance from one point to another. Combine that with known speed and timed intervals you should get a pretty good idea of what your position is, especially in combination with GPS and unique terrain features like mountains and curves in the tracks.
