Most casual people are getting rekt trying to time the market. Yuo have your coins in cold storage. price starts to drop. Uh oh. Doesn't matter, you're still green. Price drops further, near your entry price. You have put in too much, you don't want to lose $.
Move from cold storage to exchange. Pay fees. Waiting for coins to arrive. Price drops faster. Panic mode on. Coins finally arrive, price is below your entry price. Fuck this, I'm selling at a loss, will rebuy when it drops further.
Sell at market price to a happy whale. Price stabilizes. Begins to spike. Well, I wait for another dip. Doesn't happen. Price rises. Panic mode on. Don't want to miss the ride! Rebuy. You now have 0.8 BTC instead of 1. Move 0.8 BTC to cold storage. Pay fees.
Rinse and repeat,
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:18:58
Because when you sell and wait for it to go lower it usually spikes and you panic rebuy

Well, I heard Gold is pretty valuable too and I have seen very few people actually "using" it.
@_date: 2019-06-20 10:48:52
You don't need exchanges anymore then
@_date: 2019-04-22 06:50:41
Yeah, but without cash they wouldn't even have to physically print it
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:23:01
Paper cash isn't yours either, they devalue it by inflation
@_date: 2019-04-01 12:16:42
In theory, moderate currency inflation is a good thing because it stimulates people to actually spend their cash instead of keeping it under the matress and thus keep the economy going. Money isn't intended to be a store of value, except you store it in a savings account (which effectively means lending money to the bank so they can put it in circulation)
The problem are the low or even negative interest rates for saving accounts, wich traditionally provided a good store of value because they had higher interest rates than the inflation.
When interest rates are lower than the inflation it's a good idea to go in debt (buy a house or something), since your debt will be reduced by inflation, too.
I have put a good amount of my wealth into my house and have invested in crypto and ETFs. I only have 2-3 times of my monthly earnings in cash.

I already discussed a hardware wallet with him but he said he is okay with CB. When BTC goes up even more I will try to convince him again.
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:11:57
Actually, (some) inflation is a good thing to encourage people to actually spend their money (which is the basic use case for currency)
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:02:22
Trust in a third party is required if you want to buy BTC with fiat. Just get your funds out of exchanges immediately after they appear in your account

It's not about basic needs and you know that
@_date: 2019-04-15 06:44:38
Actually, people are spending much less for their basic need nowadays than in the 19th century. And it's way lower than in the 70ies/80ies (at least in developed countries). Currently it's 14% of the income in Germany:

@_date: 2019-04-14 15:52:54
What makes you so sure about that? Because you are invested? The sole promise and use case of Bitcoin is being a non-inflationary, decentralized currency that everybody uses in the future and that is controlled/run by everybody.
Currently, its value is based on pure speculation. People are reluctant to actually spend it (plus it' hard to actually do so). Since mining rewards halve every now and then and eventually stop completely, Bitcoin absolutely MUST be established as a widely accepted, global currency that people actually spend in order to keep the network running (make transaction fees profitable).
This CAN happen, but it's absolutely possible that it won't happen. It's a bit naive to think taht it inevitably WILL happen.

If you're looking for some quick gains in trading, BTC is probably not your best option. Why not betting on some pump and dump alts. There's always some shitcoin mooning. BTC is a long term hold (for me at least).
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:30:22
Maybe it pumps to 50K (maybe not likely but not impossible) just after your stop-limit triggered?
@_date: 2019-04-28 11:32:45
Because I may be fucking dead when it reaches 100.
It's important to set your goals. I am 48 years old now and if I stay healthy I have another 30-35 years statistically. And the last five or ten years I will probably not be free to decide where I am going or what I am doing next.
Personally, I will trade away a third  of my BTC (not necessarily trade for fiat but goods/services if possible) when it reaches $50K at any point within the next 5 years. And I will accumulate more below 5-6K, but will never invest more than about 5-7.5% of my net worth (translates to "can afford to lose")
2024 is a good target, two halvings are going to happen and I guess until then it is pretty much decided how this game plays out.
@_date: 2019-04-03 14:48:00
Depends on how much you have on CB. And I bet that there are much more coins lost/stolen because noobs are making mistakes outside the exchanges. Like giving away private keys to scammers, sending to wrong addresses, getting hacked or simply losing their credentials. Most people are not used to the fact that lost/forgotten passwords/keys in crypto MEANS lost funds and that there is no "Restore password" option or a phone hotline to call.
My dad has like 0.2 BTC and 3 or 4 ETH on Coinbase and I absolutely advise him to leave them there.
@_date: 2019-04-25 16:38:26
I thought there are only 17 million

If the seed is valid but results in another address/wallet, you probably created another wallet in the past.

We're talking about interest rates for savings accounts. Interest rates for loans won't probably go below zero. But they are already pretty low.

Stablecoins \*are\* exactly what you discribe in your bank run scenario. They hand out "dollar" coins that are not fully backed by a dollar reserve.
It's like banks nowadays  handing out dollar bills not fully backed by gold ("fractional reserve").
@_date: 2019-04-11 11:37:50
Why not go all in when "they will be worth more"?
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:26:47
Yup, but this has not much to do with currency inflation/deflation, it's clever marketing of status symbols to dumb people.
I used to have about 3-4 monthly wages in my savings account a few years ago when the interest rate was about the same as the inflation (1.5 - 2% in Europe). These times are gone. Either you spend it, invest it or it's gone. And that's exactly the purpose of low interest rates and inflation
@_date: 2019-04-23 07:22:21
I don't see any of the Top20 outperform BTC in the long run (which is the only reason to get them anyway) and those further down are highly speculative and useless in most cases. If you have free money to gamble with you can try your luck with day trading pump and dump coins.
But really, you want BTC if you're in for the long run. If it succeeds as a global currency/store of value most of the alts are meaningless anyway and if it fails the whole crypto scene will probably fail.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:03:12

"Stop loss" implies that you have to trust your coins to an exchange which is not a good idea. It's not only that they can be hacked, there is absolutely no guarantee that your stop-loss orders are being processed when shit hits the fan. I remember Coinbase for example going down multiple times during the early 2018 crash

Have fun with a dip triggering your stop losses and then having to rebuy at a higher price level after recovery.
Besides that, this would require to leave BTC on a centralized, unregulated exchange. Good luck with that. As prices rise, exchanges tend to get "hacked".
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:45:56
This is cascading stop losses triggering in action. Guys will have to rebuy higher when they wake up
@_date: 2019-05-08 08:36:31
It doesn't really matter. It would instantly destroy Bitcoin's credibility. Immutability is fundamental. If some Chinese could "rollback" the blockchain because of 7K stolen BTC, governments and banks could do this also.
