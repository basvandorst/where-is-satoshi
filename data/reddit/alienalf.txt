Do you think his plans about using bitcoin for megaupload would trigger USA &amp; China to regulate bitcoin/cryptocurrency laws in bad way? including banning?
@_date: 2016-08-26 08:52:46
in the article its pointed as possibility: "A request from the government to ban any cryptocurrency-related advertisements." 
its also pointed:
"it may be the Chinese government’s plan to censor out independent cryptocurrencies and push for the advertisement of state-owned and government controlled Blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies.
China’s commercial banks have already established a consortium to conduct research on Blockchain technology and have also introduced various applications to evaluate its applicability in the Chinese financial industry. Thus, although unlikely, it makes the second theory a possibility."
do you think this is good?

yes but im not asking personally, im asking globally. is there any reason that some exchanges will not adopt these systems for any reason? Like; coinbase, poloniex, bitstamp, bitfinex like huge ones going to adopt or are we going to have similar drama like s2x?? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:02:43
that means they have to adopted by exchange wallets or hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:09:04

zerohedge is one of the biggest FUDDER i have ever saw, they are LYING, they wrote this:
"Still, Bloomberg reports that Kobayashi is sitting on another approximately $1.9 billion, which he says he plans to offload soon..."
so just open the bloomberg article that they were pointing: 
and now tell me where is written that they will offload "soon"? what soon? where is written? 
zerohedge is just liar and fudder.
