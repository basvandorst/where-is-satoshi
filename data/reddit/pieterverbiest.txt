Shut up and take my bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-15 08:23:11
more liquidity needs to come in, so market is not that vulnerable to price manipulation by whales or certain groups...
now the market is to small and to easy to manipulate for those benefiting from it.
this needs regulations

thx for your advise redditor for 1 day,
Feels so good that people with the right knowledge help the ones
with less insight in the market, since you say it will never be back above 6000
I think I'm gonna sell all my bitcoin and take the loss. again, thank you,
otherwise I would just loose more

true, but whales start a move with regular joe following it's steps,  
Panic selling, or fomo buying, everybody know's the basic buy low sell high but yet more people fomo buy high because they are scared now, whales are smarter...

I understand what you say, but regulations will have to come whether you like it or not, big investment firms don't put there moneys in a unregulated market. This will only work more towards global adoption...
