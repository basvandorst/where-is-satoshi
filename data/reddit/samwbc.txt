If you are asking how are they different, GDAX is an exchange where you can place limit orders on an order book in addition to market orders.  GDAX is like the typical exchange.  Coinbase is an online wallet and brokerage service where you buy/sell BTC at the market price only (market taking).  When comparing fees between exchanges, I see some people compare Coinbase wallet/brokerage service with other exchanges when they should actually be comparing GDAX Exchange with other exchanges.   GDAX Exchange provides some of the lowest fees I think.

I like this resolution.  I would have taken the BTC back when they cancelled my order last year instead of the gift card even if it is delayed.  The moment I pay for something with BTC, it is like selling my BTC.  If I really didn't want to use my BTC savings then I would have bought some BTC with USD at that moment to buy the product.  For example, if an item was $100 USD then I'd buy $100 USD worth of BTC and spend it.  If I get a refund, then a $100 USD refund in cash or BTC is fair as I would now be in the same position as I was before I placed the order.

Governments print money.  Sometimes they print too much which dilutes the supply, and by definition creates inflation at the expense of its citizens.  It's analogous to my 2nd example where the company issues new shares rather than splitting a stock.  Printing money increases supply.  In contrast, after all bitcoins have been mined, there will be no equivalent in bitcoin to printing money.

So for example, he would have to buy bitcoins at CAVirtex at the current ask price of $650/btc and then sell them on Quadriga at the current bid price of $627/btc for a loss of 3.5% + 1.3% trade fee for a total loss of 4.8%.

It's like a stock split.  A 10-1 stock split will increase the amount of shares by 10 but each one is 1/10th of the value.  The market cap doesn't change right away and your share of the company remains the same.  For example, if a company had 100 shares in its float and you owned 10 shares, then you own 10% of the company.  If the stock splits 10-1, there are now 1000 shares and you have 100 shares and you still own 10% of the company.   Contrast this with the company issuing 900 new shares.  Now the company has 1000 shares but you only own 10 and so now you only own 1% of the company instead of 10% previously.  If bitcoin gains a new decimal place, people will still own the same percentage of bitcoins as before.  This is not the same as creating 9x more bitcoins and diluting the supply.

Yes, they call it a Natural Ponzi scheme now, like gold, stocks, and real-estate.  For some reason, World Bank felt a need to completely change the existing definition of Ponzi (which was based on fraud) to include financial bubble (which isn't based on fraud).  So now Ponzi scheme doesn't necessarily mean that it is a scheme based on fraud anymore.

Forget about Bitcoin, it is insecure.  Just give me your VISA number, expiry date, billing address, and phone number.  Don't worry, your info is safe with me, I promise.  Your identity is safe.  Every merchant that you give this info to is honest didn't you know.  With Bitcoin, um, um, oh yeah, if you let someone else manage your wallet, like a small exchange or a stranger, they can take your bitcoin.  Yeah, that's it.  It's unsafe because if you give it to someone else to store, they can take it, kind of like cash.  So think about it, if you put your bitcoins in a wallet that someone else has access to, they can take your bitcoin.   This can't happen with fiat right?  Oh wait.

Probably because people use the other definition of virtual when using the word virtual: 


Virtual reality: Not reality but a simulation of reality
Virtual memory: Not real RAM but uses a storage device like hard drive to act as RAM
Virtual machine: Not the real physical machine but an emulator
Virtual currency: Not real currency.  Linden dollars, QQ coin, Amazon coin are obvious virtual currencies.  Many people who don't believe Bitcoin can be legitimate would then call Bitcoin a virtual currency.  So whether someone believes Bitcoin is a virtual currency depends on which side of legitimacy they believe in.  The gov't and the naysayers would label Bitcoin a virtual currency.  :)  I'm not saying it's wrong to call Bitcoin a virtual currency but I can see how calling it virtual downplays it.  :)

I agree the Coindesk article is fine.  It is simply pointing out what the World Bank article reported.

That it has value or not, is not the issue.  At least what it means is that the US Gov't doesn't deem it is illegal like crack or coke (which also has value) which they wouldn't sell back to the public.  It also means that they don't think it is a Ponzi or Pyramid scheme which again is illegal.  So this goes against 2 of the big misconceptions against Bitcoin that many people have.

OP is pointing out that there is no supply problem.  One of the arguments against Bitcoin is that there is a limited supply and so it will never work as a currency.  A lot of people think that there are only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins mined so there are not enough to go around and so it is useless as a currency.  They don't understand that there will actually be 2.1 quadrillion units.
When I explain it to some people, they still argue that 2.1 quadrillion units is not enough.  Then when I say that as Bitcoin is software, it could theoretically move a decimal place to increase the supply by 10x, some people still want to argue that it doesn't solve the supply problem.

The idea of a silent auction is that you can don't know what everyone else is bidding.  A bidder would put in his highest bid using the one bid that he has. If everyone knew what his bid was, they would outbid him.  So there would be no point for him to even bid then.

When a merchant uses a 3rd party like Bitpay to accept Bitcoin, I would imagine that is similar to being treated like a foreign currency.  So I would ask the question, what happens when a store in the USA accepts a foreign currency like CAD from a customer?  Well, a store that accepts CAD probably visits the bank or currency dealer at some point and exchanges it for USD.  The bank or currency dealer later sells the CAD maybe to a customer who plans to travel to Canada and around it goes.  Bitpay would do the same thing as the bank or currency dealer.  They take bitcoins from customer and give USD to the merchant and then at some point sell the bitcoins to someone else who needs it (through an exchange most likely but not necessarily).

Think of bitcoin as another currency.  If USD crash, how do we know the value of Canadian dollar?  If USD crash how do we know the value of Euro?  IF USD crash, how do we know the value of British pound?    Assuming in your hypothetical situation that only USD crashed and no other world currency crashed, then if all else constant and USD crashed to 50% of its former value against world markets, then the USD would also have crashed 50% against bitcoin.  Bitcoin isn't pegged to the USD.

To me, the Blockchain is the heart. If it stops working (stops pumping), there is no Bitcoin. Exchanges and Payment processors enable the Bitcoin economy to grow faster.  Like a network backbone interconnects network nodes to other networks and nodes, the Bitcoin backbone interconnects merchants, customers, buyers, investors, and service providers. Without these, commerce and utility is possible but very limited.  So I would call exchanges and payment processors the backbone for the Bitcoin economy (agreeing with the article).

A person could skip that question in the survey.  No need to put in fake answers to mislead.   Asking how many bitcoins one owns in a survey about Bitcoin demographics is kind of normal.  I've filled out many surveys asking me what my income is in the past.  If I don't want to answer it, I don't.  It's not an unusual question to ask when the goal of a survey is to study demographics.  Given a choice between putting fake answers and skipping questions if I don't want to answer, I would think skipping the question is the preferred option.

"Naturally Occurring Ponzis ... that is, financial bubbles that form without the manipulator’s baton but from finished natural market forces and with one person’s expectations feeding into another’s. ... When the bubble eventually bursts and prices return to a more realistic level, a whole lot of people who had bought a home at a high price expecting it to go higher lose out. The deflation of such bubbles has ravaged lives through the history of humankind.  Gold provides another stark example of bubbles and crashes since, apart from decorative and small industrial uses, gold has little innate value." [World Bank source] (
So now World Bank classifies gold, real-estate and stocks as a Ponzi scheme under this newly made up definition of Natural Ponzi scheme. Kind of silly to change the definition of a Ponzi scheme from being a fraud-based scheme to a not necessarily fraud-based scheme if you put the word natural in front of it. Just call a bubble a bubble. Bubbles are bad. No need to create a new Ponzi scheme definition to fit financial bubble into it. 
The next time someone calls Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme, we can now reference the World Bank article and say back that so is gold, real-estate, and stocks.

Apples and Oranges.  It is inherently expensive to upgrade hardware by upgrading its components.  Hardware is normally replaced with new hardware.  Bitcoin is software.  Software is easier and cheaper to upgrade and is indeed often upgraded/updated by developers.  It is certainly possible that something new can be brought to the table that is better than today's Bitcoin.  But it is also possible and likely for Bitcoin itself to evolve over time into something better than it is today which makes its predicted obsolescence less certain than the Spectrum.

Misinformation.  The ability to store your bitcoins securely in a bank vault for savings or for backup is hardly a disadvantage.  Putting the USB drive in the bank vault is not more secure from hackers than keeping the USB drive under your bed.  Using a bank vault is simply in case of disaster or theft in which case you can recover your bitcoins.  You can just as easily keep the external encrypted backup at a relative's house or locked up at work.  
I would disagree that this is one the reasons that Bitcoin is not widely used.  Everyday users could use Bitcoin without needing to keep them in cold storage.  The article is mixing up cold storage with wallet services.

For people with bitcoins to spend, they will probably predominantly be travelling/vacationing in places that have Internet access.  Targeting the larger economies is probably going to be more beneficial and productive at first.  
Get the largest and easiest market share first.  Worry about the smaller markets later.  Not the other way around.  That doesn't mean the smaller 3rd world markets can't benefit from it eventually.   I just don't think they are the primary target market at this point in time.  Its going to be hard enough and will take a long while just to adopt and accept bitcoin widely in the modern economies.

Some people like to collect precious metal coins.  Assuming there aren't extra fees for bitcoin payment, this allows someone to buy the precious metal coins at the discounted cash rate without needing to pay fees to wire it or to pay for a cashier's check and mailing it.  In this case, it's basically converting cash to a digital form and sending it to them for payment.  Let's say I buy $500 in bitcoin, send it to them and they sell the bitcoins immediately for $500.  There's no change in the supply or demand in this case since it is $500 in, and $500 out.  We also don't know if Provident is keeping their cryptos or cashing out right away.
The supply and demand equation would change however if I instead used my existing bitcoins to pay for this and didn't buy back (decrease in demand) or if Provident keeps their cryptos (increase in demand).

If I understand correctly, the gov't seized assets like their homes and sold them off.  This is fine as my point is that Bitcoin is a legal asset just like a home.  So the gov't would sell Bitcoin just like it would sell the home.  Now, if the website was selling some particular "investment fund" for the purpose of running a Ponzi scheme and then the gov't seized them, they wouldn't be reselling them to the public because that would be continuing to run the Ponzi scheme themselves.

    A can of Coca Cola is about $1.  To find USD/BTC when the can of coke is 20 bits:  
    $1 USD/.00002000 BTC = $50,000 USD/BTC 
    Therefore when 20 bits is worth a $1, the price of a BTC is $50,000 USD 
    A Big Mac is about $4.50 USD.  To find USD/BTC when the Big Mac is 50 bits:  
    $4.50 USD/.00005000 BTC = $90,000 USD/BTC
    Therefore, when 50 bits is worth $4.50 USD, the price of a BTC is $90,000 USD  
    A gallon of milk is about $3.75 USD.  To find USD/BTC when a gallon of milk is 15 bits:  
    $3.75 USD/.00001500 BTC = $250,000 USD/BTC
    Therefore, when 15 bits is worth $3.75 USD, the price of a BTC is $250,000 USD  
    Similarly, if the milk was selling for 10 bits, then $3.75/.00001 = $375,000 USD per BTC

A couple of reasons off the top of my head.  If Bitcoin was adopted globally, then I don't need to go to a bank and buy foreign currency of every country that I want to travel to.  I would simply spend my bitcoin at each country.  As a local currency, if it was accepted widely, I won't need to find a cash machine everytime I needed cash since I could spend my bitcoin from my phone.  Its the convenience that it offers.  Right now, there's no convenience because it is not widely accepted.  That's why people get excited when businesses accept bitcoin.  It gives Bitcoin more value through utility as it gets wider acceptance.

For me, my Canadian bank will buy USD from me for 1.3602 CAD and sell USD to me for 1.4445 CAD.  That's a 5.8% spread, 2.9% in each direction.  This is normal and matches what other people are getting at our banks (see link below that calculated 2.8% charge in each direction at RBC).  
The spread at a bitcoin exchange however are higher.  For example, at Quadriga, their CAD/USD exchange rate right now is 1.3535 to buy and 1.4687 to sell.  That's a spread of 7.8%, which is 3.9% each way.  
I don't have the full details of your situation but you are converting USD to GBP so either your exchange or your bank is doing the conversion.  If it is your exchange, take a look at your Transaction history log.  It'll tell you what your exchange rate was.  If it was your bank then it'll be posted in your bank account Transaction history.

Don't forget to read the blog that his tweet is referring to.  He is trying to make a statement about how Bitcoin and those non-dividend-paying stocks in his blog are similar.   :)
From his blog:
"At a dollar, I could make an argument that Gandalf could be attractive. Its market was growing, and compared to the competition, it was reasonably valued on a price-sales or price-earnings basis. But at $20, the company’s market value was close to $1 billion – which in those days was real money. The situation was crazy. People were buying the stock because other people were buying the stock."
"Stocks don’t go up because companies do well or do poorly. Stocks go up and down depending on supply and demand. If a stock is marketed well enough to create more demand from buyers than there are sellers, the stock will go up. What about fundamentals? Fundamentals is a word invented by sellers to find buyers."
"If you really think of it, when a stock doesn’t pay dividends, there really isn’t a whole lot of difference between a share of stock and a baseball card."
"Savvy investors? I was shocked. Of the 63 companies and 400-plus participants we visited, I would be exaggerating if I said we got 10 good questions about our business and how it worked. The vast majority of people in the meetings had no clue who we were or what we did. They just knew that there were a lot of people talking about the company and they should be there."
"They might not have had a clue, but that didn’t stop them from buying the stock. We batted 1.000. Every single investor we talked to placed the maximum order allowable for the stock."
"But once you get past the raising capital part of the market, the stock market becomes not only inefficient, but as close to a Ponzi scheme as you can get."

Economic theory of free markets.  Supply and Demand.
In the above graph, start at D2 (demand curve) and S2 (supply curve).  The equilibrium price is P1.  If all else constant and there is new supply created, the supply curve shifts to the right and the price decreases.  In order for the price to go back to P1, the demand curve has to shift.  In the diagram above, the demand curve must shift up to D1 for the price to stay the same.  In other words, if there was no new demand to buy the new supply, the price would decrease.  Since the price has not decreased and instead stayed the same, this means that there must be new buyers to buy the increased supply of bitcoin.

I had this happen at Newegg.  During their Bitcoin promotion, I bought a PS4 plus filler and paid with bitcoin.  They had technical difficulties with that promotion I remembered.  Anyways, after paying for my order with bitcoin, it was immediately rejected by the system and I was refunded with credit.  So after talking to online support, the rep told me that the system cancelled the order because I had already used up the promotion and can't use it again and they can't do anything about it and that was that (this was untrue because clearly my account history showed no such thing).  So I placed another order for the PS4 and paid by bitcoin again (I didn't use the credit because the promotion was only applicable when paying by bitcoin) and this time, the order was not rejected and was shipped (so clearly the first order that was rejected was a system error).  So in the end, I paid for the PS4 plus about 2 btc worth of Newegg credit which I didn't need.  Fortunately, I found a friend to buy the credit from me at a 10% discount otherwise, I would still have credit (from their mistake) and be forced to spend it there.

I had the same result when they cancelled my PS4 order that I paid for with Bitcoin during their bitcoin promo.  Their system cancelled the order immediately and refunded me with credit because it believed that I used the promo once already (I did not).  Instead of accepting my bitcoin payment, the system should have just rejected the order instead of accepting it and automatically cancelling it.  That made no sense.
So I couldn't use the credit to place the new order because then I would be paying for the item at full price without the bitcoin discount.  So I reordered the PS4 with bitcoin successfully (after they fixed their system) and was left with $400-$500 in credit that I had to spend at Newegg.  Luckily I was able to sell the credit to a friend for 10% off.  But I still lost out due to their mistake.

It was one of those spend $500 and get $150 off promotions when paying for the order with bitcoin in full.  So my PS4 with filler was $500 and I paid $350 in btc.  When they cancelled my order, they refunded me $350 in credit.  Now if I placed my next order for the PS4 and paid in credit, then I would have to use $350 in credit plus add additionally $150 since I am no longer using bitcoin to pay for my order and that means I don't get the $150 discount.

It's more like a stock split than splitting a pizza.  When you split a pizza, each new slice is smaller than the original so the weight or quantity of the whole pizza doesn't change after the split which means there is no new pizza created.  When you split something non-physical like stocks, each new share is no different than the other.  The number of tradable units (which is what we care about) does increase.  Therefore, there is indeed an increase in supply when talking about stocks splits.
To illustrate, if a company had 2 million shares outstanding, after a 2-1 stock split, there would be 4 million shares outstanding.  However, each shareholder's ownership in the company stays the same.  A shareholder who owned 10% of all shares still owns 10% of all shares.  
The other way to increase supply of a stock is when the company issues new shares.  So if a company had 2 million shares outstanding and issues 2 more million shares, then again, the supply has increased to 4 million.  But this time, the existing shareholder's ownership has decreased by half.  Someone that used to own 10% of the shares, now owns 5%.   
In both examples above, the supply of shares increased from 2 to 4 million.  
So moving a decimal in Bitcoin is like the first example.  The supply does indeed increase but the percent of bitcoins owned by each person stayed the same immediately after the increase.
I would say that the supply of bitcoins is finite for now but won't say that it can't change later.  Moving a decimal in bitcoin is like a stock split.  A stock split increases supply of shares without changing the percent of ownership.

Welcome to Another option:
Find an exchange with high volume for both order books.  Might not be easy.  Check the order books ahead of time.  Some exchanges that support both USD and CAD are QuadrigaCX and Kraken.
1. Deposit CAD to QuadrigaCX using EMT (free), Interac (1.5% min $5), bank wire, bank draft, check
2. Buy BTC with CAD (current ask price is $352 CAD/BTC) plus 0.5% trade fee.
3. Sell BTC for USD (current bid price is $279 USD/BTC) less 0.5% trade fee.
4. Withdraw USD to US Bank, VISA (free) Paypal (free), or check ($5)
Obviously these btc prices will fluctuate so you will have to do some checking of the order books ahead of time and you will have to check the funding and withdrawal options and fees.  Then see how close you are to the foreign exchange rate that the banks will give you.
Banks will add a foreign exchange fee or has a spread between their buy and sell price.  For example, RBC's will sell $1 CAD to you for $0.803 USD and will buy $1 CAD from you for $0.756 USD.  So it looks like their fee is about 3%.  So you want to get more than $0.756 USD for your $1 CAD when calculating how much you will get from using bitcoin.  Using the buy and sell prices for Quadriga before fees, you would be getting $279/$352 which is $0.79 exchange rate (You will get 79c USD for each $1CAD).  So, add the trade fees, deposit fees, and withdraw fees and see if you are still ahead.  The trade fees are only 1% total and if you go with free EMT to deposit and free Paypal/VISA to withdraw, then I think you will be ahead given this particulate example.  Of course, when the buy and sell prices change on Quadriga, your exchange rate will change.  Having a spreadsheet would be useful to determine if converting CAD to USD using BTC is worth doing at a particular exchange.
EDIT: Forgot to add that some exchanges will also let you convert your CAD into USD without needing to trade BTC in each direction.  QuadrigaCX's exchange rate for example is currently 0.743 so this is not as good as RBC.  The advantage is that you can withdraw the USD to your VISA or Paypal account whereas with RBC you will get cash or pay for a casher's check.

If a customer returns or cancels an order, then I agree they should get credit.  
However, I think if Newegg cancels an order, the refund should be in the original form of payment (btc in this case).  It was not the customer's fault that the company reneged on the sale.  I had the same thing happen at Newegg last year during the get $150 off $500 promotion when paying with btc.  They cancelled my order by mistake and I got my $350 back in credit.  I could not use this credit to place a new order for the $150 off $500 discount.  Many conversations with customer support resulted in no resolution.   I ended up spending another $350 in btc on a new order which went through just fine.  In the end, I spent $700 btc to get $500 in goods and $350 in credit.  So the credit forced me to buy $350 more in items.  Essentially, the promotion turned into get $150 off $850 for me.

Cashier: "it's another process to deal with.  People say it's just like cash, well why not just use cash?".  My response to the cashier is "Bitcoin is as good as cash and better, why not just use bitcoin"?  yes yes, I can hear it now, people will argue that no one uses Bitcoin, that's why.  But I'm talking theoretically.  :)
Senator: "We don't know who these people are".  Say what?  These people are us, the people of the world.  I don't understand what he is referencing when he says "these people".  The creators?  Why does it matter?  That seems like a misunderstanding of bitcoin.  
Senator: "I'm not opposed to it as long as it has the backing and oversight of the federal government".  Well, then, we aren't talking about bitcoin anymore.  No one can control Bitcoin.  It sounds like a misunderstanding of Bitcoin. :)
Would have been interesting to see some Bitcoin ATM/BTM as well since people who only want to buy a few bitcoins might not want to go through the hassles of submitting ID to exchanges or meeting people from localbitcoin and would pay a small premium for the convenience of buying at the ATM/BTM.

On the topic of accountability, did he also imply that that people lost money from external factors like failed exchanges and other forms of theft due to no one being accountable for Bitcoin?  He says: "Talk to the people who got taken down by bitcoin, not the man...They get wiped out ... it can vanish tomorrow..it can get wiped out... you can't find it".   But there is accountability here.  The people who lost their clients' bitcoins are the ones accountable; just like Madoff and failed banks are accountable for wiping out their clients.  I think there are plenty of examples where people have also been taken down by the USD.  :)   So I don't think he has a valid point.

Thanks.  I haven't been able to login for over a day as well.

Here's a map of the supported States.  They are headquartered in California as well.

I also liked the interview with professional hacker Dan Kiminsky who said he tried hard to hack Bitcoin core but couldn't.  :)  It's not far fetched to believe that hackers around the world are trying to hack Bitcoin constantly. But yet, there hasn't been a known successful hack of Bitcoin core.  It's somewhat reassuring.  He calls it "a Be-eautilful system".   Kudos to the Bitcoin core dev team.

Yes, when I used them before, I used Interac (from Canada) to transfer money to my Coinbase Wallet and it would cost $2 for the deposit fee.  Then, I would click on the GDAX link at the bottom of the page and it logged me into Coinbase Exchange GDAX (same userid and password) automatically.  From Coinbase Exchange (GDAX), I then transferred the money from Coinbase Wallet to my Coinbase Exchange (GDAX) account and then bought bitcoins from the exchange with 0.25% market taker fee.  The fee is 0% if you are a market maker.  In other words, if you are placing an order to the order book that doesn't fill right away but gets filled later, then there is a 0% fee when your order is filled.  So using Coinbase Exchange was really cheap as long as I don't use Coinbase Wallet service to buy/sell bitcoins.

It shows on GDAX that the high of the day was $2,999.99.  If we set the precision in preferences on Bitcoinity to 6 digits, it will also say that the high was $2,999.99.
