I have also been thinking about doing a project like this if nobody else is doing it. If you are looking for a contributer, message me. Will have plenty of time starting April. I have meager python skills and experience
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:56:49
How about using Litecoin or any other coin? 
Your site looks really nice and the jerky too. I will order some!

Please don't get into crypto and get basic math skills

@_date: 2018-01-22 13:45:40
No, do sell at 11550, buy at 11000 in one hour and sell at 12000 by the end of day . But you have to figure out the Timezone by yourself

What happened to the unclaimed balances?

How did you find this post?
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:15:18
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:53
Look into litecoin
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:24:25
Had the same issue around the time of the performance problems. Since then I always double check with gdax/other exchanges.

I always thought the same but apparently it's not possible. Could anyone go into the specifics?

Ordering Pizza with it

Yeah, price relative to what? To apples?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:12:00
Okay, but how do you know people are buying on credit? That's like THE big no-no  for everyone on this subject right? Your response seems so generic. Sorry, no disrespect intended
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:50:02
Please share. That's pretty big news actually
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:50:03
There is only one address corresponding to the private key of password.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:32:24
Brilliant idea
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:23:20
You are a gambler. Stay away from btc as an investment and go to work
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:02:02
Could they inflate the theoretic amount of bitcoins over the 21 cap?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:19:11
Holy shit. I am about to go there too. Thanks dude for the heads up
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:16:44
You won't have any friends after this... Just don't do it. Carefully explain to your friends on how to buy/sell and monitor their portfolio and give them the tools to keep  themselves informed. The way I see it, either you hold crypto because you believe in it, in which case you just HODL. Or you just want to make some profit, but the markets are still too unstable for this, in my opinion. I don't know what kind of background you have but are you sure that you are able to manage their investments without a loss? If you make profit you are good but especially in crypto it is so easy to lose a lot of money. Just imagine what happens when the market falls. With your money it's easy. You can just HODL but with your friends money they will repeatedly asknyou for updates and if they see that you've lost 50% of their money they will want to sell immediately. Then you will not just have lost their money but probably also their friendship.

What is everyone talking about? I don't see no dip on coinbase and don't have access to gdax right now. Can anyone post a chart
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:59:44
Ledger worked wonders for me. I am hesitant to move it back to an exchange and big price movements don't even phase me anymore
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:06:40
The title is very misleading or rather just wrong.
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:20:54
I did a quick search I really think someone is trying to generate addresses. The first one is pretty well known as it is the key you get if you sha256 "1".
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:40:52
Check out "VCCY" on the terminal
@_date: 2019-02-02 12:28:18
As of now I am really just hosting my node to support the cause and experiment. To my understanding, there is not enough traffic yet and fees are still way too low to make any money. LNBIG makes apparently approx. 5 $ a month and this guys channels are massive.
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:57:13
I never said that it would make sense. Just check the entries in that list. Every private key can be generated by using the first column number.
@_date: 2019-02-12 12:23:30
Sorry, completely forgot. I am looking for Base58 format keys.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:31:10
And how is it possible that the Litecoin price still changes even though all transactions for ltc are deactivated?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:47:50
The general public doesn't know what futures are. This is just an entry gate for big money people
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:21:01
Easier to brute force
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:06:07
There are services which create custom addresses for you. And because some figures at a certain position are fixed, you severely limit the range of possible addresses. But then again, I am no expert on this matter.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:23:22
But coinbase is just one market, right?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:09:33
I had already 2 Pi's die on me or rather the SD card. Don't do it
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:06:58
Well there might be some correlation here
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:05:21
You are crazy
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:24:09
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:07:15
I feel like they are trying to create a panic sell wave at 8000 and then buy in themselves at the dip
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:00:08
If that's your version of a dip... Oh boy, brace yourself
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:39:34
If coins are really lost forever, does it even make a difference ? Why should they be priced in? The degree to which bitcoins can be split is so much smaller than just your average fiat currency. Lost coins to date shouldn't really be priced in right? Unless you are pricing in the risk of lost coins resurfacing ? Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:41:27
I think he means fiat money
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:21:05
Ideally, nobody loses during an exchange.  Selling person gets fiat liquidity or just wants to realize returns while the buying person gets Bitcoin for investment purposes or Bitcoin as a currency. A rational person wouldn't sell/buy if the current price doesn't reflect the adequate personal value estimate.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:08:31
Luckily I didn't use it for Bitcoin

Just use excel next time ;)
Without fees though
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:21:37
Uhm yeah but the web based equivalent? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:01:48
Go ahead please
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:00:15
Aaaah,my bad. Didn't read your post correctly. But direct banks like cortal Consors should still work. Opened my account while living in Japan
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:08:17
Maybe because people can't transfer their Fiat money to the exchanges? So people can only sell. Just a guess though
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:45:03
Why do you have to wait? I get my btc instantly O.o
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:52:30
What's your problem? I never said it was excel? I just told him to use excel next time and offered him my solution not in excel...
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:29:15
Great article! Really confirmed what I guessed for certain countries
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:05:48
Try using the app
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:56:40
You can. A lot of Erasmus students do this.

Most boring past few days since ever. Something is coming
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:16:46
Lucky you. My father just got fired and the only funds I have are in Bitcoin. So glad I still have my 0.14 BTC. Seriously, btc is the best thing to happen. So many people getting rich or just getting some extra cash. Without it I would have to quit my studies immediately. Now I at least have some time to come up with a plan. Congrats man
Also, delete your post ASAP :D
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:48:14
Less wallstreetbets/trump-esque posts. Seriously, sometimes I get the feeling that only 12 year olds are on this sub

Honestly, I think brexit will not happen mainly due to the backstop

Where is this data from?

You can make money with LN nodes? I didn't know
@_date: 2019-01-31 21:14:20
I checked [ and my node seems to be running. I really have no idea about servers etc. I just want to get it running to build my own blockchain explorer. Can you recommend anyways on how I could find out whether on of the above error sources does apply? Or any very through guide on how to set it up?
