 Been there. Found so many exchanges that claimed to cover US but, in fact, had limitations and worked in several states only.

 This GIF is not relevant at the moment as the crypto market is experiencing stabilization and calm. Bitcoin price is not that much volatile. Bears are on firm ground but there's no panic sale on the market. Crypto will definitely grow, but the question is when exactly.

 Try CEX (r/ then. They charge comparably low fees. By the way, the company has recently reduced fees for buying btc via Visa/MasterCard. Or try bank transfers, it's usually a cheaper method.

 It's a common practice already. The exchanges which allow buying bitcoins with cards will ask for a lot of documents before performing transactions. That's a security measure and a requirement of their policy. I can't say anything about LocalBitcoin 'cause I'm using CEX (r/ It's possible to buy crypto with dc/cc or wire but the company will ask to provide some documents. I think it's because they collaborate with banks that demand such measures.

 Alternatively, you could try CEX for making payments via credit/debit cards. Also, consider wire transfers which should be more convenient. By the way, the company fully updated this feature: r/

 I think it is not the security that makes bitcoin valuable. Its value lies in the possibility to reach an agreement without intermediaries. And it's not that much about economy or the price of the coin, but about the technical features which it introduces.

 It is one of the examples of the rapid expansion of bitcoin payment options. In addition to over 2,300 bitcoin ATMs that already exist in the USA, there are 100,000 other cash machines that now also offer buying bitcoin. What a great news for all the crypto enthusiasts! But the residents of the US are surely the luckiest.

 You only have to wait less than a year. But here’s another question – are you sure that parents will allow you to buy crypto after you turn 18? If you're worried about legal aspects only – crypto is in the grey zone and is hardly controlled by the government. You can actually buy crypto right now. But if you don’t want to argue with your parents, then wait a little. I think, the market won't change radically.

 The opportunity to buy crypto with a credit card is available on cex. I used this payment method before and everything went smoothly. Besides, in August tried to make a deposit using wire transfer (I heard info about their new conditions of wires and got interested, r/ and it turned out to be convenient too.

 About the principle of selling Bitcoin: the market works like a large ecosystem where all sellers and buyers are in the same conditions. When you want to sell BTC, another trader wants to buy it. Exchanges like Coinbase facilitate this process and make deals faster. 
Such websites connect traders, so you don’t have to search on your own. With a lot of traders who want to sell BTC, the price will decrease. It’s all about traditional balance between demand and supply.  Now, about your problem with selling BTC via Coinbase. For Canada, they may allow purchasing but not selling. So, you might want to look for other exchanges. Check QuadrigaCX, the largest Canadian marketplace, or the worldwide platform CEX. The latter has convenient Bitcoin calculator, by using it, you can check the price easily: r/ 
Also, you can look at LocalBitcoins where traders are connected thanks to the P2P algorithm. Finally, you can search for ATMs and retail shops near you, they are popular in the US and maybe, there are some in Canada, too.
