The model has it's merits for explaining the historic price of bitcoin - and many other non-cashflow assets.  I believe the general concept is valid for explaining the upward value of Bitcoin in the past - and might explain future upward value (although we haven't seen that for a couple of years now).
Recognize this is simply a 'best fit' regression against the historical data.  As a professional forecaster (for product sales), I can make these type of backward regressions that accurately fit the past with near perfection - then extrapolate the equation into the future for one period (say a month), place orders, and find out it was wildly wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME even though the past fit has a R2 value of 0.97.....  If I add this new data point (which was grossly unpredicted by the equation) to my data set - and rebuild my regression, you'd be surprised how different my new equation is with just one additional data point.  Or it might not change much, just the R2 value drops.
Going on and on with the technicals won't help much - just know that historical best fits don't always (actually rarely) predict the future.  If they did,  historians would be the richest folks on the planet.
PS - I listened to a Plan B interview - and one thing I did find interesting is that when he uses just the first few years of data in the model - it more accurately predicts what 'happened' afterward (better fit) than when he uses all of the historical data to build the equation.  That was very interesting for me to hear.

You’re on the cusp of learning the difference between ‘printing money’ and facilitating credit.  Contrary to the mantra of money printing on this sub, central banks ‘loan’ money they don’t have (they buy up bonds with IOU’s ).  ALL of the money ‘printed’ is owed back to the central bank when the bonds they purchase mature.

I'm 10 years younger - the way I see my current savings is that I've got the two kids colleges covered (they are 3 and 10 right now), and now I'm growing my actual retirement funds.  Was going over the finances with my wife - she thought we had a lot of money until I pointed out what 4 years of college costs, times 2.  Then she realized we are only beginning our retirement savings.
Good for you - you've done well.  I hope I continue to make substantial progress over the next 10 yrs.  If my wife returns to work it will 'supercharge' our ability to invest more.

I have one theory that we are simply in the final leg down/correction from the 2017 high which will bottom out somewhere below $3k.
It’s one plausible theory based on the price action/charts.  Basically an A-B-C correction.  A being the $3k low, B being the $14k high, and C being somewhere below B ($3k).
I have several other theories, and my theories plus $1 might get you a cup of coffee.
It can go pretty low.  Only time will tell.

While I agree with the general premise that the 'stock to flow' model is missing a critical demand piece of the equation - I'm not sure you actually made this argument.
Here are two contradictory statements:
" Couch potatoes do not add value "
I respectfully beg to differ.  I believe it IS the couch potatoes that add almost all of the value.  If everyone sold their btc or gold tomorrow the price would drop tremendously.  The couch potatoes (or hodlrs) are one of the primary demand sources.  As you point out - fully 60% of the BTC historical demand has been by hodlrs.  Only 40% is moving around.  If that other 60% starts moving around - price will tank quickly.
" Furthermore, BTC buyers don’t have to buy from miners as as any BTC holder is free to sell "
Exactly my point above.  The price of BTC is, and will be, primarily determined by the selling activity of the BTC holders.  As long as they continue to hodl, and if more buy and hold, then it's price continues upward.
Final point - I don't believe that BTC even needs to be able to make direct transactions like a traditional currency to maintain and grow in value.  It just needs to be convertible into other securities/currencies.  Many valuable assets do not have vibrant markets other than the act of buying and selling the asset (think gold again - very little utility).
It seems that you are too focused on viewing BTC as purely a currency as opposed to an asset (digital gold).

\- Building nuclear/biological weapons
\- Human trafficking
\- Weapon sales (The US/DOJ/CIA leads this market for illicit weapons sales)
All of these same types of activities can be performed using cold hard cash (remember the US/CIA sending pallets of cash to Iran - assume to provide kickbacks for some illicit activity).  Sometimes entities are cut off from the financial system for the right reasons - often it's complete BS.  
It's definitely a grey area.  I just recognize that to some degree I could be helping some bad global actors do some bad things just a little bit easier because of the liquidity I help provide.  Same can certainly be argued about cash.....

Very good thoughts.  
At current adoption, as both store of value and currency usage, btc has proven to be a real player.
My personal take is that it will function as ‘digital gold’ moreso than a digital currency - although the lines blur.  I don’t necessarily think it requires mass adoption to be successful in this regard.  After all very few own physical gold but everyone recognizes the value.  I think that is the future of bitcoin.

There's no supply 'shock' when it's a planned reduction in supply.  It's known, understood, and driving the supply/demand today.  Not saying that it won't increase after the halving (or before, or never) - but efficient market hypothesis would indicate this halving is fully priced into BTC.

10 btc too much of my hard earned savings to diversify into this high risk, potentially high reward investment.  If I had enough to put 5% of my portfolio to buy 10 btc,I would already have $1.8 million, probably wouldn’t buy btc and just retire with plenty of safer investments.  I could really be kicking myself in the ass in 10 years for being too cautious, but at least I should still be able to retire if btc goes to zero or finds a homeostasis point of $250.

I'm sure it's just as good as the models which predicted an ice free arctic ocean by 2008 or Glacier National Park being ice free by 2020 (they had to quietly start taking down the signs throughout the park this year).
The nice things about these predictions is that you can ride on them for quite some time before it becomes obvious they are flawed.  And by then everyone has forgotten.
I've read the STF model by plan b.  It's certainly interesting - however I think it described what happened past tense better than it will describe the future of btc.  Don't get me wrong - I'm bullish on BTC over the long term, I just don't think plan b carries much weight - it's just another (of many) predictions.

My 2 cents.  I recently diversified 7.5% of my portfolio to btc.  Price drops don’t do much to my overall portfolio other than occasionally buy a little more when rebalancing.  It doesn’t bother me as I do think the longer term upside is worth it.  Because btc is a high risk-highly volatile-potential high reward, my plan is to allow it to grow to 33% (assuming we get another big rally) before I start taking chips off the table.  When it susequently crashes, I will allow it to fall back to 7.5% before I rebalance into btc.  
Benefits are owning some actual btc, just like i own some physical precious metals and I even have some physical cash on hand (each about 1% of my portfolio) so if the shtf I can grab a few grand and my btc wallet and get out of dodge.

You can PM me.  I would enjoy to hear your concerns.  I have plenty, but that applies to any asset class I own including real estate etc, gold, silver, commodities, stock, bonds (in multiple denominations).  I’m not sure there is anything 100% safe, other than diversifying in (hopefully) uncorrelated assets.
I think your concern about the dollar devaluing by hyper inflation might be overblown.  Remember that all this ‘printing’ is actually loaning.  Every single dollar is owed back to the fed.   Inability to repay will more likely be deflationary.  There would need to be an active political decision to eliminate the current system and just have the treasury print freely.....

Yes, I believe it could be banned - in the US.  I’m concerned we could see some insane volatility creating a massive bubble and burst.  Triggering a massive recession and so many personal fortunes wiped out I could easily see the new Socialist breed simply banning it.  Along with many other exotic (or no so exotic) financial instruments. 
As for value, it’s a guessing game.  My guess is that it has already dropped in value at this point in my scenario.  so from a low point with a relatively intact global market, eventually it will soar again.

The mantra stock to flow is overly simplistic with regard to valuation, that’s where I’m going.  The idea that current price does not assume future supply constraints is faulty at every level.  In the case of gold, for example, some folks are assuming it will be worthless in the future due to astroid mining to folks who believe we are about to mine our last ounce.  All of those oppinions (the only ones that matter have $$’s taking a position), create the current market value of gold.  The current price of bitcoin, by default, is pricing in halvings, bitcoin losses, various adoption rates, you name it.  All of those different valuations create the current market price.

My opinion - and I'm new to watching this market as I recently diversified a small portion of my portfolio to bitcoin
It's gonna make a low below $3.4k in order to finish up the correction from the 2017 high.  I think we're in the final leg down of the correction.  The previous drop to $3.5k was just the first leg of the correction.  Then rise to $12.5k, now we need to make a new floor.  It's the old A-B-C corrective wave form.  A was the low at $3.5k, B was the high at $12k, C will be somewhere below $3.5k.
If I'm correct, we've got awhile until we hit new ATH's.
This makes total sense based on the fact I made my initial investment at $8.5k
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:34:08
On aggregate don’t kid yourself.  Very few btc get trade (as a percent of total).  97% of the purchases went to hodlers (speculators)

The simple fact we are discussing the impact of halving on price explicitly means, it’s priced in.  I’m not telling you the price is correct (whatever that means because the price is the price) but it is the sum valuation by all players in the market for the net present value of btc.

My best guess is that by the time (if ever) stocks are quoted in BTC - BTC prices will have somewhat stabilized. 
You're point emphasizes why stocks, and most things, will not be quoted in BTC until the price stabilizes.  Wildly swinging valuation makes BTC VERY unpractical to use as a 'currency'.  I could leave the house with enough money to buy a car - get to the car lot and be down 20% and unable to afford what I left the house for......  Hence why it won't be adopted, in general, as a currency until stabilization (if ever) occurs.  Until then, and possibly always, BTC will function as digital gold.  And same with gold - we don't use it as a 'currency' but more as a store of value.

I own much more gold and real estate than btc.  That being said, i don’t view either with the potential appreciation (or depreciation) prospects as btc.   If you’re not in the market, you can’t benefit (or loose).   To me, btc is a highly speculative small portion of my portfolio.  The managed scarcity of btc isn’t going away.  Potential for insane valuations (and subsequent collapses) is very possible imho.

The SF Model is worth 'something' but the world is not this simplistic.  As the author of this article points out - there is a demand side of the equation also.
Let me use an  example of something with limited supply - LAND.
Based on the SF model - land should be absolutely astronomical at this point - everywhere.  The flow is essentially zero (no new land is being produced, I guess you could argue about volcanic islands being formed......).  Yet land prices vary from astronomical to almost free depending upon the desirability of that land.  The desirability of that land is highly psychological (beach front property highly desirable even though it gets wiped out by mother nature on a regular basis).
Bottom line - the SF model is overly simplistic against the real world.  There is an entire demand side of the equation which is very real and constantly changing.  With regard to BTC you must also take into account the alternatives.  There are many other asset classes to invest in, there are also better crypto currencies (opinions will be many).  
All of that said - the SF model is just a long hand version of stating that scarcity was built into the BTC code from the beginning.  Without the scarcity (halvings), BTC would likely be completely worthless.
It will ultimately be your choice as to whether to invest in BTC or not.  I'm of the opinion that it will go up high - very high - but I'm in for the long haul and only playing with a small portion (less than 10%) of my total portfolio.

I’m in the mole category.
1) Bitcoin is $$ now.   Whether it’s used for daily transaction is not relevant.  Apple stock is not used for daily tranactions, but it is readily interchangeable with $$’s.
2) Bitcoin is designed to create increasing scarcity.
So unless point 1 falls apart (btc getting legally banned or something along those lines), I believe it’s value will grow tremendously, and with extreme volatility to constantly shake out the market.  I wouldn’t be surprised if btc rises to $100k and then falls to $1k before again rising again.

If the recession is liquidity driven, like 08/09, then btc will fall in price just like gold did.  Folks need cash and everything liquid gets substantial selling pressure.  Cash (fiat) would be king.

Look at 2008 up close.  You're data is accurate - for the year it did show a small gain.  But from the beginning of the year it rose to over $1k/oz and then the chaos hit - dropped pretty hard for several months down to a low of just over $700/oz - 30% fall from high to low.  It moved down along with most other financial assets downwards, although less than some assets.  I lived it real time.  Thought it was a great hedge against stocks - until it wasn't.

IMHO - I believe your method of future projection to be more accurate.  I believe that each halving will have less and less impact, each ATH smaller growth than the one prior.  I assume this is all being priced into the current value of BTC and over time the pricing of BTC will mature accordingly.

You got it, time will tell.  And I believe that time is on my hodling side.  These rapid movements are a lot of fun to watch and theorize about, but I’ve noticed that the communities price predictions are horrible at best.

Good luck bro.  I always stayed with options, never wanted to be on the hook for more than my investment (although I’ve bought rental property with a mortgage, same as leverage).  I was able to turn $2k into $50k in around 6 months with just straight options.  I was also able to loose $40k of that in the subsequent three months.  At least I had $10k left to buy a real nice guitar, and made consistent extra hundred bucks a week for 20 years playin music. 
You’ll do well if you stick at it.  Just recognize your initial statement is very factual, TA works until it doesn’t.  I’ve done fine saving and investing over the susequent decades without trying to time markets cuz I learned that I just can’t do it consistently.  Some can.
This is also my take on investing in btc.  I put 7.5% of my portfolio in.  When it dropz, I’ll buy to maintain that 7.5%.  Only thing I will treat differently than my other assets is that I won’t sell any btc until it exceeds 33% of my portfolio.
@_date: 2019-10-22 17:49:42
Probably sell 2 and rebalance my portfolio accordingly.

I would argue that it has benefit in the food industry (of which I’m a part of).  Material traceability and eliminates any ability to fudge the data retroactively.  In my example keeping milk supply allocated to various cheeses.  Already done with walmart/produce.

Actually this is what made me diversify a portion on my $$ into BTC.  I don't assume we'll remain this high - and purchasing more at this high price is a concern to me.

Coinbase charged ne between 1-2% to buy.  I’m assuming it’s same on back end for selling.  Round trip should be less than 4%

@_date: 2019-12-24 17:16:39
I don't think it would impact the btc market at all.  It's still easier and cheaper to go into a convenience store and buy an amazon gift card for somebody to use vs buy somebody btc and explain how to use it to shop on amazon.  Secondly, I personally, won't be spending my btc on amazon - I own it for investment purposes.
Bottom line is that I don't ever foresee BTC being an easily useable and widely adopted currency for such small purchases.  I believe it will function more as digital gold in the arena.  I gold widely relevant?  Of course.  Can you spend it on amazon or buy a cup of coffee with it - not really.

Everything you named happened after 1971 happened before also.  Banks charged fees, banks went bust, etc....   Bottom line is that banks do loan savings (+ the feeshly created loans).  To not pay back loans is stealing morally..  Legally It’s breaking a contract.
Some of your other civil disobedience measures I dig.
I believe if you want to practice civil disobedience you shouldn’t borrow.  One has it largely within their own control to invite debt slavery into their life.

Yep, I choose both.  I’m weighted 4 to 1 stocks to bitcoin.  (however stocks and btc only make up one third of my portfolio - need to throw in some bonds, commodities, real estate, and precious metals to finish up)

Only 'the moon' is still up.  Everyone else seems to be down (ivan on tech, dadadash, sunny decree?, and a few more).  To me this is standard operating procedure for youtube on content they want to suppress.  If the content you are interested in is being targeted for suppression by youtube - you are directly over the target.  This is confirmation to me that the powers that be want to shut down spreading of info on btc.

And gamblers anonymous is strengthened by putting all you have into that one winner!  
I get your point that many of the wealthiest acquired it with laser like focus - but that focus was often on something they personally invented or controlled.  Not by betting on a single security or currency that they have as much control over it's value as they have control over the weather.
So if you have a great invention or company that you've started, focus like a laser.

So you are recommending that people who take out a loan NOT pay it back?  
I don't remember when Adam Smith recommended such reckless behaviour?
This is called theft - plain and simple - whether you borrowed in fiat, btc, gold, or your neighbor's sheep which you promised to return at a later date.

It's based on a complex algorithm of time value.  Essentially - right after I purchase bitcoin, the price will need to drop.

Youtube has been taking down content from other communities I follow.  This just seems to be in line with the trajectory.  If I'm interested in the topic - youtube will smash it and try their damndest to suppress the good content in the search results and systematically strike content creators with strikes with no explanation.  I'm very sorry this has happened to you.

\ is as fake as a $3 bill.  BTC is potentially the least anonymous way to make monetary transactions that has ever been invented.  A PUBLIC ledger containing every transaction and the ledger is duplicated, it can never be erased or adjusted.

My best estimate is that first you will see big ticket items expressed in btc terms.  I don't foresee anytime in the near future when you think of a coffee in btc terms.
This is similar to my experience living around the world.  In countries with less stable currencies, often big ticket items (like cars and houses) were quoted and priced in USD as opposed to the local currency.  
I expect the same thing to happen globally with regard to BTC.  Houses, cars, and maybe even high end smartphones will be the first items that folks discuss the price in BTC.
