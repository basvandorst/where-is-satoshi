I think it will be the normal shitshow we have all come to expect from this band of losers. This show is funded by big media, and as such the message will be overwhelmingly against BTC. My guess is Cooper snarkily berates curly-hair short guy for 15 minutes after sinking an irrational amount of cash into BTC only to see it magically disappear. It will be just as irritating as any other episode, and will serve only to insult anyone with more than a high school education.

I gotta say, I think the OP is very correct. There seems to be a growing amount of noise regarding bitcoin, and it's potential. I have heard the whole spectrum from folks who are convinced that bitcoin is gonna be the thing to use after the oil-dollar crashes into a burning fiery pit, and I have heard others who see it as just another upstart organization that has a a bunch of people duped. In order for this thing to really take off, and I mean for every blue haired old grandma to know as much about it as hardcore cyber-punk sk8t3rs, you need plasticity. Yes, there *has* to be a core of individuals who care about how and why the thing works, but the end-user, your customer base at the generic level isn't going to give a hoot in hell about how or why it works, they just want their purchasing power.
