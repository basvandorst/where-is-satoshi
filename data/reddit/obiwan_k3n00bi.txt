Hyperbole on my part, but I think you understand what I was trying to say.

I honestly can't unless they essentially go all out investing in the Bitcoin infrastructure with BTC.
Funding Bitcoin based start-ups with BTC may be the best way, but it's their money and they can/will do as they please.

Less about fairness and more about general economic health of a currency. If 25%+ of a currency is essentially just sat on it isn't too encouraging for people to adopt it.

They have almost 100% of the purchasing power and with widespread adoption of Bitcoin they would essentially rule the world.
To me that's less than ideal and goes against what many people claim Bitcoin could be (a more democratic currency).
edit: also bad Bitcoin PR. They aren't particularly encouraged to use their money, just watch it grow in value. Not a sign of a healthy currency (though I'm no economist).

In regards to your second point, yes, the value of a full 'coin' is completely psychological, but that will not change how the average person views it. It has to be a process and shifting the presentation to help that process along may be a place to start. Wasn't that the entire idea of the (not entirely adopted) shift to mBTC?

This is exactly true. People (in general) are dumb. I guess this was the overall issue I hadn't quite gotten together yet.
People need a way of thinking of Bitcoin as something they can use to benefit themselves. As of now, it just seems as an alternative currency or a way for other people to benefit.

Fair enough. Again, I'm not an economist, just bringing up my concerns.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:27:37
Yes, but that system wasn't really attempting to compete in the same way Bitcoin is today.

I actually didn't even think of certain addresses being associated with those larger coin pools, thank you for mentioning that. But the lack of clarity is still bad PR for Bitcoin and a potential turn off to potential adopters.

It clearly hasn't, but I can certainly see it scaring other people off.
Some people already claim it to be a scam, this could be (wrongly) used as evidence to support that idea.
