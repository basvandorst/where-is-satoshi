A company not providing goods purchased and not refunding is theft. The fact that they did refund him just says that they didn't steal **his** deposit. 
This is just news, a notification. This isn't appreciation or depreciation.

They would have never got the key anyway. The hackers have the coin, it's not in Escrow, they have no incentive to do anymore work.

an empty gun pointed at your head has the same effect as a loaded one. 
Ransomware is not a business, it's a digital kidnapping. If the hackers are smart they'll know that keeping this operation running will increase their likelihood of getting caught.

I believe there's confusion between blame and negligence/ignorance. **In this case** the victim is responsible for their own asset's security, the consequences of neglecting to backup ones wallet/important &amp; confidential files are that of the victims' (this extends to not only malware attacks but harddrive failures/losses too).
It is very possible that the victim is simply ignorant over the danger of holding such a large amount of assets in one place without a method or recovery, after all, people don't usually start backing up files until after they (or someone they know) have a major data loss indecent.
This does not mean that they are to blame for being attacked and absolutely do not lose any victims' rights. It is unlikely that they were targeted specifically, (seeing that the malware has blocked access to the funds that would pay the ransom.) 
the victim has simply gotten very unlucky, but you cannot deny that they would be slightly less unlucky if they had implemented better security and backup measurements.
