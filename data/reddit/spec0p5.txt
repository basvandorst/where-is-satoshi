Bitcoin is my life pretty much has been now for 6 years. My girlfriend loves to hear me talk about it. I probably do go on about it a little too much at times though.

So they're advertising the fact that they got decimated by this bull run?

Bigger blocks will increase the size of the blockchain thus increasing the hardware requirements for full nodes. 
This means that eventually the number of full node operators will decline, which decreases security through less decentralisation. 
The best methods I’ve seen so far to combat this is using Masternodes to incentivise full node operators. Or of course the options I would hope most investors in this space are aware of, Lightning network and Segwit. We will just have to wait and see which option the market prefers. So far it seems that the market prefers the Lightning network approach.

It doesn't work that way. The market cap is merely based off of the last price paid for 0.00000001 - 1 BTC on an exchange. This is why markets can move so fast in either direction with volumes lower than 10% of the market cap of said asset/stock/token.
