This analysis is completely on point.  VC needs a minimum expectation of a 10x cash out over 4-8 yr to make an investment. This is due to power law distribution of their returns (1 big winner gains must exceed 9 duds and losers).  Unless you can scale big and fast companies can't justify the VC valuation and get wound down. This is also why there is so much pressure from VC backed Bitcoin firms to scale block size to support massive transaction growth.  These firms operate on a winner-take-all mentality whereby if they are the first to achieve scale, they capture the market, establish a moat, and justify the VC investment.
In my opinion, this is fundamentally counter to the foundational principle of decentralization in Bitcoin. Reasonable differences in the long term vision of Bitcoin aside, implicit VC valuation pressure is likely driving much of the block size debate.

It feels nothing like Mt. Gox. Gox wires were delayed for everyone including you until someone else's big deposit hit, unless you begged Tux to push it through on IRC. The trading engine and site was a PHP joke. There was a 15% BTC premium on Gox cause everyone knew it was the only way to get funds off collapse. I was sweating hard for months trying to get money off Gox, eventually succeeded.
Coinbase holds over a million BTC, has a huge valuation from real USD investors (not made up numbers from crypto valuations), and smoothly processes the vast majority of wires. Best in the business. Storing funds there is probably safer than holding their own keys for most people.

There is almost nobody calling this one a scam in the bitcoin community, though that is hardly an indication of something not being a scam; the bitcoin community is *mostly* filled with people clueless about finance.  With this sort of stuff, you really need to do your own due diligence. To me, it looks like an awesome product and opportunity, albeit with some regulatory risk.  
I think I'm the first to come up with the recycling IPO into betting idea, a discussion about it is [here]( but its tricky to prove/disprove. The site owner is [well-known]( and one of the biggest bitcoin advocates and serial entrepreneurs.  The whale bettors seem to be washing their coins prior to betting, and there are plenty of other plausible ideas, including the one that pirateat40 is the one doing all the betting with the coins he stole in the BS&amp;T scheme. The big bets also started right after the owner came back from a trip meeting with casino owners in Macau, so it could be some of them testing the system. 
The global gambling industry had [$419 billion in revenue]( in 2011. I think its plausible that after 6 months of existence, with its global reach and its logistical advantages, Satoshi Dice has captured 0.001% of the market.

You already know that the correct answer is wrong when you asked your question?
MPEX has over 10x the volume and liquidity of all the other sites combined.  It has been around for much longer than all the other sites.  It is the only site that is secured by GPG encryption.  Use any others at your peril.  How many times do people need to get hacked to understand the GPG is the ONLY acceptable answer to security?

I just got off the phone with a litigator friend who looked at the contract and who says :
1) CoinLab's main counsel (Susman Godfrey, not their local Seattle counsel) is a pretty famous and good firm that does a lot of contingency work.  CoinLab's lack of money implies that the case is on contingency, and that implies that a good law firm thinks that suing is worth their time and effort, and those firms typically get 20-40% of any settlement.  
2) There is no way for us to clearly evaluate the complaint this early in the litigation process even looking at the contract.

Not a counter, I just think some people are trustworthy.  Would be surprising if Mike ran off with 50,000BTC now when it would have been very tempting already long ago.  But there is the counterparty risk of course, just like Just-Dice, or MPEX taking your coins.  But I trust the operators of those two sites as well after years of experience with them and a proven track record of competency.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:48:56
1) Dooglas's ID and physical location are known to large investors. Obviously if he disappears, that info will be made public.
2) The web of trust is not designed to be a numerical score that you use to evaluate the trustworthiness of someone, it is designed so that you can see who trusts that person, and by association, you can decide if they are trustworthy.  It requires considerable critical analysis, and a default attitude of trust-nobody, as does most bitcoin 'investing'.
3) Generally speaking, investing in unregistered virtual securities is a known bad idea. Anyone who issues them is committing a crime.  You are counting on the SEC not having the manpower, motivation or jurisdiction to arrest and charge the issuers, or that you can get in and out before the opportunity goes bust. Bitcoin 'investments' have a half-life of about 4 months. That's why I stay away from all this crap. Holding coin in your own wallet is the only viable long-term investment at this time.
4) I certainly relate to your pain.  Unfortunately, losing a significant number of coins is sort of a prerequisite for learning the appropriate level of caution for most people, myself included.

This post is wrong and quite paranoid. 
For a &gt;$10,000 wire into your BofA account, you might get have a brief hold on your funds, but it is unlikely. Anything over 10k will be reported, but there is nothing wrong with being reported, as you are not doing anything illegal. Wires of this size are flying around ALL THE TIME.
When you file your taxes, get a CPA, determine a tax interpretation of Bitcoin that has some legal basis and stick to it when filing.  If the IRS issues guidance on Bitcoin prior to filing, use their interpretation. As long as you are acting consistently and in good faith on issues where guidance has not yet been given, you may be subject to a tax adjustment but not to penalties.
Getting a good CPA should cost less than $1,000.  Paying taxes will be between 20-39% + state on your gains depending on your bracket (which will be above the 15% bracket due to your bitcoin gains in that year).

It's not backing a "high-yield" fund in the sense of the many ponzi schemes floated over the past year.  It pays out the dividends to the investors.  The creator owns 90% of the company and he sold 10% to the public. There has been a few addresses that have been making many [crazy huge bets]( over last month (&gt;500,000BTC this month).
The IPO provides some of the backing capital to allow the house to have such high betting limits.
I have speculated (with zero evidence) that the IPO proceeds are being funneled into the betting to raise bet volumes and increase the share value.  There is a [100BTC bounty]( set by the owner of the bitcoin stock exchange that listed S.DICE if someone can prove that this is, or is not the case.  The creator of S.DICE has offered to split the prize if you can devise a way for him to prove that he is not betting on his own site with the IPO money.

31. During the relevant period, Shavers obtained at least 700,467 BTC in principal investments from BTCST investors
32. During the relevant period, Shavers returned at least 507,148 BTC to BTCST investors as withdrawals or purported interest payments.
24. In August 2012, as the scheme collapsed, Shavers made **preferential redemptions to friends and longtime BTCST investors**.

An additional note on volumes.  There was 537,375 coins in betting volume in December.  The house got lucky and made 17,266 coins (3.2% return vs. 1.9% expected value).
Betting volume has continued to increase this month.  There have been over [140,000BTC bet]( since midnight Jan 1st.  If that pace keeps up (seems impossible, but so did 500,000 coins / month volume until this month), you are looking at around 31 days /2.5 days *140,000BTC * 0.019 profit = 32,984 BTC expected profit for Jan.    Of course that is only if betting volume stays this insanely high.

If you send to multiple betting addresses in the same transaction, you get the same 'lucky number' for each bet, making it essentially a single bet with a higher limit and the possibility of partial payout if your number falls between the cutoffs of the addresses you bet to.

Cyprus bail-in on March 17th marks the moment the last bubble ignited.  Within 3 weeks we went from $50 to $266.
Remember [this quote]( 




If there is a risk in a bank, our first question should be 'Okay, what are you in the bank going to do about that? What can you do to recapitalise yourself?'. If the bank can't do it, then we'll talk to the shareholders and the bondholders, we'll ask them to contribute in recapitalising the bank, and if necessary *the uninsured deposit holders*.
If we want to have a healthy, sound financial sector, the only way is to say, 'Look, there where you take on the risks, you must deal with them, and if you can't deal with them, then you shouldn't have taken them on'.
The consequences may be that it's the end of story, and that is an approach that I think, now that we are out of the heat of the crisis, we should take."

So… They either got a deposit of $20MM that they have not acquired coins with yet, or they bought 30,000 BTC in an OTC transaction, or a typo or what?

This is total vaporware. Read the quotes carefully.
"Coinlab has worked for a year to sign an exclusive long term deal with Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox."
"The goal is to move customers’ money from overseas to Silicon Valley Bank by March 22nd."
Mt. Gox has not announced a deal. Coinlab has only said they are trying to do a deal.  Coinlab's original business plan was to somehow [monitize MMO gamers via bitcoin mining]( That is a totally different focus than what the current story is discussing, which is a bad sign for a startup.
I suspect that coinlab has burnt thru most of their funding without having launched any products, and are now desperately trying to get some press for another funding round before they go under.
Mt.Gox is doing &gt;$40MM in volume a month.  Why would they sell 80% of their book to an unfocused startup that used to have $500k in total funding at the beginning of last year?  Why hasn't Mt.Gox said anything about this?  Why would Coinlab piss off Mt.Gox with a unilateral press leak if a deal was actually going to happen? 
To me, this story reads like Coinlab is about to disappear.
Edit: Looking less like vaporware now.

Details from Entropy on bitcointalk...
Last fall Roman claimed he was hacked.  He had all of the bitcoin on deposit at Bitfloor in 1 hot wallet, and 25 000 Bitcoin were gone.  Instead of going bankrupt, he decided to lock all of the bitcoins on account there as 'Held' and continue operating.
If you had bitcoin with Roman on that day, you became an unwilling creditor to Roman on his terms, where were, and are: I will pay you back someday, maybe, and you get no interest, and I won't allow trading of my debts.  To date, he has made one tiny payment and has not committed to any schedule to pay the remainder back.  In fact, he will never be able to pay 25000 bitcoin back, unless the price crashes.
There has been no proof provided of the supposed hack.
People continue to trade bitcoins on his site every day.  I'm sure they will be shocked when their is another 'security breach' and all their money is gone.  Or FinCEN shows up and shuts Bitfloor down and all their money is held for 4 years while the lawyers sort things out and carve their fees out of the money on deposit.
