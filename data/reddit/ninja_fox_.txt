Its also a whole lot more likely that I will lose my money with bitcoins. One slip up and im fucked.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:13:42
They pushed the problem further down the road. A bigger block size means you can handle more transactions but requires more storage space and network speeds. If bcash was handling the worlds transactions you would be downloading hundreds of GB per day to keep up with the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:06:47
No it wouldn't because there is absolutely nothing stopping people from watching it and not reporting it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:17:03
Any process running as the same user as you can steal your coins anyway. Most current OSs were not designed to protect programs from the same user from touching each other.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:32:42
That's a big assumption.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:51:05
It isn't practical 
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:04:28
You can't do that with a blockchain. The data is duplicatable. I can create 1000 copies of the block chain that say I have 10000 bitcoins but its useless because I can't convince others that my chain is real. For movies I don't care about convincing the world I own it I only care about being able to view it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:33:03
It won't because you can't make any change without a fork.

@_date: 2017-12-22 02:50:59
Speeding up the block rate is the same problem. We don't want more transactions in the blockchain because it gets too big and no one can keep up.

How is the public key matched with the address to see if the private key is correct? Is the public key sent in the transaction and rehashed by the miners to see if it matches?

The buying part is very true. In my country the only seller is still selling for &gt;$500 and requires extensive identification. so I have no real way to get bitcoins. I would love to start buying bitcoins and join in with all of you guys but there is no way for me to get started at the moment.

Wikipedia doesn't want to take bitcoins directly. They use coinbase so there bitcoins can be turned into USD automaticly. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 10:36:24
Ah, thanks that clears it up. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:09:42
Wouldn't sending coins to the wallet put the address on the block chain anyway? 
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:53:10
@_date: 2014-12-23 08:48:07
Well you could always use a client that does this automatically. Its a bit harsh bashing a protocol because the default client doesn't have a feature you want.

Can you explain this multisig thing to me. From what I understand you need to get multiple people to each sign the transaction before it will go through. But then the people with the keys could agree to split it between them. You would need to trust at least one person. 
Not going to lie but if I was running this and the numbers started to get past $50,000 I would take the money and run.

That sounds like a great idea. Everyone tips a bot $1 to enter and then it all gets tipped to one user. Only problem is you need to trust the bot owner to not run off with the money. I don't think there is anyone that wouldn't be tempted to send 1 million dollars to themself.

Mining is the hardest part to explain I was even confused about it initially. Also one of my friends said "If you can back up your wallet why don't you just keep copying it it get more money" even after trying to explain that you can't they just said that "Someone will find a way"
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:51:19
Using an offline wallet is only really necessary if you are storing a large amount of bitcoins. If you only have about $100 they are probably perfectly fine on a regular password protected wallet assuming your pc has no viruses or key loggers.
