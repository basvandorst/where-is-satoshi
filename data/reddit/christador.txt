If their ability to loan you money was swayed by your Bitcoin investment, something is seriously flawed here. But then again, we are talking about Wells Fargo.

So how would taking Bitcoin have prevented this?  Is there no fraud (yet) with Bitcoin?  
$250 is a pretty small price to pay if you've been in business for a while.  It also will raise your awareness of doing transactions like this in the future.  Most people are honest, but if you train your people to ask for a little bit of information with higher-risk transactions, it usually will throw the customer off and they will move on (for example, tell them they need a phone number and the billing ZIP code of the credit card).  Also, dummy cameras are helpful if you don't have security.  Most thieves do a little bit of homework before targeting a place.

What if there was a charge that truly was made fraudulently (or even BY the merchant)--then I'm stuck with no recourse?

I like snooping around for good deals at pawn shops. I always ask if they still take cash or did they switch over to Bitcoin. I always get a confused look back.

Not reportable because it was deposited in the form of a check.  The reason they do it on cash is because there isn't a money trail.  They are able to track the money to the source with a check.  That's not saying the bank doesn't have an internal policy that may delay it, but they are only required to report cash deposits of 10k+.

That's only malware not virus protection.  They are different.

So what do you do for e-mail?  Also, you can be savvy when you browse, but they are getting more clever about how they get you.  When you do a Google search, 'most' of the time the top search results are safe, but not always.  No antivirus is asking for trouble.  I know exactly what I'm doing online and would never be totally without it.  That's like saying 'I'm a great driver--I don't need a seat belt.'
@_date: 2015-09-06 18:25:57
That's not active protection against viruses; just malware.

Super lightweight, doesn't harass you, and is cheaper than most other paid options.  Eset is awesome!

Actually, a virus ridden site sometimes IS the top result--just not for very long.  It will even disguise the URL to look like a legitimate site.  The risk is not really there?  Do you know how many infected PCs I see on a daily basis from people that HAVE antivirus software??!  Oh sure, let's get infected and just wipe the hard drive and reload, because we all know how fun of a chore that is.  Let's see...where is my Office product key?  Shit, my kids have homework that I have to back up...  I think I have pictures of those little shits at the hospital being born on there too.  Oh wait, I can't really even back anything up because of the virus.  Well, no problem, I'll be fine losing everything.  Just have to start over.  Crap, so I lost all my favorites too?  And my contacts, e-mail, saved passwords to websites, etc.?
How can you argue you don't need antivirus software and in the same breath say antivirus companies take too long to find a fix, and that users don't update it?  You are talking out both sides of your mouth with that entire second paragraph.
Most people do more than visit mainstream sites.  Their kids download cheat codes for games, they click on shit they shouldn't on Facebook and Youtube, and sometimes they even install the shit because it looks like a legitimate Microsoft update.  You may know the difference but the other 95% of the planet fucking doesn't and they get infected all the time.  A friend of mine works for Worst Buy and they check in over 20 computers EVERY DAY.  Of those, 19 of them have some sort of infection on them.
Conclusion, I have been in IT for over 20 years.  If the average user doesn't have some sort of virus protection they are ignorant and/or a complete idiot.

[Talking out of both sides of your mouth again](
Eset is the one I recommended lol.  I think we're done here.

To clarify, since has her panties in a bunch over this:
Malwarebytes has over a dozen products on their page.  One of them may offer real time 'virus' protection. But Malwarebytes as a whole started as a 'run on demand' program that 'generally' only detects malware and isn't meant to be a substitution for a real-time antivirus solution.  That's why you're able to run it parallel with real antivirus software, as two antivirus programs can't coexist on the same PC or they conflict with each other (this is a generalization--there may be one or two that by some stroke of luck may be able to be installed side by side, but generally they can't and is not recommended if they could).
As far as the difference, categorically they are similar in the sense they are both malware.  A virus more specifically spreads (hence the name virus) and malware (malicious ware) is more of a nuisance than an actual virus.  
I didn't want you to think you could just install the on-demand version of Malwarebytes and be protected.  I recommend Eset.  It is very lightweight and affordable, and they have been around for nearly 30 years.

No, the difference is that upon detection by antivirus software it stops the virus from spreading further.  It turns 'I lost everything' into 'I had to pay a little bit to have my system cleaned.'

Debit card fees vary from provider to provider.  Element Payment Systems, one of the largest in the U.S., charges a flat rate regardless of the type of card.  You would be silly to use a debit as a credit if you knew you were going to be charged the fee.  Most debit card users use credit simply as a convenience so they don't have to enter their PIN, but if they knew they were going to be charged a surcharge, they would certainly run it through as a debit to avoid the fee.
@_date: 2015-03-01 07:08:41
To a degree.  But American Express by nature has much higher fees than Visa/MC/Discover.  So if you negotiate your statement fee to be waived (which I looked up and it is $7.95) you will likely still be paying a substantially higher 'discount' rate.
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:43:40
AMEX has a higher merchant fee (4% + I believe) and a mandatory $5 per month statement fee (even if no charges go through) but I am an AMEX cardholder myself and have never paid extra to a merchant for them to accept my card.  I'm pretty sure that would be in violation of their terms.

Never have had an issue buying bigger ticket items with a credit card.  They factor in many things when deciding if a purchase will go through or not--length of time as a cardmember, purchase history, payment history (are you a pay in full customer, etc.), and more often than not if you have the available credit your purchase will go through.  If not it's time to switch banks.  I carry two cards--American Express and a Capital One Visa.  I have NEVER been declined with either one and those cards do some heavy lifting from time to time :)
@_date: 2015-02-28 17:21:48
I'm not sure about the UK, but here in the states that is a violation of Visa/MC terms.  You can't charge a fee to accept cards.
Edit:  They changed it.  Merchants can impose a surcharge on credit cards (only--not debit cards) and they still cannot in the following states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah.
@_date: 2015-02-28 18:48:12
Ah, did not realized they changed it.  It is interesting that they cannot impose the surcharge on a debit card though.  Many merchants are charged a flat rate no matter what type of card is used.
Also, as I read a little farther down:
Surcharging isn’t allowed everywhere. Currently, there are laws limiting surcharging in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah.
