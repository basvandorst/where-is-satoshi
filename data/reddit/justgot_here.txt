What do you mine? And how? 
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:56:02
Yen?

Yeah I see the conflict between the self-governing nature of the bitcoin ecosystem and a traditional auditing/rating agency. But even if the "rules" and standards are formed and agreed upon tacitly by the community rather than imposed, having a single source that keeps tabs on how companies are complying with these standards would allow the market to more easily favor those that do.

Thanks for the answer. So the problem people are seeing with bitcoin right now is that mining "pools" are dominating the game and therefore centralizing the mining process, correct? If some update or other version were to actually effectively make ASICS unusable would that solve this  problem? Or would people be just as able to create dominating mining pools without them?

Here's what I'm wondering: how much of the cost/delay of international wires could be brought down now that the banks finally have some competition to "fix what wait broke?" This goes for money transfers like Western Union as well. 
Will they be able to just improve their networks and efficiency to the point were they can provide same-day transfers for below 1%-3%, thereby taking the wind out of bitcoin's sails? (I realize bitcoin fees are even lower than this but if we're talking about a difference of ~1% it will be much harder for bitcoin to supplant the entrenched systems).

So what does this mean? How soon is soon?
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:47:20
go on...

Is this one of the problems addressed with litecoin? (sincere question, I still don't quite understand the difference between the two.)
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:13:48
Ah, my bad. I thought since this was a self-described ponzi game it didn't really count as a scam.
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:30:47
Well that's a bummer but thanks for keeping us updated.
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:05:31
Thanks, I was about to post there as well.

How is the source of the leak from Mt Gox? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:26:15
Yeah the more I've thought of it the more I think it would work best to at first have a website that is dedicated to providing user reviews and general information about services--and then if it was popular and became reputable it could possibly transition into offering its own audits (after assembling the proper teams of course).

This could potentially be the most convenient and cheapest option, OP. Apply for a card with no annual fee and no foreign transaction fee, add your sister as an authorized user, send her card, pay the bill in USD. You could even do this with a debit card with Charles Schwab (no international fees).

Thanks for the suggestion. It looks like the cheapest viable option (non-cash or Moneygram) for me to buy from localbitcoins in AUD is 7% over the BTC/USD price, so I'll end up loosing more than the $40 USD bank fee. I should point out that I'm currently in the US, so I can only use online payment options.
