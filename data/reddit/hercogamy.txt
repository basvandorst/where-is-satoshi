That's some the best advice i've read here for choosing the safest bitcoin wallet. 
How convenient is fragmented backups and multisig in your experience? I'm assuming you use this for long-term storage.

Yep, this will be a really popular bitcoin wallet system! It would be like a kind of "self-2FA" - safe yet empowering users

Excellent thanks, I've updated my comment. 


Also... wouldn't this increase the risk by using a "hot" desktop wallet?

Yep good point! Thanks. I've updated that.

These days everyone has their own personal favorite bitcoin wallets. I've listed the ones that I use below. You can get a good [overview of the main bitcoin wallets]( and understand the safety of each type. 
- **Hot (online) wallets** - for small amounts used during everyday transactions: **Blockchain.info, GreenAddress, Coinbase Vault storage** are all trustworthy online wallet solutions. Never keep more than you can afford to loose in an online wallet.
- **Hot (mobile) wallets** - for fast &amp; easy payments at shops, on websites, or between friends with their own smartphone QR code. AirBitz, Mycelium, GreenBits, Breadwallet are currently the most popular mobile wallets. 
- **Hot (desktop) wallets** - for broadcasting cold storage transactions (**Armory**), or simple usage: **Electrum** (the all-round best option in 2017), **Copay**, or **Exodus** are excellent desktop wallets with an active development team.
- **Warm (hardware) wallet** - for keeping operational funds secure. Or for making big, yet easy, transactions: the **Ledger Nano** and **Trezor** are considered to be the best hardware wallets. 
- **Cold (paper) wallet** - for long term offline extra safe keeping: **Bitaddress.org** is a good paper wallet generator. Note that using a paper wallet as a beginner is not recommended. As the reply below suggests, beginners wanting to create a paper wallet are better off simply writing down a desktop wallet recovery phrase.
Here's the difference between "hot" vs "cold" wallets:
**Hot wallet:** is connected to the internet. Private keys can potentially be exposed and compromised.
**Cold wallet**: 100% offline, never interacts with any internet-connected device. Private keys are used for signing transactions offline. True cold storage implementations are the safest types of bitcoin wallets.
Bitcoin experts like Andreas M. Antonopoulos use the term "**warm wallet**" to describe hardware storage. Such devices keep your private keys offline, but must connect via USB to make transactions. A warm wallet offers a good compromise between safety and convenience.
