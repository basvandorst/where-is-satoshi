Awesome! Maybe they could add a QR-code next to it as well.

Thank you, I sent an email to BitWall.

Nice try BFL.

It's about the illuminati, you have to illuminate the image.

You're right did the same. It's 6.4 euro per shirt. It's hard to find that kind of deal in Belgium.

Not the same chart:

Applepay, it's called Applepay. No bitcoin. NFC Radio antenna + TouchID.

Sent exactly 0.00618643 BTC. Clicking Confirm does nothing.
edit: Damn I tried to send 100$ to my phone wallet and I accidentally sent it to the address I used for Sun. Any way to recover this?
proof: 
edit2: Received the $100 back. Thank you BitWall.
edit3: For devs: with Ghostory plugin I can't Confirm.
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:32:12
Thanks I do use Ghostery so this was most likely the issue.

We want more monay.

I check this sub reddit very often. I've never modded /new though, but still if you need somebody I can always help.

Does anybody have a link to this guys video?
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:22:04
Starts in 5 hours.

How much would the shipping costs be to Belgium?
EDIT: shipping will be too much to Belgium :(.. Love the designs!

Regarding your final statement about using the users address to check if they received the funds, why doesn't mtgox use this approach? Are they so oblivious to this? It seems like they're making a big issue out of this to hide something else maybe?
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:56:10
There is no Bitcoin funding option. Anybody else able to find it?
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:42:36
Thank you. Received the $100.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:58:23
Thanks, how long did it take you to receive the Starbucks card?
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:32:40
Your move Hewlett-Packard (HP), Acer, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Gateway, Sony, Asus, Lenovo, IBM, MSI, Samsung, etc...

Maybe GHash does this on purpose to bring up the 51% issue sooner than later. I like this, it's better to fix it now than if Bitcoin potentially becomes much bigger.

Am I the only one getting "Access denied" when I open their website. It's been like this since yesterday. Maybe it's because I'm from EU? It seems that the website works for most people since nobody is complaining.

Can somebody provide a list of the locations? Or at least some kind of map where we can see where ZipZap is used? I haven't found any.
@_date: 2013-06-02 05:19:00
I actually emailed them about a week ago. This is their response:
We have no immediate plans to introduce new payment methods in the near future, but we will look into introducing more localized payment services in the long-term future.
