It's good if the tipping address is separate. Keep in mind that tips are divided between many of the restaurant staff, and not just your server. Having a traceable blockchain address will actually add a layer of security so that servers can't conceal part of their tips. Hell, you could even use multisig addresses to ensure that the funds are distributed fairly.

My brother, around 2000 was building a new office space in their shop. The electrician asked them if they'd like him to run CAT5 cable while they were at it. My brother's words: I cannot possibly conceive of ever needing to network our computers.
It's our family's "640k ought to be enough for anybody," and we haven't let him live it down either.

Seems like the dialogue surrounding Bitcoin in news media is slowly getting less sensational and more technically accurate. Well done to the author of that story, whom I am too lazy to go back and look up.

Nope. She *still* stands by her claim that Dorian invented Bitcoin.
