Agreed! The coinkapp crypto price list is brilliant. I've made some high-return investment decisions thanks the position/rank tracker, which helped me spot rising or falling coins much faster. Pro=tip: get a quick idea of how the market "feels" about any given coin based on the social links wording. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:56:39


Yes, exactly. 
I like this site also. Easy to read yet provides a vast amount of information in real time. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:13:03


It's a social stats site! IMO stats can get very anti social when you look at them for too long... the idea of having "social stats" bring the former back to life and make it more fun. You should defo browse through their bitcoin sub-page from time to time. I've read some very good cryptocurrency trading analysis there.

- **[coinkapp]( - remarkable list of bitcoin / crypto **market capitalizations, important stats, &amp; trending social topics**. Somewhat similar to coinmarketcap, with extra useful features - eg interactive 7/30/365-day **price charts** or 24h-volume evolution (nifty tool to spot double top/bottoms). I've made some outstanding trades thanks to the 'rank-tracker' bar chart - notably by spotting rising/declining coins much earlier than i would on coinmarketcap. 
- **[CoinDance]( bitcoin community stats - definitely the most **interesting statistics** on bitcoin that you will find (lots of cool random figures). I often use Coindance to get a quick overview of the price (over different time periods), the current **GoogleTrends search volume** for bitcoin, the community interests around bitcoin (eg i recently learned bitcoin is increasingly being using in the online dating community). Also - scroll down to the "bitcoin engagement by gender" - here you can see that we absolutely need to do more work as a community to include women in all areas of bitcoin. 
- **[Obituary stats]( - you may think I'm joking - but these stats really help me understand &amp; focus on the **importance of having a long-term strategy for holding bitcoin**. No matter how "emotional" you feel about bitcoin in the current moment, realize that it's mostly media reporting or FUD on social media that are influencing your feelings. Go read the obituaries back to 2010 - understand that they've all been wrong. You'll find the same **"bitcoin is dead comments"** by searching reddit from 2010 to 2018. Always remember that Bitcoin the technology (&amp; bitcoin the currency) has **always been very much alive**, growing, &amp; boasting an active empowered community. 
- **[Bitcoinity exchange rank]( - as a newcomer to bitcoin, it's best to know which exchanges are attracting the highest trading volumes. Such exchanges usually have the most users, among which professional/serious members from the community can be found. I would recommend choosing the **most appropriate high-volume exchange** for your use-case &amp; scenario (eg are you looking to do pro trading on bitfinex/gdax or are you looking to make large yet simple &amp; once-off orders on bitstamp/kraken/gemini)   
- **[Tradingview]( social bitcoin stats - pro traders use this platform to **share in-depth technical analysis and debate** each-others' prognostics. What I like most about the site is the buy/sell speedometer - whereby users can show their current opinion for bitcoin. If you are all about the price of bitcoin, then tradingview has great user-generated stats, info, and discussion.  
- **[Blockchain.info]( technical graphs - these are indispensable to every bitcoiner. Important charts include **block details, mining information, and network activity** - eg the mempool size (ie the amount of unconfirmed transactions) or average transaction fee. I especially like to follow the **"hash rate" chart** - as price has proven to be closely correlated. Blockchain was once the holy grail off online wallets, until they sacrificed their most popular features to be more "regulator-friendly". Nevertheless I absolutely love their graphs which are clean and easy to read/understand. 
- **[Coindesk]( news trends - the most **objective reporting** about bitcoin progress, price, &amp; happenings in my opinion. I stay informed on major/important bitcoin breakthroughs (eg Segwit, lightning, mimblewimble, atomic swaps...) on Coindesk - they tend to explain these new concepts really well. Remember what I said about the obituary stats - well generally coindesk will be the **first to report about events**, and mainstream media will then paraphrase events, usually adding a more negative angle to the story. Hopefully this also helps you understand how media reporting has impacts on market emotions, and therefore the price.
- **Satoshi.info** -  has some very **technical bitcoin node statistics** in real-time. Dashboards include bandwidth usage, fee estimates, mem pool, p2p message stats, peer information, system metrics etc. I like using this stats website for all BTC network related research. However for basic network figures, I do feel that the Blockchain site is more appearling from a UI perspective. 
- **[Lightning Network]( stats** (on testnet) - you are right to be curious about lightning. Just this testnet lightning node map really shows how successful this is going to be as these people/nodes move over to main net (the real bitcoin network), fees get cheaper, and micro-payments finally become a super efficient reality on bitcoin. 
- Wach how **[Segwit]( adoption** is progressing steadily and surely. Also an important bitcoin statistic to pay close attention to. Looks to me that segwit will continue rising in popularity and adoption - a good thing for the cohesion and scalability of bitcoin's future :)

interesting, yeah bitcoin mining energy consumption has always been one of those topics that people know exists.. but many just reckognize it as essential. After all, how much electricity through expansive air-con offices, inefficient microsoft servers, business jet fuel do VISA, Mastercard use on a monthly basis?
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:11:16
Good job posting about moonmath.win - the bitcoin price log chart is an excellent statistic that people often forget about, but that shows bitcoin long term viability (as a medium to hold value). I like the comment on their site about the impending BTC "word domination" - very true 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:51:25
My pleasure, and please go ahead and ask any questions, I'm happy to help!
Not sure for live lightning network/nodes stats. Does anyone have any recommendations for this?
Be sure to check out bitcoinity charts and info too! I like the UI (for staring at night) it's easy on the eyes. 
Another comment recommends cryptomaps.org - which i regularly use too! Great place to get a quick, yet very visual overview of the cryptocurrency trading market as a whole.

I feel that Twitter and the people behind the company have always had a longterm interest and support for Bitcoin. If I'm not mistaken:
- Wasn't the US gvt auction of silk road coins partially purchased by someone a linked to twitter?
- Serious investors linked to Twitter help fund Blockstream development a couple of years ago
-  Now the co-found of twitter publicly reminds everyone the intrinsitc value of permission less payments and how Bitcoin allows this. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:01:12
that was also my take on things. It mostly happens when the price drops... perhaps because servers can't handle so many people wanting to place orders at the same time?
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:57:08
Well I see many alternatives on the guide (CEX, Gemini, Kraken...). I guess that's why it's also possible to remove Coinbase and recommend other sites. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:52:53


Agreed. For example, in Europe it was one of the first places to have an excellent process for exchanging and purchasing bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:58:18
Yes I think Kraken would scare some beginners away. The site and fees are great, but not that easy to understand at first
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:54:10
Interesting observation. By this, would you be implying that the down-time may be a deliberate attempt to manipulate the market price.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:54:56
Maybe, but why though? They make transaction fees on both sales and purchases - regardless of which way the market moves.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:45:14
I'd be curious to read more about this Bitfinex bot... any sources?
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:56:21
Good point. Would it be possible that it's not the bitcoin crowd flocking to Coinbase that's making the site crash? I would be amazed if Ethereum purchasing (and the transaction slow down) has had this effect on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:31:33
To a certain extent it's good, yes. Though I've recommended Coinbase to so many friends, colleagues, and family members... I hope that they can resolve this persistent down-time. Coinbase has always been my go-to place for learning and buying bitcoins as a beginner.
