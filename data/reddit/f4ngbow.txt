Trump is perhaps the most crypto-adjacent President we could ask for. He doesn't give a shit about your coins, and he definitely doesn't like the Fed. His agenda is safety, stable economics and the importance of thorough cyber-security. 
There is no fucking way in hell that Hillary wouldn't have started stinking up Bitcoin by now if she was POTUS. 
Check out Nick Szabo's Twitter sometime, btw

If that is true, then why does Nick Szabo, Nassim Taleb and Peter Thiel support him?

Then you haven't done enough research. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:50:21
You obviously haven't done your DD. Sad!

Or maybe you're just worn out from being fed a lie for so long.

You are naive.

Anyone who is "deep" in Bitcoin knows that Craig Steven Wright invented it. Look up John Matonis and Ian Grigg for starters.

The only rule? Don't trust, verify didn't exist until newbs needed a concept they could wrap their heads around. Crypto is about leveraging trust, and never having to trust someone more than you feel comfortable. Verification is automatic. It doesn't matter.

So why is it that 150+ devs, some who have been working on BTC since the beginning, have switched over to BCH? Why does Brian Armstrong and Bitpay and pretty much every actual service prefer BCH over BTC?

For selling fucking fireworks? I've got some bad news for you if that's the case. Right now in America there are thousands of convicted criminals doing the same thing Roger Ver did.

No, they don't need Bitcoin. They need ideal money.
I don't care about convincing you. I'm hoping more reasonable people read this exchange and do their own research, since you clearly couldn't bother. 
For those wondering what the causation is between fees and ideal/sound money: high barriers of entries such as fees and second layers and segwit and opening a channel just to buy coffee are inherently limiting as an economic factor. This should be obvious. The predominant factor behind ideal money is that crappy/inaccessible money always wins, *unless* there is an appropriate global money standard by which all other currencies can be reasonably leveraged against. It is not global money if the intrinsics have been altered in a way that limits usage. 
How long have you been aware of and held BTC? Just curious. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:21:55
That's a total fucking lie and you know it. Anyone who is reading this, you are being lied to by Do your own research! 
@_date: 2018-07-04 20:56:33
Why did Gavin leave BTC? And the other devs? Why did they go? Were they all scammers too?
Where's the lie?
I've been in this game since 2010. I don't need help.

I am defending an obviously innocent and good-intentioned man from a fucking smear campaign. Show me some real evidence that he has astroturfed in the past. Meanwhile, I can pull up ten videos right now of Roger going to businesses and meeting random people on the street trying to get them to switch to accepting Bitcoin as payment. He has literally been doing that, nonstop, since 2011.
Have you actually watched any interviews with the man? Or seen any of his talks or presentations? One of my favorites is an older one with Erik Voorhees where he is speaking at a conference and stands up and says "I literally can't sit down right now because I'm so excited to tell you all about Bitcoin."
He has been here since the beginning, and I don't blame him for forking off when you have people like Samson Mow saying that Bitcoin isnt for poor people and when you have tons of major companies drop BTC as payment because of fees and processing times. The community voted unanimously in favor of bigger blocks, the early adopters and devs agreed it must be done to maintain the intrinsic properties of Bitcoin, and they act mad when the community all left to do what they originally set out to do instead of some weird socialist science project of dubious origin and intent. I don't blame Roger at all. You shouldn't either!
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:08:11
But he is right? Fees make an inaccessible asset, which encourages unsound money. That is simple economics. Your moral posturing is not based in any rational metric, however. Go read some Nash and actually learn the intrinsics. Samson Mow saying that Bitcoin isnt for poor people is much more egregious on an actually morally contemptible level.

People don't need caviar to survive.
Look up John Nash (the film A Beautiful Mind is about him) and his theory of "Ideal Money", it is an economic theory based on intrinsic properties of money and how "bad money" propagates. Understanding Nash is just one but an important part of understanding Bitcoin, and why Bitcoin Cash had to happen.

How long have you been in Bitcoin? Roger is A) an upstanding, self-made man with real skin in the game that has done a LOT for Bitcoin (BTC and BCH) adoption. And B) Roger has very little input compared to the many (150+ last time I checked) devs working on BCH. At best he can take them out for fancy dinners in Tokyo and suggest things, but he knows just as any that he is along for the ride. Jihan's monopoly is rather unfortunate in a pragmatic sense, but if you look at who has more skin in the game then you can generally know who to trust, because they have more to lose as a result of their actions.
I'd like to hear more than "Roger Ver BCASH" if you have any real concerns. Full disclosure, I hold BTC/BCH almost equally. Less BCH because I can spend it on stuff, these days.
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:32:33
Yeah, so you are clueless or wilfully ignorant. Have fun with that!
To everyone else: a lot of the early adopters and devs switched over long ago and you have been tricked. Bitcoin is something else now, and the community of BTC is mostly derived of late adopters like who spend all day defending their Socialist AXA token.

What makes you think it's a scam?
