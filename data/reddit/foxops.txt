Without knowing more about your business, I couldn't say.  But here is how I'd look at it if I were in your position:
**Transaction friction**
Does accepting bitcoin reduce transaction friction for customers (or potential customers)?  Do you have a bunch of potential customers that want to pay you, but can't, in whatever currency (or currencies) you accept?  Does the reduction in friction justify the cost of implementing a bitcoin capability? (This is kind of unlikely I think)
This depends on you and your customer base.  Do the ideas behind bitcoin appeal to your customer base, would that translate into better sales?  Would it somehow hurt sales, or otherwise be a waste of time?  I think a survey is in order.
From my personal experience: when a musician makes the music digitally available and asks for payment only if I like it, that musician is more likely to get my money.  If bitcoin is accepted, the odds of getting my money are even higher (because it appeals to my political views, ugh I feel dirty for saying that).

There is a way, it is just expensive.  Automated pre-approval and binning of orders based on risk level (considering several variables: ip geolocation in relation to customer reported address, proxy detection, etc).  I've got experience with one such system, [Accertify]( at a service provider with millions of subs and a small loss prevention department (3 to 5) you can get the fraud rate down to the single digits.  It is very expensive software.
You'll also have to set yourself up for PCI compliance and all the mess that comes with that.
