Sending transactions to themselves doesn't make them any money, it burns their own money.
I don't see a strong incentive for them to do what you described.

Anyone have links to technical arguments for this?

I think that's a fallacious argument. The principle has always been that those able to do more work for the network get more reward.
Another way of looking at it is that miners voting for smaller blocks are actually voting for holding the network back. Perhaps it is fair that there should be a cost for this, just as there is a cost for producing and handling larger blocks.

BIP141 still includes the phrase "Exact details TDB."
If SegWit will actually adhere to BIP9, then that phrase is not needed and should be removed asap.
Core developers should also be informed, because some are still under the impression that SegWit will start to "enforce rules" at 75%.
Core should either fill in the missing details, or just indicate that SegWit will comply with the 95% threshold indicated by BIP9.

Agreed. What's the "Exact details TBD" still in BIP141?

By that logic, an upgrade of main chain capacity to 2MB is long overdue and would benefit the miners much more in the short term.

I never even heard of Uphold.
But I sure have heard Antonopolous refer to the "Internet of Money".

Hmm, their current rewards are based largely on finding new Bitcoin blocks, with an increasing part of fees (at least that's how Bitcoin is supposed to work - fees increase as the block rewards diminish).
LN will reduce the amount of transactions on the Bitcoin network by moving the majority of transaction off the chain, and thus reduce the amount of fees for Bitcoin miners as well.
I wonder if the miners have thought this through...

Alex Petrov, CIO of BitFury agrees with you:


The previous halving also did not dramatically affect the price, suggesting that some of the increase may already be priced in by miners.

Rusty, thanks for the description.
Can you comment on why some BIPs, like CSV, adhere to BIP9 (as described by you above), but others, like the planned SegWit soft-fork, introduce additional thresholds (75%) which are not specified by BIP9?
@_date: 2016-03-31 15:13:05
Yes, that does greatly clarify the meaning.
When do you expect that these TBD's can be resolved?

Honestly seems a bit daft, this whole "blockchain blockchain blockchain" dance around to avoid mentioning Bitcoin.
Is this what bankers do?
