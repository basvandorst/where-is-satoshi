A 172 billion marketcap and a volatility index that went up since january 2018 is not enough to convince you that the volatility of btc has nothing to do with the amount of buyers. I rest my case.
@_date: 2019-07-25 10:21:41
'Look at gold'. Yeah, what's with gold? 'Look at the price chart since 1974 and tell me that's a non volatile coin, lol: 
'It's not like it's going to triple overnight once mass adoption settles.'. As if losing 92 percent in 2018 wasn't enough volatility for you. 
'No price volatility when it's used by everyone' &gt; complete utter nonsense. A claim backed by nothing. The Australian dollar has a lower MC and stable. Same goes for Tether. Why? Volatile supply. You can lower MC of Tether and Australian as much as you want, they'll still be pretty much stable. 
'People will spend more of their btc as they feel richer as the price slowly increases'  volatility will make it useless as a currency. The reason many coins are stable is because central banks manipulate demand and supply. The marketcap of the Australian dollar is lower than btc. Same goes for Tether. 'More people owning it will take volatility away' is just a bs argument. 
Plus: in your model the price increases infinitely. There's no volatility but the price increases infinitely. People will pay for goods and services because there is no volatility or very low volatility according to you. At the same time they will spend more because the price increases. But there is no volatility. Yeah, that sounds very realistic...
It's clear you live in a fantasyworld. I think you should go back to school and learn some economic principles.

The general population isn't important anymore cause we don't need their money, as institutional money is coming in. And yes, these are whales pumping the price, which is always the case. But they do it when they think there's enough positive feeling and trend.

200k could ONE DAY be possible, but it could be reached in 10,20 years, or maybe never, nobody knows. Btc is certainly not used the way gold is used. There is way more speculation on gold. Even holders want to sell btc one day to cash out. This means that btc has less intrinsic value than gold when it comes to store of value.
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:29:46

Are btc and gold comparable? I would say yes and no. Yes, because the supply of gold doesn't increase so much like btc. And yes, because like gold, btc has something mythical about it (gold because of the history, btc because of the unknown figure of Satoshi - who created this coin that partially disrupted the financial system?). No, because gold is for the elite and btc is for the mass. Btc is the people's asset and for the whole world, gold is the elite's asset for only a few countries. No, because btc is backed by a mathematical formula which enables a trustless payment system. Gold isnt't backed by a mathematical formula. From this standpoint, btc has more intrinsic value than gold (although it's mainly the blockchain behind it, which can be duplicated). From another standpoint, gold has more intrinsic value, because it's used in industries and for jewelry. Are they both a store of value? Probably, but it's difficult to compare something that has been a store of value for centuries and something that has been here only 10 years. Gold already proved itself to be a store of value, btc has still everything to prove (and it's able to lose 50 percent of its value in a couple of weeks, that's not a very reliable store of value yet). There's still the possibility of btc not being able to survive. We can't exclude that. The debate about the real value of btc isn't concluded. Nobody in the world will doubt the value of gold, but there's still a huge portion of the world population that has doubts about the true intrinsic value of btc. In this phase, it's difficult to say: this is what bitcoin means for the world, this is its practical use, this is what you dan do with it, etc. We just don't know yet.

@_date: 2019-07-11 18:08:41
Maybe, but only for like 10-20 percent of them. And purely for speculative reasons when btc drops further and then goes sideways, cause most of the altcoins have no usecase (the goal of most of these altcoins was making payments, and that failed).

Why wait and see while we already can see in the cryptoworld? Tether has no fixed supply, so it is around 1 dollar since its launch. All other stablecoins are the same, all other crypto that don't have this, including btc, are volatile. How much prove do you want to have? What's so difficult to understand?
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:58:37
In fact, gold is a competitor of btc. Btc needs a marketshare of gold to grow. You have x amount of money and this money can be 1) spend to buy goods, services or buildings 2) kept on a bankaccount 3) spend on stocks ) spend on gold or silver 4) spend on crypto 
It's likely btc will get marketshare from gold.

It's a bearmarket until ath is topped. Just like 2014-2016 was a bearmarket with a rally in february/march/april 2014, when btc went from 200 to 600.

So, according to buttcoin, exchanges and tether move the price up and down to liquidate people and take their money? Is this true or not? And who's controlling these exchanges and suspicious  transactions? Basically the exchanges (the true whales) decide what happens?

There's 216 billion Bitcoin marketcap not sitting on a bank right now, and this amount is growing. Banks are forced to look at crypto now, cause money is floating away from them. The next bullrun will be massive, cause banks will be offering cryptoportfolio's. They have no other choice. There's alot of people that might want to invest in crypto, but they aren't tech savy and are afraid to lose their key. Banks might step into that hole if they're smart, and this could trigger a massive bullrun. If banks don't adapt now, we're heading to a new crisis bigger than the previous one. Money is shifting away from banks, what are they going to do about it? Are they still in denial? It seems like some are waking up now, but it might be too late.
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:58:51
Idiot, I was talking about the oil crisis of 1973, which caused stagflation (high inflation + high unemployment), due to Arabic countries boycotting western countries and no oil export to these countries. Same stagflation that is happening now in Venezuela due to sanctions. Keep believing US msm propaganda, you donkey.  US and only US is responsible for destroying Venezula's economy, the same way as they're destroying Iran's economy through sanctions. Venezuela isn't allowed to export anything due to sanctions. Companies are forced to shrink down their capacity and fire people, while demand for products stays the same. This causes high inflation + high unemployment. It's called stagflation.
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:26:23
No Kenesyan propaganda, pure logic. Replacing fiat by btc will lead to immediate collapse of economy. I explained it on this board many times:
1) price volatility will lead to high insecurity among consumers and businesses
2) price of borrowing money will be huge due to rising price of btc (you borrow 10k now, you have to pay back 20k in a year)
3) people will spend less money because they'd rather speculate on rising price of btc
4) rising price of btc will lead to much less exporting, cause products will become too expensive for other countries to buy
Conclusion: total collapse of economy
You can dream about your ideal financial fantasyworld all you want, you will never be able to escape inflation in real life if you want to live a normale life.
Like most people on this board, you're brainwashed and don't know what the hell you're talking about. You don't have a clue about basic economic principles. I'm glad you're not in charge, cause I won't have a job because of foolish keyboard-che guevara's like you.

Monero, binancecoin, ethereum, xrp and a few others will survive. They already have somekind of usability. You don't have to use monero for example to buy goods, the coin has some usecase because of the anonimity (alot of people like you just don't want to be tracked). But every other coin that has to be used for payments and transfers in order to be functional has basically zero value. Nobody is going to use coins to buy stuff when these coins have no stable value. Bitcoin is an exception, the volatility is no problem anymore now that everyone has excepted it will never be a payment method and only a store of value. There were discussions after the 2018 crash about the true intrinsic value of btc. People were woried about the low adoption rate and the fact only 1.5 percent used btc for payments. As a payment method, btc has almost no intrinsic value. As a trustless decentralized store of value system, its intrinsic value is pretty much secured.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:12:43
This is caused by people shifting from altcoins to btc. All altcoins are in red. I guess it's the winner takes it all now. Expect more and more altcoins being liquidated.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:25:29
As an investor, you should base your investing strategy on worst case scenario's and not react like an emotional little child. 'Everything that's not positive for btc and doesn't suit my interests is false' is not the right attitude. Btc is not your mother or sister and you can't make love to a digital code. You should approach it clinically, without any emotion. The emotional garbage on cryptoboards make people look like fools. You're an investor, not a politician. You invest in succesfull assets, and if they're not succesfull you get the fck out and invest in something else. That's how it works. This emotional garbage has to stop.
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:12:41
No, the previous one went down 83 percent over the year and I don't expect btc to go down 83 percent this year again. I expect a drop to appr. 6k. And yes, this is now a bearmarket. Lower highs, lower lows, lower volume, descending triangles, fud, and mediahype + fomo gone.

Bottomline is: btc is not a threat to the dollar, so basically, they don't really care about btc. Everyone knows (except Cryptogrip) btc cannot replace the dollar due to price volatility. Libra is different. A stablecoin that could reach 2.5 billion people. It could potentially disrupt the financial system.

Sell your altcoins before it's too late. They're going to get crushed. There will and cannot be a usecase for payment (use) with these altcoins when they deal with fixed supply and price volatility.

@_date: 2019-07-25 00:30:20
They're not afraid of btc, at least not yet, it's not a danger to the dollar. They're afraid of Libra. And they might not be able to kill btc directly, but there are many ways to marginalize Bitcoin. An additional btc-tax, heavy regulation for exchanges, banning exchanges, banning btc ownership, etc. They won't do that, but they can bring down the price.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:42:42
It will never be used as a payment method, despite some stubborn people here that claim it will once more people buy it (volatility is here to stay forever, don't listen to them). Btc = a combination of store value and gambling coin.  Not a payment method, never will be. Your mother will never use it.

It's backed by the stable dollar, which is stable due to priceregulation, but if there's extreme demand for Tether, Thether needs to sell additional Tether in order to keep the price at one dollar. That's why when you look at Tether graph, it's never 1:1 dollar, but there are fluctuations. It even went to 0.86 dollar once because Tether couldn't keep up. Priceregulation is what keeps a coin stable, nothing to do with marketcap.

Mnuchin wants to destroy Libra and probably Tether too. There will be alot of lawsuits cause Zuckerberg wants to grab that big piece of stabkecoinmarket. It will take years before we finally know if Libra will be launched. Meanwhile the US government could come up with draconic regulation against crypto to protect the dollar. If they don't block Libra, many businesses will introduce their stablecoin (Google won't allow Facebook to take the whole stablecoin market). If these companies introduce their stablecoin, the dollar will be in big trouble. Zuckerberg is hiding behind unregulated cryptomarket, that's why his Libra will be on the blockchain. But now he might have triggered massive regulation to protect the dollar. I'm pro Libra. Libra succes and other new stablecoins from big tech companies will trigger the biggest bullrun ever seen.

Crazy post. Why the hell would governments replace their national currency with a highly volatile coin that isn't even used in western countries as a payment method, precisely for the same reasons, volatility. It will crash their economy within hours, and they won't have any control over it. The only thing that happens is 1) government officials buying bitcoin because their bank accounts are frozen 2) a government introduces its own cryptocurrency/stablecoin with volatile supply, like in Venezuela. This is already happening and this already happened. A government replacing its national currency with btc is suicide.

Regulations can block new money coming in as well as attract new money. It depends what kind of regulations. Blocking Libra in the US and Europe clearly doesn't benefit btc, cause Libra brings enormous publicity for crypto. The same thing happened after Facebook and Google blocked Ico and crypto advertisements. Interest from general public dropped significantly. Every day billions of people saw crypto ads and were being accustomed to crypto. Other regulation like forced identity control by exchanges drift criminals, who have alot of money in btc, away from crypto short term, but might atract more small institutional money long term. Excluding exchanges (which is happening in the US and happened in China), makes it more difficult for citizens to buy crypto. So, I thought I'll give a more nuanced answer than for example Cryptogrip, who obviously has lost track of reality and frames everything as positive for btc - doesn't work like that.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:02:37

Trump created a precedent. US financial institutions and government will see it as a pass to come up with strict and tough legislation. This will influence Europe etc. We're already in a bearrun due to tougher and tougher regulation. Then you have Libracoin, this is seen as more dangerous by governments. That's why they will come up with very strict regulation. They will never accept Libra, therefore they must come with strict regulation, that will affect btc and other crypyos too. They can't produce laws only for Libra, it will be for all crypyo. I hope you understand now.

@_date: 2019-07-16 18:36:05
More and more altcoins will die, yes. Btc will probably survive because it can be used as store of value, especially in times of high inflation. As for other coins like wanchain, power ledger, etc. &gt; They will die cause they need to be spend in order to be usefull. But people don't spend currency that is volatile. So it's over for most altcoins. Btc is entering a new bearmarket now, yes, but you never know how high it could climb.

My personal opinion is that the true intrinsic value of btc is the fact that Satoshi never made himself known publicly. This makes btc not lead by a company or person,making it the most decentralized coin in the world. In practice, it's manipulated by whales, so it's not as decentralized as Satoshi imagined. His goal of btc as a payment method will never be met as well. A coin with fixed supply isn't able to serve as a payment method for current economies (except in countries with very high inflation like Venezuela, only temporary). Another value of btc is that it's the cornerstone of the cryptosystem. Everything is paired with it, it's like the dollar of the cryptosystem. It has no real intrinsic value in the classical sense of the word. At the moment, the largest part of its value is based on belief. It has yet to really proof its value in the western world. That might come in the next decennium, when inflation problems will occur. I'm pretty sure that its value will rise much higher. Also, don't forget that btc was the first digital coin. It was like a big bang, and btc is like the sun, with all other alts and other initiatives like Libra floating as planets around it. Surely, there are huge problems to be solved, mainly the fact that most cryptos have failed as a payment method, despite  having good ideas. We will see more projects like Libra, with stablecoins, the only coins that could serve as coins to pay goods and services. The problem is, they are not completely decentralized.  Maybe one day, someone will invent a decentralized formula for stablecoins. That being said, cryptos are highly unpredictable, sometimes a mistery. We can only speculate about it.

Shitcoins do have a fundemental flaw that cannot be solved in the future, no matter how much technological progress. That flaw is simple and logical, two things that your mind cannot grasp. They are volatile due to fixed supply. Therefore, they cannot and will never be used. This has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with technological progress. It's a fundamental flaw within the design of the code. That's why they're ALL failing, without any exception. Keep buying shitcoins, you will learn the hard way.

There is no such thing as 'once enough people own it, it will function as a currency'. It has nothing to do with the amount of people owning it, but everything with fixed supply that causes volatility, and because of this, people will never use it as a payment method on global scale. How many people own the Australian dollar? Now tell me why the Australian dollar is so stable. Because more people own it than people own btc? Wrong.

All these hearings of congress are one big ego fest. That guy asked: during the Lehmann brothers period I still had confidence in my bank. No shit, they were backed by government money. Banks had to be bought up by governments and it was announced on the news. Despite all of that, many banks did fall and people lost money. People decided to let their money on banks that were saved by the government, but what would happen if there was a bank run on those banks too? So, if congress is so concerned about bank runs, they should back people who lose money on btc or libra because of a run as well. In other words: it's not because banks are banks that your money was safe, but because governments backed it with tax payer's money.

Why do you think people don't put much money on banksavingaccounts in western Europe anymore? Because the interest rates are so low, you actually lose money due to inflation being higher than the interest rates. So yes, inflation makes people actually spend more money instead of saving more money. It's not that they spend ALL their money of course. But a couple of percentages less or more spending can lead to less of more economic growth. Consumers spending and consumer's trust is the basic vehicle behind economic growth. So, 1-2 percent inflation a year is ideal. Central banks are trying to keep it at 1-2 percent.

Volatility is mainly caused by: 1) fixed supply 2) nobody knows what the true value of btc is, so people tend to sell when it drops, because they're scared 3) btc probably attracts more speculators than any other asset. But the most important is fixed supply, so no, it will never lose its volatility. 
One of the counterbalances of volatility are whales. There are big whales/holders, miners and owners like the Twinklevoss twins holding for years and years. It's actually the general public/average investor who often cause these massive priceswings. One small whale dumps and they all follow.
By the way, people who say 'volatility will diminish with more owners' &gt; this is not true. This is more hope/delusion than reality. People who own btc tend to believe in this lie because they see mass adoption as the endgoal. So they tend to believe every crap and lie that has been fed to them, just because they want the price to go up, even if this crap goes against every logic and against the facts.
@_date: 2019-07-08 23:55:13

Apart from volatility, what do you think will happen with the price when companies need money to borrow and the supply stays the same?

High inflation leads to too much purchasing power being lost. It can lead to protests and revolutions, like we have seen in Venezuela and and Germany. Deflation leads to people spending less money and putting more money on bank accounts or in assets, because their money increases in value and thus it becomes more attractive to save money. Too much saving is very bad for economy, cause less goods and services will be bought. The consequence is companies will have less revenues, they will have to sack people and they will have less money to invest. The unemployment will rise. Around 2 percent inflation is pretty much ideal. That is what central banks try to archieve, and until now they did a pretty good job in doing so by printing additional money and keep the interest rates low in order to keep the cost of borrowing money low for businesses and consumers (which laeds to more spending and less saving). The problem of this system is, while unemployment has been kept low and the national product of countries has increased, the purchasing power over times hasn't really increased that much. The salaries went up, but just a little above inflation rates and for some groups the purchasing power diminished or stayed the same. So, while there was big economic growth over the past decades, the majority of this money went to the rich and the middleclass hasn't become much richer. That's one of the reasons the middle class isn't happy. The system has worked to keep unemployment low, but like every system it's not ideal and it comes with a price. Now, replacing fiat with a volatile supply by btc with a fixed supply is not the solution neither, cause this will lead to mass unemployment and the collapse of western economies (demand for btc will rise and rise, making the cost of borrowing money/btc for businesses too high and consumers will choose to hold more btc, speculating on a higher price, instead of spending it, and there is of course the volatility). So, in the end, there must be some inflation. There is no other choice. Even 1 percent less spending can make a difference between economic growth and stagnation or recession. The current system might collapse when consumer trust drops significantly, so much that the policies of low interest rates and printing money don't work anymore. Then there's a big problem. This can happen in times of war and very low trust in governments, corruption etc., and when people lose faith in own currency. You can see this in countries like Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Turkey, Iran etc. That's when cryptocurrencies might become interesting for average joe, but even in those circumstances, you see more people buying the more stable dollar or gold, because btc is just too volatile to trust and to make purchases with it. Though as a store of value, it might be a good choice in those circumstances.

No business wants btc. All businesses that accept btc have a link with a middleman company, which takes the risk of pricedrop. 
I have a business and my clients can pay with btc. There has never been a client that pays with btc, but if they do, the money is collected by the middleman company and I bear no risk. I get what the client payed at the moment of transaction, even if btc drops in price. 
I have to pay the people that work for me and other costs. The price volatility of btc would ruin my business. Btc is absolutely not suited for daily transactions due to volatility, and will never be.

People complain about Libra being centralized. How could it not be centralized when we're talking about a stable coin? You need a central party to buy and sell enough coins to keep the price stable. So tell me, how could you have a coin that is used to pay for goods and services without a central authority that keeps the price stable and thus reduces volatility. People want a decentralized coin which is at the same time stable enough to buy goods and services. No, you can't have that. You can't walk on the sun, you can't eat icecream in a black hole.

Yes, we both know this, so why stating the obvious. It's not about spending all money or saving all money. But a couple of percentages more saving or more spending can be the difference between a recession and a booming economy. I mean, do you want to invent the wheel? Everyone knows that higher interest leads to more savings in general and lower interest leads to less saving and more people and companies borrowing money, and that deflation leads to less spending and inflation to more spending. Maybe you won't do it, but in general, for a whole country, that's how it works.

I do have a problem with your flawed claim that 'the more people own it, the less volatility'. I guess a 350 billion marketcap at ath wasn't enough to bring down volatility. It crashed 80 percent in two weeks. You can't come up with a single example in history to back your statement, neither can you back your claim with the pricehistory of btc itself. I'm not attacking you as a person, I don't care who you are.

@_date: 2019-07-25 02:17:27
I explained it on this board many times, but people just don't understand because they're stubborn and clueless. This will happen when you have a deflationary coin with fixed supply like btc:
1) price volatility will lead to high insecurity among consumers and businesses
2) price of borrowing money will be huge due to rising price of btc (you borrow 10k now, you have to pay back 20k in a year)
3) people will spend less money because they'd rather speculate on rising price of btc. Spending = needed to keep unemployment low.
4) rising price of btc will lead to much less export, cause products will become too expensive for other countries to buy.
Conclusion: total collapse of economy

It depends on the outcome regarding Libra. They're waiting on the sideline. If Libra is banned from the US and Europe, they won't do it.

"the market". You mean a couple of whales. 92 percent of btc is owned by 4 percent. As if the majority of btc owners follows the news.
And by the way, this is why I said the comments from Munchen and Trump two weeks ago were negatieve for btc in the short term, cause it will lead to other governments wanting to regulate the shit out of crypto or completely ban it. Not a single government benefits from crypto. It creates taxproblems, it endangers the national currency (Libra) and it's harder to track criminals. That's why governments are against it or at least don't see anything positive in it, unless it's their own crypto like Venezuela and Iran.

Are you serious or just talking out of your ***? Gold has underlying physical value. It is used in industries, for jewelry etc. So it will always have that underlying value. Bitcoin does not have an underlying value. Yes, the decentralization, but that's blockchain, it can be copied. The only underlying value it has is the fact that it's not driven by a company or person, which makes it until now the most decentralized coin. The fact it has no underlying physical value like gold, makes it of course way more volatile than gold, yet another reason for the extreme volatility.

Basically, at least for now, they're not going to kill btc. Merely because it's not a replacement for the dollar. There's a lot of criminal money in btc that is untracked now, so they will tighten the regulation when it comes to identification, merely through exchanges. It will have a downside for btc short term, cause criminals will take part of their money out, and just because of Fud as well. In the long term, moderate regulation can pave the way for more institutional money.

I prefer to base my opinion on facts. Ath is 19 months ago. We've squeezed btc to 13.8k and now were in a bearmarket again, potentially going back to 5.5k. 20k is far away atm. Yes, we will probably reach 20k one day again, but 19 months without reaching 20k makes 20k de facto not an easy target.

5) btc makes it easier for countries to avoid sanctions from the US

O come on, please... banks use that capital for what? The majority is parked in stocks and bonds and stays there, it's not even pumped back into the economy. Spending of the mass is extremely important for the economy. It has nothing to do with Keynesian politics but with reality. 
"And money printing plus low interest rates is one of the very reasons bitcoin exists as an alternative to."
So what? It doesn't mean it can solve problems out of its reach. 
"The idea we have inflation to thank for our jobs just doesn’t make any sense - of course we might lose our jobs in a hyper inflationary environment, or in a deflationary spiral, but productivity is what drives consumption and employment."
Productivity + monetary policy. Both. I agree the monetary policy is stretched way too far. It's at maximum reach now. But the alternative is being less strict with it and lose a couple of percentages of growth, which as we have seen, makes people like you and others angry, because of more unemployment. People within the cryptocommunity think they can invent the wheel again. Things are done because there's a good reason to do it. Btc offers no alternative solution.

Did I talk about btc? Alot of coins are really bleeding out. Some of them came with apps etc. and nobody uses them. The problem with most alts is they needed a volatile supply to become succesfull (that means price stability), but volatile supply means no real decentralization and no money from investors (investors need the price to go up). That's why you're left with good ideas now but no usercase.

Price stability has nothing to do with more owners but with fixed supply. Look at Tether: less marketcap than btc but stable. Due to volatile supply. Same goes for Australian dollar with less marketcap than btc. Inflation around 2 percent is needed to keep unemployment low. People here don't understand economic principles.

It has other value as well, but not as important as the decentralized store of value one: 1) it is the central coin within the cryptosystem, everything is paired to btc 2) it is based on a mathematical formula, you cant't destroy the mathematical formula. Theoretically, you could destroy every dollar on the planet. If you burn every dollar and liquidate the digital dollars, there's no dollar anymore. But you can't destroy the btc code, it will still exist. And I guess some others here could find other small intrinsic values. But the most important one is being the most decentralized store of value (this is partially based on consensus, because in 2018 people were debating about what the value of btc was and in 2017 alot of people thought btc could become a payment method)

That's not what the past showed. Volatility of btc since beginning of 2018 has gone up, while more and more owners came in. 
"The bigger the marketcap the more demand needed to move the price up". A marketcap of 350 billion at ath december 2017 is not enough for you? What's the marketcap of the very stable Australian dollar? 350 billion? I don't think so. There's only one reason for the stability of the Australian dollar, and it has nothing to do with amount of owners but everything with supply volatility.

No. You're comparing stablecoins with a store of value coin. Fiat doesn't become meaningless when goldprice rises to 1 million neither, cause people still need to buy food and they won't be able to buy it with btc due to price volatility, or with gold. Btc reaching 1 million will probably mean the collapse of the economy. Too much money will sit there in btc doing nothing instead of being pumped into the economy. You won't be able to find a job due to high unemployment. Governments won't allow so much money in btc instead of real economy. They'll probably try to make you pull your money out of btc and spend it, for example with additional cryptotax or something like that. Spending money = good for economy. Money needs to be spend to keep unemployment low. That's why interest rates are low and inflation is around 2 percent a year. "But but inflation bad, government bad, central banks bad". If you want to keep your job, you better pray for 1-2 percent inflation a year. Otherwise, don't fcking complain when you lose your job.
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:47:11
The fixed supply leads to high level of speculation. Suppose someone buys 5000 btc at the price of 10k. More and more buyers come in. The price goes up to 20k. The whale sells his btc, triggering a pricedrop. The theory of the people who believe that volatility will diminish is: this whale won't be able to trigger a pricedrop when he sells his btc at let's say the price of 500k. This is false theory. The pricedrop will be the same. The price will fall with 5000 x 500k, triggering a sell off. The only way to diminish volatility is when central banks/governments regulate the demand and supply, like they do with their national currency. In that case, btc won't be completely decentralized. The price will be centrally manipulated the same way as the dollar.  If enough people globally own btc, governments might be forced to do this. Suppose 80 percent of citizens of the US own btc. Let's say the price drops 40 percent. This will cause a financial and economic disaster. The US government might step in in order to protect people's capital and decide to regulate the price of btc, working together with other governments. These things might happen in the future. But before it comes to the point of 80 percent of people owning btc, they might just decide to ban it. One of the problems with btc and crypto in general is that it's highly addictive. Most people need to be protected against themselves. There are too many retail suckers losing too much money on it. These people need to be protected against their own stupid actions. People can talk about 'holding' etc. Fact is you need a certain mindset to be able to hold. One of the traits is patience. Not many people have enough patience.

As an investor, you should base your investing strategy on worst case scenario's and not react like an emotional little child. 'Everything that's not positive for btc and doesn't suit my interests is false' is not the right attitude. Btc is not your mother or sister and you can't make love to a digital code. You should approach it clinically, without any emotion. The emotional garbage on cryptoboards make people look like fools, including you. You're an investor, not a politician. You invest in succesfull assets, and if they're not succesfull you get the fck out and invest in something else. That's how it works. This emotional garbage has to stop. We have seen where it can lead to with altcoin holders. They're ALL bagholders now and they're going to lose ALL their money. People on Telegram are crying from depression because they have banned everyone with a critical opinion and all Telegram groups became echochambers. Now they wish they were more critical. 'O how I wish...'. It's too late. You're going to lose all your money on your shitcoin and it's well deserved cause you should never ever be an emotional cheerleader when it comes to investing.

Yes you're right. I do believe that some new buyers came from around june though, when msm began to talk about btc again, which is backed by google data. But it wasn't alot of new buyers, certainly not comparable to the rise in 2017. This might suggest that we deal with (temporary) saturation. Also, according to data, large amounts of money were put into btc this surge, suggesting it was small investors with relatively large sums (on average between 20k and 40k) that drove the price up. At first we thought it was institutional money, but this was debunked by the CEO of binance lately. So it must be smart money/traders that initially pushed the price up. Now it seems they're taking their gains out.

It's one of the reasons why they live in a rich country with low unemployment. Imagine if there's no moneyprinting. Unemployment would go through the roof. This fact cannot enter the tiny brains of btc holders on this board. They just have something in their head and think there's 'one big conspiracy' from central banks, while central banks try to keep the inflation AND deflation low, so that the people on this board can sit on their lazy asses doing nothing, while 90 percent of people work their asses off because of low unemployment due to 2 percent yearly inflation, a fantastic number. Of course, within a couple of minutes, you'll see someone react on this post with: 'but but btc price only goes up!' So fcking what? Good for you, good for btc. The reason it goes up is because there's a large amount of holders. Now, imagine what will happen if people hold their euro or dollar the same way as btc? Economy will collapse. You need to SPEND money, therefore you need inflation. God bless the fact that central banks and the economy aren't run by these fools. 'But but inflation bad, central banks bad. Orange man bad'.

Agree. I always thought: who's going to use all these coins when they deal with so much price volatility? The answers I got were: wait for the App release/volatility will be less with more users etc. All unfounded shit arguments. There are thousands of crypto apps now on the market, almost all failed. The companies that might succeed with these kind of apps are established companies like LG, Facebook etc. LG is building wallets in their phones, Facebook has huge amount of users and could reach many with Libra. So they are jumping into the crypto market and more companies will follow. Cause there IS money to earn here for companies. Btc had the same problems as alts: who's going to use it for payments? Turns out almost nobody uses it for payments, which was to be expected, seeing the volatility. But there seems to be a new consensus about the intrinsic value of btc, namely that it's a speculative asset + store of value, the latter is something almost no other coin can offer. So there is SOMEKIND of intrinsic value for btc, although there is still no full consensus about it.

Nobody on this sub understood anything about economic principles, because they are heavily invested in btc, and when you're invested in something, you tend to lose sight of reality. Of course this will be downvoted, but the reality is:
1) inflation is needed to keep unemployment low. It's the reason you have a job, be very very thankfull. 
2) Bitcoin has not and will not replace fiat. Another stablecoin can do it, but something with fixed supply cannot serve as a payment method (most important rule)
3) More owners of btc will not lead to lower volatility or make btc stable. Total nonsense. 
4) Centralized versus decentralized: neither of the two is better. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Crypto is just suited for this area and will gain popularity, because it fits this area. Is it better than a centralized system at the moment? Of course not. It's not even really decentralized, it's heavily manipulated and there's massive wealth concentration. But it suits this area.
5) the vast majority of people still prefair fiat. Maybe in the future if will be different.
If you don't understand these points, you haven't understood anything about financial stuff. 
Will crypto become more popular? I think so. 
Will banks dissappear? No, the new banks will be the exchanges and they will be the new middlemen and charge you the same fees or higher fees. 
Will things change? Nothing has ever changed in history. It's always a piramid system with the most powerful and corrupt people at the top. Same with crypto. 92 percent owns 6 percent of crypto. Nothing has changed, nothing will ever change.

You think that central banks do this shit for fun, moneyprinting and stuff? Just to fck people up? Low unemployment comes with a price. That price is the fact your money slightly becomes less worth. The alternative = fixed supply, no moneyprinting. And then you'll see how fcked up things REALLY become. The economy will collapse within a couple of hours. Not only because of less spending from consumers, but because of extreme volatility due to speculation, same as with btc. What a great world would that be, huh, the moment you can't even be sure if one slice of bread would be the same value when you enter the supermarkt as when you left your house. Everybody would be extremely anxious, with extreme volatility. The same way as people are shitting themselves with btc at the moment. This is absolutely not healthy for an economy. As a store of value, okay no problem. As a nation's currency? O boy, keep btc away from it.

Uhm no... that's your interpretation, which is of course always very very biased. The truth is the opinions about btc and crypto are very devided. Mnuchin called crypto a matter of national security as well and called for heavy regulation. Trump called it thin air. Some congressmen had positive words, others were more negative. What counts is that Libra, which was supposed to bring in alot of new money, will not get access to the US and more strict regulation will follow. So short term it's a heavy loss for crypto. Long term we don't know, more regulation might be positive or negatieve for crypto. &gt; This is actually the summary of the past week, not what Cryptogrip says. But everyone with a brain knows that Cryptogrip is consistently off track whith his analysis.

Yes but almost nobody pays with btc because of volatility and fixed supply and everyone pays for their goods and services with dollars, including you.

Market sentiment changed. Lot of negativity and FUD now. For a reason. Libra was supposed to bring new people to Bitcoin. Now authorities finally found a stick to hit crypto. Libra will be destroyed before it even began and no new money will enter the cryptomarket. Where will new money come from? From Tether? Again? Tether days are probably counted. Once Tether implodes whole market implodes. 90 percent of shitcoins are already dead anyway. Institutions still haven't entered the market according to Binance while we all thought small institutional money was entering the market. Lot of shit + descending triangle = continuation of bearmarket of 2018 with a small rally of 3 months like the bearmarket of 2014-2016, so history repeats itself.

An official research conducted by an official research center is more of a fact than some emotional opinions from people that never conducted a research on this board and who are heavily, heavily invested in bitcoin, sometimes with money they can't afford to lose. You don't have to be an Einstein to know that people who are emotionally invested in something tend to lose track of reality and have a very biased outlook on things. I hope we agree on that.

Insecurity on normal stockmarkets, possible shift of money to exotic assets like crypto and gold. Bitcoin has yet to prove its utility to the mass. It can only happen when there is high inflation for some amount of time. Then, average joe will start to look for ways to sustain the value of his money and he might choose btc or other crypto in those circumstances. For now, there is no real need among the mass in western countries to invest in btc. Too volatile, not very safe compared to money on the bank, no use as payment method, too complicated.
When it comes to war: there's no time without war. There is war everywhere in the world right now.
By the way: high inflation will happen when policy to keep inflation around 2 percent fails (which happens when consumer trust diminishes significantly and when lowering interest and printing money doesn't work to make people spend more - until now it has worked). Central banks did a fantastic job keeping inflation at 2 percent, which is the reason some people on this board have a job. Replacing fiat by bitcoin as a payment method will lead to extremely high unemployment and eventually the collapse of economies within 24 hours.
It's the reason the US don't really care about Bitcoin. Bitcoin could take a portion of the market share of gold, but it won't replace the dollar and the US government knows this. If it was a danger to the dollar, they would of course destroy it immediately, like they will do with Libra.
Suppose that for example the US would replace the dollar with btc tomorrow, the high volatility would cause huge problems for businesses and consumers. The only way to somewhat diminish this volatility is when the US government would decide to buy something like 90 percent of btc to hold it. Still, there will be too much volatility in the beginning and the very high demand would lead to higher and higher prices of btc. Businesses will not be able to borrow money without very high costs (repaying btc at much higher price of btc in the future), consumers will spend less because of the deflation&gt; economy will collapse within 24 hours.
Mark Zuckerberg knows btc will never be a payment method, but he also knew Libra could fill up the possible demand for a stablecoin that is used as a payment method. I can only immagine Google, Facebook or Amazon to introduce such a coin succesfully, but the US and other governments will never ever accept this. It will destroy their power.

Do people here understand how fcked up economy will be if there is no inflation? Do you understand the fact that inflation is needed? Do you know the consequences if money increases in value? A level of inflation is needed to make people spend their money. If it goes beyond 2 percent a year, it's bad because it would hurt the purchasing power too much. If it's below 2 percent or even below zero, people will spend less money. This will lead to more unemployment, cause businesses will sell less products. The central banks in western countries and the governments did a fantastic job in keeping unemployment low, interest rates low and inflation around two percent. They had no other choice, cause if they kept inflation around zero, you would be complaining about not being able to find a job and how shit your government is, cause you're never satisfied. Now, lets imagine how devastating it would be if btc replaces fiat in alle western countries: first of all, due to fixed supply, people will be speculating on price increase constantly, which is happening now, and this leads to extremely high volatility. Businesses won't be able to run their businesses if there's no price stability.  Furthermore, due to more demand, the price of btc will rise, making goods and services extremely expensive for countries that have no btc and want to import goods. So it will have a davestating effect on export. Thirdly, people will spend way less on goods and services, cause it's better to place your btc in a wallet and leave it there speculating on a price increase, instead of buying goods and services. Companies will sell less goods, the economy will crash so hard your head will spin, unemployment level through the roof. Finally, businesses and consumers won't borrow money to spend and invest. Take a business that wants to expend and hire more people: they borrow 50k and next year they have to repay 100k cause the price of btc would rise due to more demand and speculation. Tell me how could a company do business when there's a constant increase in price and high volatility? So you can all complain about 'muh inflation', but you don't have a clue about how things work. We don't live in a perfect world. Take your head out of your *** and just look at reality. Btc is nice to have if you're a long term holder, but it's not Jesus, God and Ghandi in one.

It's hard to say you are completely wrong, huh? The statement of btc stabilizing is ONLY made here on reddit. That claim is made because people WISH it so hard (mass adoption) that it becomes a reality in their head. In order to keep believing in it, they brush every fact, economic principle or logic aside, like you do. For most people on this board, it's not even a matter of 'wait and see', it's already a reality in their head. That's how deluded they became. Despite the fact that Tether has no fixed supply and is pretty much stable until now. And look at the pricepattern compared to btc and other crypto with fixed supply. It's stable! How could that be? Is it because Tether has much more owners than btc, the claim that is made here on this board (the more owners, the more stability)? No, it has nothing to do with that false logic. So what could it be? Maybe, just maybe, because Tether has no fixed supply? I mean, maybe this sounds TOO logical for you?

A decentralized stablecoin (I don't know if DAO is really decentralized) could work, but you need a network of people to make it functional. Facebook has it.

@_date: 2019-07-08 14:33:39
Newsflash: there will never be mass adoption. Stablecoin Libracoin will get mass adoption as a payment method, btc will be a store of value. Already 19 percent of world population owns btc as store of value or speculatitive asset, so it's already adopted. More and more people and institutions will own btc, but it's already adopted as store of value (19 percent btc versus something like 6 percent gold). Bottomline: its either a currency or store of value, can't be both. Things have settled in favor of btc as store of value, and if that's the case, if price keeps rising, more and more people will jump in.

I think you missed the whole thing. This is what the discussion with Tether is all about: are their Tether backed by real dollars or not? Tether could be very stable, even if it had zero real dollars. You don't buy dollars when you buy Tether, you buy Tether. A couple of months ago, Tether issued a statement saying only 70 percent of Tether was backed by dollars, but nobody knows. But it doesn't matter for this discussion. Could be zero, Tether could still be stable in that case. If there are 50 Tether on the market, and I want to buy 150.000 Tethers, what do you think would happen? Price would go up (volatility). In order to prevent this, Thether regulates supply and demand, so that the value stays around one dollar. It's very simple to understand, even a child could understand, only you don't understand cause it would undermine this false narrative in your head that btc could be stable one day if enough people own it. Totally false. As if a 350 billion marketcap on ath isn't enough. It's all false cryptoscience, based on nothing but imagination and hope. Needs to be debunked so that we can move on.

Yes, that is true. + The fact that the inventor isn't known and therefore it's the most decentralized coin in the world that has gained some trust from a part of global population as a store of value and speculative asset. There is a void for another currency to serve as a global digital payment method. Facebook wanted to fill up that void. If Bitcoin was used as a global payment method, it would be a danger to the dollar. That's why the US wants to destroy Libra and not Bitcoin.

We're not talking about success here. In fact, looking at price, it has been very succesfull. We're talking about volatility. The conclusions of brilliant economist about volatility has not been 'we wait and see'. The conclusion is: the main reason for the dollar to be stable is the monetary policy, and the reason Tether is stable has been the same, volatile supply. The reason btc is not volatile is because of fixed supply. 
You are lying about 'brilliant economists' so that it fits your narritive. You believe so much in btc that you just brush facts aside. They are right under your nose, like Tether and True Usd, but somehow brilliant economists' said 'wait and see'.

It fluctuates, but not so much as btc, and that's due to volatile supply and moneyprinting. Same reasons why Tether is a stablecoin and the value keeps fluctuating around 1 dollar. If Tether had fixed supply it would be very volatile. Same goes for True Usd and other stablecoins.

Yeah scarcity but eventually demand will saturize.   20 to 50 million people already own btc. There's some room left for growth from small institutional money and from people in third world countries (but they bring in small amount of money). Average joe in western countries is not interested as we have seen, neither are institutions. The biggest growth at the moment will probably come from people who already invested in btc and crypto. This rally was mainly caused by people who already had money in Tether and crypto.

That's what I said, gold is not stable.
What you don't understand is that you can't buy food or company machines with a house. Businesses need superstable prices to do business. These prices need to be controlled.
'Until it reached absolute adoption'. That doesn't say anything. Suppose there were 50 btc in total and 10000 people living on the planet. If all these people traded in btc etc., there would be constant price fluctuations. In your theory, going from let's say 50 users to the max (1000) would mean 'absolute adoption' and the price would be stable.  It doesn't make sense whatsoever. Unless a third party steps in and controls demand and supply and absorbs volatility. That's what's happening with fiat, and it's a good thing for you, not a bad thing. You should be very happy instead of complaining. You have the choice to put part of your money in Bitcoin. At the mean time, you can pay for your goods and services with fiat, controled by a central party. Win-win for you.

When 99 percent of the market has no usecase, it's not called cleansing of the market, it means the market failed as a whole. There is not a single coin except maybe btc and 5 or 6 others with a usecase. And I'm not even talking about the price. Btc is the worst performing asset since january 2018. Almost 60 percent down in value, most alts down 90 to 99 percent. It's one big mess at the moment.

I don't understand the delusional talk from some people. The discussion about btc as a payment method is closed. It's an economic law that something with fixed supply has volatility and cannot be used as a payment method. Then you'll hear people say: what about gold, it has fixed supply and still not alot of volatility. Because gold doesn't have fixed supply. It's mined every year, so the supply is volatile.

LN has nothing to do with mass adoption as a payment method (to buy goods). 
Libra might be adopted as a payment method. Because it's a stablecoin and only stablecoins can be used as payment methods. Libra en btc are no competitors. Btc is not a payment coin. Only 1.4 percent use it as a payment method. It has failed as a payment currency (buying goods and services).

Because they need food and a house. Most people have just enough to pay for the bills, food and rent. I won't say this fiat monetary system is ideal, cause it has its problems, mainly the fact that the purchasing power of the middle class stays the same or diminishes. That's why you see so many anger among the middle class in western countries. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and now the middle class gets poorer too. But, replacing fiat with a cryptocoin like btc is absolutely not the solution. It will cause tremendous problems due to high volatility and people speculating on it and holding it instead of spending it. Eventually, it will lead to mass unemployment. Btc is only good as a nation's currency in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe, who deal with extreme inflation. It's also good to invest in btc to protect yourself in case there will be extremely high inflation in western countries in the future. But it's just not a permanent substitute for fiat.

Libra is actually a good thing for btc and economy in general. While Bitcoin might be a good store of value, too much saving and holding is not good for economy. Money needs to be spend, consumers have to buy stuff, and we need a digital stablecoin that is used on a global scale to pay for goods and services. Btc is already a store of value,  has high volatility, it's not suitable to pay for goods and services. That's not a problem, btc can perfectly exist next to a stablecoin that is used for payments. In fact, Libra will attract many new btc buyers all over the world. It's free publicity for btc. And if Libra doesn't succeed, one day another stablecoin will succeed.

There is no hard guarantee, as we have seen Tether is under investigation and people don't trust it. So what you say about the guarantee is not true.

It has little to do with the amount of people. Volatility is mainly caused by the fact the supply is fixed. If the supply were volatile, like the US dollar or Australian dollar (which has a smaller marketcap than btc), or like Tether, the price would be pretty much stable. Now, like the previous poster told, offsetting volatility by another party is an option but I don't think it is possible the way Tether does it, cause Tether basically owns the coin, so they know exactly what's needed to be bought and sold to keep the price stable. So I think some level of volatility will remain and this will be too much to do business and buy goods and services. On another note: do we really want btc to be adopted as a stable currency? No, we don't want that, we want the price to go up. And do we really need mass adoption as a means of payment? No, we need institutional money and institutional money comes in when there are gains to make and gains won't be made on a stable coin. So why do we even care about mass adoption as a currency by average joe? Many average joe's will step in when  there's high inflation (a period of high inflation will come sooner or later). So he might put some of his savings into btc, not to buy goods and services, but in order to not lose too much capital due to high inflation or to diversify his risk. Also, why do we want btc to be adopted as a means of payment, when we know the US won't accept it and will try to destroy it, like they're about to do with Libra. At this moment, western governments don't really care about btc, they consider it a speculative store of value and thus not a threat to their national currency. And what precisely is wrong with that position? It's a good position to have.

Centralized stablecoins could be the first digital payment methods used by average joe (think of Libra), which btc due tot fixed supply could never become. Even then, it's not said that btc will lose against a stable coin, as btc could still be a store of value, existing along stablecoin payment methods. Other threats are strict regulation, people just losing faith in btc, hacks or Satoshi making himself publicly known, which could lead to btc losing its mythical aura. Other threats maybe are btc becoming too old as a technology.

No, you're not overthinking it. It's pure logical reasoning, which doesn't exist in some people's headspace on this board. Btc cannot be both a store of value and a currency. In fact, crypto has failed being a currency. The reason is simple: due to fixed supply, the value is volatile, so people speculate on it. Same goes for alts. The difference is that most alts MUST be a payment method in order to succeed and btc doesn't need to be and can just stay somekind of store of value.

Why are you lying to yourself, defending the statement crypto is an honest system, while everyone knows it's heavily, heavily manipulated. It's either an honest system or a dishonest, manipulated system. If it's a manipulated system, it cannot be an honest system. The statement that crypto is an honest system is simply a false claim. If you keep repeating the same bs over and over again, people start believe this bs. Go watch Telegram and see how many people have believed lies and told lies to themselves.

There is no saturtion point when you deal with a fixed supply. I don't know where this crazy idea comes from. As long as people sell and buy, there is volatility. Difference with fiat is with fiat, volatility and priceshocks are absorbed by central banks. So, no there is no saturation point. It's an imaginary idea the cryptowprld has invented, based on nothing. 
Volatility of btc has increased since january 2018.
You don't understand business nor economics. Businesses need money to grow, especially in the early stages. They need to borrow money. You can't borrow money if price increases drastically + volatility. 
People that invested in btc, especially on this board, understand nothing about economic principles or business. They live in a fantasyworld.
They want the price to go up, but at the same time they want btc to be a general means of payment, which cannot happen both. You talk about this fundemental contradiction and you get the weirdest answers. These are not investors but crazy fanatics that want to bend time and space because they have something stupid in their head that just won't go away.

No, it does not serve as a hedge. That's the biggest bollocks I've ever heard. Same as 'institutional investors stepped in this year', which turned out to be a hoax as well. What happened is people/investors that were already invested in btc  made a negative correlation between global politics and btc price and decided to put more money in it. There are NO new investors, as seen on google trend. We have reached a saturation point where there's no new investors and every money that's put in, is from existing investors.

"I have started businesses without ever borrowing money". Yeah, so fcking what? You and your small business that adds nothing to the economy. If you take away the option for businesses to borrow money, the economy will slow down. Companies borrow billions of money to invest in new buildings, new machines and new people. And what does this create? JOBS, lots of jobs. And then some stupid-smart Redditor, who thinks he can invent the wheel again, comes by and says: "hey man, I've got this great idea. Let's just replace fiat with a fixed supply coin so that companies aren't able to borrow money anymore due to increasing price of btc". 
Do society a favor and never ever apply for a financial job. No wonder you had "many businesses". You have no clue of finance and business and probably bankrupted many businesses due to stupidity and false beliefs. The tragedy is you haven't told yourself 'I have no fcking clue of what I'm doing' and you keep repeating the same dumb mistakes.

When NOTHING useful is made in the cryptomarket, it shines a dark light on btc. I never agreed with people saying alts are bad. Alts are good for btc if they actually are functional. But they made nothing useful. 
I am the average consumer and I'm NOT going to download one of these shitcoin 'killer apps' to store coins on it and make payments with it. Why? Because I don't want to pay with a coin that fluctuates in value. When I want to buy a car, the car must be 20k today, tomorrow and next week. So how are these cryptocompanies going to attract consumers? Nobody thought about this fundemental flaw, while its the most important thing in the first place.

Bitcoin is reaching a saturation point. Almost 11 percent of Americans own bitcoin. The speed of the price increase is drastically slowing down and this has been the longest bearmarket ever in the history of btc (45 percent pricedrop since ath). If you were early into btc, you're lucky. If you invest now, you have to wait a long long time before you  can get big gains. 20k is extremely hard to reach. You basically need extreme hype like in 2017 to reach it again. It's a very difficult time for crypto. All alts failed, so the whole market just crashed/imploded.

I think small because I can see the bigger picture. I do believe in decentralization as an additional option for people, and because decentralization of the financial system is how the course of time will evolve, but I have never seen a system where power isn't concentrated into the hands of a few, and crypto is no different. So I gladly shoot bulletholes in the delusional talk of btc fans. I don't like to hear delusional crap from people . We have seen this over and over again in the past: new political movements, cult leaders, etc: 'everything will change', 'this is the truth', 'this system is the best', blabla. We have seen it with communism, nationalism, et cetera. I don't believe in systems because there are no good systems. History repeats itself, and btc has the same old flaws as any other system: highly concentrated wealth, gini coefficient of 0.84, highly centralized through exchanges and whales and miners. Now, will it be a success? Yes, it will be a success and the price will rise, cause it fits perfectly with this period of time. But to think that btc will change the power structure etc., is highly delusional. The same piramid system as before is installed, the only difference is there's probably a couple of new people at the top of the piramid.

If any country had btc, economy would implode within 24 hours. Fixed supply leads to:
- high volatility (no stability for companies and consumers, no trade possible)
- businesses not being able to borrow money due to increasing prices (you borrow now, you pay back twice the amount next year, impossible to do business)
- price increase would lead to implosion of exports due to rising valutavalue
- way less spending. People speculation on price increase instead of spending. Businesses sell less, hiring less and less people. &gt; Very high unemployment rates. 
It would be a total disaster for every economy

And who are these so called 'professionals'? You don't have to be an Einstein to make reasonable statements based on logic. And I don't care about my self value. I just state my opinion. You can give counter arguments. Saying things like 'the system has to be restructured' doesn't mean anything. 
What do you think will happen if governments and central banks pulled themselves out of the fiat system? No more interest changes, no more moneyprinting? I'll tell you what will happen: huge unemployment. You think central banks are applying their policies just for fun? Just to fck consumers up with 2 percent inflation? It's needed, cause like I said, it's about businesses. Without businesses, there wouldn't be an economy. 
Now, if you don't have a fcking job nor business to run (I'm not talking about you), and you don't have any responsabilities in life, bragging about being a libertarian (whatever the hell that is), you won't give a shit about real life and practical solutions. That's why you have all these parrots on this board, repeating the same nonsense over and over again, without any real clue about how things really work. And to make it worse, they think everything they say is true. Because their teachers/prophets are so called youtube 'influencers' - jobless people reading shitbooks in their basement, spouting their opinion as truth.

No. True price = intrinsic value. It comes from people who believe in a decentralized non-controlled coin that might be a hedge against inflation, the holders. 50 percent of btc buyers are speculators or semi-speculators. The real price is around 4-5k atm.
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:59:07
It will never be a payment method, despite delusional people like cryptogrip saying that it will. It can only be a payment method if there is a price stabilizer, for example a central bank buying  and selling btc. The amount of buyers and better network and progress in technogy have NOTHING to do with less volatility. We have seen the technology progress over the years, with LN, etc. The amount of people buying goods and services with btc is still under 1.5 percent and doesn't change. Furthermore, why would you even want btc to be a stablecoin? Not interesting if the value doesn't increase. It's completely stupid.

They read and read shitbooks. Then they come up with these selfmade concepts: inflation is bad, saving is good blabla. Go tell a hard working business owner that saving is good for economy, stupid clowns. It's all inverse reasoning: btc must succeed, so let's build a whole new economic theory around it to support the crypto concept. Doesn't matter if this theory is full of logical holes, we just fill the holes with more imagination and new fantasy concepts. That's not how you build a theory. First you need to ask: does something really work? Does saving help the economy? Would it be a good thing if people put their money in btc, sitting on their coins for years and years, like a duck sits on her eggs, instead of spending their money to buy goods and services? Then the conclusion must be: it would be a disaster for economy. Your local seller needs your money to pay his bills, to invest and hire new people. Help society and SPEND your money!

When you are an investor, NOTHING should be ignored, positive as well as negative sentiments and opinions. If you want to be a cheerleader, you can dress like a woman and support your local football team. When it comes to investing, there is no such thing as 'supporting an asset'. The market doesn't give a shit about you, and you shouldn't give a shit about the market nor the asset you're investing in. You invest where there's money to make, and if everything goes to shit, like all altcoins, you get the fck out of it.

It has been one sided, but for the U.S. not China. It costs us nothing to create out of thin air the "dollars" we sent them. China expends significant resources (land, labor and capital) to produce the goods they send us. China is better off with their stuff than our paper.

No, it's pretty much over for almost all altcoins. What people don't understand is something needs to have value/usecase after the maniaphase (2017). 99 percent of altcoins have no usecase. Btc has some intrinsic value due to being a speculative store of value. This cannot be said for alts. Most alts need to be used as a means of payment to be functional. Due to pricevolatility, nobody will use them. Therefore, there will be no new investors for most alts.

The broadening fallout of the trade dispute saw investors rushing into perceived safe-haven assets, with the Japanese yen rising to a seven-month peak.
The yuan broke through 7 per dollar, which some market players have regarded as a major support level, falling to as low as 7.1097 per dollar CNH= in offshore trade and 7.0424 to the dollar CNY=CFXSonshore.
“This could well be the biggest moment for the yuan this year. The impact of U.S.-China trade is turning out to be very big,” said Masashi Hashimoto, senior currency analyst at MUFG Bank.
“Looking at the mid-point, the People’s Bank of China is trying to stem the yuan’s fall,” he said. “The PBOC doesn’t look like it is trying to use a weaker yuan to counter U.S. trade pressure. The yuan’s fall seems to be stemming from panicky selling.”
The yuan last stood down 1.4% at 7.0793 offshore, and 1.1% at 7.0166 onshore. It was the first time the yuan traded above 7 per dollar since May 2008.
The sharp fall came after Beijing vowed on Friday to fight back against U.S. President Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to slap 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports, a move that ended a month-long trade truce.
The plunging yuan knocked off many currencies in the region.
The Australian dollar slipped 0.5% to $0.6770 AUD=D4, hitting a seven-month low of $0.6748. The currency wasn't far off its Jan. 3 flash-crash low of $0.6715.
The Korean won fell 1%, hitting a three-year low of 1,218.3 per dollar KRW=KFCT while the new Taiwan dollar fell more than 0.5% to a two-month low of 31.61 to dollar TWD=TP. The U.S. dollar was on the back foot against traditional safe-haven currencies.
The dollar fell to as low as 105.80 yen JPY=EBS, its weakest since its January flash-crash, and last stood at 106.07 yen, down 0.5%.
The euro also rose 0.15% to $1.1122 EUR=EBS, extending its recovery from a two-year low of $1.1027 touched on Thursday.
On Friday, the closely-watched U.S. employment data showed non-farm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs in July, fewer than the prior month, and wages increased modestly.
The data cemented expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in September after it delivered its first rate reduction in more than a decade last month.

Picture looking very very grim for btc and crypto in particular. Basically, the market imploded. There is no market, cause nobody is using these 'killer apps'. Not a single consumer. All alts are basically dead. Btc has saturation problems, which is proven by Google trends (no new investors since january 2018). 50 percent decline since january 2018 makes it the worse performing asset of these past two years. Crypto is in deep deep problems.

China devaluating currency = American propaganda. China didn't devaluate its currency. They stopped buying dollars. Secondly, pricedrop of yuang and pound doesn't necessarely mean that chinese and british people/investors are going to buy btc. If average joe and investors want to preserve value, the first asset they look at is gold, which is still a more reliable store of value than btc due to less volatility. Suppose a chinese person invests in btc now and btc drops 35 percent in 3 weeks, like it did in july. That person is going to freak out. What you see now, the price increase, is current investors putting in more money. So, when is average joe going to invest in btc? When inflation is higher than let's say 5 percent, in a prolounged period of time. Then btc becomes interesting.

Gold cannot serve as a currency in modern day societies, where companies need huge amounts of money to borrow from banks to invest and keep the economy rolling. It would make it almost impossible to borrow money, they will have to pay way more than the initial amount they borrowed due to huge deflation. That's why we have fiat with volatile supply now, to keep prices stable with around 2 percent inflation. A far more suitable system for modern society.
For the same reasons, btc cannot serve as a currency/payment system. It would lead to a catastrophic situation. So at most, btc is a store of value.
People on this board can't understand these facts cause they view everything from a consumer's standpoint. It's not about consumers, it's about business. Yes, short term it's great to have a deflationary currency. But it's absolutely catastrophic for the economy as a whole and will lead to huge unemployment.
And I'm not even counting in the fact that even the slightest volatility makes doing business impossible. If I want to buy machines for my company, price must be stable, otherwise I can't do business. It's as simple as it is. Mass adoption of btc won't ever happen and shouldn't even be discussed.

Bitcoin is somekind of store of value (not yet because of 4 percent inflation a year, but it can be in the future when almost everything is mined), monero is for people who value privacy, ethereum is a building block for other projects, binancecoin gives discharges on the biggest exchange. I wouldn't buy alts though, because their price still doesn't reflect their true intrinsic price. Take something like Monero: its true price is the core holders that truly believe in storing their coin in something more private. The rest are speculators, so the real price is much lower. It's all about the core intrinsic value. Same thing for bitcoin: its true value comes from holders who truly believe in it being a hedge against inflation and government control. The real price of btc is something around 4-5k, everything above are speculators that want to make quick gains. The real pricevalue of btc might go up when more people hold who believe in btc being a hedge against government control, but at this moment its true intrinsic pricevalue must be around 4-5k. 
All other alts are useless because no consumer is going to use alts to pay stuff when they have so much price volatility due to fixed supply. So all these 'killer apps' are useless. The investors cannot be the users, but at the moment, when the price of an alt goes up, it's because investors put in more money, not because the app is used by consumers, which should be the case when you talk about a healthy viable product. That kind of product is unsustainable long term and will implode.

Ethereum serves a cause within the cryptosystem. It's a building block. Then you have monero that protects privacy, so it can be used by criminals. But there are no coins that are actually spent/used to buy stuff, because of price volatility, which is the goal of 99 percent of altcoins. If their goals aren't met, then its a failure, apart from speculation on them.
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:03:04
How do I know? I guess the speculation will continue but price will rise slower than before. Maybe in a full blown economic crisis with high inflation, it might peak for a whil. I don't see it being adopted by the mass as a currency, only a stablecoin can do that. 20k is difficult to reach, I guess we might reach it before halving of next may.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:10:30

Yes, but there are two other things that complete this: 1) the fact that there is no business behind btc or someone leading it, makes it way stronger than just a blockchain or other crypto with a business behind it. That makes it a truly decentralized system. 2) btc was the first and is being trusted by millions of people. In practice, some other guy could make a blochchain and call it Bitcoin 2/3/4/5 but it will never have the same trust and believe as btc.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:10:19
Specific problems, yes. Unfortunately their price is so volatile that nobody will ever use them. Only alts that really could target specific problems should be stable in price, otherwise they will fail. Problem is, who would want to invest in a stable coin? That's why Libra is probably the only coin that could succeed. It's stable and can be used for payments all over the world. But why would you ever want to use wanchain, Tron, power ledger, etc. It makes no sense besides speculation. Zuckerberg is smart. He sees the complete practical failure of 99.999999999 percent of altcoins. The only wat that people will actually spend their Libra is by making it a stable coin.

Turmoil in international politics (China/Iran), temporary bad prospects on stockmarket, low price after months of bearmarket (3.5k) lead to this rally. But it was overall money that was already in Tether, meaning it were current or previous cryptotraders/miners that put money in, combined with a couple of new small institutional investors. It's all good and well, but we're still at 50 percent from ath and now 19 percent of worldpopulation owns crypto, compared to 5 percent in november 2017. We're close to our limits at the moment, unless huge money from big institutions comes in or Libracoin attracts alot of new people. The big parabolic gains belong to the past, unless big institutional money comes in, which may come one day, but we're far from ath and very far from 50k.

Every country has debths, people have debths. As long as you have a working population, produce goodd and services etc. there is no problem in having debths, as we have seen in over 100 years. The bigger danger is inflation. You think that an economy could run on btc? Try running a country on a highly volatile coin as btc, it would be bankrupt within one day. Printing money = needed to keep the deflation quite low. Imagine having a fixed supply of dollars like btc. It would be a total disaster for the economy. That being said, having btc as well is a good thing to balance things out and in Times where inflation is too high.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:33:44
No, mass adoption will not and cannot stabilize the price, due tot fixed supply. 5 percent of world population has btc. That's more inhabitants than England (pound). Price volatility has nothing to do with the amount of owners of btc. Volatility of btc is still the same as 10 years ago with way more holders and buyers and institutional money. Nothing changed, it will never change.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:12:39
Because it has fixed supply which makes it impossible to use as a payment method. Why do you think you can pay your coffee with dollars? Because central banks print money so that the value stays pretty much stable. The adoption level of Bitcoin peaked in 2017 and then dropped because people don't pay anything with it. Now, that doesn't mean the value couldnt rise. It's a store of value and speculation asset. There was a guy here that had to pay a product with btc. The value of btc dropped from 13.5k to 11.5k. He couldnt buy his product anymore. Mass adoption of btc as a payment method would destroy every economy in the world in a matter of days.

Probably a drop because it lost momentum. Then with good news rise may happen and if it's very good news we might top ath. But could be drop and then further drop and then sideways. The previous bullrun was caused by smart traders and miners that sold in 2018 and then went back in in november/december 2018. Combine that with some wallstreet traders/hedge funds that placed money, and then came Libra anouncement, it caused current holders to put more money in it. One thing we know almost for a fact is that there was not alot of new money from average joe this time compared to november/december 2017. Average joe might step in again when there's high inflation, but it's not sure. The next bearrun might happen due to more regulations/government involvement. But this will path the way for bigger institutions to step in, which might cause the biggest bullrun ever. This is pure speculation, but it might go like this

This is absolutely not organic decline. A big whale is selling. It annoys me that a couple of whales dictate the course of action. Regulate cryptospace asap please, and get rid of the constant manipulation. I want these scammers and criminals out of btc. They're ruining it for everyone.

It's not a payment method. That ship has passed. The intrinsic value of btc is the mathematic formula of a decentralized global trustless system, which is not controlled by government nor enterprises. Even if demand for btc drops to zero and price drops to zero, it will still have intrinsic value, due to the mathematic formula of the blockchain. The same can not be said about the dollar or even gold. If demand for dollar drops to zero, it will have no remaining intrinsic value. Furthermore, Satoshi's formula can not be destroyed. You can burn all the dollars and destroy them, but you can't destroy mathematics. This makes btc the most pure form of money with the greatest intrinsic value. In practice, it will serve as a store of value but probably never as a payment method.
