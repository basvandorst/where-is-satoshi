Are governments silently stacking bitcoin reserves since they know they can’t destroy it? And they use puppets like warren buffet to keep the price low for as long as possible? The only way to still have most power is to have the most of it, like gold?

It’s not really exposed, doubt many people will even see it... it’s not shouting bitcoin either. Some people sucks with design.

government troll by saying government steals? when we pay taxes we get something out of it, when we pay to krapeles what do we get? his dick? my dream is that rest of bitcoins are redistributed on global auction or to victims for free.

Because I get government that builds roads, builds better transport (and steals money). But in krapeles case it is stealing money only? What do I get from giving money to krapeles exactly?

How much did this cost you?

it's not about being irrational, it's about that governments and whales posses huge chunk of coins and they can dictate the price however they want. so they are droping the price, so they can accumulate more then ever, cause they know this is the moment when based on all technological improvements and mass adoption of blockchain, they will never have a chance for manipulation anymore.

Should I buy bitcoin via coinbase pro and transfer to binance, or ethereum and transfer to binance then trade eth to bitcoin? Which is cheaper?

It’s not really on protocol to implement user experience. It’s on projects. Projects that are being worked on are tackling that.
