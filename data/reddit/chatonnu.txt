There's an interesting piece in the NY Times about how there are little to no legal protections for assets in safe deposit boxes lost through crime or bank errors.  Seems like nothing is completely safe.
You can, apparently get insurance for these assets, but it can be pricey for very valuable things.

“The custody and trade execution services that we provide are essential building blocks for institutional investors’ continued adoption of digital assets,” Michael O’Reilly, Chief Operating Officer for Fidelity Digital Assets, said in a press release. “The designation as a New York Trust Company under the supervision and examination of the DFS builds on the credibility and trust we’re establishing amongst institutions” 
This is good for Bitcoin.  Institutional money tends to be pretty conservative, but there is a LOT of it, so even a tiny sliver of institutional participation could be very positive.  And the institutions don't want to bother with the "not your key, not your Bitcoin" nonsense.

 Can I buy cryptocurrencies at Fidelity?
Retail brokerage customers cannot buy or sell any cryptocurrencies at Fidelity. However, those who have a Coinbase digital currency account can arrange to view those balances on Fidelity.com. Although Bitcoin futures are now available for trading on the CBOE and CME, Fidelity does not currently have any plans to offer Bitcoin futures trading for its retail brokerage customers.

In the United States, a **security** is a tradable [financial asset]( of any kind.[\[2\]]( Securities are broadly categorized into:
* [debt securities]( (e.g., [banknotes]( [bonds]( and [debentures](
* [equity securities]( (e.g., [common stocks](
* [derivatives]( (e.g., [forwards]( [futures]( [options]( and [swaps](
By this definition, Bitcoin is clearly a security.

I don't think Trump will get re-elected and I don't think any of the democratic candidates like or even understand Bitcoin (Mayor Pete might - he's super smart.) And I think a lot of institutional money will stay on the sidelines while the presidential race plays out, but there are still a ton of great reasons to own bitcoin and the  hedge fund guys are figuring that out so....I'll say BTC at 25k at the end of 2021.

Do you know when you bought it? Sometimes people lose the price basis on stocks they purchased a long time ago and the IRS will accept a reasonable attempt to reconstruct the price based on when it was purchased.  Lots of times stock basis gets confused with mergers and forgotten splits or reverse splits or company spinoffs, etc.  Unless you are talking huge sums the IRS won't be bothered to harrass you too much. Probably.  But if they get a whiff that you are lying to them, things go downhill fast.

As far as I know, U.S. broker dealers are forbidden from recommending Bitcoin (plus there isn't any way for them to make money with Bitcoin, so they aren't exactly motivated.)  Compliance departments really beefed up after the 2008 crash.  Just one approved Bitcoin ETF would open a floodgate of money.
@_date: 2019-08-16 03:06:55

The IRS always chases chickenshit money. What parts of the country have the highest audit rates? The very poorest because those are the people most likely to get the "earned income credit" and there's always this great fear that poor people are defrauding the system and getting too much free government money.

A **wealth tax** (also called a **capital tax** or **equity tax**) is a levy on the total value of personal assets, including bank deposits, real estate, assets in insurance and pension plans, ownership of [unincorporated businesses]( [financial securities]( and personal trusts.

Yeah, that's a sell signal.  I haven't gotten questions from friends yet, so I don't think there's been as much media about the recent rise.

Au contraire.  Rockefeller built his empire on bank loans.  He knew every banker in Cleveland in the 1860's.  He used borrowed money to buy every refinery and establish his monopoly in oil.

It would work as a currency if there wasn't a cap on supply.  Now it works, I HOPE, as a store of value, as something desired which is rare.  99% of the planet doesn't understand blockchain and hash functions and crypto keys and this has really hurt BTC.  People are scared of what they don't understand.  Gold, on the other hand, is very easy to understand.

Hedge funds are into crypto, but nobody else is because of compliance issues.
