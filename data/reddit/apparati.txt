Crazy to think that one bitcoin can literally turn my (or anyone's) life around

Sounds simple enough. Thank you for the heads up!

Well, that's why I was asking. I don't have the money to buy in right now and it seems that is the only way in. I apologize if you felt I was stepping on any toes looking for help.

God damn you are smart. I wish I was insightful enough to do this. I'm up to my neck in debt. So far mining hasn't gotten me much of anything (made $.02 in the past 2 weeks :x) and I didn't have the extra cash to buy in when they were cheaper.

How long did it take you to mine a full BTC though?

Thank you for your answers. I especially like answer 6 because a great example of this is people throwing money at the football sign kid, but then the kid donating most of it to charity. I have seen all sorts of different types of generosity when it comes to Bitcoin and some are stranger than others.

Care to elaborate? I'm pretty cointarded. D;

Interesting. Thank you.

Judging by your name, it sounds like this worked wonders for you :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:19:02
You don't know how right you are. :P Thank you for the civil response.

That's awesome man, congrats. I see nothing but good stories so far about people who were smart enough to buy in early.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:21:33
Thank you. Are these the faucets I've been reading about?
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:30:33
Obviously I'm not looking for an alternative to working. It doesn't hurt to have a side project, though.

I'm glad it worked out for you. That kind of insight is more valuable than bitcoin will ever be
