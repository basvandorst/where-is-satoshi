How will you know how to paint Nakamoto if no one knows his/her/their identity(ies)?

I largely agree with your analysis, however it is also true that past performance is not a predictor of future performance, and it seems to me that there are truly unique competitors to bitcoin that were never around before in previous bear markets, which could conceivably overtake BTC entirely. It could just be part of that cycle of mood that you talk about, but this really could be the last time bitcoin has a parabolic run.

I've seen a few posts here and there recently where people have stories about being banned from r/bitcoin for truly innocuous things. This place is like a church of Jehovah's Witnesses excommunicating anyone who doubts the teachings.
Edit: [Case in point]( Thoughtful post about recent Forbes article about Bitcoin (and other crypto) was removed by r/Bitcoin mods with no reason given.

I'm not referring to any of the ones you mentioned. In fact I think they are all likely to fall by the wayside compared to the competitors I'm talking about.
For day-to-day payments, you have all the stablecoins, arguably MUCH more useful for transactions than BTC: Dai, Havven, Basecoin, Radix, Holofuel, etc.
In terms of efficiency/speed, being environmentally friendly, more cost effective, you have Hashgraph, Holochain, Radix, Bitlattice, and probably others. Some of these options are also much better at achieving decentralization of the network, without putting enormous power in the hands of a few mining conglomerates.
There are plenty of competitors out there. I'm not necessarily advocating for any of the above I mentioned, and you could certainly critique them too. But it seems to me that Bitcoin's days are numbered, in a way that was not apparent a few years ago when mostly everything was a Bitcoin clone.

Not a nocoiner, and not salty, quite pleased with how I've done so far actually :)

It's hard to say, but I think you're right. The general sentiment looks more like capitulation. When even the "I'm buying when there's blood in the streets" guys are feeling hopeless, that's when we've entered the despair phase, when no one really knows whether it will *ever* go back up again. That's when you buy I suppose.

It's not just deflationary, it's volatile and unpredictable.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:04:39
TL:DR Bitcoin dropped because that's how bubbles work, and lightning is a misguided attempt to make Bitcoin useful for transactions when it's already inherently useless as a currency because of volatility related to capped supply.

That's a very bad idea. It is a scam. You will most likely be manipulated into buying a spike while the leaders of the group do a massive sell-off and start the dump. Also, probably illegal, which hasn't been a problem for these groups so far, but authorities will be cracking down more and more. Just do the smart thing and research deeply into projects you genuinely believe to be important, put your money into those.

It's a fork
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:09:24
Here are a few that I have looked into: Hashgraph, Bitlattice, Holochain, and Radix DLT.
I'm only really interested in one of these, but for the sake of fairness, I'll let you decide which one you like ;)

I am not making an extraordinary claim. What I'm saying is that regardless of the petty details of how much its energy usage will increase over time (maybe, as you say, it will be less than some people argue), because that is missing the point. The point is that regardless of who is right about the future increases in energy use, it is ALREADY too much, and is certain to increase TO SOME DEGREE. Both of these facts, which are inherent to the design of the network itself, disqualify it from being the asset of the future, in my opinion.

Anyone else wonder if the powers that be have favorable views of crypto because they think they will be able to successfully co-opt it for their own benefit?

Looks more energy efficient than mining bitcoins at least.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:44:13
Do you need concrete numbers to know that harvesting a carrot is less energy intensive than mining a ton of gold? 
Keep digging and learning about alternatives and I'm certain you will eventually come to the same conclusion that I have that Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot survive long-term.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:05:02
Start from the beginning: do you want to support a system that uses absurd amounts of energy or not? Personally, I don't. I am looking at alternatives that are environmentally friendly. Bitcoin was brilliant, but it must die. We are living through the greatest ecological crisis in the history of humanity, and we cannot support anything that unnecessarily increases our impact on the environment. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:31:01
You tell me. Based on your research, which you claim is already very in-depth, how much energy does Bitcoin currently use?
It is too much compared to alternatives, like Holochain or Radix, which admittedly are new tech and have yet to be proven, but which would be many orders of magnitude more efficient than Bitcoin or Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:00:13
Doesn't add up or doesn't fit with your preconceived idea that Bitcoin's insane electricity usage is not a potential problem?
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:08:41
How did that movie end?
@_date: 2018-07-03 11:18:38
Because the disgusting concentration of Bitcoin wealth was somehow magically alleviated? Or because Bitcoin doesn't exist in the late 21st century?
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:14:55
You're right, no new energy is *needed* as adoption grows. That isn't the argument they are making. What they are saying is that as the price goes up, so does the incentive for mining, and therefore the increased profitability of mining causes an increase in energy usage. That's how I understood it.
