It doesn't have to drop to zero. If spending in general drops 10% it's a Depression.

Your job is most likely one of those "bullshit" expenditures.

People only need to spend on necessities. During deflation people do save, by making less optional purchases.

Good for the individual, bad for the overall economy. Until the individual is unemployed because of the depression, then it's bad for the individual as well.

All of them! The history of econ since the 30s has been accounting for all the ways people are not perfect Adam Smith robots.

That's only true for certain people. Most people are not investors. But everyone is loss-adverse, and deflation triggers that simply by seeing the price stickers change.

Sure. But we have to make policy decisions based on how the world actually is.

Lol. Spend some time in a 1930s breadline and tell me how good depressions are.

It's good for an individual. It's bad for an economy as a whole. All of those optional purchases are a massive part of the economy. During deflation those businesses shut down, people go unemployed, etc etc.  It's nice to think your money can buy so much, but when you have no job you have no money so it doesn't matter much.
Mass starvation's due to inflation? That's from hyper-inflation. Inflation by 1000% or more.  That's not what the Fed does. The Fed maintains 2% inflation because it is the grease that keeps the economy turning, to avoid a Great Depression.

Boom-bust has been an ever-present issue, all the way back to earliest economic history. Rome delt with boom and bust. 
Boom and bust cycles have actually gotten better since going to Fiat currency. With Fiat you have a tool, government spending, to give the economy a boost. The booms are not as high, and the busts are not as low. It's the exact opposite of "increasingly chaotic".

Under deflation you spend the bare minimum.

Loss-adversion. You see price stickers go down, you don't want to be the chump who buys just to see the price drop again. It causes saving in the cases that normally would not save.  It's not a theory, it's the proven facts of how people behave during deflation. 
Being bound and determined to save is entirely different.

You need to read those books again.
