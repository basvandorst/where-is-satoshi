So basically, BFL isn't really producing ASICS until we can "transform those ASICs into bitcoin" :)

I've tried bitfloor, mtgox, btc-e and now CampBX.  Bitfloor was good yesterday until they started having server problems too.  CampBX at least in the US is friggen great.  They will even take a personal check deposit...based out of atlanta, etc.  CampBX had no issues at all yesterday.

Pretty Common, needed to do it to get verified at MtGox too.  I had an issue w/ a deposit at Bitfloor which was completely my fault (didn't follow the instructions very carefully) and support @ bitfloor helped me out and straitened everything out.  They could have technically kept my money, bought beer and bacon but helped me instead.

Wondering what the neighborhood is like here...  Like in some S.A. countries, there are different zones.  Would not want to be in a crappy neighborhood.  Wonder if any locals can chime in?  50K USD would make a nice bitcoin early retirement home.

I like MtGox when it's not lagging...which today has been really tough.  Bitfloor is pretty good.  I like the Capone360 transfer (takes a few days) and the bank deposit stuff they have at Bitfloor better.  
You may just ask customer service if they have a more secure method of uploading files from their website.  At the time I sent my DL picture I was too kinda scared.

Love all the people trying to sell @ 200 and bring it down. Push Push!  Buy Buy! Next up $300

....and then fixed it and gained it all back in 3 hours

Yep I was supposed to get my coins last Thursday...about to file a dispute with the bank and never use these guys again.  They fooled me once and I gave them a second chance...

If I had a daughter, I would have at least cashed out in Fiat and set aside a fund for her education and the wedding that you'll probably end up paying for.  
Maybe even set up a nice trust fund for her and her kids...  Could have done something good with that.

It's growing pretty good.  Let's just say hypothetically it raises in value 10% a week...  Every week, that 10% is compounded making it rise up and up.  I wouldn't be surprised at current growth rate it get to 400-500 by the end of April...  Or it could all go to the crapper.  As always, invest what you can afford to loose and buy some nice beer as it rises up!
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:21:42
No.  Keep calm and mine on.

You wish you wouldn't have bought the yubikey and just used Google 2-factor
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:49:01
I need to figure out how to do this....  I just discovered reddit about a month ago 
+bitcointip 0.02btc verify
@_date: 2013-02-23 00:55:03
Yep.  This happened to me as well today.  Granted I was only buying 5 BTC, but it really made me upset.  I too setup two factor auth, had a big bank (USAA) tied in, etc.  I've bought 5BTC initially and was going to start investing in a few BTC a week.  If I have to wait 5 days, then get 'denied' what is that?  Why not tell me I'm high risk immediately.  
Anyway, removed all of my information from the site, bank account and cell phone info.  I'm moving to a verified MtGox + Dwolla for now...
@_date: 2013-02-23 02:28:16
Yep i used USAA for my first 5...then this today.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:52:51
Just setup google 2 factor on it.  You can make it so no one can withdraw without 2 factor...etc.  That being said having them in your possession is always best.  I usually withdraw into my private wallet though at the end of the day.

Cancelled my double jalapeno order a month ago.  Bought BTC instead at $40/share.  I could re-invest in BFL, but I want some sort of insurance that they will ship...ever.  Wish I went w/ Avalon.

HORRIBLE!!!!   Coinbase just cancelled one of my transactions after waiting 5 DAYS.  
On Feb 16, 2013 you purchased 5.00 BTC via bank transfer for $138.32.
Unfortunately, we have decided to cancel this order because it appears to be high risk. We do not send out any bitcoins on high risk transactions, and your bank account will not be charged.
Please understand that we do this to keep the community safe and avoid fraudulent transactions. Apologies if you are one of the good users who gets caught up in this preventitive measure - we don't get it right 100% of the time, but we need to be cautious when it comes to preventing fraud.
You may have more luck trying again in a few weeks. Best of luck and thank you for trying Coinbase.
Kind regards,
The Coinbase Team
Don't use this service!!!!

Dear Gox-
I've been in IT since the early 80's.  Yah...that was me...installing a commodore pet in my basement.  I'm not a programmer, because I think programmer's are nutcases, however most of my best friends are programmers.  The thing is, I know how to scale some stuff.  I'm a Unix dude before linux was a glimmer in Linus Torvalds's head, yet my calm demeanor has left me in many jobs throughout the years.  I witnessed the dot-com crash by working 72 hour days eating free pizza from my CTO's expense account, realized California sucked as far as traffic is concerned...and moved onto the midwest.
   You need to do something (if you already are not) like virtualization. Combine that with some server hardware like Cisco UCS/IBM Blades/ Dell Stuff... (IMHO Cisco has the lowest latency at the moment)...  So let's say you go w/ Cisco...have a service template...a bad ass storage array...and you're good.  EFD drives are your friend.  Crap...I dunno...this DDoS crap is just making me mad because you guys are / have the best trading engine thusfar.  I'm just sick of getting Gox'd every day.  ...oh and running out of whiskey.      
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:58:25
I have to be honest.  At first I thought it was one of those internet scams...not a lot on your website over a few posts, sad story about a guy dying...
Then I saw the additional photos on the website, the homeless dudes, and the tent city.  It sure was sunny there today in Pensacola and it wasn't from the sun.  You guys are doing a good thing.
Keep the photos coming.  Hope to donate as well sometime soon.

Would you be ok with me sending you 30BTC, mine with it for 6 months and then ship it to me?  If so, can I pay extra for expedited shipping when you're done using it?
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:17:26
satoshidice - wtf was I thinking.  Glad I learned early.

12 years later, Butterfly labs finally ships first 5 GHZ miner.  Mines .0002 BTC per month.

If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Thanks! Looks like new construction too...  Want to retire someplace in SA so bad...
