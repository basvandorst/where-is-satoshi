I get u but thats the whole point of my post. I understand that btc's value is pure speculation.  Im asking if im missing something on the tech side because like i said the tech is utter garbage from what i understand

Once again this doesnt answer my question. I know it has the first mover advantage. Im not talking about price. I am talking about the actual tech behind it and how it is vastly outdated.

Also i think calling for it to be used as a currency is doing nothing but hurting the value. When average joes start understanding the actual tech, the "currency" stance will be immediately destroyed and people will do just what i did and call it a shitcoin. Everyone needs to embrace the fact that btc is not the "currency of the future" but still has a place among other coins.

That doesnt answer my question at all

Forget price. Im not talking about price. I am legimately  asking u to correct me if im wrong on the following statement: btc is vastly outdated and should already be irrelevant if it wasnt for the first mover advantage and name recognition

This is the answer i was looking for and i agree compelely w everything u said. As ive gotten to learn more about it its clear its going to be a store of value. All the  dumbasses on this sub need to stop calling for it to be used as a currency. It could not be more obvious that it simply doesnt fit into that category

If u want bitcoin to succeed never call for it to be a replacement for fiat because itll never happen its not capable of it. It will never surpass its current role but it will grow in value and in users and theres nothing wrong w that just like how gold has its own niche

The uninformed buyers just get butthurt when u point out valid issues w bitcoin. If they were smart they would recognize the issues and realize something has to change.
