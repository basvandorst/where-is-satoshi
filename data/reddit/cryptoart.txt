[The Halving II (Moon or Bomb?)](
This is the sister edition to the “[The Halving]( created by artist Christina Hess in celebration of the Bitcoin Halving.  This piece represents the time period from the 2016 halving to the next halving in 2020 and comments on BTC price speculation.  Some suggest the reduction in Bitcoin inflation will create more scarcity and increase the price.  Others suggest a reduction in block rewards will reduce miner participation and make the network less secure.  The discussion seems ably illustrated as war-time propaganda.
The central element of this art piece is a rendition of the tally stick — an ancient device used to record debts between two parties.  A stick was marked to signify the debt, then broken and given to each party.  The larger half was given to the creditor and the short end given to the debtor.  Similar to the private-key to public-key relationship of cryptography, only one pair could be combined to verify the debt.  In this regard, tally sticks represent sound money by not contributing to fractional reserve banking.
These are fine art paper wallets (with exchangeable keys).

[Bitcoin Obituaries](
Bitcoin has “died” hundreds of times.  Bitcoin has been called a scam, a con, a ponzi, a pyramid, too inefficient, and too volatile.   On top of all the FUD, critics have cheered that if Bitcoin becomes too popular, governments will attack it. Yet for some reason, adoption, usage and the price continue to grow.  Bitcoin, the honey badger of money, lives and has thrived under constant attack.  That’s because, it’s a concept that recognizes the inalienable right to store and transact value.  Attack it, and it will use code and math to fork into something better and stronger! 
These are fine art paper wallets (with exchangeable keys).
@_date: 2019-07-20 04:38:45
The idea is that Bitcoin lives despite being under constant attack.
@_date: 2018-09-27 11:17:36
Not just early coins.  A certain amount of keys are continually lost.

Ever use Google Wallet to attach money to an email lately?  It's pretty slick.  Create an add-on that makes it this easy to attach BTC to email.
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:09:02
Yep. This is one of the challenges.  Others are... What investments to hold and how to index it? Who could you trust to manage it over time?  With Bitcoin, all that could be solved.  Everyone should buy one BTC and death lock it.  Sorry to coin a morbid term.
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:35:55
As a merchant that takes many coins, I would like to point out that part of the coin's utility is its liquidity.  I can safely accept a $1k transaction in LTC without much slippage if I'm converting to cash.  The marketplace and network effect will determine which coins should or shouldn't go away.
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:25:56
In your previous AMA, you described a chicken and egg problem with merchant adoption.  Quote:


It seems like Coinbase's new SHIFT card could be a huge step in the right direction.  Specifically, if card holders were allowed to earn cash (or BTC) back on eligible purchases.  As an example, Paypal has a debit card that pays 1% cash back.  I'm not up to date on interchange fees, but could there be a scenario in the future where we might see something like this?

Holy Hal!  I've always joked with my friends that I thought the key to eternal life might be a financial instrument.  My idea was to setup a trust that somehow beats inflation over time.  Given enough time, even a small amount compounded would be massive incentive to reanimate me assuming certain conditions were met.  I can't believe I never considered the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin.  Perhaps instead of being the new elite, we should settle for being eternal.

Also remember that all XCP was created via burning BTC.  So technically it is BTC, just trading at a different exchange rate.  Additionally, XCP transactions contribute BTC mining fees.

No, but often when volume is low you will see a spike down on Bitfinex and an increase in BTC swaps.  It shakes out the timid, but at some point equilibrium will be met.  Last week BTC swap rates where as high as dollar swap rates, so it may be soon.

The price is falling because 1) This is a natural part of the hype cycle.  We've been bouncing around this area for some time, eventually the slow rise will take over-- and we will have a wider ownership base.  2) We are still in a high distribution phase. Halving we be here soon. 3) The shorts on Bitfinex.  There is a clear correlation between outstanding BTC shorts and price drops.  Their tactics are becoming less effective however.  They actually got busted on the last spike.  These are my top three, obviously there are others.  All of this is just part of the a growing ecosystem.  I know it's frustrating, but we are building a strong foundation and soon the market will fully correct.

In the end, it will only work well if we have adequate order flow... so much that exchange rate slippage is less than processing fees from merchant accounts.  That means those market makers will hold it.  There is a finite supply, hence it becomes a good store of value.  I guess there is the whole velocity of money thing too.

XCP was created by burning BTC, so it's really just BTC that trades at a different exchange rate. Also, XCP transactions create fees for BTC miners.

My biggest fear is that other jurisdictions around the country will follow suit should the  pass as is.  How likely is this, even if it is deemed as heavy-handed?
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:40:13
There is so much transaction flow that exchange friction between Bitcoin and fiat is minimized. Right now merchants can exchange directly into fiat at no cost.  The savvy merchants offer discounts for this reason which offsets Bitcoin acquisition costs for the consumer.  In the end, total transaction costs need to beat traditional payment networks and this takes a lot of transactions. So, even if other cryptos have some advantages, the network effect makes Bitcoin more economically viable.

Here are a few pics from our exhibit at Comicpolooza.  Anecdotally, we found about 20% of the people had familiarity with Bitcoin. Familiarity in this case refers to only hearing the term and knowing that it is a currency, but not understanding how it worked.  At our SXSW exhibit, those numbers were up around 90%.  The inverse was true (only 10%) at a pop-up gallery we did in Memorial City Mall in Houston last month.  Oddly, we counted 6 people over a four day period that had heard of DOGE but not Bitcoin -- most were younger.
Lots of interesting Bitcoin stories out there. Stories of lost Bitcoin, missed opportunity, and unknown efforts that don't make the Reddit/Bitcointalk forums.  We talked to a guy that claimed he's raising money on a private placement to add 100 Petahashes to the network!
We sold about 80 pieces of Cryptoart at this event.  That's not huge, but it is growing.  We had two repeat customers. One person went home and researched Bitcoin and made a purchase on the last day. -- That feels nice.
From a retailer on the front lines-- the movement is growing, but it is still very early days.

[A Decade and Beyond](
Ten years ago the Genesis block set in motion a grand experiment. One that has been compared to the Internet. One that promises to end the monopoly of money creation by The State. From Pizzas, to dark markets, forks, debates on scaling, acts of charitable kindness, and acts of greed – the first decade of Bitcoin has been anything but boring. It’s the original blockchain blueprint, and the resulting technical and social journey it created has only begun.  What will happen over the next decade?

Hello moon walkers! Here is some new [Cryptoart]( for you by artist [Alix Branwyn]( If you would like to see the effort it took to create this, [watch the video](  
Note, link below goes to cryptoart.com (commercial):
[21 Million Bitcoin Club](
The 21 Million Bitcoin Club-- the new class of wealthy elite that becomes increasingly more difficult to join.  By design, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. If you hold the private key to a whole bitcoin, you control something scarce. 
The basic purpose of money is to serve as a measuring tool (unit of account) that can be exchanged to keep track of stored value.   It seems strange to inflate its supply to disincentivize saving and even stranger for the supply to be set by the whims of a few individuals. Yet, modern fiat currencies are issued in this manner.  They push an agenda that conflates real consumer wants with macro economic needs.  In this context, Bitcoin's hard cap challenges the notion that a currency can't be deflationary and that issuance requires policy set by monetary authorities.
Two things are certain: if you hold wealth in fiat, you will grow poorer over time.  If you hodl wealth in cryptocurrencies, you have opted into financial self-sovereignty.

I mention this because about this time before the last halving, Bitcoin was in a helpless bear market soon settling down to around $200; an 85% drop from its ATH.  Had you HODLed, you would have made 100x before the new ATH.  This is due to the compounding effect of traders speculating, miners hording, and organic demand outpacing the new supply.  Here's the history on this [art piece from the last halving](  (commercial link).

Good morning folks!  Here is some new Cryptoart for you. If you would like to see the effort it took to create this, [watch the video](
“pwned” is a mash-up of Day of the Dead and the crypto culture.  If Bitcoin had its own Day of the Dead, we would remember and remind ourselves that, while Bitcoin the transaction network is incredibly secure, central repositories are not.  Do not park your coins long-term with a third party!
These are fine art paper wallets (with exchangeable keys).

Desk looks circa mid-eighties.

Hi. All Cryptoart comes with a nominal amount of BTC included (notice the denominations on every one) to "initialize the address on the network."  The idea is that it reinforces the concept of art and money.  Additionally, we want to make Cryptoart a fun way to give BTC to those not so familiar with Bitcoin.  Pre-loading 12.5 BTC wasn't an option, but it is definitely confusing in this case.  Live and learn.

Glad you like the "BTC back" promo! Happy to answer questions about it.

They need a row for fees.

Cryptoart was invited by SXSW officials to host a pop-up gallery in the trade show.  As a thank you, we collaborated with Two Dots design studio in France to create a commemorative fine art wallet to give away at the show and online (S&amp;H applies).  Two Dots is know for their work on Assassin's Creed and Far Cry.  If you are going to SXSW, stop by our gallery in Hall 4 by the Trinity St. Entrance.  We'll be there Sun through Wed.  "Crypto Nouveau BxZ" is a Bitcoin wallet, but will come pre-loaded with BTC and ZRC (ZiftrCOIN).  Ziftr folks helped us with Two Dots.  Hope everyone likes it!

They've been short and leveraged for some time.

Be sure to check out the time-lapse video.  We're very thankful for the amount of time Christina spent on this art piece.

[Cryptoart]( was invited by SXSW to host a pop-up gallery in the tradeshow. It will be located along the wall in Hall 4 by the Trinity St. exit.  We will be distributing art loaded with BTC.  March 15 - 18.

Is nun with a Bitcoin gun positive? 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:58:05
Look forward to seeing everyone in SF.  We'll also be releasing a new art piece.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:06:34
Ask you shall receive.  Half off all order over $100:  use code: halvening.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:53:24
Thanks for the kind comments all!  I'll pass them to the artist.  A little about this art piece:
The central element of this art piece is a rendition of the tally stick — an ancient device used to record debts between two parties.  A stick was marked to signify the debt, then broken and given to each party.  The larger half was given to the creditor and the short end given to the debtor.  Similar to the private-key to public-key relationship of cryptography, only one pair could be combined to verify the debt.  In this regard, tally sticks represent sound money by not contributing to fractional reserve banking.

Hi. Cryptoart comes with a small amount of digital currency.  12.5 bits represents the halving.  This caused some confusion, so we actually updated this art piece to read BTC.  You'll be getting an email about this soon.  Thanks for posting!
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:56:17
Price is half of what it will be worth by the next halving ;).
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:36:31
Will do.  Thank you!
@_date: 2016-07-15 18:52:07
[Hell yeah!](  We've had several including SXSW (by invitation). It's fun but tough, and your voice will be hoarse by the end of the day.

Thanks for posting!  You beat me to it.  Now is a good time to join this club!
This is a follow-up to the [21 Million Club]( (those owning 1 BTC) we released last year. 
Note, link below goes to [cryptoart.com]( (commercial):
[The 1 Million Bitcoin Club](
**Inspiration:** By design, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. If you hold the private keys to 21 BTC, you are in the 1 Million Club. There will never be more than 1 million of these hardened hodlers.
The basic purpose of money is to serve as a measuring tool (unit of account) that can be exchanged to keep track of stored value.   It seems strange to inflate its supply to disincentivize saving and even stranger for the supply to be set by the whims of a few individuals. Yet, modern fiat currencies are issued in this manner.  They push an agenda that conflates real consumer wants with macro economic needs.  In this context, Bitcoin’s hard cap challenges the notion that a currency can’t be deflationary and that issuance requires policy set by monetary authorities.
Two things are certain: if you hold wealth in fiat, you will grow poorer over time.  If you hodl wealth in cryptocurrencies, you have opted into financial self-sovereignty.
These are fine art paper wallets (with exchangeable keys).

I've been in complete agreement historically, but the last few weeks, I've started to look at a different angle... Crypto led the broader markets down this year.  As something speculative, that seems reasonable.  My feeling is that the 6300 break was down rather than up partly from fear of a recession and rate hikes. However, we are correcting at such a dramatic pace, that at some point real buyers will move in regardless of outside concerns. There is a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that was made and will stay in crypto.   This creates a floor while the rest of the world takes time to sell off.  The irony would be that the volatile nature of crypto is what decouples us - or at least creates the spark.
This a lot of assumption and even more dreaming of course.      
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:29:59
Unless Bitcoin reaches non-correlated asset status.  It may not be that far off.  If we stabilize in this range while the broader markets have a prolonged sell off, all the while gaining traction in these hyper inflation markets, it could happen.

Stop by our booth at the Texas Bitcoin Conference! ChangeTip the artist here: 
edit-- BTW-- This is a fine art paper wallet.  It is cold storage for bitcoin.  Not only is this art with utility, it is a physical merger of art, technology, money, war, and religion (although in a non-serious cyperpunk sense).  Enjoy.
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:43:37
Embrace your addition and figure out ways you can push it onto others.  Works for me.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:55:04
Agreed.  Cryptoart is created so that the QR code and private key can be switched out without damaging the art piece.  
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:22:18
Nope. [People were asking]( for a version for the 1 Million Club.
