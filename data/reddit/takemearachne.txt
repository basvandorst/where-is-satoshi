Bread automatically calculates how much it would take for your transaction to get included in the next few blocks. If the transaction fees are high af at that moment, it'll be a high transaction fee. Unfortunately, it appears they don't let us set this ourselves.

How do you re-apply it?
Let's say, for example, the price of bitcoin goes to $1,000,000 and this coin is worth over $10,000,000. I am sure there's a way to systematically prove the seal's adhesive was removed and a different adhesive took the place of the original. Maybe something chemically speaking.
I'm not an expert in this regard, obviously, but in a similar way art is appraised and verified I'm sure these coins can be. It would be much easier to do that appraisal in person, as well. For what it's worth, the [coin _is_ still unclaimed]( You can't verify the previous owners didn't copy the private keys or destroy the seal from an online auction, though.

You should listen to [this guy](
Don't sell it all at once. Move half to an exchange and get your rent back from the BTC when you pay your rent with fiat.
It's money you just recently came into, so it's not "more than you can afford to lose" because you were getting by without it. Try to be a little more risky with half while being more safe with the other half.

Bitcoins fees are supposed to be minimal, and right now they're about 4.5¢. Of course as the price raises the value of the transaction fee raises. It used to be 0.01 BTC for a transaction fee, which would be silly now because that's 4.40$

You can buy new blocks if the coinbase was sent to a wallet with one address: the address that received the coinbase.

Only thing worse than arrogance is arrogant stupidity. If you deposit 1,000$ and a bank is required to have 10% in reserves, they loan out 900$ and keep the 100$.  Then the 900$ is deposited to another bank, and 810$ is loaned out and 90$ is kept in deposits. 
Calculusly speaking, the amount of money created approaches a limit of 10x. Just do the math yourself and you'll see on paper rather quickly how the amount of money a deposit of 1000$ creates a total of 10,000$ increase in money supply. 
This is similar to a Fibonacci sequence, where 1 + 1/2 + 1/4... etc approaches a limit of 2 but we use 10 in our reserve requirement case. 
I think before you act arrogant towards other people's corrections of your statement, you should revisit your Economics 101 notes.

Buy 0.25 BTC at 650$; 162.50$
Buy 0.25 BTC at 750$; 187.50$
Total cost for the BTC is 595$. You could have saved by going all in at 450$ or 550$, but you lose less than going all in at 750$. 
Additionally, you smooth your spending, which is generally what a rational consumer wants to do. The prices at 700$+ were very brief, so you can't have had dollar-cost averaged only at those levels. If you bought in above 700$, buying at lower than 700$ brings the average cost lower.

Fake transactions generally never get a confirmation. If you get a confirmation, it drastically reduces the risk of a false transaction. If you're trading under $100,000, generally 1 confirmation should be fine because the cost to attempt to reverse this transaction will be much higher than that. Additionally, it'll become even more difficult to reverse the transaction as it gets even more.
If you see the person give you BTC from their phone, you should be fine with no confirmations. You need a farm to be able reverse transactions... something most people at Starbuck's don't have readily available.

I'm not familiar with this feature. If you create a paper wallet offline, there isn't a switch that allows one to send BTC to the address on the receipt paper. You simply create the private and public key pair that allows you to spend the BTC in that address.

You can send BTC to addresses that 'do not exist' yet, which means that no one has found the private key to the public key (aka the bitcoin address). Essentially, all addresses that can be created already exist - it's just the private key has not been created to match an address, yet.
If you send BTC to 1MrEossMrEossMrEossMrEossMrEoss, you will *most likely not be able to retrieve the BTC*; however, if you were to find the private key to this address, you can spend the BTC in that address.

No one at Starbuck's is going to have that readily available. For the record that's very possible if the attacker has the hash power, but no one you meet at Starbuck's for an in-person bitcoin transaction will do that to you.

Bitcoins current inflation is 9% or 14%. I can't remember which, exactly. It does have an inflation rate and its much larger than fiat right now; however, it halves every halfing. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 09:12:22
Monetarily speaking, the transaction fee adjusts as the blockchain grows. It used to be 0.005 BTC as a fee. Now it's 0.0001 BTC. The difference is the former 0.005 BTC was when BTC was 10$ (so the fee is roughly 5¢) where the latter 0.0001 BTC is when BTC is 300$ (so the fee is 3¢). Besides, transaction fees are generally 0.1 BTC added to the coinbase. Over the period of a day, that's roughly 14.4 BTC split to all miners. 
Later in BTC's lifetime, say 20 years, we will have seen an additional estimated 5 block reward halvings. This would put the reward at 0.8 BTC and (assuming perfect economics) would put BTC at 8960 USD (280*2^5). We would probably see fees accounting for way more than 0.1 BTC. At 0.0001 BTC we see 0.1 BTC so roughly 1000 fees (1000 transactions of 0.0001 BTC per block). 20 years later, we may see as much as 30-40x the daily transactions and at 8960 USD/BTC we would need a fee of 0.000005 BTC to equate to 0.05¢. 0.000005 BTC *(30,000-40,000) = 0.15 BTC to 0.2 BTC (but now the value of the fees is 1300-1800 USD worth). But of course, most people believe that 8960 USD/BTC is actually attainable in the next 10 years, so it's possible that the value of BTC can be upwards of 20,000 USD/BTC (if it truly succeeds) and the fees can actually account for 2500-4000 USD of the block rewards.
On another note, however, miners don't need a substantial reward for their efforts, especially when other backbones such as nodes are run for *free* and receive *nothing* in return.

If you hold all your BTC in a wallet on a server (or any device that can found around you) that's designed to facilitate the sale of narcotics and your operation gets busted, they're going to take those BTC.

@_date: 2015-07-21 21:32:30
Well, if you buy one, you'd have to purchase the BTC to stock the ATM with. Then you'd have to sell those BTC to yourself at a 3% premium or whatever. At least, I would imagine that you would have to 'sell' the BTC from the ATM to yourself so 'on paper' it doesn't look like those BTC are still part of the ATM's inventory (you probably would also buy the ATM's BTC with a card or bank transfer or something, so you'd want to get those 'sold' to you for cash or something. It would be an asset exchange, really).

It means that bShowAddressForm will always be assigned false, unless the billing country is the US. The order of false before the || (or) means that bShowAddressForm will evaluate to false unless the right side is true, which in that case bShowAddressForm would be assigned true. It's useful because of assignment. I like it too, it looks clean.
Thinking of it like human language: "bShowAddressForm is false, or true if billing country is US"

You don't have to send the 0.00001 BTC *recommended* transaction fee... which would be 2.32% at today's price. It just helps to confirm your transaction faster.

*Supposedly*, the economy anticipates the upcoming price change and slowly adjusts itself to the new inflation rate. So, price won't (based on today's price) go from 450$ to 900$ on July 11th, but rather go gradually from 450$ to 900$ between now and then.

Some people get paid in bitcoin and coinbase charges a 1% fee to exchange it to USD. While options are limited now (paying for your utilities, for example), this allows you to do that directly. When you're paying your gas or utilities, you really aren't worried about being tracked. You can still use a mixer to buy other things, however, and you're not required to only use this card.
While I agree its not the best option, it's the best option we have available for using it in many places. Your regular CC is already able to be tracked, this is no different of course. It just uses your BTC instead.

@_date: 2016-05-24 20:03:20
Gold is also more tricky. Gold production has been around since thousands of years BCE, and we're getting to the point where all the 'easy' gold has been mined. Either way, gold price is not dictated so much by production as it is by the demand for it, the amount banks hold in their reserves, and the value of the dollar and gold's use as a hedging tool. If the price of gold went up, it becomes profitable to mine it. If it goes down, then mines shut down. So in gold's case, mines are more likely to react to the price rather than the other way around.

I would rather say it's not safe to consider those BTC are yours, yet. Although they've been cryptographically assigned to you, they're not confirmed and, therefore, not totally considered yours yet. I would also say it's not (not safe) to spend the BTC, as the real issue is whether they're yours (yet) or not.
Also &gt; at 1 confirmation, your transaction will almost always gain additional confirmations on the next blocks. You will never see a malleable transaction with two 1 confirmation transactions - always 1+ unconfirmed and 1 confirmed.

You didn't intentionally deceive the seller to gain an upper hand and the seller had no knowledge of the value of what was on the hard drives.
I remember reading an article about someone who bought a plate for 3$ at a garage sale and it turned out to be worth 2.3$m, and the original owner was not entitled to any of it. Many people go estate/garage sale surfing to look for items that are valued at far less than they're worth. This case is no different, so you should keep the money.
If the kin would have known the bitcoin on the drive was worth 1000$ and you coerced them into thinking it was worth far less, then you would have done something illegal; however, the kin sold you the computer at a price you two agreed upon. It's a done-deal.

Well, what he's saying is that if you buy bitcoin at 1$, when it increases 1$ you have a 2x increase. When it's at 1,000$, however, 1$ is much less of an increase if you have 1 BTC vs 1,000 BTC.

Well, Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonymous name, so there is no reason that he would have to out himself to three major news outlets to prove that he *is* Nakamoto. I remember reading about a deal regarding [a large amount of bitcoins &amp; gold and that the person did not deliver like they promised]( so that part I could understand not being able to hide; however, I couldn't imagine that a tax investigation would be reason to out yourself as Nakamoto. 
When you take a look coinbases from early blocks, they're still not spent.
[Block 2 coinbase address](
[Block 3 coinbase address](
It would be hard to believe that Mr. Wright sent 380,000 BTC and none of these coinbases are moved. In fact, he says he used the address Nakamoto used to send 10 BTC to Finney. That address, which follows, still has a positive BTC balance and hasn't been used since 2009.
[First Bitcoin Transaction](
Wright claims that he has the keys to the address where Nakamoto sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney. Well, he's a lying sack of shit. The first transaction sent to Hal Finney was in [block 170](
[Block 9]( only has the coinbase transaction of 50 BTC. No transactions whatsoever.
[Additionally, Hal Finney began mining at Block 70](

It's outrageous but the people investing don't want to buy Bitcoin themselves and they're under the impression that they'll see 100x gains in their investment based on past performance. 
These people would be left with ~$87,000 worth of 'BTC' (quotes because they don't own the BTC) if they invest $100,000 and 15% goes to set-up. But if their 'BTC' increases in value 100-fold, they now have $8.7m and that $13,000 is peanuts now. 
Then they see John McAfee telling the public he'll eat his dick if BTC isn't $500,000 in three years and they think, "Wow that billionaire says this thing is worth like 225x as much, so I should invest!"

Now, when my BTC makes me a multimillionaire, I'll probably be putting some of it into the stock market so I can get about 4000$ a month in dividends. That'll be my form of 'cashing out' (but more realistically, diversifying assets to generate some revenue).
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:24:21
I think the biggest disconnect is that you're looking at Bitcoin like a stock, where if there is a halving then there would be 0.5x the amount of Bitcoin, which is not the case -- it is a halving of the inflation (effectively). Since there is a halving of the inflation and a stagnation of money supply, then the value of BTC goes up relatively. If there is a stagnation of BTC and USD inflates by 100%, then the price of BTC would also rise in price relative to the USD (as would other currencies, while BTC remains constant in price relative to the other currencies). The price can't go up if people can still make money at these prices and undercut people who try to anticipate a higher price.
There is, of course, another point that Bitcoin is a honey badger, doesn't give a fuck, and does it what wants.
