I agree. Be loyal only to yourself. If you think you’ve made enough money to pull yourself and your family out of poverty, then do it. If you’re in your 20’s, go for riskier options, losing is healthier when you’re young. If you have people dependent on you, be more cautious and factor them into your financial decisions.

My main point here is to be more cautious of your financial decisions if you have people dependent on you. How is that terrible advice?

Wow. So, the layering design pattern is as old as arpanet. I honestly thought the Controller-Service-Dao was the first layering implementation.

I see. And, since halving still occurs, it means we have not yet mined all BTC’s?

So, you realized you now have 0 BTC, and then you contacted support, and then they said you have a virus in your PC where you got hacked? It that the timeline of events?
