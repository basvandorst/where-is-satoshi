the only point I was making was that btc doesn't work if everybody holds out to dump.... I really look at it as diversification at this point.. I wouldn't want to have all USD and neither should you LOL. speculation or not

The 'goal' is to spend it later. That is the only way BTC thrives.. It has to be accepted practically everywhere to ever be worth the 1m it could be.

100+Billion and holding... I think we are really coming out of the speculation phase. That dump from 19,5k to 5.9k shook alot of speculation out.. The two smaller concurrent dumps are finishing it up. Soon we will find a new bottom. Enough people have already agreed 1 BTC is worth more than $5900.

Lets all hope for the precious LN. LOL... Im, glad we agree on the USD thing I do believe if the US dollar falls BTC/USD will increase drastically. Although it wouldn't necessarily be worth more if the dollars are worth less.. 
take the hopes of 1M btc out of the equation.. If Bitcoin was to grow 10% in 5 years it would have been good diversification &amp; less of a lottery ticket. I do believe 10% is very gracious on the minimum side with all due respect to bitcoin bears.

World GDP PPP is 126T &amp; Climbing every year..  if 0.25% of that cant make it into Bitcoin over 4 years.. What are we doing here? Lol.
Nice post tho OP

your math is correct. Only if every coin mined is dumped... Currently Electricity is about 3/4 of daily mining rev.. So Youre atleast off by 1/4th... If people are still mining to accumulate after paying electric costs. and @ 1mil/BTC im sure the profibility will be much higher... So im sure more than 1/4  of that 1.3 trillion will be held on to.
Side note.. 1.314 T injected into bitcoin in 4 years is not impossible nor far fetched
