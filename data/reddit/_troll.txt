They will be soon enough; who in their right mind is going to continue using Bitfinex in the future, when there are other exchanges out there?

Explain that logic to me, really.
Is an exchange that's gone through 2 separate hacks better than one that's gone through only 1?
Any time this happens, if it's not an inside job, it boils down to incompetence. There are illegal dark markets, run by anonymous figures, that have existed for years that have never suffered a catastrophic hack of this nature, but apparently some people expect less of Bitfinex.

I've used VanityGen (i.e., not a website) to create a paper wallet in the past.

Could they ever voluntarily decide to reduce it to 20 million to make their ~~holdings~~ hodlings worth more?  :)

Sorry, but this crap is really screwing things up for a lot of people using services where they can't set their own fee.
I have a pending transaction now for almost 4 hours, where the transaction size is about 1200 bytes, and the fee was (automatically set) at about 0.000125 BTC. I had no control over the fee. Do I need a confirmation instantaneously? No. But I worry what happens if it still hasn't been confirmed after 24+ hours, if it gets returned to the input wallet, the coins won't be in my possession because it's the service's wallet, not mine.
It's patently obvious which transactions are spam. Anyone sending more in TX fees than the actual transaction amount should be treated as a zero fee transaction and bumped to the back.

I've been waiting on a transaction with slightly over 0.0001 BTC/kB fees for almost 30 hours now.
It's actually a higher fee, and a lower size, than the OP's transaction.
I could not set the miner's fee from the service I was using. This is absolutely maddening.

Sent you a PM.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:03:02
I'll PM you, but we both already know what's delaying it: the fee/kB isn't high enough to leap past the thousands of spam transactions, and it can't be retroactively changed.
@_date: 2015-07-09 04:52:04


Well, I've been waiting 25+ hours for a very "real", non-spam, transaction to get its first confirmation, so whatever algorithm they're using to determine what constitutes a "real" transaction is not functioning properly. Yes, it has fees slightly higher than 0.0001 BTC per kB. I couldn't set the fee. Yesterday it was "medium priority". Today it's said "high priority" for at least 8 hours. **Non-technically minded people shouldn't even have to concern themselves with details like this.**
And I know: "complain to the wallet service to change their fee scheme". Done, but it's too late.
I hope this is worth $5,000 or $10,000 to whoever is doing this. You realize that when the attack money runs out, ultimately nothing will have been accomplished. Money well spent?

meh, I've been here for 9 months.  :)

Can you actually expedite the initial confirmation? I don't know what's to investigate, there are many many other day-old transactions besides mine that remain unconfirmed, with miner fees that would have seen it in the next block just a few days ago.

And what if said users increasingly demand, or recognize the need for, a floating block size?

How are you supposed to conduct a transaction on LBC without at least temporarily depositing to the LBC wallet?

Does anyone here know if the latest version of Mycelium (2.5.4) has the same feature? Does this mean it's all but impossible to "malleate" a transaction? I ask because a few weeks back I sent a transaction using v2.5.2 and it was double-spent, which ended up temporarily causing problems.
@_date: 2015-10-04 10:00:27
What exactly is the *point* of the TX malleability attack, if it doesn't allow theft of bitcoins? If attacker is trying to double-spend their own bitcoins, why modify other random people's transactions?!
God damn, this is screwing up bitcoin services that rely on a certain # confirmations to credit deposits, which is practically every bitcoin service. Everything from LocalBitcoins to, yes, darknet markets. Stuff like this shows that bitcoin is nowhere near ready for prime-time. Random users shouldn't even have to know what a "TXID" or "double spend" even is.

So... Samson Mow represents a consortium of all bitcoin miners?
