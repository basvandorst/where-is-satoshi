Glad you're safe! TREZORS are indeed pretty tough I dropped mine quite a few times from my desk and nothing really happened to it except it started getting scratched and pretty dirty, so I bought a silicone Protective Case for it.

For those asking about the Silicone Protective Cases:

@_date: 2017-12-24 23:16:58

@_date: 2017-12-15 13:32:43

Trezor can be pimped with these Silicone Covers too...5 colors

It's just another business like many others out there...I received my order with a sweet hand written thank you card. They seem like they're just hustling...we shouldn't always be paranoid

How does 14 USD represent a quarter of the price of a TREZOR which costs over a 100 USD? A TREZOR wallet wld have to cost 56 USD if we follow ur calculations
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:50:19
I just checked and they do ship to North Korea lmao

Who said? A TREZOR is simply meant to secure ur private key, you choose whether you want to HODL, or not, part or all of ur cryptos.

I ordered me a blue one and a black one
