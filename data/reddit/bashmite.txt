That would be too simple, the average person could understand what they're doing then. Talk about "reserve lending" and "quantitative easing" instead and everyone thinks it must be something complicated.

It's not my choice to get a refund. If overstock called back your pants and you had to get the pants elsewhere I would expect you to refunded enough to buy them elsewhere. I can't buy a lifetime 2TH/s contract off them for $298 worth of BCH.

Not completely true, the reason why cloud mining should be a thing that should work is quite simple.
If you take 90 cents on the dollar but have the money upfront instead of waiting two years this allows for more explosive growth. As you can continually buy more hardware and sell it instantly at a profit, while improving your brand and gaining more hash rate and becoming a bigger miner in the space.

Estimated end of April not guaranteed. Either way that's large % of the profitable period of the contract.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:51:12
They're not paying the fee to get the money to me lol, that's out of my "earnings". Now I already have BTC which I need to withdraw so on top I now need to pay Bcash fee
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:16:10
Its a shame, I thought I had been lucky because I was on track to break even in 6 months (taking into account difficulty increases) because the daily fee had been in USD and BTC had increased in price.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:53:08
pool.bitcoin.com charge a withdrawal fee
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:35:05
This is exactly what I'm trying to explain. The refund only buys you back 1/6th of the hashrate if the contract starts now, they're lifetime contracts so it doesn't matter when they start. 
It should be bought back at market rate or what was paid, I would bet these two numbers are extremely similar.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:26:20
The BCH refund is only 0.1608 BCH. Nowhere near the 0.089 BTC investment. Even with the earnings from mining I'm massively down.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:06:23
I'm going to be paying a fee to withdraw what BTC i have in there anyhow so I now have to pay 2 fee's. Good point.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:24:52
Not true the fees where agreed ahead of time in USD on a daily basis because bitcoin increased in price for the last 6 months I was still earning relatively a similar amount to when it started.
Hence I was on track to break even, now I'm looking at a loss and I'm not the only one.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:54:56
Not true I paid in Bitcoin? I didn't pay in dollars. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:08:28
Did you buy in BTC or USD? I wouldn't have been bothered if I bought with USD. I'd be up, would have been up more just holding BTC.
But I paid in BTC so I could make a profit in BTC and was on track to.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:44:16
Smart wish I had thought of that!
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:14:32
How is that true. A refund should be in the currency it was made, not the currency that suits?
Under that logic it would have been completely reasonable for him to refund me 0.089 BTC in Zimbabwe Dollar valued at the time of my purchase.
One's a currency that's completely inflated while another has deflated.

Block size increase helps LN, the blockchain will need bigger blocks at some point for LN regardless of traditional bitcoin transactions. This talk from the LN white paper devs tells you what you need to know in terms of how LN helps scale. It clearly states the need for bigger blocks to allow adoption of LN to grow.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:04:26
So any discussion you don't like is spam. 
Maybe you should stick "to the moon" threads
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:42:00
LN adds a huge burden at first though to the blockchain, all we're going to see is spiraling fee's to get channels setup which will reduce LN adoption and possibly prevent it reaching the size it needs to.
Good talk on blocksize requirements for LN 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:30:34
The best way to scale lightning network up fast is to reduce fees so channels can be opened cheapily and easily by everyone.
So I fully agree with everything you've said above. I can't see how with 1MB blocks lightning can scale up to the masses if it costs so much to just open your first channel. That's assuming if everyone limits themselves to one channel, lightning works better if everyone can open lots of channels so we have a completely decentralised network rather than big hubs everyone is connected to.
1MB blocks will make big hubs the only option and will probably not scale at all as majority won't move off chain to LN.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:17:59
LN will require larger blocks anyhow. Opening a channel will create a larger transaction than your typical transaction. LN without larger blocks will not solve anything as to get critical mass and "enough" channels open will take forever with blocks limiting it.
Check out the first part of the video on  it goes into details on the size requirements of on chain vs off chain
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:39:41
This never gets enough attention/discussion.
As you've said there's lots more that we can put into a hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:23:22
How can you get widespread adoption if each block can only open maximum around 1000 channels a time and this is forgetting about all the other ongoing transactions its already attempting to handle. Basically there's going to be more and more spiralling of fees when LN comes out because of everyone competing to open channels.
In my mind this prevents the average Joe being able to get started with LN for quite some time.

You need to open your channel on the blockchain to use LN as well. These transactions are bigger than your average transaction so will be costly to do.
LN isn't the simple fix everyone thinks it is if the blockchain still limits it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:02:07
I agree with both of your first statements of course. No need to jump up to massive blocks but 2MB - 8MB blocks are needed now and will help LN adoption. 
When I say now I know these things will need to go through months and months of testing hence why they need to start being worked on and deployed to the testnet etc. 
I think a lot of people are under the impression that blocks can always be 1MB with LN and this is just not the case. We need a mixture of techniques in the pipeline!  
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:17:45
I agree you don't rush into bad decisions, but you definitely implement temporary fixes when the more complete solution is in the works. 
What makes a temporary block size increase a bad decision, either way its a win win. The quicker LN is the less time we have big blocks, if LN is longer we have the blockspace to keep Bitcoin useful (for more than buying Lambo's). Everyone wins regardless of the progress of LN.
And how is the block size relatively minor, relative to what? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:34:03
Trust me I have no interest in joining the fanatics over at I just want a bitcoin that works, the bitcoin we had worked but we failed to organise and agree and do in time what was necessary.
I think this a case of hindsight is 20/20, you're probably right its quite possible that its too late to do this now. Its just frustrating it took so long to get to this point when the problems were being discussed so long ago. I suppose whether its too late or not really does depend on when LN will be in usable and implemented across enough of the industry. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:36:52
LN still requires bigger blocks to scale. 
Educate yourself here 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:08:44
LN will require on chain transactions to open channels. When its released you won't all of a sudden just be able to send money cheap.
You will need to open channels to build the network, opening channels are big transactions and considering everyone is going to be trying to do it the 1MB blocksize will be even worse. Opening channels will cost more and more as everyone outbids each on price.
The only solution to get LN adoption up quickly and cost effectively is a block size increase.
Check the video out here it discusses it  and its by the guys who wrote the LN paper.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:11:36
Educate yourself about LN block size requirements. Do me a favour don't just insult people because they have a different opinion to you, because thats precisly what this community doesn't need.
LN video  from LN white paper devs, block size requirements discussed

LN requires bigger blocks to scale as well
See talk here 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:01:28
It only excludes everyone running a fully validating node if the blocks are filled up. If a block size is 8MB it would probably take quite a while before they're full and LN would offer the cheaper and faster alternative once your have your channels setup anyhow.
Blocksize changes need a hard fork as far as I know and we should limit the amount of hard forks as low as possible as there is risk. Theres been talk in the past of dynamic block sizes which increase over time or something which could be the solution.

The problem with waiting for the wallets to implement is we're not getting any immediate improvements.
If we had Segwit 2 years ago and it was getting to the point of 75% adoption we might be doing okay now.
But we didn't, failing to get it out in time and the failure on behalf of the wallets implementing in time means we need to react now. A block size increase is needed immediately. In software development, you don't wait till something becomes a problem to fix it, you fix it well in advance so its never a problem. The block size has been a problem for how long now? I understand all the reservations regarding about keeping bitcoin as decentralised as possible (I run 6 nodes across different servers), but we still need to react now. There's nothing preventing the blocksize being reduced again in the future once LN is in full affect and Segwit adoption is right up. 
LN is passing all its tests now, that doesn't mean it will definitely be out in the next few months. Who knows, it could be 18 months away.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:26:00
Development starts with discussion so I don't see your point. There will be very few on here with the skills and experience who are not already involved in the bitcoin github. 
To motivate those who aren't, the community needs to offer some direction right? This isn't about what the Devs who can work on Bitcoin want, its about what the community wants.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:33:04
I used to believe the same, but it can't be temporary after further research. LN requires bigger blocks to scale still, see the start of this talk on the lightning website. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:11:24
We've had a lot of negative discussions in the past about block sizes. But why is anyone who suggests increasing the block size automatically a shill? We need to stop this negative reception to any discussion on Bitcoin and its direction.
Unless everyone referring to OP as a shill thinks that lightning developers are shills to?
I suggest people watch the video on  and learn that a blocksize increase will be needed for lightning to scale to the size it needs to.

Iota withdrawals are bugging out on bitfinex. IOTA team been working with bitfinex on solution.
BTC and ETH are currently being withdrawn in bulk causing their hot wallet to run dry which keeps needing replenishing. The queueing system for the withdrawals looks to be biggest first, not first come first serve. Hence if you withdraw a large amount you will see it happen quickly. Smaller amounts &lt; 1 BTC are taking forever
