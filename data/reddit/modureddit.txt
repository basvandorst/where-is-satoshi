Exactly. So I would you call that a national license? It makes no sense.
@_date: 2016-04-25 13:28:30
I'm not a anti-government nut, I understand the value of the current due process. What I am asking is, again, what does "Nationally licensed in Europe" mean?
@_date: 2016-04-25 13:28:51
That's even worse.

What the hell does that mean? Nationally licensed in Europe? Let me guess, Bitstamp is from the US?

I partially agree with you on the core but why must we be hostages of 3rd parties for a decent interface? I'm not talking about eye candy, but an actual, decent and informative GUI.
You've just reaffirmed what I said, you use the CLI because:
A) It's your job.
B) The GUI in the stuff you use doesn't work (hence the no choice part).
C) For repetitive tasks and automation it's much faster, although it has a very high learning curve.

SSDs aren't dumb writing machines, only the first generation had such fears and now they theoretically will outlast every HDD you have. Get that misinformation out of your head, or at least look a bit more deeply into it.
tl;dr: You have no reason to worry about it. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 13:29:02
It doesn't help that most contributors actually do not care at all about the interface.
@_date: 2015-12-29 10:32:41
You might be on to something, as software development on Linux is fragmented as hell, corresponding to the importance of the network effect.

Web interfaces are from the last decade, application GUIs are more relevant than ever, thanks to apps: mostly because web interfaces almost always suck.

Not for technical users, but it is for the rest of the world (99%). And technical users will just compile their own -no-gui versions and be happy.
Bitcoin is not just another program to apt-get, it's meant for worldwide use by the masses. Do you want everyone except linux geeks to use SPVs and not give their share in providing resilience to the network?
@_date: 2015-12-16 14:41:36
Despite your emotional response, I actually thank you for the food for thought.


Maybe. But you're the one who said:




You do not know my background or my field of expertise to make such claims.


You're assuming we're talking about a zero sum game. The people who work on interfaces are not the same who work on core functionality.


Barriers to entry significantly affect adoption, do you deny that?


I must be running up to 3 years now. I started on 2011 until I moved house and recently had the capacity to have a node running 24/7 again. I was one of the stupid suckers who lost a few bitcoins because of my dead hard-drive.
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:17:44
Cute analogy, since most people don't care whatever kernel runs their OS, they just want to use the software. Android provided software and usability. Bitcoin provides, in my opinion, mediocre usability on a solid core, hence I would say current bitcoin is like Ubuntu.

@_date: 2015-12-16 16:07:16
I agree with you.
I'm not saying that only Linux users use CLI, I'm saying that Linux user *HAVE* to use CLIs because most distros and open-source software either isn't designed to be used in any other way (valid for server software and small dependencies) or just quarter-ass the GUI entirely.
I've had to go to the terminal in modern distros to change the mouse sensitivity, it can be ridiculous.

Academic stuff is the super computers. "Almost all servers", ugh, no, catch up on some statistics please. Not saying it's a good thing, but don't ignore reality (or base it only a few select sources).
Yeah, I don't buy the "more cores" running because on most of them (Android) almost everything had to be rebuilt and even after years of exclusive development from a big company, it's still the hoggiest, slowest and battery slurping kernel running on any mobile phone.

I'm not involved in the Bitcoin core and have no economics degree so I'll abstain from making unfounded suggestions to those who are involved, so I don't really care for your argument, wherever it may point. I do have the knowledge and experience in development to try and stop open-source crazies from taking over bitcoin's core development by their usual hate for the user and complete inability so simply work at a problem, instead of bickering for months and forking and forking and the software only gets worse.

Yeah, just like my bank app requires me to use the fucking powershell to check my transaction log... oh wait, they actually take into account that I might not be a fucking IT engineer and thus not even know what the hell a terminal is.
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:01:04
I can point out a few things:
* It's slow to boot and even slower to close. God help us if you want to close it mid-indexing or db update.
* It's unresponsive and locks for seconds when performing operations such as transactions.
* It's not very intuitive on what does what, although it is usable.
* Simple things like checking a balance can be way to complicated, especially when the DB is not up to date.
* Tracking the detailed status of a transaction requires an external source (blockchain.info is the most used and we all know how they fuck up a lot of things).
* Transaction fees are a weird combination of unexplained and devoid of information regarding their current state (fees change based on network activity).
* Main screen could provide much more information, especially regarding your client status.
* Tracking addresses and labels is very complicated, even Electrum suffers in this regard. Very little has been done if you want to preserve this meta-information between wallets/installation.
That's what I can get out the top of my head, I'm sure if I sat down and analyzed it I would get much more.
@_date: 2015-12-16 14:19:12
I agree with you and that's the sad part. We're stuck with either botched functionality and less security or a 1980's interface.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:28:33
Fantastic, but I knew of these things before starting working in the IT industry 10 years ago.
The Linux kernel is a very nice piece of engineering. One of the best jobs I had was full-linux based.
But Linux as an OS is completely relegated servers or to a kernel running very deep in layers of temporarily compatible software.

Interviews? Asking Google? That's your source? Get out of tech-crunch and see how the real world is.
I know Google is big, but to claim they are whole world is, at best, a large overstatement or, again, trying to fit you narrative.
Why should anyone care that Google has more OSes based on Linux? No one uses Chrome OS, that's why they're developing a new one that's not just a glorified browser. Which is funny, because linux end-users (not admins or servers) actually don't have much choice but do everything in the browser because the software is either non-existing or is just terrible.
According to the [Linux Foundation]( the server share is actually rising, almost at 80% which is expected: as you say, it doesn't make economic sense anymore to buy licences. Instead, now you buy support.

@_date: 2015-12-16 15:53:15
Agreed. But wouldn't you agree also that it would improve the network to have many more full wallets running, instead of mostly SPVs? I would like to work towards that.
Thankfully I'm blessed with 200 Mbit connections in my country and the rest of Europe will soon follow. Not sure about the US, where the telecoms have a stranglehold on network connections.
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:04:41

Well defined tests have shown that typical usage will last decades. If your specific workload is incompatible with modern wear-levelling it's a big bummer. Did you use first generation SSDs or more modern ones?

That would be the best way to go. You can have the headless services with no fluff and the a nice GUI.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:17:17
Maybe that's because the 1MB keeps getting too close to full and a full block will start to mess with the network and has the potential to break Bitcoin's network effect. It's serious business, not an abandonware open-source project where nothing ever gets done.

Of course it is on Windows, that's my point. The difference is on how do you fix it? Printer mal-function? Download latest drivers from maker and just click to run and install. Better yet, let windows update it for you. Problems in boot? Windows boot fixer, just pop in the install DVD and touch nothing. Bad drivers? One click system restore to point before driver installation.
How do you fix these types of issues on Linux, currently? That's right, MAN pages, forum threads, obscure command lines, editing cryptic files, follow random advice on the internet, etc...

In Windows you don't have to bend the OS by arcane terminal commands, just install a program that does what you want. The kernel is not the OS, repeat after me: THE KERNEL IS NOT THE OS. Just look at Android.
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:40:31
All fair points, except there's a reason you can't make such direct comparisons: like you said, with a 90% market share there's a lot of incentive for developers to make programs and tools for just one OS and be done with it, now matter how cool a "unix based proprietary OS with almost as much GUI legacy as Windows".
@_date: 2015-12-16 13:23:21
You are right. It's because there are so few people like you that we have so few full nodes.
It's very typical of open-source programs to be like this, absolutely atrocious to a non-technical user. And it's very typical of open-source enthusiast to shun everything about user experience and just put all the burden on the user.
You want to run a bare-bones program? Go ahead and do it. Why do you want that to be the only option? Why can't I download a nice visually rich client for use or motivation? Why do I have to go to different 3rd party websites to check the status of my transaction?
I'm also to blame, as I could contribute to a nice interface, but I don't have the time. But I do run a full node to support the network, even though for actual wallet use I use Electrum.
@_date: 2014-10-17 10:57:23
All correct, hence the first line.


When people outside the geek world say Linux they mean a Linux distribution.


You're right, bad wording on my part. I meant to say made for consoles FROM the 80's.
In fact, I think the current limitations on terminals are from 70's, actually.

I've been composing music on Windows for 10 years now. Back then, you "needed" to use one specific trendy software and spend too much money on a glorified firewire DAC that enabled a special ASIO mode on a computer that cost 3x as much (a Mac). Or you could just use any soundcard at all in a Windows OS and just use a [generic ASIO driver]( with any number of different softwares. Hell, you could even use Linux with some kickass tracker software, you could compose on a Pentium 133 if you really wanted to.

TCP/IP is one of the layers of a communication protocol, heavily dependent on the lower layers (hardware, mostly). That analogy does not hold to scrutiny. IPv4 addresses, on the other hand, seem like a good example. Since every browser hides the IP, we are slowly migrating to IPv6 and you won't even notice it. What's your problem with that?
I've ridden all the layers of the TCP stack, I'm mid career electrotechnic engineer, that's why I am asking one last time for you to show me WHY I'm wrong. And if you don't get it, you're making a fool out of yourself, by being rude and not providing an explanation.

Sorry for not being clearer. I meant the disk encryption as an example, it is not a zero sum gain in terms of balance between security and convenience.

Modern hardware. But is it really relevant? Linux is just a kernel, and bloody good one at that, if not the best. But the distros make the OS.

The problem is a proportional power-wealth voting. Some rich ass Arab with the most cash will have like 1/10 of the voting power of the world, while us mere humans will have essentially negligible voting power, as 99,9 % of the voting power would lie with the very rich. We don't need a fairy tale democracy, we need a fair democracy and that just wouldn't be fair.

I am no security expert, although I know enough to be dangerous, but this is not a question of "how" but "when". Every OS has security issues, some are known, some are unknown.

The logic of starting early is to avoid those kind of blunders that make you look back and say: "shit, if only we made this tiny fix back then, we wouldn't have such a massive headache and deployment problems now". For exemples see: Y2K, Database password storing, IPv4, 802.11 encryptions, JavaScript (also known as hack script) and of course, HTTP.

I call bulshit on the convenience vs security. A well though of system will be just a tad inconvenient but really secure. Every time I boot my pc I must enter a long password do decrypt my partitions. It's 2 seconds at most and the data is pretty secure (save for a freeze-ram attack, which if you're in that kind of situation, no amount of encryption will help you).
You can't force people to learn so much and expect proper behavior in every one, you have to design the system in a way that secure behaviour is not-optional and is embedded in the workflow. Otherwise, even with all the education in the world, you're still only reaching about 10% of your users: we're human, we can't help it.

Only if all that noise is abstracted from the user. If the first time a user opens a wallet, he has to select his LN hub, then a fallback, then a SW, then wait 3 weeks for the DB to sync, then wait 1 week for his first transaction to reach it's destination, then fiddle about with tx fees, then continuously monitor the LN hub might it gone rogue or something....

It's true, because on mobile you just can't get away with throwing some grey widgets on the screen and just list dependencies. The interface has to work with touch and that forces at least some care, otherwise no-one uses/downloads an app.
Just had a look at them now, as I never used a Bitcoin wallet in my phone, only dogecoin. They do look nice, though what comes to my mind is that we'll need a standard for security, has each wallet has it's own way of doing security. I would never have a wallet that depends on a 3rd party server with a &gt;1 BTC, or one that requires me to side-channel a way to store my private keys.
Anyway, SPV wallets are the bastards of wallets, they are parasites in the network. It's either that or "indexing database" or "64 hours behind" or even "You can't shutdown your computer for another 5 minutes, the wallet is doing something something...".
@_date: 2016-01-04 12:04:09
