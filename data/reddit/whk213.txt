Get the nano s. Just make sure you are generating the 24 word key yourself and didnt come on a piece of paper already written down. A good way is once you recieve your nano s, setup as a new device but dont write down the 24 word key, set any pin unplug and replug, then get the pin wrong 3 times to factory reset. Once its reset again, setup as new device, NOW WRITE YOUR KEY DOWN, set pin download your crypto wallets, g2g. I love the nano s. I dont like the new one with bluetooth... seems sketchy. I dont want my crypto over bluetooth!
Edit: i personally like the nano s bcus its a hard wallet. You need to physically press buttons to ok a transaction, but more importantly, your private keys have never been on any device capable of connecting to the internet nor the keys generated by a device capable of being connected to the internet.

If your talking about US dollars being backed by gold, its not and hasnt been for decades now... our great president nixon took us off the gold standard during his presidency and made it illegal at the time for people to own gold. So basically your US dollars are just fancy fabric with the backing of the good ol U.S. of A. Our US dollar is backed by TRUMP of America. ‘Merica, FUCK YA!
