Roger from Coinbase here. 
1800Flowers announced in July are working to integrate it. They recently acquired another company (Harry &amp; David), so there's a lot of backend work going on integrating the systems. In the meantime, check out  They even feature bitcoin right on their homepage!

I head up merchant BD for Coinbase. Sorry, but this statement is just false. If you take a look at  and coinbase.com to see the prices, coinbase consistently offers better pricing to consumers at checkout.

Shouldn't be, can you try again? I just did and got the exact same price. They're both plugging into the same price api:

Dish added the functionality last summer. You have to be a Dish user to see the payment option though. source: I worked on the integration

We do. See examples at Overstock and Dell (link to tools  Its just in this case Gyft opted for the sign-in method to provide a different option for bitcoin users.

Can always use our multi-sig vault where you do control 2/3 keys.

You can test this using bitpay's rate:  and coinbase's:  to see that its not just because of this integration.. this is true in general

Only via the web portal for now. There's the issue of the changing bitcoin price that makes static paper bills difficult to resolve.

We leave it to the merchants to choose. In this case, since Gyft already had a standard checkout w/ Bitpay option, the Coinbase flow is just a supplement.

What I had meant is that if Gyft were to opt for a different integration, you would still see the same price difference. The type of integration is up to the merchant.
