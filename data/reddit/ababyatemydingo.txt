I know for a fact this is not true. How do you choose from a menu, or what movie to see, or which girl to date, which team to back, or which shirt to wear?
Some of these things have objective criteria like price, but that's not the major determinant.
We deal in opinion all the time, simple, subjective opinion.
In the OP, it could easily have been that they expected to make more money from bitcoin than Facebook, for example.

Oh dear. You are misreading my post quite badly. Nowhere did I refer to bitcoin people being homeogeneous. It should be clear that I am referring to those bitcoin people who DO match the criteria I listed.
Nowhere did I say these attributes are specific to bitcoin people, that's actually a comical misrepresentation of my post. I'll gloss over this point as it's really quite silly.


Yes, it is THOSE people I'm referring to, ie the smug guy I was replying to and his ilk.

Double spacing is madness and makes no sense except on a manual typewriter.
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:08:31
If I understand your point, it's silly. You could apply it to bitcoin versus fiat just as readily. You're saying bitcoin is special because of convention not intrinsic value. You're making my point for me.
There are 70 or more digital coins. Which one is special and why? How can that never change?
Edit: the barriers to a new language are much greater than adopting a new currency. I switch currencies all the time.
Also are you speaking of bitcoin as store of value or as a payment mechanism?

Incorrect. Or at least it can't be stated. 
Just because there are 2 possibilities does not mean they're equally likely.


@_date: 2014-01-20 20:28:00
This is what I wonder about. There's nothing intrinsic to bitcoin that prevents other digital coins. In fact there are over 70 apparently. Some may well be superior in some respects.
@_date: 2014-01-18 08:27:30
There's my huge reservation about bitcoin. Bitcoin is limited, but there's no limit on other coins just being created. There's no intrinsic reason why bitcoin must win. So, it's faith ultimately.

No shit. Well, it was math anyway. Joke, not so much.

@_date: 2014-11-23 08:24:10




Yes. But most people are not retailers. Bitcoin's growth will be driven by ordinary users, not by retailers.
And for retailers, it's nowhere near zero cost as people keep pointing out.
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:09:55
Who are 'they'? Why would 'they' come for me?

Or consider some strands of bitcoin fanboys to be ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:38:12
What's apples and what's oranges is debatable. We compare superficially unalike things all the time. It's perfectly valid, as long as we are clear what we're doing. 
Cocaine is not like measles, but we can compare death numbers, days of work lost, cost to the public etc etc.
@_date: 2014-10-28 07:11:05


this sums up everything that is wrong with bitcoin people: smug superiority, disdain, confirmation bias, shouting at reality, etc.
Plus, you utterly miss the point: this cook is exactly the people you need to convince for bitcoin to be a success. If he is tech savvy, listen to his criticisms. If he's not, listen to the barriers he sees and learn from them. This guy is EXACTLY who you should listen to. It's not about whether he is right, do you get that? Do you not understand how the world works?
But you won't listen. You just keep wondering why won't they all just think like me?! Can't they see how smart I am? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:44:20

Ah, this is not a beginner's step. You have to have a wallet already set up, right? I own bitcoin and I'm pretty techie and I've never done this myself.
It's not really fair to say it's that easy for a novice like your stepmother.
My point is that buying bitcoin is not actually easy, despite what people say.

I know. Football is not like a concert, but we can compare attendance numbers, earnings, etc.

@_date: 2016-01-26 17:48:16
Ok, what does 'understand' mean?? We do all use it, very few understand how it works, just like a computer or even a car. This is my exact point of course. TCP has become entirely invisible to the user, Bitcoin is the opposite. I don't give a shit about the experts, they're not the point. If you want bitcoin widely used, this means the general public and it means becoming as invisible as TCP. This is a pipe dream at the moment.
Of course, this prompts the question: do the experts really want this? They seem to revel in the obscurity.
@_date: 2016-03-12 15:31:05

I'm working on my third degree, and I'm talking highly competitive and technical topics. I'm a scientist and researcher. I have a ludicrous IQ. I worked in IT for many years. I've followed bitcoin for a couple of years. I've bought some. And I understand almost nothing about it in any detail.
I don't believe it's stupid at all to say it's too complicated.

No, 2-3% is ideal, not 0, as the rest of your post then explains. Small, predictable, steady inflation is the best scenario. People don't put off spending, they have certainty about the future, debts are steadily reduced. 0% is not ideal at all.

He was a terrorist in the same way as all the US school shootings are terrorism. This was basically a school shooting with no islamist connections.
Our use of 'terrorism' only to describe actors we don't agree with is very unhelpful here.

That prompts a question: what would be 'success' for Bitcoin? Is it a stable value so it can be used as a regular payment mechanism? Is it a steadily increasing value so it's a good investment? Is it a wildly fluctuating value so traders can make profits? Is it widespread acceptance which then kills the fun of feeling exclusive and happening?
Serious questions, I've been wondering.
