Ok i did some research and there is quite a bit happening thought i will update the community ...
1. Segwit implementation in may
2. Lightening network - fast and less fee transaction
3. Tumble bit - giving option to people for anonymous transaction
4. side chain to bring down congestion in BTC network - prominent being rootstock secured trx / smart contracts.
5. reduction in number of signature - can increase number of trx/ sec by 33% - project -Schnorr Signature. helps in scaling capacity.
6. Atomic swap - will alow ppl to exchange crypto with BTC with out use of 3rd party exchanges.

i jus have 2 full proof word for you.... and its easier said then done 
"Cost averaging"
put in 10$ - 20 - 30... what ever u can every sunday. dont look at the price or volatility...dont think it will fall tmrw and i will buy it then
Just do it like clock work...and you will always beat the market average.

Here is my analysis. . U tried to diversify was a great idea.. but ur analysis was next to zero.
Your biggest mistake was to invest your complete money at one go...
If you wanted to invest 150k USD it should have been invested in the market distributed not only on different coins but more importantly distributed over time span of 6 mnths.
I still think siacoin is one of the few coins which actually serves a purpose and will give you good return in future.  All the below mentioned coins are different and actually solve a purpose.
I am not a user of any coin...but I am a savy investor and invest and/or want to invest in following coins 
1. IOTA - internet of things (iot) will be very big in next 5 years...if iota can actually capture even 10% of iot business (as currency to exchange services in iot) it will do wonders. It's actually solving problems with its recent partnership.
2. NEO - etherium of China. . No special language to be learned by coders... (this is similar to lisk , eon and stratis ..but here comes the best part) it's actually partly supported by Chinese government... now china has its own Google ..n check out alexa for the traffic there...so m pretty sure china's own etherium too will do wonders.
3. XRP ripple - I know ppl will hate me to support a centralised coin...but as I said I am an investor not a user.. n I bet if bank of UK , Japan and rumour has it even FED are putting there resources and interest in it .. I would too. It's actually one coin that has a daily practical usage in real life.
4. Siacoin - I recently learned about it and while it's far from achieving what it wants...it's goal is worthy of our investment. . Also I compared it's cost with the cost of current cloud storage ..it's 80% cheaper. 
5. Golem - similar to my openion on siacoin..it's love what it wants to do..so worth a minor investment.
6. Monero - again a coin that is actually being used daily and solves a community purpose.. it can even be used in porn industry apart frm dark web ...which is legal and huuuuge ..dnt knw if monero proponent have thought about it.
7. Stratis - sleeping giant..I yet have to investigate more about it... I knw it's similar to etherium and neo....but I also knw it's in partnership with Microsoft. . I minor push or even a mention of it by Bill gates can send it soaring (and this is even if it can do shit...which I knw is not the case..I think in future big companies will simply adopt successful coins and blockchains rather than making there won ones. Just like JPMC is using ether ) 
8. BTC ..yes it's slow ..yes there are coins coming to overcome all its shortcoming ...but it's mother of all coins...it will always remain as  coin to keep value even if it doesn't have practical use of future. 
Biggest plus is it will have demand coz its a currency to trade in any curency unless ether or some other takes its place...biggest practicle example.. any one in Asia , Africa nd many more places can only buy BTC ..they then transfer it to exchanges like polo Nd bitfinex and trade in altcoins and then again convert to BTC to cash in Fiat.
Here is my 2 cents .. I yet have to study many many coins.. but Btc , iota and neo  are my best bet and constitute my major portfolio ..more I learn about them more I am convinced about there future.

yes it is! I am a working professional for past 11 years and am qualified to understand both technical aspect an financial potentials of crypto.for past several years i followed major discipline to maintain following asset allocation % ( i am a little aggressive investor)
70% equity , 10% gold 15% cash and 5 % debt
i gun for CAGR (Cumulative average growth rate of 15%)
around 45 days back when i started studying Crypto i changed my outlook reduced 5% gold and put it to Crypto... as i entered further through this worm hole... i am starting to get more and more convinced that 
1-  its ANTI Equity (regulated stock market) 
2 - Risk to reward is massively in favour of reward 
considering its untapped potential and trasperency and most importantly technology
CAGR expected here is more than 30% which is masssssssive 
i will be increasing my asset allocation in favour of Crypto
Sooner the Investment guru take notice of crypto ...better it will be for them and there clients. coz its gona be massive.

thanks for letting us know.. :)

Ofcourse buddy ... but you need to understand exchanges dont allow Fiat INR to get converted in other Currency
But offcourse we all use  other Exchanges to buy Altcoins by using our BTC.
But buying BTC using INR is the problem
