At some point each holder will feel a “wealth effect .”
People buy things they want or need. Every year a new iPhone comes out packed with more features for relatively the same price ( deflationary) and yet people line up around the block to buy them.

One of the precursors to the collapse of a fiat system is an exponential increase in political corruption. Some of it is cognitive and some act on intuition. It is pretty clear we are approaching the death throes of fiat.
Of the nearly 200 nation states in the world many are in dire financial straits and swimming in debt. It seems very likely at some point the ruling political elite will quietly amass crypto holdings (personal and governmental). They will indeed be jumping ship but right into lifeboats.
I am perfectly fine with seeing the corrupt ruling class getting unimaginable golden parachutes if it is in exchange for their own extinction. 
This will happen.

Rest assured governments will try to ban it the minute they figure out how to ban math.

People wait in line for days for the newest iPhone when they know a better one will come out in one year.

People buy the new iPhones when they come out knowing they will be replaced with a better model the next year. Actually all consumer electronics are deflationary but people continue to make buying decisions based on both needs and wants.

Do they plan on banning algebra?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:32:05
The only way to "ban" it is to ban algebra. Good luck with that.

New iPhones come out every year at roughly the same price but with added features and capabilities and yet people line up to buy the new one every year. People buy things they want when they want.

Throughout 6000 years of recorded history the average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years. Nixon severed the final link to gold in 1971. Tick tock. 
The difference this time is we are on a worldwide fiat system so the magnitude of this inevitability will bring with it incredible chaos but also liberation. It will happen more rapidly than most people realize. 
Reminds me of when you ask a man how he went bankrupt and he replies "Slowly at first, then all at once."

Honestly asking....couldn't they just move it to Monero and bounce it around for a bit and then back to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:15:12
Exactly. Look at smartphones. They are a deflationary product even though the price may remain relatively stable year to year they new models add features and capabilities yet that doesn't stop people from lining up to purchase the newest iPhone even though they know a better model will come out the next year. Wants and needs continue.
