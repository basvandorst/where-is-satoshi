I'm not the reason those people would be selling their position.  
If anything, it's on them for having weak hands/falling for FUD.  
I am a BTC hodler that is open to buying more as I save a bit from every paycheck.  
Is it wrong to want a better deal? By your logic, why don't hodlers just put in market buy orders at $30k USD right now? That will make every other hodler richer, right..?

In your theoretical terms, quantum computing will break the banks' systems, valuable/sensitive information's databases(government intelligence agencies), personal passwords, etc too.  
BTC, having the largest market cap of the cryptos, is still only a fraction of the market cap of gold.  
And even gold is only a fraction when compared to the global economy.  
So, if BTC had to worry, the entire world should probably be more worried.  
Thankfully, cryptos have the option of being upgraded to be quantum resistant.  
And even so, the rest of the world, especially those calling cryptos bubbles etc, will have to worry first **and address the issue before cryptos will _need_ to**.

It may be because its the only option normal people have to invest into BTC with their money locked away in IRAs/retirement funds etc. Also, most of them do not understand and do not want to take the risks of personally managing the private key, buying it through an exchange, etc so it may also be more convenient for them.

This is actually great news. It shows that people are taking crypto-storage security seriously and _learning the system_.

You can see buy and sell volume on an exchange.

Try using a BTC mining profit calculator to see an estimate.  
It is practically guaranteed you will lose money with mining BTC on a GPU(and especially a _single_ GPU), unless your electricity bill is free.  
And if your electricity is somehow free, it is probably illegal to use that energy to power your mining rig.

Bcash is the very ponzi scheme that the mainstreamers have been screaming bloody mary at, and are afraid of.  
I feel bad for those that want to get Bitcoin but got Bcash instead.

NY is among the strictest states in terms of regulation. Crypto Exchanges probably need to apply for licenses &amp; agree to follow the regulations in order to be granted access to do business in NY.

Please do your research.  
You _can_ withdraw coins from Robinhood, which means that you **are** basically buying the coin.
