fake node counts and hope miners fall for it lol. UASF is a joke

he can that today... this doesn't magically begin happening just because BU is enabled
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:25:19
you realize it is easy to sybil node counts right? everything you said means nothing

BU gets enabled with &gt;=75% hashrate. the original chain would take several weeks for a difficulty adjustment and would have no security because it is the dead coin. good luck finding the dead coin on any exchange to exchange for bitcoin

likes BU, what you are describing is currently

UASF is nodes showing support for X but that means nothing when it costs nothing to spin up a bunch of nodes showing support for X. 1 node != 1 user in the network

even when BU have &gt;=75% of the network? you would be buying the coin on the dead chain lol

there is a reason why the consensus code in bitcoin nodes follow the longest chain... security is the most important quality of bitcoin and the minority chain will be left with a large difficulty retarget which will basically kill it

What they might try when financial institutions are able to short BTC en masse is more of a concern to me than government regulation.  Markets opening up to crypto has its own drawbacks and there's no way governments aren't planning devious schemes to take us down.  
I'm not a bear, but realistically they're going to have various tricks up their sleeves.

it is easier to 51% the number of coins that are currently being staked than 51% proof of work. you don't need a large amount of coins in circulation, only enough to take over the staking pool

the failure of one proof of work system does not mean all proof of work systems have failed. proof of stake is the hyper opposite of decentralization and the ideals satoshi had envisioned with 1 cpu 1 vote etc. sha256 has merely turned out to be a terrible proof of work when decentralization is desired

every transaction in monero is private by default. an optional sidechain on bitcoin is just that... an option. bitcoin has more work to do to than an optional sidechain to have fungibility
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:47:45
optimizations in miners are expected in this competitive industry. how is more hashrate securing the network damaging to bitcoin? the sky is not falling buddy

if the 21 million cap was changed it wouldn't be acknowledged as bitcoin, ever heard of a social contract?
