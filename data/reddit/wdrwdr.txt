Those who were awake when Gox went offline with a white page and who checked the HTML would have seen the html tags looking like: &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
They went back sometimes after 3:00 am EST and intentionally added that code. It's not a leak or an error, it was deliberate - for what purpose I am not sure.

When the site went offline between the hours of 11:00 pm February 24th EST and 2:00 am EST February 25th the html code was something like:
&lt;html&gt;&lt;doctype code here, I can't recall what it was&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
It had NOTHING with regards to an acquisition. That someone changed the code, and chose to use "acq" leaving people in doubt as to what it means (it doesn't actually say acquisition), is just another head game that fat piece of shit Karpeles is playing with you. Nobody would leave that code in there nor was it there to begin with. Just more Gox lies.

BTC-E has always been a shady site. In order to deposit money you have to use one of their shady exchange services like Payeer or Perfect Money (Russian ripoff site). Support is non existent. Payeer is the worst - their website is a piece of shit. Try to make a deposit with credit card using Internet Explorer and right after you enter your card it gives an error message box and asks "Retry/Abort". Retry will result in double charging the card, abort will leave your card charged once. Then you check your e-mail and Payeer has already billed the card despite your funds not going through to BTC-E. I had to literally cancel 6 of these transactions in a row after trying to deposit my money into BTC-E via Payeer. In the end Payeer suspended my account due to my bank finally saying, "Something fishy is going on here" and froze the card until I could verify it was me who was using it.

He has every right to be pissed off. If someone took $300 from your wallet and burned it, wouldn't you be irate? BTC-E is run by unknowns, and could go down at any day leaving depositers without any recourse. At least with American exchanges you know you'd have some recourse if they closed up overnight.
