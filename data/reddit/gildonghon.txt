I live in korea. As you know, Korea has very expensive prices of cripto-currencies than world-standard price about 20~25%. 
I dont know how long these prices will last, But I hope that I can try to get as much money as possible. 
Thank you for any help or idea in advance.

Thank you for answer..
I don't want any problems. 
Anyway, your explantion is...
1. I can create bank account in europen country even though I am a foreigner. ( to fund my deposit, only international transfer possible? ATM machine or any other mothod impossible?)
And that the money limit for international transfer is 10,000 euro.(But how about the amount of my money added by the other method like ATM machin etc, is it problem?)
2. If I have a bank account, I can register my bank account in europen exchange like Bitstamp, Bitrush etc. 
3. I buy the cryptocurrencies and then transfer my wallet in my country. 
Am I understood?
I have 2 question on your answer..
First, to fund my deposit, only international transfer possible? ATM machine or any other mothod impossible?
Second, But how about the amount of my money added to my deposit by the other method like ATM machine etc, is it problem?
Thank You kind explanations
