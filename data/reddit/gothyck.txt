But you then have to substract the 4% you would have gained either way from the 5%. And that 1% may very well not be worth the risk of investing when you can just get 4% without any risk of losing your money. Sure, some investment is just so profitable that it will occur even when you got deflation, but there's no question that it will heavily diminish investment overall. Because it's profit without risk.


We are talking business investments, not personal spending. Most investments are tax free: You are not paying taxes on money you give to the bank for interest, you're not paying taxes for buying fonds and the sort. So your *proof* is irrelevant.

You've said exactly nothing that has to be explained. You said it's BS, they pointed out prevailing academic opinion and real life experience disagree with you.
