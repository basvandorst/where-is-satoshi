No, you can't - but what you can do is buy now on CoinBase (or other exchanges) and they will issue you the BitCoin at the market price.  It will hit your account in ~10 days once the funds clear.
I suggest CoinBase because it owns GDAX and transfers between GDAX and CoinBase are free.

First thing, are you in the US?  Because tax law varies so without telling us this, any advice may be irrelevant.
Assuming you are in the US, the IRS is being fairly clear on how they treat crypto.  It's a capital asset, subject to capital gains tax, realized on a "First In, First Out" (FIFO) basis. 
What does this mean?
Scenario 1: You buy crypto, it's now grown over $14,000 but you haven't traded it at all.  You just hodl the same coins all year.  There is not yet a taxable event.
Scenario 2: You buy crypto.  You sell some, you buy some, you sell, you buy, you sell, you buy. You end the year $14,000 up.  Each of those sells is a taxable event - even if you leave the money on the exchange.  
Assuming that you were buying and selling throughout the year, each of those sales is treated like earned income (so added to your Taxable Income i.e. you made $50K a year, you now made $64K this year - you're taxed like that).
Most importantly, when you sell, FIFO means that you are selling the FIRST coins you bought, not the last ones and the gains (or loss) calculated on that.
If you held the coins for more than a year, then you are "Long Term Capital Gains" and taxed at a flat rate (15% or  20% depending on your income).
I am not your tax accountant, but I do believe this is reasonable understanding of how the IRS will treat a US citizen.

My understanding, just based on what I've read, is that a crypto for crypto is treated like crypto-usd-crypto.  So if you held ETH and sold it for BTC, you'd report any gain/loss on the ETH / USD value at the time of the trade and your acquisition value for the BTC would be that USD amount.
There's some information floating around that the IRS are clarifying this to make sure this is clear (I don't believe it's really different from what they've done in the past, but it is being clarified for Crypto).

That's the business model. Play with their money for a fee, or wait until you get your own money onto the exchange and play for a much lesser fee.
