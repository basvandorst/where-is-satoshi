It's a drop in the bucket for him. He invented and sold the gambling game Satoshi Dice for over 100,000 BTC. I think he'll be fine.

Well, there's supposed to be a record of every transaction whenever the data jumps from one wallet to the next, but it would be nearly impossible to figure out who ends up with it until they show up at a bank to withdraw funds, right?
Then again, this shit is above my head, the fact that they were dealing with that much money and couldn't get to the bottom of this "tansfer malleability" for 3 years is unbelievable. They are either the most incompetent people in finance, or the most brilliant thieves.
I think Karpeles may end up dead in a couple of years (if not months), so it has to be incompetence. No one would publicly steal that much money from a group that surely houses a few people capable of violence.
That guy better disappear for his own safety, I just don't see things going well for him, then again maybe I'm too paranoid. If I were him, I'd disappear as fast as possible. Fuck the lawsuits, fuck the investigations, just become a ghost.

Ain't that the truth.

One can hope. My problem is that I bought in at $625 and again at $595. Don't have the mining rig(s) necessary and thought I'd get into crptos by starting with BTC. I just don't like seeing my money evaporate, lol, but who does?
BTC will be here to stay for a while, it's just catching on. I'd just like to hit the floor sooner than later.

I'm not disagreeing that the implosion of Gox wasn't necessary, but to display such callousness in light of the fact that a lot of people are taking a serious bath on this is ridiculous.
You have no fucking idea if the bottom is in sight, are you a goddamn clairvoyant. For all you know this was a huge bubble and the recent rally was a dead cat bounce.
Maybe I'm too wrapped up in losing money over BTC tanking, but Jesus, there's a difference between dispensing actual advice and being a dick. I think you were treading into the latter field.
I don't think Bitcoin is dead, but it'll be in the ICU for a while. Whatever, I'm holding regardless.

The world of cryptocurrency is bizarre. I literally JUST joined after Valentine's day. I was originally reading about Doge, thought it was hilarious, bought 5K worth of BTC to change into Doge, realized there was way too much of it in circulation, Gox then implodes, BTC dips, then climbs back up higher than I bought it for, lose my level 3 verification due to VOS severing ties with the US, and now this Satoshi business.
This month is out of control. Is it always this exciting, or did I just join at the right time?
edit: spelling

If anyone should be nervous, it's Karpeles. I imagine a  lot of people are hemorrhaging a decent amount of money right about now. And who knows when the end will be in sight. If he's smart he'll watch his back and perhaps hire a bodyguard or two.
To delay patching a known security flaw for a few years and then crashing MtGox into a wall while simultaneously evaporating tens of millions of dollars isn't something that is easily forgotten.

The amount of data to pour over would be MASSIVE, it was a known issue for three years! Who knows how many tickets were like that? If they were smart they used unverified accounts, verified accounts would be easier to track, then again, having never traded there, I don't know what the limits were for unverified users. Either way, I'm sure more than a few people knew and were working the system for years.
Even if they could trace a particular coin, couldn't much of that activity be masked by taking said coins and distributing them on other exchanges, or even selling physical paper wallets and passing them to other unsuspecting users with cash transactions?
But yes, this is obviously far beyond the scope of Gox uncovering/fixing. It's a huge clusterfuck however you look at it.
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:21:52
I'm pretty sure the MtGox fiasco is going to cost the BTC community heavily.

Damn, it's been ages since I've watched some Futurama, I need to change that.

Ah, I wasn't aware. Thanks for the info. Man, what an investment. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:38:33
Thanks for the info, I wasn't trying to buy, just export to my local wallet. I'll log out and try again. Perhaps my browser is acting up.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:32:37
So you can send and request? I even right-click and "open in a new tab", just opens the same wallet page I'm already on.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:00:05
I personally got a kick out of reading this as well.




I got to the party late and bought in at $625 and $595... not feeling particularly rockstar-ish. I can wait out the fallout, but this past week has been an interesting introduction to cryptos to say the least.
edit: I f'ed up the formatting/symbols
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:47:12
Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. If only I had listened to my inner nerd back then. Either way cryptocurrencies have hooked me now and whether or not bitcoin dies, it's the way of the future, and therefore exciting all the same, win or lose. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:14:29
I didn't lose anything in the Gox implosion, other than the value of coins I had bought elsewhere. However, your negativity about a proposed course brings absolutely nothing to the table. If you wanna go cry in a corner while the adults attempt to fashion some kind of response, no matter if the chance of adoption is low, be my guest.

Oh yeah, and then there was that time that the first person literally banned from the internet (for money laundering) was talking to Vorhees about the hackjob in the WSJ.
Reddit, you crazy.

I think the most difficult thing will be juggling the potential legal ramifications of all this, but if a significant number of those who were holding large amounts of fiat/coins get wind of this and support it, there may be a chance of some lives being able to be saved from this debacle. It may be a longshot, but stranger things have happened.
Wanting to burn MtGox to the ground is understandable, but it makes sense to salvage what can be salvaged, no matter how complicated it may be, it could be a great thing for BTC from a PR perspective as well ans helping make as many people whole as possible.

Gah! I had even searched my history and mistakenly overlooked their little bitcoin logo with the red and green arrows thinking it was for another site I had previously visited.
In short: Thanks, and I hope you're in better shape than I am, lol. I just recently got into this cryptocurrency gig despite knowing about it for years, it would appear this is an exciting time to say the least.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:34:58
Fuck you. You're an ass. Only a real piece of shit would engage in such schadenfreude at a time like this. You're a miserable piece of human debris for displaying such a lack of empathy.
tl;dr - Go fuck yourself.

Scariest fuckin' drug ever. It's unreal that people become mindless slaves when dosed. There is nothing good about that drug at all, completely sinister to the core.

Apparently they weren't holding as many as they thought, a figure of 700,000+ stolen BTC was floated, but I can't attest to the accuracy. Either way, a fuckton of money vanished. The next few weeks are going to be a little rough to say the least.

Arbitrage. He was selling BTC for a higher amount on Gox as he could buy them for cheaper prices on other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:31:44
This is good for Bitcoin.

It's an "old" joke. 
I've only been in the crypto-world for about 4 years now, but if you spend enough time here you'll eventually see someone say that when shit hits the fan. Anytime there's a correction, or an event that rattles the market, someone always chimes in that whatever is happening is actually for the better... in the long run. 
Funnily enough, Bitcoin has shown its resilience and come back each time, but there's always the worry that things could go further south.
Looking at your post history it would seem you're kind of new to the game. The only advice I have is to buy only what you can afford to lose. The blockchain itself was an amazing innovation, and it's definitely here to stay, but there's the chance that bitcoin itself may not be around in 5 or 10 years. We're still early in this game to be honest. 
Good luck!
