I'm just a little bit skeptical about coloured coins / counterparty just based on the size of the market that would be able to trade on it. Are there any good examples so far of things that have launched like this ?
@_date: 2014-10-12 18:07:33
All good points.. Let me try and address them...
Yes Wifi is hyperlocal and no good at all for roaming.. so it would be "static" visitors that would benefit the most (or,  in another use case, as the bitcoin protocol and ports are always open - used for a bitcoin transaction where the buyer is out of signal, has funds on a none phone type device or just has poor signal etc etc). Re: ATMs.. I'm already talking to a few providers of bitcoin atms who would be happy to have these devices where the atms are as well.
Yes the opt-out is in the plan.. I'd be publishing to openstreetmap so all the people who suck the data out of that will get these "by default" (I did try running my own mapping service but the maintenance was just too much trouble). 
Rasp Pi chaps - if it sells a fair few units then of course I'll be in touch.. And yes I'll be doing the hackathons etc etc as well to try and flog them, raise awareness etc etc...
No the rasp pi isn't needed, but it's the cheapest smallest device that can be used for rapid prototyping so it ticks all the boxes right now. The holy grail would be a (permitted) app on either the iphone or android store that sells on your 3g/4g access automatically - omitting the device altogether - but that has a lot of work both technically and legally to overcome.
Reselling internet is not necessarily illegal .. but it may break your T&amp;Cs of your provider. I'll be ensuring people are aware of this.
Please sign up on the email list.. that's where I'll be doing most of the updates as I don't like to spam the reddits ...

I am liking this idea... I could issue bitcoinwifi access coins (ie "access for life") to get the thing off the ground as well as bitcoinwifi premium partner / site coins - so that they can be on the whitelist to start with ...

There are two ways to look at competition. If it doesn't exist then take a long look into why (perhaps it did and they failed) perhaps the market isn't big enough no matter how good your product is?   If it does exist then great,  you've proved the market exists... Now you just have to build a better product for just one slice of that market.

@_date: 2014-02-23 20:42:09
I agree with the point that the funds have been misused by nothing being done with them; I hate the argument "hey look I've managed to increase the value of the funds by not spending them as USD/BTC has gone up" as that's basically the same as "I put it all on red in the casino and therefore the value has gone up". I would argue that USD/BTC would be worth *more* if the funds had gone back into circulation to forum development, as part of the whole economy / liquidity cycle essential for bitcoin growth..
Also... referring to another post about the IRS ... if there really is approx 5M USD of "stuff" somewhere, you can guarantee that there will be a subsection of financial code that insists that there is a formation of a body (whether that be profit / non-profit etc etc) which is required to manage that fund. At that point, it would be interesting to see exactly how the org is structured as I suspect that "how it appears to run" and "how it is actually run" are two different things. Putting it down in writing would make these things transparent.
It's unfortunate that the bitcoin world has dozens of examples of well intentioned projects going to shit and, let's be honest, the only reason bitcointalk still exists is that it's now the ebay of the bitcoin world ... I'm hoping though, eventually, just like alta vista and google or betamax and VHS, natural selection will choose a better alternative.

Just to add ... what it appears that most people in believe is that companies will *never* change their working practices but just sink when a new way of doing business appears. This is not that case and is far from the truth esp. when dealing with internet savvy corporations.
You can bet your ass that the second it looks as if bitcoin is a true contender in the international payments market, then Western Union will just move over to using it, admittedly taking a hit, but using their market share to dominate again. To the uneducated or unaware, they would happily use a "trusted" name like WU in order to guarantee the transfer. This is known as "good will" in company evaluation.
Secondly, ebay / paypal are not stupid. They would love to accept bitcoin and then they could probably sack 90% of their fraud department - think of those savings !! Plus adding all the "unbanked" to their potential customer list. I would not be surprised if they have high level plans in place already about what hurdles they would have to overcome to incorporate bitcoin in their payment flow (technical, legal etc etc).

Phase one .. the customers are individuals.. This should help us get the infrastructure / update / cloud management (optional) mechanisms sorted without too much trouble. Then.. potentially moving onto the larger volume customers.
The transaction is sent as bitcoin transactions are always allowed through (along with access to selected partner sites which is editable by the owner and also via our updating mechanism). I know that its now easy to spoof traffic that may look like bitcoin transactions but is really someone tunnelling http ... but let's be honest... they probably deserve free wifi anyway !! (oh and there will be bounty bug hunts as well.. eventually).
Edit: re: known servers.. We are considering running a full node on the device but SD cards don't take too well to the nature of the bitcoind file writing - esp. from the genesis...
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:13:15

Hi there.. Yes there are already a number of people willing to pay for it .. the question is how best to get something to them ( I demonstrated at the recent inside bitcoins conference to gain feedback and could have sold at least 20+ units ).  Also.. there was a reporter there who did a write up on the unit and .. even though it isn't completely accurate ... he did some up the feelings of someone who isn't 100% connected - 
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:22:59
Ok.. 
so I have just issued my first token on  ... it's the "BTCWIFINETLIFE" token - I've created 100 but there are only 20 for sale at the moment which will give the owner lifetime access to the bitcoin wifi network*. This is 100% refundable until the project reaches 1000 globally deployed access points. You are free to sell on to anybody else the token at any time for any price you wish (before or after that target is met).
Now how I do the technology to actually verify you have the coin will be a very interesting experiment but I'll do something basic to get people online to start with.
I'm setting the price at 0.2 btc which I think is a reasonable amount to see if there is real interest.
*Acceptable usage policy will apply.

Thanks. Believe me, flashing existing firmware on open wrt routers and other such directions are in the pipeline to investigate. In fact, we have a chap we are talking to at the moment who claims he is able to get us in front of the decision makers at router manufacturers (but let's see if that happens...) .. 
Also... wrt tor etc, that is also in the pipeline. There are a number of routes to go that way as well.. For example using tor as a default but "upgrading" to a vpn partner company for a small additional fee which would also enable the client to geo-locate to wherever they want to appear from. But all these bits are version 1.0+ as opposed to the releasable consumer MVP which is the priority right now.

Biometric scanners for a know individual authenticate, ie compare a known good vector (what you trained it with to start with) with a request.  What op is asking about is identification,  which is a completely different problem. Its like asking "is this shape a square" vs "what shape is this".

There is no way to determine the password or the length of the password*. It is used to create the seed that generates the stream of addresses. That's why you can use the same trezor with different passwords for completely different "accounts". It doesn't unlock or decrypt anything. It's used for the address generation. (*Unless by brute force as mentioned)

seriously .. this ... if you can only afford to take 200 dollars out of your wallet and have fun burning it then please dont put it into bitcoin. Put in just 100 or 50 or whatever you *can afford to lose*.
bitcoins *could* go down to zero, the exchange you traded on *might* get hacked, the wallet you save them on *might* get deleted or the harddrive fail. Who knows ? Maybe you'll forget your wallet password. These things happen far more often than you'd think.
Just the other day, I tried to boot up my tablet. It only had less thatn 1 bitcoin on it (if that) and it didn't boot. And then I thought. What if ... What if... this had *all* of them on and the flash had failed ? It **does** happen and I would hate for you to be the next "my harddrive has crashed what do I do" poster ...

I like the idea of wallet and chain separation. Ideally one would have the ability to trust a chain provider - whether that be a service running as you, or as a central user on one computer, or one computer in a small network etc etc (ie suitable for small home or office etc) or even using the same kind of certificate chains that browsers use (ie trust chains that are authenticated, signed by any of these certificates etc). I'm not saying this should be centralized, but just have the ability to be accessed within a small scale environment.

Hey I was sooo glad when I saw it was written in python. I was looking for some market scraping code so I could integrate it into this puppy :  - (it doesn't have a real home just yet). The  idea is that you start from "anywhere" (currency, bank account whatever), tell it what you "want" (which is mainly bitcoins) and it will figure out the best "route" for you (ie the one that incurs minimal loss). Although it looks static at the moment, I'm going to be replacing all the cost functions with live (and cached) calls to exchanges etc etc. Great stuff !

Irony. Working in banking, you will be fully aware of  AML / KYC legislature. Secondly, as a "risk analyst" you should be aware of statistics and therefore false positives and false negatives, and the effect of each of those on a financial body. Don't allow someone to trade as they came up as false positive? The consequence is a bit of bad feeling ("why me?") and a lost customer. Allow someone to trade who shouldn't have (ie "false negative") and when the SEC / FSA or whatever body investigates money laundering comes knocking on your door and you are in for a shit storm. The "close this down this minute, massive fines and send people to jail " type of shit storm. 
You never see these to the existing banks as ... well basically they've been playing golf with each other for years now (so to speak). New places though that are set to chip away at existing businesses though are a prime target (esp. as someone in an existing domestic bank will probably complain about them).
Do you really think that someone at coinbase is going to exert their time and effort into potentially defrauding you of 5 btc x 2 $ !?!?!!? Really ?? And exactly how does following their AML / KYC stuff amount to "fraud" ??
Ok. Calm down time for me now. I'm sorry that they didn't trade with you, but just give them a few months to get things in shape, keep in touch with them. The thing is that a real fraudster cannot afford to keep too much paper trail between the real him and his "alter ego". They'd rather just try and trade and then run if it works or doesn't work. Genuine customers will be keen to get a working relationship going even if it does mean jumping over a few hoops.
For what it's worth : I'm not related in anyway to coinbase - I don't even have an account with them as I'm not in the US, but I do work in banking and know how much of a necessary bind that AML KYC is.

Not only that, but you also need to factor in the chance of the "most profitable leg" failing - as it will do from time to time (this is due to all the other arbitragers trying to do exactly the same as you). It's just another thing that eats into the meagre profits. I'm not trying to put you off, but if you consider a "great" arbitrage opportunity of 5%, and there are 2% fees on both exchanges, and a 0.8% chance of failing, then you aren't going to be making as much money as you expect to. There is still money to be made - believe me - check out "arby.pl" when you have some time.

What's your primary language skillset? I ask as I am python / java but have put together this site here  :  and the goal is to integrate it into every single form of bitcoin exchange I can as to give the best live prices for "X" into bitcoin possible (also considering location and time). I don't mind going 50/50 with the right person either. Also, the data is now user editable (sort of) so I plan to reward people who find better ways of getting bitcoins with tips (ie if the community agree, then the originator of that method gets a kickback, incentivizing people to make it better). Monetization would be through the google methodology - ie make the search mechanism technically correct, but allow people to put sponsorship on certain routes (great for those new mtgox wannabes etc etc). 
My next stage is to offer an html widget to any site to improve traffic, after putting API calls to all the known exchanges that is.

Not really... as the difficulty will just keep climbing higher and higher until the miners with low hash rates start dropping out (as their electricity costs will greatly exceed their expected value they would get out of mining blocks and it would be financially efficient for them just to purchase bitcoins with them money they would have spent on the electric... unless they are doing it for kicks). 
Even with massive increases in "miner technology" the difficulty will keep the network stabilized .. eventually...

Not really... Only if it wants to "know" it's balance. If you think about it - the merchant can easily identify that you have enough (by looking up the public key balance in the blockchain), all you are doing is saying "transfer xxxx from this key to yyyy" - it's actually in the merchants interest to know that the transaction is valid due to that amount being under the available balance.

Do not buy a brand new mining rig with brand new GPUs. Your only chance right now (and you still can make some $$$$) is to buy 2nd hard GPUs (so you don't lose out on the resale value too much in 6 months time) and then mine litecoin.
Sorry but I had to use that word (litecoin) here - visit this page   and put in your scrypt rate as approx 1000 less than your sha256 rate ( ie the same number in each box). You'll see that litecoin at the moment is generally a better income provider than bitcoin. Don't worry though - you don't have to keep litecoins, you can trade them in a number of places for bitcoins quickly + easily.

Grrr. "Bitcoin can help strengthen the local economy by avoiding pesky taxes" ... Bitcoin was not designed to help you avoid paying taxes. It may help make that easier (ie hiding funds, transfers etc etc) but for society to function... you gotta have taxes !! Whether you agree with them or not, that's not the issue. If you don't like paying tax, you have two choices - take that up with your government - or move to a place that has lower taxation. Ok the third option is become one of the 1% and just all of your net worth in various tax free vehicles - but that's not available to 99% of us.
Bitcoin just avoids the blatant inflationary runaway pandemic in our economy based on the governments being allowed to just print out more cash.

Firsty, I am enjoying this philosophical argument.
What if the guards don't decide their tax .. but the villagers do in a "free market" type fashion. ie they decide that x% of their "income" goes towards paying guards and then unemployed villagers can become guards instead of whatever they were doing - instead of the guards deciding what their income will be. What if this wild animal isn't just destroying livestock but also killing the occasional child ? If there are too many guards, the villagers just decide to pay less tax until no-one wants to be a guard anymore (and vice versa).
I agree with you that what we have now is broken (limos and all) - but I don't agree that all tax is theft / extortion etc etc (but maybe I am just brainwashed).

nah you can get the bigger one that has 2 power supplies (and they are huuuge), one is 75w and the other is 150w (or 2 x 75w).  They do power a single pci-e power graphics card but I don't think they would work with the ones that require 2 power leads.
*However* ... the one I have has trouble identifying and using ATI cards as my internal GPU is an ATI as well.. It works great (for graphics) with nvidia but is a but fussy with ati. It is also plug and play - which is a bit weird (and also I don't quite trust it either) but they do work pretty much as well as you would expect. I have one on my desk here that I use to use every day (not so much now) and they are pretty good docking stations, especially as they have a few usb outs as well.
It also made a few senior people in my company jealous as their docking stations only support 2 external monitors and then you can't use the laptop monitor... where as this puppy you can do as many as the graphics card will power + your laptop screen.

Unless you already have a fairly decent GPU then do NOT buy a new one. Your best option - if you really want to get mining - is to pick up a second hand one from ebay / craigslist (after checking the estimated mining rate) and then reselling it in a few months. 
Even then, it will be questionable if you will be net positive after electricity costs **AT THE CURRENT BTC/USD** rate. Many miners will tell you not even to bother, but if you expect BTC/USD to still rise dramatically then it is still financially efficient to mine using GPUs (this is a fact that most miners will not tell you). However, you would be more economically better off just buying bitcoins, but then you leave yourself open to exposure to a complete collapse.
tl;dr. Don't buy a new GPU for mining. Buy a second hand one that has a reasonable hash rate and then look at reselling it in a few months OR just buy bitcoins from the market.

I have just started mining LTC instead of BTC. Why? As I am mining twice as much as I would do with BTC, I then go to btc-e a few times a day, sell into BTC. Job done. For me (and probably most other GPU miners), it makes sense to do this.
Saying "we should just focus on this crypto-currency" actually adds risk. Obviously BTC is the forerunner, but there is no harm at all in examining alternate crypto-currencies as it keeps the ecosystem healthy and I believe they will actually either stand together or if one should fall due to whatever issue - they may help prop each other up.  
Let the market and the wisdom of crowds decide what works.

However.. I am going to give you a bit of advice here which I hope you can apply to this and a number of similar scenarios - not just financially related. 
When things go wrong like this always ask yourself the question "Ok - so what could I have done at what step to prevent this happening or minimizing the damage ?". 
I know there are dozens of answers to this and I'm not going to patronize you with them ... but get yourself into the mindset that when things go wrong .. at the very least you need to learn from them. 
So you are out 1200 bucks at the moment.. and that stings. Just for a minute consider the number of people [Madoff]( screwed over ... entire life pensions gone. Ok .. some of them were fat cats anyway but some people lost their entire savings.
Trust No One. And if you have to trust someone, diversify - ie don't keep all your funds in one place.

The plan would be that I would have it delivered to me and then we would agree where it would remain hosted. Pref. UK but I am open to any suggestions.

@_date: 2013-02-14 01:59:35
The legislation thing is the bit that scares me the most. "BUT YOU CANT OUTLAW MATHS" is what I hear people say. No you can't. But you can outlaw anybody connecting to an unauthorised financial network (just mix up bitcoins with the typical "horsemen of the apocalypse" ie CP, terrorism, money laundering, drugs etc etc and you'll get public opinion on the govts side in no time). All they would have to do is outlaw any FX between a govt currency and a non-approved one (amazon, facebook, itunes can be a nominal fee to be put on the approved list) and then bam ... no more crypto currency for you. OK so you might be able to cash out in a 3rd world country ... but for what price?

I'm hoping to sell the entire thing at pretty much the sum of the costs and I will recoup my time via either the markup between being able to buy a number of rasppis in bulk and the retail price and/or value added services (cloud manangement) etc, a pretty box (perhaps).

Hi to the first joiner btw!
@_date: 2013-02-03 10:18:28
Thanks for that. I thought dwolla -&gt; bitinstant is 4% but I will update that shortly.
Edit: Ooops. I understand now. I just looked at the bitinstant site and it is 4%.. I've now added the dwolla -&gt; mtgox option.
What I haven't yet enabled on the web site is the ability to "omit" certain providers (this works in the algorithm but I just havent done the javascript for it yet). Basically, if you see the "omit" column and the checkbox, if you don't want to go via that route, you click on the bit you want to omit and it will try and route around it. The idea is this  : If you choose dwolla -&gt; bitcoin it will present you with that updated route (ie via mtgox). However, if yo  u dont like that route it will present you with the alternate via bitinstant.
Lastly I am not a confirmed mtgox user  - just an unconfirmed one - so I didn't even know they took dwolla . Thanks for the update.

No there is not. No one "knows" that key A and key B are owned by you, apart from your wallet. So, if you receive into A, you can't spend out of B without moving it first as B has a zero balance. Therefore any transaction trying to spend any balance in B will be rejected.

Bitcoin emerged as a currency and has been adopted as the market needed an alternative. It may be that bitcoin is the best possible crypto-currency ever and that Satoshi thought through every single possible future issue. However, if that isn't the case, then let the other currencies do their thing and may the best man win. Nothing will replace bitcoin *unless* the thing that replaces it is better. Think evolution etc etc.

Exactly this. A company that can control a monopoly will do exactly that. The moment they no longer can control it, they will either adapt to use or improve upon their competitors innovations or they will die. Only very short-sighted small companies refuse to innovate.
I can imagine ebay / paypal (amongst other financial institutions) will offer bitcoin services (but hobbled and fee-ridden) to remain always within a few months catch-up of any possible competitor. In fact ... you might find that ebay actually adopt bitcoin sooner than you think as it would then enable those without paypal accounts, debit cards, bank accounts etc etc to start using their service whereas before they had no way in.

What I can't understand is that people need to understand the difference between enabling technology and economic-ideologic differences. This subreddit is about the technology and what it enables. It is *not* about screwing over your fellow man and his family as they don't earn as much as you. So a gun "enables" a poor man to rob a rich man - does that make it morally acceptable ? So bitcoins enable you to hide your wealth  - ditto ? 
Let's take it back a few logical steps. You, your family and a few other families live in a tribe. Some of them farm, some of them raise animals, make tents etc etc etc. But hold on.. every now and then at night a wild animal comes along and attacks. So what do you do ? You "hire" some of your group to stay up all night and protect against these attacks. They can't farm or raise animals so what do you do now ? You "pay" them from the people who **can** farm and raise animals by giving them enough to eat during the day and make their tents for them. Problem solved !! Isn't this a form of tax? Ergo: You must pay tax for the benefit of the whole.
Just because our governments completely mismanage their finances does not mean to say that this dissolves your responsibility to pay tax. If you want to change it, then change it. Don't stick your head in the sand.
Anyway.... I figured that last one wasn't enough for a complete coffee. Hope I have enough in the tipbot to make this work and keep up the good fight.

I think I use a quite low figure to use in the formulas and I will admit I haven't got all of the details yet (for example, I didn't realise dwolla charge 0.25 USD). The plan is to get it working "well enough" and then fine tune the details hopefully with community support.

Hi there,
I've done a rough proof of concept now that works to an android app - the reason being is there is no point subscribing to the whole mtgox web socket io firehouse if you just want ticker movement, so I use an AWS server to pre-filter out the garbage and just zeromq publish the 170 bytes needed for ticker movement.
However... what I would like to do is offer this in a library / jar format to other devs (for a slice of course) and to do that I'd need a level of API key authentication. If your library works well I'd be more than happy to integrate it !

I'm seeing the same. I wonder if it's to do with the litecoin USD rate being in excess of 2 USD (from .50 cents a few days ago) and there is either a rush to sell or someone is DDOS  in order to keep it that way while they get their litecoins together ?
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:04:28
I agree... It may well be a problem if bitcoin starts to be used for the run-of-the-mill regular payments instead of cash, card etc etc.
However, just think of this as the model-t ford of crypto currencies.  We don't drive around in those any more but without them, we'd still be on horses. Who knows, in fifty years time a btc might be a collectors item !!
The only issue about "inflation neutral" is who decides on inflation ?? If it's set by a central body ... well .. then you get all the issues that a decentralized currency is trying to avoid. If it's not set centrally, then how do you award the miners the right amount of coinage ?? Or do we just say "hell, let's make it 2% and be done with it".
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:21:42
The primary issues are technical and regulatory. Let's not think about marketing (if there's no volume, no one will come back) and customer support just yet.
Technically, it's "not that difficult" to do a proof of concept - in fact here's one "for free" in java - called jessx - [youtube vid]( but the issues are going to be the same as all the others have faced, DDOS, continuous hacking attempts (including trying to get your domain redirected) etc etc etc. It's no longer possible to do this with a small team of dedicated techies- there are some fundementals which are just not interesting to a group of free contributors.
Regulatory wise you are heading right to the deep end. Want to "hold clients money?" (which is effectively what you will be doing once you require them to fund their accounts before trading), and you'll need to jump through a bunch more hoops. All these take time, money and of course "acceptance" by whatever governments you want to work with - of course you don't need to accept USD directly into a USD bank account, but if you don't then potential customers will be put off with high fees, transfer costs, time etc etc (look at btc-e for example- the btc price is almost constantly 4% below mtgox price. Why ? As that's the price it costs to fund their accounts).
Soo.... if you want to knock something up that you and a few of your closest and trusted friends can use, then it's not that hard. Otherwise, it's going to be at least a six figure exercise ... and probably a seven figure one.

Because... the merchant might be a hairdresser, a newspaper shop owner, a barista etc etc. The goal is to introduce them to bitcoin gently, and with minimal risk to them. If they have the smarts, then absolutely let's get them trading, but if they just want $$$ to pay their bills at the end of the day then let's start off simple.
I'm not trying to centralize, I'm just trying to provide a relatively risk-free introduction .. and if they like it, they can carry on using it after the introductory (and insured) period.

Another "exactly this". And then, let's factor in the cost of running such a business versus one that has no controls - which ultimately end up as the market fee for transaction costs. An exchange with no compliance department, tax declarations etc etc  has significantly less costs to pass onto their customers ... but ultimately will be closed due to AML

I have had an account there for a few months now and so far my experience with them has been very good. No delays in getting btc in and out (always worth trying getting stuff out - even though they charge a 0.01 btc fee ... hmmm ).. I started using it when I was mining ltc to trade them for btc but now I use it for "trading" when I deposited a handful of btc, I trade into whatever and trade back into btc - the plan being when I need to cash out I will just move the btcs to a european exchange.

not only that ... but it depends on the future exchange rate too... Now the response most bitcoin-economists will state now is that it's better value (if  you believe the rate to increase) would be to just buy bitcoins for $$$ instead of spending that on electric.. but where can you efficiently buy 0.5 or even 0.1 bitcoins ?? (esp if you are not located in the US).

I've thought about the bitcoin / atm market and as interesting as it appears as first, it's ultimately a "race to the bottom". Yes there will be first mover advantage (and therefore some profit) but I can imagine maintaining sustained profitability will be an issue - therefore you'd be better of adapting existing systems to have bitcoin as an additional option instead of bringing out something that primarily and exclusively does bitcoin.

Or you could just get a crayon and write a receipt for "services of a very expensive service for a long time for lots of money who is now uncontactable or traceable by anybody but it was a necessary business expense".
There must be 1000 ways to defraud the taxman and there is only one result if you are found to have done any of them: Criminal conviction - maybe jail time. 
Does btc allow you to think more creatively about avoiding tax ? Yes. But are you going to be looking over your shoulder, listening out for knocks at the door and worried about calls from unknown for the rest of your days? 
Please, I'm not trying to come across as harsh (and I'm sure the extreme libertarians among us will call me brainwashed), but ... what's wrong with just paying the tax, taking the money and then that's it. Ok - by all means minimize your tax liability but not to the point of evasion !!

Saying that, I am not trying to disrespect your effort - more people need to know that ltc mining is currently more profitable than btc mining (even though I am reducing my own $$$ by saying that !!)

Location of the unit, resale of the shares and also the dissolution of the agreement would have to be agreed as well....

My meagre advice: If you have existing hardware, then maybe, just maybe, it's worth getting a performant (ie high MH/$ rate) GPU. It's definitely not worth shelling out on any other hardware right now.  When Avalon have shipped their 800 (?) units, those 800 alone could control approx 66% of the mining market. Now it's going to take a fair few weeks, perhaps even months, before these are distributed and there are other manufacturers about to release their hardware "real soon now", but it's definitely not worth any 4 figure expenditure.

Good luck with the ensuing "taxes are theft" brigade. Here's my somewhat minimal view on taxes: Either pay them, leave the country or run for office where you can change them. 
I don't see the OP running for government or see his immigration application.
One day it will catch up with the OP. Maybe (and probably) not soon, but maybe from the OP's child's ex-spouse in a bitter divorce wanting to cash in for a few extra $$$$ by dobbing the OP into the IRS (or equivalent). Yes once people know you are hiding something that they can get some cash for revealing, it's just a matter of time.

Hi there! I didn't mean for this to be a point of controversy - but I guess if there is no real payment provider for btc -&gt; gbp then it would be foolish to run the option at large loss ... I hope that you find a suitable payment provider who can provide a reasonable rate for you to make this viable. If nothing else, you may get 50+ extra customers every 3 or 4 weeks if the london bitcoin meetup drops by. Hopefully that will help persuade you to keep accepting bitcoin !!
Another alternative is to offer the sale of bitcoins to other customers .. but I guess you may start falling foul of money laundering mandatory regulations then which would be a great deal of hassle for you.

I'm trying to get a "non profit" but "fully redeemable" fund which will indemnify small merchants against losses against bitcoin (which include big FX swings and also "double spending" issues). The type of merchants are the ones where the average transaction is typically under 30 USD, EUR etc. You can read more about it here: 
The issue I face is pretty simple: Pretty much 90% of businesses involved in bitcoins have been scams and the guys running it have run off with the cash. Yes I know there are several very successful ones still around, but without reputation, it's very hard to get trust. I'm working on it though. 
I put an entry on bitcointalk.org ... but that drew the attention of a couple of "I can't believe you haven't spec'd out the hardware and are offering free puts". My response is "this isn't about the hardware or the free puts (where in fact they are actually variable notional forwards but I didn't correct him), it's about getting widespread adoption". However it appears on that forum that they are in the "this is my land don't let the public have it" mindframe. I know there are a lot of cross posters - theymos is the admin of both this and that site - so no offence meant but that's just the response I'm getting there.
I've applied to the bitcoin foundation for a grant to pursue this. Finger's crossed.

agree as well.. apart from the novelty value of being able to use it outside there is no reason.
In fact part of the psychology of casinos is to actually remove the link between the chips and the dollar value of them - so you might find they actively don't want to replace their house chips with tradable chips.

It was never supposed to be a serious suggestion as I agree - any experiment with a fair population size, money, anonymity and a distribution of hawks and doves and you'll never get an optimal and fair for everybody plan.

For a moment, if you "ignore" fees and spread.... the bottom line is that your bot has to be right just 50.0001% of the time - think about that for a minute. Marginally better than flipping a coin. 
Now... factor in fees (which will decrease as your volume gets largers) and the spread .. and you are talking ~52% vs ~48% ... And if you get it wrong, you don't lose everything, you can just close your position when you know it's not a winner - it's better than satoshi dice already !!  
Sooo. the first thing you need to do is get data. Lots and lots and lots of lovely data and basically write some code that trades on this data and then see what happens next (based on historical accuracy). Now the issue here is that obviously you didn't trade so you didn't move the market but it should be at least good enough to give you an idea if your algos are net +ve or net -ve. Not only that, but you *must* trial it during the downswings. Any fool can make money in a climbing market - just buy everything !! The truly clever algos will make money (or at least not lose as much money) when the price is dropping too, then mop up the cheap stocks when they are near the bottom.
You are not looking to buy at the bottom and sell at the top - you are just after "beating the average".

It would be bad. Very bad. Don't expect the BTC/USD rate to double but just think of a large number of companies going under as credit lines get shut down (and credit is the liveblood of any company &gt; 50 staff). You might see a blip in the BTC/USD rate but the cost to society will affect your income far more .. unless you are one of the 5 people in the world being paid directly in bitcoin (in which case hope that their entire client base pay in bitcoin too or they will feel the pinch too).

Good suggestions... I'm not going to be doing this for v1 though but will come back to this when the first version has settled down.
@_date: 2013-03-03 19:08:22
Here's a few things I would advise doing
You have to have a loss leader. You have to let people trial the service for free just to get them using the service. Maybe just let them have 3 or 4 free texts per week / month (?) and then they need to "upgrade" to get more. Let them see how easy the service is. Yes you will loose money on most of the accounts, but you will then get a clear idea of your conversion ratios, and therefore ultimately profitability (if and how much).
You need to put the prices in BIG letters on the first page.
Consider having a few plans - free, premium and "ultimate" (or whatever you want to call it). People love having choice and if you tell them "best deal" ... well chances are people will buy it - you will unconsciously create a comparative "price anchor" so they can then figure out what is good value. At the moment - who knows how much your service is worth ? Even by negotiating "against yourself" you can cut them a deal.
Lastly - put a posting in this reddit -  - so all 18 of our readers can be aware (if they aren't already).

@_date: 2013-04-19 20:53:54

First of all, trades and investments all have to be authorised by compliance departments, who ensure that the business is not in breach of any local regulation (ie the US can't trade with cuba - that kind of stuff). Additionally, we may be excited about the value of the bitcoin market, but this is chump change compared to the fx, derivatives, commodities etc markets. It may be that a few sole employees have put a bit of their private net worth into bitcoin, but even then they are on shaky ground.
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:36:33
Yes I will be releasing the code after it has settled down and become publishable (I guess there is nothing stopping any purchasers from releasing the code anyway - apart from licensing issues). The bigger picture is to make a small %age via cloud manangement - ie not having to be next to your wifi point in order to maintain it ... but that would be version 2
That's a good idea about the QR code. The thing is that I will need the MAC / IP address of the system that wants to access the network - and so therefore that's the device that MUST be on the payment page. Thanks for thinking of that scenario.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:12:12
Additionally, there is only a certain amount of btc being leveraged as investment in a handful of sites .. so when a new entrant comes along, new investors aren't introduced, but the capital of the existing investments are cashed out in order to get in on "the next big thing".... Obviously hindsight is always 20/20 but the moment a credible alternative to AM arrived, then I should have cashed out and then cashed back in after the drop.

First step. Acquire data. Gather as much data as you can from as many sources as you can. This is called "tick" data - ie every single time the price moves up or down, you capture it, the market depth etc etc. Do this for *at least* one week (if you are crazy) or preferably a month if you want to lose your money slightly less fast.
Now apply your trading strategies to this data. This is known as back testing. The trick is not just to make a profit, but it has to be *more* than if you just held onto btc alone. Do not fool yourself and use algorithms that work for some days and not others. It must work consistently well (you are allowed to be net -ve at the end of each period - whether that be day, week or whatever) but over the entire period you *must* beat the gains you would have had just holding onto btc.
Funnily enough I am looking for developers to help me standardize the data produced by all the exchanges in order to facilitate people to do exactly this a bit more easily. The plan is to provide market compatible feeds (thing fix, swift etc) translated from the native market feeds so that all the tools that traders, hedge funds etc use can plug straight in (for a small fee of course!!!!).....
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:34:39
Can I add a "unique selling point" to your pool (and feel free to tip me if this takes off). No mining fees for anybody who is contributing shares ? (Exact definition to be determined). This means that all miners can pay 0 fees on all transactions (including the extraction fee) and when you find a block, you guarantee to make best efforts to include all of your miner's transactions (obviously - you'll need a database of addresses that the miners add their addresses to). Just an idea !

Disclaimer: I'm new at this too.
The "hashed merkle root" is the hash of all the transactions you want to include in the block. You hash it for efficiency reasons - after all you don't want to spend longer and longer hashing the block if you want to include more and more transactions.... so you just hash all the transactions once and use that in your MH/s iterations.

I had this concept a few months ago - I called it "merchant indemnity fund" - as what you are doing is indemnifying the merchant against any potential losses for taking bitcoin (double spends, dramatic fx crashes and any other issues like that). bitcointalk hated it "what you are doing is giving free puts" ( yeah like a hairdresser knows what a put option is) and I even applied to the "bitcoin foundation" for a grant in order to get it up and running (to supply free marketing material etc etc). 
Ultimately, I think it will work... Do not get hung up upon the mechanism (OMG what hardware are you going to use? was one bitcointalk response) or the process, as you will probably need to adapt it for each merchant. You will definitely need a foot in the door at first - a shop or merchant you know personally who is willing to take a risk. I would look for meetups in your area, talk to merchants near those meetups and then get the most keen to visit and spend at those merchants. Otherwise you may face the issue that by the time the first bitcoin client turns up ... the merchant will have forgotten what its all about.
Oh .. and final plug .. put any merchants that do accept bitcoins here :  ("Add a business")....

I think the question is "how can you prove that the random co-ordinate is not just in the middle of a load of your friends' selections ?"... for example, you could just say "competition closes at 6pm" and then you take the hash of the next completed block to see your RNG - that way you can't fix the result, and everybody can check it.

hey ... not a bad idea at all.. I am a little busy with a number of other things at the moment but I may take a look at doing something along those lines. There are a few issues though .. nothing unsurmountable though ..
1) How to get bitcoins into and out of the system ... you really don't want to be typing in bitcoin addresses into a phone - not that the system cant text you a verification code you can then use to join up online (much the same way that other systems verify your phone number)
2) If there is $$$ attached to your number, then it would be more of a target for either direct theft or number forging - ie someone texts from your number but isn't using your phone.
3) International codes etc ... stuff like matching up +1 with the US if the recipient doesn't register with that code.. 
4) fees. Teeny but non-zero. Someone somewhere has to pay for SMS usage. Not that you can't charge a minimal fee for service (0.1%???) and then use that to fund the operation. The thing is that services such as pingit are zero fee and have more reputation behind them.
Again, nothing insurmountable but all just minor issues.
The big question has to be though - exactly who is this for and what are the use cases ? I guess it could be an easy way to get non android users into using bitcoins on their phones. If you can locate that market then you have an ideal test and market feedback group. Any ideas ?

I think we are just having trouble finding a middle ground here. Do I think that one should be forced to pay for anything and everything that the current ruling governments wants the public to fund ? No of course I don't. Do I think that there is a base level of publicly available utilities and resources that all should have access to, regardless of net worth and income ? Yes, I do.
The issue is not as black and white as "are taxes fair or is it just theft?" but more like "how can we make the tax we pay go to the stuff that we think it should go towards?" (grr edit s/work/worth typo)

The issues that immediately spring to mind are similar to the ones that surround any currency exchange place. Namely:
1) You may be holding onto enough cash to make yourself an interesting target for the any cash-related crime. Learn what they do to prevent ths and protect youself.
2) Accepting any form of Credit Card etc will leave you open to the chargeback issue ... And right now I don't think they would favour your side of the exchange - ie you will lose against most customer (or scammer) complaints. 
I thought of a similar business which is indemnifying yourself against taking bitcoin (from a merchant point of view). This way you could visit local shops, change their bitcoins into cash, help any teething technical troubles etc, and still charge a fee less than CC processing fees (as well as provide marketing opportunities to the merchant for any visiting bitcoin geeks!)

The 5970 is a "special" card that ATI bought out which is basically 2 GPUs already SLId... So it's like having 2 GPUS "for the price" of 1. In reality though, at their hayday, they sold for 600 USD I think ... so they weren't really that cheap !!

Thanks for the tips and the tip !! I am quite excited as I have a proof of concept of the whole process flow now (which is a bit fussy but still works from time to time). If you do UK cash sterling -&gt; bitcoins the app will now get the best price from localbitcoins, the current offer price from mtgox and use that to calculate your loss. The goal being that all the major places to get / change bitcoins can be polled "in real time" (but within reason of course) to give you the best route to your bitcoins. Please keep the comments / suggestions coming as I need this advice !!

Hi there,
I think the expression "great minds think alike" comes to my mind here. It was my post this week regarding the raspberry pi powered hotspot (in the spirit of not stealing the limelight I won't post the link here) so I'm glad I spurred you into competition. I think, ultimately, if we are both doing this for the community, open source etc etc, then everyone can win and perhaps we can merge code later on. Good luck !
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:35:57
There is another alternative. The mining fee stops halving at one point and remains at a notional amount (say .. 1 btc). Obviously 51% of the pool would have to agree that this is a good idea .. but then if you think about it, they've got everything to gain. If they set it too high, then they do risk devaluing their current btc holding. Too low and it will mean that not enough miners will contribute as it's not viable.

"Yes" but in reality "the market" (ie everybody else) will also be doing this - and therefore pushing up the price of the passthrough stocks to a point where you will overpay for them (and then they will devalue after the dividend payment has been executed).
Ideally, you need to price the stock at 2 levels - a "cum div" and an "ex div" which would make the transaction fairer.
Good luck though - let us know if you manage to get a few more millibits out  !!
@_date: 2013-03-02 20:52:32
It's good enough for maybe 0.05 btc per day. You'll be told by a load of farm miners to give up as "it's not worth it" .. (hmm I wonder why that is ??!). However, if you believe that that price of BTC -&gt; USD will exceed the current rate you are paying for electricity then by definition it is worth it. The counter argument is that you would better off buying bitcoins with cash - but the counter counter argument is "where can I buy 0.1 bitcoins every other day efficiently ? ie without much transaction loss". I hope that clears it up !!

I actually looked at providing a service that does this. Thank heavens the chaps I spoke to actually had experience in virtual cash etc etc and they advised very strongly against it as the mobile owner can clawback (that's the industry term - not chargeback) any questionable fee on his bill ... and service provider not only has to pay the fee back as well as a punitive fee as well. 
That, and the fact that you don't actually get the $$$ from the mobile owner for sometimes 90 days after the transaction.
Good news - you can probably get your cash back and the scammers will lose out (for once) by querying the transaction with your network.

I didn't get it to mtgox.. I purchase bitcoins from bitbargain /localbitcoins and transferred them there. The plan is to just trade with them until I want to cash out - and then move them back to a GBP friendly route.

I did roughly the same - lost around 15-20 USD worth of BTC on satoshi dice - just seeing how "well" it worked. If I'd just kept that, they'd be worth about 200 USD now..
Then, a few weeks later, I spent "just" 9btc (200 USD at the time) on an order for a BFL Jalapeno miner.... I could cancel this, but I'd only get ~1.25 btc back now :-(

Its 1 x 5970 and 1 x 57xx (I can't remember exactly). The 5970 does 2x325 MH/s and the 5700 does another 140 MH/s... Regardless of what others say, if you can do 200MH/s + AND you think that btc is going to be worth &gt;100 USD, then it is worthwhile you GPU mining (don't use a laptop though!).
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:05:07


Oh yes it does.. You simply go back as many blocks as you want and start hashing from there. Eventually, as you are "faster" than the 49%, you will catch up and overtake and become the longer chain. You could even go back to the genesis block and mine every single block until now funding an invalid address  - effectively taking every bitcoin ever and discarding it forever.
@_date: 2013-03-13 13:42:21

@_date: 2013-09-06 20:09:00
I'm only going to answer 1 - basically this is the reward for taking a huge risk early on, using up electricity, hardware, development time to get GPUs running, inventing mining pools etc etc etc. Just like anyone is free to start their own business and own 100% of the profit (or loss) of its success, these early adopters took that risk with this novel new currency that at the time they had absolutely no idea if it would succeed. I'm jealous (too) but without them, we wouldn't be here today.

I am surprised you have not attracted the attenion and ire of the existing miners !! I posted a post "start mining and start mining now".. and it attracted a load of flack from people saying "NO don't do it". The funny thing was ... they were all mining themselves !!!
If you can get a few hundred MH/s then I say do it. You won't make any money back at this FX rate, but if it should hit 50 USD / BTC then you should be cash positive after elec costs.
And... there's nothing like seeing some free BTCs come rolling in every now and then.
Pick your pool carefully. I did use to recommend triplemining.com - but they can be very sporadic. Go for a big one, like slushs or btc guild. The payout will be very fair after the pool running costs.

You throw the stone away from the sun in a completely random direction. The stone travels through space and lands on the roof of your house. That's the chance of this happening..
[ Rough maths - area of a sphere with radius distance from earth to sun in m2 is approx 4/3 pi * r **2 where r is 1.6 *10e11 .. but to get from 10e22 to 10e19, divide by 1000 - which is approx 30m x 30m]... I hope that made sense.

There are enough funds for a total out-sourced re-write of forum software that has bitcoin payments etc integrated from the ground up.

As much as this does stink, it was the only logical next step that could have happened to bitcoin-24 . The second an authority considers a business / legal entity / account has been tainted by potentially laundered (not even proven laundered) money, then they will freeze it completely in its entirety until they have unravelled the web and separated the untainted and the tainted funds. That's how it works. Even at the end, they can then issue punitive fines (and custodial sentences) to the operator and all others involved if they were complicit. That's why trading on exchanges that don't have AML / KYC checks have such low transactional costs - they don't have the department and staff to do these unfortunately necessary compliance checks to ensure laundered money isn't being cleaned.
The thing that stings most about this is that I am sure most affected individuals used bitcoin-24 to trade with - so they were either heavily long in the btc or the usd... and it really was just a flip of a coin to determine which one you had when the hammer came down.

Ok.... This is dangerous  - and the reason being a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Now I'm not saying that your crypto knowledge is not good enough - but the problem is that if its good enough to create a paper wallet but not good enough to 100% be confident that the random number generator is random (and not predictable), or can be manipulated then you could be opening yourself up to an army of angry users. Consider this scenario :
1) You create a paper wallet creator
2) Someone deposits a large amount of btc into aforementioned wallet

I would agree with another poster about just waiting for 1 confirm - but if you both agree on using the escrow mechanism, you'll be good to go within seconds as they will take care of making sure you get the BTC. 
I would think though that usual prudence is required if you are carrying an excess of cash as maybe "he just wont show up" (after finding out what you look like) and "oh look who is here waiting outside with a few friends". I've not heard of it ever happening but you don't want to be the first !! I've done a few face to face deals and to be honest they go a lot better than you would expect.

I would really not turn this into a donation post - unless someone who is a bitcoin millionaire really wants to send 0.5 btc his way. The guy left a bit dejected but ultimately I think far better educated in the potential issues with bitcoin and potential security issues and in some respect only 0.5 btc isn't a great deal to help reinforce that lesson. It's very strange though - he only ever logged into his blockchain account via an ipad and his non-rooted android phone. He insists that his password is strong - and I believe him - and you'd need his wallet address &amp; password to be able to login. I hope the support guys at least give him an IP of where exactly the offence took place (ie if from his IP, then at least he'll know its a device on his network - although if I was that way inclined, I would just send the pub.key. or password somewhere else and do it from there). 
I'm also letting him get his security together before we do another trade - which I guess in some way in comforting to know he hasn't lost faith.

I would be marginally hesitant just as some wallet implementations may not have as good an RNG as other wallet implementations (think web wallets, closed source clients etc etc). I would be surprised if any existing implementations suffered from this, but I would not be surprised if any *new* "lets-get-a-web-wallet-on-our-site-i-dont-care-making-it-secure" sites have issues.

I respectively disagree with some of your reasoning of point 2. As far as I can tell, there is no reason that Bitcoin decided on an average of 10 mins / block. Perhaps this is just a factor in the blocks * time * size = blockchain expansion rate and that Satoshi arrived at 10 due to this seeming to be a reasonable time that statistically means at higher difficulties then a block will turn up sooner or later and at lower difficulties they won't be churned out too much - but this may be too long for some merchants in the cryptocoin space to wait.
I would propose that although 4 litecoin blocks are equivalent to 1 bitcoin block ( if the machines hashing on each network were to remain invariant until the end of time) *but* 1-3 litecoin block(s) are better than 0 bitcoin blocks, as the network can then focus on building upon that confirmation.
Now points 1 and 3 are definitely true. I can't figure out that whole fee thing that's for sure.
There is one definite advantage in having ltc and btc around and that's arbitrage. I can imagine when mtgox open up to ltc there will be an arms race in getting the fastest exchange connections. Arbitrage is not necessarily a bad thing - it helps provide liquidity to the not-so-big exchanges and as I'm sure we all agree - that is a good thing in view of recent "magic" issues.

I know the horse has bolted and all that but there are some serious whales on localbitcoins who may have been able to fulfil that order.

Weird ... with bitcoin you pay the cash first and settle later whilst in the rest of the financial world you get the goods and settle the cash later....

As a btc seller, I like to count / verify the money first (after showing them I have a wallet with the required number of bitcoins) and then leave the money (in an envelope or something similar) in a place where we both can see it. 
I have done a trade in a casino - which I think is great for both parties as the number of cameras there is immense so nobody is getting out with a HD 720p pic of their ugly mug all over crimestoppers if they try something and also there's nothing wrong with going to your local bank and asking them to band up the cash as well.

Unfortunately I believe it is genetic - as mentioned by another poster referencing dawkins.
I saw an incredible example of this at a train station one day. There was a shopping trolley blocking about 75% of the only exit on a platform. The only way in or out was squeezing past it. As you can imagine, this slowed down the rate of entry and exit considerably. Now .... as each person got to the exit, they had the option of moving the trolley not more than about 2 or 3 meters which would have cleared the blockage completely. Did anybody do this? No. An entire rush hour train full of commuters would rather just single file out one after another rather than one just take 5 seconds longer to help out everybody behind them. I wasn't in a hurry and stayed to watch every person, without exception, wait and wait and wait and then just get past. If I was a psychologist of some kind, and if it could be arranged without fire risk I'd love to repeat experiments like this just to see how selfish and selfless people are in different circumstances.

Exactly. I think you get one bite of the cherry with stuff like this. Look at the crap Avalon were taking 48 hours before that first ASIC got booted up. They (avalon) had no choice but to run their business on the good will of pre-orders and they managed to deliver. So without funding, they aren't going to be able to manufacture to sell to the buyers who are waiting for them to prove they can do it. Very tough indeed.

Ironically I am trying to sell bitcoins.

Hey no problem. Just trying to get a good directory of bitcoin businesses together as there isn't a very cohesive one out there just yet. It automatically adds you to the android app "bitcoin businesses" as well. Here's what it looks like on the web : 
@_date: 2013-02-26 01:07:25
Ok.. Here's what the roadmap looks like so far for phase 0.1 ( the lazy developer version).
Get a version that runs, displays all known places data driven from a json websource, using minimum code (ie effort). This will probably just be google maps api + a data driven json file from the web.
Look at popularity and user requests. See what's the most requested feature / options and work on those.
I'm aware of the issues of just sleepwalking into using potentially closed data sources BUT I am also very pragmatic about what tools to use as well and the market coverage those tools offer. Hopefully if the version takes off as-is, this will bootstrap people into adding more merchants and then I can make the data "open" for people to implement as they wish (within reason - as I don't have funds to provide a high availability web service right now). Add things like "last visited" and "did they really accept bitcoins?" and stuff like that to keep the data fresh... but I will be very much user driven as far as which direction/ features etc to take the app. Any other android devs out there? Want to join in ?

Hi Charlie.
I'll post the amount (!) in a PM so as not to embarrass either of us (but I really don't expect you to cover my nights out!). Ironically (or is it just bad timing), I cashed in 2 x asic miner shares for approx 7 btcs so I was ready to drop some "real" btc your way and of course this morning I read they've gone up to 4.4 ! Typical. Anyway, to answer your questions:
The barman was the guy with the beard in the middle. I think he asked the barman with the lightning (?) on the back about how to do it. I was interested in seeing it work in a real live environment such as a club - as there is obviously pressure on both sides to get the txn done quickly (wasn't sure about tipping in the txn either?).  
Glad you got back to me. As mentioned, I think the bar is a good one and for anybody reading about it and going jeez EVR is awful due to the door policy, well .. that's how clubs work !! I wasn't expecting any preferential treatment in the fact that I'd just flown in from London, avid bitcoin user, developer etc etc.

I agree with the sentiment  ... but ... "follow the money" . What would the cellphone provider gain (at this stage) from offering such a facility ? They would distance themselves from the Visas of the world who are pouring cash into getting cellphone users just to stick nfc stickers on their phone - training them to think of their mobile phone as their wallet. With bitcoin ... no clearing house or middle man benefits - so there is no financial motive to do it, and with the android bitcoin wallet app(s), anyone with a smartphone and enough interest in bitcoin can already do this.
I guess it would be "better" for it to be integrated in with the phones firmware, but right now there isn't a big enough market for this to be a viable development cost :-(

Hi there. It's good to see this is all do-able in the domestic space and would be useful for places where you trust the audience, but it relys on the customer trusting the merchant ( ie the moment it's sold not to siphon off the cash) and there would be a high risk in resale, as the middle man could just affix two more stickers after snaffling the private key - or just printing out a new one and attaching stickers again.
BTW - These aren't supposed to be "stop doing it" criticisms, they are just trying to help you improve on the process to minimize or reduce risk and/or issues later on.

What a great way to endear ourselves to the lawmakers who will basically allow bitcoin to flourish or will crush it with legislation backed by the public once these become the most common uses for it.
Now I'm going to prempt the response "BUT YOU CAN'T OUTLAW MATHS. IT'S BEEN PROVEN". No of course you can't. But you can outlaw anybody using an unapproved currency and the public will be behind this legislation if it is the cornerstone of drug deals and tax evasion.
In the UK we have this term "going equipped" - which is basically if you have the tools to commit breaking and entry and you are outside you home, you can be convicted -  . The similarity I can see here is that if bitcoin is primarily used for illegal purposes, then by bitcoin trading you are "going equipped" to do something illegal, no matter what your argument. 
Then using our draconian "you must give up your password" laws, you can be forced to reveal any bitcoin accounts you own (also filed under the "guilty until you can prove your innocence" chapter).

If it was the case that you speculated that the BTC/USD rate would get to 1000 USD, then hell even CPU mining might be profitable right now*

I am working on a rtd excel plug in which should be able to give you real time data from most markets, depth information etc etc.
The only issue is of trust .. it has to be delivered as an excel plug in plus a com server - so we are talking executables running on your machine that may be the same one that people keep their bitcoins in. So if the code was infected and then propogated, I'd get the blame for people being hacked... 
Put it this way - I wouldn't install a dll from someone on the internet just so I could have rt prices in excel, so I wouldn't expect someone else to.

I spend bitcoin all the time... I was the first person in the uk to officially by a beer (in the Pembury Tavern) using bitcoin (and I've spent probably around 200 gbp on food there for the family). I must have bought half a dozen takeaways from takeaway.com using bitcoin  and also various random bits and pieces from random sites as well. It's a real hawks / doves thing this whole "NEVER SELL YOUR BTC". Everybody right now is speculating the price of btc will go up - or why else have btc ? But *unless* people actually spend it, then it'll become another store of value, not a medium of exchange, which is where it's real value will be.
In other words: **Spend your BTC where you can and then buy back with x currency. It'll help everybody**

Heh. You really think the government give a flying fig about cannabis ? Of course they do - when appealing to the bible belt. Realistically though, they allow their citizens to do this slightly mischievous activity (even though a significant number of other countries - and even some states - have no issue with it whatsoever) just so they can appeal to a certain demographic when it's voting time. Sell something illegal that the government really cares about (pirate DVDs perhaps??) and see how long you last....

I can't really honestly say it's worth buying new GPUS.. however if you can find a cheap second hand GPU on ebay, craigslist etc that you can then resell for the price you paid for it in about 2-3 months (which is realistically when GPU mining will be questionable whether it's financially efficient) then you can still be in the money.
TL;DR Don't buy a new GPU for mining, but use an existing one or buy a cheap second hand one and resell.

From the school of hard knocks - you will never have "enough money" to invest in anything and everything you want to. You'll have to choose. This goes for approx 99.9999999% of people in the world. BUT if you do choose wisely (ie staying in and cooking versus eating out and all those other annoying habits of frugal people), then the NEXT opportunity you'll have slightly more money than you do now and so on and so on.

I agree that the OP should have searched... however... with the constantly changing marketplace and also number of exchanges that have gone under or just gone with client's cash there's nothing wrong with asking for a second opinion. Saying that (and to keep everybody happy):
1) Do a search, find at least 3 options
2) Ask the community "What's the best out of the following?"
Plug: I am developing a website that actively looks at the market, "what you have" and the most efficient route to get bitcoins, based on the amount (to correctly value the fees you'll pay) as well as the time it takes (as changing 50 CAD to BTC that you want NOW will be a different request than 5,000 CA into BTC by a few days).
Edit: I won't paste the beta url here but if you PM me or search for my post submissions you'll find it easily. (Don't want to be accused of being a spammer!!)

You could be buying seashells, chickens, patents, paintings, concepts, air, land, space, moonrocks or fairies. If you buy something, it goes up in value and you sell it, you have made a capital gain. You owe tax. Do you have to declare that to the taxman ? Well ask any famous tax evader and see what there view is.
Bitcoin is not a way of avoiding tax. Yes it does make it easier. No it does not make tax evasion illegal.

Exactly. The "tech" involved in this has to be one of the easiest home-brew projects I've seen in a long time. Bill verifier ? Standard USB interface. Bitcoin network ? All open source. Ok, I'm not saying there isn't a small amount of work to go in to get the workflow / UX right (and I'm not dissing those who are in that profession) but you've already got "working" basis examples of that for phone card top ups etc etc. 
The whole bitcoin atm project is definitely 0.01% inspiration (I have to admit - I don't think it was that much of an inventive step .. sorry) and 99.99% perspiration through all the shit that surrounds the money industry - you don't need an army of techies and a few established entrepreneurs - you need it the other way around. Without the right people playing golf with the right people, this project will never go public (unless they are very very very lucky).

Sorry... but it's not going to work just based on the "trusted merchant" part . The moment someone figures out how this works then they'll just grab your keys and wait until the right moment (ie a min balance of x) and then siphon out the cash.
However.... There is nothing wrong with doing the entire transaction on the card itself - including the signing. Java Smart Cards have just enough horse power to do crypto-stuff and that would be enough to sign a transaction which the merchant could then broadcast. The issue is that the display may be lying to you about the size of the transaction !!
The only "real" way is a hardware wallet which displays to you the transaction amount and does the signing internally (ie no private anything transmitted to anybody else)

This is a disaster.
This is going to put a stone in the shoe of the lumbering giant that is the US legal system. 
What's the best way to piss of senators and congressmen ? I know. Completely ignore the law they made just 2 years ago and carry on. Now I know (most of) the arguments about how it's technically impossible to stop bitcoin, but all they need to do now is demonstrate that bitcoin is used on silkroad for drugs and arms and now "illegal" gambling sites. All they need to do is add CP to that and they'll have all the public support they need to legislate against it. 
Got bitcoins ? You must be supporting terrorism. Mining bitcoins? You're helping CPers get their cash. Selling stuff using bitcoins? You're helping launder drug money etc etc etc.
I was only a matter of time until a casino did something like this. The others will be watching. If the govt don't do anything shortly, a few more will jump on board until the govt are forced to do something. Who knows - maybe they'll just ensure that all gambling sites that accept BC need to prove govt ID for all their players. Don't want to provide that? Then don't do business in our country - and we'll make it illegal for you to do that. If the UK can start leaning on all the major ISPs to block piratebay.se etc you can bet the US can do this. I know about proxies etc etc but it'll still stop 95% of the traffic. Hell .. why don't they then go after proxies ??
I want bitcoin to succeed. For me it's the geeks sticking up two fingers at the corporate + greed + banking + government saying "you know what, we don't like your currency any more - you get to screw around with it whenever you want - we're going to use our own now". 
Seriously, the last thing we want is to appear on the radar of a government in a bad way. Multiply that by a factor of 100 if that's the US govt.

Bitcoin is the model-t Ford of alternate currencies. People don't even know they need it yet. But it will revolutionize finance, like it or not.

Thanks.. Will look at that shortly.

I have always considered bitcoin as a natural progression as to what happens when you piss off the geeks / nerds / computer scientists by stealing via quantative easing. Taxes - well - everybody can see that but hidden currency devaluation .. not so much... I think the best indicator of this is the one thing that people "need" to live - and that's house prices and the current squeeze on the 20+ and their difficulty in finding reasonably priced accommodation. 
Ultimately, I think bitcoin gives "us" a great "BATNA" - let me explain:  We "choose" to use dollars, euros, sterling etc etc as it works for us. We get paid, we spend and maybe even save. Job done ... and up to this point, we haven't had any alternative (not affordable to the common man anyway). Now, we have bitcoin. We have a choice. We can keep our funds in government notes, or, we can start moving some of it to this new development. In doing so, we can signal to the powers -that -be that we aren't happy with their actions on our hard -earned cash.
There are obviously 100s of great technical reasons why bitcoin could eclipse all previous forms of currency, but for me there is one big political one - **stop screwing around with our cash, or we'll go elsewhere.**

why did you say it was going to jump btw ??

This is a point I have made to others.  Bitcoin is the "model t ford"  of crypto currencies.  Was it revolutionary? Hell yes.  Do we still drive them? Not a chance.

What graphics card do you have ? Let me answer this for you, if it isn't high end OR if it's older than 2 years then don't start ... unless you want to just as an exercise.
Next, check this page:  and find your card on it.
If it is an ATI, then install "AMD APP" from here :  - this will allow the mining software to speak to the GPU.
If its an nvidia, you won't get half as much out of it but you will get something. I forget what you have to install for that (if anything).
Lastly, join a mining pool. I was accused of spamming the other day as I mentioned mine TWICE (!) so I'm only going to do that under a spoiler tag: &lt;edit&gt; ffs I can't figure it out so just PM me if you want a link - but there are a dozen or so out there so pick one and join in !
Get mining! you've got about 2 months max before the market is flooded with ASIC miners.

yes, port 8333 will be open to a bitcoind server (which may be any bitcoind on the net or one running on the pi - depending on usability).

I'm adding them as I discover them to the graph. The idea is that I can open up the database to the public and they can add them as they find them (with a bit of crowd confirmation).

No it doesn't tax the cash in your mattress as it considers that cash already taxed. If you live in the US and you hold US, then you are neutral against any EUR / GBP / JPY movement against the dollar. However, if you lived *outside* the US and hold USD, you can bet your ass that your government will be very interested in taxing you. Likewise, if you lived in the US and held EUR enough to make an net profit from any movement, the USG will be very interested in getting a slice.

5. Go to jail as you've lied to the court about any assets that you may have ... and they will find out one day (or leave the country and never return and always be fearful about the knock on the door on the "number withheld" telephone call).

install truecrypt. Create a partition big enough for your wallet.dat.
This may sound stupid, but WRITE the password down (not in document.txt but good old pen and paper). Maybe miss out a few letters AS LONG AS YOU LEAVE SOME HINTS to what they might be. Your memory will be different in 2-5 years time !!
Keep this paper with a copy of the volume. Try and commit this password to memory.
copy encrypted volume to about 5 places (dropbox, google drive etc etc).

I can't see how this is compatible with existing credit card payment systems - surely each merchant doesn't need another terminal *just* for these cards ? Did I miss something ?

what pool are you attaching to ? Is it "nothing to mine" or "nothing to mine on"... If you want the absolute easiest way to mine - then try  (no relation) - as they do all the hardwork for you in a nice gui - with namecoin mining too.... At least that way you can debug what's up with your setup.

Not at all. I would imagine the model is help build it and then take a share of any income generated ( exact %age blah blah blah to be discussed - but fair). Obviously if you add just one line of code that doesn't mean you get production live access for life, but I'm sure we can work something out.

nooooo !! Set up an account at bitstamp.net - then use transferwise.com to fund the account details you are given. Do this now and your bitstamp account will be funded in about 24 hours .. seriously this time tomorrow you will be bitcoin trading. I've done it twice now.

The thing is that a lot of people will be watching the price and if it starts getting even to 250 (wow!) then they'll start profit taking and dumping. Would be great to have "just" 4 mill in the bank to place the order though. Although that 4 mill USD would quickly turn into 2-3 mill in BTC as people started selling and the price dropping...
@_date: 2013-02-19 09:45:38
Yep. Let's not forget "illegal gambling dens" which will really upset the legislators after the poker black friday. All they will have to do is ensure that people "register" their public addresses and that it's illegal to trade to an "unregistered" address (including moving between your own addresses, unless registered). You will be able to verify someones' public address (for your own good) via a government run portal website. Any site or business that does not verify public addresses risks trading with an unauthorised address and is therefore guilty of assisting all of the above.

I run  which has a similar map here :  and also all the listings are user curated - it's easy to add a new listing (which is auto-approved when the memcache expires) and any changes just need to be validated by the email address entered as the "owner" of that business - ie no login required etc etc. It also ties into into android app I run called "bitcoin businesses" which is open source and has about 3 or 4 devs contributing to it currently.

It was like this about 3-4 months ago about GPU mining too... It was "fairly" profitable to mine with GPUs and the amount of hate I got by advising people to do it (but not necessarily buy brand new hardware) - even if it was for just a month - was incredible ..  Interestingly enough - I asked the question "are you a miner?" to the detractors. None of them denied it .....
