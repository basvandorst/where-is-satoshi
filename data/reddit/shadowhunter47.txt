What are the fees on Binance? And I guess thats pretty impressive to double your investment so quick. Probably a combination of luck in timing and skill. Like the other commenter said I’d be cautious
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:49:47
I hope so
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:15:31
What do you think of whats going on right now? I didnt think bitcoin would drop below 10.. now it keeps testing those supports
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:45:00
which exchange are you trading on?
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:17:26
dentists hate him
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:22:33
I hate the article. Its clearly biased. All exposure is good exposure for bitcoin though imo.
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:49:38
I was very happy getting off work and seeing we werent still testing sub 10’s. Seems like short term crypto could be correlating with trade tensions..
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:34:24
Thats a pretty good deal. Is there a wallet that you can move your btc to off it? 
Yeah never do that, greed is whats gonna get you to mess up. Remember your fundamentals. I’m sure you’ll do fine
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:04:34
I love charts, but having multiple indicators doesnt hurt
@_date: 2019-08-10 03:26:00
I agree. With big institution money coming in they wont want bitcoin at peak levels. Im sure theyre working to manipulate it to keep it down to get in at good prices
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:56:41
I have a pretty large amount sitting with the average buy in about 12k so I’ve been looking at a lot of stuff. Based on trends either we plateau for a while and resume a nice growth curve that accelerates over the course of a month+ or we see a parabola by maybe the weekend. Highly doubt we revisit 10k and below. I think we’re done dropping. If we do it’ll be a quick spike and back up. The next high will be at least 15-20% bigger than this last one. I’m confident enough to hodl and wait it out.

Where should I buy and sell crypto? are the other exchanges free as well?
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:11:27
Its wild that something so volatile and seemingly unpredictable can follow patterns like this. I have stake in the game, believe in the trends and market theory enough. Because of this I’m holding on because all the indicators seem like we’re headed for a high. We’re moving quicker now because of the higher volume I assume.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:01:42
Yes.. but I think this pull back will happen sometime in the next week. After that I think the long term forces will have their way
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:20:49
I figured it mightve done that. So I guess it never stuck at the lows to impact this graph.. maybe it follows the same general trend
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:50:05
we can go to 100 but not right now... hype and impulse buys wont take us there
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:17:52
i didnt do the math on this but eyeballing its about 25% dip before shooting up
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:24:38
Do you have a recommendation for a better exchange?
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:33:26
So based on the trends you’ve been watching is this still on par with what youve seen before? From the couple Ive been watching, if it follows the same trajectory we’re about to make a big jump
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:51:56
Agreed. Except for the four digits. We may see those again but short lived. Lowest we’ll ever possibly see again imo is 7k but briefly. After the next pullback if we don’t see below 10 I’ll be in your boat
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:29:27
sell at the next high, buy at the dip
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:50:08
Certainly hope so, but so far so good. Currently bouncing around right around the 25% mark
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:47:25
how long do you estimate til we peak? how did you calc 18k? I was thinking closer to 16500
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:10:31
I remember an analysis done before and it looked like halving was always between two peaks... I’ll try and find it because now I wanna know again..
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:31:14
Theres way too many posts to sort through.. but i did stumble across this 
my theory behind why it occurs this way is the halvening doesnt have a direct effect right away on supply. It only affects it down the line so the effect is always going to be delayed.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:47:20
I’d take that argument. Bitcoin is a lot more established now. Less chance of panic sell there. Also 26% is less distance to 30% than 40%
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:12:02
I expect a couple moderate pullbacks on the way up here, then a spike up, then a larger pull back. Would be interesting to take a look back at this after a week or two lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:34:31
check back in a week
I’m almost up there with you... if you check what happened in 2015 and 17, there were similar events where btc went exponential after a 25% pull back like this. Fingers crossed history repeats... we’ll see this bottom out at 10.5k and rebound
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:48:06
I like to use the log view from Dec 2016 - now. From that comparison it looks like we’re going to stagnate a little bit and then curve upwards over the course of a month or two.
