Oh wow. Well that made me smile.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:12:44
Has it crashed this hard previously though?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:04:31
Well, I see the winds have changed but I'm still a believer and not in the red yet. Continuing to HODL. Will we come out of this...who the hell knows.
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:32:11
Another female buyer here. I never assumed everyone here was male...
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:03:26
No, I'm not. Because the point of this is that you're acting like that's criminal and it's not, it's legal.
And yes, I almost always get money back but it is never equal to what I paid in income tax throughout the year...and again I'm getting a legal tax return.
...and the child tax credit is only for people with children. Which I'm not and I pray you aren't either.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:43:38
I think the whole idea was that enough regular people would buy in and be using it P2P as originally intended that it wouldn't need to be handled the way it currently is. I'm well aware no nation would ever get on board with that. Just bummed out the nature of Bitcoin has changed dramatically.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:32:25
Also, people weren't drawn to Bitcoin on exchanges. Bitcoin was supposed to be peer to peer. If we never left that realm things would be different. Exchanges changed the game.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:44:51
Haha okay. Except I'm a sister. I'm hodling with you. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:20:06
I thought in the U.S they were counting trades between coins as a taxable event? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:39:35
I think some of them will. Just really research what you're buying into (unless you have a ton of disposable money!) and don't put in more than you're willing to lose (in case the ship sinks). There is also GDAX, which is owned by Coinbase but is more comprehensive. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:58:41
That would require the general public to realize inflation isn't a magical thing that indiscriminately and uncontrollably hampers markets and dollar value and rather that a conglomerate of the 1% sit down with the central bank and government and choose to inflict it on the less wealthy people at their whim. It is a hidden tax on the working class that depreciates your money. People should be pissed about it, but they don't understand enough to be mad. And even if they did, I bet you they would be frightened and in denial first.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:45:43
Bawhaahaha I will have to pass on that
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:50:08
Yes, their estate can be used to pay off their debts, but when their estate runs dry you are not responsible for any remaining debts, to my knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:29:23
Just so you know, you aren't obligated to pay your parents' debts off. Debt collectors will call you acting like you are responsible but you aren't. 
Also, my condolences OP.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:24:46
Not to get philosophical on you, but please define progress? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:38:30
I'm seeing 16,000. If it dipped to 2,500 I'd honestly buy more. I think we have at least 5 more years of safe bet growth, with volatility obviously. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:22:26
...coinbase? If you're going for something less popular, like Monero, just Google and research an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:17:29
I meant down from its absurdly high CB price of 9,000+
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:46:23
Why are the big banks so attracted to it?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:25:35
It'll give the average worker the means to own production, if they bought in. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:29:15
I don't think you owe me anything, I simply assumed you had thicker skin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:07:04
You started this whole thing by trying to be a jerk and going "You probably don't even pay income tax!" 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:04:00
Have you worked it out? Unfortunately, I'm not well versed enough on the issue or process to help you or I would...
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:48:58
No need to comment unless you're willing to answer. To be blunt, beyond reading Satoshi's paper and watching a ton of videos on blockchain, this is where I learn. Especially when it comes to learning how people perceive the market and why.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:25
Maybe I'm nuts but this doesn't really qualify as a crash for me. Get us down to two grand again and maybe I'll call it a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:37:04
Ah. Okay. I'm only asking because the U.S has a gift tax and I believe the IRS is including day trading or any purchase of crypto with crypto as a taxable event, without it ever converting back to USD...not sure how true this is though, or if there is a tax loophole/gray area for it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:31
BCH down to three grand.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:01:19
No offense uglymanipulatedpenis, but people without much security can't safely or sanely play the put it in the market *casino* game.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:56
I agree. This is the craziest growth I've seen. We had a dip of like $3,000 (from what I caught) but I'm not intending on cashing out. I'm a long-term believer and I didn't put in more than I'm willing to lose. I just wanted to know what everyone else was thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:46
I'm a little lost here. I've been bouncing around crypto threads asking for someone to share which they feel is the least centralized coin and why. Libertarian here. Always believed in Bitcoin and knew about it for years but didn't follow it religiously and I'm super out of the loop about this whole fork and BCash.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:54:36
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:50:22
Explain more. What the hell is an Asic chip? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:11:11
Even if they simply send it to another person's wallet? No transaction or USD conversion ever occurred. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:55:37
That's not not paying income tax, that's being legally entitled to a tax deduction or exemption. And no, I don't have a child. I've never heard of EITC but I generally let my accountant handle my taxes and determine my legal deductions/exemptions. Take a chill pill.  
Also, if you read my post history more thoroughly you'd see I'm actually concerned my employer hasn't been paying my W2 taxes correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:52:58
Anyway, it was a joking comment, not a serious accusation. I've been into Bitcoin for awhile and am personally upset that it's losing its libertarian aspects. I wouldn't try to skip out on short term or long term capital gains taxes either, simply because dealing with the IRS would be far worse than saving a bit tax wise.
It can be huge chunk of however much your investment has appreciated though, between 15 - 30 percent for long term capital gains tax...and there's really no reason for them to be taxing it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:16:48
Why hasn't someone done that?
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:01:29
Yup. Where's the crypto revolution? It looks like this all has backfired...
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:29:50
Ah. Okay thank you for the info. Yeah, my original post was removed by a mod from r/Bitcoin for asking about this and I was attack by fanatics at r/btc when I tried to ask about it within a thread.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:59
Can you elaborate? Just cause I'm curious and don't understand the BCH/BTC dichotomy and red flag, and want to?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:40:38
I agree with you. I'm hoping for another buy in opportunity tbh. Haha I don't think we're about to see it stabilize at 20,000 for another couple months.
Edit: typo
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:57:50
No, you don't want to be using coinbase...that means we have a centralized currency worse than the banks...you want to be using Bitcoin peer to peer...thats the dream. That's where the money and power is for the people.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:51
What is FUD?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:01:22
Try buying through a different exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:13:45
And I'm neither. But you sir, are a prick.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:47
What do you believe the value cap is without fiat falling?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:27
Hey, hey. Crashes are opportunities if you're a long-term believer and not dumping your life savings in. I think any crash coming Bitcoin will recover from.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:13:59
Another reason to go to Denmark!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:58
I heard they were considering Ripple as well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:46:40
I haven't explored this too much but apparently you can buy on other exchanges for less fees or no fees if you find someone to exchange peer to peer with. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:49:10
How would I end up not even paying income tax? There's no way to evade* it unless you're doing it illegally and intentionally, which is incredibly stupid. 
Edit: Tax avoidance is legal, tax evasion is not.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:04:11
More like PSA: to end the international banking cartel by moving over to bitcoin we will eventually need to end exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:07:38
They really have no right to tax for half the things they do, and the general public/average citizen takes the brunt of it and sees little to none of it returned to them in "public goods". Government = the most successful Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:34
Can someone explain how this is manipulating the market?
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:00:12
The exact opposite of Satoshi's vision...
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:54:51
What a good dog.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:26:30
I would say the morality of that is fairly subjective. I wouldn't.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:38:06
Does anyone think this crypto slump is related to the DOW dropping?
