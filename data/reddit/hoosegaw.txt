Yes, and not only to save from fees. See [this reply]( for more details.

The problem with using non-standard fees, either none or using something lower than the official calculation, is that once you try sending the transaction, it's really hard to cancel it. I tried using the [no-fee mod]( once and the transaction wasn't accepted even after 2 weeks. The only way to get my wallet to forget about the transaction so I could recover the btc was to create a new wallet and import all the private keys from the old wallet. That takes a long time because the entire blockchain must be scanned for every imported key.
The solution I originally asked about would avoid delays because it would still abide by the standard fee structure.

I have about 3500 addresses and 3BTC. Trying to send all in one go results in an error, probably because the knapsack calculation times out (and it's using 100% cpu while that's going on). It even errs out if I try sending 0.1 BTC. So this might even be a more practical reason to combine the dust. When I send 0.01 BTC, I've seen fees ranging from 0.0005 to 0.0015.
