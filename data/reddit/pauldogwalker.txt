There is 750,000 to 1,000,000 bitcoin users on the entire planet. Looking at bitpay's statistics: 
You can see that the number of people shopping with bitcoin is in the tens of thousands, worldwide at best, assuming no one has ever bought two things. 
Bitcoin basically doesn't exist. Canadian tire money is used more widely. The odds of ever encountering even one person paying with bitcoin is microscopic. Accepting it is not worth the trouble.

Bitcoin has been dying according to a bunch of metrics. Number of active users on forums, the price, number of people running nodes, the amount of activity on github, trade volume, fee paid to miners. None of it has looked good, but don't dare mention any of it. only talk about the factors that go up, like only talk about how transactions per day are going up (while the amount of transactions in USD is falling)
@_date: 2015-04-12 23:11:13
The halving doesn't lower the amount of coins that exist, just lowers how many more are made a day. so it could slow a price decline but there is no economic reason it'd create an increase.

If you do the math of the number of transactions in a block divided into the size of those blocks then figure out 1mb you can see that bitcoin can only handle 2.8 transactions per second. Or less than 250,000 transactions a day. 
However gavin told us that gavin would raise the limit of 1mb when gavin has decided the time is right. 
The fact that larger blocks are more likely to be orphaned than smaller blocks and that ALREADY many pools cap their own blocks at 750k, 500k or 250k is also something you should ignore because once again gavin has told us that gavin has some big ideas about what gavin is going to do to make bigger blocks work okay.
Basically there is this guy named gavin that is paid by the bitcoin foundation that made big promises that he will fix everything and he has big ideas how it will work and you just need to trust him that he's totally for real going to do it someday and isn't just saying stuff because saying big stuff makes people give him money. But bitcoin is trust based so all trust in gavin!

The person that told you "good news" gives you money lied to you. The price rises when people buy it at a higher price.

Just promising the future will fix everything without answering how isn't enough. If the graphs were showing adoption = higher fees then we could pretend future bitcoin will just have more adoption but the real world graphs show the fees have dropped over time, in both BTC and USD terms.

The problem to date, dear Ask Slashdotter, is that no digital money company has been able to get their heads out of their technology centered asses and talk to their customers. They would rather put together a presentation that talks about public key cryptography and e-wallets, than actually talk about the benefits to the consumer. PayPal is leading the way because they 1) didn't create a new currency and 2) worked with a paradigm that everyone understands: bank accounts.
What should happen now is that digital money companies should create a product that uses cryptography and all those groovy things and links into systems like PayPal. When digital money companies start talking about what the customer gets out of it, then we'll get somewhere.
On a similar note, what does the customer get out of a flying car? :)

Upping the MB cap will certainly help this issue but will make two other issues worse. 
1) nodes have been dropping steadily. From 13,000 a few years ago to only 6500 now. It's easy to point to advances in hard disks making this a nonissue in the long term. In the short term it is a thing that needs to be considered. 
2) transaction fees currently are very small, making up less than one third of one percent of miner's payment. The has also been shrinking. Longterm the solution to this is simply larger adoption, but again, that has not happened yet, and so it's not simple to just ignore the problem and assume mass adoption will arrive before a certain date.

According to blockchain.info only 15.30744978BTC have been paid in fees in the last 24 hours. That means only $3765.63 in fees split across all miners. While the block reward in the last 24 hours has been $900,000 dollars.
There is very little reason to include transactions. The fees make miners 1/3rd of 1% of their income. No one is going to bother to work harder to include them beyond the bare minimum needed to keep bitcoin from freezing entirely.

Very early on a buffer overflow let people have negative amounts of bitcoin sent and that would loop around to the max value, which is 92 billion, they did it twice and got 184 billion, they patched the bug, but they also had to rewind the blockchain 50 blocks to undo the damage of them existing. 
Flaws like that are certainly not common, but they are the logic of why the 100 block thing exists. A giant flaw like that is bad enough without also having to deal with a bunch of mined ghost coins that might already have been spent and then vanish.

On 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or "block chain" which let users bypass bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins.[15][16] On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the bitcoin protocol

It's based on there being mathematically so many private keys that the chance of two people getting the same one wouldn't happen in trillions of years. 
It is assuming people use perfect random generators though, in real life there has been occasional problems of people using bad generators and ending up with overlapping or easy to figure out keys. So the answer is basically "If you use good random generation it is impossible, if you use a poor random generator you might get robbed"

From about 55,000 a day to 95,000 a day in the last two years means not even double.
 It looks like in 6 years the blockchain has recorded about 62 million transactions total. 
Given that paypal claims 8.5 million transactions a day that means that every 7.2 days paypal carries more transactions than bitcoin ever has in history. At 150 million visa clears more transactions than bitcoin ever has every 10 hours. 
So the number of transactions is still truely microscopic. Beyond that although numbers of transactions have risen the amount transfered has remained nearly static. Meaning it's simply more transactions to transfer the same amount of money:

You don't actually want it to come out. As vaporware it serves the important function that if bitcoin has any flaws you can just say "sidechains, sidechains!" and deflect the question. If sidechains had actual properties that actually existed people would be left without explanations on how bitcoin will fix it's technical flaws. Sidechains let us pretend that no matter what the issue that someone will both invent an altcoin that solves that issue AND that they will shackle their superior alt to the premine of bitcoin to enrich bitcoin early adopters instead of enriching their superior alt's adopters.

Side chains are a vaporware buzzword. They are basically just altcoins that you can buy with bitcoin and then redeem for bitcoin. They make a great hand wave for any problem bitcoin has because someone somewhere could potentially make an altcoin that fixes any problem bitcoin has, but in that case if people are making altcoins that are so great why even bother involving bitcoin?

Someone basically did do that. Satoshi dice originally used an on blockchain method of betting that made blocks so big that satoshi himself put a max cap on the block size and a minimum size on transactions in the form of the dust limit. Then satoshi dice just out of being good people changed how bets worked to not be so spammy. 
The scary thing about that is that being a betting site satoshi dice didn't even have to pay for the DDOS they accidentally made, they had people paying THEM to participate.

Despite having the random slogan of "be your own bank" bitcoin provides very very few of the services banks provide.

He clammed up specifically after someone made a huge well researched post asking some hard questions and dug up his hella shady past:
Hi Jason,
First off, I want to say that I believe Seans Outpost has a tremendously valuable mission. Any organization that has served over 125,000 meals to the homeless is doing amazing work, and deserves to be commended for that.
When it comes to charitable organizations, I believe that transparency and accountability are extremely important. It is always the responsibility of a community to ensure that the individuals and organizations it entrusts with funds are using those funds responsibly. When an organization chooses not to make use of either cryptographic safeguards like multi-signature controls and public blockchain accounting, or the traditional structures for transparency and accountability such as 501c3 status and public financial filings, that communal responsibility is increased.
For the past few weeks Ive been trying to get a full understanding of Seans Outposts operations. Based on my conversations with a number of people, there are several questions that have continued to be troubling. Obviously you are under no obligation to answer these questions, and they may seem aggressive, intrusive, and unfriendly, and for that I apologize. As I stated in my private message to you a few weeks ago, I'm not trying to be a dick, just trying to create sustainable best practices to protect people. I believe these are the sorts of questions that anyone asking for peoples money should have to answer, even if it is unpleasant to do so.
On September 26th, the State of Florida initiated administrative dissolution of Seans Outpost for failure to file an annual report. On October 27th you said in a comment on reddit,
We have already done the process to become in good standing again it's just not reflected on the sunshine website. It is quite embarrassing, but ultimately doesnt effect operations at all.
According to the State of Floridas Corporation Annual Reports/Reinstatements office, they have no record of any action initiated to reinstate Seans Outpost, and the people I've spoken to affiliated with Sean's Outpost were not aware of the dissolution until yesterday. Can you explain this discrepancy? Surely being legally dissolved has at least some impact on operations? As one example, this Florida statute which can be found here seems to prohibit the solicitation of funds prior to the approval of a charitys renewal statement.
In conjunction with your Bitcoin Across America project, in-browser wallet company Kryptokit provided Seans Outpost with an RV. Whose name is that RV currently legally titled in? Is it being used for Seans Outposts operations in Pensacola or Dallas?
In regards to Seans Outposts finances, has anyone other than you had direct control and access to the cryptocurrency donations to Seans Outpost since the organization was started?
What is the total amount of cryptocurrency donations received since Seans Outpost began? What percentage of these funds have been spent on Seans Outposts activities in Pensacola and Dallas? What funds remain?
Since August of 2013, Bitcoin address publicized on the Seans Outpost website (1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd has received a total of 483 BTC. On at least one occasion, a QR code provided by Seans Outpost caused a donor to give funds to an address other than the publicized address. You initially said that the alternate QR code had been inserted by a malicious hacker, but later explained that it was an inadvertent mistake by a web contractor that had been resolved. Are there any other occasions where a donation was made to Seans Outpost to an address other than the ones publicized on the website? If so, how much has been donated that is not factored in to the 483 BTC total above? What address or addresses were used to accept donations prior to August of 2013?
On October 27th you stated in a reddit comment that you
do not derive any salary or monetary compensation from Sean's Outpost. In fact, the cost of running Sean's Outpost has greatly outpaced the amount of donations we have received. The additional costs of operating have to date been covered by wife and I.
Are there any of your expenses paid out of Seans Outposts donations that you don't consider to be monetary compensation? For instance, have donations paid for your meals, lodging, and travel to conferences? If so, how many BTC/how much USD would you estimate has gone towards these expenses? Finally, how much money/BTC have you and your wife donated to Seans Outpost, outside of the time you have donated?
Are you the same Jason King who was involved with the following companies and projects?
The Ambrose Estate ScrollQuest game/treasure hunt project. There appears to be a large community of people who believed they were the victims of fraud in conjunction with this project.
Aeon Integrity Systems, which was dissolved in a tax forfeiture proceeding. There is a Jason King listed as a company director.
Versatile Service Solutions, which was dissolved in a tax forfeiture proceeding. There is a Jason King listed as a company director.
Randall Roberts Incorporated, which was dissolved in a tax forfeiture proceeding. There is a Jason King listed as a company director. There is a Kyle Swank also listed as a director.
Helix Broadband, which was dissolved in a tax forfeiture proceeding. There is no Jason King listed as a director, but there is a Kyle Swank listed as a director. It also appears that there is a Jason King who claimed to be the founder of Helix in a Slideshare presentation from 2010, and the same Evan Jensen who worked on Ambrose Estate also lists Helix Broadband as a previous place of employment. It appears that you and Evan Jensen are Facebook friends.
I sincerely hope that these questions can be addressed.
