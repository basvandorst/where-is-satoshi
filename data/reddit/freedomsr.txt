Maybe if you put a btc plate on your 1996 Corolla someone would think you are cool too.  Get a life lol.  
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:06:17
The only one that looks like an ass is you...fan-girling over someone making a poor investment which is the fancy car.  Maybe you can slobber on one of these dudes ballsack for a quarter of a btc
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:59:13
Still dont get why people blow it all on a car
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:39:10
What if we trade bitcoin for alts but haven't sold any alts for USD.

You can look into bounties.  Doing a task in return for a reward.  Just need a computer and I guess a decent IG, twitter, FB following

You know I'm not trying to be one of the shorts here.  I see the landscape for crypto being much more fruitful for investors say 3-5 years down the road.  The way I'm choosing is to find a few alts that I believe in and continuing to buy as the price drops.  Making sure not to buy during times of strength so when we finally do see a move similar to last year's, il have had stocked up a bunch of cheap coins.  If I had more capital i would buy the top 10 coins in terms of market cap and stack some bitcoin and etherium while I'm at it.

Thank you

Get your principal out, let the rest ride. Holding still
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:44:27
The ICO crowd could still do it.
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:11:42
Gotta be on the right side of the rig
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:19:15
I dont know about most promising but i got decent prices thanks to this dip in ICX and WAN.  Sentiment is still high and news flows pretty frequently.  These are both sub 1$ and wan was over $10 at one point.
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:19:18
Down around the same.  All you can do is take advantage of prices and make sure you live to see the turn 
@_date: 2019-11-18 18:55:24
Ive heard non boomers call it a scam as well.  Lets not crap on the experienced folks in our society

Yo smart! My sister is a street artist and muralist but is, like many of Americans youth, anti-capitalist at the moment.  Dont ask why, she will never get into btc 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:46:47
So do it:D
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:04:17
Did you or in hindsight would you have sold when btc was around 15k and falling more?  Or just hold all the way and accumulate?
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:20:47
The world has peaked, its all downhill from here
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:20:00
Did you get the castle too
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:00:08
You got a good price but we aren't out of the shit yet.  Been holding the 6-6300 area for a week or two with a touch of 5800. Hard to say but trend has been down
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:47:19
This thing will tank in Jan..if we cant get back to a decent level, the end of year sell offs will plunge this thing very far down
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:11:35
Nailed it
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:07:05
I think its tied to people spending a lot for holiday and maybe clearing their books for the new year. Unless christmas goes away well see bigger red candles to start the New year
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:31:23
Those folks are probably still waiting to get their cashouts...seems thats another pain in the ass process
