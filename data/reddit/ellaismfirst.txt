Many do not know super pure coin, a copy of Ethereum
but No pre-mine, no ICO, 100 POW
No contentious hard forks. Stability is a feature.
  
Let's start.
I will consistently write everything I like about this coin.
1.  
2.   
3. 
4. 
5. No pre-mine.
6. Only 4.6 million mined. 
The most important message from the developer and what I like.
1. Ellaism is a network without pre-mine, thus its development team is decentralized. It is expected that there will be multiple teams developing on the Ellaism blockchain.  
2. Core has a public inspectable roadmap. And it is what you’re seeing right now. Every year, we publish a new short-term roadmap, for the coming year, three months in advance (November to February next year). The community always has the chance to propose changes to the roadmap.
Taken from here  
I like the idea of a developer to create a really democratic crypto currency.
The ethereum moves to the POS, all miners will mine Ellaism, without pre-mine, no ICO, 100 POW.
This is what is needed and what is not in any other crypto currency.
Remember disputes about hard fork?
This is what will give power to the owners of coins. We need to develop this more.
This crypto currency can overtake the etherium and even bitcoin.
Only 4.6 million Ella were created.
Look at this 
In the etherium, 80 percent of the coins belong to a small group of people.
Principles of Ellaism
(Derived from Principles of Bitcoin)
All changes and upgrades to the protocol should strive to maintain and reinforce these Principles of Ellaism
Monetary Policy: 280 million coins.
No censorship: Nobody should be able to prevent valid txs from being confirmed.
Open-Source: Ellaism source code should always be open for anyone to read, modify, copy, share.
Permissionless: No arbitrary gatekeepers should ever prevent anybody from being part of the network (user, node, miner, etc).
Pseudonymous: No ID should be required to own, use Ellaism.
Fungible: All coins are equal and should be equally spendable.
Irreversible Transactions: Confirmed blocks should be set in stone. Blockchain History should be immutable.
No Contentious Hard Forks: Never hard fork without consensus from the whole community. Only break the existing consensus when necessary. Many feature upgrades can be carried out without a hard fork, such as improving the performance of the EVM.

You dont need  fight. A copy of  ethereum has already been created.
Ellaism is an Ethereum-like network. Features include:
No pre-mine, no ICO, 100 POW

Greg Maxwell you are a wonderful person and I like your belief in the idea. 
Ellaism is a network without pre-mine, thus its development team is decentralized. It is expected that there will be multiple teams developing on the Ellaism blockchain.
Super pure coin.  No pre-mine, no ICO, 100 POW No contentious hard forks. Stability is a feature.
