So if I have an atom, and I split it in half..

Maybe a currency isn't made from intrinsic value alone, heck, we use fiat to buy things with intrinsic value. We used to trade X thing with intrinsic value for Y thing with intrinsic value, but what is worth more, an apple or a watermelon? spinach or asparagus? How do you trade these? What if all I have is peanuts, but the apple salesman only trades for oranges, but I want those fucking apples. Hence, currency. Intrinsic value doesn't matter.

My last one of a couple thousand worked fine(weeks ago), bigger stuff takes longer.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:27:13
Crypto is cool and all, but to use it as your religion is a bit too far.

The Roman empire was also a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:38:16
I never changed it, it kinda feels like you're looking for pity and for people to send you bitcoin, my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:51:44
Well, it's guaranteed to be worth less. 1€ 10 years ago bought much more than 1€ buys now, and things didn't get more expensive, the € got cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:19:53
Shit, I think I saw a spoiler.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:30:28
That's the thing though, you do know.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:40:38
Smart, but what a dick.

Don't buy now, it's an ATH. Too many people are buying when you should be selling. Don't listen to HODL people, listen to the guys cashing out and buying houses, they are the ones riding the wave properly. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:47:10
Maybe the shills accidentally cross-posted for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:27:21
I think something becomes a bubble when you start to try too hard to prove it's not, leave it be, dude.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:13:28
ETH Cannot even scale with CryptoKitties, I kinda don't see ETH going anywhere, Bitcoin will be on top simply due to being first and the hype. The same way my mom calls all consoles "Game Boy", all cryptos will be known as "Bitcoins".
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:05:42
An exchange and then run with the funds.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:48:34
Yeah, those guys are known to be trustworthy...
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:41:17
I have only my national ID, en the EU you don't need a passport, and I have no driver's license(will arrive in like february) it pains me to think of the exchanges I missed, forced me to use bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:05:42
And historically it doesn't go on forever, HODLing is smart, cashing out when it's real and palpable is wise.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:50:28
It kicks in for everything, I've gotten it for 0.01.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:43:24
I retract the initial part of my statement, then.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:36:57
Dude, I know people that make 1500€ per month, and spend 1500€ per month, and are completely at loss as to why they can't save up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:13:12
How much does the 20% downpayment lower the monthly payments?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:32:22
Don't trust anything, I know for a fact there are many many paid users on all crypto subs, fb, twitter, IG, forums, etc. Getting paid to bash one crypto and hype another.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:54:54


Well, you're in for a ride.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:41:44
We are fickle creatures. I am putting in 1000€ when it's lowered a bit more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:58:07
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:32:56
Super clever, but dick move.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:48
How can it be legal? Seems like so many exchanges are using the fact it's unregulated to fool people.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:46:56
Starwars Battlefront 2 is also on discount
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:35:27
How could you lose money with bitcoin? Dude, read at least a paragraph, leaving those $2K in would have doubled/tripled by March.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:16:05
What you did was wise, the memes are just memes. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:12:57
WIll never happen, x10 is probable(hitting $100,000 per coin) but that means you made a grand total of $900.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:11:00
Why is everyone buying at selling time? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:50:26
What do you mean by "using"? More than half of people are just buying because FOMO. I wouldn't call that using. People buying it without understanding it doesn't help make it stable, that's basically the idea of Beany babies.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:14:05
No need to act like that, he was wrong to talk about Morocco like that, and you're wrong to talk about Europeans like that too. Let's face it, if any country from Africa is to join the EU first(in 10 to 20 years), it's gonna be Morocco.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:28:23
These came to me in a dream
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:43:28
To be stable it will probably go down back to $10,000. Inflating to $100,000 is the opposite of stable, man.

Episode 4 tonight 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:49:46
You should really learn about bitcoin before investing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:12:31
Experienced it first hand, it's insane.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:45:29
The people that use that are usually the opposite of blissful.

This is what I have been saying for months(BTC will be the gold of crypto), but I wasn't aware that lightning would be it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:46:08
Fully undetectable 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:28
In the end it keeps the market stable.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:48:06
I wanted to sell before to keep a nice ass profit from Saturday, but had to start a laundry and suddenly it was way less, still profit though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:55:09
Yeah, this is absolute bullshit, I hate to say it, but BTC needs some central authority with a service standard...
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:27
\&gt; btc crashes
\&gt; Coinbase goes offline so you can't sell
\&gt; MFW 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:37:37
same here, I guess too many selling and traffic like crazy
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:10:17
But that sweet impact factor is all higher ups care about.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:58:33
Yep! And fuck actual real data, let's just make it up, the reviewers won't check anyway. Academia right now is so fucked up, the true passionate people leave because the ego-fueled data faking psychos are the only ones that can handle it.
