It's still the number in the code that's the reason why but it might be even less that 17mil people have been care less with there btc.

Not necessarily because wallets on exchanges are still individual wallets it's just that the exchange controls the private key. There's no way 700,000 address have 1btc away from exchanges. 
Quote me if I'm wrong guys?
