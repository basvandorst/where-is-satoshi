We implemented our own bitcoin payment system (no 3rd party bitpay.com) two weeks ago and we had 5 sales in bitcoins so far. It's about 3 % of the whole sales but I did not really start to promote this new payment option. I am optimistic and I expect more and more bitcoin sales ;)

Or why should the porn sites use any third party payment providers like bitpay at all when they could use their own BTC payment system? We have our own system for that and it works fine. No regulations and no processing fees. That is why bitcoin is so much better than credit cards.

I am Queensnake, a kinky tech savy girl and enthusiastic about bitcoin. Bitcoin subscription is the default payment option on my deviant fetish site btw.
About the CC/Bank's standards, they actually limit our free speech very strictly, especially in the fetish porn industry. For example I had to remove a bunch of my videos and blog entries because they were against the CC/Bank's rules. There are hundreds of "forbidden" words I cannot even use on my sites. They are monitoring us regularly and they can drop us anytime they think our content is not appropriate or acceptable for them. That's nonsense.
I hate that some private companies tell me what I can do and what I can talk about or for what I can spend my money online.
Bitcoin is my only hope to express myself freely, to do and talk about what I like. 
I am going to launch a site with my banned content (banned/prohibited by CC companies but not illegal) which will have only Bitcoin payment option. I think it will be an interesting experiment. I am curious if people are willing to use bitcoins to get some very rare fetish content. We'll see ;)
