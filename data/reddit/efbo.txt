is made to be a circlejerk though. It's basically in the name. Every second post on isn't about how bad consoles are.

I didn't mention them. Never been on any of them. All I know is that this sub is very much a circlejerk and someone comparing it to another circlejerk isn't really a good defence.

What are you on about mate?
Stop getting so jumpy, it's part of the reason I don't take this subreddit so seriously. Everything is so hyperbolic. There's no reason to be so insecure hahaha.
You keep talking about the state of other subs but I'm just saying that the state of this one isn't good at all.


I was responding to a comment where someone compared this sub which should be serious to a joke sub. I haven't commented on the state, usefulness or politics of any cryptos. I'm just commenting about this sub.


I don't think you get the point in subs like that. A circlejerk sub is where you make jokes and make fun of some sub or group. This sub is basically it's own little circlejerk and you are demonstrating that so well here. You're so insecure that you're calling me irrelevant or a shill where I have not claimed to be important and have just criticised the sub without commenting on any particular crypto or saying that any other sub is better or worse. 


I'm not commenting on that though so stop bringing it up lol. 


I was making a better comparison as to what this sub should be equivalent to in the above user's analogy. is a place to post jokes and be hyperbolic with stuff. That's the whole point in it. This sub shouldn't be like that. It's not a good thing to compare be comparing what should be a serious sub to.


Exactly, yet there are so many posts about Bcash and making fun of other coins you wouldn't be able to tell.

I lived close to OverclockersUK so used to go in and buy stuff rather than waiting and paying for delivery.

If you're a 20 minute walk from one of the biggest computer shops in the country though it doesn't make sense not to.

It says worth $10 on the coin.
