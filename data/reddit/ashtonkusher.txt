You sound like a pretty gullible person to send 300K to an online company you have never done business with.

What problems are stocks facing? And why dont you just short some SP futures if this is what you really believe.

Stocks are dumb... That's a great argument.

I️ wouldn’t feel bad for them if they lost their money on stocks, bonds, etfs, reits, or a stamp collection to be clear.
There is implied risk in any trade you make. If you can’t handle it or cry on the Internet after you lose your money I️ have no sympathy for you. 
If you don’t know the difference between a speculative trade and an investment you can look it up on google.

"Do you feel sympathy for the people who invested in Bitcoin".... 
I'm gonna stop you right there. None of these idiots are investing. Pure speculation. I am glad they are losing their money.

No, there is no correlation between the SP500 and fake internet money.

I'm sorry Weedsmoker4hhunnid20 your money is gone.

I do not have an opinion on facts. You can look up the difference between Speculation and an Investment on Investopedia. Bitcoin is speculation.
