Bitonic.nl sells Bitcoins out of own stock directly to Dutch consumers with iDeal. iDeal is a Dutch payment method which enables consumer2merchant transactions without chargebacks.

Fraud isn't the best way to go if you depend on this income. Switching to Bitcoin however.

Because it is easy!

They rented the domain. Of course they can put the source code of the website on Github and accept pull requests.

And they were like: "Okay honest mistake, could happen to the best. Here's your money back"?
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:51:48
Actually a great point.
This is a _very_ easy way to sell your Bitcoins. Perhaps you won't get the best price, but you won't have to go to a shady site like BTC-e.

Did 5 withdrawals totaling about 7000 euro, all arrived within a workday.

I don't see any upvotes and downvotes. We need them if you want quality posts on the top!

Even a lot of people in your channel's target audience probably don't understand Bitcoin. I'm a programmer myself and most people around me don't understand a thing about it.
I would be interested in donating. You could use a 3rd party platform like  but you could also setup your own Bitcoin wallet and let people directly donate to you. I'd even prefer that.
As long as you provide proof that you are the real deal (put a video on your channel for example).

This was pretty damn easy if you ask me:  (actual video of someone paying with Bitcoin in a real life situation)

As far as I know each address has a private and public key.
In Coinbase' case they keep it for you, they are a reputable company, but technically you don't really have control of them.
Using a wallet like the newly introduced  or blockchain.info/wallet you do have access to the keys yourself.

Not sure how that would go
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:24:24
Uhm, that's just a message of someone sending coins to that address. It's not the owner of that address sending that message. I could have send it and have it displayed there.
That "starving student" actually owns 3.3 BTC.

And otherwise a opt-in merchant list like Bitpay would be great.
I don't know about you guys, but these days I'm googling "product bitcoin" to see if I can buy a certain thing with Bitcoin.

Accurate translation. Your last sentence could be improved:
Usually experiments of the Innovation Center last no longer than three months. How ABN Amro's exactly will experiment with Bitcoin is currently unknown.
I especially like this part:

This is how it should be imo.
Kraken also has a Bug Bounty by the way:

But gladly Bitonic.nl is trustable so we won't have to worry when we sell to you :-)

I agree, shops might be thinking: "Why aren't we getting any sales thanks to Bitcoin". Well hello: we have no idea who you are ;)
Find your target audience.

I have a question: what was the process like? You contacted a law firm and they contacted the person overseeing the MtGox bankruptcy? Really curious :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:40:56
They sold ~1350 bitcoins in the past 24 hours and are responsible for 25% of the total EUR sales.
Remember, these are only Dutch (and couple Belgian) consumers!
