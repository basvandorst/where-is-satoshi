I'll check out that chrome issue. If you send me the address you used in the contact form or private message I can investigate what happened with the payment.

Yup, that is a problem. I'll get that added shortly!

We're working hard to get more advertisers to up those payouts! I think we're on par with the other free bitcoin sites, but there is potential to go up a lot more. It's all market based and right now our advertisers are getting a tremendous bargain IMHO.

Sorry to hear you had problems. The payout should happen instantly. Did you click the "NEXT" button to cycle the next ad? This is required to get paid. If you think something went wrong send us your address in the contact form and we'll investigate.
