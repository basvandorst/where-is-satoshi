I think its people that are trying to Trade or Sell before a dip that deserve to lose, which from the comments seems to be the case. ive been buying btc since $50 i had over 200 btc but i did, spread my wealth, sold some and invested in stocks that havent even or ever will come to as close of the gains ive gotten from btc. 
its not dopamine your high on, its success and the doorway to financial freedom. 
keep buying keep holding. by the time you're ready to sell, you wont need too.

moron. people have trillions invested in startups that revolve around ethereum and bitcoin. with the money that's invested outside of the currency it's already to big to fail. i own 2 bitcoin atms and make 3k per month in profit. and there are thousands of other atms. so keep trolling and holders will eventually cash out millions

Fuck you you fuckin idiot. i have proof and can send screen shots. i reached my monthly limit within 3 days which was 15k apparently that was suspicious behavior so they banned me. i signed up to bitpay and gemini and its the same thing, they only allow $100 per day in deposits thru a US bank account thanks for your troll ass feedback dumfuck kill yourself
