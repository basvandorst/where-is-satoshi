the real reason is to get rich quick, let the sheeple hodl paper profits while the smart guys cash out.

doubt NSA level 0 day exploits are only worth 10 btc.

stall for a couple more years. their corporate masters do not approve yet.
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:52:12
that has been debunked on r/BitcoinMarkets , the type of rule change they have applied for has never been automatically approved, so there is no precedent.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:54:48
how big a dip we talkin
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:12:22
this ride is such fun /s
@_date: 2017-02-23 09:19:27
who cares, just make another crypto. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:25:52
does anyone need decentralized blockchains besides drug sellers?
unless it scales and is competitive with visa its a waste of energy.
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:34:20
to tired of this shit. just do something. anything.
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:35:49
$1 per transaction as the fee. scale this already.
@_date: 2017-02-05 02:53:51
loud bark, small bite?
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:48:53
just buy gold then. wtf.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:54:08
pow change will jolt people to act.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:52:47
fake and gay

@_date: 2017-02-15 02:41:51
what were they expecting, cookies and milk?
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:48:35
a few holders realize that without advancing they should cash out of the artificial bubble. its unrelated.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:43:48
maybe he meant that he didnt "write" it as in publicize it, it was just a draft for his private ideas.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:29:38
lmao. what a joke. I bet it crashes when it sees any altcoin blockchain too. 0 fucks given though. get some real dirt.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:12:31
could just be variation. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:43:27
good? this from a team that wants to block increasing blocksize to avoid centralization. If there is a split then this pool will control majority hashrate in the core chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:12:27
cool. now let the market decide. you arent the central authority.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:10:39
actually more like proof that they really believe that without change bitcoin will become like myspace, and get outdone by facebook.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:42:27
if other people think it will go up even further. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:27:29
ty core devs /s
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:38:35
nice one.
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:35:00
this kind of news makes me believe BU actually will take over. Despite initial issues with devs, once it gains traction more devs will help. sort of like early bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:13:18
it means they will attack the minority network. this guy has said so many times.
@_date: 2017-04-06 10:16:18
lmfao, so realistic :D
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:31:58
so many experts!
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:26:38
so you want BU to fork off?
@_date: 2017-05-14 08:06:19
transaction fees will.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:41:19
it was rejected, stfu with fake title.
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:25:11
how much hashrate does this guy own?
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:47:17
Is it worth selling before Aug 1 and then buying back on the segwit chain only? Or better to hold, then keep the segwit coin and dump on the UAHF 2mb chain?
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:31:24
FAKE NEWS!
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:33:17
lol, guy just wants to keep his 50 million he scammed off the ATO. Gotto keep up this facade.
@_date: 2017-07-06 05:18:51
if you understand that bitcoin is a ledger , then if the fees are too high, people will use a good enough but cheaper ledger. 
Think of transport, people can use public transport, taxi, private car or Ferrari. Bitcoin is like the Ferrari , kind of overkill and expensive right now.
