Good experiences with zipzapinc.com . No verification needed (only phonenr and email address). Order btc, pay either via bank transfer or with cash/card at a selected payzone point (30k+ locations).

There's some remittance services using local ATM's for Mexico (sendbitcoin.mx) and Phillipines (rebit.ph) that I know of. Anyone know of any other countries having a similar service set up?

It's really that simple as you get a payzone payslip sent to your email. Go to the selected payzone paypoint, which for me is a little shop which sells lottery tickets etc. around the corner, show the barcode on the payslip (on my phone), attendant scans the barcode, pay with cash/card and the btc will be sent within the hour (usually takes around 30 mins). So this way even the person behind the till won't know you're paying for btc if you don't want him to. Not sure about their limits, think it's 300 per transaction, max 3 times a day.

If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck

I'll sell you some honey for BTC if you're interested :) (and keep it in BTC)

That wasn't me! We sell most of our honey in bulk, but no effort to fill up a few jars of raw honey after extracting if people are interested.

You can only walk there (6-7 days) from Lukla. Which means you have to fly into the most dangerous airport in the world or spend at least a week walking up to Lukla in the first place.

That's not climbing Everest, anyone with a basic level of fitness and persistence can get to base camp.

Can vouch for Transferwise, would've saved you over $300.00 from the comfort of your home. Bloody banks.

Maybe on the Tibetan side, not the Nepali side as far as I'm aware of. Unless you're talking about riding a donkey or a porter's back. (Might've changed as I was there in 2010)

All my transfers have been completed within 2 days and sometimes even the next day. You can see the status of your transaction at any time.

Are you running any AV software? Had an issue in the past where my AV would put certain .db files in quarantaine, which caused Armory to not show any balances. Think it was avast iirc.
