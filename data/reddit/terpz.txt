somehow i suspect you weren't saying the btc rise wasn't sustainable when we saw it go from 5k to 20k.

it's up over 2% the last 24 hours dude.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:11:50
What I'm saying is that not reporting the btc gains IS actively trying to evade the tax,  but the penalty will still just be the higher penalty. It's unlikely anyone's going to jail. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:13:21
you tell me
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:26:42
people will be selling contracts, not buying bitcoin. The expected prices from the futures contracts will lead to people buying/selling bitcoin based on expected future value, becoming a self fulfilling price
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:39:43


Or send you a letter asking for a larger payment with higher penalties, more likely.

Dude wtf are you talking about. Exchanges show the price someone is willing to buy and sell out. You obviously have no understanding of how exchanges work.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:42:23
just transferred 1btc from my trezor to my gemini--- time to cash out some gains. i've been sitting here anxious for the last few weeks because of how much a percentage of my assets bitcoin has taken up. will be glad to have something to show for it finally. i bought in '13.

the only annoying part is that I would have sold $3k ago if I thought there was any chance of my money getting from Trezor to Gemini in a timely manner. I would've just bought back around now.
Regardless, I'm taking a break and not checking prices again until Wednesday. See y'all next week. It's not healthy to check prices every 10 mins!

there's some correlation there as the price of the underlying asset should follow, or further out contracts would start dipping.

I mean, that's not true, but ok.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:31:17
No. Whether it's reported or not, every penny is taxable. Don't hit $20k of income on Paypal? Doesn't matter-- you still have an obligation to self-report.

I live in Jersey City, work in NYC. I can't find a single CU that is better than Capital One to make it worth my time to switch with the exception of possibly the Navy Federal Credit Union by way of my brother, but I'd be a bastard member as I'm not military.

Way to be extremely vague..
@_date: 2014-04-10 10:29:45

A paper loss is a loss no matter how you swing it. Yes, a paper loss can turn into profit...but it can also turn into a larger realized loss.

I've looked and I can't find anything worth my time. Capital One (ING) has been pretty awesome in my opinion, so I'm not going to switch to a subpar credit union. My HSBC account can suck my nuts, though.. I keep it open only for a possible mortgage source.

an ETF is an exchange traded fund--- it's a mutual fund that can be traded on the markets. Like a mutual fund typically has stocks as the underlying asset giving it value, a bitcoin etf would have bitcoin has its holdings giving the fund value.

I appreciate that you were trying to gather customers and were giving away free money-- but way to screw up your own promo. I wasted my time for no reason by continually checking. Guess I should have bitched and moaned and wasted your time as well as my own.

You're the one speaking in absolutes. With infinite money and no maximums, the martingale will make the player money.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:31:11
No it doesn't. It only leads to the house winning when there is a maximum bet in place. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 11:44:20
Do you actually think that every single person will lose?
That experiment wouldn't work because there would be multiple wins and more plays than necessary.
If the goal is to win an amount equal to the first bet and you have an infinite bankroll with no maximum bet, you are playing until a definitive end-- your first winning roll. As you continue, the chances of you finally winning a bet approach infinity. You're done once you win a bet. Walk away up 1 initial bet.
