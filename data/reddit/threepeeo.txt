Maybe these guys can help Zane sort it out
However, you need to report through your local affiliated police, e.g. Australian Federal Police,  INTERPOL Washington ,or INTERPOL Beijing’s Sub-Bureau for Hong Kong etc

If your counter party deliberately applies delaying tactics, it is crucial that you focus on the reasons behind the stall tactics and not their behaviour. 
 
Are they trying to wear you down so that you just give up, or is it because they are attempting to make you more pliable? 
 
Always remain emotionally detached and ensure you are not facing a deadline, especially one that is not self imposed. Counter these gambits by advising your counter party you know what they're up to and that it won't work.  
 
You might consider giving them a deadline that is well within your own ultimate deadline.

These "I told you so" responses to these kind of situations is rather callous and presumptuous.
I doubt if many would be using for your first two patronising digs, rather 99.9% would have been cautiously sending funds there to perform exchange, lending or margin operations which are not available elsewhere for the same spread.

POLi always seems so creepy to me. 
With POLi, you are letting a 3rd party stand in the middle between you and your bank for the entire internet banking session - login, account selection and authority to transfer. 
The good thing (if there is one) about these klunky insecure and risky bank services like POLi is that they remind me how much better, honest and more secure bitcoin is than these klunky workarounds....

These guys, as well as the neo-bee scam is the free kick  for someone to step forward and show how it is done properly.  
They have shown the market is there.  It is ready

It is like standing on the beach and trying to fight the tide.

Presently the blockchain is congested and overflowing like a backed up sewer, and it is still pumping around 150-250 tx/min, whilst core appear to be satisfied navel gazing, pondering the universe, segwit and RBF

This "we will make a better blockchain" is the result of Bitcoin's uprising as it appears through the lens of a banker's perception. 
Their rejection of the legitimacy of bitcoin is automatic, as is their expectancy to automatically be seen as an authority in fintech. 
This myopia and subsequent misunderstanding means they fail to see the obvious: 
Bitcoin makes banks' role obsolete in a digital currency world. 
Their "aha moment" in their blockchain labs will be priceless.

the AML issue is convenient, however it does not hold weight - the Australian Banks seem to look the other way when FATF voiced concerns of hundreds of millions of dollars being laundered through Australian Real Estate, which the Australian Government have been "looking at" since 2007!

The banks in Australia are now being investigated by the ACCC, once they bacame too heavy handed. It will be interesting if they are found to be acting unlawfully, hopefully they will then back off.
I was surprised to hear this is also happening in NZ as well - I thought they were much more progressive in fintech than their neighbors.
