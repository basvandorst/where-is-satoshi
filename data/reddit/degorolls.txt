Bitcoins are congealed electricity that have no utility.

LOL. The idiocy on this sub is as boundless as the optimism and naivete.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:10:49
Yeah there will be a 'dip'. It will be like the 'little delay' the Titanic encountered on its maiden voyage.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:38:50
No you can't do that using Bitcoin. You can send him some bits of data, but you can offer no guarantee that those bits of data will be worth $500,000. You can also not provide any guarantee of how long it will take for those bits of data to be transferred. What currency is that by the way? USD? CAD? AUD? 
And let's make this real world. There are probably only thousands of people on the planet who would have a holding of BTC big enough to make that sort of transfer. 
What about a transfer of $120? 
Fees are going to consume a huge chunk of the transfer. By the time, you deposit the fiat, buy the BTC, transfer the BTC, and he sells it for fiat (cos you can't do anything else useful with BTC right now), and then withdraws the fiat, you'll be lucky to effectively transfer $80. And who knows how long it will take. 
This technology is now 9 years old. It is slow. It is insecure. It is expensive. It is incredibly inefficient. Maybe it will change the world one day. But it hasn't got its shit together yet.
OP is right. There are a lot of people who have drunk the kool-aid.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:02:25
9 years since bitcoin came into existence. It's slow, expensive, insecure and incredibly inefficient. 
Cryptos will probably do well over the next 5-10 years. But bitcoin has proven it cannot adapt. Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:37:11
Cool. Will you you be buying the dips?

Yes you have been scammed. 
If you're still holding bitcoin, dump it now! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:27:11
This is the lightning that's been coming for two years now? 
Bitcoin has a market cap of billions of dollars but has been unable to implement a single significant enhancement in 9 years. 
The bitcoin model has demonstrably failed.

Just wanting to understand the psychology of a true believer. 
If there are enough around like you, I might be able to make as much on the way down as I did on the way up. LOL.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:03:43
LOL. That is one of the funniest things I've read today. 
Bitcoin is about as nimble and adaptive as a brontosaurus. It has 9 years and has not adapted to one of the significant challenges it faces. 
It is slow, expensive, insecure and inefficient. 
It is about to be exposed to real market forces and this is going to be ugly.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:17:52
Congested network? No-one is using bitcoin to do anything productive right now and the network is congested and can't handle it... Wow! What a leap-forward this technology is. Nine years old and it still has few practical applications.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:12:26
LOL. Welcome to bitcoin's new internet speed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:22:00
yeah god forbid people try and use bitcoin as a currency. don't they understand the system is not designed for that?
LOL. What a joke this technology is.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:18:47
LOL The economic revolution driven by pot. I think we tried that in the sixties didn't we.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:28
No. That's like implying that the counter-forgery mechanisms built into fiat notes, means that there cannot be any more armed bank robberies. 
There are regular thefts of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. 
One of the reasons we have traditional banks is to be able to amortise the high cost of extensive security measures. The current bitcoin network has woefully inadequate security. 
It is that bad, that Bitcoin Jesus even advises people not to store their Bitcoins on a Windows PC! It is so insecure that one of the most widely used computing platforms on the planet is not a safe place for a bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:12:52

This revolutionary technology takes seven days to settle. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:35:22
No. What is it with this sub? Rather than rebut your criticisms, most people would rather engage in name-calling or finger-pointing?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:00:26
1. In 24 hours we have seen 20% value changes and it's not unusual for a bitcoin transaction to take that long. If I sell you a house for $500K and you believe you're gonna get away with actually giving me $400K you've got rocks in your head.
2. As above. Volatility and confirmation times are extremely relevant.
3. You brought currency into it when you said $500,000. You're a fanboy who's trying to convince everyone that it is a value store but you continue to converse using a fiat value store. Why is that?
4. No you cannot send me any known amount in dollars. That's my point. You can only send me a known amount in bitcoin. And then I cannot do anything practical with it.
5. Congratulations. I perform most of my transfers using fiat for zero fees in around 12 hours.
6. I can't by a coffee with bitcoin. I can't buy a burger or a pair of shoes. Nine years later and its still useless. Stop drinking the kool-aid. The jig is up. This is the endgame for bitcoin - it's over. Other cryptos may evolve from it.
7. Sure the internet is great. But people went nuts with the dotcom bubble thinking they were going to make a quid off the concept of the internet. Most of those companies no longer exist. They were very effective vehicles for separating fools from their money. Today is no different. 
Crypto and blockchain are interesting technologies that will evolve into something useful, I have no doubt. But bitcoin is a dinosaur. The sooner it is consigned to history and we move on, the better off we will be.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:44:16

Bitcoin fails on four counts
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:11:10
What exactly is proven not to be true? 
The practical uses for bitcoin are REDUCING every day. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:23:45
No-one will correct you. This supposedly low-cost and fast technology actually turns out to be extremely slow, unreliable, inefficient and expensive.
That's why the Bitcoin price always crashes after a rally. People actually start trying to use it and discover that the reality is a long way from the hype.
9 years old and the technology runs like crap.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:46:42
LOL. This revolutionary technology is so advanced it cannot even support arbitraging like every other commodity or currency on the planet. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:54:59
Start here and work backwards: 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:04:35
Exactly! I intend to make as much money on the way down as I did on the way up.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:59:46
You will not be able to sell a bitcoin for $15k ever again! 
Bail out now!
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:09:11
No-one owns a million bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:06:23
LOL. You can't buy any of those with bitcoin. You can convert your bitcoin to fiat and buy those things, but bitcoin is useless as a currency.
This 'revolutionary technology' has been around for 9 years and you still can't use it for anything useful.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:51:38
No that's an example. The shitty exchanges getting ripped off for millions are an example.
I think Bitcoin is insecure because security across the entire network is woefully inadequate. That was the case when it was at $1000.  And we haven't even started to see serious investment into theft yet. How much do you think that's going to ramp up with a ten-fold increase in bitcoin's value?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:44:39
When that brain of yours tells you something, you listen goddammit!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:44

LOL. Exactly how long have you been calming yourself with that mantra?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:43:50
LOL. One of the many lies/untruths/deceptions on which Bitcoin is based.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:25:58
In 9 years we have had 5 generations of smart phones. Facebook has dominated the world in 9 years. Google rewrote internet search in less than 9 years.
This is the internet dude. If an idea is good enough it doesn't take 9 years to catch on. Hell bitcoin isn't even close to catching on. 
Bitcoin has not one significant upgrade in 9 years. It is not fit for purpose and never will be.
Crypto has great promise. But bitcoin is dead. 
Myspace was awesome. It helped us discover what social media was. But it is now part of history and little more. Bitcoin will be the same.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:02:44
I was around and bailed out (probably too early but better safe than sorry). I knew it was all over when people started saying we couldn't use the old metrics (PE ratios etc.) to value the "new economy" players. When I started hearing nutters suggesting that we needed to value businesses based on multiples of cash (reserves) they held, I knew it was time to get in the bunker. 
We seem to be here now with Bitcoin. It is slow, expensive, insecure and incredibly inefficient. It is 9 years old and cannot handle, what could only be described as, miniscule transaction volumes. It is impractical for transactional use. The divergent interests of miners, investors, speculators and developers mean that evolution is going to be difficult if not impossible. 
There might be plenty of bubble left. But talk about Bitcoin reaching 100k, 500k or 1m, based on any share of global economic activity is just insanity. It's the 'multiples of cash' lunacy of 2000. 
It's time to deploy the lifeboats.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:45:30
LOL. Yeah you know, the ones you can actual stuff with...
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:48:31
How many people exactly do you expect to buy the concept of decentralized when it is slow, expensive, insecure and inefficient?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:58:11
LOL Early adoption. Pffft!
This thing has been around for 9 years and still doesn't work properly. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:13:53
You're right. It would be the correct use if bitcoin was a currency. 
But it's not what they mean when they use it. And therefore it demonstrates that bitcoin is not a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:40:01
Spot on! 
This ship is going down. But the band here on plays on. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:51:52
LOL. The revolutionary technology that cannot handle a miniscule jump in transaction load.
It is pretty hilarious that you guys can post embarrassing shit like this and still remain bullish about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:54:29
It will grow even though it is slow, expensive, insecure and inefficient?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:05:41
Made money on the way up and I'll make it on the way down.
What is genuinely interesting though is that there are so many people here who get butthurt if you take a skeptical view of their beloved currency. Rather than address the points raised they will second-guess your motives, name-call and generally go straight for ad hominem. This sort of response reminds me more of knuckle-headed religious adherents than than anything else.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:21:44
In the last six months you say? 
Only one of those I've used recently would be Expedia. Exactly what can I buy from Expedia with bitcoin? Certainly wasn't presented as an option for recent flights for me.
In any case, I believe that the few businesses who hang a 'bitcoin welcome here' sign don't actually accept bitcoin -- they just provide an easy way for customers to convert to fiat as part of the checkout process.
This is 9 years later. And the silver bullet (this time its Lightning) is always just around the corner.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:37:17
Glad to hear.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:13:23
How about: the price is falling because a bunch of idiots thought they were going to get rich by buying a digital currency. But it turns out that it is slow, insecure, expensive and incredibly inefficient and the less dim-witted are starting to figure that out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:20:56
So when is this magical day due to happen?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:01:01
What's wrong with fear, uncertainty and doubt? Prefer to stick your head in the sand and pretend that bitcoin works? There are unconfirmed transactions up the wazoo and mega fees being charged. Fiat is looking positively cheap and reliable at this stage.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:02:44
LOL How much did you buy? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:39:37
Yes it definitely can. If you buy now you're practically guaranteed to be having lunch with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, within... oh.... say six months. Pretty exciting times!
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:29:19
LOL. And you are pilot of a money plane that is flying looking for somewhere to land but you can only see a lake of lava, so you descend and use the backdraft from your propeller to cool the molten rock making a perfect runway that you are able to land on and unload your money plane.
Cool metaphor dude!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:08
Which would be the opposite of this sub. When it goes up: fanboy euphoria and circle-jerking. When it goes down: "how 'bout those Mets?"
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:24:46
LOL. The self-delusion in this sub is hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:16:11
LOL. Bitcoin charges more than that for an international transfer and it does it slower and is less secure. By the time you convert from fiat and back again you're miles behind with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:28:23
Get out now! It is a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:44:51
Some exchanges are cheaper than others for a variety of factors. e.g. security and reliability issues means the chance you will lose your money is greater on some exchanges than others. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:08:08
Hey! You probably bought mine. Thanks a million!
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:17:25
For now? FFS. It's had 9 years and the number of outlets that take bitcoin is shrinking faster than my nutsack in a cold swimming pool. 
I rode it up and I'll ride it down. The HODL bounces make this like taking candy from a baby.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:30:39
Awesome currency. Much of the advice here boils down to: "use something other than bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:07:19
Close your eyes and think of Bitcoin Jesus! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:26:01
Impressive response. Thanks I do enjoy and will enjoy my life. But I must say the profits I've cleared in the last week have made it all just a little better.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:58:08
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:40:12
There is nothing you can say to refute this.
Bitcoin has proven itself incapable of handling a miniscule increase in transaction volume over the past few weeks.
What you will get is people now moving the goalposts and telling you that Bitcoin has adapted and it is now a value store, not a currency.
This of course is utter nonsense.
Bitcoin has not pulled off a single significant adaptation in nine years. 
People are in love with the concept and promise of blockchain and they are looking to invest in it. Bitcoin's rise in value will be as fleeting as the dot com boom at the start of the century.
Blockchain may well revolutionise our monetary system. But one thing is certain - it will not be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:27:02
"Stores are rapidly accepting Bitcoin" Really? Tell me all the stores that have started accepting bitcoin in the last 6 months. Now deduct all the stores that have stopped accepting bitcoin in that time. What's the answer?
I can tell you. It's negative. Bitcoin has failed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:36:49
Yes it is bubble. It is an old idea that has proven it is not fit for purpose. But there are a lot people here who believe that bitcoin will keep rising if they can keep luring in new investors to take their money off them. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:41:59
You dont't think the internet has other technologies where a lot of money is on the line but ongoing innovation and adaptation is required? 
Bitcoin struggles because it has such divergent interests: investors, developers, speculators, users and miners. They can't agree on much at all. 
And when they do agree, they are incapable of mustering the requisite development resources to get important shit done. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:01:39
Yes. Just ask any of the mugs that lost their money whether Nicehash was part of the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:19:26
I bailed out at $16k. Healthy profits in the bank. Still looks like we're not even close to exhausting the supply of morons, so I'll probably buy back in later.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:32:48
The level of discussion in this sub is truly pathetic.
It seems that most of the people here, when they hear arguments they don't like, simply resort to calling people idiots and ignore the facts.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:29:02
You're doing it wrong!
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:09:17
Because bitcoin is a failed idea. It cannot cope with miniscule transaction volumes. Seems like a bunch of script kiddies who think they can subvert an entire economic system using wishful thinking. LOL
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:52:02
LOL Really? How much is 12 satoshis worth in USD?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:48:52
What are you 5 years old? "Beat Andreas" This isn't a charisma contest.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:32:45
I'm a rational investor. Struggling to understand the circle-jerking that is going on here and trying to calculate just how much money I can extract from your irrational exuberance.
You should not just HODL bitcon. You should buy the dips as instructed by Bitcoin Jesus.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:11:13
It doesn't. It's slower, less secure, more expensive and far less efficient.
What we have with bitcoin is a crowd of people thinking they are smart and going to make money from a technology that has repeatedly failed over 9 years.
Stick to your fiat currency and existing banking system for now and come back in 10 years when this shit has evolved.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:19:20
Calling someone a troll does not answer the question I posed. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:40:27
What the fuck has BCash got to do with anything that was being said?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:40:40
Very good advice.
It is too slow, expensive, insecure and inefficient to ever be a currency. Probably not viable as a value store either.
But still the scammers on this sub repeat the mindless HODL nonsense.

@_date: 2017-12-10 21:07:01
Proves my point. The 'millions' is a reference to fiat currency - not bitcoin.
