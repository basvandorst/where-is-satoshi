The put it as down 42% over the year because IT WAS DOWN 42% OVER THE YEAR. You're suggesting they "cook the books" by putting a + in front of that 42?

Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
This I tell you brother
You can't have one without the other
Love and marriage, love and marriage
It's an institute you can't disparage
Ask the local gentry 
And they will say it's elementary
Try, try, try to separate them
It's an illusion 
Try, try, try, and you will only come
To this conclusion
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother
You can't have one without the other
-Frank Sinatra

User name with hightimes in it. In Mexico. Dealing with what can be called "iffy" finances. The IRS digging into your financials. You're scared that they may dig deeper and find other shady things. Concerned about lawyer/client privilege. 
It just begs the question. What Mexican drug cartel do you work for?

Why are people assuming he used Bitcoin to buy the car? He simply said his new plates arrived. And OP has been asked a few times if it was bought with Bitcoin, with no answer. All from a 12 hour old account. That doesn't raise suspicion?

Would you prefer "theft of intellectual property"?
