I believe it's 6 confirmations for both bitcoin and bch, but coinbase requires 12 for bch.

It could go down, it could also just keep going up. Don't risk not having any, but no need to buy all at once. Dollar cost average in. Buy the dips.

Full tweet:  1/4 [~~  are a novel layer two protocol, designed for off-chain Bitcoin  transfer. It is facilitated by a multisig federation which never has  complete control, making it non-custodial. 
 It integrates seamlessly with the Lightning Network, allowing the  opening/rebalancing/closing of channels to occur off-chain via  Statechains, making on-boarding onto Lightning instant, and allowing you  to swap participants in and out of channel factories. 
 Privacy is also enhanced. UTXOs can be swapped atomically, allowing for  the equivalent of off-chain coinjoin. Blind Signatures make the  federation completely unaware of what they are signing. They can’t even  see whether their activity has anything to do with Bitcoin! 
This and more becomes possible off-chain – Discreet Log Contracts,  cross-chain atomic swaps (a "DEX"), transfer of non-fungible RGB tokens,  etc!

Seems simple enough. Also doubles as a demon summoning circle.

While a tx fee will be higher than bch, if bitpay implemented segwit, it wouldn't be nearly as high. But they are shit so im not surprised.

Bitcoin dumping dirty fiat.

BTCpay server, open source 
 An alternative is Opennode. it's not open source but an easy top set up POS  for onchain or lightning transactions

CashApp and Abra on iOS or Android. Abra currently has the advantages that you own your private keys, and you can deposit BTC to the app (cant with CashApp). Both services are better alternatives to Conbase.

No, you would first need to move the funds to the wallet with a bip39 seed. Then that bip39 seed is able to be restored by any other wallet. You should restore your electrum seed with an electrum wallet, I believe.

To clarify.. this title is a bit confusing.  The article states that Brazilian crypto markets combined traded 100,000 bitcoin in a 24 hour period, a record for the most traded in 24 hours in South America.
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:33:06
This. Don't trust coinbase. CashApp and Abra are better choices that are just as easy to use.

Peter is a hero. This is something that must happen. Craig can once and for all be proven a fraud in a court of law. And we can help him fund the defense. It takes balls, and Peter has those balls.

My absurdly high $0.5 fee (or whatever the average is today)  is offset by the fact that my bitcoin has appreciated 1000's of % since I acquired them.

Don't worry about it. I've been trying to tell my closest friends and family for years. Bitcoin going to 20k didn't change their minds. I continue to be friends with them but rarely bring up bitcoin to them anymore. It's their choice, and I'm not going to waste my time trying to help them anymore. If you constantly try to force this down people's throats it will just ruin relationships, not to mention it sounds shady. At this point I rather they forget I even hold bitcoin honestly.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:25:26
True. I edited post with another alternative, Abra. You keep your private keys and can transfer out.
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:02:02
Use CashApp
Edit: Abra is another good app for buying and selling
Edit2: Abra allows you to keep your private keys, and deposit coins, things CashApp does not do at the moment.

Not too familiar with Robinhood, but it's likely you do not actually own the bitcoin you bought through them, as you wouldn't be able to withdraw them to a wallet you control. I believe they only allow the purchase and sale through their app. You would need to cash out, and purchase the bitcoin elsewhere (cashapp, abra,etc) and then withdraw to your own wallet. And you will need to pay taxes on capital gains (if you sell bitcoin at a profit).

Selling 10% at 50k, then 100k, 150k, 300k, 500k, 1mil then rebuying as it dips between the sales. In time I'll be able to stop selling.

Sounds like bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-28 07:20:31
This is fine except for keeping any on the exchanges. You don't own what is on an exchange.

When it gets closer to 20k you know it will skyrocket past ath easy, so why sell there when 30k, 40k, or 50k are weeks away?
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:43:58
Between 61 to 100 should get through eventually. The mempool clears on weekends usually. Switch from blockchain.info ASAP so you don't have to pay as high fees. Look for a segwit wallet. BRD wallet, samourai wallet, mycellium. On desktop, electrum.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:21:34
Don't sell what you can't afford to miss out on.

@_date: 2019-05-30 10:35:50
Yes, you would need to create a new wallet which supports segwit. Trezor , ColdCard or Ledger + Electrum, for example, and move your funds. Many mobile wallets also support segwit, if you want to hold some in a hot wallet. Main advantage is cheaper fees.
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:26:38
We need to demand that these services integrate segwit. Look for alternatives to those who don't. It's up to us to pressure them to upgrade. Vote with your bitcoin.

It's basically an exchange. You can buy or sell in person. They also carry trezor wallets, i believe.
