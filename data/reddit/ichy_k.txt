This is an interesting development from Amun, who only released the underlying index (HOLD5) in September. This is an interesting institutional product which should attract serious AUM.
I'll be following closely the progress of sales, distribution and performance. I would say that the SwissBorg SB20 index is far superior than the Amun Index.
A few initial observations:
* This is an ETP, **NOT** an ETF as lazily reported by many news outlets
* An ETP is a collateralised debt security, not a fund
* Investor is exposed to the credit risk of Amun AG (the "Issuer")
* The Issuer is not regulated
* The Issuer is 100% owned by the Amun Technologies Limited (the "Index Sponsor")
* The Board of the Issuer is majority controlled by employees/founders of the Index Sponsor. The 3rd director is linked to MCO Monaco
* Institutional product - not for retail distribution (in EEA)
* The Issuer "intends" to use proceeds from the sale of products to buy for the underlying components for collateral AND for general corporate purposes - No definition of "general corporate purposes".
* Products aim to be 100% collateralised, however due to price changes this may not be possible (also costs will be taken from realisation of assets - so would likely to be less than 100% anyway)
* In event of default of Issuer, investors are ranked 4th in priority
* Custody of collateral is from Kingdom Trust Company (the "Custodian") through a multi layer, multi authenticator, cold storage security platform
* Custodian owns the wallet private keys
* UCITS eligible (although approval by UCITS member regulator)
* This is a passive investment, Amun do not provide active management
* Redemptions are limited, an investor has right to redeem on an annual basis (upto 60 days notice required)
* Daily liquidity through SIX not guaranteed
* annual management fee: 2.5%
* ETP provides exposure to the HOLDL5 index; a basket of crypto assets
* Delta 1 synthetic exposure through put options
* the underlying index, HOLD5, is maintained by MVIS , a VanEck company
* Index components are 5 of the top 7 eligible crypto assets, based on market cap (top 3 plus 2 of next 4)
* Index components are essentially BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP, LTC, XLM, EOS,
* rebalanced monthly
* min/ max weighting: 3%/50%
* Index eligibility criteria includes :
   * \&gt;$1b market cap (30 days)
   * \&gt;$25m daily volume (30 days)
   * no stable or privacy coins
   * existed for more than 12 months
   * trades &gt; 33% of circulating supply (30 days)

Totally. Lazy reporting. This is an interesting product. However I believe there are better and more diversified crypto indexes to invest in.

Its not an ETF!

Its an ETP, not an ETF. It is collateralised with an aim to be 90% collateralised by crypto.

An ETF is a collective investment scheme, i.e. the investor owns shares/units of the underlying. An ETP in the instance of the Amun ETP, has exposure to the Issuer, where the return is based on a basket of crypto/ index. The risk profiles of both are very different.

I acknowledge the conversation has moved on somewhat from your above post, however it is worth noting that the SEC  issued a consultation paper last week in relation to the VanEck ETF. 
There maybe further tweaks to the legal and operational structure of the ETF, however this appears a very positive move and suggests that this is being given serious consideration by the SEC.
