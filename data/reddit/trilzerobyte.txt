Yes. I haven't done it yet, but the signature generated by the Opendime (each time it's powered on) can be used to calculate the public key. That's all you need to create any script you want, including multisig or timelocks.

How many inputs (individual transactions received) did it need to combine to send your transaction? Each input raises the size of your tx and increases the fee.

As bitcoin price rises, eventually it will be more valuable than the electricity produced, and the electricity cost will rise in terms of bitcoin, which lowers the relative price of bitcoin.  Replace electricity with any other good, and you will see bitcoin price can't rise indefinitely.

You can think of bitcoin locked in a Lightning channel as a checking account that requires 2 signatures to withdraw from. Every bitcoin address actually has a script that has to run to determine whether the bitcoin can move; in 2-of-2 multisignature it just means you both have to agree.

don't trust stop loss orders. Depending on your exchange, they will execute as a market sell, and during a crash, the liquidity will decrease, so you may end up selling at a much lower price than you want.  Also don't count on being able to log in and press the sell button, during high traffic times the logins may be unavailable.  If you want to take a profit, decide on a proportion of your coins, send that to the exchange and sell it.

Rootstock is a sidechain, so while its transactions don't need to hit the main chain, that will only be useful for smart contract ones. Otherwise you would expect to need to move your RSK to Bitcoin to spend.
What you are looking for is Lightning Network, if you have a channel with someone and there's a route with sufficient liquidity, you can instantly send to/from the exchange with no need of the blockchain.

Generally people talk their book; in other words, those saying it will crash, probably don't have any (or are spreading FUD in order to buy in cheap). Because they believe that it will crash, they don't buy.  Asking here you will likely get the opposite, people who say it will always go up (because they own Bitcoins or because they are trying to drive up the price and sell).  Due to this effect, you will never get an accurate prediction simply by asking.  You'd do better to check out some Technical Analysis (looking at chart patterns, trend lines, moving averages, etc.) and/or Fundamental Analysis (understanding the market, risks, long-term benefits, major players, competitors, etc.).  
To answer the specific question: Yes, there will be crashes and usually they are staged to scare new investors into selling low.  If you sell a little bit when it's high you will probably be less likely to do that.  
The other question: Bitcoin is not a scam. It's a free and open source software project where you can inspect the code and decide whether to run that code or not: either you agree with the network rules (fixed inflation schedule, capped total supply, the mechanism of proof of work to distribute coins and secure the network, open for anyone to join and use), or you don't.  In this sense bitcoin itself will not crash as long as 2 people still use it, and the Internet remains up.  The software doesn't care about the exchange price.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:37:38
Even if you break ECDSA, you'd only get private keys from public keys that are known (normally public keys not published until bitcoins are spent).  For addresses that are only used once, you'd still have to reverse RIPE-MD160 and SHA-256, since addresses are a hash of a hash of the public key.  Having multiple private keys known to be from the same deterministic wallet may allow you to derive the seed though
I think you need to go back to the FAQ though. Wouldn't building a solution for every possible curve point be more work than counting to 2^256-1, which would take billions of years?
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:09:09
Sure, you can send RSK to someone.  But they have to choose to accept it... it's backed by bitcoin, so its value tracks bitcoins, and it can be redeemed for bitcoin as long as enough RSK federation nodes are up, but that doesn't mean everyone will automatically recognize the actual RSK token in stores, exchanges, etc.  I expect them to setup Lightning support on the RSK side so you'll be able to send the RSK back and forth with Bitcoin without needing to wait for peg-ins and peg-outs.

I don't know what store this is, but this answer applies to any general Point of Sale.  If someone makes a payment that is close to the amount requested, but under, it will not be accepted - meaning you will have the funds, but your store will not notify you, so you would not normally deliver the product. The customer would need to contact you and ask you to check the actual wallet and transaction to see if you received it, issue a refund, or tell them how much more to send.  But if you set this value to a non-zero number, in theory, customers could underpay and get marked as paid, which in theory could cost you money.

Satoshi's whitepaper covers this in quite simple terms, check it out: Https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
Basically miners burn energy competing to extend the blockchain and whoever wins gets to decide which transactions get accepted. Each full node validates blocks and chooses the valid one with the most energy burned (proof of work). In this way anyone can transact with anyone without a central validator.

Talk to your escrow agent, you will also not want them to send the BTC back since that will cost a miner's fee and reduce your capital further. You will want to find if your escrow can accept Lightning and try getting some Lightning from a faucet or a loan from someone to pay the difference.  Since the difference is lower than the miner fee anyway they might just mark the payment completed manually.
EDIT: miner fees are based on the size of transaction in bytes, this is why you can't send a transaction for a small number of satoshis, with a normal fee you are paying 1 sat/byte and a normal size of around 200 bytes.

The truth is I don't know of any places to loan out bitcoins currently and would be interested to learn about them if only to add to bookmarks.
What I'm saying is that in the long run, you're likely to make more (lose less) by simply hodling than by risking loaning out.  For an introduction to this idea, check out The Correct Strategy of Bitcoin Entrepreneurship, by Daniel Krawisz, accessible at  and if that's interesting, also "Everyone's a Scammer" on the same site.

Congratulations! You are using bitcoin as a store of value.  Now, to use it as a unit of account, simply track your bitcoin balance as bitcoin units and try not to think of it in terms of how many dollars they're worth, it's just a decimal number that doesn't change and represents an immutable claim on future use of the censorship-resistant ledger called the blockchain.
Then the final function of money, a medium of exchange: which also tests your wallet, that you make a small purchase or donation, which will give you first hand knowledge of how addresses and signing works.

Lightning Network uses Bitcoin as its token natively. If you think Lightning will enhance Bitcoin, you can just buy bitcoins.
You could run a hub and charge lightning relay fees or loan bitcoin to someone who does. But that's not the same as shares in Lightning, there are none.

Without LN you still have off chain tx, but with no fallback to the blockchain. All sites that take btc deposits should transition to become hubs. Instant, trustless transactions should not be underestimated.
Now, the new roles in LN are hubs, lightning wallets, and outsourced monitors. A LN wallet is a hot wallet. It has to be online. The peer has to be online to update channel state. You will either monitor your channel or outsource it, because if the peer broadcasts an old state you have a certain time to claim all the funds in the channel. Outsourcing this trustlessly will be possible, thanks to non-malleability which came with SegWit.
Sidechains: I expect most major sidechains to be merge-mined. Merge-mining allows miners to mine both chains at once.

They already know you are the one who sent the coins. If they didn't send the transaction yet, I'd tell them it's to yourself so they will send it.  If your tx confirmed, you'll still have BTC but they'll keep bugging you so I recommend telling them anyway, then stop using them at your discretion.  You already chose to use a regulated institution so you need to deal with it until you stop doing so.

Write down all of the following and keep it safe. Maybe someday you, or someone, can reconstruct the random state with help of your 3 paper wallet keys and recover the coins. All this info can narrow down the search space because it was part of the input to the random generator (securerandom.js):
Exact version of bitaddress
Time and date and timezone you generated the keys
Exact browser version, plugins installed, language, OS
Screen resolution
URL used (website url or file:// url)
I don't know how practical this would be, but consider it should become easier over time, and coins may become more valuable until it's worth doing.

Take a deep breath. Draw the last few years of price on a logarithmic scale. We bounced off the bottom of the channel. If you are going to trade, use some basis for decisions.  There's money to be made selling at top of the channel and buying at the bottom, but it's high risk and you have to pay attention.

The idea of voting seems problematic; individuals can already donate directly. If you want crowdfunding where the payment gets refunded if not enough people donate, see 
A more serious problem would be that a wallet is typically stored on the user's drive and they have no incentive to pay you as the wallet developer
Now if you setup a website where you provide a hub for lightning channels, and integrate a directory of charities and merchants, that would be pretty useful. Since you could then take fee from the lightning transactions. Keep in mind that legally, routing a transaction may constitute money transmission in your jurisdiction.

The bank isn't afraid of your business being risky to you. They're afraid their compliance officer won't understand how to do the job and their whole license gets suspended.  Unfortunately, if you want to do business with the established system, partner with someone like Coinbase or maybe Abra or Xapo, I dunno who in the UK, they will have VC backing, so the banks will accept them.

You may need to create an outbound channel first, before other nodes can find you to create an inbound channel. This is because with 0 channels, your node public key doesn't actually propagate through the gossip network, as a node without a channel has no use.
EDIT: Or create a peer connection to the node that is going to open a channel to you. Some liquidity nodes will support opening a channel to you over your existing connection, and some won't.

Bitcoin provides just one example of the truth that as knowledge and technology increase, the circumference of the boundary between what we know and what we don't know becomes longer.  So more new things become available. The idea of building a closed system to control the users (such as the legacy banking system) becomes more ridiculous (or anachronistic) as time goes on.  New inventions can completely run circles around all such systems.  A literal encirclement.  And as you have seen, Bitcoin enables an entirely new set of systems based on itself, so there's no end to possibilities.  This has implications for the inevitability of human freedom.  You have to choose to be free.  No one forces you. Bitcoin provides a voluntary choice such that it connects those who choose to use it. It does so in a way that no one objecting to the arrangement has any say in the matter.  And it does so natively to the Internet which means it feeds into the technological singularity (which began with the Von Neumann architecture computer), increasing exponential growth of possibilities on the Internet as well.

People often miss this one: Digital goods. Information, files, online services, and any automatic vending machine. Bitcoin is a store of value that can be automatically, independently verified (accepted) by a computer program (that reads the blockchain).
Even physical vending can be more secure with Bitcoin: goods can be dispensed when Bitcoin are received at a cold storage wallet at a distant location; no cash goes in the machine.

We are in a hype cycle. Negative news is ignored and not spread due to news manipulation or greed.
Consider: much of the value going into Bitcoin is for Onecoin. Eventually Onecoin will collapse. How many of the early Onecoiners will keep their proceeds in Bitcoin?
China has completely stopped deposits and withdrawals. Many USD based exchanges have fiat transfer issues. These are currently dwarfed by increased volume from Japan, but for how long?
No one is talking about the extra bitcoins that may have gone to miners using covert ASICBoost to their advantage (which still is not prevented).
The market currently acts like these are minor issues compared to Bitcoin's future potential.  That may or may not be true. Markets can run away... The real reason for the price to move is to take funds from new inexperienced traders. This is our 5th bubble starting?   It's necessary to think critically and not let emotions determine your buying and selling. Keep a level head and set goals for yourself and stick to them. I recommend getting involved in ways other than just investing funds. Run a node, write code or a blog, take part in meetups, podcasts, trade goods and services peer to peer, and then the price can be a fun and profitable diversion but not the entire reason for being here. When it goes down (and it will), you'll A) not be broke and B) not panic since you'll know there is real value and can make a rational decision whether and how much to sell.

Mostly because they have high time preference.  They have responsibilities, they are barely able to pay bills, believe they need to spend a lot of time at their job and keep doing what they are doing (only a whole lot more of it) in order to keep up and someday get a little bit ahead.  They have a distant goal and believe they are reaching toward it.  The idea of stopping and taking a break to spend a little time to learn about Bitcoin is antithesis to their entire mode of life.  They feel they will get overwhelmed because Bitcoin is a very deep subject and they would never have time to learn it completely and keep their current life.  People don't like change.  They would rather continue to work hard and get no raise for years because that is what they have done and it's worked for them.
Also, those who economically don't understand that Bitcoin is likely to grow and gradually take over economic activity, tend not to think of things as a whole system. They don't follow concepts to their logical conclusion by saying "If everyone did this, then..." because they think of these things as useless and too unrelated to their life.  It will never affect their ability to go home, play some random clicker game or watch a sporting event or Netflix, whatever they do to unwind.  And they don't have time to think about it.  Because they don't think things through, they only have the word of what they read on the Internet, or what their friends tell them to go on.  And if they get contradictory signals then they throw their hands up and say, well, we'll see what everyone else does over time.  They will switch to Bitcoin when their bills start to charge bitcoin, and reject dollars; until then, they think it's a joke or an Internet play money.
They are also not programmers so they see no benefit to a currency that can be automatically verified by a software program. They don't understand how the Internet developed and why, or personal computers, so they can't imagine that in a very short time, exponential growth of technology could mean robots and software agents using Bitcoin could be the only way anything is done.  OR they don't care.

If you have any backups of the wallet, they will likely be fine. If it's a legacy randomly-generated wallet then the change was sent to one of the 100 keys pregenerated and stored in that wallet. If it's a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet (that Bitcoin-qt has been generating recently), the change was sent to the next change address in sequence from the original seed.  Either way relax and wait for your blocks to catch up.

Yes. The balance is calculated by going through every block and adding up all the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to addresses in your wallet. This is the point of running a full node: you independently verify your received payments without trusting a third party. The cost is as you have seen, needing to keep synched.
