death spiral is something bcash supporter use to define a moment when btc price keep going down and bch price keep going up.
They fail to see that price is not dependant to hashing power but it's the other way around. Price depends on demand/offer and trust that people put in the coin.
About sudden hash power changes... it's a problem right now because btc happens to be more popular and more transactions are required.
1-2 years ago, even if hashrate dropped to 10% it was not a problem for the network. Even if there was 1 block every 2 hours it was not a problem beacuse there was not a massive amount of requests.
Now it's different if the hashrate drop. 
we have to wait for Lightning Network that will relieve a lot of pressure. LN tests are around 90% done and we have to hope for the best.

yes indeed hard times are coming.
But if btc can go through all this it's gonna consolidate its lead massively.
Jimmy Song said that LN development/test is 90% done.
Last month it was 65%.

Yes I agree with you.
Yes it is a problem if they leave all togheter, when I wrote the post I was thinking about a long term scenario where miners leave slowly over time. If it happens in one day for a specific reason it can leave a big congestion if the network is not prepared for that event.

Yes you can just wait and hold.
These are hard times for bitcoin, no one will grant you that it will go up without first going down.
Long term, 1 or 2 years, bitcoin will probably be worth much more than now, but it will be a journey with many up and downs.
Expect more forks and attack on bitcoins next year.
