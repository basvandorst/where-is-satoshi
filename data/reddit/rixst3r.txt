I like this, great site.  I'd love to start accepting Bitcoin for my products.  I wish it were easier for merchants like myself who do a lot of transactions and don't have time to manually verify everything...  It's been a while since I looked into the options, I keep waiting for a payment module for my existing e-commerce platform to show up, but it hasn't so far that I have seen.

Seems to me like possible bitcoin foundation players, who created tether, moving coins around to have the funds to back up minting a fresh new batch of 100M tether...  don’t they have to have assets to back up the tether they print?  The numbers seem to line up...

The bitcoins were put in safe wallets with care; in hopes that sum-bch would soon be there.

Best of luck to you, open a Columbus branch and I will stop by.

Wow.   The man himself.   Two questions I’m sure everyone wants to know:
How should I get started in bitcoin? 
Will you send me some?

Also assuming this post isn’t just a joke, but I recently helped with a benefit dinner to build out a facility to house and rehabilitate girls who are being rescued from sex trafficking.  They only got a small percentage of what was needed.  If you are for real...  it’s a worthy cause.

The rockets in the photo are actually *landing* ... they are going *down*  ... Space X.   Bitcoin hopefully is not also rocketing down.
