Just to see how it feels.
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:27:37
The reason probably is because h0us keeps posting exactly this comment in many threads.  It's great advice, but yeah.  It's getting a little annoying.  
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:10:19
That bytes.
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:38:37
Yes and no. Depends on your goals. Maybe check the Sidebar for more deets.

I thought that if you put in an order it time stamps with the current price at the time of the transaction.  So even if it takes a while, you still get the price that you bought at.  Have I misunderstood?

Buy a little now, then some more later, then more after that.

To be fair, none of them really seemed to know what they were talking about. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:24:36
Or anyone else’s for that matter
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:23:39
No clue

RIP thumbs.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:08:17
Top sheet is $3200 i think
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:17:56
Same.  But also at 2200 and 2000.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:17:53
More like 3.50
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:56:54
So I guess we should just starve for a few weeks then ?  Or do you have some insider info on a smaller yet promising mom and pop chain I should be eating at?  if so please share.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:16:48
How about buy some now.  Then buy some more if it goes lower.  Then buy more if it goes lower still.  And so on.  
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:32:09
Ah.  Well I was kinda hoping to secure my BTC before aug 1st but I don't really feel like paying the amazon / middleman tax...  maybe I'll leave my coin in coinbase and just wait for the store to restock their wallets.  See what happens...
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:30:26
Bummer.  That shit should be illegal...
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:16:42
Use a camp fire.  Stoves and oil suck.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:47:53

@_date: 2017-06-20 23:45:18
