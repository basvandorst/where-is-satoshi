I remember the days when BitDice clogged up the blockchain with betting 'dust'.  Same idea, less kitties.

This feels like the runup to $1600 for me though.  I was in the Gox death like you, I got my japanese class-action lawsuit plaintiff notification.. I've seen things, man... But this just feels like any other bubble.

[Bitcoinity](//bitcoinity.org/markets) is great, gifs for milestones (back when they were manageable, like last week...) 
It's a great low-weight ticker.

Buy and hold.
"But the price is going down!"
Hold, young one.
"But it's TANKING FROM $15 to $4!!!!!"
"But it's dropping from $1200 to $400!"
HODL GODDAMNYOU

Sunday night whales.. never fail. Since the days of Gox Sunday night's always been a dropper.

Who would be so audacious!? They'd never suspect such a dumb move.

Crash is great for margin-shorters.
The enemy is stability in that case.

Not for stolen credit cards, where chargebacks are not for disputes.
'Chargeback' covers fraud and disputes.

I think I'd have offered to bring an assayer on-site at her expense to shave and weigh the gold to pay for the sandwich, plus a convenience fee for me for the trouble...

I think what is saying is it's suboptimal.  Come on,  man, can't you see!? IT'S NOT OPTIMAL! He must take on risk for extreme efficiency in his perfect worldview!

That may be so, but it erodes the writer's credibility.

/shrug. I temper my excitement with BTC. I remember when we got to nearly 1200 and it was 130 the next day.  
Be fearful when people are greedy, greedy when people are fearful.

True, but you plan for the things you can't imagine.  I'm just dollar cost averaging now.

Agreed 10k in two years but with very large drops in between.  I suspect a 2k BTC sometime soon.  I've been a hodler since 2014 but I've seen this boom bust cycle before.
