Here we go again. The BLOCKCHAIN is awesome but bitcoin sucks!
When people write these posts do they have any idea how the blockchain even works?, have they ever "mined" a crypto?
Here it is - a token "bitcoin" is created as a reward for verifying transactions, NOBODY will verifiy transactions without a reward, if transactions are not verified, the blockchain will stop.
A bank may create a blockchain and run it on a server in a back room somewhere, and they would be mining it alone, but guess what, they would still be rewarded a "token" for the mining. But it would be a centralized system and have no value beyond there own internal use. The decentralized nature of the verification and reward feature is what makes bitcoin work. Bitcoin is not an app on top of the blockchain, it is integral to its function.

Unbelievable, who would have guessed r/bitcoin could be so generous.
@_date: 2014-11-08 00:23:43
Now that is content worth tipping.
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:06:27
PLEASE make it clear that the currency bitcoin can not be separated from the blockchain. This idea is spreading around and it needs to stop. Your videos are awesome by the way. I wish we could make a huge internet billboard shouting! YOU CANNOT HAVE THE BLOCKCHAIN WITHOUT THE CURRENCY.
That's my rant. Thanks

Wow thanks! That is very generous
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:21:21
It's simple really, bitcoin "the currency" is the reward "incentive" for the miners to verify the blockchain transactions, no reward, no verification, And hence no blockchain, the whole thing would grind to a stop.
Would you expect your accountant to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for free. Also, it takes expensive resources to "mine" and verify the blockchain in the form of electricity and hardware, this must be compensated for.

Mind blown!

It's taken a while but the realization is setting in that tipping internet content easily and generously is the long awaited killer app in my opinion. This is after all internet money, also I bet most tips will not be converted to fiat but rather used to pay for other content or re-tipping.

OK another charity that's wants all our information before we can donate. PUT YOUR BITCOIN QR CODE on your front page so I can donate anonymously and move on. I would love to donate, and generously but not if I have to fill out these bloody forms!
Do you want my generous donation or my personal information?

Here have another 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-06 23:02:20
After seeing what's going on over here today, the tipping culture of doge may be spreading
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:04:14
No way, I'm humbled, that's like 12,000 dogecoins!
@_date: 2015-01-25 12:07:59
I remember some rumours last summer about coinbase adding litecoin and dogecoin eventually.
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:52:25
The rocket is going to blast off and plant 2 more flags on the moon, guess which 2
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:47:55
sure here is 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-20 21:24:12
So I give them my private key and I'm supposed to just trust they will not keep it. I don't think so. But nice product.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:00:24
Make that into an app and allow a contact list and It would be awesome!
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:32:42
Can I buy them with Bitcoin or dogecoin?
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:27:30
They are legit - I've used them many times, no issues.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:26:04
Very well done, clearest Bitcoin primer I've seen yet.
