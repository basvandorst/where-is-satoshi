The two sides aren't so evenly balanced, sorry. BU are a bunch of fact-resistant fanatics.

What? Accepted by who? Do you think that exchanges would accept a chain that has a different coin limit instead of 21 million just because it has more PoW than the normal chain? I don't think you understand how this works...

I thought that was a fun bit of comedy by luke-jr (a pr to change the work function). However, it does expose that Bitcoin Classic is may have an even more centralized governance model than Core. Food for thought.

You make it sound like those *new people* are nice innocent participants who are just trying do their thing, if only those bad would stop being mean!
The reality is that they're a well-financed group that wants to *take control of the reference client* so that they can implement a wildly radical form of consensus called "emergent consensus," something that critics are warning will lead to an unstable network that will regularly fork into incompatible chains. 
This is an extremely serious problem, one that you can't blithely dismiss as merely two sides squabbling over a trivial issue. It's a battle for the heart and soul of Bitcoin.

He loves to criticize the Core devs for just not understanding economics, as if he knows any better, and arrogantly presuming that none of the Core devs has a background in economics.

Yes I agree it's about egos and vindictiveness. Roger Ver can't let this go because his feelings were hurt, and same with Jihan Wu. It's pitiful.

Because he has his ear to the ground on happenings in Bitcoin. Are we supposed to not listen to him because you disagree with him?

You're reducing a complex and serious issue to a strawman.

Why do the r/btc people refuse to understand this?! How the hell can completely ignorant comment get so many upvotes? Just incredible.
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:36:33
Yep they want control.

He still thinks that it's doomed. Naysayers will be saying that even when the price passes $10k.
