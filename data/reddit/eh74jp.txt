It's fiction. They didn't mine any.

Fidor Bank to Kraken is instant. Because Kraken's bank account is with Fidor.

Because it makes you a smaller target.

It'll go below $10k, for sure. But it'll take a while and you'll have forgotten about this post when it does.

At least six months of bear market ahead, I reckon.
Things will start looking rosy again in September.

Deflation wouldn't remain 5% forever. An equilibrium would eventually be achieved. The economy would find the right balance between people saving, and people spending to build.

Is your bank account with Fidor?

Yes, it's SEPA. Within the same bank so instead of overnight it goes through straight away. "Instant" is probably the wrong word, in my experience it takes somewhere between 30 seconds and three minutes. Quicker than a Litecoin confirmation, but slower than Ripple.

Enjoy your car. Your coins will go to someone who'll take better care of them.

What does "hurt the economy" even mean? That McDonalds annual revenue decreases? Not necessarily a bad thing. That jobs dry up? That'll never happen. People will make their own jobs. Humans have an innate desire to build and progress. Not everyone, many individuals are lazy. But the collective, in general, will always strive for a better life, and that means actively building the economy.

It's 4 coins, plus 1 settings app. So 5 apps. Yes, this caught me out as well.
The work around for now is to install and uninstall the extra apps as you need them. The coins remain on the device even when the app it uninstalled.
In future they say their apps are going to re-use more code libraries, so this will save space and allow for more apps.

Not if it's empty, which it probably is.

This has nothing to do with segwit.

I'm in Munich and am a fairly regular attendee of these meetups, and I absolutely do not agree with this statement. Nor do others from the group who I know in person. Of course not even my post here will be published though.
