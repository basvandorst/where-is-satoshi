One world government, run by peaceful consensus on a blockchain.   All wealth in bitcoin.   Right?
Where do you get your weed from?

I usually charge for my advice and predictions, but just this once I really want to help the community.
From my free prediction service: We will be in the range $7.5K to $8.5K for the next few months.   $7K at the end of summer and then down from there.    Please trade and invest accordingly!

No matter if it goes down to $1.   Bitcoin is not about price in crappy government-issued fiat.  It is about power and control taken from governments and banks and given to the people.   And decentralization and anonymity.   Right, boys?
1 BTC = 1 BTC !

Why are you so worked up that people are doing as they please with their money?   Besides, how do you know they are noobs doing the selling?   If you want to hodl, that's fine.   But understand that some people like to take their profits from time to time.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:02:56
Just keep hodling.   Next year it will be 100K per BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:03:19
Quite true.  There seems to be very little new money coming in.   Most, but not all of course, of the transactions seem to be people who are already in buying and selling to each other.    
The hodlers keep saying "look at the past!", which is not going to work after the painful losses.

keep faith in the tech.  in a few years you will be a millionaire.

Why do you consider them idiots?   Maybe they bought lower and are now cashing out at a profit.  Even, if not, and they are taking a loss, why get so upset at other people making their own financial decisions?  SO what if they later buy at 50K?

Money is one of the most important things that a government controls.   And quite rightly so.   The idea that any government, let alone world governments, will give up that control in favor of some fuzzy internet product is extremely naive and show serious delusion in some places.    
On top of that bitcoin is nearly useless as a currency: very few places take it (the ones that claim to simply directly convert into fiat) and hardly anybody uses it for anything, whence the excitement that brings people here to report that "I just bought a T-shirt with bitcoin!".    Further, 99.9999999% of the populace see little that bitcoin can offer then over traditional banking.   They are interested in loans, mortgages, easily paying for goods and services, credit-card protections on purchases, etc.    "Decentralized", "anonymous", etc. meaning little to them.
What bitcoin does allow is the opportunity to participate in a lottery in which there can be many winners.   Of course, as in any lottery, the prizes come from the contributions of the other participants. So, in a sense, those who claim that there is wealth distribution taking place are right, but in a rather perverse way.

Too much gloom here.   First thing to remember is that this thing will only keep going up, and eventually we will win because we are the early adopters.  Like Apple or the Internet or something that in the 1980s.  We just have to wait until it's the world currency, like Thiel has predicted.
Second thing to remember is that even if we never make any money, it doesn't matter, because we are in it for the tech.  And freedom, fighting governments, banks, and so on.   Providing anonymity and control over one's own money.    We are the vanguard of a revolution such as the world have never seen.
So, even if it sinks to $1 per BTC, we still win!

1 BTC = 1 BTC !
Never forget!    Forget bogus fiat pricing!
