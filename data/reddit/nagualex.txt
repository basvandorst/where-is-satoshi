There's also Deckbound, who I think has been in development for a longer time and is closer to release. The developer even released the smart asset stack he uses for the game.

Does that mean a mod deliberately censored this post, rather than this being an automated thing due to people downvoting? I feel like I was rather fair and not just bashing or pumping this or that other project. This really sucks.

I like that you can use it to still do chargebacks in case you get scammed by a vendor. Granted, you have to pay, and you'll have to justify that chargeback and deal with insurance, but at least it's an option. This is like a condom for online payments.

I like you. You have to admit I went easy. I didn't talk about Satoshi's satoshi stash or the core devs' foot thing.

I did not delete it! How is it appearing on your side? :(

The virtual card looks very interesting. Has anybody had experience with this company before?

You mean he is a rational, balanced human being that does not feel like he is at war with the universe?

Yeah even when logged in I can not see it in the submission queue anymore. Shucks. Didn't the mods delete the Ethereum posts, while giving a pass to all the Greece drama?

Good to know. Thanks!

Fair enough. You're right, it's a bit obscure, and there are maybe better examples for people to relate to, but to me Bitcoin is a lot like the Minitel even in terms of bandwidth, features, etc... It feels a lot like the early Internet as well. Lots of hacking, tinkering, and a shared sense of freedom, discovery, and awe.

So, if I pay the 0.0001 fee, is there a way to still prevent the transaction from being mined? Like, nodes are OK enough with it to relay it, but miners won't bother with mining it in a block?

Funny how one of Bitcoin's killer apps is a plastic Mastercard.

Yes. 
Put the registration at the end of the process.

Fair enough. However, configuration really should be kept to a minimum "sensory overload" for the person using OB for the first time.
Right now, there is a sensory overload of opaque questions with no sense of movement or development.
Perhaps you could just splash to the main screen straight away with place holder products (banana, comic book, etc... make it look a bit cute/nice), but as soon as a user clicks on anything, the relevant configuration panel pops up?
Just to give the user a little "taste" before having to deal with anything, as well as trickling down the configuration panels rather than setting up everything at once.

Cheers. I'm thinking, isn't there room for a node to node communication system? Even just a basic ping would be useful to verify connection and distance. Pinging directly over IP address would just bypass the flood network, it wouldn't tell you how the data is doing in the actual bitcoin network. I want to constrain the communication to go through the Bitcoin nodes
