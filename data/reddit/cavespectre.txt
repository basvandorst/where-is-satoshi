Transfer it from coinbase to gdax  (which is free) then transfer from gdax out (also free)

It goes as a loss for 2018 (the year you closed the position).  It will serve to offset gains as well  (So if you have a $30 gain it will balance and end up $0)
However there is a limit to how much you can write off in losses a year (the remainder rolls over to the next year)

About the same time they realize that cheap beer is worse than expensive beer.  But sometimes they never learn.

Could you have transferred it to gdax?  What does the transaction history show?
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:58:41
Well gdax is part of coinbase and they have free transfers.  Also check gemini... they have 10 free transfers a month.

Sending from one exchange to another shouldn't be a taxable event since you didn't trade the coin. The transfer fee should be based on the value of the coins from the exchange you withdrew from.

I do get a masochistic kick out of the different statements from the different departments of the government and how some consider it property, some consider it a security; whatever makes it be something they can preside over.
But in general even with it as property (as the IRS seems to treat it), it's the same as if you made a bunch of barter trades to turn a pencil into a car... each increase in value is a taxable gain.

Good to know.  USAA never ceases to impress.

Transfer it to gdax and then withdraw from gdax instead of coinbase directly.

When you put a limit order in, you set the price you are willing to buy  (or sell) at.  This is what is entered into that order book.  When you put the limit order in you will see a notation where your order is in the book.  Using limits is basically a "maker".
A "taker" is buying or selling at a price that fits with the book.  So if they do a market order for X coins, the lowest selling price will fill the order and if that doesn't have enough coins, it will fill those coins and then move up to the next selling price to fill the remaining coins (so on so forth)
You can transfer your balances from coinbase to gdax very simply... including the fiat you have on coinbase.

Not exactly. If you bought $100 worth of bitcoin, and your account is $500, and you sell 20% of your holding; your "cost" is the cost of the 20% you sold.
So for example, if you bought .025 Bitcoin for $100, and you sold 0.005 Bitcoin for $100:
.005 Bitcoin: Cost: $20, Proceeds $100, Realized Gain $80
So the amount that's taxable is the "$80" gain; leaving you with .02 Bitcoin; Cost Basis $80, Unrealized Gain $320.  
Now if you sell again within a year, that next gain is taxable.  If you sell after a year since you purchased it; it's long term gains instead of short term gains.
(Now to really mix it up... if you trade that remaining bitcoin for litecoin; that's a realized taxable event on the value of the bitcoin, less the cost basis, at the point of the trade)

No maker fee (If you use a limit order to create a "bid" price in the order book); it's a 0.25% fee if you "take" an ask price.

They both have free trials; I tried cointracking.info; which would manage up to 100 trades for free.  I was able to get what I needed to understand from it (thus knowing to look up the USD value of the base coin used in any trade at the time of the trade and recording it into my records), and once I understood that, i maintain my own tool in excel.
Depending on your technical savvy, your history and your level of giving a shit, you may chose to use one of those tools, or look for a more robust (or less free) one.

Anyone thinking anyplace where you don't own the private key isn't thinking of the big picture.  Anyone that played online poker knows about Black Friday and many lost money when access from US players was just shut off.  Hearing about China cracking down on cryptocurrency raises even more red flags for me.  The amount of money in crypto stored outside of your own control is way higher than was online poker.
... what happens when the website you hold your coins at gets shut down?  I'm not worried so much about my coins getting hacked and stolen... I'm more worried about losing access when governments and the financial and money brokers and come in and start to fight.

Yea it's a bit of a hassle; but there is some software out there (bitcoin.tax or cointracking.info ) that can help you catch up or manage it.  I used those to get re-familiar with the practice (I used to run a business that took some payment in Euro so I'm at least familiar with recording the value at time of transaction).  Now I just record what the USD value of whatever currency was at the time of the transaction; and programmed in that recording into my bots so that I have a record of it to generate my gains from.

Don't forget to not be distracted by the discount and take a look at the item that's 20% off and make sure it's not junk that shouldn't be sold at 80% off.

The first thing I figured out 10 years ago when i spent a year day trading...  all the graphs explaining it look great once it has played out.  However if you cover up half of that graph and look at the view when you should have bought, or when you should have sold.
 It looks a lot different then when the pattern has finished playing out and you find a plethora of cases where that real time view is virtually identical to many other places that didn't end up finishing the pattern.
Quite simply... when you enter into technical analysis pay bery very close attention to the point that many ignore:  
the invalidation exit signals.

Yea.  Sign up on gdax and it's a free deposit from coinbase (same company)  then withdraw to your wallet from gdax.

Pretty much a sell limit above the highest buy limit will be a "maker" order...  providing a big buy doesn't come in while you are placing the order and push the buys above your limit.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:06:52
Yea.  Basically unless you are buying straight from a fiat upload... transacting on coinbase rather than gdax is a waste of money.

Basically you can buy a contract to buy at a certain price. So for example, you can buy a contract to buy btc at 10k, or 15k, or 20k.  Those contracts expire at a certain date.  These contracts may have intrinsic value.  So if btc is at 16k, the intrinsic value of 10k contracts is 6k.  15k contracts is 1k, 20k contracts have no intrinsic value.
Then comes time premium.  Time premium is based on how long until the contract expires and the volatility of the underlying security.  Therefore the 10k contracts may have 1k time premium, the 15k contracts may have a 1.5k premium and the 20k contracts have a 1k premium.
So the end result of the 10k contracts would cost 7k (intrinsic plus time).  The 15k contracts cost 2.5k and the 20k contracts cost 1k.
So... if you have 10k contracts that you paid 7k you make money when the value at expiration is 17k.  For the 15k contracts. 18.5k.  For 20k contracts they are profitable at 21k.
So you might ask why 20k contracts?  Well if you bought the 10k contract for 7k and the price goes to 25k, you make 8k.  But if you bought 7 of the 20k contracts for 1k each (same amount) and the price goes to 25k.. you make 4k times 7, so for the same price you made 28k.  But with greater risk.  If the price goes to 19k then you lose 14k from the 20k contract (the 7k you paid plus the 7k premium since you have to fill the contract at the higher price) where you would  make 500 from the 15k contract or 2k from the 10k contract.
That's the buy side of the bull contracts.  Sell side is you writing the contract for someone to buy.  Bear contracts are the other side... buying and selling the right to sell rather than buy.
Hopefully that helps the basic concept
