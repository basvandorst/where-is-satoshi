Why is that? Any good reason? I want to hold for years when I get my hands in bitcoins

So you don’t recommend me, a 17 year old boy to invest? Putting like a 100 dollars here and there after periods of time

Hello everyone,
I hope everyone is doing fine. Anyways, for quite a while I have been trying to convince my father to invest in bitcoin   (Ever since a year ago) but started nagging him in the 2700 dip. But ever since that dip, he keeps on saying these following things:
-bitcoin will die
- I am more experienced than you 
- bitcoin is a scam and will rob everyone in the long run 
-governments don’t support bitcoin 
I have tried and tried to convince him but he keeps pulling the I am more experienced than you (am 17 years old). I cannot invest much on my own since I do not have a lot of money and I am spending the money on various things (ilets, sat, etc) . How can I convince him to spend in bitcoin? 
P.s. this is my first post and I have been wondering if there will be a major dip nearby so I can invest with my own money. 
Thank you for your time!

How much is your current profit? I know it’s different depending on when you invest but I am just curious. I cannot get a steady job right now before going to uni after my senior year (this year), I might work part time and invest a little bit.

Any tips on what I should invest? Like a guide or anything? Or your personal opinion?
I am just a 17 year old student looking to maximize my revenue in the future

How low will it dip? I need to know for my first purchase

Why not? Is it wrong that I want to invest in BTC when I can know I could put in less money (don’t have much). I know it’s unpredictable but I want to know when it’s expected to stop dipping

Thank you for your insight, but may I ask what do you mean exactly by resistance?

Is it guaranteed that there will be a dip?

Chill, I didn’t offend you in anyway. Everyone starts somewhere and don’t expect them to know everything. And I am looking to gain “profit” for the future in times where I really need the money, and if you are going to “lecture” someone in the Internet, do it properly.

Guys when should I buy bitcoin, now or wait for a dip?
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:57:05
What do you mean going to dump, can you clarify please? I want to make my first purchase (been wanting to purchase over 9 months but I kept on forgetting and just got a safe wallet)
