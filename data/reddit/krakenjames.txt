Hello [corneliul](
Thank you for choosing Kraken as your no.1 cryptocurrency exchange!
The Websockets Public API service enables faster and easier access to Kraken’s market data.
The main advantage is that market data will quickly stream to clients with no polling required. Clients simply use the API to establish a durable, low latency connection with Kraken’s servers, then the servers will push the market data incrementally to clients as soon as an update is available.
The websockets protocol provides the best foundation to stream real-time data and build trading applications. Kraken’s websockets public API is just the first phase of a much larger project that will bring many cutting edge services to Kraken clients!
In case you require any further assistance or you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us by opening a support ticket or via Live Chat [here](
Warm Regards,
Kraken Client Engagement
