Maybe im missing aomething but in the small chance there is a reversal of the shitty economy and the same notes are used later on, why get rid of it?

For clarification, I just got a ledger nano s and the figure on the right is the total increase in balance for the last month, with the percentage of increase in my portfolio being the figure on the right. Just figured I'd explain for the context in case anybody isn't familiar with the ledger live interface.

You are full of shit. Everyone thinks whatever they want about bitcoin but the only truth is speculation and fomo drives it up then sell offs occur. Anyone else putting a numerical prediction on it is full of fucking shit.

I was just talking with my dad about how the current price of Bitcoin is literally the output of an epic war going on for humanity's future.
