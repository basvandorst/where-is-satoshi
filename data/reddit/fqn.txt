True, I guess it does all add up.

What... How are you spending $1200 per month in Chiang Mai? Are you living in a hotel?

Whoa, you pay more than $1,200 USD per month for your apartment in Chiang Mai? That must be an absolutely amazing place. I visited an apartment in Chiang Mai that was only $700, but it was on par with a $6000 1 BR apartment in San Francisco. Fully furnished, amazing view, huge swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi, gym, etc.

This is why Bitcoin crashed last time. It's why it's about to crash again.

Honestly I still think they're pretty boring and dumb, except now they're worth a lot of money. You probably made the right choice based on the information you had at the time.

Hehe, 67 is not an early retirement, it's 2 years after retirement age. Otherwise, congratulations!

Ok how much do you have then? Enough to retire?

This is great, thanks for this post. I'm working on a mobile app (not related to Bitcoin), where I was seriously considering Google Translate for a first pass. I didn't understand why my cofounder thought it was such a bad idea (his native language is Swedish.) He must have had similar experiences to you.

You can send coins to a timelock address so that it's impossible to make any transaction for 5 years. You can set the date here: 
You could also set up a multisig address and give one key to your SO or your parents. That might be better, because you can still access the money if there's an emergency.

You joke, but I think a large number of subscribers are very wealthy right now. There's probably at least 1,000 millionaires in here, if not 10,000.

How many of you fuckers are millionaires now?
Goddamnit.
