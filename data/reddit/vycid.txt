But so what? If the ASICs are only 1% more efficient, and therefore only 1% cheaper than buying a shitload of servers with traditional CPUs, does this matter at all?
The fact is, a big player can run a server farm more cheaply than the little guy. That will be a much bigger factor than the difference in hardware cost if the PoW is ASIC-resistant. So, really, the important thing is making sure that either:
1) It doesn't make financial sense to mine with anything other than idle cycles
2) The total amount of idle hashpower will remain substantially larger than the farmed hashpower at the point where the profit from adding any additional farms reaches zero.

So, like collectible coins, a bitcoin is only valuable to collectors for its collectible value, and not as currency, since any altcoin can function as currency and altcoins 
aren't scarce?
I'm gonna help you out, because you're reiterating things that don't matter. Cryptocoins aren't the scarce quantity,  because copies can be made. What is scarce is units of account on networks with many peers. Bitcoin happens to be the biggest network, but if gets totally eclipsed by something better in the future, it won't be worth shit but for its collectible value (which will be very small compared to current value).
In any event, if other networks gain peers - and they will, inevitably - Bitcoin will lose market share. The question is to what degree this will happen, because that will determine the degree to which a bitcoin becomes replaceable and thus the degree to which the 21M limit doesn't matter.

No. That's ridiculous. The "ASIC" in the situation we have described is a computer processor with the things that make it valuable to the mass market stripped out. Except those things are the cheapest to add, from an engineering perspective (communication buses, etc).
You are suggesting that the Bitcoin ASIC companies will be able to produce a better product than Intel, without recouping the engineering costs by selling to the mass market.


I disagree. The number of people who will be arsed to set their computers to mine bitcoins will depend strongly on the profit resulting from doing so - there will always be some people who aren't mining bitcoins. If the point at which people stop bothering to switch over is still highly profitable for the ASIC guys, that's when there's a problem.
But we're unlikely to see that point if CPUs are nearly as efficient, considering how much it'd cost to set up a mining rig if it required, at a minimum, a modern processor and DRAM.

Three methods, depending on derivative/security type: 
1) exchange 1 creation unit of ETF for corresponding number of bitcoins
2) sell ETF shares/bitcoin futures on the open market, use proceeds to buy "real" Bitcoins
3) Take delivery of the futures contract at maturity
I suspect you are only aware of method 2). If 2) was indeed the only process,  you would expect the prices of paper and "real" bitcoin to differ, but 1) and 3) serve as the control mechanism to keep them in alignment and enable 2).
Even without an ETF, Bitcoin futures contracts are sufficient to inflate the "supply" of bitcoins. Since all extant futures contracts will never simultaneously mature (nor will most people request delivery), it is a stable and unending game of musical chairs.
The gold markets (the COMEX in particular) work similarly and I do not expect Bitcoin will be somehow immune.

This is largely because Linux has fewer users and, as a result, fewer people trying to exploit security loopholes. Fewer eyeballs gives the appearance of fewer flaws. (The other reason is that the user permission structure used to be insane for Windows, though that has been largely fixed since Vista. UNIX was always sane.)
Back when OSX was a tiny part of the market share, Apple used to boast how it was immune to viruses. Then their market share picked up - and what do you know! Viruses.

You'd have two options: buy them slowly (you'd get the market price averaged over a long period), or buy enough mining hashpower that you'd get the majority of new coins being mined.
Since miners aren't going to take a loss, that method also ensures you get market price.

Hold on, that doesn't add up. Gold mining DOES create new money, or it doesn't? 
If there's no new money creation in the game, it's much harder work for new players to get any, compared to the loaded players who were there for a cut on day 1.
That's exacerbated by deflation,  because it becomes even HARDER to move the balance of wealth away from older players, as their buying power naturally increases - even then not considering the fact items aren't destroyed.
In the real world, people might join Bitcoin after the initial stage because there is still an asset (USD) it is appreciating rapidly against. In a video game they're gonna want an economical model that doesn't enslave them to Day 1 players, or they'll choose a different game.

Yes, but you are getting carried away with the abstraction. If Bitcoin completely displaced the dollar, it would *still* be a stretch for it to make sense to spend 10 billion dollars a year on R&amp;D - like Intel does - in order to produce a product that *must* be used to mine Bitcoins. Feasibility therefore demands that the small edge in the performance to cost ratio over mainstream hardware must compensate for the R&amp;D expense.
M0 in the US is currently about 3.91 Trillion USD. The bitcoin supply is increasing at roughly 11% a year, so that's $430 billion a year.
So something like a 2.5% increase in cost performance must be realized  merely to break even, ignoring startup costs, practical difficulties, block halvings, and the fact that Bitcoin is never going to totally displace the dollar - certainly not before the block reward has halved many times.
2.5% is probably achievable. But in practice it is possible to create an ASIC-resistant chip, because the abstraction requires a market the size of government fiat.

This is almost unequivocally a bad thing.
1) Trust prevents a frictionless market. You may continue to patronize a merchant with an interior product if you have established more trust with them than their competition. 
2) Bitcoin is fundamentally about not having to trust *anyone*. That is the whole point of the blockchain. Suggesting we just shop at merchants we trust undoes all of that.
There will be natural trust asymmetry when you exchange Bitcoin for the "promise" of a good delivered later, but we should fight hard to limit that asymmetry.

You can equivalently say that "The only way to force someone to use a CPU is to use "run an arbitrary hashing function" as the PoW". That doesn't sound so bad - it wouldn't be greatly complicated. You'd just need a very large library of hashing functions. The tradeoff, potentially, is the cryptographic security of each hash function.


Erm, no - it simply stops making economic sense to use ASICs to mine bitcoins, because the cost per ASIC-mined bitcoin is greater than the market price for bitcoins which have been mined by the idle cycles of millions of CPUs.
Alternatively, you can look at it simply that the advantage granted to the bigger players is negligible, because the ASICs they're manufacturing are barely discernible from CPUs.

Where it says "used in the future to create wealth", it's talking about cashflow in generic terms. Instead of dollars, perhaps it's heads of cattle. It still will have a dollar value.
In finance, appreciation is itself linked to the productive potential (monetized as cashflow) of the asset. When homes increase in price, at least one of two things has happened:
1) Rent has increased
2) Expectations of future rents have increased
Considering that art, collectors' items, etc do not have productive potential but may be expected to appreciate, I cannot say that the definition does not fit, but I *can* say that Google's definition for it fits much more appropriately:




And in any case, you have no idea what my history or perception of Bitcoin is. I was short on ASICMiner shares back in 2013... And ASICMiner shares *were* an investment. They were just wildly overpriced.

Okay, let's suppose you're a business. In an inflationary market, people are encouraged to spend money because holding on to it is disincentivized (your money will be worth less later). So the inflation encourages people to buy, helps you sell more stuff, and you grow as a result.
It is well established that inflationary markets experience more economic boom years and less recession.
Deflation, on the other hand, makes people NOT want to spend. So if you're a business, people will be incentivized NOT to buy your stuff, because their money will be worth more later if they don't buy. On an economic scale this is bad. 
The economic impact of deflation on the economy is much larger than the impact on your wallet because your money is worth a lot more each year.
If you want your investment to be worth more, the solution is simple. Trade your money (which is subject to inflation) for stocks (which are not) in companies that will grow as a result of the inflationary environment.
Demanding that *money* be the thing that is worth more year-over-year is a rookie mistake in economics. Being too lazy to buy stocks is your fault, not a failure of the currency. The unit of exchange should always be inflationary. There's always gold and silver if you don't want to buy stocks.

Any time someone says "stocks don't have intrinsic value" it sets off a "you don't have a job" alarm, too. Yeah, that company that has never failed to cut you your paycheck? It has no intrinsic value. 
Better opt out of the stock purchase plan.
**PS:** These companies could all easily switch to Bitcoin and keep doing business (with a few exceptions like Visa). 
Their intrinsic value is independent of the dollar. If the dollar has no intrinsic value, then bonds have no intrinsic value; but companies produce *real goods*, and real goods *define* intrinsic value.

Who said anything about years? If I'd been mining for years I'd be a millionaire. The lifespan for ASICs is going to be less than 6 months, so that should be the benchmark.


~ 6 mo, Litecoin/Bitcoin hybrid strategy based on market, intensity 18/9 typical LTC/BTC, run below 80C and avoid thermal cycling, and achieve pretty damn near 100% uptime.


Yes, it is. There will be a market glut of miners (since there are literally tens of millions on preorder), ensuring a difficulty increase to the edge of profitability. Further, the electricity costs vary by region. Hashrate will concentrate in places where electricity costs $0.02/kW and mining will become unprofitable everywhere else.


They ARE faster and more efficient, which is why tens of millions of dollars worth of them are about to get deployed, destroying the competitive advantage.




I have literally done the math. I have goodness-of-fit analyses for exponential and double exponential growth models for hashrate, the corresponding IRR models for various ASIC products... you name it, I've done the math.
Did you think I had all those numbers for ASIC investment for no reason?

But I think you are stuck in the gold paradigm. Bitcoin does not track gold, like silver does. Bitcoin appears to be acting like its own asset class apart from the precious metals.
And that actually doesn't surprise me. Gold (and silver) trade on fear and pessimism - war? financial meltdown? - gold goes up. Bitcoin, on the other hand, trades on optimistic speculation about its future as a currency.
Basically, Bitcoin is surrounded by a community of optimistic investors who set its price - not pessimists seeking a haven for their money. So it's no surprise that Bitcoin doesn't track gold.
But you can be assured gold will be up come Monday.

Strictly speaking both of these things are true.

Bitcoin does not have any such assurances. For most of its history it was worth vastly less than it is now.

Bitcoin is more valuable to select individuals than gift cards or arcade tokens, but its value to the average person is comparable. Thus the comparison.

This *is* pretty cynical. It's true that the government does have its own purposes for anonymous transactions, I won't argue with that, but couldn't they accomplish that electronically?
As for HSBC vs Liberty Reserve: HSBC *DID NOT* get a pass. They were fined billions of dollars.
The reasons that nobody at HSBC *went to jail* (different from "getting a pass") was twofold. One, because there was no criminal intent. It was negligence: they failed to notice when their system was being used for money laundering, as opposed to the maliciously designed system at Liberty Reserve. Two, because it'd be nearly impossible to determine which individuals at a huge company like HSBC were actually the negligent parties. You can't send a whole company to jail, and if the CEO didn't actually say "be negligent", it's actually not his fault.

Big Bang Theory's audience is mostly people who are not technically literate. The show is essentially about laughing at nerds - part of its popularity comes from soothing any insecurity the average viewer might have about "not being smart".
From that perspective, BBT has little incentive to tackle *actual* topics in geek culture. They want "nerdy-sounding" topics that are relatable to the average viewer. The show itself is only superficially technical. It's hard to make fun of something if the show is rubbing the fact that you don't understand it in your face.
So I expect that BBT will not do a show making fun of Bitcoin until it's already in the public consciousness. Otherwise the audience goes, "What the hell is Bitcoin?"

This is precisely why I envision a future where BTC exists as an alternative to fiat, just like gold. It will perhaps be used to cut down on fees and exchange rate hassles in international business-to-business transactions - which are many, these days, since the economy has become so global - but beyond that it will be primarily a store of value, not a currency. Borrowing and spending will be done in local fiat currency.

You're not getting it. Anything that presents exclusively one side of the argument is inherently intellectually dishonest. It's like saying,

1. He revitalized the economy
2. Restored hope to many Germans
3. He built the autobahn
If you're talking to someone that doesn't know anything about Hitler, you're being fucking dishonest. If the person already DOES know about Hitler, you're wasting your time. Get it now?


Lol. Sorta like how yours is full of redundancies and exaggerations.
But okey doke. Here's an excerpt from something I wrote earlier.
1. Incredibly risky to use; if your coins are stolen you have no recourse
2. No motivation for the average consumer to adopt it, since they don't pay credit card fees, and have to learn how to keep their coins safe; this alone is enough for the average person to NOT use it
3. Blockchain bloat is already getting out of control and could never support tens of millions (let alone billions) of people
4. Governments could start ASIC projects to kill the blockchain (*easily*, they just don't care yet)
Now it's my turn to tear yours apart.
1) Lower transaction costs for businesses.
This is only an advantage over credit cards. What about competitors like Ripple? What makes it better than that?
2) Lack of the middle man.
Why is this a *good thing*? People that pay for stuff with Bitcoins often *pay people money* to act as escrow (middle men).
3) No fraud or charge-back (from a seller/business PoV).
See  The lack of a charge-back mechanism means you have to pay for some kind of escrow, or risk being scammed.
4) Immunity to inflation due to decentralisation.
What??? Decentralization has nothing to do with inflation. If we found a mine with a trillion dollars of gold in it, gold would experience inflation. Gold isn't centralized either.
You realize there's about 10M Bitcoins in existence, and about 1M are currently being created every year, right? That's a 10% increase in the money supply, more than 3 times the rate of the US dollar!
Furthermore, in the future when the mining rate slows down, Bitcoin will be *deflationary* - the value of a unit of currency will increase, not decrease. Almost every modern economist agrees this is bad, because it encourages people not to spend their money.
This is a con, not a pro.
5) Decentralisation.
This is only a pro if you distrust central banks. It's a fairly good argument, though.
6) Centralisation (lack of).
This is exactly the same thing as 5).
7) Open Source.
There are downsides to this, too. Being open source makes it easier to hack, although it makes it easier to make it hard to hack, too. Decent pro.
8) Natural deflationary cycle.
See 4). This is a bad thing.
9) Transparency.
Some people actually like having private transactions. Cash is much less traceable than bitcoin, since every transaction is posted on the blockchain.
10) Transportability.
So are dollar bank accounts, bearer bonds and money orders.
11) Transferability.
Yes. It is cheap and easy money to anyone without paying wiring fees. Solid pro.
12) Anonymous if you so choose and put in the effort.
Sorta. If the government was motivated to put in the effort, they could probably track you down, unless you took some dramatic steps like having someone else buy coins for you in person.
You could argue there are downsides to this, too, since it helps terrorists and cartels.
13) Lower vendor costs (for consumers).
Can you provide evidence of this?
14) Easier to use than Credit Card or Western Union, or Money Gram, etc.
TOTAL bullshit. Are you kidding me? You have to download a 5 GB blockchain, learn how Bitcoin works, move your money through sketchy services to Mt. Gox, keep your computer secure, etc etc etc. This is a downright falsehood.

AGAIN? NOT a pro. Same as 4) and 8).
16) It is up to THE PEOPLE (you, me, everyone) as to whether Bitcoin succeeds and brings about the changes noted above (and possibly others I’ve missed). Upon business adoption, inspires people adoption, means growth for businesses that have adopted, means jobs, means eventually governments will have to adopt for tax reasons, means transparency.
This isn't a pro. It's up to the people whether cow poop becomes currency, too.

Between the recent government shutdown (which coincided with the arrest) and the fact that the FBI isn't a news organization I do not find it odd at all.
The (tech-savvy) public was perhaps interested to know that SR was taken down. We all know that is true, the site is gone.
What happened to the fellow named "Ross Ulbricht" is of interest essentially only to ex-SR users, conspiracy theorists, and the Bitcoin community. There's no good reason for the media to be covering it extensively. When there's an $80M drug bust it's usually in the news only briefly.

Similarly the USD is the reserve currency not because anyone said so (regardless of whether or not they did) but because commodities like oil are denominated in the USD, because forex trade is usually done with a USD basis, and because international trade is conducted primarily with the USD.

You are, of course, guilty of making your own assumptions about what people want. Some people - probably the majority, unfortunately - like the security of autocratic government and would not much appreciate your efforts to take that away from them, regardless of implications of Stockholm syndrome.
I am sure hardcore statists are also perfectly capable of ranting about how you damage the system with your "grass is greener" delusions.
I am amused by your insinuations, considering that I am an outspoken critic of bloated government and that I am perfectly aware of the games governments play. The recent Syrian conflict was not about chemical weapons; the US could hardly give a fuck about some Syrians getting gassed.
No, that was a chance to get a natural gas pipeline finally finished in Syria so that Europe could finally get cheap natgas and out from under Russia's thumb.
But ultimately that is still nations acting in the interest of their citizens - just in a cold, calculating way that wouldn't sell politically. So they spin it (Human rights! Geneva protocol!) to make it palatable to the public. Of course Russia stepped in to defend their interests...
All of that said - none of this is inherently evil. We would be getting constantly fucked by foreign powers if our government was not pragmatic enough to play the game.
Even as you rail against the "unbridled evil" and "brainwashing" that your government represents, I am certain you hypocritcally enjoy all the material wealth its machinations have made possible, and the comparative freedom of thought and expression that you enjoy, not having been militarily subjugated by an autocratic foreign power for lack of a military.

What's the alternative, though? Governments form spontaneously, too. Getting rid of the government has ALWAYS, in the history of civilization, resulted in a new one.

Guys, don't be stupid. This isn't at all similar to conflict of interest in Fiat monetary policy because *there is no monetary policy for Bitcoin*. It was all laid out at the genesis block how many coins there would be, and when they'd be mined. Nobody controls the money supply, certainly not the Bitcoin Foundation.
And this, this is bullshit:




What the *actual* fuck? Do you guys actually believe this? Gavin is taking a lower salary than he could get elsewhere because he believes in Bitcoin and wants to help out.

Yes! That's right, because Bitcoin is a new invention, and people believe it's worth something, it has *created a billion dollars of wealth*! (edit: this is the approximate Bitcoin market cap) 
Pretty cool, huh? But as soon as it starts being used *instead of dollars*, dollars become worth less. The value comes from somewhere.
And when it's used as the de-facto means of exchange, people will hoard bitcoins, and it'd be similar to people hoarding dollars in the current economy (bad).
My point is this: deflationary currencies are bad for the economy, certainly worse than modestly inflationary ones. Bitcoin is deflationary. Do the math.

Lol. I run a mining op. You're just drunk on kool-aid. I think crypto is the future, but I don't think it's going to be Bitcoin.


You know as well as I do this community downvotes anything that questions the Holy Bitcoin.


You have misunderstood. The government doesn't need ASICMiner or Avalon or BFL.
(By the way, I work in the semiconductor industry, so I am somewhat an authority on this sort of thing.)
1. The government contracts with a big design house (say, Intel or AMD), to design a powerful, cutting-edge 22 nm SHA-256 ASIC chip. This would be probably 20 times faster than the crappy chips Avalon and ASICMiner have pushed out so far, which use technology over a decade old. This will obviously require money - more money than Avalon or ASICMiner have, but chump change for a government.
2. Then, they go to a big chipmaker like TSMC, and have them produce say a million units. No sweat - TSMC produces billions of chips a year.
3. At this point the network is *fucked*, understand? The government controls 90%+ of the hash rate, if they want. They double spend up billions of coins and send them to random addresses previously used in the blockchain. It'd be chaos.


I have a suspicion you're the one who doesn't really understand. The current block size is  capped at 1 MB, which isn't so bad. Scale it up to maybe ten million people using it every day for mundane transactions - gas, groceries, and a night out - and we're looking easily at 10 MB. Scale it up to a billion and we're well over a GB per block.
You say computers will catch up? When do you suppose the average miner is going to have storage that can handle an additional 100 MB per minute? That gets *expensive*, fast. A year of blockchain would be over 100 terabytes, and we'd have years and years of backlog. This is happening *now*, not in 50 years.
And how is the INTERNET going to handle millions of miners communicating 1 GB blocks every 10 minutes?


Even if you were right that moore's law will scale for another 20-30 years (it won't, I assure you, physics is about to get in the way), we'd be waiting for 20-30 years before Bitcoin would actually make sense.
BTW, I do remember EXACTLY what happened to netscape, how a bigger company with more money came around and fucked it over (hey, that sorta sounds like the 51% attack thing I described!). I also remember Napster, and Friendster, and Webvan (lol).
The first thing is not always the best. Get your head out of the sand and take a real, honest look at Bitcoin. It has some very valuable qualities, but it *also has a lot of problems*. If you can't see that, I'm sorry.

It's incredibly easy to look up the firstbits on the blockchain and validate the coin is funded and real before purchase. If you're using a service like eBay, you have protection that the pictures represent the item being sold (i.e., that the firstbits in the picture are the firstbits on the coin, and the balance remains intact upon assumption of ownership). And making a counterfeit hologram is waaaay beyond the technique described here... I don't think anyone has claimed they can do that.
Coin databases:
For my part, I am getting my Series 1 coin ANACS graded and sealed. It will have a grading date on it, which will verify its authenticity 10 or 20 years from now.
If the price of these coins really does drop over a security panic, I will vulture up some more of them.

That's right. However, it does not take much mental effort to construct a scenario in which *someone else* has been using Dwolla/Gox in the execution of some scheme that harms other people.
Some bureaucrat at DHS, knowing nothing about Bitcoin, made the incompetent decision to shut down one account that Dwolla is associated with to stop the legitimately harmful behavior (notice how they shut down neither Gox nor Dwolla, just an account). This is, I hope, a temporary mistake until they recognize the size of their error. It's standard practice to freeze accounts associated with criminal activity until the investigation is complete.
I'm not really sure I understand your alarmism, though. Yes, Dwolla is obligated to comply with the court order, in the same way that your landlord would be obligated not to evict you tomorrow without due process. Laws aren't much good unless there's somebody with a stick to make sure people take them seriously.

I own a few dozen Bitcoins, sure, because if Bitcoin is the future, that's the least I can get away with investing. But delusions about the odds seem pervasive around here; I think the people with half their life savings in Bitcoin are crazy.

The reason Bitcoin was created (note: this is not the same as the reason it exists) was to provide an alternative to, and perhaps precipitate the downfall of, state-dominated economies.
This DOES NOT imply any incompatibility between the founding motives of Bitcoin and traditional economies. In fact, things like fractional banking should be recognized as valuable because the growth and creation of wealth by providing the capital needed to enable industry and trade.
We would still need some sort of loan/banking system even if everyone in the world left fiat behind for Bitcoin, or things would get really, really shitty. How would you buy a new house, or a new car? How would development companies fund their construction projects, and how would car companies pay for new manufacturing plants?

It's actually different this time (speaking as a semiconductor engineer here) because we're hitting a limitation of physics, not process capability. 16 nanometers (the next process node) is ~40 silicon atoms across, total. Much smaller and the tunneling current - again, a fundamental part of quantum mechanics - will overwhelm.
There's just a physical size limit, and we will hit it soon. After that the only progress will come from more efficient chip design, which will definitely not be exponential growth.

From a few posts back,


You can coordinate multiple *small* communities. I haven't been arguing anything else.
The point is that these small communities lack sufficient resources to enable the kind of technology we are used to today.


The reason for this thesis comes down to a number of well-established theories by anthropologists that egalitarian behavior in humans can only exist in groups of a few hundred. Human "bands" of up to a few hundred have been documented, but they never grow any larger without the addition of central authority (elders, a chief, whatever - it's proto-government).
There are some psychological explanations for this behavior. One of the theories with the widest acceptance involves the fact that humans can only "know" (in a personal sense) a few hundred people. Beyond that the empathy goes away, and with it, the egalitarianism.
So to answer your question: egalitarian communities must be small, because humans are naturally programmed to compete for resources with anyone outside their extended family.

As we discussed the war was to preserve the Union, not to free the slaves.
The North did aid (former) slaves, but primarily because their government's laws specified they should not be forcibly deported, and because there were a minority of sympathizers that would go out of their way to offer aid.

What a sophisticated argument.
The reality is that I cannot explain economics to you in a few paragraphs. You've learned a tiny amount about it and decided that you're an expert, and that you know best. That can't be helped.
It's not a matter of extremes. It's not that "deflationary currencies will stop people from spending altogether!!!1". It's that deflationary currencies will *negatively impact* spending, and that will negatively impact real economic growth.
Inflationary, government-issued fiat currencies are important and are not going away. Bitcoin, too, is not going away; it is a revolutionary, frictionless payment system.
I am looking forward to a world in which the Bitcoin protocol has replaced credit cards, banking and loans are still denominated in dollars, speculators keep wealth in gold, silver, and bitcoins, and we are both filthy rich.

That's because we haven't yet invented the necessary hardware and software to make it easy to keep bitcoins safe. I imagine it would also be hard to keep silver secure if locks weren't invented yet.
Besides, most people, even those that do not secure their bitcoins, will not be stolen from. That's the nature of news - you hear about the horror stories the most. Just because you're watching a news item about someone who got shot doesn't mean you will be.

Okay, so the fundamental problem here is that you're disregarding the well-established norms of human behavior.
Do you think it's random chance that anthropologists *never* observe groups of more than a few hundred without a power structure?
Altruistic behavior toward everyone is observed in some rare individuals that are just really nice, and within families (obviously there's evolutionary reason for this). But, again, for evolutionary reasons, we're also programmed to be competitive in larger groups. We will, based on millions of years of evolutionary programming, compete for resources in large groups. This is the fundamental engine of capitalism; funneling greed (abstracted genetic competition) into productivity.
You can't simply remove rewards from a capitalist system and expect it to function. You cannot just expect semiconductor engineers to do things for free. You cannot expect farmers to hand out their food.
If humans behaved the way you describe, we never would have needed to start trading in the first place. We would have just given each other shit.
So it has nothing to do with what anarchists are "opposed to", and everything to do with the people that make up the groups.
If you associate on the basis of profit - which would be in line with human behavior - you've got anarcho-capitalism.

Altcoins are even worse. Nobody - and I mean NOBODY - outside the Bitcoin community knows or cares about them. To the uninitiated, the receipt of an altcoin tip is a demonstration that crypto is "fake money" that any programmer can create at will.

That argument is certainly made for gold. Buffett thinks so. But I can't see why gold would collapse now, in the midst of uncertainty about the new economic paradigm, after thousands of years of stability.
The USD is worth something because the government of the most powerful nation on earth wants it to be, and because the largest economy on earth is legally mandated to pay tax debts in USD.
The answer is currently B and I'd bet on it staying that way.
There is a microscopic chance of it being C and thus a small part of my portfolio that would otherwise be in the stock market to scoop up free QE dollars from Uncle Ben is allocated to C.

I'm actually thinking of writing a novel set in a dystopian anarcho-capitalist future, where political governments have been replaced by corporations with absolute control.
A plot arc involves a small, utopian community like what you describe. A few thousand like minded people have escaped corporate dominance and are living happily together in a sustainable community.
The nearby corporate state sees this as a threat (using corporate land and resources) and kills all of them.
The point I'm making here is: yes, a small, limited-technology utopian culture is possible. Sociologists and anthropologists agree it can be done (and they've existed before). But the whole world can't be utopian - you'd have to have millions of little sustainable enclaves.
But the problem is when the evil organization comes in from the outside and kills everybody for their resources or enslaves everyone. What then? How could you defend yourself against a much larger group?

Diversification is not a myth. The reduction of volatility *is* +EV. This is observable by the fact that bonds with higher nominal +EV are always more volatile.
The false assumption you're making is that you can identify the highest-value asset dependably. Sorry; you're not smarter than the market. If you could be correct more than 51% of the time you could get rich on derivatives far faster than making a play on Bitcoin. The potential for Bitcoin to explode to 10x its price or more is already priced in.
If you're old enough to call yourself a "professional gambler", you're too old to be risking your entire savings like this.
By the way,


Gambling is associated with neutral or -EV. Investing, over an arbitrarily long time period, is +EV (which is unsurprising given the natural growth of technology, material wealth and economies).

Look, it's not that the utopia you're imagining wouldn't be great and all, but it's not possible. If you tried to create it, a lot of people would get hurt. It's not worth it.
As for this,


*HOW* exactly do you imagine any of these things happening? It's hard enough to make all this happen with the vast resources of government. Things don't magically organize themselves.
By the way, social disapproval of slavery doesn't stop slavery. In the US it has been mostly stamped out (by the government, by guys with guns that said "fucking stop", btw), but in other countries, including Eastern Europe, it still exists - not because it's socially acceptable, but because there are some very bad people out there, and the government hasn't been able to stop them.
Bad people don't stop existing because there isn't, and selfless people that are going to provide for disabled people and build rehab centers and build roads and power lines and fight polition don't magically start existing because the government goes away.
You're living in a dream world. How about joining the fight to make government *smaller* rather than wasting your time with something impossible?

Instantaneous growth is dE/dt, where E(t) is the exchange rate ratio USD/BTC.
The metric of interest (smoothed growth) is dE/dt, where E(t) is the moving average exchange rate ratio for some reasonable period (10d if you're looking at the history of Bitcoin, maybe 1-3 days for shorter periods like months). So you'd get a graph over the last 10 years of dE/dt where E(t) is the 10-day moving average exchange rate ratio.
Serious question: how did you get the idea that log(x) is the same as growth in x? They're not even similar.

Well, ZAR has had some very bad weeks in the past, if you zoom out. There are lots of currencies; yours was the one that had a bad couple of weeks while Bitcoin had a good couple of weeks.
It's appears inflationary because ZAR has been sloped steeply downward in the past few years. I doubt the PPP of the ZAR has changed much in such a short time, so that is most likely true inflation.
*Edit:* Looks like I was inadvertently cherry-picking data myself: I was looking at the 2Y graph, which trends down almost exclusively. The few years before that trended up, so it's not a long-term trend.
Based on the graph I had suspected almost 15% inflation, but the real number is apparently 6%. That's still quite a lot compared to the current USD rate at 1%, but it's not really that bad.

No rolling blackouts, no mass poverty that didn't already exist, no tent cities or vastly expanded death and starvation. There was something that looked a lot like the Great Depression in the US, yes - and you'd expect that when switching suddenly from a Communist system to a Capitalist one.
The reality is that governments collapse *all the time*. Americans are simply unused to the idea because our government is very old.
As governments go, the US Government has the oldest intact Constitution in the world (1787). Two hundred some years is an extremely long time for a single edifice of government to be around. It could collapse, as governments do all the time.
And what happens then? Things go on, like they have in every country that goes through a regime change. People keep on living in their houses, keep on going to work (in general), keep on producing and needing to eat. Did you think that the collapse of the USSR magically made houses vanish and necessitated tent cities?
The money could disappear with the government. If it does, it is painful for people who have been saving exclusively in cash or bonds and do not own tangible value like real estate or stocks or gold - but that does not bring the economy to a halt for the rest of us. A division of labor still exists and people still want food and consumer goods. It's entirely possible to switch to Euros or RMB or whatever until a new government is formed.
I cannot see how the fire and brimstone would come about short of nuclear war. The worst outcome is a new government with an even less friendly attitude toward civil rights - but that's unlikely, because the attitudes of the people shapes government, and American values favor a (relatively) open society.

You mean what are my political views?
Government is an unavoidable evil. The good small government can do - and the protection it can provide from bigger, nastier governments - outweighs the coercive taxation. You want the smallest government possible that is still able to defend itself from other power groups: other countries, big cartels, etc.
So, basically a government that does this stuff:
1) *Defense*. Not "defense", where you spend half a trillion a year and invade deserts. *Defense*. For a nuke-equipped country like the US this actually doesn't take many dollars.
2) Basic science and research. Companies won't pay for this, because it doesn't turn an immediate profit, just opens up possibilities later on. But the social good that basic science does for humanity *cannot be overstated*. The internet, tons of medical advances, you name it - government funds. It really is a pretty small part of government spending, and it's worth it.
3) Roads and infrastructure (power lines, etc). It's the best way.
4) Legal system. The whole "no slavery, no murder" thing is pretty important. It also gives some recourse for scams and similar stuff, so consumers can spend with more confidence.
5) Pollution controls. It's cheaper to pollute than not to pollute, so somebody's gotta control that.
6) Disability laws and rehab programs.
7) Maybe a universal health program. It's hard for me to decide on this one. Idealistically I'm against it, because you're taking people's taxes to pay for it, but from a humanistic standpoint I think healthcare is a human right.
8) Defense of liberties (free speech, free assembly, etc), and protections against government getting any bigger than what I'm describing here.
9) Anti-trust legislation. This is part of "government defending itself from other power groups". Monopolies are a failure of the free market. No corporation should get too large.
That's it. That'd be like 5% tax.

You are making statements and passing them off as fact, yet you know next to nothing about the topic.
Do you understand how central banks work? Do you know how the money supply is expanded and contracted, what the discount rate and LIBOR are, how interest rates are set? Do you understand how a decentralized,  deflationary currency is the antithesis of the central banks - and did you know that many of the economists who run those banks have gone on the record saying Bitcoin is not a viable replacement for the current system (they're right)?
Bitcoin was invented by people who wanted to DESTROY the central banking fiat model. Read about its history. In NO WAY do the "powers that be" endorse Bitcoin as the next big thing. That is absurd. The Fed could simply start backing Bitcoin if that was the case.

The US has, for the most part, a legal system less strict than the PRC's.
So the translation is: more people choose to violate the established legal system in the US, and more people get caught as a result. 
I don't see that as an expression of excess force at all, more the opposite: it's most likely because people don't get summarily shot like they do in the PRC. We imprison all convicts - even if they have received the death sentence - because we believe they are entitled to a chance to prove their innocence.
We also have a shitload of gang-related crime that few other countries have to deal with, and as far as I am aware no other countries have successfully gotten it under control without imprisoning a shitload of people. Mexico is a war-torn hellscape in some places because the government lacks the resources to deal with the warring criminal elements.

None of these things constitute truly effective counterarguments, they just make it unclear *exactly* how bad the problem is.

I'm already seeing the start of a nascent Bitcoin banking system (coinbase.com, in particular).
2) I'm a semiconductor industry insider. Few people seriously believe Moore's law has more than 10 years left in it, which is when we're doing these projections.

When I first started voting I was hardcore Libertarian. Then I realized I would have to be a very callous person to do away with taxes completely, and softened my position some. Here's some of the reasons why, regardless of any *ideological* thinking, we need the government:
- Disabled people will no longer have any kind of aid programs or laws that they be treated fairly;
- Addicts and people with mental health issues, who are easily exploitable and prone to crime, will be on their own;
- Cartels that engage in human trafficking, drug pushing, and enslavement will be able to operate freely (*read: there will be little to stop people from taking slaves*);
- Neighborhoods on the brink of race war may implode;
- Roads and power lines will still exist, but will be owned by monopolistic companies that charge whatever they like;
- Pollution would be rampant and will kill millions (see 
You don't have to like taxes. I don't. And I'm not saying that you're wrong that the system is unfair. But we *need* taxes. I'm all for cutting defense and corporate welfare and all sorts of crap, and giving that money back - but there are some things we really can't do away with.

Generally small businesses need every cent they rake in, if not for compensating employees and inventory and overhead, then for growth.

I really haven't got the motivation to debate the problems inherent with anarcho-capitalism with you. Suffice to say that all you're doing is trading traditional representative government for non-representative corporate governance in the long run.
In the short run, if you want to see what the chronic lack of a strong central government looks like, check out Somalia.
Suffice to say, there are only about 100,000 people online out of 9 million in Somalia, and that happened in the last few years alongside the formation (at last) of something resembling a government.
You need a lot of things before the Internet is possible. You need engineers and scientists and electricians, sure. IT professionals, people rolling cable.
You also need infrastructure. You need a power grid, you need data centers, you need millions of miles of fiber optics and routing hardware. At the beginning, all of that - and today, still much of it - was supplied by the government. *And it is because of that fact, the use of common government resources, that the Internet today is free and open rather than owned by a company*.

Your distinction is absolutely meaningless - Bitcoin is fiat.

2) Yeah... I'm biased because I've got an academic background. I'd like to think that science does enough good that it's worth it, and that nobody else is gonna fund it... but maybe not. Private universities still exist.
3) I'd be interested to see a viable alternative. I haven't explored many, so I'm not sure they don't exist, but since you need a government to fill that power vacuum anyway... why not? It'd be a tiny fraction of the taxes people currently pay.
5) No murdering the earth? :P I don't know - the legal code is pretty specific to entities that are alive rather than huge balls spinning through space. I think this sorta falls into  Don't do shit to the earth that will harm other people.
6) Yeah, rehab programs could be donation-based. A lot already are. But you need the force of law for disabilities - non-discrimination, for example. Ideally you wouldn't *need* that sort of law, but... people are dicks.
7) I kinda want it to be opt-in, so you'd have the option of paying an extra couple percent to be covered. That might work. The wealthy would opt out, but there's still more wealth in the middle class than the upper class.

When a company manufactures a computer for $400, and sells the computer for $440, where does the extra $40 come from? Does the $40 not exist? Is the $40 not in the system? 
No, because not every dollar in existence is being used to buy computers. Not every dollar in existence is out on loan.
You've already decided that interest is a bad thing, and you're trying to construct an argument for *why* it's a bad thing after the fact. The artificial scarcity thing you're describing only works if you have a simple economy in which everyone *is forced to accept* a 10% loan.

That is hilariously untrue from even the most cursory glance. I don't even need a source; I can prove it with numbers.
Let's suppose that all inflation is caused by the government printing money (it's not). Then the yearly revenue would be the inflation rate times M2, the outstanding "real" base of money (much larger than the base of physical currency - but we'll assume that the government has no trouble printing "virtual" money by making loans to banks, which they do).
So, let's say 3% inflation (it's been less in the last few years: 
And M2 is known to be 10.5 Trillion USD (
I encourage you to verify both of those numbers - that data is freely available all over the internet.
So we get 0.03 * $10.5T = $315B/year in "inflation money" (again, assuming erroneously that the government causes all of the inflation through printing).
Let's mosey on over to the handy US Federal Budget tables here:
(you could use  to back this up)
The number of interest here - total federal income tax reciepts - is **$1,521.7 Billion in total receipts**.
So by comparing $315 billion, the maximum amount that the government could *possibly* make off inflation in the ideal case, to $1521.7 Billion, the actual tax revenue, we know that your statement *cannot be true*.
Just because a "truth" would be convenient to your worldview does not make it so.

I don't doubt those accounts were frozen for being related to Bitcoin, but it's not because the banks were unfriendly to Bitcoin. That is a misconception.
Big banks like BoA stay in business by systematically reducing risk. If a bunch of transactions show up from Bitcoin exchanges, BoA will just close that account, because the odds are much, much higher that something nefarious like money laundering is going on. Think about what happened with Dwolla and Mt Gox - Dwolla lost a lot of money when the Feds seized the accounts.
To a huge bank like BoA, closing a few Bitcoin-related accounts is better than taking on that risk. To a startup like Dwolla, it was a big chance to get new customers, so they took the risk (and have since changed their minds and moved away from Bitcoin, unsurprisingly).
I am sure that if BoA didn't think Bitcoin-related business was risky, they would welcome the extra revenue. It's got nothing to do with being "unfriendly". Business is business.

Or it shows they don't want to go to jail for a long time?
The amount of money donated vs the amount of money paid in tax isn't even close to comparable. A lot of people would suffer a LOT more if people stopped paying tax (i.e., a lot more than people who already pay tax currently suffer). 
And no, people wouldn't donate more if there was no tax. The amount donated in countries with really high tax rates is often HIGHER than the amount donated in countries with low tax rates. This makes perfect sense, since societies that vote for high tax rates tend to be more generous in the first place.

My point is that Bitcoin is the only method that CAN be implemented without a third party, so criticizing it on the basis that all the others are offered by third parties is meaningless.

I also want to talk about this. Obviously there are lots of unethically produced goods today, and they are definitely not being boycotted sufficiently to cause unethical production to cease.
It is not true that the government resorted immediately to force; the Northern states (who were not profiting directly from the enterprise) tried negotiating for DECADES with the South to end slavery before the outbreak of war. The war itself was fought to preserve the union -  an understandable self-preserving action, else countries would be constantly fragmenting into useless pieces.
That undesirable fragmentation would have been necessary to even enable the tariffs you are talking about.
In general, though,  I do agree that big governments often make heavy handed decisions to use force. So I put it to you: do we solve this problem by disbanding government and ending the protections government provides to the vulnerable,  and removing all disincentives to exploiting people, or do we use every tool available to shrink government instead (... Bitcoin)?

Ah, right, the wiki said 0.11 µm. 
I can't see why you'd ever get a run of less than a full wafer, especially if you've gone and paid for masks. For a die size of 15 square mm and a 200 mm wafer with 5mmEE (total diameter exclusion 10mm), you get an inscribed square area of 2*(190/2)^2 = 18050 square mm, and your minimum number of chips is over 1200.
Basically, you'd better be damn sure your design works *before* you get it made.

No, no, it's nothing to do with order book depths. It's due to the fact that dollars are illiquid compared to BTC. Arbitrage seeks to exploit the difference between prices on different exchanges for profit, but it's very hard to move value between exchanges; you buy BTC on BTC-e, sell it on Mt. Gox... now what? Your money is going to take a long time to get back from Mt. Gox to BTC-e ( and you may be charged fees that make it unprofitable). So there is typically a price differential.
With Litecoin, you can buy BTC on BTC-e, sell them on Mt. Gox, buy Litecoin on Mt. Gox, and sell it on BTC-e. This is virtually instantaneous, closes the arbitrage loop, and stabilizes the price of BTC regardless of what exchange you purchase it at. That will help break the stranglehold that Mt. Gox has on the exchange market, I believe. It's a very important role.

Actually in this case you are correct. Bitcoin will not be effective for remittances. This is because Bitcoins will become cheap to buy in the places where they are sent, and expensive in the places they are sent from. So even if the actual cost of sending the Bitcoins is low, you still end up paying the remittance fees one way or another.
This is of course a failure of the current banking system - it's too expensive and difficult to arbitrage the difference between exchanges for less than it would cost to just remit traditionally in the first place.
But if Bitcoin actually becomes a real currency in the sense it is used for B2B transactions and to pay wages, THEN remittances will be cheap through Bitcoin.

I keep most of my money invested in diversified stocks... I'm not an idiot.
QE has proven to provoke very little inflation. That is counter-intuitive based on our understanding of economics, but it is true; look it up. That implies our understanding of economics may be incorrect or misleading. Do not assume that your understanding of economics dictates what can and cannot happen - it is just an explanation of what we have seen in the past. New evidence demands a new narrative.
From a basic macro perspective, the explanation for why QE has triggered so little inflation is primarily that the dollar is the world reserve currency. In other words, so many people around the world are willing to hold dollars that it has not been (so far) an issue to print a trillion dollars a year.

Shares in ASICMiner have pretty dismal outlook for return, in my opinion. Yes, the 50% yearly return looks good right now, but the competition is coming fast, and the value of ASICMiner will drop precipitously when it does.
Buying ASIC chips - *not* complete miners - from Avalon is pretty clearly the best option right now. You can get them put on boards and sent to you in ~10 weeks. Price is less than $50/GH/s. (Avalon round 3 was $5k for 65 GH/s, so it's actually a better deal AND may get delivered sooner)

There's very little real value here. Those articles you are reading are incorrect - the Bitcoin ASICs can do zero flops. When we had a GPU network it was sort-of-true, but past a certain amount of computational power nobody is going to be easily overpowering the network. So why does it matter whether we're more powerful than 10, 50, or 100,000 supercomputers? That doesn't strike me as "value" unless that hashing is doing something useful (and it isn't).


Do you expect that trade to increase in the future, or continue to die out?


I agree... which has probably got to do with why every year it increases vastly in price.

Obviously the drug policy in most countries is unfair, and causes unnecessary human suffering.
That doesn't change the fact that organized crime exists for many, many reasons beyond exploiting the drug black market. If you believe in property rights, then you need some kind of organization (flatly: the government) to protect those property rights from organized criminal elements that would abuse them for profit - like the illegal mining of Mexican cartels (see post below about this).
In places where the government has been unsuccessful in stopping organized crime, things are very shitty. Mexico, again, is a good example.
It is my firm belief that government should be just big enough to enforce a sane and reasonable code of laws that are written to protect individual rights. Obviously drug prohibition has no place in such legal code, and happily that means the size of the government necessary to enforce that code is incrementally smaller.
And further, people that would propose that the code of laws in the United States can be reasonably compared to the one in the People's Republic of China, especially considering consistency of enforcement, are very misled, and worse, they are misleading others.

Uh, yeah, because slavery would still be ongoing if there wasn't a bigger power structure to stop it.


Lol. The South needed slaves for their economy more than they needed their exports not to be taxed. Regardless of how nice it would have been to end slavery without a war, you are still talking about huge government involvement.

If you want another example of a corporation gone wild that it took a government to stop, look no further than Standard Oil. And all the arguments of 'free association' are bullshit here - people NEED oil to survive in the modern world.

While there's a lot of research that indicates this is true for human *senses*, numeracy is different. Instead, the research for numeracy indicates that the *error* in perceiving countable groups is logarithmic. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.
It's better to know that there are *exactly* four lions, than that there are *exactly* 100 antelope. Being off by one lion is more likely to impact our genetic fitness than being off by one antelope. So understood simplistically, if your error is 10%, you're somewhere between 3.9 and 4.1 lions - and 90 to 110 antelope.
That said, it makes comprehension of things that grow very fast hard for us to accurately comprehend.
A log graph is best for perceiving rate of change. If you want to compare value, obviously you must use a linear graph.

That's not the point. The point is that about half of the bitcoins that will ever exist have already been mined, and that a company with about 20% of the current network hashrate is worth almost 10% of the outstanding bitcoins.
Think about it. Only about a million BTC are being made a year, at this point, so that's 200k for ASICMiner (again, valued at 800k). 20% of the hashrate now isn't worth nearly as much now as it was two years ago.

I think you underestimate just how handcuffed the GOP is by its Tea Party caucus. I still think the probability of technical default is less than 50%, but not by much. And the market does not appear to agree, since that has clearly not been priced in. A 10% drop in the DJIA/SP500/NASDAQ would surprise me not at all.
It would be a technical default, of course. The US, via the Fed, can have as many dollars as it pleases. In fact, I'd be less than shocked if we see a debt-for-equity swap or a trillion-dollar coin minted within the next couple of years, in order to wipe out some Treasury debt using the Fed's QE bonds.
What is clear is that the situation isn't going to go away. Even if the debt ceiling is raised, it will only be until the end of the year, when the Dems want to undo the sequester.

What new stabilizing mechanisms do you anticipate? The hype cycles that power the bubbles are not hard to understand, and will not cease acting on the ecosystem any time soon. Most people who own BTC own it as a speculative investment, not with any intention of spending it.
Unless that changes - and the truth is, the size and growth of the Bitcoin economy will take many, many years to justify the current price - it's hard to expect that Bitcoin will magically stabilize. People would rather speculate than save and spend if they expect large changes in price.
And that keeps the large changes in price going *ad infinitum*.
Unless, of course, Bitcoin gets outside help - like being used as a clearinghouse for USD-denominated transactions.

That's a hard point to prove, although possible. Do you have a quantitative argument? Historically, though, the Fed has demonstrably contributed to the stability of the USD. Whether it's worth it is another discussion.


It's certainly made the government stronger, which pretty much defines the whole "order and stability" thing. There were always very clear rules (order) that everyone must always follow (stability). Now there are more rules, and more ability to enforce them...

25 BTC per block, 6 blocks an hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
1314000 BTC per year.
About 20% goes to ASICMiner. As new companies enter the scene and Avalon spams chips everywhere, that number might even drop.
So, 262800 BTC to ASICMiner. Okay; there are 400,000 ASICMiner shares outstanding, and trading at over 2 BTC - that's over 800,000 BTC market cap.
So at this rate the block reward will halve again (over 3 years) before they pay off. And we're assuming they're going to maintain 20% mining share... tall order for 3 years.

If you can demonstrate to me a feasible method for enabling semiconductor fabrication within the confines of a purely egalitarian society I will be very impressed.
What it comes down to, from my perspective, is that egalitarian anarchy - the kind you're talking about - demands small, randomly assembled groups (family and friends, basically). But semiconductor fabrication requires highly educated inviduals and TREMENDOUS external resources (millions of dollars of equipment, rare chemicals) including a cleanroom. The individuals have to be in one place to take advantage of the cleanroom - and constructing many cleanrooms would be extremely impractical.
So, since one demands small, random groups, and the other demands large, highly ordered ones, I simply cannot see the possibility of mutual compatibility.

A decrease in the price level due to productivity is not necessarily a universal positive. Wealth increases by objective measures, which is positive, but a trend of increases in the price level incentivizes hoarding and disincentivizes spending. 
Why would you buy a new car today if you can expect that they will be making them much cheaper in a couple years? Keep your current car or get a used one.
Obviously that impacts the velocity of money, which causes credit to become scarce, the prime rate to increase, and economic growth to slow.
Sustained productivity gains are a net positive to society because, obviously, their positives outweigh their negatives. But structural deflation, caused by the economy growing faster than the money supply, has the same effect I just described without an accompanying increase in real material wealth.

Bitcoin could be:
* Hacked (SHA-256 could be broken, or the underlying code could have serious flaws)
* Replaced (by a better cryptocurrency)
* Forgotten - the hype cycles could die off eventually if most people decide they don't really care enough to adopt it
* Destroyed via centralization - One entity could have such an edge on ASIC manufacturing and electricity cost that they could control well over 50% of the network.
And ultimately, the most likely one:
* It could coexist with the financial system, like gold and silver

Hopefully he has discrete, redundant security for different servers, so you can't hijack all 48% at once. Perhaps that's too much to ask.

Yeah, the future is pretty nuts.
3) Off-blockchain is an interesting idea, and if I understand correctly is the basis for things like Ripple. It will be interesting to see how it plays out - but this should still be understood as a weakness, since people would basically start using *Ripple*, not Bitcoin, as the means of transaction. Also, you're now holding Bitcoin *debt* instead of Bitcoins, which almost everyone agrees is bad.
4) I think we have a lot of reason to believe a government might spend $100M to have a major semi company develop a 22nm ASIC and permanently destroy SHA-256 currencies. Not yet, but if they decide the risk of money laundering and drug trafficking is too high...
Scrypt is trickier, but they could just rent a shitload of GPU clusters, too. Killing crypto currencies comes down to money: can you afford to pay for more power than the whole network?
There will be a critical point when large corporations and governments will no longer be able to practically kill cryptos, but we are nowhere near that point yet.
**Edit:** I should elaborate on why that would be "death" for all SHA-256s.
Obviously, the value would disappear as soon as the attack is identified. With the Bitcoin/USD exchange price goes the motivation to mine (since electricity and hardware costs $). You'd be better off spending your USD on super-cheap Bitcoins than on electricity. The hashrate plummets and virtually all of the network speed becomes the attacker (government/large corporation)
With the hashrate now in the toilet, the government has complete, total control over the network, as well as a huge amount of SHA-256 ASIC hardware on hand. They keep maybe 10% of it running and shut the rest off. If anyone tries to rebuild - and that'd be a small fraction of the previous hashrate - they switch it all back on and decimate the nascent rebirth.

They ARE part of AWS, even if they're not first-party. Regardless, it appears nearly certain that BitPay and Coinbase will be offered through AWS, and highly likely that Bitcoin will be integrated into the first party solution in the interest of offering the most complete ecosystem.
The last thing Amazon wants is to lose AWS customers because they don't have Bitcoin integration. It is the trending thing and Amazon is not doing their job if they do not support it. Creating native AWS support for Bitcoin is associated with cost, but it's the cost of doing business as a web services company. 


Correct. This sort of change would be rolled out through AWS by their existing amazon.com technical support staff. No additional hardware, no contractors or consultants, no additional employees, just the decision to implement in-house what they already had to build for their AWS customers.

@_date: 2013-11-10 21:27:29
Uh, no. This is not fearmongering; increasing internet bandwidth was a matter of building more infrastructure. 
This is math and economics. The problem IS all the stuff that will get built to support Bitcoin.
As Bitcoin gains wider adoption, we expect its net value/"market cap" to approach the monetary base of a major currency. This means we're looking at $100,000 - $1,000,000 per coin, say $500,000. If that doesn't happen then Bitcoin failed in some way.
Obviously, at $500,000 equivalent per coin, that means the incentive to successfully mine a block is *vast* indeed.
So you will get thousands of companies all trying to mine that block. It is the nature of competition to drive profits down; the amount of money spent on attempting to mine the block will be within about 10% of the amount of money actually generated by mining the block.
In other words, if it takes 10 years for Bitcoin to displace another major currency, at which point the block reward would be 6.25 BTC, then the reward per block is $3,125,000. This ignores transaction fees, which would just make the problem worse - perhaps an order of magnitude worse.
Anyway, continuing with the math, that makes $3,125,000 roughly 6 times an hour (~1 block every 10min) and therefore 6 * 24 * $3,125,000 = $450,000,000 a day, or 450 million dollars per day. If we figure 10% of that is profit, then the miners spend about 405 million dollars a day just mining blocks.
Some of that will be spent on air conditioning and the miners themselves. But I'd say probably 2/3 of it, in the long term, will be for electricity - 270M/day.
Now, the place where that thread was wrong was on the electricity price, $0.10/kWh. That's a decent average price, but companies will not do the average. If they get $0.10/kWh, they will go out of business, because you can get electricity for $0.01/kWh in Siberia and North Central Washington State. Long term I expect that cheap energy will be depleted, but dedicated power stations will be erected next to huge mining farms, eliminating normal expenses like transmission loss and duty cycle/load percentage. I'd expect an average cost on the order of $0.03/kWh.
So that means $240M / $0.03 = 8 billion kWh/day, or 8 TWh/day (terawatts). 365 days in a year means 8 * 365TWh = **2920TWh/year**.
We use the 2025 projected numbers here  (bottom line) to obtain an estimate for global 2023 power generation: 29.8 Trillion kWh, or **29800 TWh/year**.
2920/29800 * 100% = +9.8% *otherwise unnecessary* global power consumption. This constitutes an environmental disaster by anyone's standards.


They don't use *nearly* this much power, but they DO hurt the environment.
If you are going to bury your head in the sand and call me a "fearmonger", I can't stop you. For my part, I don't give a shit; Bitcoin will do significant environmental damage, but I don't care. Environmental damage won't stop the rise of Bitcoin. But we shouldn't lie to the environmentalists.

While I understand your concern about Bitcoin/Fiat exchange, you're ignoring the fact that there are many, many governments worldwide. If the US government makes Bitcoin/Fiat exchange intractable, exchanges will pop up in other nations that see profit in protecting the identities of the individuals who do business within their borders.
It is true that Bitcoin isn't completely anonymous, but it's not hard to protect your identity. I think the blockchain ends up being more useful than harmful, since it is an amazing arbitrator and allows things like wallet signatures to prove ownership of previous transactions.
I wish initiatives like Zerocoin and Open Transactions all the best; they have obviously been conceived and developed by sincere individuals trying to make the Bitcoin ecosystem a little better.

Do you actually know how this works? Do you think they ship a pallet of crisp $20 bills to every billionaire on his birthday?


So, actually, the people with no money (the poor) don't lose money due to inflation, since they don't HAVE any. The rich people suffer more. I'm not sure how you've convinced yourself otherwise. Hyperinflation actually LEVELS the playing field, even though it's super bad for the economy.
You do know that you can increase the inflation rate without printing a single dollar, right? Read about bonds and the money supply.


Actually, no, it becomes negative (after the initial mining rate dies off). Like I said, inflation is more than just "how much money is printed". It's tied to the velocity of money and the size of the economy, as well. Basically, 0% inflation is when the rate of creation of money equals the rate of new demand for money.
Bitcoin will be deflationary, which is even worse than inflation. Why is it bad that your money becomes worth more over time? Because that encourages people not to spend it.

In the real world, when someone accepts a loan at interest, it’s because they believe the money is more useful to them now than the principal plus interest would have been in the future.
This is often because they are able to make more money in that period of time than the difference in interest. That’s basically the idea when you fund a company.
Without that loan, the company wouldn’t be able to do business, and without the interest there’d be no motivation to make loans (you’d lose money in the long run because of defaults, in fact).
Back to the 440 tokens thing: yes, they take them from someone else. How does that happen? They create something with that money that people WANT to pay for. That’s what companies do. Let’s imagine your local shoe store. They take a loan, use it to buy a bunch of shoes, then make them available to people in the area. They’ve provided a service: making the shoes available and letting you try them on. The additional amount they charge for their shoes to cover their loan (and rent and taxes and so forth) is something you are happy to pay for the convenience.
So the tokens aren’t really being “taken” at all – they’re being given happily. Your simulation of 400 tokens loaned at 10% is false – because nobody would accept such a loan unless they had more use for 10 tokens NOW than 11 tokens at the end of the round.
And since nobody is doing anything with their tokens (i.e., there is no economy), nobody actually needs 10 tokens now.
Interest is a positive thing. It lubricates the transfer of wealth and allows the vibrant economies you see today. Inflation is yet another thing the religions had wrong, like stoning people to death.

2. No motivation for the average consumer to adopt it, since they don't pay credit card fees, and have to learn how to keep their coins safe; this alone is enough for the average person to NOT use it
3. Blockchain bloat is already getting out of control and could never support tens of millions (let alone billions) of people

The percentage of bitcoins used for drug trade is much higher than the percentage of fiat used for drug trade. We can at least agree on that.

At this point it is obvious this discussion is pointless. Apparently an announcement by an Amazon.com competitor hasn't caused enough cognitive dissonance for you to consider you might be very wrong.
AWS would integrate Bitcoin and not the other payment processors because it is a different way to pay, not just yet another payment processor. I'm guessing that if I want to pay for my cart on Amazon with something exotic like  Qatari Riyal, they won't turn my money down because it's an "also-ran" currency. Accepting many different currencies is part of the realities of running a ecommerce website. Here's how they handle it now, which CLEARLY has no room for Bitcoin: 
You are obviously very bitter about having missed your opportunity to get in early on the force of nature that Bitcoin is proving to be. I can sympathize with that. I am not sympathetic, however, to your decision to continue to spend your time decrying Bitcoin rather than reversing your mistake.

You are missing what I mean by "credit issues".
With the economy growing at that breakneck pace ( you need to borrow money to start or expand businesses. This is normal and necessary. A business owner/leader will choose to borrow money if he can make more profitable return on that money than he must pay in interest.
But if you have a fixed, limited number of dollars, and the amount of real goods is increasing quickly, then every year your dollars will be worth more.
Let's suppose this deflationary effect is about 5% a year (i.e., the economy grows 5% every year in terms of real goods produced, and therefore you can buy 5% more with a dollar). This is fairly accurate to the growth of the US economy during the mid 1900s.
Then a 5 year loan, given at 5%, has an effective rate of 10%. If the principal is $100, the total debt after 5 years will be $161 in current-day dollars.
Obviously this creates an incentive for business owners not to borrow, because they cannot be sure of making a profit with a real interest rate so high. And nobody would be motivated to lend at a nominal interest rate of 0% - which is still equivalent to a real rate of 5%!
So the solution is to create new money to offset the growth of the economy. This makes it easier to borrow, since inflation works in the favor of the indebted person and reduces real interest rates. All of that debt is critical and necessary for the healthy growth of an economy (to a point, of course).
So that "theft" is necessary to keep the economy growing, which is actually quite a bit more important than keeping the money valuable. I would much rather the economy grow 3% a year on 2% inflation than grow 0% on 0% inflation.
If you want to avoid that "inflation tax", the financial world has some wonderful options for you - Gold, Silver, now Bitcoin as well. Or you could just participate in the growth of the economy by buying stocks, which tend to vastly outpace inflation in the long term.
Is it really theft if you know the rules of the game and you have alternatives?

The discussion here is about what "sustainability" means, in the long run (I am entirely unconvinced about the "depression" bit, but perhaps I've done uncommonly well the past few years). Evidently every society that has existed thus far has proven unsustainable. It is not unreasonable to assume the same about this one.
My point is: so what? It's just paper. We will throw it away and print some new paper.

Yeah, that's not printing money, or companies are printing money too when they issue bonds.
It manipulates the money supply, but it also creates debt. Printing money does the opposite of create debt.

Most likely he is confused about the ending "HCl" after most prescription drugs - thinking it's some kind of notation meaning "this is a prescription drug".
Actually, the "HCl" notation is because many pharmaceutical drugs are basic and not soluble in water. However, they will react with hydrochloride to form salts. These salts are often water-soluble.
So, for example, with Prozac we have "Fluoxetine HCl". Fluoxetine alone is not very water-soluble, and we need it to be soluble to be readily digested, bound into pill form, etc. So the fluoxetine (free base) is dissolved in a solvent, like diethyl ether, and hydrogen chloride is bubbled through to form a water-soluble fluoxetine chloride salt. This salt is usually easily separated from the solvent.
To distinguish this salt from pure fluoxetine (which wouldn't be practical as a drug), you see "Prozac (fluoxetine HCl)" on the box.
The more you know.

Uhhhh... what? 3), the scaling problem, is well-known and there is currently no solution. It's part of the "logic" behind the altcoin boom, specifically that the Bitcoin chain alone can't be responsible for keeping track of every time in history some random Joe went to the store to buy a banana.  The hope is that someone comes up with some brilliant workaround, but no dice yet.
4) I'm talking about a government 51% attack (presumably because they decided they don't like Bitcoin and it's worth spending the money to kill it). They could stealthily build up while solo mining to 51%, then start double spending random amounts to random addresses with non-zero balances. Nobody would know when the attack started, who got how much, or anything. It'd be impossible to roll the chain back without killing some legitimate transactions.

One implies a 2-year value increase of $1B. The other, $99B.
Sure, there's a network effect, no doubt. But if you think that we will see value increase at *100 times* what we have so far, you're off the deep end.

They sold them - how is that any different from auctioning them off? They didn't use them to mine themselves, so why is it an insult if you do the same thing?
Still, keeping them is smart, because the time it'd take to pack it up and ship it is a huge value loss. You might see as much as $40k per unit in Bitcoins.

The whole damn chart is noise if your Y axis doesn't represent the actual exchange rate.
The derivative of a log chart is not the same as the derivative of a linear chart, and therefore you are obfuscating information about rate-of-change right alongside the actual exchange values.
The answer is to use moving averages if you're really concerned about noise.
**Edit:** [Here you go.]( Didn't have to use a log axis at all, so it's not misleading, just a 10d simple moving average to smooth out the "noise". If it takes away too much information you just reduce the period.

OK, thanks Danny.
If I may offer two points of suggestion -
1) Maintain an offshore fiat balance for Cyprus accounts, and a small working BTC wallet to enable exchange to and from those accounts. This is the only way to be 100% safe until Bitcoin establishes mature financial markets (we *will* get there, and if you play your cards right you might be the one to establish them).
Organically grow your business into the potentially huge market space. Do not get greedy early on and try to do too many things, or speculate with deposited Bitcoins. There is more potential profit in doing things right.
2) Having done 1), you should seek and obtain high-profile endorsements from people that *Cypriots trust*. If you have run your business in a way that is worthy of trust, this should be much easier to do.
Ultimately you will make your own decisions for this business, but if the first Bitcoin bank defaults, it will do serious harm to the ecosystem.

Just read this.
There are fundamental *rules* to Bitcoin, which all clients must follow. The block reward is one of them. Similarly, you can't just create coins out of thin air, even with 51% agreement. **Any block mined without the proper block reward as part of that block is invalid.**


Nope. You simply *cannot create* a Bitcoin blockchain that doesn't have the block rewards as laid down by Satoshi. That is not Bitcoin.

Patently false. The government prints some money (NOT hyperinflation, mind you, just more inflation than we're used to) and bam, problem solved. Governments cannot become insolvent in their own currency - any economist can tell you that. Do a google search and you'll see just how many economists do not agree (most of them).
Most importantly, the US holds the world reserve currency - printing dollars will not create as much inflation as you think, because there are people around the world ready to snap them up. Most international trade is done in dollars. People in places like Argentina, as you pointed out, would much rather have dollars than Argentinian pesos.
Still, "more" inflation is enough to rationally justify investment in gold and bitcoin. The doomsday scenario, however, does not follow.

The market cap of Bitcoin is $1.47B right now. $5.2 million dollars of transactions in March, which was a CRAZY month, doesn't mean shit.

Uh, yes it does. If you get your Euros from minting, is it capital gains? Income? Some third category? Tax-free, since there's no exchange of goods?
Once you've minted it and *then* it changes value, it's definitely capital gains. So the capital gains are calculated based on the value *at the time of minting*, not at the time of exchange.
If you're running a Euro mint with currency constantly coming off the line, and your USD/Euro exchange is highly volatile, how exactly do you compute capital gains? You'd need to invent a new branch of fractal mathematics or something.

I picked option 3.
I purchased Avalon CHIPS. I am part of a grassroots pool to have cheap PCBs made for them.
$1000 = 128 chips * 282 MH/s = 36 GH/s.
PCB costs will be $500 or less per 128 chips for a total of $1500 per 36 GH/s, or $41.67 per GH/s.
Compare to Block Erupters.
Avalon doesn't do any mining, so they will continue to flood the market with these chips. Hundreds of people like me will turn them into ASICs far faster than ASICMiner can make Block Erupters.
And of course some if us will sell them at prices much more reasonable than Block Erupters.
If I could short sell ASICMiner, I would.

Bitcoin isn't a free money machine. Everyone is trying to make a quick buck, but you can't conjure more money - so half of the people who trade in the short term are gonna lose money.
Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology. Nothing like it has ever existed before. It has appreciated greatly *over many years* because it truly has value.
If you got into Bitcoin without understanding the value,  then you did it out of pure greed and you deserved to lose that money. If you had understood Bitcoin from the start and you thought it was a good deal at $1200, then you would never have sold at $700.

Considering it's very hard to do fractional reserve banking in Bitcoin anyway, wouldn't banks continue to prefer to make loans denominated in fiat?
I don't see why Bitcoin cannot exist side-by-side with fiat someday as a genuinely alternative currency. This is not without precedent: in Turkey, for example, the local currency is the Lira. However,  you will sometimes see merchants who prefer (or at least accept) Euros (occasionally dollars).
So on the case the merchant prefers Lira but accepts Euro, they will adjust their Euro prices to the Lira. Yet, if they prefer Euros but accept Lira, they will adjust their Lira prices to the Euro (I expect this is limited to the extent they owe tax in Liras).
Many countries are monocurrency but that doesn't make such a thing either necessary or optimal.

Hardware sales automatically mean Bitcoins that they will not mine. Assuming they *don't* sell any hardware is probably a more profitable scenario.

If I choose, I have enough money to comfortably retire at any time in the majority of countries on Earth. The only notable exceptions are the USA and Western Europe.

This is something government officials should work out on a case-by-case basis (and it being their job, they should be good at it). They'd probably have contingencies set up based on the kind of crisis, the severity, anticipated length, and number of people affected.
In general, the price levels should be maybe a few multiples of the typical base price, depending on actual scarcity. Nobody is going to starve because their food costs 300 or 400% more than usual for a couple of weeks, but it IS enough to encourage lower consumption, which may be very important.


Price levels change organically up to their limits. Price limits would be declared alongside the state of emergency (which is how it actually works in many states).


They'd risk being criminally indicted after the conclusion of the state of emergency. Obviously it would be a waste of resources to do anything during the disaster.

(Using bullet points forces you to put your numbers in order, and I was picking and choosing)
I had an interesting thought about what a non-tyrannical government should do. It should permit small-scale succession, within certain rules. 
For example, if you want to create another country associated with the US (we'll call it an 'Enclave'), and you and at least 999 other people who unanimously want to secede own at least 10 square miles of continuous land (plus some rules about proximity to other people's stuff), you can do so.
So if you're a political idealist, you can buy some land somewhere remote and start your own country. That means you make your own laws, you don't pay taxes, and if you want roads and power and stuff to run to/through your country, you gotta pay the US government cash for it.
Obviously, since your country is a bubble within the borders of the US, it gets military protection. If people start bombing the rest of the US coming out of it (terrorist haven, for example), that constitutes war and the US can invade. So that's not a counter-argument.
I mean - why not? What does the government lose?

Depends where you draw the line at "scam". They've consistently decieved their customers, and their customer service is *horrible*.
Also, they've started selling their ASIC chips directly for less than the miners. The delivery time is supposed to be ~100 days, which is clearly before most people will get their miners.

No, Avalon distributes. They've put in a bulk order (500,000+) and are distributing in batches of 10,000.
Avalon cannot mine on the chips. They are just chips. You can't mine on them without circuit boards, so what you are describing is impossible. The group buys have to assemble the chips themselves - that's what lets Avalon distribute so many of these so fast, since they're not doing any assembly.
That also means you need to arrange to have your chips made into a complete ASIC. Still, *far* better than any alternative.

I understand your confusion. At first glance that would make sense.
However, hedging via short sale is the dominant strategy. Selling hardware means that hardware isn't producing for me, which is an opportunity cost.
If I short BTC, then if it goes down I make money from my short sale, which covers the lower income from my miners. If it goes up, I make more money from my miners, which covers my short sale.
So shorting BTC locks the rate of return for my miners at the current level. In other words, it reduces risk for free, which is a good thing. If I want to gamble, I can go to a casino.
If I actually thought strongly it would go up or down, I would do what you are describing. I think ~$120 is a fair price level, so I'm exploring a short hedge.

Choose any government you DO trust, then. Doesn't have to be the US. And while you can't eat an iPhone, it is a consumer product. There are legitimate reasons why they avoid foodstuffs.
Here's something for you to try. Once every two weeks, go to a discount supermarket and write down the prices of
1) Pasta (a few different brands, keep track of which brand has which price)
2) Strawberries
3) Milk
You'll find that pasta will bounce around between maybe $0.70 and $1.30 a pound, strawberries will be all over the place depending on the season, and the milk will be pretty constant. Why?
Because wheat is a commodity with oscillating prices, strawberries have a harvest season, and milk is produced constantly all year round.
So using food would really fuck up inflation indexes (same for fuel). It's not a dishonest attempt by the government to scam Joe America, it's just not practical. The overall TRENDS for food and fuel will follow other consumer goods. That's the idea with inflation.

You might be surprised to learn there is a thriving Bitcoin-denominated securities market, and that there has been for several years now.
Regardless, Bitcoin need only stop growing in value so fast  for people to be motivated to begin spending it. And surely you agree Bitcoin has already done the majority of its growth.




You seem confused between AWS and Amazon.com, the retailer, which is what everyone else is talking about.
You have the memory of a chipmunk. If you'll go back and read the entire comment thread you will understand the following has been established:
1) You asserted that Amazon.com will not adopt Bitcoin because the savings on CC fees will not offset the cost of implementation
2) I countered that AWS will adopt Bitcoin because that's part of AWS' business model, and it is completely frictionless for Amazon to adopt Bitcoin if it's part of AWS
3) You claimed some reasons that AWS wouldn't adopt Bitcoin that have now been dismissed as invalid
4) You've now claimed that AWS services must be submitted by third parties to be added, which is comically untrue (extracted from anus much?) - there are countless first party services available through AWS, so obviously Amazon has no trouble initiating
So, basically, here is where this leaves us: it is entirely reasonable to expect AWS will integrate Bitcoin in the near future, and from there your objections about the expense of deployment are invalid since it's Amazon.com's native platform.

The Japan deflationary spiral is a complex topic, and I'm not inclined to type whole thing out here, especially since I'm on my cell phone and so many others have done a great job of summarizing the impacts of deflationary spirals. So instead I will give you some links, I cannot recommend enough that you read then if you want to understand the underlying economics.
The first is this one:
Despite dripping with pro-Bitcoin bias (obviously, it is on the Bitcoin wiki), it is fairly informative. The trouble is the ludicrous counterargument that it makes to the Bitcoin deflation problem - specifically that Bitcoin is different from the existing system because it lacks fractional reserve banking, and that Bitcoin fractional reserve baking cannot exist.
This is an absurd argument for the same reason it is absurd to say that fractional reserve banking is impossible for the USD because there are only so many dollar bills around. But the truth is that you don't need cash to spend money, and you don't need an actual bitcoin wallet to spend bitcoins. A lot of people are looking to off-blockchain transactions to help reduce blockchain bloat. Guess what: off-blockchain transactions means fractional reserve banking. A complete fractional reserve system doesn't exist yet because Bitcoin is only a couple of years old, but it will. Companies like Coinbase and Blockchain.info are already working on it.
From the other side of bias on the topic, here are some Krugman articles on Japan (yes, I know, Krugman - I disagree with him a lot, but these are good articles and you have to at least understand his arguments if you want to disagree with him).
Keep in mind that men like Krugman are experts and have spent decades doing nothing but studying economics. If we wish to disagree with them we should have good reasons.
The Bitcoin community is currently carrying on in a "there is no problem,  Bitcoin is perfect" circlejerk (obvious from how many downvotes I am rewarded with for the effort of composing these posts). If we want to see Bitcoin succeed, this is exactly the wrong attitude to take. We must aggressively address Bitcoin's shortcomings if we wish to solve them. Too many are choosing to hear only what they wish to.

Is it? Forcing businesses to choose between continuing to accept USD and closing would result in most of them simply continuing to accept USD (since things would have to already be pretty bad for closing to be the dominant strategy).
People won't stop believing in the USD unless they can't spend it anymore, and they will still be able to spend it if businesses have to accept it; and it would have to already be worthless (not accepted by other businesses) for businesses to choose to close rather than accept it. 
And, as I just demonstrated, that law keeps you from getting to the point where it would already be worthless (and hence businesses would choose to close).

That still doesn't mean there aren't exploits an attacker could use to steal your wallet. Attackers just haven't released a way to get root access on those devices yet.


This is pretty good advice and something I'd recommend to anyone trying to protect a large sum of money. Anything less than $50k, a clean offline machine is probably more than sufficient.
Keep in mind: attacks are rare, despite their technical feasibility, since only very competent attackers can execute them. In general attackers don't bother with people with small amounts of money - they'd rather go after the jackpot with sites like inputs.io, as we've seen yet again.

My reasoning is basically this: 10 years is an eternity in Bitcoin-time. By then we should have either pushed long beyond $1000/BTC, or we will have run out of the steam that kept Bitcoin growing at such an insane rate. If Bitcoin's price doesn't keep going, it won't keep dragging in more and more users, and more and more entrepreneurs won't be rushing in to deploy their Bitcoin goods and services.
Basically, Bitcoin has already created a Bitcoin "economy vacuum" to the tune of $2B/year (approximately, assuming a velocity of money of 1/year).
So one of two things must be happening. 
1) More people will continue to speculate, buying more time for a real, serious economy to develop.
2) Speculation will wane and the price will stop rising. With time (2 years+), people will lose interest, the speculative bubble will pop, and prices will collapse.
At the point at which 2) happens (if that's not within 10 years we're talking prices waaaaay over $1000/BTC due to 10 years worth of 1) ), then either the Bitcoin economy has had enough time to develop, and is resilient enough to survive the crash; or it isn't, having lacked enough development time, and the whole ecosystem gets wiped out and largely abandoned.
This does ignore the use of Bitcoin as a store of value, but ultimately I don't think that's going to be the major player here. It smells too much like a fad to be a trusted store of value.

It isn't a substitute but it's an alternative. The KI dose is usually about 100mg, but that is excessive and intended to ensure the thyroid is completely saturated.
100g of iodized salt should provide about up to 10mg (at least for salt sold in the US; unsure about China), which is obviously helpful if not completely sufficient.
Here's my source about concentration since I was attacked for spreading misinformation:  up to 100ppm KI (.01%)
I think it should be obvious that it is never optimal to use something for which it was not intended. If you have the time to prepare for a nuclear disaster, always use commercial iodine tablets.

Whether "plenty of people" - interpreted by me to mean "a user base including the average non-tech geek" - will materialize to do business through Bitpay remains to be seen.
Also, don't interpret the total transaction volume as real goods transacted. A lot of that is just money moving due to mining pools and SatoshiDice and developers fooling around.

Avalon is just getting warmed up too. They have every motivation to completely flood the market with these chips (they have a contract with TSMC, the biggest chipmaker in the world). The rate at which grassroots efforts can pop up to build ASICs is FAR greater than ASICMiner can have its own hardware built. This also means that ASICMiner won't be making any profit on reselling its hardware, since everyone will buy resold Avalon hardware made from these chips.
ASICMiner has a few good months. Then they're pretty boned. 50% ROI, therefore, is overvalued.

Iodized salt does help. A lot. Iodine is the most dangerous constituent of radioactive fallout because of the thyroid's propensity to absorb it.

This is true. When I say "the economy will suffer", I mean that the amount of real goods produced will decrease (the economy will shrink), and that wealth will be redistributed in a highly undesirable manner (people heading into retirement, and who are typically risk-averse, are going to get *fucked*, hard).


Ah, no, it does not necessarily benefit them. It is simply the dominant strategy, just like a poker player who has bluffed his way into a bad situation. It's better to fold, at that point, but they may still lose quite a bit of money. The last people to jump ship to Bitcoin will have lost almost all of their assets.


It gets converted *eventually*. Fractional banking would be gone, so credit would be almost impossible to obtain; many companies would become insolvent and go out of business; consumer confidence would be shattered... it would be very ugly for quite a while.


As an engineer, my way of thinking about it is that fiat is a metastable state. It's valuable because everyone agrees that it is, but it's not scarce and has no intrinsic value. Therefore a panic could destroy it (knock it out of the metastable state into the ground state).
This is a fundamental quality of fiat, and so I cannot argue that if it collapses in such a fashion, that the "guilt" would fall on any actor that precipitated the collapse. If a building collapses because of an earthquake, it's not the earthquake's fault that the building wasn't built strongly enough.
That does not mean, however, that we want the building to collapse because it's not strong enough to withstand earthquakes. It should either be reinforced, or the contents transferred before intentional demolition.


Okay, this is where we disagree. Let's start with the "entire body of irrefutable evidence debunking the deflation myths"; yes, I must have missed them, because I absolutely do believe that deflation is harmful.

to represent more of the groupthink rampant in this sub. Honest discourse about the current state of the Bitcoin market, and the risks inherent to investing, is *really fucking important* to make sure people aren't putting money in with a poor understanding of the risk they're assuming.
The average person would not look at $5.2 million transacted on a global scale and say "gee, that sure is *plenty of people*!". It's a tiny fraction of global commerce, easily explained by some crypto enthusiasts. We have not breached the transaction volumes that would make someone say, "whoa, that IS more than just a bunch of crazy anarchists and nerds".


Sure, that's true. But you can say the same for a clearinghouse like Visa, and the comparison between Bitpay's and Visa's volumes against M2 for their respective currencies doesn't make Bitcoin seem special.


Yeah, the chips are a big undertaking. Represents some effort on my part, too, because I have to get them on boards. I believe in Bitcoin, though, and I've got some money I'm not going to unduly regret never seeing again, so...
I'm planning to use the Bitcoin Store in the future. Still haven't gotten around to it. I wish the community would lend it more support - if we're really doing $5.2M through BitPay we should be able to get them to their sales goals. Kinda looks like they won't make it, which is too bad.

If you think JP Morgan closes accounts with Bitcoin related businesses because they "hate Bitcoin" you are straight-up delusional. They close those accounts because they are concerned about risk.
Remember how the US Government seized Dwolla accounts with millions of dollars in them? JP Morgan is not interested in having that happen to them. And Dwolla isn't anymore either. The difference was that Dwolla was originally willing to take that risk because they were making a buttload of money/new users off of it.

Frankly, I've spent more time thinking about why Anarcho-Capitalism is a fucking *terrible* idea than socialist anarchy, mainly because I don't think it's possible to avoid power structures springing up. But I'll play ball and imagine that anarchy is stable, in this case.


So there's a community with something else everyone else needs and wants to trade for. This sounds a lot like a company/power structure... but okay, sure, let's assume they're nice and give everyone else a good price. So the communities get together and build roads.
Who pays for the roads *between* communities? Certainly no individual community would do that alone?


That's optimistic, but impractical. (I'm speaking with some measure of expertise here: I'm an engineer with a background in semiconductor processing). It costs more to build a semiconductor fab than the Red Cross gets in revenue worldwide.
And it's more than just cost. We can imagine a community can build a crude steam-roller to help other communities build roads, okay. That only stretches the imagination a little bit. But microchips... no. way. Nuh-uh. I work for a company of 6500 people; about 1500 of us are responsible for *one machine* in the process of fabricating microchips. One. And we're highly educated scientists and engineers; the engineering division is 70% PhDs. There are millions of people worldwide like me who make microchips possible. The small communities you imagine aren't big enough to facilitate even one small bit of the puzzle.
Here are some of the things you need in a fab:
- A HUGE clean room. This takes a lot of design: HVAC and filtering systems, ultrapure water delivery, airlock rooms with gowning for personnel...
- Tons of connected facilities support. Arrays of vacuum pumps, dozens of gas feeds plumbed everywhere...
- Extremely dangerous, complex, or rare chemical compounds, like hydrofluoric acid and photoresists and TEOS.
- Capital equipment. This is the trickiest part - like I said, 1500 very highly educated people to make one machine. Film deposition (PECVD, APCVD..., usually $1M+), Plasma Etchers ($3-5M+), Photolithography ($11M+), and CMP and ion implantation machines and so on and on...
- Silicon wafers. It takes some serious tech to make silicon that pure.
I could continue, but there's not much point. It takes *millions of people* in a globally connected marketplace to enable consumer electronics. So... it's pretty hard for me to imagine little communities doing it, yeah. Basically impossible.
So you could have a bunch of little utopian communities that cooperate with each other, but the level of technology would be limited. Consumer electronics, the internet (and Bitcoin) would not be a part of your vision of an anarchist society, I'm afraid.
BTW: some evidence to back up assertion that power vacuums aren't stable.

This is not useful to the guy asking the question. If the US outlawed Bitcoin, it would be illegal. That's how we define the word "illegal". It is a different question from "would you be likely to get caught using it if it was illegal?" or "would outlawing Bitcoin stop its use?".

Well, we've passed that bomb for many generations now. It's hard to say when we're eventually going to encounter our environmental carrying capacity "for good" - humans have been remarkably adept at both increasing that carrying capacity and increasing the per-capita utilization of resources.
For example - the industrialization of farming has permitted exponential population growth in the past where everyone has been predicting doom and starvation (remember ~~Hobbes~~ Malthus?). Sanitation and medicine have greatly extended life expectancy and quality of life. New technologies - perhaps nuclear fusion, polymer solar, or biogeneration - may solve the energy problems. And eventually humans may settle other planets and indefinitely defer the inevitable resource problems.
The only thing certain is that if humanity stops innovating, things will fall apart real fast. That means we need a healthy economy. Deflation is a serious threat, in that regard.
Economies naturally grow over time. An ideal money supply grows in lock-step with that economy.
Edit: sorry, said Hobbes, meant Malthus.

It opens up questions like, "In the delay between mining and trading for USD, do I need to record the change in value for capital gains?

Oh, ok then.
Dollar denomination means dollars represent the nominal cost for a commodity, as I'm sure you're aware. You would need to exchange local currency for dollars to pay that nominal cost. So the local price of a dollar denominated commodity (oil, here) can increase in two ways:
1. The dollar goes up in the exchange rate against local currency
2. The price of the actual commodity goes up due to scarcity
Obviously 2. has nothing to do with your argument, since it'd be exactly the same for Bitcoin. 1. is the reason for most price spikes like the ones you're talking about; political instability drives people out of local currency into the dollar and the price for dollar-denominated commodities in local currency goes up.
This can be avoided by pegging the local currency to the dollar, which many developing countries do.
But let's consider the impact of dollar inflation. Clearly it does not influence 2. And in 1., in the long term, a dollar inflation rate higher than the inflation rate of the local currency will actually DECREASE the price of dollar denominated commodities in local currency.
**Edit:** By the way, to make my position clear: I do not think that inflation is a good thing, just that it's better than deflation (which is super bad news). Ideally money would just hold it's value exactly. But this is the real world, and inflationary policy *is* the better choice.

That's true, of course, but they're also subject to the laws and to their constituency. If they don't behave they get kicked out of office and possibly get in big trouble. They don't want that, so they *tend* to behave (to the extent necessary to not get in trouble, which is apparently the extent needed to get shit done). I know there's lots of scandals, but the average representative isn't as corrupt as you think.
I don't like the idea of taxes, but I can't deny the fact that government works. Sure, people donate after disasters, but imagine if the government wasn't there to help out. Katrina would seem pleasant by comparison.

Any individual currently heavily invested in traditional stores of value (almost everyone) stands to lose enormously if Bitcoin decimates the value of fiat. That much should be obvious.
So if Bitcoin *really does* start displacing fiat, the rational action would be to get the fuck out of the collapsing building, and grab a girder to replace your lost wealth (i.e., swap all your fiat for Bitcoin). That will be a self-reinforcing cycle; as more people jump ship, Bitcoin grows stronger and fiat crashes faster. Basically, it could start a panic about the value of fiat - and there's no safety net, since fiat has no backing.
(Note: I am not suggesting this is a foregone conclusion; all of this depends on Bitcoin adoption, but Bitcoin being deflationary won't stop people from jumping ship to protect their assets. Actually, being deflationary makes it a *better* store of wealth, which will help the initial adoption for people looking to invest.)
Once enough people have grabbed girders, boom, down goes the traditional economy. Now all that's left is Bitcoin, and it's deflationary. People can still do business with Bitcoin, but the economy will suffer under the deflationary environment.
Hence "enormous economic wrecking ball".

Let me guess. You're white, and you live in a nice neighborhood, and you think most of the rest of the world is like that?
Your prosperity is built on the backs of people much less fortunate. But still, caught up in your own selfishness, your best vision for the world is one in which nobody can tell you what to do *at all*. That's the most important thing - not having people tell you what isn't ok. Because fuck starving people, and people with drug problems and disabilities. Because those taxes are inconvenient, and you wish you didn't get speeding tickets.
Think about what would happen in places OUTSIDE your backyard. Just because you can fathom your neighborhood carrying on without the presence of the federal government doesn't mean that the rest of the world - the world that you depend on for your food, your clothes, and your creature comforts - wouldn't fall apart. And if successful people - like you and me - stopped paying taxes, the social safety nets and public order programs would disappear. The less fortunate would become even less fortunate. And those shockwaves would run up the chain, I assure you.
The ideological problem is simple - you're right, the government "shouldn't be able" to impose its will on us.

You are correct.
I'm not sure why I did not realize my mistake immediately. I guess there have been too many math-illiterates for me to assume the problem might be with my math.
Your case is compelling: if you want to double your money, your interest is indeed in the *relative* rate of growth E'(t)/E(t) - not E'(t) - which would instruct the use of a logarithmic plot.
As much as I dislike using logarithmic plots to represent metrics for which a logarithmic transformation would yield useless output, if our concern is *solely* relative growth, it does make sense.
Thank you for actually providing a counter-argument.
Edit: this realization actually permits me to do something cool. If this is our relative rate of growth, for which we expect a more-or-less linear trend in the long term, we get a post-bubble value of
I'll have to do some actual fits on this data (instead of the bullshit MS paint fit I did above), but if we cut out the first couple months, then we are able to attempt to remove the effects of the two bubbles. And the (MS paint bullshit) linear fit (which excludes the residuals from the "bubble" regions) gives a real value, right now, of about $50. Food for thought.
I think I might do a rigorous statistical analysis on bubble-adjusted growth trends (I'm suspicious it might be logistic, instead of exponential like the fit in this graph) and post it later. Will be fun to check for autocorrelation too. Thanks, I guess.

2) Server-side, establish an account and wallet for this user. Probably needs the same kind of technology used in BTC exchanges.
3) User can use 2 commands: getbalance and send. Send requires the PIN (maybe getbalance too). Send can use either a bitcoin address or phone number if the receiving party also uses the service.
4) If the user recieves transferred funds, they get an SMS text (to avoid spam, this only trips above a minimum transfer amount, say 0.01 BTC, otherwise they have to check getbalance).

Corporate hierarchical structures organize by offering mutual profit. Do you have an alternative way to encourage 1000 people with PhDs in semiconductor processing to gather in one place and work on one problem?
The fact that you'd compare revolutionary Catalonia to the modern semiconductor industry demonstrates your ignorance. Sure, you can work out who's going to work on which farm. But you *can't* have modern technology without either central planning or corporate hierarchy - people have to be paid.
(By the way, revolutionary Catalonia fell apart pretty fast.)
Going back to the example of small towns with road equipment: you can have small towns assemble spontaneously, and you can make the argument that a town will work together in an egalitarian fashion (there's some evidence to support this is possible up to a few hundred people).

Implying Bitcoin users can't do anything about it.
Understand that a huge part of the argument for Bitcoin's success is the [network effect]( The momentum of Bitcoin is extremely important. Just because it is going to increase global pollution by 10% doesn't mean people will abandon it. Just because hashpower will accumulate in a few regions doesn't mean people will abandon it.
Even if a viable crypto alternative appeared that wouldn't do either of those things, it is VERY HARD to get people to switch. Look at how hard it is to switch to Bitcoin itself.

First you'd verify the date of the blockchain hash,  which would prove the authentication was done when the coin wasn't valuable enough to bother going through all this trouble to fake.

Third, you'd verify the ANACS grading by typing the serial number into their database.

Right, and it's not hard to see where the breakdown of global economics emerges from the refusal to lend. New businesses will disappear with no capital; individuals will struggle to buy their own houses; and - perhaps the part that many await eagerly - governments must shrink or default.
But, clearly, credit crunches are bad for the economy. Deflation introduces a permanent sort of credit crunch.
Ideally, in my mind, inflationary currencies and deflationary currencies can coexist. Inflationary currencies could remain the currencies in which tax debts must be settled, among other things; deflationary currencies like Bitcoin will offer a haven, not unlike gold. The new feature is that it will enable cheap and effortless transactions.
**Honestly, though, I see Bitcoin more and more as a platform than a currency. Bitcoin over and over proves its unsuitability as a long-term store of value. Perhaps it is a good investment, but nobody would treat it as cash if half their value could be gone in a month.**
**No, instead what I imagine is Bitcoin powering transactions without the need to suffer the unstable and deflationary currency.** Regardless of what the exchange rate is, you can move from, for example, USD (party 1) -&gt; BTC (party 1) - BTC (party 2) -&gt; USD (party 2) with little effort. I am sure companies will soon offer cheap services to do exactly that. Imagine a company that can do what Western Union and Visa can do - for less. That's disruptive.
**Perhaps, in the long term, the use of Bitcoin as a transaction medium will stabilize its currency as well.**

This isn't how Bitcoin works. You can't just vote to raise the 21M cap.
A change to the protocol requires a hard fork, meaning it isn't Bitcoin anymore, it's an altcoin.

How exactly do you imagine that you would "bump" the card hard enough to develop a torque high enough to exceed yield stress in the steel bracket? They're recessed inside a frame, not to mention that any surface applying the force would have to be small enough not to contact the other cards... unless you whack them with a hammer, they're gonna be fine.

Matthew N. Wright.
I've heard of you, but I don't know your significance or your relation to Goat... I haven't been around long enough.
If you'll tell me from your perspective I'd be interested to hear it.

The same thing would happen to Bitcoin as would happen to banks and financial markets the world over: chaos.
A fully-functional computer like you're imagining will not be suddenly invented. There will be plenty of warning as the requisite advances are made, which gives plenty of time for banks and Bitcoin developers alike to prepare. 
Quit worrying about this and focus on scalability and dishonest mining pools, those are credible threats.

It's partially psychology, partially economics. 
Psychologically - owning bitcoins is seen as a way to own a "piece" of the value associated with the transaction platform. They are rare, divisible, fungible - they seem like a suitable store of wealth.
Consider also that the reasons for holding gold are essentially psychological. It has little practical utility.
More importantly, from an economics perspective, it appears to be true that bitcoins are worth more as they are used more for transactions - no currency has an infinite velocity of money. The people on either end of a transaction will hold that currency for a non-zero amount of time.
So if you have a billion people exchanging bitcoins every day, then necessarily you need enough equivalent bitcoin-value to be held by all those actors, even if it's just momentary to switch out to fiat. If nothing else, those coins are tied up for 6 confirmations in the blockchain every time they are transacted.
So, if the required equivalent bitcoin-value (I hope I'm being clear here) increases with the volume and value of the transactions conducted with bitcoins, then the value of the bitcoins themselves must increase to enable those transactions, since there are a finite number of bitcoins.
And that's good news for anyone holding them.

See above. 1) Shutdown, 2) not the FBI's job.


Probably because it wasn't part of the seizure, and it's nearly impossible to get at darkweb sites?


Are you suggesting this is related? Most likely the people running it decided to get out while they still had their freedom. Who knows?


Good question, I would be curious to know also. But that doesn't imply anything unusual, large sums move all the time.


This is an absurd canard. You think that if the takedown *was* staged they would have put that watermark on? It was probably some dumb intern. There is no rule about what the FBI can put on their takedown notice.

I've never had an HDD last me 10 years, and my SSD won't catastrophically fail on me like many of my drives have.

I think it's a coincidence, frankly. If you seriously believe there's something going on, give me your data and I'll run some statistical models on it to see if there's any truth.
I do not like bonds because they expose me to the dollar. People don't talk about it much, but I think the dollar is headed for some nasty inflation in the next decade (have to pay down the national debt somehow), and the bond market is gonna feel that a lot more than the stock market. Factor in that the return on t-bills is only a couple percent, and as far as I'm concerned they're not even worth the risk. I'd rather have stocks or (since it's cheap right now) gold.

If SHA-2 is cracked tomorrow all commerce will die. If a vulnerability is demonstrated tomorrow and it is cracked next year (exactly how all of the previous hashes, like MD5, have been cracked), then commerce will switch their hash functions and Bitcoin will die.
Comparing Bitcoin to computers and the internet is ridiculous. Not every tech-related product succeeded. Remember Webvan? Pets.com? Boo.com? They all went bankrupt even though the Internet succeeded. Bitcoin may die and another crypto may succeed.
You have a completely warped appreciation for risk.

Such naiveté.
What do you think a jailbreak IS? It's an abuse of software/hardware exploits to get root access to the device.
The fact that jailbreaks EXIST is proof that you can hack these devices.

Doesn't change the fact that competition like Coinbase charge 1% fees - and they buy coins very near their sell rate, so you know it's legit.

Satoshi is the most obvious example, since it's speculated he holds about a quarter million bitcoins. And not a single one of those has moved in years.
So he's within conceivable range, since he needs approximately $4000 each to become the first billionaire.
This article speculates he may have as many as a million bitcoins:
