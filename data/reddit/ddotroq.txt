Not really, apparently coffee is expensive here. ~$7 USD for a latte in the big chains (Starbucks &amp; Excelsior).

Where in Tokyo? I honestly struggle to find shops that accept it.

That site is cancer on mobile.

Thanks. I am hoping other shops begin to accept it as well. It would be nice to pay for my morning coffee with BTC.

I unsubscribed from the subreddit because I got tired of: 
"OMG THIS SMALL BUSINESS KNOWS BCH &gt; BTC!"
"THIS TWITTER CELEB MISPELLED 'BITCH' AND SPELLED 'BCH'!"
Literally any lame post about why BCH is better than BTC. Troll posts like this are the reason I exited crypto. Get your shit together and stop pushing investors away.

But you're speaking about profitability and dismissing potential gains. That's extremely ignorant.

What is the benefit of not using BTC.com to an individual? Not principal, just monetary. 
Bear in mind that BTC.com allows auto switching between most profitable BTC/BCH at the time. 
I am using ViaBTC which has a switch but the auto feature is very attractive and a reason why I am considering BTC.com.

Understood and I read that chain, however the main reason I left Slush was because you cannot mine BCH if you wanted to, which is currently more profitable than BTC.

Your first mistake is using CoinBase. You take a loss the second you buy your coins.

That's NOW, it wasn't the case 3 days ago.
My point is being completely missed here. Most pools offer the option to switch while BTC.com offers an automatic option.

I've learned my lesson.
Just hold. If you sell, it will go up 15%. Always happens to me. BS.

So none.
