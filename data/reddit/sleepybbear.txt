This is one of the main reasons I put money into crypto in the first place, I am hoping to utilize it in paying off part of my loans when I graduate.
I know it will be difficult to sell in a couple years, but debt free is going to be the best feeling. Hopefully my small amount I put in will be large enough to where I can still keep quite a bit in Crypto and still pay off all my loans!

I've noticed that if I give it a minute or so, the charts will finally load. Blockfolio is great though, I am really enjoying it.

I don't think it's considered micro, it's a few hundred dollars worth but maybe that is still micro when considering BTC price?

Wow, just download Blockfolio and put in everything I’m holding and this is awesome haha.
Thank you for the suggestion!!

I’ll look into it, I never really even considered an app. I just google the charts because I don’t want to be logged into my Coinbase account on my phone, I wasn’t sure how safe it was when being on public WiFi and things like that. Maybe I’m a little too paranoid lol

Okay, I gotcha. I'm still fairly new and it was odd to me how I didn't have a transaction ID yet but the BTC is basically lost right now to me as it is not showing in either wallet. I'm not worried about losing it I just didn't think it should take this long, a friend sent some yesterday in about 15 minutes so I was curious.
Thank you!
