Yes! It did eventually go through, after a nervous and long 5 hour wait!

I have no idea why i just bypassed the ID check.
Pretty confused and im sure it looks like im breaking TOS.

Thanks! Always glad to hear others stuck in the same situation. Glad to know GDAX says confirmed when it really isnt. Will give it a couple hours up to a day for it to withdraw. Im sure i saw bitcoin delays on GDAX too.

Ah, great! I was wondering why i only needed one ID when it stated two, im guessing this explains. Also feel better that someone else only needed 1 ID too!
Ill be using GDAX from now on, amazing website with zero fees. Pretty shocking its even somewhat related to Coinbase.

Nice to see others didnt need ID either.
Hope everything will be ok with GDAX.

Hi i only have one form of ID, I logged onto GDAX and i clicked the "later" button for another form of ID, at first it said unable to diposit because it needs ID which is fine, but then i logged into GDAX and it tells me i can deposit now? Why do i no longer need to upload a second ID?

Im in a panic because i currently only have 1 ID but am in the process of getting another.
Will i be ok for a couple days? Whats with all the stories of people getting their coinbase account shut down?

Thanks for the info. Im not buying much, but it would be nice to buy at around this price if things are looking to go up from here. Im watching closely so i suppose we'll have to wait and see!

Newbie question: does mining get less valuable as BTC goes down because theres less miners or because BTC is worth less? Would now be a good time to mine if bitcoin were to go back up in value?

It seems it! Can't wait to go to the moon, then the bottom of the ocean, then hopefully to the moon again!

It seems things have risen in the past few hours. As i am fairly new, i am wondering if i should buy BTC right now. Should I or is it likely to fall more?
