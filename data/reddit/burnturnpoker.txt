Yeah, I really want Fold to come back. Seriously one of the most fun things to use bitcoin on

Airbitz makes sharing bitcoin with noobs actually meaningful and fun. Kudos to the team. Looking forward to more Fold cards for more stores!

This is so awesome :)

Yeah, amazing how they achieved boosting both the ease AND security of Bitcoin for beginners. This feat is the unsung hero of bitcoin wallets.

You guys are in SD? You know one of the best bitcoin companies on earth is in your town. You should hook up with them! I'm sure they'd help you make a heavy impact helping the community with bitcoin in SD. Reach out to them, they're really good about replying to any emails.

Yeah, this is hilarious. How is this spam?

You know what's spammy? Running a downvote campaign on relevant bitcoin content and getting mods to remove a perfectly topical and popular post.

How is it Airbitz's fault if a company goes out of business or stops accepting BTC? Their directory is all hand curated, and they have 19,000+ listings. Did you email their support or whatever? 
It's by far the most accurate and up to date bitcoin directory still.
