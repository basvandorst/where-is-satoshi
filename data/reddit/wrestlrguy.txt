Dood you gotta stop the hyperbole.  The entire US government really?  You do realize he's not a dictator right?  I'm also hoping you never have to know what actual fascism looks like.

Why would you attack someone political for something non political.  Great way to alienate people.  The Trump bad Trump stupid thing is tired and old and proven to not do anyone any good on any part of the spectrum.

I'm well reed.
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:05:02
My point was just that stable and constant are two separate things.

To be fair there was about 6 months of warning if your head wasnt buried in the sand.  So if you stayed you at least heard a rumor.  In my mind most people who got caught with their pants at their ankles it was because greed not heeding the warnings or ignorance, which may be worse because then you really just threw your money out there.
In summary yes in general you can blame the victim here because you got smashed and took the shortcut through the alleyway in the red light district on your way home.  You arent a POS like karpeles but you are in part to blame.
P.S.  There are other circumstances im sure where the above isnt true for everyone, there are always outliers and you mighr be one of them.  Im generalizing here.

The point I'm currently arguing has nothing to do with bitcoin.  It's that if you are holding paper gold with the hopes of ever wanting to use it in any irregular scenario you deserve to be robbed.  Otherwise go ahead and go paper for a reasonably safe investment in normal times.

I guess theres really two bitcoin camps now.  The more libertarian wild west camp who realize the dangers and the personal responsibility of utilizing a nascent technology and the people who think its a cool new currency and can appreciate some of the future benefits.
Im more in the former camp and to me its very much like reloading ammunition.  You can save money and fine tune your ammo for your gun at the same time, but if you arent careful and dont know what you are doing you could load a double charge and blow up your gun aka lose all of your bitcoins.  Due to the legal system and reliability of factory self defense ammo people are still recommended to use factory ammo for self defense of course with the option to do otherwise but at your own risk.
So be cautious with your bitcoins and keep your own damn private keys.  If you dont know what a private key is, then consider it gambling and dont put in what you arent afraid to lose.

Live boot cds work perfectly.  You dont have to install ubuntu.  The only issue is make sure the printer never sees the internet again.

When one considers how bitcoin mining works, there is a thing called difficulty.

Botnet doesnt need to take over your wallet.  There would be a great motivation for someone to make a botnet to mine using the infected computers.
Not really sure where you are going with this.  Just saying there are positives and negatives to both.  ASICS will decrease in price making the barrier to entry a lot lower.

Couldn there be a single pool who merely splits up their hashrate?

A somewhat centralized mining environment actually protects against a botnet, just saying.

But that changes the numbers you are being fed regardless
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:35:14
I would also like to state the median income in 1966 was ~$7k meaning you were either rich or saved a solid percent of your income.  Im not saying you are completely insane and wrong, but its a little more complicated than that.  And also look to the future, how much will 500k be worth in real buying power in 50 years?
You should obviously save but these napkin calculations that are done in mickey mouse economics pamphlets regurgitated by financial planners arent reality.

Bitcoin could fail.  Blockchain tech could still be successful but not through butcoin you do realize that right?

That fraud insurance is costing you ~1% on nearly all purchases.  The company you are buying from adds that fraud insurance they pay into the cost of their products and services. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:00:42
and thats different from traditional banking how?

Most people are stupid or don't want to spend the extra brain power to pay attention.
Do you pay the escrow service even if you don't have an issue?

Until you send it to the wrong address, or you never get the package you bought delivered.  It's just not for old people.

Yes, stealing credit card numbers is considered fraud.
Credit cards are much easier and better for people who want to pay for that insurance.  Bitcoin at least gives you the option to waive a solid portion of that insurance.

No, even better would be to have companies pledge to accept a digital currency with a public ledger.  And encryption

you may not be paying them directly but that 1% should be higher, so technically you are.  Go with a deflationary currency like Bitcoin!
