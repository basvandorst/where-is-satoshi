I've used Jaxx to hold small amounts for over two years with no issue at all.
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:23:38
In hindsight I wish I'd bought at $3150.
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:46:39
Have any of you guys used this yet? UK here so I can't try it for myself.
@_date: 2019-07-05 22:23:13
Technically no investment is a safe buy, but that is just debating semantics &amp; I have no interest in doing that.
@_date: 2019-07-03 09:16:31
Where were they stored?
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:40:58
If that's true, fair play. It was too risky for me at that point, I'd had me eye on buying back in at $6k since December.
@_date: 2019-07-05 17:58:17
Honestly, if I wasn't already invested I'd wait for a break above $14k.
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:23:05
True,  I'm always happy to take the safer option with my investments.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:12:38
My first thought too.
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:52:51
I wouldn't disagree with that, but the guy asked for an opinion at what price  I would consider Bitcoin to be a "safe buy". Until this drop has finished the only safe buy I can see right now would be a break above the local high. My opinion will probably change if we see clear reversal but that hasn't happened yet.
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:14:26
The safe buy was the breakout at $6k.
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:27:50
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:38:00
Most alt investors won't accept this until Bitcoin drops to sub 5k &amp; the majority of alts  drop to to even lower levels than early February. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:51:21
Every chance, hope it doesn't though, not going to sell mine either way.
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:05:15

@_date: 2018-05-30 00:48:31
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:31:26
Sub 5k, that's where it is going.
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:11:48
I agree, don't get me wrong I'd love for this support to hold, just saying that it might not.
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:14:36
Hopefully, could easily drop to $4.5k - $5k first though.
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:40:43
Well said.
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:20:35
It's a joke on a meme post, for god sakes don't take it so seriously.
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:23:10
That's the joke I was referring to, calm down man. A meme post is not the place to discuss the merits of alt coins.
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:27:35
TIL - Do not make jokes about alt coins being shit coins on Reddit because bag holders get angry &amp; downvote you, even on a meme post.
@_date: 2019-03-21 04:52:31
I love that Krown pops up inviting Jack onto his show.
@_date: 2019-03-18 07:45:56
1BTC, 21BTC would put you in the 1 million club.
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:04:50
Any sensible person keeps them locked away &amp; not with the wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-16 07:28:37
It's just a shot of alt coins, don't take it seriously. But yes, they are all shit coins.
@_date: 2019-03-09 06:24:09
You could recover it with your private keys or seed.
@_date: 2019-03-16 02:30:04
It's just a shot of alt coins, don't take it seriously.

If I was spending my own money, I'd take an R8 over a Lambo.
@_date: 2019-03-01 04:06:34
Rekt is the correct answer.
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:31:12
It's an informal term for an informal post.
@_date: 2018-10-17 21:21:49
My thoughts exactly, all the American indexes have actually had a decent bounce off the current trend line.
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:58:24
If it was because inflation, Gold would be going up too.
@_date: 2019-08-18 13:02:55
Less than $2k.
@_date: 2019-10-16 03:35:47
I'm not a fan of Vays but I like that trolls Wright.
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:56:34
If I had to guess I would say around two &amp; half years, sometime during Q3/Q4 2021.
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:33:37
Still hodling your Doge I see.
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:11:41
Greater decentralization &amp; a far greater following.
@_date: 2019-04-19 11:23:34
Install a wallet &amp; store Bitcoin in your fridge!
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:16:11
I think you are missing my point, what you describe is not a correlation, it is a similarity. A correlation means there is a relationship, one affecting the other or being effected by a mutual third party. 
Clearly there is a similar pattern here, no one would disagree with that.
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:20:12
Not even years, decades.
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:10:10
Print a paper wallet &amp; use that.
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:26:58
My thoughts exactly, a lot of smaller miners means greater decentralization &amp; is much more beneficial to the eco-system than the huge mining farms.
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:20:22
Good time to buy, welcome to the party.
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:05:38
No worries. I do like the similarity too, it could be interesting with a few more examples.
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:40:25
Traders taking profit.
@_date: 2019-01-19 15:53:44
This chart isn't even showing a potential correlation, it is simply showing similar price action. Correlation would have to at least be in a similar date range.
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:02:55
Look up  on twitter.
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:00:57
Could happen but even if it does I'd expect a sell off &amp; return to the 3k mark again before any real growth.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:30:01
I've used Jaxx for small amounts for well over two years with no issues, this sounds to me like you just didn't back up your wallet properly.
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:16:36
I think something along these lines is very likely, I still think we will a drop to about $5k first.
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:10:32
If they can survive the next twelve months they should be okay, we should start seeing large growth again in the build up to the halving which should be around May 2020.
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:45:27
I think you jumping to conclusions about the intention of this, the point of the post isn't to suggest what has happened before will happen again based on a few similarities. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:13:41
To share a similarity that I noticed &amp; to potentially have a discussion about it, I left the post vague as to avoid making price predictions as that was not my intention. 
That's actually a valid point, maybe I would have been better off just writing the post, asking for opinions &amp; creating discussion from there.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:20:41
Exactly, I'm fairly certain that cycle revolves around the halvings.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:43:46
Okay cool, the XD at the end of your comment made it seem a little sarcastic. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:18:32
I, like a lot of us here, am willing to go down with the ship.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:31:57
What's your issue with the RNG? It's worked well for me.
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:49:16
If your parents are okay with it, why not? I'm sure you'll learn some valuable lessons no matter the outcome.
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:56:57
Next year, I meant end of next year.
