Wow that's terrible. Don't even think about giving some to them.

I'm talking about exactly that. Whatever, do as you want.

Some people have bank accounts in other countries, so they buy Bitcoin and sell it in Argentina for a bit more, eg: "mtgox high +5%"

To everyone here: Could this have been prevented just by using Armory and an offline wallet?

Cryptography is a science on its own, an entire discipline, like Math. Secure cryptographic algorithms are not intuitive, and usually cannot be created overnight by any single person (and certainly not by someone who isn't an expert in the field), they need to pass the test of time (survive hack attempts over decades, with a lot to gain). What you did is insecure, one does not simply cut cryptographic keys in halves, share them, and make assumptions like "they will be just as secure as the original".
Other redditors suggested you use something like Passguardian. Personally, I'm only hearing about it right now, but it's probably a better choice than rolling your own scheme (just make sure to use it offline, you can save the page in a .html file).
Another option is waiting until Armory adds the n-of-m feature, which I've been told is coming soon. There you will have everything in the same program.

I have never visited this site, so I wanted to check it out. This is what I got:
Good luck with your business.

Just use Armory! It lets you create transactions in the online computer, put them into a USB, and sign them with the offline computer.

It seems to me like the problem is people is using all kinds of apps without even knowing whether they are trustworthy or how to use them correctly. I don't think Bitcoin can do anything about it. Imagine someone offered you an app to manage your bank account. Would you jump into it just because it looks cool?
Personally, I only know about Bitcoin-qt and Armory. But in this thread I feel like people is doing all kinds of crazy things with their wallets and the block chain.

You could create encrypted copies and give them to friends or bury them in many places. That way, you only need to find one of those copies and remember the password you used to encrypt them. If you think you can forget the password, you could also have an unecrypted copy stored in your house. Just make sure you periodically check the integrity of that scheme. Ie: check that you remember the password and that the unencrypted copy still exists. Another option is to use passguardian to create an n-of-m scheme. That way you could for instance have 3 parts, give 2 to your friends and you keep the other one, and set the threshold to 3. So if you forget the password, you just gather the 3 pieces. If your house burns, you just need to find one of the encrypted copies and remember the password. If your house burns and you forget the password you are f***ed, but that would be very unfortunate. I've been told Armory is gonna add the n-of-m feature, that will make it easier than using passguardian.

Why not Armory?
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:49:08
Dude, don't do that. Use a well tested algorithm. That's kind of the first rule of cryptography.

Why has this been downvoted? I too think Armory is the way to go.
