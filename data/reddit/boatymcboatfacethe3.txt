I’m from uk and I don’t know anyone in my circle of friends and associates who have bought or even would consider buying Bitcoin.
In fact during our discussions they still think I’m a crackpot for investing, lol. What do they know?

Im hoping to hodl onto mine for the next 13-15 years until I retire. At which point I will cash out to enjoy my retirement in full.
Of course I will keep a close eye on the price and regularly put a percentage of my savings into both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
