If you actually understood the consensus process, you'd know **a banking cartel on Ripple could never do as much damage to the network as a mining cartel (GHash, etc) on Bitcoin** or any mined coin. 
And now that Ripple runs a non-plurality of validation servers, even they have limited censorship abilities.

No, what's objectively false is pretending that every other exchange, decentralized or not, is doing anything different. 
**If you are not issuing the currency on the network, it ALWAYS AND ONLY represents a 'credit' or debt.** So unless we're talking about Counterparty, Ripple IOUs are the same as any other exchange's assets, only better because they ripple between eachother.

How is it practically useless? Trading on trust is not only more reflexive than hard currency, but it doesn't even require printing currency from a single source. You can either have no trust and no reflexivity like with bitcoin (which has its strengths), or you can have pure reflexivity while distributing the trust among so many parties that the only real danger is collusion (which also has its strengths).

2 things
1: provide a mechanism for them to trade against each other automatically (the holy grail we know as **decentralized exchange**)
2: rippling (which is optional); allows same denomination colored coins/IOUs be swapped so that **you can spend the currency you have and the merchant can accept the currency they want**
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:57:44
Except for the fact that the price mechanism becomes obsolete when the unit of account fluctuates in value. It would be as if inches and feet changed value depending on the supply of rulers. 
Don't get me wrong, you're explanation of the price mechanism is spot on, I just think that it breaks down when the price of money changes, not that I'm advocating central banking or magic algorithms.

Inb4 "ripple is a scam" posts:
If anyone in this sub was actually capable of analyzing how Ripple/stellar works, they'd tell you it was the first decentralized exchange that has the greatest liquidity of any exchange b/c of its rippling capability.
But since there isn't, you'll hear a lot of 'ripple is centralized' or whatever.
IMO, Stellar, which is a Ripple reboot by the original creator, is a lot better with a lot friendlier and open-minded community. Come to stellartalk.org!

You must be really high because you just described the whole point of Ripple, got to people to like the idea, all in r/bitcoin! 
Seriously though, sans the actions of Ripple Labs, this is why the ripple software is really so innovative. Now if we could only come together to create a new ledger with a more equitable distribution scheme, say, where 90% goes to the community for BOINC contributions and the other 10% is held by a nonprofit to spur commercial development and adoption...
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:32:41

Bitstamp has been using Ripple as an optional backend for their currency exchange since before Ripple was open-sourced, Kraken trades XRP and might also do the same as Bitstamp, but I don't do currency exchange so I'm not up to date with that info.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:49:00


But again you're mis-attributing blame to currency being trust-based, rather than one-party trust-based (aka centralized trust) where the blame really lies.


Process: pretty much as the example states; I trust Sean's Outpost for $20. B/c I am an employee of Walgreens, they will let me spend as much as a $20 advance on my paycheck (aka they trust me for $20). Sean's Outpost now has a way to spend $20 at Walgreen's, without there existing any explicit trust between them (only through me). Now instead of there being only one trusted party, I can distribute that trust among 20 nonprofits, and my hundred fb friends can trust me and others for a few bucks here and there. pretty soon everyone on earth is connected to everyone else in 6 degrees or less (only through who they trust my end you), without a single dollar being printed.
As far as proof goes, look at Ripple pay, which is an early incarnation of the ripple concept and is still in use by a few hundred people today. I'm sure there would be plenty more if more people did their research rather than circle jerking their ripple hate.
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:16:21
Recently, Ripple Labs has all but said they want to integrate with banks over (what i would assume) more community-oriented integration. They've also been stingy with the XRP distribution. 
But the tech is open source and IMO more interesting since it allows for p2p credit and higher-liquidity decentralized exchange than others. It was forked and rebooted into Stellar, which I think is a lot better.
@_date: 2014-07-17 02:48:10
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:21:24
Faster txn speed.
Greater liquidity than any other decentralized exchange.
Potential for p2p currency issuance where they can all trade against each other on the network automatically.
Consensus instead of mining. 
Like the other user said, its really complementary to bitcoin as opposed to replacing it. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:23:26
... Except transact with other servers out of the box. With a distributed server protocol and some client-side additions to do the rippling, OT could potentially do everything Ripple does. 
But then you'd need users to pay server fees with some kind of token thats accepted by all or most of the servers, which would be either a p2p currency like BTC (which users would have to be gifted or bought from miners/early adopters) or an issued currency (which users would have to be gifted or bought from issuers/early adopters).... 
So why do we keep repeating that Ripple is a scam again? Because the developers who wrote the software, built the network, got established exchanges onboard and got the VC money don't wanna give away 100% of what they have to show for their work?
I just really don't understand how having beastly ass graphics cards and ASICs is a more fair distribution scheme than just asking FOR FREE or doing distributed computing for Ripples to use (since theyre not even the interesting part about Ripple)

B/c that's debt you had no say in creating yet were forced to subsidize. Debt isn't bad in and of itself; debt to unaccountable parties with hidden stipulations is bad. I mean the first monies on Earth were more like p2p credits between members of a tribe than they were trustless hard currencies like gold.
Bitcoin let's you create currency based on cryptographic proof of work. Ripple let's anyone create currency based on *real* proof of work (as in, you built a spaceship/fed the poor/etc, so here's some currency you can spend on me or through me to others who have trusted me and the work I've created).

Yes, but adopted for what reason (the author doesn't make this clear either, at least not in the abstract)? Primarily as a store of value or as a medium of exchange? A crypto"currency" can do both, but will likely do one better than the other. 
Would you really disagree with the idea that a price-stable crypto currency would be better for exchange than bitcoin, all other, technical things being equal? 
@_date: 2014-07-17 02:55:45
What you're describing (hoarding) would be deflation, too little money chasing the same goods, thus the prices fall. It's not the shocks that I'm worried about, its the idea that inflation is better than deflation, or vice versa. I think what needs to be explored further is money as a fixed unit in time with supply that fluctuates in accordance with demand. As for how, don't ask me yet hah.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:47:38
You should use Stellar, it's a fork of Ripple run by a non-profit with 5% pre-mine.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:04:26
I thought I did elaborate but let me try again... Prices can change in one of two ways: If fish get cheaper, maybe because there's more fish, its price changes relative to other goods, in this case, price deflation.
Method  If money becomes scarce, regardless of what's happening to other goods, its value increases relative to its value in a previous time period, aka monetary deflation (prices for all goods decrease). 
They are two very separate reasons for a change in price and the original point of an 'algorithm to modify the money supply' is to suggest that the price mechanism becomes less useful when the unit itself (in addition to what its measuring) is changing in value. 
How can I objectively weigh something in pounds when the pound itself is changing in value?  If such a mechanism could be conceived to stabilize the unit of account, then it would operate like any other unit of measurement, which would surely be preferable to volatility , would it not?

The Future of Money by Bernard Lietaer is a good book covering the history of money as well as different attempts at local and complimentary currencies. 
Debt The First 5000 Years by David Graeber explains how anthropological studies suggest that credit money was the first money in existence, even before gold and other hard currencies. 
Thomas Greco is also big in the community/complimentary currency world and has a few books worth reading. But I'd recommend anything by Bernard Lietaer before anything else.

No you're right about the latter two options. My point was about going through the trouble of doing the second when it's return is so little and un-promised, but if you can bear the fees (and get your money into BTC fast), then there's no reason why you shouldn't do the second.

[This]( link on the Bitcoin wiki describes changes to the Bitcoin source that would require a "hard" fork of the software (the change would break compatibility between old and new versions of the software, requiring that **everyone** in the community switch over). In it they describe lamport signatures, which are a quantum-proof signature scheme based solely on hash functions and hash trees that could be implemented today (if not for the higher bandwidth and storage overhead). 
Basically, they have plans to implement quantum-proof signature schemes in the future, but unfortunately, only after not having it becomes a problem. Everyday that passes makes the switch that much harder to implement without mess IMO, but on the other hand, the only two signature schemes I know of are lamport sigs and NTRU, the latter of which is relatively untested.

Again, wrong in your first sentence. I never said, suggested or advocated anything remotely keynesian or involving centralized Planning. Look up mutual credit on wikipedia. The differences between the mutual credit and the dollar are 1) when dollars are created, they affect everyone using dollars and 2) they're created by a small group of people granted the privilege. 
Money on demand is created by everyone who uses it, only in amounts acceptable to the immediate recipient, increasing the entire systems utility and liquidity but minimizing and localizing the global effects of its creation. If you don't want to accept my currency, then don't. Others who trust that I can make real wealth to back the currency Ive just created can and will. This is how money was created back when we created civilization, as a representation of human trust and productivity, not some  sterile thing of artificial value and utility like gold and bitcoin. Believe me, I hold bitcoin precisely because it's scarce and will increase in value, but there's no doubt in my mind that it will never stabilize in value long enough for it to be a dominant form of a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:45:29
Ugh, you should really *read* things instead of assuming you know everything. Yes, if we operated under your biased and half-assed and half-baked, sarcastic system of credit, then you could extend unlimited amounts to anyone. Or if we operated under the current monopolistic system of credit, then yes, banks could extend unlimited amounts to anyone who would be forced to accept it. But maybe, just maybe, there's another way? (Btw, there is and it's called Ripple, but of course, its just a scam right? Definitely not worth looking into right?)
Seriously, google mutual credit, since that's what I'm talking about and something you clearly have never heard of, which would explain why you assume all debt is bad and evil. Do or don't, I don't care; I'd bet all my BTC you're not gonna tell me something I haven't read or heard before so I'm done here.

BitStamp is one, but theyre requiring KYC even for ripple trust lines now.

@_date: 2013-10-06 21:50:39
Authentication, right. However, IIRC, the way CJDNS is designed is such that the public key can be derived from the IPv6 address you are trying to reach, which is then used to authenticate packets received from them. Like SSL, end-to-end privacy and authentication are built here hand-in-hand. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:51:24
Only the derivation of the private key from the address is protected from quantum computing. Once you make a txn, you publish your public key. Quantum computing would allow someone to brute-force ECDSA, revealing the private key for any given public key, allowing someone to forge txns on your behalf. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:57:34
Dude, you really ought to learn how to read what people are writing vs reading hat you want to see. Who ever said anything about force?

Mine is better at exchanging value, Bitcoin is better at storing it. Period. Use what you want. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:30:43


I don't think that's right. ECDSA uses elliptic curves and is not quantum resistant. SHA-256, symmetric algorithms and other hash functions are quantum-immune.
If I understand correctly, this would mean deriving a private key from an address would be difficult/impossible, but deriving a private key from a public key would be possible with quantum computers using Shor's algorithm. Also, Grover's speeds up cracking symmetric ciphers, but can be mitigated against by increasing key sizes. [Source]( Did I get that right?
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:52:40

Ripple is decentralized, not only distributed. It's not as out-of-the-box p2p as bitcoin. You have to use a JS browser wallet with the rippled daemon instead of just one app like BTC-Qt. 
Complaining about one ledger == complaining about one blockchain, which is a non issue since you can open source it and start your own ledger. 
No service on Earth allows you to actually "send" money (except for BTC). You can only send digital representations of money (Bank of America $, MtGox $, Coinbase $) until you withdraw for physical cash. Ripple takes this concept to its logical conclusion (use money as a unit of value (like inches or feet) and create your own "money" backed by trust and other people's willingness to accept it). 
Everything else is specific to how you use it (trusting two gateways and money swapping between them). If you know what you're doing, then there are no problems; it's concept of what money "is" is just different than what BTC has going. 
The way he scammed people was to have you accept his BTC credit (adding a trust line) and then one unit of his credit. If you had a trust line to Bitstamp or another exchange, he could exchange his credit for Bitstamps *in your wallet* (which you implicitly agreed to when you extended trust and then accepted their credit), leaving you with his worthless credit. 
Lesson: don't extend trust on Ripple to ppl you don't trust IRL, which should be obvious. But apparently it's not, which makes it a scam.

I think that's exactly what you and the other ripple haters should start with next time.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:26:11
You ripplescam.org-loving morons realize that BTC you have in Mastercoin/Colored Coins/Open Transactions/any exchange whatsoever is also not "real" bitcoin too right? 
What makes Ripple a step up from all that is you could, say, trade MtGox BTC for BitStamp or BTC-e BTC as arbitrage or when one exchange crashes. 
edit: I don't blame you for laughing at the guy; you shouldn't put down money on a tech you barely understand, but considering that most ppl in this sub don't understand it either, you guys should keep the hating to something you do understand (like BFL and Coinvalidation).
@_date: 2013-10-05 00:14:56
Well, since extra BTC can't be created, I think (keyword think since I don't if what I'm suggesting would work) it'd make a decent standardized unit of account (denominational unit).
So you could have BTC circulating as it would, being deflationary as it would; however, the deflation would be offset by the inflationary forces inherent to potential over-issuance of credit. So (in my head at least) you could have an BTC-denominated economy with BTC credits as the medium of exchange, but have all the freedoms associated with a free credit economy. And since Ripple lets you choose whose credit you accept and to what amount, you could choose your exposure to default (and inflation) risk while not being tied to a deflationary currency as you would if you solely used BTC as the medium of exchange. I know it borders on insanity, but I can't think of a verifiable reason why the deflationary forces of BTC and inflationary forces of free credit wouldn't cancel eachother out. It's the first I've heard of something along these lines which either means it's bunk or I'm ahead of the curve...
You could then go further and withdraw a portion of your credits earned in actual BTC for censorship- and inflation-resistant savings.
I dunno, just some random thoughts that occurred to me. This also ignores all the other useful features that the BTC blockchain could implement, like colored coins (which would do what Ripple and OT already do), permanent asset declaration (which OT can do) and others I can't think of right now. 
I mean money is human, it was originally created as credit at the birth of society and civilization to facilitate trade so to peg our economy **solely** to something as unresponsive and unreflexive as BTC or gold is to ignore why we invented money in the first place. BTC has value as something that can't be forged but mutual credit has value as something that allows me to trade (which BTC can do but its not it's primary purpose). 
also: Thanks for at least reading and entertaining what I have to say instead of downvoting away anytime you see the word "Ripple" as most in the subreddit have been Pavlovian-trained to do. I guess once you get 50k subs the hivemind takes over.

1) Wrong, its open source. They may be running a majority of servers, but so was Satoshi at one point. Secondly, if you don't like their XRP distribution scheme (as many didn't like Satoshis), you can fork it.
2) Don't know what that means
3) I'm sure the bullshit floating in this subreddit has nothing to do with that, not to mention they are still receiving plenty of VC funding.
4) Don't see how since you can fork it. Its as much ripe for corruption as Bitcoin and the Bitcoin foundation. 
5) Then clearly you don't know how different Ripple is from Bitcoin. Bitcoin is trustless money, Ripple is p2p-trust money. If you can't see the difference, then it's no wonder you keep blindly repeating some scammer's words.

I hope you can understand my anger, its the same you feel when ppl call Bitcoin a ponzi scheme, which only exemplifies how little they know about Bitcoin and ponzi schemes. Buts let's begin:


As much as the Bitcoin devs. Don't like their distribution scheme or the code they include? Fork it.


One: miners are in control and if they collude to block txns from certain addresses they can. Two: the consensus algorithm allows you to pick and choose what you think are legitimate txns (assuming you become a validator); if you're choices are not agreed upon, then you can still publish your choices of txns, they just may not be accepted into the bigger ledger (which is ok if you want to run a local network, bad if you want to interact with the rest of the network). Bitcoin doesnt even afford you this in the blockchain.


Duh, that's always been the point (though any user who accepts them sets a maximum amount that they will hold). Debt in this system (known historically as mutual credit) was the first monetary system in place, even before commodity currencies and barter, invented alongside civilization as we know it (a modern example being Hawala). If you don't trust someone, don't accept their credit and don't extend them trust (like some scammed did with TradeFortress). 


Looked it up and I'm still unsure if it's correct, but it might be. According to their wiki, here's why: "The goal is to ensure everyone who provides a service can make money and to ensure that people wind up getting what they actually want just by the system finding the lowest-cost paths."
All that being said though, when you can trust any of 7 billion people or of potentially tens or hundreds of gateways, why would you choose the one that charges to hold their IOUs? 
And all this ignores the fact that the author of the site preyed on the ignorance of a few Ripple users with connections to Bitstamp, scamming them out of their BTC holdings, and his own users of his hosted BTC wallet to the amount of 4000 BTC while stating that he would not use the police to investigate nor refund users for the "theft" from his site. 
So take it all with a grain of salt. If you want to know why Ripple is as p2p as money can get, look up mutual credit on wikipedia. 
**edit:** I get the fee part now: when you pay a user that accepts an IOU that you hold, the issuer can claim a fee because without that IOU, the payment may not have been possible (thus providing liquidity to the network; I think it's only transferred if that's the only available payment path so if there are alternatives, it won't be sent and you won't be charged). 
Not saying it's right as I wouldn't appreciate it, though the logic makes sense and you can still opt to use it in a more p2p fashion without resorting to gateways; they exist to provide liquidity by making payments more seamless and with shorter paths. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:47:27
I mean the crux of that concern was the first point, but ok, here's my best explanation of the XRP usage: 
1) there is no way to trade one IOU in one currency for another unless the recipient will accept the one you are giving *and* you accept the one they're offering; thus, you use XRP as the "middleman" currency where you trade the IOU you hold to anyone who wants it, then trade the XRP to anyone offering the IOU you want.
2) without it, there's no way to know which accounts are legitimately trading legitimate IOUs (which could otherwise be created by extending trust lines to anyone and everyone, spamming the ledger) and which txns exist solely to spam the ledger. 
3) using this for spam prevention prevents millions of computers from burning thru dinosaurs just to produce useless hashes, only some of which complete the task. "Earning" XRP by having them given to you, to me, is as fair as getting the hardware and fossil fuel energy necessary to "earn" bitcoin, all without ridiculous carbon emissions.
I didn't like it at first that they hold most of them; then again, they put in the significant marketing and dev work into making it what it is and attracting Bitstamp and Kraken to use it and trade XRP and will presumably be getting banks to use it as part of their backends to get money into the system to trade BTC among other exchanges. Like it or not, banks are the only way to get big money into BTC. 
Also, Satoshi owns 10% (100 years from now, 5%) of all of them, which few seem to mind. And again, if you think it's unfair and can do without the established economy (like Litecoiners can do without the established Bitcoin economy), you can always fork it. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:59:10
But the difference is that the war on drugs keeps violent drug dealers afloat, while a war on bitcoin would scare away most legitimate merchants, reducing the economy to being used to buy drugs. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:31:54
You talk about Ripple and adopting a new master. Ripple is about making yourself the master of the money to make and accept. That's what it's been about for years, before these guys adopted it for currency exchange. I have no money in Ripple but a lot invested because Ripple represents money as it was before we used gold and credit, thousands of years ago.
You are not, nor have ever been a user. Gimme your ripple address to check your XRP balance if you're not full of shit.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:34:50
Yes it makes sense, but even today, ignoring that Federal Reserve money is debt, over 95% of money in circulation is created by extension of loans by commercial banks, which is what I would say constitutes a debt-based monetary system. But this is almost irrelevant to the OPs discussion so it's whatever to me.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:18:30
Good point. So what can Ripple Labs do to control "their" system since it's sooo centralized? Gives us a few examples since you know so much about how Ripple works. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 01:59:24


I would agree if not for the fact that ripple already has a baked in server-to-server protocol; all that's needed between the servers on a network would be consensus on the usage token-currency.
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:08:06
No to both, the first mistake being that you assume I'm talking about an actual currency as opposed to a balance of accounts. If you and I trade on a balance between each other, and you do the same with others who do the same with others, the limit on the amount of currency in the system is decided by the people who accept increases in yours or anyone else's balance. And since it's a balance thats being traded on vs a currency thats being traded, there's no hoarding.

If you're concerned about that Ripple will supplant Bitcoin, then you don't understand Ripple as a concept and its true differences from Bitcoin. 
1. **XRP are usage tokens** for the now-open OpenCoin-operated Ripple network. You can fork the software and start your own network with your own pre-mined usage tokens (exactly as you would with Open Transactions), **but if you want to use the original network (as well as all the gateways and users that are on it), you're gonna need XRP.** 
2. Ripple (originally, maybe OpenCoin has different plans) is about turning debt-money on its head and taking it to is logical conclusion. The world we live in was built on credit (whether it was backed by gold or by nothing) and that's because credit is reflexive to an economy's demands. The ONLY problem with our current system of credit is that it's legally monopolized. If credit could be created by anyone, than we could get all the benefits of credit (appropriate expansion of money supply in step with creation of wealth) without all of the centralized, legalized scamming that comes with monopolization. With freedom to choose between credit issuers comes the freedom to hedge your exposure to any one issuer (unless you don't care to trust an issuer, in which case use BTC). 
3. Deflation is not better than inflation, nor is inflation better than deflation. Both are subpar. **Price instability by no other reason than fluctuations in the money supply is plain fucking stupid.** Prices should reflect costs and desires for future earnings, not how much money is in circulation. (Ask yourself, is trade a means to an end, the end being acquisition of money, or is money a means to trade? If you believe in the latter (which is the right answer), then **why should prices fluctuate based on money supply and not solely based on the consequences actual trade of actual wealth**?)
4. Ripple allows people to issue credit denominated in USD, BTC or even in new denominational units, and then gives people the ability to set exchange rates and have balances "rippled" from user to user atomically. That means Amazon can issue Amazon coins and I can pay BTC-only stores with the coins I earned playing Angry Birds or whatever, all automatically. I can take part in a LETS (local exchange trading system) in my hometown and as long as there's an someone there invested in the LETS currency and another (like BTC, USD, ISK, TF hats, whatever), I can trade with those who will only accept the other.
tl;dr that doesn't mention what I wrote but sums it up nicely: **BTC is trustless money, Ripple allows for money based on trust.** Both will make up and define the cryptocoin climate and both are necessary for monetary reform/alternative finance/whatever freedoms you seek to get from crypto coins. 
edit: wow, I guess if you ripple-haters had anything productive to say, you'd say it instead of just downvoting. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:43:45
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:29:33
I think I understand your first sentence, and so the is answer is only partially yes. Inflation is a product of a free flowing currency growing faster than the wealth that it represents, leading to rising prices. 
For the second question, so yes, while there will be competitive currencies, calling them "inflating" suggests that the issuance happens irrespective of the wealth being represented; for example, if I was Elon Musk and I asked you to accept a billion of my $ for a yacht, you wouldn't consider it "inflating" my currency. If I was anyone else *and* you choose to accept it, then you are establishing equivalence between me and Elon Musk and again, you wouldn't consider it "inflation."
The end point I'm suggesting (though I can't prove it like we can't prove BTC deflation would be good or bad in the future) is that **since newly minted p2p money is voluntarily accepted** (rather than done in secret like fiat), **it's quite possible that its inflation-proof**, which I think is really interesting since no actual money, digital or physical, need actually change hands since instead we're just using open balances. 
Of course, if the wealth I have backing the money I mint is destroyed, then the balances I've established become worth less, but not necessarily worthless, which would suggest inflation. But even then, the inflation is localized to me and those who accepted my currency, no one else. You kinda see where I'm coming from now?
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:31:21
I agree but I'll condense it to what I think is the most effective anti-BTC strategy:
News media FUD + legal action = reduction of merchants + slower/stagnant/reversal? in adoption
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:50:11
From the wiki: an alternative currency in which the currency used in a transaction can be created at the time of the transaction. LETS are mutual credit systems. Typically this involves **keeping track of each individual's credit or debit balance.** Although the **effect is like a loan, no interest is charged,** and since mutual credit allows for trading and cancelling balances with others, debts can be paid off indirectly. The **"IOU" is a common example of this.**
God damn you're dense.

No but I thought that's what's being offered/given away. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:25:59


Here's what I've come up with while thinking about that same problem: 
The virtual dollars you speak of (I'll call them credits) have a value in that they can be redeemed for "real" fiat/BTC but also can be spent along the pathways as money itself. This would suggest that the credits themselves have a market value, either above or below the value of the denominational unit they represent. So when a gateway is running low on cash, he might charge more credit (plus his fee) for swapping out of the network for cash. At least that's what I'm thinking will happen.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:25:34
Ugh, you mean aside from the fact that you trash it while knowing nothing about it?
Well for one there are three domains of money: trustless (gold and bitcoin), one-party trust (like bank credit and fiat and to an extent Hawala), and then there's the **original form of money (as shown by anthropologists)**, used even before barter and precious metals called multi-party trust money; its known among monetary reform circles as [mutual credit]( 
The original Ripple was the first digital reinvention of mutual credit, and now that the software is p2p, it can really take off. Think about using a money that didn't change a market's prices of good because of its abundance or scarcity, because it was created on demand for the sole purpose of exchange. **Bitcoin will still be a great store of value (I mean its essentially digital property)**, but in principle, it can't touch digital mutual credit **in terms of utility in pure market exchange**. You can read the original paper by Ryan Fugger (the creator of Ripple) and others [here](

Debt has value, if you can trust it. It worked for thousands of years before mainstream use of commodity currencies, and can work even better now that you can link reputations to accounts. 
Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin has value (utility and based on scarcity), but trading debt between trusted parties can be non-inflationary or deflationary and is substantially more efficient. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:52:02


Imagine you trust your friends for a few hundred bucks, that is to say, you will let them spend a few hundred of their IOUs onto you for something you have before you demand something in return.
Now imagine that they have a group of friends, some in common and some that are not, with which they do the same thing.
 Multiply this across the entire population for whichever monetary denominational unit they think is the most stable and now you have a global network that **allows anyone to pay anyone in any currency without there ever having been a single issuing authority** (whether it be a central bank or a blockchain). P2P money-on-demand designed for facilitating trade while its absence doesn't hinder trade (since there being more money is as simple as trusting someone for the new amount). That's the point of it all.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:13:44
They're still growing more than they are being used or currency exchange. They just received a few million more in VC backing and have started to makes deals with existing MSBs and social lending clubs. No one uses a network no one uses, so the hype is bound to outweigh its use for a while.

I've been trying to wrap my head around how a p2p exchange would work so walk me through it: 
I buy, say, 1 BTCc (bitcoin-denominated credit) from a gateway. I want to sell it some time later for $. I find someone/some organization that sells cash $ that is geographically close to me and along a trust-path and then message them. We meet up, I give them the BTCc and they give me cash?
If this is the case, how is this any different from localbitcoins (aside from how Ripple has other monetary functions)?

Well all of those problems (fluctuations, determining exchange rates) can be eliminated or avoided altogether if most balances are denominated in the same unit;  their relative value is then decided by their relative rates of acceptance among the participants at large. even between units of account, there will always be big players who will exchange one for another.

Fair enough, but it starts with the original question I asked: under the assumption that money is created on demand/balances are created and shifted on demand (and voluntarily accepted under the presumption that the balance will tip in the other direction in the future), you could have a monetary system that operates without monetary inflation or deflation. 
If it were possible, would that not be better than a currency that whose scarcity or abundance influences prices?

Of course I do. My point is that the people that you think will defy government regulations of bitcoin by continuing to use it are the same people that don't know that they use encryption everyday (and would have no problem voting for laws banning it). 
The only thing I was pointing out is that your argument that "banning encryption didn't work therefore banning bitcoin won't work" is flawed since hardly anyone used encryption before it was to be banned (and almost as few consciously use it today). Likewise, the few people actually selling things in bitcoin are currently taking a risk (not only on its value but in the hopes that they're not doing anything illegal) and when that risk proves to be unprofitable (via regulation), they'll stop accepting it and there will go the legitimate bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:37:22
1. Just 'cause it's pre mined, does not automatically make it a scam. Mastercoin (to a point) is pre mined, Open-Transactions servers will require pre mined tokens; unless you're gonna use PoW (which burns dinosaurs like there's no tomorrow), the next fairest distribution scheme is just giving it away, and selling the rest to fund development (which is quite common).
2. They do talk about where they came from and their purpose: to act as the only 'real' value on the network by which all assets are traded against, and to provide a means of funding development. 
But I guess if everyone in this sub wasn't already sold on it being a scam, I wouldn't have to keep repeating this very obvious information.

The only point that any critic is trying to make is that there are many different ways of solving what Bitcoin can't do (namely, p2p credit and all of its applications). OT currently can't but has the capabilities of doing so, **and it wouldn't require an alt-coin**. That's the whole and only point. The fact that they likely know this and chose to ignore it is sketchy. That's the only concern. At this point in time, their actions are the only things that can redeem themselves. 
Turning a profit is not bad, designing the software to make the assets that only you hold the key to the software's success is just bad practice.

If you want to appreciate ripple like I do, read up on the original Ripple project by Ryan Fugger. Here's [one]( of the links I've found; you may have to use the wayback machine or something to find more. Ripple (the current one) can do everything the original can do (namely, mutual credit), but that concept is a bit hard to grasp, which is why I think they're focusing on currency exchange.

Well if you would read their wiki instead of ripplescam.org, you'd know how they prevent double spending.

Considering that you barely know what Ripple does, I'd gonna check... and confirm that you're wrong.

Ya "derp" is the most coherent criticism I've heard. Thanks for your contribution.

For someone who can do basic programming but still has little idea what you're talking about and isn't enrolled in a CS program, where I can learn these general dos and don'ts?

It was happening long before government was invented, and it is also the most liquid currency possible.

...except among those market participants who are known not to insider trade... In fact, they'd get all the business this insider trader isn't.

1) Except for the fact that he was paying people to talk trash (which is the opposite of a legitimate argument), ya I agree. 
2) Exactly. So stop turning a cheek to Bitcoin while seeing everything Ripple does as evidence of a scam (maybe not you in particular). 
3) XRP is necessary under the software; using OpenCoin's XRP vs creating your own is the alternative (like starting litecoin is your right). But since they've put in the leg work of getting SnapSwap and Bitstamp to accept it on *their* network, you're gonna have to use *their* tokens. If you ask me, they released the source code when they did b/c they wanted to be as big as possible before legitimate competition could get a start. But again, it doesn't matter since you can use your own. 
It is a "store of value", just as usage tokens for Loom or for an Open Transaction server are a "store of value." By definition, since they get destroyed with each txn and since you need them to communicate to the servers, each one is and becomes more valuable.


Sure, like DeBeers dumps diamonds on the market, dropping their value. This doesn't happen, and even if it does, it doesn't mean that they're a scam, just that it's a riskier currency exchange platform than starting your own. (When haven't we all said the same thing about MtGox or the like?)


Agreed.
