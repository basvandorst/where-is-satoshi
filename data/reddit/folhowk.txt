She's absolutely right, Bitcoin will not achieve mass adoption without women getting involved. I'd like to see less sleazy comments about women in Bitcoin.

This is great promotion, but it was cringe worthy how under informed they were about Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:11:40
I'm surprised bitcoins are actually being spent that frequently. I thought everyone was under a "hold" policy.
@_date: 2014-03-17 04:30:12
It sounds like he wants to start his own podcast. He could be promoting that.

More gold form the managing editor of Newsweek
My father is in engineer and doesn't know a damn thing about Bitcoin. I can't believe she is acting like the idea of a man in his 60's not knowing about Bitcoin is a ludicrous notion.
@_date: 2014-04-25 03:24:51
That's over a 1% fee, and even more if your sending less than the $900 maximum amount
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:30:05
There's no reason why you would ever pay more than the price of the item because bitcoins are divisible to 0.00000001
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:18:38
Why would we need regulation at the wallet level?
@_date: 2014-05-02 00:26:30
Bro, do you even bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:33:35
I highly recommend using Mintpal. Of all the altcoin exchanges I've found it to be the most professional and easy to use.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:32:38
Can the private key then be imported to any wallet or can it only be imported back to Coinbase?

@_date: 2014-03-27 15:30:55
The problem is that if you are a US citizen and conduct all your transactions in bitcoin and never touch fiat you are still required to pay capital gains any time you purchase something with bitcoins

@_date: 2014-02-23 22:31:14
Smart move by them embracing the technology instead of acting like it doesn't exist. Although if he really liked Bitcoin I imagine he would let people purchase it with PayPal.
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:09:50
Thank you very much.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:46:19
Bitcoin != Gox
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:24:47
The only reason anyone should be selling is if they intend to buy back in at a lower price because of people panic selling. The Bitcoin network is stronger than ever.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:17:03
Comment section points out once again that most people are very uneducated about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:30:31
It seems like he is sort of stuck in the old paradigm of needing a centralized authority in order to have trust in the currency.  Why would Google or Facebook creating their own currency be better than Bitcoin?

If you're in the U.S. Coinbase is the best place to go.

I think that might go over better with Dogecoin.  The shibes would eat that up
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:09:47
Same argument can be made for inflation. If you knew the dollar would be worth 50% of its current value in two months wouldn't you spend every dollar you have? As Bitcoin grows and volatility decreases the swings in value won't be as great.
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:12:20
Even more encouraging is the responses to the tweet seem positive.  Not your typical "scam" and "ponzi scheme" comments.
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:17:50
Bitcoin is only money when the government wants it to be. What a joke.

I never suggest my friends to start out buying 1 BTC. If they don't even realize that bitcoin is divisible they should only be purchasing a few mBTC anyways.

It's comical at this point that their website boasts "Trade with confidence"
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:17:49
I always offer my friends a few mBTC to play around with but they are never interested. They still see Bitcoin as magic Internet money.

Never understood the Infowars hatred of Bitcoin. I understand Jones preaches that globalists are out to enslave us, but I though the freedoms that Bitcoin allows would appeal to their audience

Sounds like Mark is trying to raise more fear. He needs to step down from the Bitcoin Foundation.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:38:19
Correct me if I'm wrong here but isn't this basically what Gox had been doing the past few weeks after they completely closed withdrawals.  They were simply hoping to gain enough money through transaction fees to pay off their debt.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:42:57
If bitcoin is property and not currency then is there any need for all the KYC and AML regulation of exchanges/ATMs? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:53:00
I'll donate once they officially accept it. Give them some more incentive to accept Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:15:59
The bit should not be the standard unit used because the standard transaction fee is greater than 1 bit.  Try explaining to someone that in order to send 1 bit they need to provide a 100 bit fee.

350 the bottom? Price has gone to 275 and is sitting at 350 currently with a long term bear trend behind it.  Pretty foolish to call this the bottom currently, I would not be surprised if we test 275 again.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:44:24
I wouldn't have even wasted a satoshi on this guy
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:37:50
How much of a fee is the ATM charging? That seems to be the problem with all these ATMs.  Paying a 5% fee for bitcoins is just absurd when there are other ways to get them for barely any fee.
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:08:25
Zeta is on the way. Sachs and Konen were right all along lol.

I know a lot of people in this sub like to hate on Coinbase but they have been instrumental in getting merchant adoption by helping them immediately convert BTC to fiat.

I bought in at a little over 800 and have since averaged down to a cost basis in the mid 600s.  I never intend on converting them into fiat.

Every bitcoin bubble has resulted in a new all-time high and has never busted below the pre-bubble ATH. If you look at the trends you will notice that we may never see Bitcoin prices this low again.

The redditor who went to Mt. Gox HQ to protest said that he asked them why they haven't done something like that to prove solvency and they told him it would be too much of a technical hassle.  If it's too difficult too prove solvency when the public is prepared to leave Gox and the exchange could completely fold then they are either completely incompetent or are unable to actually pay their debts
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:03:56

I also think there's a huge market for online sports betting. If you're in the U.S. you need to trust shady offshore sites with sensitive information.  It would be so much easier to use bitcoin which affords you more anonymity.

He's right, BTC is highly speculative at best and outright gambling at worst.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:53:18
People have tons of wallets with virtually no money in them though. This is a poor way to analyze the wealth distribution of Bitcoin.
