precisely. If you don't hold your keys, you hold IOU, not Bitcoin.

one step at a time, we'll get there soon enough :-)

If you used it, you can eavesdrop on their address to see their volume. It's pretty decent, especially compared to other ATMs in Singapore

Yes, but because Bitcoin can't be printed out of thin air, bank runs will happen sooner or later and expose insolvent banks. It's not nice event in the short-run, but it makes system more stable and stronger in the long run.
I wrote about it last year here:

This has been filmed in Singapore where this doesn't apply :-) But I feel your pain :-(

shit, thanks for warning. The load script wasn't 100% reliable and in rare cases caused some weird behavior you probably experienced. Hopefully this time it's OK

note, that I posted it there, but intentionally not in :-)

let's conclude he is a great economic historian :-))

To all saying there is no difference from stealing Bitcoin from smartphone/computer. There's one massive difference. The moment you hand over your credit card to physical or internet merchant, you hand over your secret key. That doesn't apply to Bitcoin, you keep your secret key only to yourself during transaction

Btw. if you miss something there, please suggest it :-)

BitcoinAverage combines major exchanges 
just click 'linear' to switch to log scale (I didn't find a way to put that in url)

Hi modus,
thanks for your questions :-)
- it's not an app, which makes it usable on iOS, which was the main reason behind creating it. 
- .59% is for Bitcoin transaction in premium account. Fiat conversion - once it is in place - will have slightly higher transaction fee, but still no more than 1%

What's so mixed about it? This is a guy who was overseeing Bernie Madoff for 8 years and now says "Bitcoin needs regulation to build the trust of the broader population". There's nothing mixed about it, it's pure cronyism

... and I was the first one to use it! :-))

I wouldn't be worried, you create new wallet anyway. But I wonder how much does it coincide with Roger Ver's experience with Mycelium Entropy:

Both have pros and cons. For those who don't have any gold, I recommend to start with physical. Allocated makes it easier to divide to small change if needed and you don't need to move it with you. Also you have to think about worst case scenario of economic and monetary collapse combined with fascist regime such as Great Depression and FDR (back then currency didn't collapse) and risk of your gold being confiscated. In such case you might want to have some stock in Switzerland or Singapore. I think when you have more, it makes more sense to have both physical and allocated as long as the company holding it for you is trustworthy and transparent, which QA is (to me anyway)

awesome, exactly what I was looking for, thanks!

the service used is  I'm just working a bit on improving it based on some feedback and bugs found.
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:23:11
just updated  you can try it out by donating to it :-)
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:32:45
sorry :-(
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:45:45
OK, I'll give it a shot, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:37:59
That could be one of the options, but I'm afraid it wouldn't solve my problem if the transaction broadcasted from customer's wallet takes minutes to get to my bitcoind. 
Btw. I'm facing this exact problem right now. I've sent a testing transaction from my Android wallet to this address:  and it's still not showing up in blockchain.info
