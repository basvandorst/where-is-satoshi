I think it's an advertising for another scam (bitcoin Venezuela?)

What is your wallet?
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:31:52
Why you stored 1200btc in binance? For what coin exhange you did?

You draw wrong channel

This is not power and should be fixed
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:24:53
Probably not. You need to update your wallet each 50 years XD

How you lost
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:06:23
It's all downside
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:50:12
Ask op theory on why a quantum computer wouldn't be fast enough to break key in short time! I explained enough mine. At least my theory possible right now with regular computers but op theory on "quantum computers couldn't break keys in short time" need more explain. What short time mean in quantum computing lol
If a world power access to such computing power could do anything to network by %51 attack because no other one have that weapon at the same time. And after attack there will be a least forks and falling in price, chaos and fear of use which will lead bitcoin to collapses. Of course I am sure this not happen in my life!

That wasn't electrum, people downloaded malware from unofficial site and lost their coins
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:16:57
It's simple,  do not see 'a' quantum computer mining but imagine that as a computing resource of network of miners. By providing more than 50% of the network's mining hashrate to a group of miners they can do attack
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:30:32
Confirm you are robot :|
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:41:22
Why don't? Attacker could double spend coins and don't need to break already made  private keys

Just import them and see howmuch money you have

Hodler in action
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:12:34
Well that is correct but how about a quantum computer %51 attack network? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:58:07
You may in bottom but I always preferred on top

DEFINITION of 51% Attack
51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain – usually bitcoin's, for which such an attack is still hypothetical – by a group of miners controlling more than 50% of the network's mining hashrate, or computing power. The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coins.
