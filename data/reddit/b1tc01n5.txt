Yup, I agree. I've held on to the for a while but decided to spend some.

Yup. The money shows up in your balance once they pay and you can either spend it or withdraw it to your bank account.

Localbitcoins is probably the best you'll find. You could find someone willing to sell for PayPal, but that's unlikely, as it's risky.

Happy Satoshi day :)

Congrats on the purchase :)

You would scan their QR code to send the bitcoins.

Also don't forget that bitcoin is still young and a very small percentage of people hold them.

All these physical QR codes I've been seeing a lot of lately are awesome. Makes me want to make my own, but I'm too lazy.

Tl;dr: Bitcoins &gt;

No problem, I bought a $250 Amazon card for roughly 0.289 BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:03:31
Congrats, I made my first Bitcoin purchase today.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:40:38
eBay sales?
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:09:35
You can either but stuff with it or save it. You're choice!
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:43:27
Nice, I need to think of a clever way to get free bitcoins from people, haha.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:11:22
Those are pretty cool, but not worth $20 each imo.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:12:08
No, because not enough places accept it for it to be a salary imo. I don't want my salary (for example) cut in half due to a crash, if I cash out the coins as soon as I get paid, then I might as well just take a check.

It's great seeing a lot of new places are starting to accept Bitcoin!
