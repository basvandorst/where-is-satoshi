I understand the scale is much different but I'm hopeful the same philosophy could maybe be applied. I don't know. Just trying to lighten the air a bit :)

This is what Poloniex did when they were hacked years ago when they first started out. Used something like 25% of fees and distributed that to all affected users proportionately. 
I know Polo gets kind of a lot of hate on this sub but that worked wonderfully!

One problem with a decentralized exchange is the on-ramp into crypto. Currently it looks like there has to be some sort of bank involved in the mix still unless you use something like LocalBitcoins/Myceleum Trader of course.
* However, here is a very intriguing project that is getting built on the Stellar network called **FairX**. It will act as a distributed on-ramp by teaming up with Anchors (banks, money transmitters, etc)
Crypto-to-crypto decentralized exchanges already exist. Check out these projects:
* NeoX (getting built on NEO, still pretty heavy in the works)
* Bancor (built on ethereum)
* Bitshares (its own platform, decentralized exchange with pegged assets)
Lots more of these exist, this is just off the top of my head

Caution: I believe polo could be freezing all non-verified accounts at the end of January '18. Let me see if I can find the page on their site; I'll make an edit.
Ok, so it looks like it's just for legacy accounts. Which includes me, and possibly you I made my account in 2014 I think. I'm currently siphoning all my funds from there right now. Also there is no exact date - they will publish the date Q1 2018

Well explain to me how it is easy to steal bitcoin? Oh wait, you're just talking out of your ass.
*edit* Ok I saw that you are basing this comment on people giving their bitcoin to custodial accounts on a web server, which are most likely large targets due to the public nature of the company's bitcoin business. Not to mention, internal thefts were quite likely and not proven false in most of these cases that you speak of.

Having 4600+ BTC in an online wallet. Top fucking notch guys they have there. Hahahahaha. Yeah either they are grossly negligent or it was an inside job.
It's a mining site for noobs anyway.

Lol fair enough argument

You mined 2 years ago - before ASICS and the reward was still 50 btc per block - and you only made a few cents?
For me the electricty is nothing. But to each their own.
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:19:56
The problem is that the ASIC miner technology is increasing at such a rapid pace that by the time you get your unit the ASIC producer will already be 'testing' the next batch that is 100x faster.
edit: That's not to say I agree with not mining at all. It is a great hobby! (just dont put your savings into an asic rig)

Does changetip support twitch yet? I didnt see it listed at  
If not they need to get on that asap. I know dogetipbot was very popular with streamers.

Please don't be this. Seahawks as a team would be huge. Maybe Sherman talked them into it.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:00:47
Litecoin and other scrypt algorithm coins can be mined efficiently on graphics cards. SHA mining basically requires ASIC at this point. And that is a big plus for scrypt coins.
If your average Joe can mine it easier maybe even with hardware they already own, it has a place.
@_date: 2014-05-06 12:29:43
I honestly think we could be looking at a Dishwasher slope for bitcoin. Adoption seems fairly slow.

Bundle: 
Store: 
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:59:33
Humble Bundle only temporarily stopped accepting bitcoin. It's back on as an option now for the Store and Bundles. There is a link at the bottom of the cart for 'Other payment options'.
However, I think it was some porn site that stopped accepting bitcoin and they claimed that having too many payment options actually turns consumers off. Can't remember what site... not even sure it was a porn site tbh.

I have Comcast and I couldn't find it in the On Demand thing. I looked for all movies by R. Also, was it free?
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:23:23
I would contact Coinbase immediately, maybe make a ticket. They might be able to tell you more about how they accessed your account at least.
I can't think of a way they could have gotten your 2FA's without some intense virus on your computer/phone - but I'm not a security expert.
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:12:10
Yep never had a problem with Electrum
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:55:29
:( Well, I know it's a hard lesson, but let it be a lesson learned to **hold your bitcoin private keys in your control**. Sorry to be harsh
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:29:22
I don't know. Satoshi had the foresight to not stick around as a public figure which I think is vital for a decentralized system like this. Look at the weird cultish following around Vitalik and Eth.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:48:08
No it will just be locked in today. There is a 2016 block period (2 weeks) before it is actually activated.
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:04:22
He is lying or something. Polo support tried to contact him and he deleted his post.
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:59:52
They arn't getting my bitcoins ;)
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:14:23
It's a wallet. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:15:19
Change all your passwords immediately. It's likely they hacked your email and removed your 2FA from coinbase. Do you have 2FA on your email?
Sadly the bitcoin is most likely lost. Sorry for your loss friend.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:10:16
Do you know if it's safe to make a transaction from the Ledger Nano S Bitcoin Cash wallet right now? Would I just be put in one of the first  blocks?
At work so I can't really investigate right now
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:11:48
The secure element in Ledger Nano S is the [ST31H320](
This is based on the [SC000]( an ARM Cortex-M cpu. Cortex-M implementations can include TrustZone but it looks like SC000 does not. For example, if you go look at the arm.com page for M-23 it has TrustZone slathered all over it.
edit: formatting
@_date: 2016-11-29 22:03:36
I'm by no means an expert lol but it's based on the [ST23YT66]( which uses an ST23 core not an ARM from what I can tell.
So I think you'd be immune to this specific attack
@_date: 2016-11-29 16:31:30
Just ordered a Ledger Nano S on their sale this past weekend! Can't wait to move my btc there.
edit: as noted below for the KeepKey (and Trezor), the Ledger Nano S also has an ARM Cortex-M CPU so should be unaffected by this.
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:40:10
Hmm good point. But obviously they were lacking opsec in more ways than one ;) so who knows lol
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:29:29

You are not wrong, but remember Bitcoin was likely being designed during this time frame.
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:01:39
The best way is to put your BTC up for loan on  (one of the biggest and most respected crypto exchanges)
You lend it to people who put up collateral for margin trading. If they go below their margin level they get margin called. There is very low risk in this type of lending. The main risk is the site getting hacked (similar to keeping it on coinbase)
Note: it will be a very small amount of interest, but some nonetheless
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:10:51
The markets already account for this. Check CoinMarketCap's market data:
The price is weighted. Notice how GDAX actually has one of the highest prices (bullish!) while Polo's BTC/USDT is weighted lower because 1 USDT is actually .9 USD.

I think he gets that it's an outdated system - the problem is that all the stores are still using it and we have no way to spend bitcoin there :(. If they had terminals that integrated bitpay or something we wouldn't even be having this discussion! Although from my understanding Bitwala is almost a consumer facing bitpay if you think about it?
P.S. love your username lmfao
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:30:46
Honestly, it sounds like *you* don't want micro payments.
You are arguing that Paypal keeping record of internal micro transfers is just as good as the blockchain, which introduces a requirement of trust in a third party.
You are saying that the improved functionality of micro payments is not worth mentioning when talking about Bitcoin. Just because the large commerce corporation example you mentioned would not take advantage of it, does not mean that individuals/companies/corporations that you did not consider would want micro payments.
Sweeping generalization is a fallacy.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:56:10
Can you explain this a bit more? I would google but I'm at work.
How long is the period until activation after lock-in? And Why?
@_date: 2016-07-28 19:38:25
Hmm to be fair, most local dealers don't accept BTC so they can't just go turn around and spend it on drugs/cigarettes/alcohol, like they could with a cash allowance. Plus as long as you are responsible with your Steam account, you get to keep all those games for life - and they still get to choose what to buy and learn about Bitcoin to boot :)
edit: words
@_date: 2016-07-21 19:33:31
Nothing really but they are actually holding your bitcoin for you (your bitcoin custodian so to speak). This means they could turn and run and take the coin (similar to Mt. Gox) and you would have no recourse.
Having the coins on a device that you control (yes they are actually stored on that device) NO ONE else can get them without access to the device and your password.
Edit: words
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:34:03
It doesn't support the bitcoin network though. It mines alt coins and auto-trades them for bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:33:08
Did you guys read the withdrawal fee description? Sounds shady as fuck.
"For example you deposit 100BTC in Bitcoinsand, and now you want to withdraw 60BTC, just send 0.06BTC."
