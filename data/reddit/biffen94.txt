I had (and have) the same problem. The payment gets denied ONLY when Im trying to deposit through my PC, but if I try it through my mobile (Android), then it goes through.  Same case with my brother who has a different bank. Maybe this will work for your friend too.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:34
Yeah, pulling my money out asap

My btc wallet is still above the bch wallet

Get back to that delusional subreddit of yours at r/btc. Scumbag.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:46:24
If you held any bitcoins at the time fork happened, you are entitled to Bitcoin God (what a stupid name). But let's say you have all your assest on coinbase, you will not get God added there. Coinbase need to have trust in the coin to add to their site etc, like Bcash.

ALDRI invester mer enn du kan tåle å tape. Hvis en BTC skulle bli verdt 0 kr, kan du fortsatt klare å betale ned lån osv? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:40:51
Sell and never look at bch ever again
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:42:05
Jesus fucking christ... Well, probably better than Bcash ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:15:31
Bought some at the dip few minutes ago :) FeelsGoodMan
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:58:55
What a cunt. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:31:11
Youtube it :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:35:04
If you call that a crash, I don't think crypto is for you
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:16:32
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:38:32
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:01
Bch will crash, and btc will see an ATH (hopefully)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:29
Sold all of my ltc and went all in at the dip. FeelsGoodMan
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:01:55
You can have btc stored on an cold wallet like nano ledger s (no internet connection) and still be entitled to it. Dosent matter where you store it. The information is on the blockchain, and that information says that you own/owned btc at that time etc
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:00:22
grow a pair
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:37:29
Enough for me to buy at the "crash", lool
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:30:17
Exodus for pc
@_date: 2018-08-19 07:46:09
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:37
Try to relax. Once it opens for sale of bch, it will crash and everyone will put it in btc. I think we will see an ATH of BTV within the next hours
@_date: 2019-11-30 19:03:01
What a nice gift to the community. Lovely done, fellas!
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:21:41
Sounds like a good plan! Good luck with the crypto and your trip! ��
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:24:13
How long does it usually take to send btc with 1sat/byte?

Ledger S or X
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:19:53
Too fucking funny ��
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:15:07
For sure gonna buy the Nano
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:41:43
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:04:04
Can you store multiple different coins in the same hardware wallet? Im a noob, sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:10:12
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:30:18
Like, take a picture with your phone, import it to your PC and then upload it to coinbase. That's what you've been doing?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:09:18
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:27:10
Upload ID from your phone...
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:51:30
Ledger Nano S!!
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:03:49
Oh fuck, so sorry man
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:58:21
It's super legit. Google and do some research :)

He got a content strike that unables him to upload videos for a week. He made all of his videos private to avoid more unjustified content strikes. So they were not deleted by YouTube, but it's fucked up anyways.
So what was the content strike for? And Im gonna quote DataDash:
"“Harmful content” on a video that in no way broke community guidelines and was upload months back. It was certainly coordinated by a group of some sort".
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:29:44
@_date: 2019-12-26 05:41:28
DataDash got all of his videos removed too
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:03:31
If you actually took some effort into reading the thread, you would know im not "spreading lies". Merry christmas to you too.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:13:06
Hoping we will break 4k
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:52:29
10 more days until I get my salary... Fuck me! The dip is probably over by then, but I hope it dips even further down ��
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:38:35
Make your parents buy for you, and transfer them to your wallet. I dont know where you live, but in Europe, Coinbase Pro is a good exchange with little fees.
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:53:29
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:08:11
I like this
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:09:52
Just YouTube it, there's alot of videos explaining your problem
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:11:16
I can relate
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:48:11
Sometimes Exodus can show a much higher/lower value in price. So, if it was displayed that you had $700 in value of BTC , you could in reality have alot less
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:30:00
Same my friend, same.
