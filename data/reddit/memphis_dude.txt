Feels like I've been stuck in the mud for weeks.

Yep,  I member picking up the red moneygram phone at CVS to authorize the transfer.

I think security risk is one reason for not increasing the block size.  Someone correct me if I am wrong.

This seems like an onion article headline.

Have patience. I've had a transaction take 10+ hours.

 Jesus,  is that a real picture or shopped?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:18:07
was that the lady that did that?
edit: nevermind, I think it was the dude that filmed this on his TV/computer.

 And just how in the world do you think they could put a stop to monero?

One thing I've wondered is if the seed words need to be in a specific order or if they can be in any random order when restoring a wallet?

I've got both and I do slightly prefer using my Trezor over the Nano.  Entering the pin seems to be a quicker experience with the Trezor. The nano does support more alts though,  which is the reason I got it.

you made this?
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:41:23
Man, that dude lived the dream didn't he?!?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:04:41
oh ok, so a bunch of people are about to sell once it hits $7,000ish, which will drive the price down.  Right?

noob question, what does the green mean, what does the orange mean?
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:12:25
just like that dude said, "when you wanna puke on your shoes in the morning, you buy."
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:17:12
after 9k, I think it's this one:

So their really gonna be cool with dudes whipping their cellphone cameras out and aiming them at their naked bodies? 
*"Oh yeah,  I'm totally sending you a tip babe,  and not just taking pictures of your tits and ass."*

What was the tweet?
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:17:52
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:16:45
but really what did it say?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:34:24
Ahhh, ok.  Now I understand,  thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:22:22
I'm not sure what the "100,000 bits" means at the top.   Is that really indicating that you have 100,000 bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:57:00
So it's supposed to have more zeroes than the 4 already in 50,000, but it won't hit 50,000 for another 1,000 years? I am confused.
