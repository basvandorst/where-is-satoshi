Sorry man, but you missed my point. After registering with basic things (ID, card) they allow you to make a buy of any coins they have, but when you're trying to withdraw they force you to send more of your personal data ( bank statement, self pic etc. ) without saying that in the first place. Otherwise you will loose your money. And that in my opinion is wrong and should not be allowed. Register with all required docs, and then allow anyone to purchase/transfer anything. Now I feel all they trying to get is more of my personal data, and I don't know if I'll get my money back.

I did. They are trying to force me to send them my pic with ID. I said no and asked three times for my money back. No replay.

I bet you have got something to do with that site Karol. Anyway, thx for the tip. I'm working in a bank kiddo and that's why I'm so fed up with that approach - we let you buy but we force you to give all we need when withdraw. Banking is quite simple - you give ALL details up front and then you get your money.
edit// just did a quick buy on binance - at the end of your transaction they ask you for an ID scan. Simple, straightforward. At the END, not ALLOW TO BUY AND THEN YOU'RE OURS. Anyway, take my money as a a tip linkkoin.

I'm saying - they shouldn't allow you to buy anything before checking all required docs! Otherwise it feels like a scam.
Btw. binance allow you to buy crypto directly on their platform by credit card.
