That is a link to the Express newspaper. A tabloid rag if ever there was one. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:34:19
Ah yeah, well far enough. My comment stands though.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:27:30
I'm sorry but this type of stuff is complete bullshit. Bitcoin IS massively overvalued, it could be that some hardcore regulation hits home and it takes 5-10 years for mass adoption to kick in and for the price to recover. Many people don't want to sit on a 5-10 year capital lock in. If you've made money on the recent gains and feel you don't want to risk them then selling is a perfectly sensible option. Don't be lead by the juvenile attitudes of many on this sub.

Is there still money to be made? I'm considering buying just one now, as an experiment. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:12:25
k point taken.

Do you think the coinbase 'vault' is safe?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:39:08
No really. What was that? I hope that had nothing to do with Tether.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:36:10
I tried to make a Kraken account today due to Coinbase not supporting a wide enough range of cryptos. Might wait a bit.
@_date: 2016-06-23 09:06:21
Geek :)
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:30:11
No, not at all. I've heard it said a lot. I just wasn't sure if the coinbase vault was a decent compromise.

Meh, why waste money on a bunch of shitty cars? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:51:09
Fewer language errors please.
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:55:31
And when does the regulation kick in?
@_date: 2019-06-06 07:11:15
It’s up 30% this month.....
@_date: 2018-11-03 19:47:08
Which bar?!
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:26:31
All fair points, but there is still a chance the whole thing will die.
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:21:04
Yeah, but Naseem Taleb is an idiot. Plus, the whole point of black swans is that they are unpredictable. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:17:04
Yep, think I just learned that.

Tone Vays says 7500 USD.
EDIT: Tone Vays was wrong.

Thiel can fuck off.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:45:06
I don't like that thought.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:41:55
I haven’t owned bitcoin in a while, I’m definitely buying back in once this shit is over.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:35:01
Cryptocurrency probably will, not so sure about Bitcoin anymore. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:09:46
Heh, yeah, I guess I’ll have to do something similar.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:45:06
I don't like that thought.
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:10:36
What about Circle? What I want to know is whether there is any significant difference between these services given I only want to dabble at the moment? I would consider buying around 1 BTC and just seeing what happens to it. However, whatever I read about the various platforms is usually mixed. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:16:58
A successful brand has to be associated with something. At the moment even savvy users barely understand the tech or its implications. If it crashes hard, which it could, the brand could be irreparably damaged. At which point there are plenty of potential replacements with better conceived tech waiting in the wings. Bitcoin doesn’t actually do anything other than transact, unlike Etherium or Iota for example, and value storage is a potential feature of any valuable commodity. Regardless of its potential, Bitcoin’s current success is weakly founded and largely based on human psychology rather than intrinsic value.

I don't even know who 'madow' is. I also don't really 'enjoy memes', so I guess I missed the significance of the real Pepe and assumed it had been completely coopted. I've become so bored hearing about the US elections that I don't really pay attention any more. It's also completely possible that someone would put white supremacist memes in other memes. So basically, meh. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:15:49
I'm certainly not interested in day trading at the moment. So I guess the question is then, does it matter where I buy? And, are the web-services a safe option? If I can avoid buying a hardware wallet that would be good. 
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:20:16
Ah ha. They look very similar.

How much does he get paid per tweet again?
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:27:04
I don't live in 'Merica, but it's a wonder I mistook the two given that it's basically impossible to miss anything about the upcoming election and the two excellent candidates. 
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:22:47
What are you even talking about? Wind your neck in.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:00:25
Yeah, why is that? I'm guessing a homogenous market has something to do with it. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:15:41
Sure, PM it to me. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 08:53:32
n00b here, got a bit of coin with coinbase, would like some advice on where to put my coin if not in a exchange? 
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:47:55
I heard that it was coopted by white supremacists, which from what google has just told me appears to be partly true. Right or wrong, the anti-defamation league added it to it's list of hate symbols. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:04:20
Just out of interest. Is it possible to capitalise on the regularity of these price spikes? Does anyone here sell and rebuy and manage to get the timing right? Or is it too hard to call?
@_date: 2016-10-17 15:32:01
Wait for the Moscow propaganda machine to start bitching. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:28:10
Anyone know of any good exchanges in Germany which work with German banks? I have a German bank account too.
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:40:40
Uhhh, price increase through whale pump and dump is not good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:12:21
I hate this sub
