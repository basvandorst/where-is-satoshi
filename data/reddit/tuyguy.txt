I'm a Russian bot/spy/propaganda artist/supporter too. You're outnumbered on this thread.

He's probably a decent economist and a highly successful businessman. So not completely unqualified.

I've slowly grinded up to just over 1. Hoping to 2-5x that in BTC terms next bull run. Anything more than that would be a bonus.

There are people who have quit their job to trade crypto full time and I know a couple. They are profitable enough to get by.

Great point. If btc hadn't had gradual adoption it may have become worthless quickly.

Isn't the maker fee what the trader is paid for opening a limit position? Isn't this what a maker is paid? Why isn't this a good thing? 
My understand is limit=maker and market=taker.

Actually, some of the time it's in the womb the foetus' growth is exponential.

Without rechecking this list on mobile at least BCH is wrong. 
But thanks :)

Two observations:
 - Only 6 coins recorded a loss this year. Crypto is such a great investment because almost every coin will inevitably increase in value. 
 - One of the coins which lost value was USDT
When was this "year" started by the way? I'm going to guess around August 2017 because BCH did not enter the market Jan 2017 at $413. Nor did PAY enter at $47.8. But NEO was quite high around August. 
I'm very confused now...

Earlier today (~5k) mates were questioning whether btc would hit 6k before year's end. 
A few hours later it was 5.8k and we realised it might hit 6k before day's end :P

That's your example for screw the banks?
How about "Wall St Bankers caused one of the greatest economic collapses in history because of years of faulty loans and dodgey dealings. And then the US government bailed them out and the taxpayers footed the bill. No one went to jail. Screw the banks."

A linear graph of btc price would require a lot of scrolling
