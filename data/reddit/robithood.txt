Too much information unfortunately.. Ask me again on January 16th, 2014 ;)

$1100, but I'm just a speculator like everyone else on this rollercoaster.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:14:49
All three correct.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:37:20
High risk investment. It could be a giant paper weight before I get it delivered.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:38:18
I won't be paying for the power so I'm not sure. I've heard it purrs like a kitten.

23.8 BTC
Some BTC was involved in the transaction.
I will look into that.
There are others like it.
It eats bills yes.
Will look into bill sorting methods.
A, C, D.
First time I heard about Bitcoin was from my idol at $13 USD per coin. Did I listen. Nope. But I did when I saw $80 per coin. Now I research BTC and current ongoings approx. 4 hours a day as my day job entails being stuck somewhere, but not doing anything 90% of the time. Now I've bought flights, shirts, electronics, and good times with BTC.

Well I guess you won't be reading my posts until mid-January then? There's many other things that can be accomplished by many minds that I cannot do alone. Someone has already stated I will be driven out if I focus on lowest transaction fees. How do we fix that then?
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:25:27
If we publish our inner-workings, like the blockchain, and focus on exponential growth, I think it will work.

Blue &amp; Sliver ;)

I'm not looking for investors, I assure you that was covered instantaneously. Just thought it would be fun to see something different on here and involve reddit in my undertaking with this. It will be in Canada, and it will be announced by the end of January where it will be placed.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:02:16
So if everyone in this subreddit gave 0.08 BTC we got ourselves a commercial?!?
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:32:41
You're right. Canada :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:09:06
Well are your two heads doing something better for Bitcoin? I hope so cause this ATM is gonna be useless.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:17:19
You know I'm all over that now!
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:43:25
Well you have yet to meet an altruistic individual like myself then. I've spent thousands with no return on major Decentralization projects. Crazy or stupid, you decide.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:20:56
Precisely, or else I'd be parading this through the media for us already.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:27:17
In production :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:08:33
I'll say a promising location with well over 20 million visitors annually.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:16:41
On a floor, in a building that is open 11 hours a day minimum.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:47:04
There are systems in place within the ATM. We are working to ensure the simplest transaction capability for our clients when this whole thing comes to fruition.

Well if you want to get into hearsay I heard they are putting one in Toronto and another in Shanghai from one of their employees yesterday. Should be fine. I tried calling him, but no call back.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:21:28
As posted below, I'll say the bitcoin-friendly nation to the North of America.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:40:19
Not sure on American regulations.. We're north ;)

A flight the first day  started accepting BTC, the coolest thing I think you can buy with BTC is a trip into outter space with Virgin Galactic. A coooool 284.41 BTC. Meeting Satoshi Nakamoto would give me the opportunity to shake the hand of a genius that has given us the chance at personal financial freedom. Bringing banking to the micro level is something that has inspired me to risk it all for the betterment of mankind. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:56:24
We will have a link to our site that will have an out of this world FAQ 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:15:29
No problem, he accepts BTC for payment.
