But you didn't, and that's why you're here. "Could have" means jack shit in a world where "but did you?" is what matters.
You didn't make millions, you aren't rich, and you're very quickly on your way to having nothing because you are BAD at this.
Dump what's left in a mutual fund, and come clean to her. STOP FUCKING LYING TO YOUR SISTER.

She's obviously more capable of financial success than you, given at this point she hasn't managed to lose almost half a million dollars by gambling it. And yes, you were gambling, not investing. BTC's price swings are incredibly volatile and almost entirely unpredictable, which is why you're an idiot for 'investing' your entire inheritance and part of hers in it. You mock conventional investment portfolios because they earn single digit %s, but guess what? They're better at making money than you.
Not to mention there's plenty of mutual funds that earn over 10% yearly -on average-, which means that your 750k would be worth 1.5 million in about 7 years, if you hadn't squandered it.
Basically you're shit with money, irresponsible, and stupid, not to mention being a liar at this point. Dump what's left into a mutual fund as *her's*, come clean, and try to work out an agreement where she gives you a portion of the interest so you can rebuild your share.
You're looking at it like it's all yours, but its not. You don't have anything, and you're in fact in debt to her.

You're both a coward and a liar at this point. You've mislead her into mistakenly thinking you're not a fucking idiot, and then use the excuse that she believed your lies as proof that you're on the right track and nothing you've done is wrong. It's gonna be funny in a few years when you're depending on her charity.

People are helping you, you're just too goddamn dumb to listen. You got greedy, you got burnt, end of fucking story. Anything else at this point is pissing good money after bad, and basically a textbook example of a sunk cost fallacy.

My mutual fund (Davis, Class A) earns me about 11% a year on average, which means it doubles every 6.5 years, which automatically means it's an order of magnitude better than the money pit you've dug yourself into.
Hell, it earned 30% this year, which means you'd be a millionaire if you'd put your money into it, rather than on your way to the poor house.
Guess you're going to learn the value of money the hard way.

Did you at least take your sister out for dinner before you decided to fuck her?

There is literally nothing you can do. If the US government were to ban btc tomorrow or announce a tax on every transaction, its value would collapse overnight regardless of your investment sense (which you don't have anyway). YOU ARE NOT INVESTING, YOU ARE GAMBLING
Hell, you'd have probably had better odds in Vegas, I think the chance of winning roulette is almost 50%.
