What? I work my ass off in Singapore, 50+ hours a week and only got 30k SGD in savings for 16 years. What have I been doing with my life!?

If bitcoin is $15,000 then your fee is only $1.5 dollars. This fee is borne by you.
Credit card charges merchant a 2% fee (+ some stuff) which adds up to $300 dollars. Merchant normally absorb this fee but we all know its included in the price.
With bitcoin, the merchant earns more by saving on fees per transaction! And no chargebacks! But this probably won't work in a retail shop, only online purchases.

That 5.7k was really panicky haha. It went back down to 5.67k then kept going up and down for hours lol
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:31:36
That's assuming it keeps going down till 5600?
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:09:07
5.5k, good call. It only drop to 5.4k for a very small period, grats!

Miner currently receives a small fraction, I think is 0.00003? Something like that, for every transaction. So if you send 1 bitcoin from A to B, the miner that process that transaction will deduct his fee from that 1 bitcoin.
When all bitcoin is mined, and it still survives... then global adoption must be very wide. But i'm not sure if miners will still power on their machine 24/7, since they no longer need that much horsepower.

Depends what you are buying for. Most are recommending to buy and hold for long term.
But if you're looking at short term, things still looks good its a little below 5.9k atm, we're hoping to see another run to 6.2k then maybe 6.5k and hmm... not sure already.

Err.. this is kinda the reason why early adopters of bitcoin aren't all millionaire today. The ideal of bitcoin is to buy and spend it, not hold it. 
It's currently only an investment option because of the spike from 1k to 6k, which is now just confusing everybody.

I watched for 5 days.... didn't buy at 5.6k, didn't buy at 5.4k. Told myself, i would buy today at 5.3k. But I woke up to 5.7k, so i bought in at 5.7k. Never felt more stupid...

It's still better than sitting in the bank and earning "interest" that can't even cover inflation.

Good stuff, subscribed!

It actually started about 20 hours ago. I believe it's mainly investors who were waiting to enter at 4.9k but was "screwed" over at the 5.5k mark, so they are quickly buying in before it breaks the 6k mark.
Might have something to do with the amazon leak news though, whether fake or not.

1 bitcoin is 100,000,000 units. So you can always sell split 1 coin into well... however many shares you would like. 
What you are saying is just the reality of coins to dollars that we have in reality.
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:30:16
Wow 4 years, how much coins are you holding on to?

We will have to see if Seg2x fork is going to become a positive / negative thing. But ya, I agree that it's still a good time to buy and hold for awhile rather than leaving the money in the bank.
The only question is what's the ideal entry point to min/max a short term hold.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:29:54
With 2FA, its fine as long as the exchange doesn't crash. The main reason for really holding your coin on a private wallet is so that you get the forked coins, instead of having the exchange determine when/should you get it.
Update: Actually think of it this way. It's the same as leaving money in the bank. The bank close down, gg. If you withdraw and keep the cash in your wallet, then its always in your wallet. If you trust the bank, then np.

Which Satoshi? The one with the red hat?

I'm pretty sure that in a digital age, the value is simply deducted from a "card / chip" without even having to count.

I prefer line breaks to spaces.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:41:41
I dunno... it really depends on what price you bought in at
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:21:25
I could be wrong but this is what I understand atm, feel free to correct me.
Bitcoin grow based on adoption rate, how much its worth doesn't really matter since in a bitcoin economy, we would be using bitcoin/satoshi for buy/sell trades and not USD. A mars chocolate would be worth 0.0000012 bitcoin regardless whether bitcoin is 10k USD or 100k USD.
So anyone who adopts bitcoin, would simply buy and use it for purchases, thus giving bitcoin value. Like exchanging to a foreign currency before a holiday trip.
What makes the price move so much atm is because the spike weren't caused by a huge acceptance of bitcoin adopter or new technology emergence that encourage spending in the form of bitcoin. What happened was actually investors speculating on bitcoin to get free alt coins from forks, but how those fork magically has initial USD value is beyond me.
Now that the fork is over, and there's some negativity around it, investors simply decided to dump their hand to cash out their profit. It's a guaranteed profit since bitcoin went up linearly over the pass few weeks. They can always buyback bitcoin again at a lower price if they wanna speculate again.
Wait, so then why are ppl still buying bitcoin at its current price when its being "dumped"? (Overbought correction is actually the better term) People who didn't benefit from the previous spike, are hoping to get into bitcoin's next major spike before its too late. Basically, they just don't wanna get left out, so they are buying bitcoin as a form of value store (not currency). 
Did I get it right?
