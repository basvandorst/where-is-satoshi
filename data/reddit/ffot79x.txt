Wouldn’t making the tail come from the top of the S and circle around counter clockwise make it look more like an @ sign? Not trying to be a mean critic, just stating the obvious.

Hooyah my friend. Hooyah.

Unless if that .2btc that I could have bought with the difference ends up being tens of thousands. Lol
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:19:24
I retract my statement. Not entirely sure where I got 2040 from. Everything I'm reading now is saying 2140. Interesting. Sorry for the wrong info. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:42:19
Thank you for that. I think I get it now. I knew that the way I was thinking of it was too good to be true. Now let's throw this question for a spin. What if you are in a tax free zone when you decide to cash out? What are the implications of that?
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:49:55
HODL everything that seems promising. You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. The only question to ask yourself when investing is "do I see this around in 10 years?" If the answer is yes, then odds are it's a good investment. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:27:45
That's what I'm saying!! Sadly I bought a bitcoin yesterday at 4350. Just my luck. Lol
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:34:24
Haven't had any issues with coinbase... the guy who posted this is a nut job. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:48:07
Don't wait for the dip. You will regret that you did. Just jump on in son. The water is warm. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:02:45
Why is everyone trying to sabotage other crypto currencies? This is like left vs right mentality. Democrat vs republican. Can't we all just hope for the best for the entire cryptocurrency project?
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:55:00
Google "what is a bitcoin". 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:21:04
It's 2040... not that far way. 13 years. 
Edit* 23 years. Sorry for the brain fart. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:55:17
I know that in the military, when you are in tax free zones, any money you receive from reenlistment bonuses and monthly income will not be taxed. So when you are in a tax free zone, you usually see a lot of people with reenlistment bonuses reenlisting because those bonuses can get pretty big.

@_date: 2017-08-22 14:12:44
Survive what?? There's no reason for a war between cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:34:21
So if you never sell, and you spend it, you don't have to pay taxes on it?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:12:35
It said 2140 IF the computing power had remained the same since the beginning. No one knows for certain when exactly it will be, because computing power changes with every passing year. People speculate that with the increase that we have seen since 2009, 2040 seems like a safe bet. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:38:21
Gotcha. Thanks for that. That clears things up. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:13:12
Never asked anyone to go through all of them. Just why there’s an apparent war going on between BCH and BTC. They are pretty much identical currencies. So why the fud? It seems that you just might be mad bro. ��
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:16:04
Much more heavily invested in bitcoin in fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:38:33
So it’s settled.. no real information. Thank you. Back to square one. Let the war continue I guess. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:36:04
If you only knew how open minded I really am. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:11:09
It’s flipping back over to BTC very quickly at the moment. It went from 1 BCH = .045 to .030 in a matter of minutes. Glad I was on to be damage control when it happened and sold out of BCH for BTC at .35. Didn’t have too much of a warning. Just kind of did it. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:23:39
You misunderstand... I’m not “doing” anything. Just asking for real, unbiased, rational explanations. But it appears everyone here just wants war. So go ahead and be the human beings that you wish to be and continue to wage war for literally nothing. I’ll continue to believe in cryptocurrency as a whole and not try to tarnish the names of others. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:53:32
So are you capable of explaining to me exactly how BCH is a scam? Again, as I posed in my original post, everyone spreads tons of fud with no rational backing. Please do enlighten me. Not being facetious in the slightest either. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:43:23
True, True. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:30:19
XD. Flagged for removal for not wanting to be a part of the war. That’s great. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:00:38
Ahhh. Keep the name calling coming. ��just more so proves my point. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:40:56
Honestly... this is probably just the result of China and Korea waking up to a pretty penny and selling it off. You know how those Asians can be. ��
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:24:57
I completely agree. Which is why I see no reason for BCH and BTC supporters to be trying to bite each others’ heads off. I’m personally a supporter of both. I’ve spent both as well as invested in both and I hope the best for both of them. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:21:10
So why are people always spreading fud back and forth? We are all kind of in this together. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:35:46
Again... still fud. Please. Pleeeeaaaaase, give me real info. You seem to be incapable. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:14:35
Also invested in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:50:24
If you’re talking about price and relevance, why is bitcoins price so high then? If we price things appropriately, neither BTC nor BCH should be as high as they are. That not what my question was though. I’m asking for differences between the 2. Rational reasoning behind why all the fud has to be spread back and forth, which is what you just started doing again. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:51:22
Cheers mate. Things will come around. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:48:58
How do I do this???
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:18:02
So who would this middle man be? And how are the two of us to know that we can trust this middle man?
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:51:24
You're asking the wrong questions... there isn't anywhere that you could put your money and make "guaranteed" big returns on it. The way I see it, if you can't afford to put that $450 into a risky investment such as bitcoin, you probably shouldn't even be glancing at possible profit margins from it. If you know anything about investing, it's not the amount that you're making, it's the percentage return that is important. If you put $450 into bitcoin and you made $300 in just one year of it being put away, then you would be doing better than 99% of wall street. Those aren't bad figures.
So the question should be "Can I afford to put more into bitcoin than just $450?" If the answer is no, then you will need to settle for your "small" take of $300(which isn't guaranteed either). 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:17:32
I don't believe China waking up is going to cause it to go down. If anything, they are going to be buying when they wake up to the $600 price dip. Why would they do any different than we would?
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:15:20
I could sell you btc if you are serious about buying. I'm not going to be the one to send first however. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:38:04
Interesting that you think because others had a different point of view that they are a fraud, backstabbing, greed parasites. �� I'm sorry you feel that way. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:48:58
How do I do this???
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:44:55
Very well could be. But I'm still in it for the long haul so it is of little importance to me. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:48:34
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:36:54
I'm about 50% BCH with the hopes of it catching up to BTC someday, 40% BTC with the hopes of it going to the moon and 10% alt coins such as XMR, LTC, ETH and XRP.
