I was abroad and I had to pay the electricity bill of the apartment I stayed for a couple of months on my last day because the amount depended on the counter at the time of my departure. My plane was leaving in the morning and the person couldn't be there at the time I was leaving.
Previously I had paid her by paypal but for whatever reason I couldn't log in because it asked for a confirmation by phone number and I didn't have a phone number in this place cause I stayed temporarily.
I emailed the girl asking if I could send her bitcoin and she said OK. Apparently she already had an account on an exchange so she just generated a public address. So when I left I took a picture of the electric counter, a screenshot of the price at that time, and a little calculation for the amount of bitcoin. I emailed everything with a link to the transaction on a blockchain explorer.
Done ! With other methods there are always delays and complications. Bitcoin just works.

I think in most places capital gain tax would apply only when you convert your bitcoin to the local fiat. Or when you buy something with it (if reported).
But if you earn a wage and your employer accepts to pay you in bitcoin, he most likely would have been through the KYC process on his own exchange. So it's a good idea to mix your Coin so no one can ever track you to them.

Bitcoin is the great filter of civilization that could explain the Fermi Paradox.
Crypto technology will allow us to bring down systems of controls and preserve our individual freedoms. I see this as a necessary step in the evolution of our civilization, that will allow us to continue to invent and innovate until we reach the stars.
The alternative is the totalitarian dystopia that we can already see building up: where every thought you have is surveilled and censored, and where every idea that steps out of line is destroyed before even being expressed. If we allow our civilization to fall into this trap we will never get out of this planet.

Sorry but your solutions sound like crap. There are countless scamming exanges and financial services pretending to offer professionnal service but require ID verification, address, phone number, date of birth, and usually they don't tell until the end about the ridiculous fees they charge. You think you're having a deal when they'll sell all your data to third parties and governments.

Yeah. They'll just refuse any transaction that do not come from a 'verified' account. I'm 100% sure they'll claim this is to prevent fraud and money launderers. It's just business as usual for them.
But of course the blockchain will confirm the transaction. That's not the problem. The problem is the exchange will keep the bitcoin in it's pocket and refuse to service you while you don't play their game.

I don't agree at all. Normies Starbuck customers don't give a damn about bitcoin nor the financial freedom that it brings. On the contrary most people despise it. They'll look at the cost and inconvenience of bitcoin over credit card and any fiat payment method and they'll laugh at us.
Those people will only make the switch when they have to, it's there's a crisis. Meanwhile don't count on them for adoption.
Adoption will come from small business owners who accept bitcoin directly. When enough daily bitcoin user small businesses get bigger and richer and it starts hurting big player's wallet, then they'll have no choice to accept bitcoin directly too to accomodate a growing pool of customers who want to spend bitcoin.

I know right? One of the greatest thing about Bitcoin IMO is that we are responsible of our own money without the need of a third party. As I can easily create a wallet on my smartphone I'd expect any retailer to be able to do the same thing. But as you can see they are still stuck in the old paradigm, and still rely on third party to overcomplicate things.
Maybe smaller businesses will have a competitive advanage in the near future, because they'll be easier to commerce with in cryptos?

If the BTC you bought with your KYC info is sent to another address, I doubt tax authorities will let you merely declare in good faith that they belong to someone else without that someone else agreeing to declare it is now the new owner.
If bitcoin becomes much more valuable, States are going to do anything they can to take it from individuals and if they can use KYC info that one individual at one point owned some bitcoin, they'll assume he still owns it until he can prove he doesn't. They'll put the burden of proof on the individual, as a way to hack your bitcoin through the legal system. Even if you mix them, even with CoinJoin, it doesn't matter. The legal ownership of an UTXO will be linked to your ID until you can prove it isn't, and from there they'll be able to tax your bitcoin property just like any real estate property.

They had three questions:
1) Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have left in the account if you left the money to grow? **A. More than $102** B. Exactly $102 C. Less than $102 D. Don't know
2) Imagine the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, how much would you be able to buy with this money in this account? A. More than today B. Exactly the same **C. Less than today** D. Don't know
3) Please tell me whether or not this statement is true or false: Buying a single company’s stock usually provides a safer return than a mutual fund of stocks. A. True **B. False** C. Don't know
Starting at 0, a good answer gave +1, a wrong answer gave -1, and 'Don't know' gave 0. Total of 3 points is high financial literacy, 1 or 2 points is medium financial literacy. 0 or less is low financial literacy.
They found out that, among people aware of Bitcoin, people wrong on question 3) were 6.7 times more likely to own Bitcoin than people who answered correctly, after correcting for age group, sex, province, marital status, employment status, and income.

I've just read the whole thing. Researchers did an excellent job in understanding Bitcoin to survey this understanding in the population. Remember that voluntary surveys like this are non-probabilistic. Here is imo an underrated quote:


I think this is consistent with what Andreas was saying: people who have easy access to banking do not need Bitcoin, as they are already privileged. Others, like immigrants who send money to their families abroad, are much more likely to hold Bitcoin because they have a direct need for it.

What I know is it does happen that a judge orders someone to give his bitcoin to the court custody else he'll go to jail. If the bitcoin moves while he's in jail he has to appeal the judge's decision, but that's often impossible from jail. Many legal systems are crappy like that.

You are morally right. But if you are facing a State who doesn't care what is moral or not, and it owns the firepower and it wants to take your stuff, it doesn't matter if you are right. They'll take your shit by force.


Decentralized exchanges already exist. But they are empty because even within the cryptocurrency community, the overwhelming majority of people prefer to accept any potential risk in the future for convenience they can feel today. I think it will blow up to their faces because if bitcoin becomes much more valuable, and I think it will, States are going to come after it and they'll not hesitate one second to use the KYC info they got to put bitcoin hodlers in jail and to seize their stuff.

Keep track of each piece of communication with them. Make Print Screens if necessary. When you log into your account, does it say the transaction is Processed or Processing (or equivalent vocabulary) ?
Also keep records of the way you think the frausder had access to your account. If you can proove you informed them to cancel the transaction on time, you'll have more chance to not lose your bitcoin or maybe even have them reimbursed to you.

@_date: 2018-06-07 05:47:56
There is no problem with the bitcoin protocol. The transaction would have succeeded if it was done only between me and the merchant. It failed because the bitcoin were sent to a third party, who blocked it for whatever reason (I guess because I don't use and pay fees to their own centralized exchange as my 'wallet').


Same if the payment was made in fiat cash. Merchants do not have an obligation to accept refunds once a deal is complete, whatever currency was used.
About merchants not wanting foreign currency, if I can manage to handle both bitcoin and my country's fiat for my personnal finances, I don't see why any merchants big or small wouldn't be able to do the same.

If any merchant claim they accept bitcoin, I expect them to accept bitcoin. Not to divert my transaction to a third party to make me do the conversion before accepting the payment.
Bitcoin is a currency, not a centralized company like Visa or Mastercard. A merchant saying 'We accept Bitcoin' is like saying 'We accept US dollar', not 'We accept Visa'. If a company accepts multiple currencies, either the products price should be shown in those multiple currencies, or the conversion rate between the currencies is agreed upon at the time of purchase.
Don't you think it would be easy if the merchant just advertise its prices in JPY, you go to the cashier and ask to pay with BTC, you look at an exchange conversion rate and agree on a price in BTC, then make the bitcoin transaction directly between the client and the merchant? I think it's very easy and could even be done automatically. 
It just requires the merchant to accept BTC as a currency. Not as a payment method to convert to fiat, by requiring the customer to register and pay fees to an exchange. Done the old way, there is no advantage to use crypto over a credit card.


Hence the need to have specialized businesses to assist retailers handle their crypto safely.


IDK. Guess the market will decide that. I think that's where bitcoin dominance matters because if most customers agree on the convention that bitcoin is the main crypto currency, the choice will be much easier for merchants.

I had a very similar experience when my bitcoin payment at Bic Camera in Japan wasn't received. I made a Post about it [here](
I refused to pay a second time for the item until I got my refund. I got my refund after three weeks, but not before I created an account on their exchange (BitFlyer). And guess what: I had to give them personnal information (name, date of birth) and pay their 0.0004 fee to send the BTC back to my own wallet.
There is a urgent need for a business to help these companies set up wallets to make payment AND refunds quick and safe.

I finally got my refund. I kept writing to BitFlyer Customer support and the kept telling me to be patient. Finally the BTC were deposed in my BitFlyer account and I could transfer them to my own wallet after another two working days, 'for safety' and 'to prevent money laundering' apparently.
I am still very unsatisfied with the experience. I would have to go back to the store to buy the product again if I want it. And I still have no garantee it will work this time.
Also, I never wanted to have to deal with BitFlyer. I was forced to if I wanted to receive my money back. That means I had to give them personnal information (name, date of birth) and I had to pay the fees to withdraw my BTC from the account (0.0004 at the time).
And I had to wait for three weeks. If the price had skyrocketed during this delay, do you seriously think they would have refunded me the whole 0.031 BTC, or they would instead refund me the price in fiat at the time of purchase?
What I learned of my experience: Despite my wish, Bitcoin adoption by large companies is not as advanced as it seems to be. Even when they pretend they accept bitcoin, they deal with third parties that take advantage of their position. There is a urgent need for businesses and / or applications to help smaller and bigger companies process payments and refunds quickly and safely.

I moved from Coinsquare because they raised their CAD withdrawal fees without notice. I read QuadrigaCX's withdrawal page and I searched google, youtube and reddit for reviews about that particular exchange. I understood that delays were long but in the end people got their money. In July 2018 I did a first withdrawal and it took 2 months. I wrote a ticket to QuadrigaCX asking why the delays were so long. Helpdesk answered it was because canadians banks were doing everything they could to harm crypto adoption.  I thought it was a canadian bank issue.

So I had to create an account at bitFlyer to claim it back. It took weeks and I had to pay their withdrawal fee.
I think some exchange might just grab the money and never send it back.

Because sometimes I need to sell crypto for fiat? I keep my private keys. Sold for 2.5K CAD in october. Did not keep it there longer than a day. Yet my withdrawal was pending for two months and I still didn't get my money.
There is nothing to learn from this except that there is no safe way to transfer fiat money.
@_date: 2019-02-04 13:22:50
That's not a reason to delay withdrawals from the exchange to bank accounts. Doing so only hurt customers, not the exchanges. Coinsquare takes 2% of every withdrawal.
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:14:29
What are you talking about? My bitcoin are safe because I keep my private keys. The moment I sent some to QuadrigaCX to sell it for fiat it was lost.
Lesson learned: Fiat is broken.

It takes 3 months to withdraw fiat in Canada. Nobody is going to withdraw only 500$ every 3 months. Delays were the same when I withdrew fiat from Coinsquare last summer. The banks delay everything related to crypto.

I emigrated from my country to start all over elsewhere. I had a good job before, but instead of retirement, I chose to reimburse the mortgage as soon as possible.
In december 2017, I sold the house and put everything into bitcoin. I wisely chose not to buy right away. I dca over the first half of 2018 instead.
People can call me stupid. There must be other options out there that I am not aware of. But bitcoin is the only way I could carry my money with me to many countries and have access to it whenever I wanted, without any permission to ask to anybody. My credit card payments are constantly denied because of 'suspicious activity'. Bitcoin saved my life many times, as I could find people willing to trade it for cash when I needed it.

Look coinsquare.io . It's the one I used to buy BTC with CAD. I also used it to sell my BCH for CAD.
Fees for bank drafts were 0.25%. There was some fee for the withdrawal of CAD. I guess there is hidden fee for trades because the price was a little different than other exchanges.
Read their websites. There should be answers for your questions. I don't think trading in USD should cause any problem.
Good luck !

That is 1128 days before december 31st 2018. The price should grow at a steady rate of 0.410146% per day to reach the objective.

Well if it's not renewable it only means eventually the power source will run out. That may be in a very long time.
The advantage of renewable power is that power companies have a lot of spare electricity, because the power supply is impredictable while the demand is predictable. So if it rains, sunshine or winds a lot, the surplus energy is wasted because the high demand might not be at the same time. Crypto miners could capitalize on that fact while negociating with power companies.

No they're not. France is an africanized country. You can bring them the cure to ebola, they'll lynch you believing it's a white men desease. You can bring bitcoin to the french, they'll lynch you because they're suspicious of the technology.
You may understand that bitcoin can solve their problem. But they don't understand this at all. They'll confuse you with their enemy and they'll not hesitate to rip your head off too. Stay away from them. Let them fail and realize their mistakes.
Most yellow vests are the blue collars left behind by globalization and automation. They are very suspicious of any technology. You guys just jump on the opportunity because you saw a guy with a "buy btc" vest. It just looks desperate for adoption. But the yellow vests don't understand any of this. They're emotional. They started againsts the gas tax, but now they are advocating for more welfare! They think their government don't take good care of them enough, not that the government itself is the problem. They don't know what they want. They just want to throw a tandrum like spoiled children.

Nah I'll keep paying them with their own worthless fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:39:22
Bitcoin is an answer to banks, governments, and establishments failures.
I bet near the end of april when people pay their taxes, bitcoin will surge. Bitcoin will moon at the next recession. Because it is a safe asset. Fiat money will be the one fluctuating.
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:22:39
localbitcoin.com , or craigslist
even better if you can buy goods and services directly with btc
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:47:55
Unfortunately yes. They have lots of money to throw around and to manipulate the market with, once they understood they can't hack nor outlaw bitcoin. The cryptos will still fluctuate a lot.
I think what will the most push the demand for cryptos and accelerate adoption is when the next recession hit. Some banks will fail, governments will bail them out and tax the hell out of their citizens, and lots of people will lose their fiat savings.
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:39:02
It's a better Means of Exchange than fiat and it's a better Store of value than fiat.

It seems arbitrary.
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:56:48
Not sure I can understand without her picture.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:13:22
I used the same formula. But with slightly different rates because I took the midpoint between open and close rates for the days, from Coinbase BTCUSD. I have:
1) July 17th, 2017: 2268.85
2) November 29th, 2017: 9882.75$
3) December 31st, 2020
Range between 1) and 3) is 1263 days. Range between 1) and 2) is 135 days.
Growth rate to reach 1M$ from 1) to 3) is Exp[(Log[1000000] - Log[2268.85])/1263] - 1 == 0.0048322890082384
Then I have 2268.85*(1 + 0.0048322890082384)^135 == 4349.50$ &lt; 9882.75$ on November 29th, 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:33:11
Depends on the situation. Maybe it's better to never come out of the bitcoin closet.
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:31:55
All this because Bitcoin's mum was pumped and dumped by the holy spirit last december.

I used coinsquare.io to buy BTC with CAD. Their fees for bank drafts were 0.25%.
Go read their policy regarding CAD withdrawal. I think you must be verified.
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:45:48
Amen !
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:27:28
It's just the monthly increase % that dropped. The number of wallet users still raised 4.25% according to this chart.

We're in the same boat. Started buying in 2016 but I made my bigger purchases last january, so overall I bought for an average cost of 12.5K. Not selling anytime soon.
I worked my ass off in higher education and in my last corporate job, only to have a large part of my wealth taken away by all kinds of taxes and regulators. So no thanks. Bitcoin might be volatile, but I know no one will take them from me.

I know it sounds strange, but yes, I believe Bitcoin is what Africa needs to liberate commerce and connect that continent to the world economy. They need it more than we need it. Hence Bitcoin adoption starts with them.

The Bitcoin Embassy in my area once openly targeted craigslist/backpage self-employed to receive payments in bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-03-12 16:23:59
I see. Then I come up with 7146.25$ for today.
McAfee himself must have made his 1M prediction based on his original date of July 17th, because predicted price on nov.29 should be 4349,50$ while it was already 9882.5$.
Hence the confidence to eat his dick.
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:08:43
I think bitcoin will keep it's dominance. First mover-advantage counts for a lot in currencies, because Bitcoins would be replaced by what? There are so many others. Even if the % still drops to 25%., the altcoins are so scattered that the difference between bitcoin and the second altcoin will not be threatening.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:24:25
It was costly in time obviously. On the other hand I also learned a lot about what works and what doesn't. I met people and shared my interest in bitcoin. That is also valuable.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:21:16
My nephew is your eldest's age. Gave him a little btc for his 10th birthday. Best gift I've ever given, not even for the money value, but for all the learning opportunity.
P.S.: You should go check the price right now.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:50:03
Right ! Haven't thought of layer 2 networks.
With adoption and the raise in value, I can foresee people will start talking about millibitcoin (mBTC). My wallet already does by default.
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:37:28
Great. Anyone working on speeding up cryptos transaction times now have to pay royalties to PayPal now.

@_date: 2018-03-25 04:20:23
Me. I started investing in fall 2016 / winter 2017, but I made my biggest BTC purchase in January 2018.
I bought some in november 2017 with cash at a Bitcoin atm, but I noticed the transaction fees were way too high and that the price was going up way too fast. So I waited to get registered in an exchange and I bought in january for much lesser fees, and at a much lower price. Overall in average I bought my BTC for approx 12K USD. Don't regret it. I hodl it ever since. I'm leaving my country soon anyways so I prefer to hodl part of my wealth in btc than anything else.
I introduced BTC to some of my friends this year. I just created an online wallet for a small amount and told them they had a gift. They really enjoyed learning how that worked and I bet they will be more curious about it from now.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:45:52
Really? Do you ask the current exchange price or a % more? Do Localbitcoin takes a cut?
If it's really worth it I might take a disposable SIM card at the airport and register there in my next country.

@_date: 2018-04-01 16:51:06
Not trying to blame anyone but... that's why price is falling these days. More people are trying to sell their bitcoin due to life expenses. Less people are trying to buy bitcoin after last year hype.

So if BTC passes 1M then falls below 1M at the end of 2020, will Schrödinger eat his dick or not ?

No. When ebay will claim they make bitcoin payment, they won't make bitcoin payment. They will divert your transaction to their exchange account where it will be converted to whatever fiat at an even worse rate than credit card companies. All this with your KYC/AML info to track you down, of course, and the power to reject your transaction for whatever reason, as it already happenned to me at Bic Camera in Japan.
They are slow to implement bitcoin payment because they are financial engineering ways to use the bitcoin brand to rip you off even more.

Given the direction things are going, bitcoin will never reach it's ATH ever again. Not saying it can't, but it would take a drastic change in people's attitude toward financial responsibility.
All the advantages bitcoin has over other payment methods are promptly being neutralized. It's nearly impossible to acquire bitcoin without the whole KYC/AML process and/or without getting ripped off. I downloaded Bisq and it's fucking empty.
When people realize bitcoin has nothing to offer, even if it's false it doesn't matter, the price will stagnate to low levels for a very long time. Maybe forever.

Had a similar experience when I went to my bank to deposit about 500$ of pennies and quarters that I accumulated for years. They refused to do it. Told me to go to a machine made for that purpose  in some corner store. I go to the machine: I'd have to spend an hour to put every penny in it, and it takes 30%.
