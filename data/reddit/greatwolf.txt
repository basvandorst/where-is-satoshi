HA, you wish. They're going to look at what's available from the liquidity asset pot and they're going to do everything they can to pull the most profit out through the legal process. You think you're the only one that's greedy?
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:56:44
As much as I'm hoping a better scenario would turn up, I think this is the best way forward if they can't fulfill their obligations. Please don't let it drag on for years and years like mtgox. I still haven't received my 2 btc from kraken btw who took over handling mtgox's liabilities to creditors -- and that has been how long? 3 fucking years!
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:14:42
yea it's a strange world we live in. Bankruptcy proceedings would not only mean time, capital and other resources expended for no good reason but think of the mental strain on the creditors as this gets dragged out for years.
At least with this restitution proposal we have a resolution. Get back what we can and move on with our lives.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:22:48
From the info gathered so far, finex has 2 private keys, one in cold store and another that's hot. The third private key from bitgo. The thieving transactions were signed by bitfinex's hot key + bitgo's private key.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:18:25
What's the probability this outcome ends up similar to gox in terms of restitution? That's been dragging on for years and there still isn't any final resolution of that btw. Lost 2 btc on that.
Or will this be closer to poloniex's hack, where they slowly make their affected customers whole again over time?
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:10:12
Finex controls 2 keys; one is hot, one is cold, bitgo controls 1 for cosigning in this multisig configuration. The customer does not control any of the private keys in this setup.
This means the majority of the control is still under Finex.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:14:56
Sound a bit like the `OP_OUTPUTVERIFY` proposal.
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:31:56

Just wondering, how many people are in the office now that's investigating and containing this situation?
How's Phil taking all this?
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:43:58
Any ETA on when the site is coming back up? Probability of coming up end of today? Or probability of coming up by tomorrow? Even a ballpark figure helps.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:10:50
Now that's something we can work with. I completely agree with the OP here. This just doesn't add up.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:36:08
Well hopefully after this ordeal we've all learn to not keep such large amounts on there that we lose sleep over it if it finex gets hacked again.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:39:11
How can I check if finex+bitgo multisig wallet that belongs to me got drained or not? Do I simply check the 3xxx... address I deposited into?
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:55:27
That of course raises the question, why was CFTC ok with finex+bitgo multisig hot wallet setup at all.
Somehow CFTC feels the more secure hot/cold setup is less regulatory compliant than the current 100% multisig hot wallet -- they allowed finex to go through with it afterall.
That to me right there says CFTC has no business butting in considering they have neither the competence nor expertise to make such evaluations and judgement calls. All they did was cause a business to use a less secure form of fund storage.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:25:23
yeah, check out  titled bitcoin covenants. There's a section about bitcoin transaction vaults.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:13:08
We do actually, at least partially. We at least know the thieving transactions were cosigned w/ Bitgo's private key and the total sum of all the finex transactions they've signed off on is 119,756 btc.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:21:45
Is that 36.067% the percent loss from the total balance or do we interpret that as how much is left after the loss?
    `newbalance == prehack_balance * 0.36067`
    `newbalance == prehack_balance * (1 - 0.36067)`
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:16:48
I can tell you right now, as someone who lost 2 btc there, 0 so far. zero, nada, zilch. not a single satoshi
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:20:19
And do you realise bitfinex doesn't actually have a central office? Most of their employees are all over the world. Even if say you liquidate their assets, what would they even have to liquid that would come close to covering 70 million dollar loss in bitcoins?
Given what we're seeing in mtgox bk proceedings so far, anyway you want to slice this, going the litigation route you are worse off than settling in-house off-court with the restitution proposal.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:55:21
They already payed 1.5k btc for the first hacking lesson. Now they're paying 119k btc for a second lesson because they didn't learn the first time. If they get hacked again they deserve to be in jail.
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:19:36
Well it looks like they don't even have a formal office. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:52:29
can you please put out the fire over here? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:38:43
There's two ways you can argue this.
1. We all deposited funds into the exchange whether that be btc, usd, ltc whatever. We all share the same risk that bitfinex could go belly up tomorrow or they pull an exit scam. So why should some be punish with heavier losses than others when the risk is equal for all?
2. Forgetting all matters of fairness and just consider this from a game theory perspective, what would a rational actor(actors meaning customers and not the exchange operators) do in this situation?
 They could sue likely going into court bankruptcy proceedings. What is the cost of that in terms of time, resources and funds? The closest thing we have to compare that to is mt gox. How is that going? not very well. This is 3 years later and there still isn't any final resolution. It's unclear if even any of the creditors have even been compensated yet. There are no winners in this scenario except parasitic lawyers slowly draining fees away in a protracted legal process until at the end you get back much less than you otherwise would.
 Or the actor could go with the proposed bitfinex restitution plan. Yeah they're account balance takes a major hit, it sucks but at least you get a good amount back in a much more timely manner than the legal scenario above. We all learn our lesson(hopefully) and move on with our lives.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:04:08
They still control 2 of those keys.

I don't know if I agree with Balaji that bitcoin is easily modifiable. Sure you can technically modify the source to do what you want but achieving consensus on change is proving extremely difficult. Just look at the max block size debate as an example.
As time goes on Bitcoin will continue to ossify making changes to the protocol ever more difficult. Look at IPv6 -- every supporting reason to switch to it is there but yet the overwhelming major is still on v4.

A Multi-sig wallet means coinbase does not have full custodial control over customer's coins. That means the only way that 3-letter agency can get control is if the customer *willingly cooperates* and *voluntarily* hands it over.
That runs completely contrary to confiscation which implies lack of choice through force.

If you're using blockchain.info, under "send money" -&gt; custom, you can specify exactly how much in fees you want to pay for a given transaction. You can put 0.0 if you want but for dust-like transactions like &lt; 0.001, no miners will likely include it in their block and so it'll probably never get confirmed -- just a caveat.
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:53:58

Bitcoin transactions, by its nature, is a push action. So when they submit a payment request to you, just check and make sure you're being billed for the right amount. If anything's fishy or you're being charged more than expected just reject that transaction.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:02:22
Did you copy the base58 encoded result from 'converter' and pasted it into the 'Private Key' field in the 'generator' tab?
If so you may have borked it. As per Pieter Wuielle's answer here: 
The uncompressed form of the private key always starts with a '5'. Compressed keys start with either 'K' or 'L'. Yours starting with a '3' seems like your private key is encoded incorrectly.

I don't think you'll get much out of compression methods. The bulk of the transaction are made of cryptographic signatures and hashes which means there's no recognizable pattern to compress.
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:48:03
-1, this is completely misleading. ECDSA ***is not*** compromised -- that hack only works if the attacker can somehow make you use a a piece of software with a compromised ECDSA  implementation that generates and uses weak predictable ephemeral keys *k* when doing the signature.
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:51:04
Good ideas, but I'm wondering how can the consensus code be encapsulated in a language agnostic matter?
I'd imagine the standalone consensus code has to be able to be integrated in any bitcoin node implementation regardless of the language used for that implementation.
Maybe using the lowest common denominator language something like C since everything can integrate with that. Another idea is to try to extract out the consensus code into an embeddable scripting language like Lua. Then use the hash from that lua script?

Are they going to implement this in the form of a new altcoin, like greececoin, that's backed by their assets or are they going to use something like color coins making use of Bitcoin's existing blockchain and infrastructure?
If the former, who is allowed to participate in that network and how will decentralization be achieved? Is that even a requirement? How will they secure it? Or will it be more of a centralized database that's just a bit more transparent?
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:27:20
Just to clarify, the theoretical max is closer to 7tps assuming all transactions are simple transactions -- that is no multisig, no complicated scripts, just simple single input to output.
But that is not realistic, and in practice we do infact get closer to 3-4 tps precisely because we're doing all those fancy scripting features which requires more bytes on the blockchain.

Once you scan the paper wallet onto a smart device that's online that paper wallet can no longer be considered 'cold'. Note that your public key is also exposed now since you broadcasted the transaction that swept the funds.
The lack of a change address isn't the reason for sweeping the full amount, afterall you can just use the same paper wallet address as the change address. You sweep the full amount precisely because you don't intent to reuse that address again.

They could have done this before bitcoin ever came into existence.

I don't believe it is. In ECC math 0 and infinity are considered the same -- they're both neutral elements in the finite field and so that's excluded from the private key selection. That's why the selection range starts at 1.

60 bits == 6000 satoshis or 0.00006000btc.
0.00006 * $275 usd/btc == 0.0165 dollars -- that's less than 2 cents. Such small amounts on the Bitcoin network is considered dust and spending them would be relatively expensive; you would have to pay at least that amount in miner fees just to redeem that input or you'll have to wait a long time for it to get into a block.

I haven't tried it myself but I would imagine so. I'd imagine the redemption scripts used would be something to the effect of
    OP_0 2 &lt;pubkey1&gt; &lt;pubkey2&gt; &lt;pubkey3&gt; 3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
Since you know all 3 pubkeys used just substitute them in, sha256 hash it and make sure that hash matches the p2sh of the multisig address you're sending to.

A properly implemented multsig mechanism will give you access to the redemption script or someway to reconstruct that script yourself.
For example, Bitgo's backup pdf gives you a QR code for user key, backup key, bitgo's public key. Similarly, coinbase's multsig vault gives you coinbases's public key, shared public key and user public key. You have access to the private keys of the last two.

This is implementation detail and it's hidden from the user. The wallet software you're using automatically handles this for you.
The question is either that specific implementation is secure or not. Usually the only way to know that is to either inspect the source and/or see if there's been any complains from other users on whether their funds have been stole or not.

It sounds like I'm being hard on him but I'm expressing my objections based on my pass experience with him. Consider the current state of security of the forum, if a hacker gets access to your BCT account password its game over. At that point they are free to pretty change anything they want in your account, your btc address, email, secret recovery question -- all without ever needing a confirmation to your original email you registered with!
It's a questionable and dubious effort to start writing brand new code-base forum software from scratch for the reasons already given by others but lets assume that's not a major quorum. Shouldn't Theymos *at least* make the forum more secure as an interim solution until that project comes to fruition? At the very least enabling email confirmation would help with that.
That's one of the very reasons why scams and account frauds is so prevalent in BCT.
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:55:00
Everytime you sign a transaction and redeem an output, there are actually two keypairs involved: your public and private key(P, p) that you already know and also a session keypair or sometimes called ephemeral keypair(let's call it (R, r) ).
The ephemeral keys are chosen randomly and it's used only for the current transaction you're signing. Everytime you sign a transaction a new ephemeral private key is generated.
Reusing your exist public private key normally isn't an issue if you're not concerned about privacy. The security risk comes from either reusing a a session keypair (R, r) with another transaction or the wallet software you're using has a compromised or weak PRNG that generates predictable (R, r). If that happens then you've effectively leaked your private key and a malicious actor can steal the funds from that bitcoin address.

100% agree with this, especially with how he failed to restore my hacked BCT account. Despite me having sent him multiple signed messages from several bitcoin addresses associated with my old account and PM'ing him multiple times over the course of several months -- not a single reply back.
This coupled with the new vaporware forum project. And add to the fact that he still hasn't enabled email confirmation to the original email address on changes to critical forum account details and no 2fa implementation on BCT -- there are available 2fa mods out there for SMF-based forums.
I cannot in good conscience recommend Theymos to be a mod on as well given how he's managed the other one.

Technically, miners don't have to verify transactions to create bitcions. eg. Think empty blocks containing only the coinbase transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-12 20:03:05
There's no need to regulate those miners at home because they don't contribute anything really to the overall global hashrate. That's what happens when you have centralized mining.
Now if buying ASIC's was as easy as just buying your commodity hardware at bestbuy or fry's, that would help decentralize mining a bit. Or change SHA256 to something that's more ASIC unfriendly.
As it stands now if slapping regulation does indeed shutdown those 3 big mining entities that's enough to DOS the Bitcoin network similar to what happens with altcoins with huge spiking hashrates that don't implement some quicker retarget mechanism.
@_date: 2015-09-12 20:08:32
Eventually the difficulty will match the real hashrate but until that happens such a huge drop in hashrate will DOS the Bitcoin network -- no transaction will go through until the retarget happens. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 10:05:33
I prefer the former mainly because it's more decentralized and less reliant their servers being up. The wallet still functions even if airbitz's authentication servers go down. Private key backups are automatic, encrypted on the cloud so restoring your wallet on a different device is easy.

First of all, blocks are not chained together using MD5, its SHA256. Second, the growth is not exponential, it's linear -- there is an upper bound to how big blocks can be and how frequent new blocks are found(currently 1MB/10 minutes).
Even if blocksize gets increased under Gavin's new proposal there is still an upper bound. It does not change the asymptotic complexity of storage requirements.
Worse case, you can always prune the old blocks since you don't need the entire history all the time.

A question in the hardcore section: What is a Merkle Root/Tree? None of the answers there really capture what a Merkle Tree is.
First and foremost it is a data structure that gives you a way to summarize all the transactions going into a block and gives you a way to construct a short proof that a transaction was included in a given block.
While the output of a merkle tree does get included in making up part of the block header, it is *not used* directly to compute the block hash. Therefore the multiple-guess choice "An algorithm used to calculate the block hash" is wrong.

When you construct a Cryptonote transaction, you can put in there any previous output even if they don't belong to you -- how many depends on the mixin count and how anonymous you want it to be. This forms the group for the ring signature scheme. Let's call this mixin count `n`.
Now one of these outputs *will* actually belong to you. The new output of this transaction is a new one-time address that's never been used before. Then you sign the whole thing and broadcast.
Now anyone can verify the signature and they know one of these inputs actually belongs to you but they won't know *exactly which one* it is. The best they can do is guess and the probability of them guessing correctly is `1/n`. The higher your mixin count `n` you use the less lightly they can tell where the funds came from. This is what gives cryptonote coins such as monero its untraceability property.
The second important point is that *all* addresses you see on this blockchain are one-time-use addresses -- meaning this is the first time *and* the last time this address is used and never used again. So even if you do choose the right address that address has no prior history. This gives Monero its unlinkability property.
Both of these properties together is how Monero is able to provide such strong anonymity guarantees -- much stronger than say Darkcoin or traditional coinmixing because you're not relying on a third party at all.That's it for the ELI5 explanation. If you want to know the actual nitty gritty technical details on how they achieve both of these you'll have to read the cryptonote whitepaper.

Another way to look at it is in raw hexadecimal form, one byte is composed of 2 alphanumeric(0-9, A-F), that gives you the upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits(sometimes called a nibble).
In ASCII hex form, you end up with 64 characters (32*2). Converting back to bits you get `64 / 2 * 8` giving you exactly 256 bits.

While his blog sounds a bit anti-bitcoin I can't fault him on his analysis. At least he backs up his viewpoints with some solid technical arguments unlike some of the other articles out there.
While many of the issues he brings up are already well known and discussed, the take away I got from the article is this: what happens when the incentive to attack the blockchain exceeds the incentive to secure it?
Right now, the system exploits human greed to secure the blockchain via use of miner reward + fees. But can that greed not also work against the system if the thing that needs securing is more valuable than the reward for playing honestly? Securing property deeds and ownership being one example he used.

Agree with the above. You can also look at airbitz, I believe it's available under both iPhone and Android. Airbitz does a good job hiding a lot of the complexity including an encrypted cloud backup that happens automatically.

@_date: 2015-02-07 08:02:21
I think the question is less why wouldn't it be done but more how it could be done with bitcoins. The only way I could see this happening is that the loan isn't some bitcoins transfered over the blockchain but some kind of IOU from the loaner which is kind of how fractional reserve was done with gold and silver.
But back then, gold and silver is rather unwielding to carry around in large quantities. Not so with bitcoins so what reason and incentive would a borrower have to accept an IOU instead of the real bitcoins on the blockchain?
If we accept that there's no compelling reason to take an IOU substitution, that means the loaner would have to give the borrower the actual bitcoins locked on the blockchain. This is completely antithetical to running a fractional reserve where you have to be able to just create more currency units out of thin air.

That transaction remains valid as long as the inputs used is unspented.
For example, if you create another tx that uses the same inputs but send to a different output address and you broadcast *that* first, then your first tx is no longer valid -- broadcasting the first tx at that point will be rejected by the network as a double spend.

Pretty much any decent exchange will have those features as a baseline. You just need to set up an API key in your exchange account to enable buying/selling through the API.
Poloniex is pretty reputable and they have a lot of altcoin pairs you can trade.

tradeblock shows this as a conflicting transaction with 
My guess is the transaction malleability attack that's been going on. If you look at that multsig address:
you'll find two transactions with the same amount of bitcoins transfers but one has 16 confirms while the other is rejected as a double-spend. They both try to redeem the same previous output.

Why didn't you use a multisig escrow? If the answer is because they don't support that or not willing to that's a red flag and you shouldn't have done business with them.

Consider the electronic and computing industry where personal computers and smart phones is always getting cheaper and/or faster. That is a form of deflation yet it is working just fine.
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:02:06
Actually that's not true. They're similar in the sense that writing "1 pd" on a piece of paper is like creating a transaction that pays some btc to an address of your choosing with an empty input. (Also known as coinbase transaction).
However, for everyone to accept that transaction you created, you have to prove that you put in a certain amount of work into something. Unlike the first scenario where you can create virtually unlimited amount of "1 pd", you cannot do the same in the second scenario because you are inherently limited in the resources you can contribute to finding the right answer.
And that is the key difference between a "1 pd" that you write and how btc's come into existence from mining.

This is just talking about the mycoin ponzi scheme that was in the news a few days ago.
Near the end of the video, they(mainly the old guy in the middle) speaks of two big problems of bitcoin: 1. that it's deflationary and it doesn't adapt with a growing economy and 2. there are altcoins which can compete with bitcoin.
So in other words, the old guy doesn't get it.
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:29:58
Actually, I think the reverse might be better. The nodes publish and relay new blocks found on the network. The miners are the ones that construct a block and try to find a matching nonce that satisfies the difficulty.

There's a problem with either the script or the blockchain.info api where the number of tx field doesn't match the actual number of tx sent.
In other words,
    assert( len(addrdata['txs']) &lt; addrdata['n_tx'] )

Pretend you have a powerball machine with flying balls inside. It also has a special device that can read the molecules of an object. The molecule reader scans some object as input and that will cause the powerballs inside to fly around and spit out some combination of numbers out the other side.
What's important here is that scanning the exact same object always produces the same combination of numbers but you cannot tell what that actual random combination is ahead of time until you scan that object. If you break the object in half or change its molecules in anyway, the powerball machine will produce a completely different combination.
And this is essentially what bitcoin mining is about. Your task (or rather the computer's task) is to find some object + some other molecule, that when glued together, produces an output that's less than a specific number, called the difficulty target.
So you know what you're looking for but you don't know what combination of molecules produce that, as explained above. So the only way to find a solution is to keep changing the molecules you scan in until you get the right result -- that's brute forcing.
The result you solved therefore isn't useful for anything other than to just proof to others that you putted in the work and effort required. As long as the hashing algorithm isn't compromised (there are no shortcuts to the solution), others can be sure you did the work to find the solution through the laws of mathematics and probability.

What do you mean by support sending email/text? Do you mean sending the bitcoin address from the recipient to the sender over email/text so the sender knows where to send the funds? If so Airbitz already offers that.

That description is a bit misleading. The only part that involves a centralized service is when you first initialize a new mobile device and you download the encrypted wallet seed from the auth server.
Once that's done, you can create and sign transactions without ever having to contact the auth server.

From the wiki,


If they're lending 10k bitcoins out, that will have to come from the depositor's of the exchange. The total bitcoins mined, and by extension the money supply, hasn't changed at all, it's still the same.
Can someone explain how that wiki description makes any sense? Are they talking about bitcoin IOU's instead of the bitcoins that's locked up as an entry on the blockchain?

While I agree with most of your points, it's unclear if the market is preferring bitcoin's monetary policy over dogecoin's due to real merit or simply because of other factors like first mover etc.
As a thought experiment, imagine we invented a time machine and went back in time to convince satoshi to instead use dogecoin's inflationary recipe and later on, an altcoin comes out using bitcoin's recipe. IOW, dogecoin has bitcoin's first mover advantage and bitcoin is actually just another altcoin in this parallel universe. Would the same still hold true? Would the market gravitate from dogecoin towards bitcoin?

luckdragon's suggest is the first thing I'd try. If that fails, you might need to disassemble the laptop and get the HD out. You can connect that to another laptop or use an enclosing adapter and connect it to a desktop PC. From there you can just use a linux livecd to access the partition on it and fish out your private keys that way.
This all begs the question, why didn't you back up your private keys?

Can you site any real world case at a point in time in human history where this is true?
People aren't doing this for the case above and it's not even something I would consider essential to survive. Which means people will definitely spend bitcoins on things they need to survive like food, shelter and water etc. even if they know they can buy more of it tomorrow. Afterall, you can't eat a bitcoin.

But the problem is that turnaround is currently unacceptable(takes 5 days to a week). It takes way too long for the funds to transfer and during that time the exch rate would have changed. 
Why don't they just separate out the transfer process from buying/selling bitcoins itself? This way the transfer can take as long as it needs but once it's in your coinbase account, you should be able to execute buy orders for btc with the transferred balance.
With this separation, buy orders can be completed much more quickly. I would expect turnaround in this case to be &lt;24hrs rather than days.
