fair point and maybe i misread your tone, but i hate seeing people say shit about people that spent BTC when it was in its infancy. the people that spent it when it was new are the ones responsible for building it to what it is today.

except it wasn't half a billion dollars when he spent it so that makes no sense

I'm only 14 and can't afford much when it comes to bitcoin, but I'll see what I can do to get some money to you. Merry Christmas, and I love the work that you guys do.

This is the only way I've bought bitcoin, and although it's expensive it worked okay for me. I've done two transactions with them so far and everything went smoothly. However it isn't the cheapest or fastest method, they hold your coins about 48 hours before releasing and the fees were a bit expensive (20 dollars got me about 15 bucks worth of BTC). I should probably mention I'm not familiar with Indian currency, I transacted with US dollars but I can't imagine it being much different. Good luck to you getting some coin!

Hey bud, was on your website that you linked and noticed the second screenshot (Tealet's value) your company name is underlined as a misspelling. Cheers!
