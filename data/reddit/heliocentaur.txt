Its poppin to call them racists after the shit hole comment.  He, and his voters, have been painfully obvious in their racism.  
Calling them out for being racist will only get old when they have no power.
They are racist, xenophobic, anti-science, dogmatic, foolish, shameless assholes.  Original or not, im waving the flag.

I have mycelium now on phone.  Is the trading service a good feature?  Do you reccomend I use it?
Thank you.

I have heard some people that get paid in bitcoin change it directly to fiat.  I am imterested in holding a certain amount of bitcoin, but I was talking to my roommate about bitcoin, and he is interested in using it to receive payments for online services, but would be more happy if it was turnred directly into USD.  How would that be set up?  I used the tips/gifts you guys sent me to show him how to use the mycelium wallet, while also learning more myself.  Does he need an exchange for that?  Was I misinformed?  
So far, I really like the functionallity of the android wallet mycelium, i have yet to use the trader function, but am looking forward to it.

Its a homonym.  Its said the same out loud.  Who cares if you correct it or not.  You are helping no one.  Its a pet peeve of yours.  You are creating a justification for us to all have to hear about it.  Go away (not just you, all useless homonym fixers).

Wow that is amazing!  I did not have to do anything after you had the address to receive the funds?  For some reason I thought I had to hit some "accept" button.  I see I have just over 4 USD in my wallet now.  I am super excited to make my first purchase.  Thanks!

Can 	I use the trader funtion right away, or do I still need and exhange or have some kind of history to use it?
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-07-02 07:39:30
Cool.  Do I ever see/use the 'key' directly?  Or is that code like computer language I never see.  I have backed up my wallet and have a pin on it, so I think that is all I have to do.  Also, if I were to lose my phone, and for some reason mycelium was no longer available, could I recover those funds with a different wallet?
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:56:28
I have mycelium on phone now.  I am honestly not sure what the key is for my address.  I feel like a super noob.
If I get a coinbase account and verify it, I can take my coins off to a private wallet easily (I know at the risk of me screwing it up) right?  My research has told me to never leave bitcoins on an exchange.
Thank you for yoir help.

Thank you for your reply.

How was it unwatchable?  The clear dissemination of information?  The clever self deprication?  The good sound quality?
You only watched 10 seconds?  How the fuck would you know if it was watchable or not?  That is like looking at a quarter sized piece of a large painting and stating "I think it is garbage."  If you are so dense that shuch behaivior makes seems reasonable to you, fine, but you should keep to your self about it.

This is an excellent question.  Its my understanding a private wallet is better than a 3rd party wallet (is "private wallet" the right terminology?).
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:29:08
I did not realize it was safe to post your wallet address.  I will do just that, thank you.
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:32:04
I love betting, mostly poker though.  I try to not play aginst the house, but I guess to burn a few fractions of a dollar to learn to use bitcoin is a gpod excuse to play craps.

Wow, that is very kind of you.  I am reading a tutorial now on how to get a wallet.  I want a secure wallet I can use on my android phone (in america).  I am willing to have it be personal, but anonymous would be a perk.  Do you reccomend an android app for that, or is there another way to use bit coins with my phone (to buy coffee or whatever)?  I am willing to learn the required technical aspects to get the disired functionality.
Thank you!

Do you understand what that means?  Pimps beat women and take the majority of their money.  If prostitution is legal, the workers (whores) can have rights.  They can avoid STDs and not get murdered (by johns or pimps).
Not all situations where prostitution is illegal are that bad for the whores, but most are.  Not all situations where prostitution is legal are far better for the whores (and johns), but most are.  
People as a group want whores, just like they want drugs.  Making these things illegal only helps law enforcement agenceies to make profits, and strengthens black markets and gangs.  The only way you could ever be rid of these things entirely is to have a massivly oppressive police state with orwellian type government oversight of every persons daily lives.  That is a world I do not want to live in.  
I have never used the services of a hooker.  I have lived where it was legal, and where it is illegal.  When I lived where it was legal, I knew that the rights of whores had a fighting chance to be protected.  Where I live now?  Who knows.  And who knows how many people are smuggled into the country as slaves to that industry.  I have no idea how any person could come up with such a figure.  
Might as well tell me how many of my neighbors are smoking crack, not getting caught, and not telling any one about it while you are at it.
TL;DR: Victimless crime behavior control laws not only do not work to their intended effect, but have consequenses worse than what they semmingly attempt to prohibit.

I just connected my reddit profile to change tip.  It seems i recieved the tip you sent me in addition to the direct peer to peer gift you sent me.  I did not intend to double dip.  Should i send a tip back to you or a peer to peer transaction?  Or am I mistaken?  Eithet way, tank you again for your interest in my education im bitcoin.

Why would greece not allow access to safe deposit boxes if there was no chance of them taking the contents?  I think the point was that to transfer wealth, if it were in bitcoin, they could move it where they want it, and buy gold or whstever.  If it were in gold in a greek safe deposit box, GL.

For the mycelium on droid, I see it on google play.  Its pemissions want 'identity' and 'location'.  Is this a secure app?  I am guessing it is, but thought I would ask before just downloading it.  I see the reveiws on google play are generally outstanding.
Is it anonymous in nature, or do I need to give it my name and bank info to use?
Thank you for your help.

I do not care if it is know that I ever bought bitcoin, but since the tech offers possible anonymity and I believe in my right to privacy, I thought it would be good to know how to make a anonymous private wallet with anonymous bitcoins on it.
