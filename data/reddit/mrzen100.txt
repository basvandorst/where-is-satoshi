I'm not the most informed, by any means. I do recall mention somewhere in the subreddit that people are working on long term solutions. A change in the block size is very simple with practically zero chance to cause unexpected issues. Any complicated algorithm/coding has much greater potential for bugs and issues. So lots of testing and experimenting us warranted before actually implementing it. In the mean time we've got the debate over whether or not to make the bandaid bigger.

I've been reading about the necessity of multiple keys or wallets for security. Can I put that off for a bit to get a handle on the program or is it more urgent?

Maybe I'll pass this over to my wife and see if she'll get started with it.

It's America if you count Hawaii. We got plenty if shops around here that are cash only.

What's the general set up to accept bourbon as a business? I'm thinking of helping a woodcarver friend of mine to get set up with this stuff

Sounds like I won't be switching anytime soon, but I would be interested in hearing some of the pros and cons.
I'm using mycelium for now. In gonna wait a bit to get more familiar before I turn on 'advanced' mode using the separate wallets
