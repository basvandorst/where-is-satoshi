Normally, I'm not a big fan of shitposts, but I'll give this one a pass, lol.

Just to be clear guys. I don't agree. Just relaying the article.

It's funny how I make one post about an implied romance between characters in a game, and while stalking, you come across it and call that an infatuation. As for me being a loser. I am a loser. I can admit that, but so are you, and you're in denial. As for my "opinions about bitcoin" it's still not even at 8k. Your prediction is completely unrealistic and just made to build up hype, but you don't have to admit it. When February rolls around again, and it's still hanging around 10k, you'll look like enough of a fool to satisfy me.

Oh shit! I must have forgotten that 7k is close to 20k... oh wait, it's not. In fact, ironically, it's gone way down in value since you posted that.
Btw, you can insult me for playing a Square-Enix game if you want, but tell me this, in between trying to scam people out of their money, what do you waste YOUR life on? Because I can guarantee you that whatever it is, it's a waste and has no impact on the world. Then try to explain why whatever you waste your time on is somehow less pathetic than what I choose to waste my time on?
You see, I at least prefer to play games that have a story to experience and learn from, as opposed to time-wasters like Destiny, in which the only story is to "shoot the bad guy".

No, I'm beyond the anxiety. I was just calling out your bullshit. Apparently, the way you deal with losing an argument is to stalk their profiles and attack them on a personal level. Really accents that asshole look. Good job! I've only seen a few other people wear it better.
@_date: 2018-07-23 15:34:03
Lol, you're a moron. I had anxiety because my father went into the ER with meningitis, but way to show your colors as an assumptive asshole. The look fits you.

What is this app and why is it special. I can't find much info on it. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places?
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:17:38
Aren't there laws against this?
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:37:47
IT went over. I know. I'm not a fool. It does fluctuate. I said it would stay right around 10k, which means it could even go a bit over and my prediction would be accurate. You still have 92k to go for your prediction.
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:35:48
LMAO. I have bitcoin you moron. I just have realistic expectations about it. You're just lying to and misguiding people, so that they'll buy in and increase the value so you can cash in. You're the type of person that guarantees people it will hit 100k, then sells at 95k. It's manipulative, dishonest, and it pisses me off.
@_date: 2018-07-23 13:32:35
Ok, I WAS done, but I would just like to point out to anyone coming through here that this guys got so butthurt, that he opened my profile, searched through several of my posts, just to find one where I said that I had been dealing with anxiety, in order to reply to it with "Lmao what a loser".
I just want to publicly show everyone how much of a pathetic loser this person is.
I genuinely hope this comes back to bite you in the ass later.
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:10:02
Lol. You're a moron. You don't know anything about currency value clearly. It's practically impossible for Bitcoin to reach 100k by the end of the year. In fact, you'd be lucky if it hit 17k again any time soon.
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:08:21
Lol, all you said was "yeah, I'm an asshole, but why shouldn't I be?"
Oh, and by-the-by, you didn't say that bitcoin caps at 100k, you said that it would pass 100k by the end of the year, which not only directly counters the idea that you thought it capped at 100k, but is also one of the most ridiculous predictions I've ever heard. If it even hits 20k within the year, I'll eat my own shoe. You're just a hype man. You get inexperienced people hyped up about it so that you can have a bigger cash in, taking the money from them. Essentially a scam artist. 
I think I'm done here.
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:15:13
Oh please. You absolutely insulted my choice in games. 
As for being done here, I changed my mind after you stalked my profile and attacked me based on unrelated issues. 
Oh, and solar energy requires very limited materials. Anyone that actually works in the industry would not claim that it could save anything, much less have an impact on the energy crisis. Maybe you'll see things more clearly once you are out school and have a bit more experience with some of the challenges of adulthood. THEN come back and lecture me about how important it is to not spend my down time discussing a new game that I enjoy. It makes a bit more sense to enjoy levity when you actually have things to be stressed about.

Log scale = "make my chart look bullish" setting

Why would you want to? Everything from $0.30 to $1000 is pretty much irrelevant now.
