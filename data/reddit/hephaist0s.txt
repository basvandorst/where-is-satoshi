I think part of the difficulty is that people don't understand money to begin with... but they all think they do. We treat money like it's air or water, just this basic thing we all use without questioning, so when someone comes along and says "Let me tell you about New Air" it immediately sounds suspicious.
I also find it difficult because there is no easy explanation -- any short explanation leaves out so much detail that it sounds like you're selling something, but if you actual get into explaining the underlying principles it takes forever and everyone falls asleep, assuming they are able to follow along in the first place. It's tough.

I bought a Walmart card this weekend by doing the Gyft card &gt; Walmart card translation, and I got no points at all from either transaction, which was a bit disappointing. I've used bitcoin with Gyft many times before and always gotten the points.
On the plus side, bought some groceries -- AND the Walmart grocery section carries wine &amp; beer!
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:17:25
I wasn't making a big deal about the lack of points, I was just making an observation. Now that's I've looked more closely at the pages for the different cards, it seems pretty clear that they don't give points for the GYFT card itself -- at least, no points are listed next to it when you go to buy it, unlike all the other cards. I just hadn't noticed that before. There's probably a reason for it.
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:25:27
I've refreshed/restarted the app, and still no new points. At a guess, maybe they don't give points for buying the GYFT card itself (ie the card which can then be used to buy other cards) -- maybe that's the one exception.

Simply asking "What is more practical at this moment, a credit card or bitcoin?" is a question whose answer is so obvious that there is little point in writing an article about it. It's just not an interesting question.
Equivalent questions would have been asking in 1900, "What is more useful, one of the first cars or a horse?" or in 1991, "What is more useful, the Internet or the Post Office?" The answers are obvious, but those questions do nothing to shed light on the potentials of the underlying technologies.

It's also pointless to blithely compare the very young bitcoin ecosystem to the fully mature credit card payment infrastructure.

I was just thinking this.

@_date: 2014-06-28 18:49:41
The share price tanked because one person on bitcointalk.org waged a ceaseless, nonstop campaign of posts arguing that Peta-Mine could never make money, and also that mining is fundamentally unprofitable and all bitcoin securities are essentially scams.
So even though this past week's dividend represented a 4.7% return on current share price (in one week!), and Peta-Mine has consistently performed well and evolved to changing conditions over the past 9 months, share price continues to collapse.
The underlying issue is the immaturity of the bitcoin securities markets. A bunch of posts on a forum shouldn't be able to drive the market -- but they can.

Yeah, I really don't think there was any malice either. They wanted to accept MasterCoin because the MaidSafeCoin tokens would be issued using the Master Protocol and so it just seemed right to do so, but they didn't anticipate the volume and demand and thought they'd be fundraising for a month, not a few hours. 30 minutes in (and a few million dollars) they saw they were getting far more MasterCoin than they expected, so they made a quick decision and tried to adjust things on the fly.

It was a bad move -- I agree! -- but it was voted in nearly unanimously. 
I also think the vote itself (to pay out 100% dividends and stop reinvestment) was actually spurred by the incessant, relentless trolling on bitcointalk.org. PetaMine had showed really good faith in how they reinvested and grew the mine, and they had a great track record of both performance and communication, but then they went through 2+ months of constant trolling calling them a scam 24 hours a day. I think the management thought, "Ok, fine, how about we just make this a straight, fixed-rate cloud mining share, then -- that way there's nothing to criticize, because anyone can do the math." So they put it up for a vote and it passed with flying colors.
And here we are.

No, it's not between the lines. It's in the lines: "Another differentiator from the Trezor, however, is the price, which at $239 is more than twice the price of a Trezor for very similar functionality – and the Trezor itself is sometimes criticized for its price, since competitors such as Ledger offer their own entry-level smartcard-based hardware wallet solution (the HW.1) for less than $20."

I can't get over how great the Mycelium folks seem to be. It's a great wallet, then they introduced the peer-to-peer exchange functions, then they made the Entropy device, and now the Trezor support is just awesome. They didn't have to do that -- a micro-usb to micro-usb connection isn't an obvious choice -- but I love it and now I can't wait to get one of those cables!
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:18:45
Exactly. Smartphones make bitcoin very convenient... but less secure. The Trezor - Mycelium connection helps a lot with that second part. Plus, it's a first-class excuse to carry your Trezor around with you, you know, to show people how cool it is.

Same experience here, but with Trezor. Once you follow the link, it then tells you the repository has been moved, then when you go to the new location there are more steps and instructions. Multibit HD, though, supports it with no problem.

Agree. 24 word seed, one letter at a time... even though you don't have to do all of every word, it still took forever. I worried I was wearing out the buttons, I did more button-presses on that one restoration than all other transactions combined. I think you can choose a 12 word seed, wish I had.

Here's an old write-up I did on the Trezor, but it's 3 years old and doesn't reflect all the updates /added functionality since launch. Still, I think it's a decent overview of the device: [
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:44:58
The Trezor is also great -- I'd call it a toss-up, or a matter of personal preference. The Trezor web wallet currently supports BTC, Litecoin, Dash, Ethereum and Zcash, but might support others via other platforms, not sure. I suppose if Trezors are in stock, that's a bit of an advantage.
@_date: 2017-07-07 21:33:17
Ok, thanks -- I thought that only applied to their earlier wallets, the HW.1 and original Nano, which had no moving parts and were basically just chips on a card. I didn't see anything about smart cards in the product description for the Nano S.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:33:28
Agree about pin -- easier on Trezor. Plus, with the latest firmware on the Nano S, they went from a 4 number to an 8-numberPIN, more secure but very tedious. Glad it let me keep my 4-number PIN.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:01:09
I don't know about environmental tests -- I've babied my devices. Yes, you absolutely need to keep the seed written down somewhere, both devices force you to do that as part of set-up. Neither device has a battery, so there's nothing to run out there. I've had the Trezor for 3 years, and the Nano S for about 8 months, no troubles yet.
@_date: 2017-07-08 06:59:50
I think ease-of-use is another advantage of a hardware wallet -- you may be able to keep a single key secure in a number of ways, but how easy is it to conduct dozens, or hundreds, of transaction while maintaining that same security? Hardware wallets aim to be both  easy to use and secure.
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:46:59
You can use the Trezor with Electrum -- best of both worlds!
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:46:46
I like them both, but what does "smart card security" and "recovery on device directly" mean in this case?

@_date: 2017-06-06 11:37:46
Mycelium is a great wallet. Supports Trezor, Ledger, BIP38 encrypted wallets, lets you buy BTC from other users or from vendors within the app... so many features. I'd have gladly paid for a non-ad version. Could have paid with bitcoin in the wallet...  Doesn't seem like they know their audience / thought this through.
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:40:35
Yes, this. They've been involved in the BTC space for a long while, they've done crowdfunding for new devices like Entropy, they really haven't been able to make any money all this time? The trickle of ad revenue seems trivial next to other opportunities.

I was watching the price all day, and it didn't occur to me to think of it as a "crash" until I saw stories coming out later, all repeating this same exciting idea of a crash -- when, as has been noted many times here already, it was still up from where it had been only the day before. There have been a few momentary down spikes of similar magnitude in the past few months (from 94-75; from 50ish to 40something), we just didn't have awesome reporting to misunderstand and mischaracterize them.

It IS a horrible article. They give BFL a handy mouthpiece, without taking any steps at all to question their easily-refutable bullshit claims. Yeah, sure, everyone who's mad at BFL is just trolls. Poor BFL, shouted down by all those darn trolls. 
How many times in your life have you preordered something which cost more than $1000, it arrived more than a year late, and by the time it arrived it was nearly worthless. (And by the way, in the meantime, other companies announced, designed, made and shipped comparable products.) Oh sure, BFL critics are just manipulating the market... ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:09:56
It's open-source, so how is it different than trusting any wallet program?
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:00:13
I no longer feel for BFL. When they were, 1 ,2, 4 months late, I sympathized -- making stuff is hard. When ASICMiner and Avalon got their chips finished first, I sympathized -- after all, BFL was jumping ahead to a 65nm process. When they started shipping in the spring, but the initial wall of orders was hard to break through so they remained hung on Day 1 orders for weeks, I sympathized -- supply chains are tough.
Now it's 5-6 months later, and they are further behind now on their shipping than they were the day they shipped the first SC Single. They have solved none of their supply problems, shipping problems, production problems, or fundamental human communication problems in the past 5 months. In that same time period, electronics hobbyists have designed, prototyped and produced working boards for both BFL and Avalon chips... sometimes in just a few weeks. I have no idea what these fucking BFL guys are doing. In must just be rank incompetence, right? It is not a scam, since they really do have chips, and products -- but why on earth can't they ship them? Imagine the truckloads of additional money they'd have made if they'd at least MOSTLY caught up on their pre-orders, and people could order new units with moderate confidence? Millions and millions. 
This line kills me: 
"...the Kansas-based firm has recently struggled to keep up with demand as it is currently manufacturing more units per day than it can dispatch and verify."
No fucking way are they manufacturing more units than they can ship. They've gone a whole WEEK not shipping anything from a given product line, and you can't tell me that's because they ran out of boxes. And even if it was, they've had 5 months to fix it. It's fucking nuts. And a lot of lies.

It's insanely frustrating. It turns out that if you ordered a Single (their flagship) in September of last year, you still don't have it. If you ordered a Jalapeno any time, from June 23, 2012 through January 2013, you've received it. But at the time of ordering the Jalapeno was the least cost-effective, and because of its slower speed it wouldn't be the choice of the serious miner, but as it turned out you could have ordered dozens of jalapenos and had a serious mining farm up and running months ago. Of all the promises they've broken, that one was the hardest to see coming.

In contradiction of its headline, the story doesn't even say that FinCEN intends to do anything, or has stated that it will do anything... it's just speculation about something the author thinks could possibly happen. Nothing new has actually happened; no one has taken aim at anything; there is no news here.

I'm not getting it. You say that you "do make it pretty clear" that there aren't any bitcoins inside them, but where in your bullet-point list in the OP do you say that? And how can you really say that they are valued in bitcoin? You provide a tool, seemingly, to measure the value of the bullion in bitcoin, but that's just a calculation. In fact, the BTC denominations printed on the coins are not tied to anything at all. I feel that the language of your original post is actually designed to confuse the public, and possibly fool them. That puts your whole endeavor on pretty shaky ground, to say it politely.

Yep. Never in my life have I received so many pieces of expensive electronics with no instructions whatsoever in the box. Don't get me wrong, the challenge is fun, but this sure isn't  consumer electronics land, where everything has 2 manuals (quick and long), each in 8 languages.

Agreed -- everyone is quick to defend Krugman by his credentials, but in this case it's those credentials that make his recent writing about bitcoin shameful. No matter how smart he is, his writing on this subject isn't showing that -- in fact, he comes across as just another lazy blogger who hasn't done their research. His piece "Adam Smith Hates Bitcoin" seems to miss the point of mining entirely, as he calls it a foolish waste of resources without ever acknowledging that mining is what makes the transactions go. One can't even tell, from that piece, if he even understands it. In the new piece, he essentially says that since we already have PayPal and credit cards, why would we need bitcoin? That's lazy too, since bitcoin has several advantages over those systems (virtual lack of fees and universal availability being just two), but instead he just singles out anonymity and presents that as the only possible reason anyone would want to use bitcoin. Again, I have trouble reading that without thinking that he doesn't really understand the subject he's writing about.
Should he be challenged with more respect? Maybe. Has he shown respect to his subject matter, or to his responsibility, as a person whose voice has great weight, to use that voice responsibly? No.

Defective how? Just curious. I received a jalapeno with a loose heatsink -- one of the two screws was stripped, so it was at an angle, didn't touch one of the chips, AND stuck up into the fan, so it made a racket and that's how I knew something as wrong. I guess it could have passed testing, then broke loose during shipping... dunno. Anyhow, it's no excuse for the poor quality, but it was a fixable problem, and it's hashing away fine now -- better than losing time on the refund / exchange.

It's pretty, but I'm not in love with it. Information is important: show us the balance in bitcoin first, local currency second. Show us a list of recent transactions, so we remember what we've been doing with this particular wallet -- because we probably have several wallets. Use bitcoin terms -- "addresses" not "contacts"; yes, I understand that part of the goal is to make bitcoin more accessible, but if we use precise terms, we educate at the same time, and we all end up speaking the same language.

Singles are still on August 2012... only 7 weeks into the order queue.
@_date: 2013-09-13 02:33:45
They're actually shipping more slowly than they took orders. They started shipping Singles (their flagship product) a few months ago, but are only about 7 weeks into the order queue (Aug. 2012). That means instead of catching up, they are now farther behind now than when they shipped the first Single... and they were already almost a year behind at that time. Logically, that means something ordered today will ship MORE than a year from now. It's just math.
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:05:18
This is very exciting! It looks great! 1 BTC is a fair price for something new and first-of-its-kind, but triple-price for the metal case is tough. Because of course I want the metal case... but the price makes it so obviously a vanity feature that I'd feel guilty blowing the dough on it. So far, the indecision is stopping me from ordering either one...

From the bitcointalk thread, it appears that these coins are all identical, and thus contain no bitcoin or key to control any wallet; if that's the case, then I think that should be much clearer in your description. While I'm sure they're lovely, if they don't even have any bitcoins in them, they're, well... not physical bitcoins in any meaningful way. You should call them bitcoin themed medallions.

OP has every right to be frustrated, but you're talking about a brand-newly-designed product being a week late. 
They're also a brand-new operation, just newly haven taken over the order handling from burnin.
They're also deploying their own massive new mining farm using that same technology (for now) -- so they've got a lot going on, and a whole lot of new. There's a lot that can go wrong.
I received a BitBurner Fury and it works great. Sending up an alarm and encouraging refunds after only a week's delay seems unreasonable and cruel to me. I realize many in the community (myself included) have been burned by spectacularly terrible delays and customer service, but the flip side is that if we really demand that every start-up offer the same seamless purchasing experience as Amazon, then we should just buy from major corporations.

No, I am no longer confused that your product is not any more linked to bitcoin than any other item a human can sell for cash, then take the cash to an exchange and convert into bitcoin. I'm also no longer confused  that "cold hard cash physical bitcoins" are at best an empty bit of marketing in an attempt to cash in on the interest in bitcoin, and are at worst fraudulent. Please point out in your original post, either here or on bitcointalk.org, where you "make it pretty clear" that there aren't any bitcoins in your product.
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:23:33
Right! The best possible outcome of their silly rationale; fair enough. It's sloppy, though -- why not use their new BTC to learn more about BTC? Eh, whatever.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:01:39
So friedcat has seen not only the future of bitcoin, but of computers themselves. On top of that, ASICMiner's mining strategy goes much deeper than simply pumping out gen-two chips -- in a game where no one can seem to see more than 3 months into the future, they're actually trying to position themselves as a dominant player for years to come. Darn impressive stuff.

I'll throw this into the mix: Of the ten BFL miners I ordered, of different types and at different times, all took about a year to arrive, which was almost a year past the scheduled ship date; additionally 3 out of the ten were defective, which is an awesome 30% failure rate.
1 Jalapeno arrived with the heatsink broken loose inside the case, so it stopped the fan from turning.
1 Jalapeno ran insanely hot; upon opening it up, the fan was not plugged in.
1 Single SC is running hot because one of the fans isn't turning. I haven't cracked it open yet to try to fix it.
Admittedly, this didn't stop me from mining with any of them, but it's still pretty poor quality control.
@_date: 2013-08-31 21:00:51
That's a great point. I didn't realize either -- the last spike was so exciting, it seemed like it went on and on, I didn't remember that it happened *so* quickly. My memory is very fallible.

It takes about an hour to move the BTC into OKPay, at which point they are converted into currency at slightly below whatever the exchange rate happens to be at that moment. You then must move the funds specifically into the debit card, which can take just a few minutes if you pay an extra $3 to express the transaction, or it can take a few (or several) hours if you don't.
@_date: 2013-08-26 23:31:17
Are you trolling? People who ordered singles in week two (beginning of July 2012) still haven't got them. There's an ocean of hate. Jalapenos though, if you'd ordered a hundred anytime between July '12 and January '13, you'd be sitting pretty... but heck, there was no way to foresee that.

It's rushed and poorly thought out; it sounds like he just wanted to write something funny, and as a list to boot. Yippee for him, but a waste of everyone else's time.
And by the way, I'm sick of people mocking bitcoin enthusiasts for being enthusiastic. It's such a cheap shot. Maybe we get excited about bitcoin because it's a fascinating technology that we genuinely believe in because we understand it. Are we supposed to be impressed that he just believes in the same crap that everyone else believes? What a tool.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:07:13
When you buy a Casascius coin, you pay 1 + x BTC and then you receive a piece of metal with 1 BTC in it, and Caldwell keeps the amount x as payment. The 1 BTC was already yours, so all you are buying from Caldwell is the metal container -- so the transaction is at its root no different than buying *any* object with BTC. To characterize this as licence-able "money transmission" is obnoxious at best, but isn't it more likely that they (FINCEN) just don't know what they're even doing?
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:05:55
Agreed! I've been using Mycelium alongside Bitcoin Wallet for a while, and Mycelium's features are great -- it does much more, and has more options for control. My only grievance was that I thought the graphics were kind of clunky, but now it looks super slick. Great job!

Their blog is also worded awkwardly. They say that bitcoin is their most requested topic, then ask what exactly people want to know, then ask if people really care.

@_date: 2013-09-03 20:07:02
Ok. From your goals:
• Create a durable and attractive specie for Bitcoin.
-- "specie" means "money in the form of coins," so when you say "specie for Bitcoin" you seem to be saying "money in the form of coins for Bitcoin," yet the coin you have made has no bitcoin value any more than any other object which may be sold for cash and then exchanged into bitcoin, so it is hard to see how  your "specie" is "for Bitcoin."
• Provide a floor backing in hard physical asset for Bitcoin as a global currency.
-- How on Satoshi's Green Earth do your silver bullion coins provide a backing for our favorite cryptocurrency?
• Pieces ought be easily carried and useful for trade at point of sale...
-- This gives the impression that these coins might be exchanged for goods and services at a point of sale. That seems strikingly far-fetched.
• Support both completely anonymous and non-anonymous transactions...
-- How does a piece of silver support anonymous transactions? Do I leave it under a rock?
• Provide a bridge to non-bitcoin users so that the bitcoin economy may expand through the use of this innovative offering.
-- How, reasonably, might the bitcoin economy expand through distribution of silver bullion with the word "bitcoin" on it, which itself has no intrinsic link to bitcoin? It might be good for awareness, but so are stickers, and that's a far cry from expanding the economy.
Actually, forget it; this is tiring. The real question is, which of your lines aren't wildly misleading and arguably false?
This is so easily fixed. Just put in a line declaring that the coins contain no bitcoins and hold no intrinsic bitcoin value. If you refuse to do that, then you are hoping to confuse, and possibly trick people.
That's the feedback you came here looking for.

Yes; it was just clickbait. But, you can't be entirely sure unless you read it, right?

[insert something discouraging about the quality of public discourse].
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:47:33
The thing is, I'd have no issue if you were just up front about it. Just say they're ornamental, or commemorative, or in celebration of bitcoin -- anything like that. And that their only value comes from the bullion, and the collectible value. Just say it. Say it contains no bitcoins. That's the right thing to do.

I love this idea so much -- it has fun written all over it. A great thing to give as a gift, and teach about bitcoin and mining at the same time. The recipient can follow the price of BTC, check the mining revenue they're receiving at the address, AND track the price of silver. I ordered a few for myself, but I feel like I should be giving these to all the younger members of my family too.

These are beautiful, and look like a lot of fun. I ordered a bunch yesterday, can't wait to see them! The website works very smoothly, and  I received a shipment confirmation, and activation numbers, today. It seems like a very polished operation, and a great way to give some bitcoins to the uninitiated in a very economical and colorful way. Everything about the transaction so far has inspired confidence.
@_date: 2013-09-01 15:22:14
Yes. This is one of the most commonly repeated misunderstandings: OMG there are only 21 million bitcoins! This gets reprinted in articles over and over and over again, and it's a very solid test for whether or not the author is talking out of their ass.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:11:22
I don't think Chinese mining is as big a factor in either bubble or crash. I'm not sure it actually fits into the OP's (very thoughtful) analysis.
For one thing, the article about the mining farm appears to be an article about ASICMiner, a major mining player since bitcoin was at $8, so their effects on the markets are entirely long-term.
I also doubt that Chinese bitcoin mining was affected much by the recent boom in price and popularity in China, if only because it take so very long to deploy mining hardware. Bitcoin mining hardware that has been deployed in the past few months was, to a large degree, ordered 6 months ago.
China had a lot of mining farms before the surge in popularity, so now that people in China are getting out of BTC, the Chinese farms probably don't represent any greater glut of supply than they did before the surge.

Ugh. Well, I have no idea what the problem is, but opening it up isn't hard -- there are 4 star bolts hidden under the rubber foot pads, just carefully peel off the pads and you'll see them. Those bolts run all the way up to the top of the case, so if you take them out, just watch out as everything will sort of tumble apart. Proceed with caution, as I imagine this voids warranty.

The too technical / simple dichotomy is tough. Once you know how to work it... it's simple. Simpler than many things. When you don't know how it works, it seems like dangerous black magic. The best analogy I've seen is credit cards in the 1970's -- a bank account number, a credit card number, and expiration date too? And now, a security number on the back?! Holy crap, so complicated! But now this is second nature to everyone, but somehow Bitcoin seems impossibly technical.

I dunno. If an outside-the-box, unconventional-economics podcast can't find anything worth covering in the entire bitcoin universe, then I don't think they're doing their jobs. Or they're just asleep.
I don't really understand why they're asking the public, "hey, what should we write about?" Why don't they do the research and illuminate us as to what they think we should know? That would be grand. That would be journalism.

It's unlikely he kept all 600,000BTC in one single wallet, of any kind. It would make much more sense to spread that around, and have multiple ways to access it.
