Bitcoin subreddit logic:
-Some person said something bad about bitcoin.
-Dig deep and find something even slightly unethical in person's past.
-Post it and discredit person and his opinion in general.
This applies to banks, rating agencies, persons,...
Scientology actually uses the same methods.

@_date: 2017-02-28 09:15:36
So what? This answer refects the arrogance of this sub and the Segwit supporter on the debate. We have the better programmers, so no other opinon matters.  Roger seems to be at least trying to enable businesses to use bitcoin in a bigger scale and listens to their concerns.  No big merchand will ever accept bitcoin even if we double tx/sec and Roger really seems passionate about providing solutions for wide-adoption.  The segwit supporter is kinda naive claiming high fees don't matter(even 100$ fees). They do. I am paying around 40ct/tx in fees. I never payed a cent in banking fees for this kind of transaction. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 10:31:13
Eventually a solution like this could appease all parties involved in the scaling debate. As Segwit probably never will reach 95% and BU will never get support for their solutions.  At some point in time, the pressure to scale will become so existential that every party involved will have to make some concessions.  Has Core released a statement yet, what will happen if Segwit won't activate?  Right now the scaling debate feels like the cold war with total victory as an option. And we will need a consensus with consessions made by all parties in order to scale at all.

German tax expert here:  bitcoin is taxed like gold. This means if you hodl your bitcoin for one year, no need to pay any tax. Not even Kapitalertragssteuer which applies to stock etc.  
Zugewinngemeinschaft is pretty clear: Let's say you told your wife about your bitcoin and you get divorced, she'll be entitled to half of the rise in price between the day of the divorce and the day of your marriage.  
Example: You bought 10 BTC at 500€ in 2016. On 8th of feb 2017 you get married. BTC is at 990€. You divorce on 8th of feb 2019. BTC price is at 2000€.  She'll be entitled to ((2000-990)*10)/2. Hopefully you get married on the peak of a bubble, she might have to pay you in that case...

As a netural person to the scaling debate, this is an interesting video. Downvote me as much as you want, but I think Roger Ver made the best points and at least provided a good vision of BTC scaling. He might not have gone into technical details but you can't discuss every single technical detail in a 1 hour debate.  I really wished we could have a neutral debate without the hate going on, automatically delegitimizing everything just because it is coming from Ver or other groups with different views. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:03:20
Nope, that is the classic argument for US bank customers. In germany: You don't pay for your bank account, you don't pay for your credit card, you don't pay for your debit card and in store you pay as much paying cash as paying with your credit card or debit card. So BTC is not very appealing if you pay 40ct/transaction. But thats only for germany and most european countries. I understand that things are different overseas. But transaction cost was only a part of my argument why mechand adoption is not yet very common. And I welcome anyone trying to foster wide-adoption, even if his name is Ver.

You are totally correct, the business owner pays even a lot more than 0,3-0,5%. But I was talking about attracting new users into the bitcoin economy: Try convincing someone to use another form of cash (btc) where you have to pay 0,5-1€ for every single transaction. You'd get laughed at.  You have to relate to the simplest non tech savy person without an econ degree in order to make your arguments for wide-adoption: 1. simpler 2. faster 3. more practical 4. cheaper (or at least not more expensive for the user) 5. safer  
And how often does a normal european person wire money to japan in comparaison to daily cash transactions?  BTW wiring money to most european countries is free too.

Mods please step in:  Since when has r/bitcoin become a place to promote personal attacks? This post has nothing to do with bitcoin and/or the development/adding value to bitcoin and its economy.    
This post is clearly trying to collect cheap upvotes because somehow Roger Ver is the devil himself in this sub. 
Are we all 10 year old girls on tumblr or on the leading sub for a potentially diruptive technology? Please argue his technical/strategical views and not his person.  
 Your post broken down:  
 Roger Ver is not a programmer  
(so what?, are only programmers allowed to have an opinion?)  
, is not a academic  
(so what? is anyone checking for academic degrees in this forum?)  
, he actually went to prison for selling on ebay fire crackers.  
( exactly! for selling firecrackers on ebay! In most states he would have paid a small fine)  
He bought bitcoin early and now he's rich.  
(Exactly? What is wrong with that? Are you jealous?)  
 He claims bitcoin cant have high fees,  
 (well btc shouldn't. Mass adoption is impossible with fees that high. So he is right and has the health and growth of the system in mind. I always laugh out loud when Core supporters claim 100$ fees but a safe system is the way to go)  
 and he's dedicates his life in spliting the community to the point of centralisation.

Just a quick hint as a european: even in the very unlikely event of the euro being abolished, bitcoin will never ever ever ever reach 1m/btc. Not even 50k/btc. European ppl would rather buy tons of gold for insane prices than buying bitcoin. No european older than 35 would seriously consider buying bitcoins. And 65+ yr old ppl have all the money in europe.  I am saying this as a serious bullish hodler btw.

There is no formula.  
But just use some common sense: For 1 BTC to reach even 10000$ now, the 300mio$ must have an effect of  9200$*16000000=147,2 billion $  
Sure thing it will drive up market cap by more than factor 1 but never ever by factor 490.
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:04:00
Honestly that would take too long. I'll just scratch the surface: Gold most likely has a "market cap" of 7T USD (numbers vary, based on the amount ppl think is in existence)  
Only around 33% of gold is bought by investors.  So your relevant market cap is more likely 2.31T USD.  And dont tell me bitcoin will take over derivative market values. This is just quite impossible by the nature of a derivative.  So if all investors transfered their money into bitcoin, price would be 110.000 USD-ish. And this event is almost impossible.  How should we get to 1M?  And I won't go into details with gold having a 2600 year long tradion as money, store of value, industrial use, jewelery,...   A comparison of BTC with the whole gold market is just nonsense.  Claims like "1M/BTC soon" is why ppl believe BTC is a ponzy scheme. Let's just stay realistic, appreciate the technology and hope for the best.  But stop spreading the 1M/USD nonsense.

"a 300 million dollar rush into bitcoin would dramatically push the market cap and price up into the tens of thousands of dollars!"  
He thinks the price for one btc will rise into the tens of thousands if 300 mio$ is invested. Realistically a 300mio$ investment would drive up the market cap by maybe 1 billion in total. So maybe 50$ per btc and not tens of thousands.

Another prime example of of some self-proclaimed expert.   
Just a quick hint:   New market cap != current market cap + amount of money flowing into market   
What happens if 14 billion $ are quickly invested in bitcoin adding to the current 14 billion $ market cap?  
A new market cap of 28 billon $ as stated in the article?  
Thats not how market cap works. It will be &gt;&gt;&gt;28 billion $
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:07:33
Depends on the market: 500$ is a bit high.  500$ might be realistic if the Winkelvosses just placed an order "buy bitcoin at any price for 300mio$".  Then we would have a bubble for 2 or 3 days and after that a crash down to maybe +100$.  
But as they are not stupid they will invest the 300mio$ in smaller increments over time, not building a bubble. A sustainable increase of market cap would not be higher than 1billion$ with a 300mio$ investment: + 50-70$ per bitcoin.

Bullshit. Please read the PDF before spreading libertarian conspiracy theories. 
Most measures are already in place in EU states. This is just for harmonizing on a EU level.  As a law abiding citizen your rights are not in jeopardy by having to declare large cash transactions. We're talking in the 100.000€++ range.  No citizen buys a house for 300.000++ in cash. And the abolition of the 500€ bill is a right step to prevent money laundering. We're just getting on the same level as in the states where you can't just carry around 5M€ strapped to your body because of the small volume.

That is the answer for people who have dealt with bitcoin for a long time, that's right. But if you want to lower entry barriers for ppl totally stranger to bitcoin it could be a very important step. 
I am not talking about network consensus. It could just help if BTC exchanges displayed mBTC values. 
Imagine a merchand in india buying a month's income worth of BTC. He could have 0.12 BTC or 120 of whatever you want to call it. 
In daily life it would be easier to handle conversions if you can get a rough estimate without a calculator.

 Also when using BTC in real life:
People can't relate to 0.0376354BTC and can't grasp the real value. They'd have to calculate 0.0376 x 730. 
In mBTC or call it whatever it would be 3.76 which could be easily converted for ppl to USD 3.76 x 0.73 or 1:1 if we cross 1000USD/BTC again

Well being overly optimistic, the denomination might have to be adapted several times over the years. 
Imagine having to pay for a train ticket at Satoshi/USD parity: 0.0000002 BTC is impossible to understand. Even counting the zeros is impractical. 20 Satoshi or whatever is a much more realistic concept/value.
That's why right now at roughly 1000 USD per BTC (+-50%), mBTC would be perfect.

Just a quick technical question:
Say I have some BTC in my cold storage. After the fork I send some to my mobile wallet.
The remaining BTC in cold storage can be split into BTC and BCH.
What about the BTC I sent to my mobile wallet? Can they still be split after sending them out after the fork? Can BTC sent endless times and still be split into BCH until it has been done?
From my understanding the BTC transaction after the fork is not registered on the Bcash ledger. How can BTC sent after the fork be linked to the Bcash?

Just got their mail and checked out the deal:  
they are asking for 1.121.286 € for 2% equity.  
This puts bitstamp's valuation at roughly 65 mio €.  
Now lets have a look at their revenue:  
Daily volume btc/eur today: 954btc  
Daily volume btc/usd: 5504btc  
Daily volume usd/eur 143380 eur  
Fee is 0.25% on all transactions:  
954 * 0.0025=2.385btc * 710eur/btc= 1693eur  
5504 * 0.0025=13.76btc * 710 eur/btc= 9770eur  
143380eur * 0,0025 = 358eur  
Rough estimate of daily revenue: 11820eur  
Lets add to that 10% from their other revenue streams cc etc.   
Daily revenue: 13.000eur  
Yearly revenue: 4.745.000€  
And thats only revenue not profit!  
Imho a fair valuation would be at around 15mio euros and they are off by 333%   
No thanks, I won't invest.   
I am a happy customer but their valuation is way over the top even if you price in a huge growth rate.
Better buy some bitcoins instead.
