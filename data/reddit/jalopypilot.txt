Is this really done with something like WordPress? If so I may have to do a little digging and try out some tutorials. I was always interested in trying to make some nice looking personal webpages.

I'll take it one step further and assume it's Canada. I have a hard time believing an American paper would show an old Canadian two dollar bill in it. 
Speculating even further, I'll take a shot in the dark and guess that's a Hamilton Spectator newspaper.

How do you think this stacks up against the one built by legendary motor car a few years back?

Hamilton Spectator?

Is that true? I'm not an expert by any means, but most of the drooled over performance muscle cars I've come across were manual.

Hey you're the guy that gave me my very first bitcoin a month or so ago. I have been researching it a fair amount ever since and just the other day purchased a small amount to play around! (Although I wish I hadn't been so passive about it considering how much it's blown up the past week). 
Although transferring is dead easy, I still haven't found a good way to actually convert my hard earned dollars into BTC. It all seems either tedious or shady.
Anyway, just wanted to say thanks!

I used quickbt.com which was definitely nice and simple to use, but:
* can only buy 0.03 BTC at a time
* they had a pretty ridiculous fee (19%)
* don't seem to be offering a reasonable rate at the moment. ($980 USD/BTC)
Edit: typos

I'm in Canada and if I'm not mistaken they were US only.

Isn't that how localbitcoins works?

Thanks, again. You're awesome!
And unfortunately, I am not in the US. Coinbase was one of the first resources I came across and definitely looked like one of most user friendly. I'm awaiting verification in a few places... vaultofsatoshi.com has caught my eye in the past few days.
When I was reading up on localbitcoins it felt like getting into a bit of a weird drug deal. Maybe I'll have to give that one another shot.
