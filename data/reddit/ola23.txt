**Your name is "searchfortruth", well I suggest you "search for truth" by reading the white paper to understand how NXT works before commenting, here it it: 
As valamor said the network governed by maths and software which is  no different from the bitcoin network providing info on which is the longest chain. Moreso there is a 720 block reog limit and a cumulative difficulty right from the genesis block which I believe is a doubling target value every block that help all nodes on the network determine what the long what the correct chain is. The doubling target value is a network wide value that each "forging eligible node" compares their hit value against each block in order to win the right to forge. There is simply no way to fake these safeguards, thats all. You have been told the truth and I have pointed you in the right direction to educated yourself. Now educate yourself and stop propagating the antithesis to the your reddit handle. There is also no sense or time to argue endlessly, just read the paper and you will become wiser to the ingenuity of NXT**

yep there is so much that could be done with the protocol to solve a lot of problems we deal with everyday. I for one am very excited to see what the heck will happen once the pioneers like the mastercoin layer or bitshares replicate the financial backbone to the economy including securities and exchange into a peer to peer model...then all hell will breaks loose. As for the never-ending imitations...the market will choose accordingly to push down or discard less than useful "mee toos". It could be that for the project owners, these extremely replicable projects serve as stepping stones for growth to begin to challenge themselves to do better.

Nope wrong again! You have heard of localbitcoins right?? Well coinsigner is way more legal than they are...I have spoken with as many qualified people as you mention also...At no point are any bitcoin available or stored on coinsigner just to say the least (no wallet or escrow wallet)...We just provide tools for people to use the blockchain in Innovative ways. That's the beauty of the bitcoin protocol.

I did not see this in time....
First of all I think unfair too classify me as everyone else wanting bitcoin investment without knowing my background and history. I am not a newbie to bitcoin and certainly not in one in regards to corporations.
I am a veteran entrepreneur and I have dealt with  various pro formas regarding investments, company structure etc. So to answer your question yes I do know how corporations work because I have was a founder to one prior to my current endeavor. 
To address your confusion about the ambiguity about the proposed structure of the company; is not set in stone that is why I am also seeking advisers to guide the process. But the goal is to follow in a similar non conventional footstep to satoshi dice I am sure you have heard of it??
Here is a link if for some reason this escaped your research 
"People earn bitcoins by becoming mediators"
This is a revenue share model between coinsigner and the mediator for each contract. So yes we do take a cut, I have updated the post to reflect this...
"all this without a bank? you will have investors and owners, do you understand how corporations work?":   Again yes all without a bank and I do know how corporations work.
In regards to your questions about the POS system let it be known that there are several solutions out there. Bitpay being one of them. As a matter of fact they want companies and marketing specialist to spread the use of their system. The branding is in regards to additional material that will be provided to the retailers so they are aware that their is an alternative "coinsigner" out there. Also the snarky tone is really not needed, just reflects and extremely childish and rude personality.

The guy proposing this open source decentralized market solution is pretty reputable and I suspect his technical skill are on par with his reputation. He has been pretty helpful with discussions on a lot of technically adept discussions. check out the solution here:  
In other news, did you guys know that I am working on a decentralized bitcoin to fiat exchange? there are details here if you are interested:

"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." You manage to do all of the first 3 by yourself today, but not win. Don't worry though, winning is down the line, when your ability to think and analyze objectively benefits your  future children you might not be able to say the same for majority of them. Because you made the best investment decisions based on intuition and intelligence. 
You have first mover advantage my friend, they will come around. Just get productive in the bitcoin industry

That is why I told you to review the business model and idea all over so you can get a better idea of how this works. First of all there is no intent to work with banks..secondly everything is strictly bitcoin-centric. And the last part of your sentence sums up exactly what we are doing to a certain extent. It is software, a p2p software tool in eventuality using several ecryption schemes and p2p protocol components. We do not need to engage with banks, but customers are obviously free to to do so for transfers and for proving those transfers..So no we are not touching any transactions, please read the plan again.

Guys Its ola from Coinsigner.. I have posted a resource with information that will answer all your questions here:  
@_date: 2013-10-05 06:04:09
You are confusing this plan with one such as mtgox which depends on having some financial ties to financial sevices, banks or bank accounts. Eventually the solution will be a p2p software like bit torrent. Please read up so you can accurately see what this plan is about.

Thank you for the kind feedback. I wake up everyday thinking why any group with the capability haven't already built this..
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:48:39
Use this guide...there are videos that take you through the steps. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 02:47:35
We need reproduction and mass funding of growth tools like these. maybe the merchants will buy some of these...
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:07:22
exactly my sentiment
@_date: 2013-10-05 01:07:19
Yep, it is needed, been thinking about it for a very long time. The default scenario is the current scenario.. I can keep working on it by my self and it can easily take me 1 year to have a beta version. Reason being I still have to work to pay bills. I have done the research....its not Illegal..You are assuming this is a "MSB" nope far from it. You should re-review the guidelines(Fincen's) and our business model. Also there is a plan to completely host the business off the US and around the world...
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:41:30
he should respond. He is a pretty helpful guy
@_date: 2013-10-05 01:28:48
is localbitcoins used in the US? Have you heard any fuss from anyone? Point is you do not have to be an MSB to provide people with tools to accomplish what they would normally accomplish in a decentralized manner. I suppose satoshi square is also illegal also? I rest my case...
@_date: 2013-10-05 01:12:05
I have done the research....its not Illegal..You are assuming this is a "MSB"...It is very far from it. You should re-review the guidelines(Fincen's) and our business model.

why does it have to end with an expletive??
