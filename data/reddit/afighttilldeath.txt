Monero was the best performing coin in 2016...

Well, typically other cryptocurrencies perform better than Bitcoin - you simply need to wait about six months. I came in late last year and made killins on Siacoin, Monero, Ripple, Golem, etc. I think though the hype bus left more or less after the trollbox was removed from Poloniex. I'd recommend diversifying in well-established coins like Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum, and maybe go for ones that may have a bright future. Personally, only own mostly Monero, no Bitcoin, siacoin, ripple, and other coins I find have great potential.

The more transactions the higher the likelihood of spillage. Spillage = loss of Bitcoin for whatever reason.

So the security of Bitcoin is hinged on Bitcoin transactions which may or may not be a good enough incentive?

Yes, if Coinbase doesn't support BCC which from their emails it looks like they don't.

If you keep your Bitcoins on Coinbase, you will only have 10 BTC and not 10 BCC ALSO. People are telling you to transfer to a wallet you own so you get both versions of Bitcoin.
Hard forks are simply a mandatory software upgrade that has complications if the community is split on which side to pick (the old version or the new one). Btw, Monero is having a hard fork in Sept (they do it approx. every 6 months) and noone's freaking out.
